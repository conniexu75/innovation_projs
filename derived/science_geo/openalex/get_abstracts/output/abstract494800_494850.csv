KDM6A (UTX) and KDM6B (JMJD3) are KDM6 subfamily members that catalyze demethylation of Nϵ-methylated histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27), a mark important for transcriptional repression. Despite reports stating that UTY(KDM6C) is inactive as a KDM, we demonstrate by biochemical studies, employing MS and NMR, that UTY(KDM6C) is an active KDM. Crystallographic analyses reveal that the UTY(KDM6C) active site is highly conserved with those of KDM6B and KDM6A. UTY(KDM6C) catalyzes demethylation of H3K27 peptides in vitro, analogously to KDM6B and KDM6A, but with reduced activity, due to point substitutions involved in substrate binding. The results expand the set of human KDMs and will be of use in developing selective KDM inhibitors. The Jumonji C lysine demethylases (KDMs) are 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases.

Lysine histone Nϵ-methylation is a ubiquitous post-translational modification that can signal either for transcriptional repression or activation in a site- and context-specific manner. Methyl group addition is catalyzed by the lysine methyltransferases, and its removal is catalyzed by members of either or both of two histone lysine demethylase (KDM) 3The abbreviations used are:KDMlysine demethylaseJmjCJumonji C2OG2-oxoglutarateH3K27histone 3 lysine 27H3K27Memethylated H3K27PDBProtein Data BankANFatrial natriuretic factorFLfull-lengthWTwild typeHIFhypoxia-inducible factorFIHfactor inhibiting HIF. families (1Black J.C.

The largest family of KDMs comprises the Jumonji C (JmjC) enzymes, which are 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)-dependent oxygenases. The smaller family of lysine-specific demethylases are also oxidizing enzymes, but they belong to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent amine oxidase superfamily. JmjC KDMs can catalyze removal of all three methylation states of lysine Nϵ-methylation from most (but not all) known methylated histone lysine residues, with methylation state and residue selectivity varying between members (2Walport L.J.

Despite sharing >88% similarity with its X chromosome-linked homologue, KDM6A/UTX (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein on the X chromosome), the third Y chromosome-linked family member, UTY(KDM6C) (ubiquitously transcribed tetratricopeptide repeat protein on the Y chromosome), is reported not to have KDM activity (7Hong S.

Like KDM6A, the UTY(KDM6C) gene manifests in multiple splice isoforms (11Laaser I. Theis F.J. de Angelis M.H. Kolb H.J. Adamski J. Huge splicing frequency in human Y chromosomal UTY gene.OMICS. 2011; 15: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). UTY(KDM6C) is a minor histocompatibility antigen that may induce graft rejection of male stem cell grafts (12Vogt M.H. Goulmy E. Kloosterboer F.M. Blokland E. de Paus R.A. Willemze R. Falkenburg J.H.

Characterization of the critical polymorphic amino acid residues for T-cell recognition.Blood. 2000; 96: 3126-3132Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both UTY(KDM6C) and KDM6A form part of the MLL3-MLL4 H3K4 methyltransferase complex, which also contains RbBP5, ASH2L, and WDR5 (8Lee M.G. Villa R. Trojer P. Norman J. Yan K.P. Reinberg D.

Sengoku T. Yokoyama S. Magnuson T. UTX and UTY demonstrate histone demethylase-independent function in mouse embryonic development.PLoS Genet. 2012; 8: e1002964Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). H3K27 methylation is tightly linked to gene regulation (14Martin C. Zhang Y. The diverse functions of histone lysine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar). The gene promoters of repressed chromatin are enriched in K27Me2 and K27Me3, whereas in the gene bodies of active regions of chromatin, K27Me1 is found (15Schneider R. Grosschedl R. Dynamics and interplay of nuclear architecture, genome organization, and gene expression.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3027-3043Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). By removing methylation at H3K27, KDM6 family members regulate transcription; for example, human KDM6A is involved in HOX gene regulation during development, with importance in body patterning on the anterior-posterior axis (6Agger K. Cloos P.A. Christensen J. Pasini D. Rose S. Rappsilber J. Issaeva I. Canaani E. Salcini A.E. Helin K. UTX and JMJD3 are histone H3K27 demethylases involved in HOX gene regulation and development.Nature. 2007; 449: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (994) Google Scholar), and in mice, KDM6A activates expression of female-specific RHOX genes involved in sexual reproduction (16Berletch J.B. Deng X. Nguyen D.K. Disteche C.M. Female bias in Rhox6 and 9 regulation by the histone demethylase KDM6A.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1003489Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments predict that KDM6A/UTY(KDM6C) have similar domain organizations (Fig. 1, A and B), with N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domains of unknown function and C-terminal JmjC and zinc binding domains (although not assigned in previous studies, sequence analysis suggests that KDM6B may also contain tetratricopeptide repeat-like domains). Within the catalytic JmjC domains, KDM6A and UTY(KDM6C) share >96% similarity; KDM6B is less similar, sharing only ∼80%. UTY(KDM6C) contains all three of the predicted iron-binding residues as well as those predicted to be important in 2OG binding (Fig. 1B). There is evidence that the biological roles of KDM6A and UTY(KDM6C) extend beyond H3K27Me3-related demethylation. KDM6B and KDM6A regulate transcription in a non-catalytic manner via their interactions with T-box proteins (17Miller S.A. Weinmann A.S. Molecular mechanisms by which T-bet regulates T-helper cell commitment.Immunol. Rev. 2010; 238: 233-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 18Miller S.A. Mohn S.E. Weinmann A.S.

Cell. 2010; 40: 594-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, KDM6A and UTY(KDM6C) are capable of H3K27 demethylase-independent gene regulation (e.g. in regulation of Fnbp1 expression, which is thought to be mediated by alteration of H3K4 methylation levels), and both are suggested to have distinct functions in mesoderm development (13Shpargel K.B.

Utx is required for proper induction of ectoderm and mesoderm during differentiation of embryonic stem cells.PloS One. 2013; 8: e60020Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recent work reveals a sex-dependent effect after KDM6A knock-out in embryonic stem cells and mice. Some male KDM6A-deleted littermates survive to birth, whereas in the females, KDM6A deletion is embryo-lethal (13Shpargel K.B. Sengoku T. Yokoyama S. Magnuson T.

Cell. 2012; 22: 25-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, KDM6A is also known to escape X chromosome inactivation, resulting in a dosage imbalance between males and females (23Greenfield A. Carrel L. Pennisi D. Philippe C. Quaderi N. Siggers P. Steiner K. Tam P.P. Monaco A.P. Willard H.F. Koopman P. The UTX gene escapes X inactivation in mice and humans.Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of UTY(KDM6C) is associated with an increased risk of male cardiovascular disease (24Bloomer L.D. Nelson C.P. Eales J. Denniff M. Christofidou P. Debiec R. Moore J. Consortium C. Zukowska-Szczechowska E. Goodall A.H. Thompson J. Samani N.J. Charchar F.J. Tomaszewski M. Male-specific region of the Y chromosome and cardiovascular risk: phylogenetic analysis and gene expression studies.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2013; 33: 1722-1727Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There is thus interest in defining the roles of KDM6A and UTY(KDM6C) from both the basic science and therapeutic perspectives. Despite the reports that UTY(KDM6C) is not an active KDM, the combined sequence analyses and cellular results suggested to us that, like KDM6A, UTY(KDM6C) might indeed be a functional KDM. To investigate this possibility, we produced the catalytic and zinc-binding domains of UTY(KDM6C) and characterized them by crystallography and turnover assays. The results reveal that UTY(KDM6C) possesses KDM activity but, at least when tested in vitro in recombinant form, at a substantially lower level than for KDM6A/B. This is, at least in part, due to substitution of an isoleucyl residue in KDM6B and KDM6A for a prolyl residue in UTY(KDM6C). UTY(KDM6C) activity is also inhibited by small molecule probes developed as KDM6B inhibitors (25Kruidenier L. Chung C.W. Cheng Z. Liddle J. Che K. Joberty G. Bantscheff M. Bountra C. Bridges A. Diallo H. Eberhard D. Hutchinson S. Jones E. Katso R. Leveridge M. Mander P.K. Mosley J. Ramirez-Molina C. Rowland P. Schofield C.J. Sheppard R.J. Smith J.E. Swales C. Tanner R. Thomas P. Tumber A.

A selective jumonji H3K27 demethylase inhibitor modulates the proinflammatory macrophage response.Nature. 2012; 488: 404-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). The finding that UTY(KDM6C) is a functionally active KDM therefore has consequences both for its biological role and in interpreting the results of small molecule studies targeting KDMs. DNA encoding for the JmjC domain and zinc binding domain of human UTY(KDM6C) (residues Pro818–Ser1347, isoform 3, GI: 33188431) was amplified from a clone kindly provided by Kai Ge (Addgene plasmid 17439) (7Hong S.

DNA encoding for the full-length protein (isoform 3) was amplified from the same plasmid and inserted into a pcDNA3-N-FLAG-LIC vector for mammalian expression. Constructs encoding regions Leu878–Ser1347 and Ser840–Ser1347 of UTY(KDM6C) were amplified from an Origene cDNA clone (isoform 3) and cloned into a pFastBac-derived vector containing a tobacco etch virus protease-cleavable C-terminal His10 tag. KDM6B and KDM6A plasmids were used as described previously (25Kruidenier L. Chung C.W. Cheng Z. Liddle J. Che K. Joberty G. Bantscheff M. Bountra C. Bridges A. Diallo H. Eberhard D. Hutchinson S.

UTY(KDM6C) variants were generated using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Recombinant proteins for biochemical assays were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and UTY(KDM6C) for crystallography was produced in Sf9 cells. All proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200). KDM6A and KDM6B were purified as described previously (26Rose N.R. Woon E.C.

The UTY(KDM6C) plasmid (Pro818–Ser1347) was transformed into competent BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells and expressed as an N-terminal His6-thioredoxin-tagged protein in Terrific Broth medium. When the A600 reached 0.6, the temperature was dropped to 18 °C, and the culture was induced with 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. After 16 h, the cells were harvested and frozen at −80 °C. The thawed pellet was resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol with 10 μg/ml DNase I with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was clarified by high speed centrifugation. The lysates were purified using a HisTrap™ HP 5-ml column (GE Healthcare). After loading the lysate, the column was washed with 20 column volumes of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1 mm DTT, 5% glycerol; protein was then eluted with an imidazole gradient up to 250 mm imidazole over 20 column volumes. The concentrated fractions of protein were further purified using a 300-ml Superdex 200 preparation grade column pre-equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 5% glycerol. The purified protein was concentrated, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. For Sf9 cell expression of UTY(KDM6C) (Leu878–Ser1347) and UTY(KDM6C) (Ser840–Ser1347), generation of recombinant baculoviruses, insect cell culture, and infections were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The recombinant proteins were expressed in Sf9 cells, and the cells were collected 72 h postinfection. The cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 0.4 mm PMSF, 0.64 mm benzamidine, and a proteinase inhibitor mix (Calbiochem), and the protein was purified using nickel affinity chromatography using a stepwise gradient of imidazole. The eluted protein was then incubated with tobacco etch virus protease at 4 °C overnight, followed by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200). The tobacco etch virus protease and uncleaved protein were removed using nickel affinity chromatography, and the mass of the cleaved UTY(KDM6C) was verified by electrospray mass ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent LC/MSD). In separate experiments, partially phosphorylated UTY(KDM6C) was treated with λ-phosphatase at a molar ratio of 1:40 simultaneously with the tobacco etch virus protease, and the mass of the dephosphorylated UTY(KDM6C) was verified by electrospray mass ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Agilent LC/MSD). The phosphorylation site was identified by trypsin digestion followed by MS/MS. Crystals of UTY(KDM6C) were obtained using protein expressed and purified from Sf9 cells (Leu878–Ser1347, isoform 3) using the sitting drop vapor diffusion method at 4 °C by mixing protein and crystallization buffer in a 1:1 ratio in a final volume of 150 nl. Crystals of the UTY(KDM6C)-2OG complex were grown in a drop consisting of 75 nl of protein (9 mg/ml) and 75 nl of a precipitant solution containing 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 0.2 m trimethylamine N-oxide. To crystallize UTY(KDM6C) with GSK-J1, the protein was preincubated with a 1 mm concentration of the inhibitor. The protein-compound mixture was then transferred to crystallization plates, and crystals were obtained in a drop consisting of 75 nl of protein-compound mix (6.4 mg/ml) and 75 nl of a precipitant consisting of 15% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m magnesium formate. Crystals from both experiments were cryoprotected with mother liquor supplemented with 25% ethylene glycol before they were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Data sets were collected on beamline I03 and I04-1, respectively, at the Diamond Light source. A UTY crystal was analyzed using x-ray fluorescence scanning on beamline I02 at Diamond Light Source on a Vortex-EX fluorescence detector (Hitachi High-Technologies Science America Inc.). A peak for zinc (observed peak at 8641.47 eV, expected peak at 8638.9 eV) and a peak for iron (observed peak at 6532.67 eV, expected peak at 6403.8 eV) were observed as expected based on the structural work (see below). No peak for nickel was detected. The first data set collected for UTY(KDM6C) showed a maximum resolution of 1.80 Å. The data were processed with XDS (28Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11232) Google Scholar) and were scaled and merged with Aimless (29Evans P.R. An introduction to data reduction: space-group determination, scaling and intensity statistics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2011; 67: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar). Phases were calculated with Phaser within the CCP4 Suite by molecular replacement using KDM6A (PDB code 3AVS) as a search model (30Sengoku T. Yokoyama S.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening was carried out with Parrot to improve density (32Cowtan K. Recent developments in classical density modification.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 470-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), and the initial model was used in Buccaneer to be completed in automated model building (33Cowtan K. Fitting molecular fragments into electron density.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2008; 64: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The model was further improved by subsequent cycles of model building in Coot (34Emsley P. Cowtan K. Coot: model-building tools for molecular graphics.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar) and refinement in Refmac5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Refinement of macromolecular structures by the maximum-likelihood method.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13855) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2132726700,"Despite the number of extensive studies on the immune function and signaling of inflammasomes in various diseases, the activating mechanism of inflammasome, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome, is not fully understood. Nuclear factor E2-related Factor-2 (Nrf2), a key transcription factor that regulates cellular redox homeostasis, has been reported to play both protective and pathogenic roles depending on the disease conditions through undefined mechanism. This study reveals an essential role of Nrf2 in inflammasome activation. LPS stimulation increased Nrf2 protein levels in a Myd88-dependent manner. When compared with wild-type controls, Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2(-/-)) macrophages showed decreased maturation and secretion of caspase-1 and IL-1β and reduced apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC) speck formation in response to various NLRP3 and AIM2 inflammasome stimuli. In contrast, NLRC4 inflammasome activation was not controlled by Nrf2. Biochemical analysis revealed that Nrf2 appeared in the ASC-enriched cytosolic compartment after NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Furthermore, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-induced NLRP3 activation also required Nrf2. Nrf2(-/-) mice showed a dramatic decrease in immune cell recruitment and IL-1β generation in alum-induced peritonitis, which is a typical IL-1 signaling-dependent inflammation animal model. This work discovered a critical proinflammatory effect of Nrf2 by mediating inflammasome activation."
https://openalex.org/W1993030431,"Olfactory perception is mediated by a large array of olfactory receptor genes. The human genome contains 851 olfactory receptor gene loci. More than 50% of the loci are annotated as nonfunctional due to frame-disrupting mutations. Furthermore haplotypic missense alleles can be nonfunctional resulting from substitution of key amino acids governing protein folding or interactions with signal transduction components. Beyond their role in odor recognition, functional olfactory receptors are also required for a proper targeting of olfactory neuron axons to their corresponding glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Therefore, we anticipate that profiling of olfactory receptor gene expression in whole human olfactory mucosa and analysis in the human population of their expression should provide an opportunity to select the frequently expressed and potentially functional olfactory receptors in view of a systematic deorphanization. To address this issue, we designed a TaqMan Low Density Array (Applied Biosystems), containing probes for 356 predicted human olfactory receptor loci to investigate their expression in whole human olfactory mucosa tissues from 26 individuals (13 women, 13 men; aged from 39 to 81 years, with an average of 67±11 years for women and 63±12 years for men). Total RNA isolation, DNase treatment, RNA integrity evaluation and reverse transcription were performed for these 26 samples. Then 384 targeted genes (including endogenous control genes and reference genes specifically expressed in olfactory epithelium for normalization purpose) were analyzed using the same real-time reverse transcription PCR platform. On average, the expression of 273 human olfactory receptor genes was observed in the 26 selected whole human olfactory mucosa analyzed, of which 90 were expressed in all 26 individuals. Most of the olfactory receptors deorphanized to date on the basis of sensitivity to known odorant molecules, which are described in the literature, were found in the expressed olfactory receptors gene set."
https://openalex.org/W2059769058,"Cardiotoxicity is a dose-limiting side-effect of cancer chemotherapeutics such as anthracyclines. The drug-induced cardiac toxicity is currently monitored with repeated assessments of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) using multigated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography (MUGA) or echocardiography. However, the plasma cardiac biomarker B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) has been suggested for early identification of cardiac dysfunction. The aim of the study was to compare LVEF obtained by MUGA and plasma BNP as predictors of developing congestive heart failure (CHF) or death in a population of anthracycline-treated cancer patients. Methods We prospectively followed 333 cancer patients referred to our department for routine monitoring of LVEF with MUGA and measurement of BNP, January-December 2004. Study end points were hospitalization for CHF and death during follow-up 2004-2010. Data were obtained from the Danish National Patient Registry. Results During follow-up (mean 1,360 days), 21 of the patients were admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of CHF and 194 of the patients died. BNP levels were significantly higher and LVEF lower in the group of patients that developed CHF. Using cut-off points of BNP>100 pg/ml (HR 5.5; CI 1.8–17.2; p = 0.003) and LVEF <50% (HR 7.9; CI 3.0–21.4; p<0.001) both significantly predicted CHF. Using the same cut-off points only BNP (HR 1.9; CI 1.3-2.9; p = 0.002) and not LVEF (HR 1.1; CI 0.7–1.8; p = 0.58) was predictive of overall death. In multivariate Cox analysis both BNP and LVEF were independent predictors of CHF while age remained the only independent predictor of overall death. Conclusion In cancer patients treated with cardiotoxic chemotherapy both BNP and LVEF can significantly predict subsequent hospitalization with CHF. In addition, BNP and not LVEF has a prognostic value in detecting overall death. This prospective study based on the hitherto largest study population supports BNP as a clinical relevant method for monitoring chemotherapy-related cardiac failure and death."
https://openalex.org/W2042204087,"Background Large-scale genomic analyses of patient cohorts have revealed extensive heterogeneity between individual tumors, contributing to treatment failure and drug resistance. In malignant melanoma, heterogeneity is thought to arise as a consequence of the differentiation of melanoma-initiating cells that are defined by cell-surface markers like CD271 or CD133. Results Here we confirmed that the nerve growth factor receptor (CD271) is a crucial determinant of tumorigenicity, stem-like properties, heterogeneity and plasticity in melanoma cells. Stable shRNA mediated knock-down of CD271 in patient-derived melanoma cells abrogated their tumor-initiating and colony-forming capacity. A genome-wide expression profiling and gene-set enrichment analysis revealed novel connections of CD271 with melanoma-associated genes like CD133 and points to a neural crest stem cell (NCSC) signature lost upon CD271 knock-down. In a meta-analysis we have determined a shared set of 271 differentially regulated genes, linking CD271 to SOX10, a marker that specifies the neural crest. To dissect the connection of CD271 and CD133 we have analyzed 10 patient-derived melanoma-cell strains for cell-surface expression of both markers compared to established cell lines MeWo and A375. We found CD271+ cells in the majority of cell strains analyzed as well as in a set of 16 different patient-derived melanoma metastases. Strikingly, only 2/12 cell strains harbored a CD133+ sub-set that in addition comprised a fraction of cells of a CD271+/CD133+ phenotype. Those cells were found in the label-retaining fraction and in vitro deduced from CD271+ but not CD271 knock-down cells. Conclusions Our present study provides a deeper insight into the regulation of melanoma cell properties and points CD271 out as a regulator of several melanoma-associated genes. Further, our data strongly suggest that CD271 is a crucial determinant of stem-like properties of melanoma cells like colony-formation and tumorigenicity."

Moreover, genetic alterations in the PORCN gene lead to focal dermal hypoplasia, an X-linked developmental disorder. Despite its physiological importance, the biochemical mechanism governing Wnt acylation by Porcn is poorly understood. Here, we use a cell-based fatty acylation assay that is a direct readout of Porcn acyltransferase activity to perform structure-function analysis of highly conserved residues in Porcn and Wnt3a. In total, 16-point mutations in Porcn and 13 mutations in Wnt3a were generated and analyzed. We identified key residues within Porcn required for enzymatic activity, stability, and Wnt3a binding and mapped these active site residues to predicted transmembrane domain 9. Analysis of focal dermal hypoplasia-associated mutations in Porcn revealed that loss of enzymatic activity arises from altered stability. A consensus sequence within Wnt3a was identified (CXCHGXSXXCXXKXC) that contains residues that mediate Porcn binding, fatty acid transfer, and Wnt signaling. We also showed that Ser or Thr, but not Cys, can serve as a fatty acylation site in Wnt, establishing Porcn as an O-acyltransferase. This analysis sheds light into the mechanism by which Porcn transfers fatty acids to Wnt proteins and provides insight into the mechanisms of fatty acid transfer by MBOAT family members.

https://openalex.org/W2013619202,"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contribute to lens protein pigmentation and cross-linking during aging and cataract formation. In vitro experiments have shown that ascorbate (ASC) oxidation products can form AGEs in proteins. However, the mechanisms of ASC oxidation and AGE formation in the human lens are poorly understood. Kynurenines are tryptophan oxidation products produced from the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated kynurenine pathway and are present in the human lens. This study investigated the ability of UVA light-excited kynurenines to photooxidize ASC and to form AGEs in lens proteins. UVA light-excited kynurenines in both free and protein-bound forms rapidly oxidized ASC, and such oxidation occurred even in the absence of oxygen. High levels of GSH inhibited but did not completely block ASC oxidation. Upon UVA irradiation, pigmented proteins from human cataractous lenses also oxidized ASC. When exposed to UVA light (320-400 nm, 100 milliwatts/cm(2), 45 min to 2 h), young human lenses (20-36 years), which contain high levels of free kynurenines, lost a significant portion of their ASC content and accumulated AGEs. A similar formation of AGEs was observed in UVA-irradiated lenses from human IDO/human sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter-2 mice, which contain high levels of kynurenines and ASC. Our data suggest that kynurenine-mediated ASC oxidation followed by AGE formation may be an important mechanism for lens aging and the development of senile cataracts in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2089964302,"Intense exercise is a physiological stress capable of inducing the interaction of neutrophils with muscle endothelial cells and their transmigration into tissue. Mechanisms driving this physiological inflammatory response are not known. Here, we investigate whether production of reactive oxygen species is relevant for neutrophil interaction with endothelial cells and recruitment into the quadriceps muscle in mice subjected to the treadmill fatiguing exercise protocol. Mice exercised until fatigue by running for 56.3±6.8 min on an electric treadmill. Skeletal muscle was evaluated by intravital microscopy at different time points after exercise, and then removed to assess local oxidative stress and histopathological analysis. We observed an increase in plasma lactate and creatine kinase (CK) concentrations after exercise. The numbers of monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes in blood increased 12 and 24 hours after the exercise. Numbers of rolling and adherent leukocytes increased 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours post-exercise, as assessed by intravital microscopy. Using LysM-eGFP mice and confocal intravital microscopy technology, we show that the number of transmigrating neutrophils increased 12 hours post-exercise. Mutant gp91phox-/- (non-functional NADPH oxidase) mice and mice treated with apocynin showed diminished neutrophil recruitment. SOD treatment promoted further adhesion and transmigration of leukocytes 12 hours after the exercise. These findings confirm our hypothesis that treadmill exercise increases the recruitment of leukocytes to the postcapillary venules, and NADPH oxidase-induced ROS plays an important role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2072325791,"Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data can provide estimates of evolutionary rates and timescales. Nearly all phylogenetic methods rely on accurate models of nucleotide substitution. A key feature of molecular evolution is the heterogeneity of substitution rates among sites, which is often modelled using a discrete gamma distribution. A widely used derivative of this is the gamma-invariable mixture model, which assumes that a proportion of sites in the sequence are completely resistant to change, while substitution rates at the remaining sites are gamma-distributed. For data sampled at the intraspecific level, however, biological assumptions involved in the invariable-sites model are commonly violated. We examined the use of these models in analyses of five intraspecific data sets. We show that using 6-10 rate categories for the discrete gamma distribution of rates among sites is sufficient to provide a good approximation of the marginal likelihood. Increasing the number of gamma rate categories did not have a substantial effect on estimates of the substitution rate or coalescence time, unless rates varied strongly among sites in a non-gamma-distributed manner. The assumption of a proportion of invariable sites provided a better approximation of the asymptotic marginal likelihood when the number of gamma categories was small, but had minimal impact on estimates of rates and coalescence times. However, the estimated proportion of invariable sites was highly susceptible to changes in the number of gamma rate categories. The concurrent use of gamma and invariable-site models for intraspecific data is not biologically meaningful and has been challenged on statistical grounds; here we have found that the assumption of a proportion of invariable sites has no obvious impact on Bayesian estimates of rates and timescales from intraspecific data."
https://openalex.org/W2061994471,"Background Bypass of foregut secreted factors promoting insulin resistance is hypothesized to be one of the mechanisms by which resolution of type 2 diabetes (T2D) follows roux-en-y gastric bypass (GBP) surgery. Aim To identify insulin resistance-associated proteins and metabolites which decrease more after GBP than after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) prior to diabetes remission. Methods Fasting plasma from 15 subjects with T2D undergoing GBP or SG was analyzed by proteomic and metabolomic methods 3 days before and 3 days after surgery. Subjects were matched for age, BMI, metformin therapy and glycemic control. Insulin resistance was calculated using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). For proteomics, samples were depleted of abundant plasma proteins, digested with trypsin and labeled with iTRAQ isobaric tags prior to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Metabolomic analysis was performed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The effect of the respective bariatric surgery on identified proteins and metabolites was evaluated using two-way analysis of variance and appropriate post-hoc tests. Results HOMA-IR improved, albeit not significantly, in both groups after surgery. Proteomic analysis yielded seven proteins which decreased significantly after GBP only, including Fetuin-A and Retinol binding protein 4, both previously linked to insulin resistance. Significant decrease in Fetuin-A and Retinol binding protein 4 after GBP was confirmed using ELISA and immunoassay. Metabolomic analysis identified significant decrease of citrate, proline, histidine and decanoic acid specifically after GBP. Conclusion Greater early decrease was seen for Fetuin-A, Retinol binding protein 4, and several metabolites after GBP compared to SG, preceding significant weight loss. This may contribute to enhanced T2D remission observed following foregut bypass procedures."
https://openalex.org/W2150124834,"The low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) is crucial for cholesterol homeostasis and deficiency in LDLR functions cause hypercholesterolemia. LDLR is a type I transmembrane protein that requires O-glycosylation for stable expression at the cell surface. It has previously been suggested that LDLR O-glycosylation is found N-terminal to the juxtamembrane region. Recently we identified O-glycosylation sites in the linker regions between the characteristic LDLR class A repeats in several LDLR-related receptors using the ""SimpleCell"" O-glycoproteome shotgun strategy. Herein, we have systematically characterized O-glycosylation sites on recombinant LDLR shed from HEK293 SimpleCells and CHO wild-type cells. We find that the short linker regions between LDLR class A repeats contain an evolutionarily conserved O-glycosylation site at position -1 of the first cysteine residue of most repeats, which in wild-type CHO cells is glycosylated with the typical sialylated core 1 structure. The glycosites in linker regions of LDLR class A repeats are conserved in LDLR from man to Xenopus and found in other homologous receptors. O-Glycosylation is controlled by a large family of polypeptide GalNAc transferases. Probing into which isoform(s) contributed to glycosylation of the linker regions of the LDLR class A repeats by in vitro enzyme assays suggested a major role of GalNAc-T11. This was supported by expression of LDLR in HEK293 cells, where knock-out of the GalNAc-T11 isoform resulted in the loss of glycosylation of three of four linker regions."

Gfi1b-null embryos die at midgestation very likely due to defects in erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. To analyze the full functionality of Gfi1b, we used conditionally deficient mice that harbor floxed Gfi1b alleles and inducible (Mx-Cre, Cre-ERT) or erythroid specific (EpoR-Cre) Cre expressing transgenes. In contrast to the germline knockout, EpoR-Cre mediated erythroid specific ablation of Gfi1b allows full gestation, but causes perinatal lethality with very few mice surviving to adulthood. Both the embryonic deletion of Gfi1b by EpoR-Cre and the deletion in adult mice by Mx-Cre or Cre-ERT leads to reduced numbers of erythroid precursors, perturbed and delayed erythroid maturation, anemia and extramedullary erythropoiesis. Global expression analyses showed that the Hba-x, Hbb-bh1 and Hbb-y embryonic globin genes were upregulated in Gfi1b deficient TER119+ fetal liver cells over the gestation period from day 12.5–17.5 p.c. and an increased level of Hbb-bh1 and Hbb-y embryonic globin gene expression was even maintained in adult Gfi1b deficient mice. While the expression of Bcl11a, a regulator of embryonic globin expression was not affected by Gfi1b deficiency, the expression of Gata1 was reduced and the expression of Sox6, also involved in globin switch, was almost entirely lost when Gfi1b was absent. These findings establish Gfi1b as a regulator of embryonic globin expression and embryonic and adult erythroid maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2020572230,"Activated B-Cell (ABC) Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common, aggressive and poorly chemoresponsive subtype of DLBCL, characterized by constitutive canonical NF-κB signaling. Inhibition of NF-κB signaling leads to apoptosis of ABC-DLBCL cell lines, suggesting targeted disruption of this pathway may have therapeutic relevance. The selective IKK inhibitor, NEMO Binding Domain (NBD) peptide effectively blocks constitutive NF-κB activity and induces apoptosis in ABC-DLBCL cells in vitro. Here we used a comparative approach to determine the safety and efficacy of systemic NBD peptide to inhibit constitutive NF-κB signaling in privately owned dogs with spontaneous newly diagnosed or relapsed ABC-like DLBCL. Malignant lymph nodes biopsies were taken before and twenty-four hours after peptide administration to determine biological effects. Intravenous administration of <2 mg/kg NBD peptide was safe and inhibited constitutive canonical NF-κB activity in 6/10 dogs. Reductions in mitotic index and Cyclin D expression also occurred in a subset of dogs 24 hours post peptide and in 3 dogs marked, therapeutically beneficial histopathological changes were identified. Mild, grade 1 toxicities were noted in 3 dogs at the time of peptide administration and one dog developed transient subclinical hepatopathy. Long term toxicities were not identified. Pharmacokinetic data suggested rapid uptake of peptide into tissues. No significant hematological or biochemical toxicities were identified. Overall the results from this phase I study indicate that systemic administration of NBD peptide is safe and effectively blocks constitutive NF-κB signaling and reduces malignant B cell proliferation in a subset of dogs with ABC-like DLBCL. These results have potential translational relevance for human ABC-DLBCL."

During development, Nodal depends on growth and differentiation factor (Gdf)-1 and on the shared co-receptor Cryptic to specify visceral left-right axis asymmetry. We therefore asked whether the functionality of Nodal can be augmented by Gdf1. Because Nodal and Gdf1 coimmunoprecipitate each other, they were predicted to form heterodimers, possibly to facilitate diffusion or to increase the affinity for signaling receptors. Here, we report that Gdf1 suppresses an unexpected dependence of Nodal on serum proteins and that it is critically required for non-autonomous signaling in cells expressing Cryptic.

Pluripotent stem cells hold considerable promise for regenerative medicine as their differentiation might be directed toward specific cell fates in vitro by signaling pathways that guide normal embryonic development in vivo. Endodermal progenitors that give rise to therapeutically relevant cell types such as hepatocytes or insulin-producing pancreatic β cells can be induced by Activin A. However, during normal embryogenesis, endoderm is specified by Nodal signals.

However, a recent study showed that Nodal induces endoderm progenitors that are more competent to mature into functional insulin-producing cells if it is added to cultured mouse ES cells at a 20-fold higher concentration than Activin A (9Chen A.E.

As this concentration likely exceeds physiological levels, it is important to determine how the specific activity of recombinant Nodal might be improved.

Nodal signaling in vertebrate development.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 589-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Nodal is secreted as a precursor that must be cleaved by the proprotein convertases Furin or Pace4 to remove an N-terminal prodomain. Although Nodal processing is essential to potentiate Smad signaling in cultured cells, a cleavage mutant Nodal precursor retains significant activity during gastrulation (11Beck S. Le Good J.A.

To activate Smad2/3, Nodal must also bind one of the co-receptors, Cripto or Cryptic from the EGF-CFC family of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteoglycans (14Shen M.M. Nodal signaling: developmental roles and regulation.Development. 2007; 134: 1023-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Analysis in cultured cells suggested a dual role for Cripto in concentrating the Nodal precursor in lipid rafts during processing and in stabilizing a complex of mature ligand with signaling receptors at the limiting membrane of signaling endosomes (13Blanchet M.-H.

In addition, analysis of Cripto−/− and Cryptic−/− single mutants revealed unique functions in different tissues: Cripto expression in the epiblast enables Nodal autoinduction and thereby promotes germ layer formation (14Shen M.M.

Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 597-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). By contrast, Cryptic is primarily required after gastrulation to mediate paracrine Nodal signaling from the ventral node to the left lateral plate mesoderm during left-right axis formation (19Yan Y.T.

Growth and differentiation factor (Gdf) 1 and Gdf3 barely stimulate Smad2/3 signaling except if they are coexpressed in cis together with Nodal (21Andersson O. Bertolino P. Ibáñez C.F.

Sakuma R. Nakamura T. Hamada H. Saijoh Y. Long-range action of Nodal requires interaction with GDF1.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3272-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This lack of intrinsic activity was initially attributed to inefficient precursor processing because substitution of the Gdf1 or Gdf3 prodomains by heterologous BMP prodomains facilitates the accumulation of mature ligands (21Andersson O. Bertolino P. Ibáñez C.F. Distinct and cooperative roles of mammalian Vg1 homologs GDF1 and GDF3 during early embryonic development.Dev.

Mesendoderm induction and reversal of left-right pattern by mouse Gdf1, a Vg1-related gene.Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Gdf1 stimulates the Smad3 reporter CAGA-luc independently of Nodal when overexpressed together with the proprotein convertase Furin (21Andersson O. Bertolino P. Ibáñez C.F. Distinct and cooperative roles of mammalian Vg1 homologs GDF1 and GDF3 during early embryonic development.Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, this activity was very limited. Also in conditioned medium of Xenopus oocytes where mature Gdf1 can accumulate at high levels independently of Nodal, coexpression of Nodal was still essential for signaling (22Tanaka C. Sakuma R. Nakamura T. Hamada H. Saijoh Y. Long-range action of Nodal requires interaction with GDF1.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3272-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This implies that Gdf1 and Nodal synergize by somehow promoting the bioavailability of mature ligand even after precursor cleavage. Because Gdf1 and Nodal also coimmunoprecipitated each other, the authors predicted that synergistic signaling may involve heterodimers (22Tanaka C. Sakuma R. Nakamura T. Hamada H. Saijoh Y. Long-range action of Nodal requires interaction with GDF1.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 3272-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). During development, Gdf1 primarily enables long range Nodal signaling from the midline to left lateral plate mesoderm for left-right patterning. In addition, analysis of Gdf1−/−; Gdf3−/− double mutants revealed that Gdf1 cooperates with Nodal during gastrulation to induce prechordal plate and overlying forebrain structures in a manner that appears to be redundant with the function of Gdf3 (21Andersson O. Bertolino P. Ibáñez C.F. Distinct and cooperative roles of mammalian Vg1 homologs GDF1 and GDF3 during early embryonic development.Dev. Biol. 2007; 311: 500-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Andersson O. Reissmann E. Jörnvall H. Ibáñez C.F. Synergistic interaction between Gdf1 and Nodal during anterior axis development.Dev. Biol. 2006; 293: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, the actual composition of Nodal·Gdf1 complexes and a mechanism to explain their increased activity are elusive. To address this, we analyzed the effect of Gdf1 coexpression on Nodal protein level, signal strength, and protein-protein interactions. We found that although the Gdf1 precursor must be cleaved to synergize with Nodal, proteolytic processing of Nodal is not essential. Furthermore, we report that soluble Nodal activity depends on high molecular weight serous proteins and that coexpression of Gdf1 bypasses this requirement and enables Nodal to accumulate in a low molecular weight (LMW) complex with the Nodal and Gdf1 prodomains. This LMW complex of Nodal·Gdf1 can be purified and remains active in serum-free conditions, making it attractive for cell fate-directing experiments as shown here by increased differentiation of human ES cells (hESCs) into endoderm progenitors. Full-length Nodal precursor tagged with a FLAG epitope immediately after the RQRR cleavage motif was generated by overlap extension PCR using primers that replaced the wild-type sequence AGGCAACGCCGACATCAT by the sequence CAACGTCGCGATTACAAAGACGATGACGATAAAGGACCCGGACAGGTGCAGCTGCAGCATCAT. Expression vectors for Nodal prodomain (Npro) or constitutively mature mutant form (Nmat) and cleavage-resistant Nodal precursor (Nr) have been described (26Le Good J.A. Joubin K. Giraldez A.J.

Regulation of bone morphogenetic protein activities by pro domains and proprotein convertases.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Although Nmat is FLAG-tagged at the N terminus of the mature domain, Npro and Nr carry a FLAG epitope in the prodomain after Met-45. All are in the pCS2+ backbone except Nmat, which is in pEF IRES-Puro (28Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Development of a bicistronic vector driven by the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α promoter for creation of stable mammalian cell lines that express very high levels of recombinant proteins.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). To generate Gdf1 expression vectors, an EcoRI-AgeI fragment of a mouse expressed sequence tag clone in plasmid pME18S-FL3 (Genome Systems Inc., St. Louis, MO) was cloned into pCS2+. Linkers composed of the oligonucleotides 5′-CTAGACATCATCACCATCACCACC-3′ and 5′-CTAGGGTGGTGATGGTGATGATGT-3′ encoding a His6 tag or of the oligonucleotides 5′-ATATCCATATGATGTACCAGATTACG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCGTAATCTGGTACATCATATGGATAT-3′ encoding an HA epitope were inserted between engineered NruI and AvrII sites at the N terminus of the mature domain. In a second step, inverse PCR using the primers 5′-CAGTATGGCCCCTCACAGCGGTGAA-3′ and 5′-AGCCACGACATCATCACCATCACCA-3′ followed by self-ligation added the first 4 amino acids of mature Gdf1 proximal to the His6 epitope to improve the efficiency of precursor cleavage. The expression vector pEF-Gmat for constitutively mature Gdf1 was derived using overlap extension PCR to fuse HA-tagged mature Gdf1 (primers 5′-CATCATCACCATCACCACCCTAGGGTA-3′ and 5′-TGTCACGAATTCTCAACGGCAGCCACACTC-3′) and the secretory signal sequence of Nmat (primers 5′-ATAGAAACTGGGCTTGTCGAGACAG-3′ and 5′-GTGGTGATGGTGATGATGATCGCCCCGCACAGC-3′). The fused amplicon was digested with NheI and EcoRI and cloned into pEF IRES-Puro. Gdf1 prodomain was amplified from CS-Gdf1 using the primers 5′-CTGCCTGGGGACGTCGGAGC-3′ and 5′-AATCATACTAGTTCAGCGTCGCAATCGCGGCAAG-3′, cut with EcoRI and SpeI, and inserted in pCS-Gdf1 to yield CS-Gpro. To create CS-Gr, the cleavage site of CS-Gdf1 was mutated by inverse PCR using the primers 5′-GGCCAATCCCGGCAAGGGACACAGG-3′ and 5′-GGCCACACGGAGCCCAGGGTAGA-3′ followed by self-ligation. To derive lentiviral vectors pLenti-Gdf1(HA)-puro and pLenti-Gdf1(His6)-puro, the inserts CS-Gdf1(HA) or Gdf1(His6) were subcloned into pLenti hEF1α-MCS//SV40-BsdR (pCF520) using BamHI and SpeI. To generate the Smad3 reporter pLenti-CAGA-lux-neo, a CAGA-luciferase cassette was isolated from CAGA-lux (a gift from Olov Anderson) using XmaI and XbaI and ligated into AgeI-SpeI sites of pLenti hEF1α-MCS//SV40-NeoR (pCF521). The Cripto coding sequence of pCS-Cripto was cloned into BamHI-HpaI of pCF520, giving rise to pLenti-Cripto-bsd. To derive pLenti-Cryptic-bsd, Cripto was replaced by Cryptic using BamHI and XbaI. Finally, pLenti-Rluc-puro was generated by cloning Renilla luciferase as an NheI-XbaI fragment into the XbaI site pLenti hEF1α-MCS//SV40-PuroR (pCF519). pCF519, pCF520, and pCF521 have been described earlier (29Fuerer C. Habib S.J. Nusse R. A study on the interactions between heparan sulfate proteoglycans and Wnt proteins.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 184-190PubMed Google Scholar). To generate receptor-Fc fusion constructs, a human ACVR1B cDNA fragment was amplified using primers 5′-TTTAAGCTTCCACCATGGCGGAGTCGGCCGGA-3′ and 5′-TTTGTCGACTTCCACCGGGCCCCACATGG-3′ and cloned into the pCR3-MCS-Presci-Fc vector (a gift from Pascal Schneider, Lausanne, Switzerland) using HindIII and SalI. The cDNA encoding mouse Acvr2b extracellular domain was amplified using primers 5′-TTTAAGCTTCCACCATGACGGCGCCCTGGGCGG-3′ and 5′-TTTGTCGACGGTGGGGGCTGTCGGGGGT-3′ and cloned similarly. Cripto was amplified from pIg-CriptoFc7 (a gift from Gabriella Minchiotti, Naples, Italy) using primers 5′-CACTATAGGGAGACCCAAGCTTCGAAGATGG-3′ and 5′-AATTAAGTCGACAGTGGTCGTCACAGACGG-3′ and cloned similarly. Cryptic cDNA (a gift from Gabriella Minchiotti) was amplified with 5′-CATTACACCGGTACCATGAGAGCGAACTCACCA-3′ and 5′-GAGTCAGTCGACGCTGCATTCTCTTGATCC-3′, cut with Age I (T4-blunted) and SalI, and inserted into pCR3-MCS-Presci-Fc cut with HindIII (T4-blunted) and SalI. The receptor-Fc sequences were excised from these plasmids using HindIII (T4-blunted) and XbaI (or Acc65I (T4-blunted) and XbaI in the case of Cryptic) and cloned into pEF IRES-Puro (28Hobbs S. Jitrapakdee S. Wallace J.C. Development of a bicistronic vector driven by the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α promoter for creation of stable mammalian cell lines that express very high levels of recombinant proteins.Biochem.

Acvr2 was amplified from mouse E8.5 cDNA using primers 5′-CGACGCAAGCTTACCATGGGAGCTGCTGCAAAGT-3′ and 5′-AATGTTGTCGACGGGTGGCTTCGGTGTAACAGGAT-3′, cut with HindIII and SalI, and inserted into pCR3-MCS-Presci-Fc. The fusion sequence was excised with NcoI and XbaI and transferred to the pEF IRES-Puro backbone of ACVR1B vector. The cDNA of Tgfbr2 extracellular domain was amplified from mouse E17.5 cDNA using primers 5′-AATCATGCTAGCACCATGGGTCGGGGGCTG-3′ and 5′-AATCTAGTCGACGCTGGTGGTGTATTCTTCCG-3′, cut with NheI and SalI, and inserted into pEF Acvr2a IRES-Puro cut with SalI (partially) and NheI. Bmpr2 was amplified from mouse E17.5 cDNA using primers 5′-AATCTTGCTAGCACCATGACTTCCTCGCTGCAT-3′ and 5′-ATAGATGTCGACTCGATTAAATGAATGAGGTGG-3′ and cloned like Tgfbr2. Lentiviruses were produced by transient transfection of HEK293T with a 20:13:7 mixture of lentivirus:packaging:envelope vectors. Packaging and envelope vectors were pCMVΔR8.74 and pMD2.VSVg, respectively (30Dull T. Zufferey R. Kelly M. Mandel R.J. Nguyen M. Trono D. Naldini L. A third-generation lentivirus vector with a conditional packaging system.J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8463-8471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 5 × 106 cells were seeded into a 10-cm dish and transfected on the following day with 20 μg of total DNA. The medium was replaced after 16 h and conditioned twice for 24 h. Conditioned media were pooled, filtered through a 0.45-μm polyethersulfone filter, and either used as such or centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 140 min. After centrifugation, the viral pellet was resuspended in 400 μl of PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). HEK293T and HepG2 cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen) and 1% gentamicin (Invitrogen). HEK293T cells stably expressing Nodal or its mutant derivatives from pEF IRES-Puro vectors were selected in 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) starting 1 day after transfection. To generate Gdf1 stable cells, HEK293T or Nodal-expressing cells were infected with serial dilutions of pLenti-Gdf1(HA)-puro or pLenti-Gdf1(His6)-puro lentiviruses. Selection in 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Invitrogen) was started 2 days later. Resistant cell populations selected after a multiplicity of infection of 1 were pooled. Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation experiments were done with Gdf1(HA). All activity, pulldown, and purification experiments were performed with Gdf1(His6). To create Smad3 reporter cells, HepG2 liver hepatocellular carcinoma cells were first infected with serial dilutions of pLenti-CAGA-lux-neo lentivirus and selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Sigma). Cells infected at the lowest multiplicity of infection were chosen and superinfected with either pLenti-Cripto-bsd or pLenti-Cryptic-bsd lentiviruses and selected with 10 μg/ml blasticidin S. Superinfection of these cell lines with pLenti-Rluc-puro and selection in 1 μg/ml puromycin gave rise to the reporter cell lines HepG2-Cripto·CAGA·Rluc (H-CrCR) and HepG2-CAGA·Rluc·Cryptic (H-Cryptic), respectively. Cells stably expressing Nodal and/or Gdf1 proteins were seeded in cell culture dishes containing complete medium. On the following day, medium was either left unchanged (standard conditioning in complete medium) or replaced by serum-free medium (Opti-MEM I from Invitrogen). Medium was conditioned for 3 or 4 days. After conditioning, media were collected, cleared by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 5 min, and filtered through a 0.45-μm filter (Minisart-N GF AC, Sartorius Stedim Biotech). Serum-free conditioned media were not filtered to avoid protein loss. For transient transfection (see Fig. 2C), HEK293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 105 cells/well and transfected 8 h later with a 1:1 mixture of JetPEI and Nodal- and Gdf1-expressing vectors (1 μg total) (Polyplus). Conditioned media were collected after 3 days, spun at 4000 × g for 5 min, and added onto reporter cells.FIGURE 2Nodal and Gdf1 can synergize independently of the Nodal prodomain and precursor cleavage motif.

A protocol for combined Photinus and Renilla luciferase quantification compatible with protein assays.Anal. Biochem. 2006; 356: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, reporter cells in 100 μl of medium were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 104/well. One day later, 200 μl of conditioned medium or medium containing recombinant factors was added. After overnight incubation, medium was removed, cells were lysed in 100 μl of potassium phosphate buffer with Triton X-100 for 20 min, and 5 μl was transferred to white 96-well plates (Nunc). Firefly and Renilla luciferase luminescence was revealed using a Centro LB960 luminometer (Berthold) by adding 50 μl of P/R Luc A and B reagents, respectively. Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase values. Error bars represent S.D. of triplicate values of representative experiments. To measure the activity of serum-free samples or in samples where serum had been heated or replaced by other components, reporter cells were first washed thrice and then overlaid with 100 μl of serum-free medium prior to sample addition. To determine the half-minimal effective concentration (EC50), experimental data points were fitted to a sigmoidal dose-response curve by the least square method. Calculated EC50 values were 4, 105, and 10 ng/ml for Nodal·Gdf1, rNodal, and recombinant Activin, respectively. These values were obtained from nine, six, and two biological replicates with an S.E. of 8, 11, and 11%, respectively. Western blot analysis was conducted using standard techniques. Upon addition of Laemmli buffer, samples were boiled at 95 °C for 5 min prior to loading. For detection of purified products after gel filtration, samples were concentrated 20-fold by acetone precipitation and resuspension in 2× Laemmli buffer. The antibodies used were mouse M1 anti-FLAG, rabbit anti-HA (Sigma), mouse HIS-1 (Sigma), and rabbit anti-Alix (Covalab).

A group of 53 individuals was identified who remained within the range of prehypertension during repeated measurements in a 3-year period. This group was compared with the control group of 53 normotensive subjects who were matched for age and gender. Metabolomic profiles were analyzed with UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. The prehypertensive group showed higher levels of lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) containing C14:0, C16:1, C16:0, C18:2, C18:1, C18:0, C20:5, C20:4, C20:3, and C22:6, higher circulating Lp-PLA2 activity, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), interleukin 6 (IL-6), urinary 8-epi-PGF2α, and higher brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV), before and after adjusting for BMI, WHR, smoking, alcohol consumption, serum lipid profiles, glucose, and insulin. LysoPC (16:0) was the most important plasma metabolite for evaluating the difference between control and prehypertensive groups, with a variable important in the projection (VIP) value of 17.173, and it showed a positive and independent association with DBP and SBP. In the prehypertensive group, the levels of lysoPC (16:0) positively and significantly correlated with ox-LDL, Lp-PLA2 activity, 8-epi-PGF2α, ba-PWV, and IL-6 before and after adjusting for confounding variables. Prehypertension-associated elevations in lysoPCs, Lp-PLA2 activity, ox-LDL, urinary 8-epi-PGF2α, IL-6, and ba-PWV could indicate increased oxidative stress from Lp-PLA2-catalyzed PC hydrolysis during increased LDL oxidation, thereby enhancing proinflammation and arterial stiffness."
https://openalex.org/W2050638560,"Large-scale high-throughput sequencing techniques are rapidly becoming popular methods to profile complex communities and have generated deep insights into community biodiversity. However, several technical problems, especially sequencing artifacts such as nucleotide calling errors, could artificially inflate biodiversity estimates. Sequence filtering for artifact removal is a conventional method for deleting error-prone sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. As rare species represented by low-abundance sequences in datasets may be sensitive to artifact removal process, the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery has not been well evaluated in natural complex communities. Here we employed both internal (reliable operational taxonomic units selected from communities themselves) and external (indicator species spiked into communities) references to evaluate the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery using 454 pyrosequencing of complex plankton communities collected from both freshwater and marine habitats. Multiple analyses revealed three clear patterns: 1) rare species were eliminated during sequence filtering process at all tested filtering stringencies, 2) more rare taxa were eliminated as filtering stringencies increased, and 3) elimination of rare species intensified as biomass of a species in a community was reduced. Our results suggest that cautions be applied when processing high-throughput sequencing data, especially for rare taxa detection for conservation of species at risk and for rapid response programs targeting non-indigenous species. Establishment of both internal and external references proposed here provides a practical strategy to evaluate artifact removal process."
https://openalex.org/W1967140535,"Mmt1 and Mmt2 are highly homologous yeast members of the cation diffusion facilitator transporter family localized to mitochondria. Overexpression of MMT1/2 led to changes in cellular metal homeostasis (increased iron sensitivity, decreased cobalt sensitivity, increased sensitivity to copper), oxidant generation, and increased sensitivity to H2O2. The phenotypes due to overexpression of MMT1&2 were similar to that seen in cells with deletions in MRS3 and MRS4, genes that encode the mitochondrial iron importers. Overexpression of MMT1&2 resulted in induction of the low iron transcriptional response, similar to that seen in Δmrs3Δmr4 cells. This low iron transcriptional response was suppressed by deletion of CCC1, the gene that encodes the vacuolar iron importer. Measurement of the activity of the iron-dependent gentisate 1,2-dioxygenase from Pseudaminobacter salicylatoxidans expressed in yeast cytosol, showed that changes in Mmt1/2 levels affected cytosol iron concentration even in the absence of Ccc1. Overexpression of MMT1 resulted in increased cytosolic iron whereas deletion of MMT1/MMT2 led to decreased cytosolic iron. These results support the hypothesis that Mmt1/2 function as mitochondrial iron exporters."
https://openalex.org/W2020547972,"Disgust has been implicated as a potential causal agent underlying socio-political attitudes and behaviors. Several recent studies have suggested that pathogen disgust may be a causal mechanism underlying social conservatism. However, the specificity of this effect is still in question. The present study tested the effects of disgust on a range of policy preferences to clarify whether disgust is generally implicated in political conservatism across public policy attitudes or is uniquely related to specific content domains. Self-reported socio-political attitudes were compared between participants in two experimental conditions: 1) an odorless control condition, and 2) a disgusting odor condition. In keeping with previous research, the present study showed that exposure to a disgusting odor increased endorsement of socially conservative attitudes related to sexuality. In particular, there was a strong and consistent link between induced disgust and less support for gay marriage."
https://openalex.org/W2029294641,"The clinical outcome of Helicobacter pylori infections is determined by multiple host-pathogen interactions that may develop to chronic gastritis, and sometimes peptic ulcers or gastric cancer. Highly virulent strains encode a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that delivers the effector protein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. Translocated CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation at EPIYA-sequence motifs, called A, B and C in Western-type strains, by members of the oncogenic Src and Abl host kinases. Phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs mediate interactions of CagA with host signaling factors – in particular various SH2-domain containing human proteins – thereby hijacking multiple downstream signaling cascades. Observations of tyrosine-phosphorylated CagA are mainly based on the use of commercial phosphotyrosine antibodies, which originally were selected to detect phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins. Systematic studies of phosphorylated EPIYA-motif detection by the different antibodies would be very useful, but are not yet available. To address this issue, we synthesized phospho- and non-phosphopeptides representing each predominant Western CagA EPIYA-motif, and determined the recognition patterns of seven different phosphotyrosine antibodies in Western blots, and also performed infection studies with diverse representative Western H. pylori strains. Our results show that a total of 9–11 amino acids containing the phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs are necessary and sufficient for specific detection by these antibodies, but revealed great variability in sequence recognition. Three of the antibodies recognized phosphorylated EPIYA-motifs A, B and C similarly well; whereas preferential binding to phosphorylated motif A and motifs A and C was found with two and one antibodies, respectively, and the seventh anti-phosphotyrosine antibody did not recognize any phosphorylated EPIYA-motif. Controls showed that none of the antibodies recognized the corresponding non-phospho CagA peptides, and that all of them recognized phosphotyrosines in mammalian proteins. These data are valuable in judicious application of commercial anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies and in characterization of CagA phosphorylation during infection and disease development."
https://openalex.org/W2087820094,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) is a master regulator that coordinates chaperone protein expression to enhance cellular survival in the face of heat stress. In cancer cells, HSF1 drives a transcriptional program distinct from heat shock to promote metastasis and cell survival. Its strong association with the malignant phenotype implies that HSF1 antagonists may have general and effective utilities in cancer therapy. For this purpose, we had identified an avid RNA aptamer for HSF1 that is portable among different model organisms. Extending our previous work in yeast and Drosophila, here we report the activity of this aptamer in human cancer cell lines. When delivered into cells using a synthetic gene and strong promoter, this aptamer was able to prevent HSF1 from binding to its DNA regulation elements. At the cellular level, expression of this aptamer induced apoptosis and abolished the colony-forming capability of cancer cells. At the molecular level, it reduced chaperones and attenuated the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Collectively, these data demonstrate the advantage of aptamers in drug target validation and support the hypothesis that HSF1 DNA binding activity is a potential target for controlling oncogenic transformation and neoplastic growth."

In the anti-ulcer study, rats were divided into six groups. Group 1 and group 2 received 10% Tween 20 (vehicle). Group 3 received 20 mg/kg Omeprazole. Groups 4, 5 and 6 received ETHAB at doses of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg, respectively. After an hour, group 1 received the vehicle. Groups 2-6 received absolute ethanol to induce gastric mucosal lesions. In the WRL68 cell line, an IC50 of more than 100 µg/mL was observed. ETHAB results showed antioxidant activity in the DPPH, FRAP, nitric oxide and metal chelating assays. There was no acute toxicity even at the highest dosage (1000 mg/kg). Microscopy showed that rats pretreated with ETHAB revealed protection of gastric mucosa as ascertained by significant increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD), pH level, mucus secretion, reduced gastric lesions, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and remarkable flattened gastric mucosa. Histologically, pretreatment with ETHAB resulted in comparatively better gastric protection, due to reduction of submucosal edema with leucocyte infiltration. PAS staining showed increased intensity in uptake of Alcian blue. In terms of immunohistochemistry, ETHAB showed down-expression of Bax proteins and over-expression of Hsp70 proteins.The gastroprotective effect of ETHAB may be attributed to antioxidant activity, increased gastric wall mucus, pH level of gastric contents, SOD activity, decrease in MDA level, ulcer area, flattening of gastric mucosa, reduction of edema and leucocyte infiltration of the submucosal layer, increased PAS staining, up-regulation of Hsp70 protein and suppressed expression of Bax."
https://openalex.org/W2032223268,"Depressive symptoms have been shown to independently affect both antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and HIV clinical outcomes in high-income countries. We examined the prospective relationship between depressive symptoms and adherence, virologic failure, and suppressed immune function in people living with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania. Data from 403 study participants who were on stable ART and engaged in HIV clinical care were analyzed. We assessed crude and adjusted associations of depressive symptoms and ART adherence, both at baseline and at 12 months, using logistic regression. We used logistic generalized estimating equations to assess the association and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between depressive symptoms and both virologic failure and suppressed immune function. Ten percent of participants reported moderate or severe depressive symptoms at baseline and 31% of participants experienced virologic failure (>150 copies/ml) over two years. Depressive symptoms were associated with greater odds of reported medication nonadherence at both baseline (Odds Ratio [OR] per 1-unit increase = 1.18, 95% CI [1.12, 1.24]) and 12 months (OR = 1.08, 95% CI [1.03, 1.14]). By contrast, increases in depressive symptom score were inversely related to both virologic failure (OR = 0.93, 95% CI [0.87, 1.00]) and immune system suppression (OR = 0.88, 95% CI [0.79, 0.99]), though the association between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes was less precise than for the association with nonadherence. Findings indicate a positive association between depressive symptoms and nonadherence, and also an inverse relationship between depressive symptoms and clinical outcomes, possibly due to informative loss to follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W2032987213,"Accumulating evidences have demonstrated that nuclear factor κB/p65 plays a protective role in the protection of ischemic preconditioning and detrimental role in lethal ischemia-induced programmed cell death including apoptosis and autophagic death. However, its role in the protection of ischemic postconditioning is still unclear.Rat MCAO model was used to produce transient focal ischemia. The procedure of ischemic postconditioning consisted of three cycles of 30 seconds reperfusion/reocclusion of MCA. The volume of cerebral infarction was measured by TTC staining and neuronal apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Western blotting was used to analyze the changes in protein levels of Caspase-3, NF-κB/p65, phosphor- NF-κB/p65, IκBα, phosphor- IκBα, Noxa, Bim and Bax between rats treated with and without ischemic postconditioning. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to examine the distribution of NF-κB/p65 and Noxa.Ischemic postconditioning made transient focal ischemia-induced infarct volume decrease obviously from 38.6% ± 5.8% to 23.5% ± 4.3%, and apoptosis rate reduce significantly from 46.5% ± 6.2 to 29.6% ± 5.3% at reperfusion 24 h following 2 h focal cerebral ischemia. Western blotting analysis showed that ischemic postconditioning suppressed markedly the reduction of NF-κB/p65 in cytoplasm, but elevated its content in nucleus either at reperfusion 6 h or 24 h. Moreover, the decrease of IκBα and the increase of phosphorylated IκBα and phosphorylated NF-κB/p65 at indicated reperfusion time were reversed by ischemic postconditioning. Correspondingly, proapoptotic proteins Caspase-3, cleaved Caspase-3, Noxa, Bim and Bax were all mitigated significantly by ischemic postconditioning. Confocal microscopy revealed that ischemic postconditioning not only attenuated ischemia-induced translocation of NF-κB/p65 from neuronal cytoplasm to nucleus, but also inhibited the abnormal expression of proapoptotic protein Noxa within neurons.We demonstrated in this study that the protection of ischemic postconditioning on neuronal apoptosis caused by transient focal ischemia is associated with attenuation of the activation of NF-κB/p65 in neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2019741974,"In bacteria, stop codons are recognized by two similar class 1 release factors, release factor 1 (RF1) and release factor 2 (RF2).

Protein synthesis on the ribosome terminates when one of the three stop codons UAA, UGA, or UAG enters the decoding center of the small subunit.

RF3 is the bacterial class 2 RF. Like its eukaryotic and archaeal counterparts, RF3 is a GTPase, but appears to fulfill a distinct function in bacteria relative to the other two kingdoms (16Margus T. Remm M. Tenson T. Phylogenetic distribution of translational GTPases in bacteria.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Whereas early studies hinted at an integral role for RF3 during the catalysis of peptide release (17Capecchi M.R. Klein H.A.

Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M.

RF3 uses the energy from GTP hydrolysis to accelerate the dissociation of the class I RFs following peptide release but has no effect on the maximal rate (kcat) of release (4Koutmou K.S.

In addition to their function in canonical release, both classes of RF are involved in a post peptidyl transfer quality control (post PT QC) mechanism (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). During post PT QC, a misincorporation event that results in a mismatched tRNA/mRNA interaction in the P site of the ribosome leads to substantial losses in fidelity for subsequent decoding steps. These mismatched complexes are ultimately recognized by release factors and protein synthesis terminates prematurely. Interestingly, whereas RF3 does not affect the rate of release by class I RFs on stop codons (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), it significantly accelerates the rate of premature release by RF2 on mismatched complexes (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We note that RF1 was not tested extensively for a role in post PT QC in these early studies. In vivo experiments nicely support the biochemistry and establish a role for RF3 in fidelity during translation (22Zaher H.S. Green R. A primary role for release factor 3 in quality control during translation elongation in Escherichia coli.Cell. 2011; 147: 396-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar): deletion of RF3 has profound effects on premature termination and gene expression especially in error-prone backgrounds. Interestingly, RF3 is nonessential and is only found in a subset of bacteria (16Margus T. Remm M. Tenson T. Phylogenetic distribution of translational GTPases in bacteria.BMC Genomics. 2007; 8: 15Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), consistent with the idea that its primary function is in quality control rather than normal termination. Here we sought to clarify the involvement of the RFs in these various processes using a well defined in vitro system. We show that whereas RF1 and RF2 display similar behaviors during canonical stop codon recognition, RF2 appears to be more efficient and broadly competent at promoting termination on mismatched complexes (post PT QC). These data suggest that RF2, in addition to its participation in canonical release, functions as a specialized quality control factor with RF3.

We first established that RF1 and RF2 behave similarly during canonical termination in our in vitro system as reported previously (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Ribosomal nascent chain complexes (RNCs) programmed with an mRNA encoding Met-Lys-Stop (MKX) and carrying fMet-Lys-tRNALys in the P site (Fig. 1A) were generated and reacted with excess RF1/RF2 in the absence or presence of RF3 and GTP. As anticipated (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we observed essentially no change in the kcat of release when RF3 was added to the reaction (Fig. 1B). We next evaluated the effects of RF3 on a multiple turnover release reaction where RF3 is thought to accelerate the rate of dissociation of RF1/RF2 (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R.

RF1 and RF2 (3 nm) were provided in substoichiometric amounts relative to RNC (25 nm). In the absence of RF3, apparent rates of release of 0.0011 s−1 and 0.0041 s−1 were measured for RF1 and RF2, respectively. The addition of RF3-GTP accelerated the apparent rates of release for both factors (∼10-fold for RF1 and ∼5-fold for RF2) (Fig. 1C and Table 1), as observed previously (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R. RF3:GTP promotes rapid dissociation of the class 1 termination factor.RNA. 2014; 20: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y.

We note that the rates of release under these multiple-turnover conditions (in the presence of RF3) are much slower than the single-turnover rates, suggesting that under these conditions, dissociation of RF1 and RF2 is rate-limiting.TABLE 1Apparent rates of release for various complexesComplexA site codonRF1RF2−RF3+RF3−RF3+RF3kappEnd pointkappEnd pointkappEnd pointkappEnd points−1s−1s−1s−1MKX (excess)UAA0.085 ± 0.00800.76 ± 0.0220.14 ± 0.0300.80 ± 0.0440.088 ± 0.0210.74 ± 0.0610.085 ± 0.0110.80 ± 0.032MKX (substoich.)UAA0.0011 ± 0.000240.81 ± 0.0910.0091 ± 0.00170.70 ± 0.0350.0040 ± 0.00030.74 ± 0.0200.017 ± 0.00240.73 ± 0.027MKFUUUNDaND indicates the rates were immeasurably slow.NDNDNDNDND0.0024 ± 0.000330.30 ± 0.016MNFUUUNDNDNDND0.0022 ± 0.000210.79 ± 0.0250.015 ± 0.00140.79 ± 0.019MKIAUCNDNDNDNDNDND0.0021 ± 0.000480.32 ± 0.027MNIAUC0.0038 ± 0.000360.9668 ± 0.0310.015 ± 0.00200.42 ± 0.0180.0027 ± 0.000350.93 ± 0.0420.018 ± 0.00220.92 ± 0.029MKDGAUNDNDNDNDNDND0.00040 ± 0.000150.69 ± 0.19MNDGAU0.00046 ± 0.000270.92 ± 0.380.0030 ± 0.000340.18 ± 0.00730.0055 ± 0.00140.77 ± 0.0560.019 ± 0.00250.99 ± 0.043MKGGGCNDND0.00077 ± 0.0000750.38 ± 0.26NDND0.00086 ± 0.000610.81 ± 0.15MNGGGCNDND0.0089 ± 0.00400.50 ± 0.160.0054 ± 0.00170.70 ± 0.0490.019 ± 0.00600.73 ± 0.10MKPCCGNDND0.0028 ± 0.000860.39 ± 0.14NDND0.0059 ± 0.00260.67 ± 0.075MNPCCGNDND0.0024 ± 0.000260.53 ± 0.0150.00063 ± 0.00023∼10.035 ± 0.010.67 ± 0.07MKVGUGNDND0.00060 ± 0.000270.60 ± 0.092NDND0.00088 ± 0.0004∼1MNVGUGNDND0.0027 ± 0.00150.67 ± 0.180.0015 ± 0.000420.71 ± 0.0920.036 ± 0.0100.80 ± 0.095MKAGCCNDND0.0021 ± 0.00400.50 ± 0.16NDND0.0021 ± 0.00200.47 ± 0.64MNAGCCNDND0.0038 ± 0.00230.47 ± 0.0390.0028 ± 0.001040.77 ± 0.140.020 ± 0.00100.79 ± 0.077MKLUUGbUUG is a near-stop codon for RF1.0.0030 ± 0.000520.97 ± 0.160.012 ± 0.0040.89 ± 0.056NDND0.0010 ± 0.00250.40 ± 0.05MNLUUGbUUG is a near-stop codon for RF1.0.0029 ± 0.0020.74 ± 0.240.010 ± 0.00380.49 ± 0.0020.0015 ± 0.000760.89 ± 0.060.010 ± 0.0050.82 ± 0.05MKYUACcUAC is a near-stop codon for RF1 and RF2.0.0043 ± 0.000260.71 ± 0.0110.017 ± 0.000770.69 ± 0.00730.0019 ± 0.000280.70 ± 0.0380.0051 ± 0.000510.66 ± 0.019a ND indicates the rates were immeasurably slow.b UUG is a near-stop codon for RF1.c UAC is a near-stop codon for RF1 and RF2. Open table in a new tab Having established that both factors behave equivalently in our reconstituted systems during canonical termination, we next determined the release activity of RF1 and RF2 on mismatched complexes. We prepared matched and mismatched dipeptidyl-tRNA complexes as described earlier (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar); for example, a mismatched complex was generated by forcing Lys-tRNALys to decode the near cognate asparagine AAU codon (Fig. 2A), and a phenylalanine codon (UUU) was positioned in the A site. These complexes were reacted with 10 μm RF1 and RF2 in the absence or the presence of 15 μm RF3 and 2 mm GTP. As reported previously (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 28Jørgensen F. Adamski F.M. Tate W.P. Kurland C.G. Release factor-dependent false stops are infrequent in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), RF1 did not promote release (hydrolysis) of the dipeptide product from the dipeptidyl-tRNA on the matched MKF complex, even in the presence of RF3 (Fig. 2B, left). However, whereas RF2 on its own also failed to promote hydrolysis on the matched complex, the addition of RF3 resulted in observable hydrolysis (Fig. 2B, right, filled symbols). These data hint at a difference in the biochemical behaviors of RF1 and RF2. We next evaluated release activity on the mismatched RNCs. As reported previously (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), RF2 promotes release on the mismatched MNF complex, and RF3 increases the rate of this reaction by almost an order of magnitude (Fig. 2B, right, open symbols). Interestingly, RF1 failed to promote release on the mismatched MNF complex, and even the addition of RF3 had no effect (Fig. 2B, left). These data were somewhat surprising as we had earlier observed that RF1 could promote termination on certain mismatched RNCs (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that premature termination by RF1 (and not RF2) may be codon-dependent, perhaps a consequence of distinct motifs in the stop codon-recognizing domain 2 of the two factors (5Ito K. Uno M. Nakamura Y. A tripeptide “anticodon” deciphers stop codons in messenger RNA.Nature. 2000; 403: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To further explore the involvement of RF1 in post PT QC, we prepared a series of RNCs with different sense codons positioned in the A site. RNCs with an isoleucine codon (AUC) in the A site were reacted with RF1 and RF2 in the absence and the presence of RF3 (Fig. 2C). As expected, neither RF1 nor RF2 promoted substantial release on the matched MKI complex, although RF3 did modestly stimulate release by RF2 on this complex (Fig. 2D, right, filled symbols). On the mismatched MNI complex, RF1 only appeared to promote release of the dipeptide with a rate similar to that observed for RF2 (Fig. 2D, open circles, and Table 1). Interestingly, however, whereas the addition of RF3 resulted in an increase in RF2-mediated release, the addition of RF3 to the RF1 reaction resulted in a reproducible drop in its end point (Fig. 2D). We next prepared another pair of matched and mismatched complexes with a glutamate codon (GAU) positioned in the A site (MKD and MND, respectively) (Fig. 2E). Again, neither RF1 nor RF2 promoted release on the matched MKD complex, and the addition of RF3 had modest effects only on the RF2-mediated reaction (Fig. 2F, right, filled symbols). For the mismatched MND complex, RF1 stimulated the rate of release only modestly relative to the matched complex, and as observed with the MNI complex, the addition of RF3 diminished the end point of this reaction (Fig. 2F, left, open symbols). By contrast, RF2-mediated release on this mismatched complex (MND) was substantial and the addition of RF3 further increased this rate (Fig. 2F, right, open symbols). These data, together with those presented in Fig. 2B, suggest that the interaction of RF1 with mismatched complexes has a strong dependence on the A site codon. To provide further support for this hypothesis, we prepared five new pairs of matched and mismatched complexes displaying various A site codons that included a glycine GGC codon, a proline CCG codon, a valine GUG codon, an alanine GCC codon, and a leucine UUG codon (Table 1). Except for the UUG complex, which displays a near-stop codon for RF1, all matched complexes failed to react with either factor. Moreover, as seen earlier, the addition of RF3 had only modest effects on premature termination on these complexes. As seen in the MNF and MND complexes (above), RF1 alone did not promote release on mismatched complexes, and the addition of RF3 only slightly stimulated the rate of release as compared with those measured on matched complexes; additionally, these reactions exhibited end point defects (Table 1). RF2, however, displayed robust release activity on all mismatched complexes, and the addition of RF3 increased the rate of premature termination to levels comparable with those observed on authentic termination complexes (Table 1). These observations suggest that RF2 is principally involved in the recognition of mismatched complexes, highlighting a distinct role for this factor during post PT QC. The observed decreases in end point triggered by RF3 on the RF1-mediated termination reactions (for the MNI and MND mismatched complexes) suggest the possibility of an RF3-dependent induction of a competing process. RF3 has previously been shown to stimulate the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from ribosomal complexes (29Heurgué-Hamard V. Karimi R. Mora L. MacDougall J. Leboeuf C. Grentzmann G. Ehrenberg M. Buckingham R.H. Ribosome release factor RF4 and termination factor RF3 are involved in dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 808-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a phenomenon that could readily explain the observed end point defects. We asked whether RF3 promotes peptidyl-tRNA dissociation from mismatched complexes by utilizing peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase to determine the amount of nonribosome bound peptidyl-tRNA in the various reactions (26Shoemaker C.J. Eyler D.E. Green R. Dom34:Hbs1 promotes subunit dissociation and peptidyl-tRNA drop-off to initiate no-go decay.Science. 2010; 330: 369-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mismatched MND complex was incubated in the presence of RF1 in the absence or presence of peptidyl-hydrolyase. The fraction of released product observed in the absence of peptidyl-hydrolyase was subtracted from that observed in the presence of peptidyl-hydrolyase to correct for the release activity by RFs. Indeed, we see that RF1 on its own promotes the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the mismatched MND complex (Fig. 3). Moreover, when the release activity of RF1 is eliminated (through the use of a catalytically dead GAQ variant), the peptidyl-tRNA dissociation reaction proceeds even more efficiently (Fig. 3). The addition of RF3 was found to accelerate the rate of peptidyl-tRNA dissociation (by ∼4-fold) such that the reaction proceeded nearly to completion (Fig. 3, left). As seen earlier (21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), we observed little to no peptidyl-tRNA dissociation in the presence of RF2 (Fig. 4A, right).FIGURE 4RF2 associates stably with near-stop complexes. A, time courses of peptide release on the near-stop codon UAC in the presence of saturating amounts of RF1 and RF2, respectively.

The pellet indicates the sample following centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. Both RFs associate stably with the stop codon complex (MKX), but only RF2 was observed to associate with the near-stop codon complex (MKY).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In light of differences that we observed between RF1 and RF2 during post PT QC, we next characterized the binding interactions between the RFs and various ribosomal complexes. For this experiment, matched stop codon (UAA) complexes were prepared as earlier (MKX, Fig. 1A) as well as matched near-stop codon complexes with UAC (tyrosine) positioned in the A site. The reactivity of the complexes with the RFs was first tested. As seen previously (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), RF1 and RF2 catalyzed the release reaction 10-fold more rapidly on the stop than on the near-stop complex, although both reactions proceeded to completion (Fig. 4A and Table 1). Furthermore, as reported earlier (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the addition of RF3 increased the rate of release by ∼4-fold on the near-stop complex. To assess the binding interaction between the RFs and the RNCs qualitatively, we utilized a pelleting assay (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R. RF3:GTP promotes rapid dissociation of the class 1 termination factor.RNA. 2014; 20: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 30Tate W. Greuer B. Brimacombe R. Codon recognition in polypeptide chain termination: site directed crosslinking of termination codon to Escherichia coli release factor 2.Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 6537-6544Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, RNCs were incubated with His-tagged RF, and the complexes were pelleted over a sucrose cushion. The fraction of ribosome-bound RF was determined using Western analysis (with anti-His antibody) where input was compared with the pelleted sample. As anticipated, both factors were found to associate quantitatively with the authentic stop codon complex. However, whereas RF1 failed to associate with the near-stop codon complex, RF2 was observed to associate strongly with this complex (Fig. 4B). We next evaluated the importance of RF3-mediated GTP hydrolysis for its role in post PT QC. We found that inhibition of GTP hydrolysis through the addition of the nonhydrolyzable analog GDP-PNP had little to no effect on the rates of RF3-mediated recycling of RF1 and RF2 in the multiple turnover reaction (Fig. 5A and data not shown). This acceleration of the apparent rates (5-fold) is comparable with the stimulation seen in the presence of GTP (4-fold) (Fig. 1B). These data support a model put forward by Ehrenberg and colleagues (31Zavialov A.V. Mora L. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Release of peptide promoted by the GGQ motif of class 1 release factors regulates the GTPase activity of RF3.Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 789-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and recent data (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R. RF3:GTP promotes rapid dissociation of the class 1 termination factor.RNA. 2014; 20: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) arguing that GTP hydrolysis is not required for displacement of the RFs by RF3. We next evaluated the dependence on GTP hydrolysis of RF3-mediated stimulation of premature termination by RF2 (when RF3 is in excess relative to ribosome complexes). Again, we found the rates of this reaction to be dependent on the presence of GTP but not on its hydrolysis. In the presence of GDP, the rate of premature termination was almost identical to that measured in the absence of RF3 (Fig. 5B), whereas in the presence of the nonhydrolyzable analog GDP-PNP or GTP, the addition of RF3 increased the rate of premature termination 10-fold (Fig. 5B). Biochemical characterization of the bacterial release factors RF1 and RF2 during canonical termination and quality control (post PT QC) has revealed unexpected differences between the two factors. During canonical stop codon recognition, the factors appear to behave very similarly. Both factors promote release with a maximal rate that does not change with the addition of RF3, consistent with earlier observations (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R. RF3:GTP promotes rapid dissociation of the class 1 termination factor.RNA. 2014; 20: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21Zaher H.S. Green R. Quality control by the ribosome following peptide bond formation.Nature. 2009; 457: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the addition of RF3 was found to promote the dissociation of both factors following peptide release on stop codons with nearly equivalent rates in our recycling assays (Fig. 1C). Consistent with these similarities and earlier reports (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), both RF1 and RF2 appear to achieve their accuracy primarily by utilizing differences in rate constants for release on stop codon and near-stop codon complexes. The addition of RF3 to termination reactions appears to have a slightly adverse effect on accuracy on so-called matched complexes (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 4), for which the rate of premature termination was measured to be 2–4-fold higher in the presence of RF3. In contrast to these observations, during mismatched complex recognition the factors appear to behave distinctly. RF2 effectively acted on all tested mismatched complexes, and the addition of RF3 increased the rate of premature termination by nearly an order of magnitude (Fig. 2). However, RF1 effectively recognized only a subset of mismatched complexes, and the addition of RF3 tended to decrease the rate of premature termination (and increase the rate of peptidyl-tRNA dissociation) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). These observations highlight a profound distinction between RF1 and RF2 during noncanonical termination, for which our data suggest that in addition to its primary role in canonical termination, RF2 plays a key role in post PT QC. Similar to RF3-dependent dissociation of RFs during canonical release (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R. RF3:GTP promotes rapid dissociation of the class 1 termination factor.RNA. 2014; 20: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 20Freistroffer D.V. Pavlov M.Y. MacDougall J. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. Release factor RF3 in E. coli accelerates the dissociation of release factors RF1 and RF2 from the ribosome in a GTP-dependent manner.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4126-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), RF3-dependent acceleration of premature termination by RF2 or peptidyl-tRNA dissociation is dependent on the presence of GTP but not its hydrolysis (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 5). These observations reinforce recent reports demonstrating that only GTP-bound RF3 binds the ribosome (4Koutmou K.S. McDonald M.E. Brunelle J.L. Green R. RF3:GTP promotes rapid dissociation of the class 1 termination factor.RNA. 2014; 20: 609-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our data suggest that after this initial binding event, downstream events diverge as function of the status of the ribosomal complex and the identity of the release factor. In particular, when there is a deacylated P site tRNA, i.e. following canonical release, RF3 facilitates dissociation of the class 1 RF, independent of its identity. In the presence of a peptidyl-tRNA bound in the P site in the context of a matched complex with a near-stop codon in the A site, RF3 again accelerates the rate of premature termination independent of the identity of the class 1 RF. However, in the presence of a mismatched complex, RF3 appears to interact differently with RF1 and RF2; the downstream outcome is premature termination with RF2 and peptidyl-tRNA dissociation with RF1. Attempts to understand the structural/sequence elements that distinguish the two factors during post PT QC proved to be difficult. Specifically, our efforts to introduce RF2 domains into RF1 did not change the behavior of this factor in premature termination (data not shown). Further structural and biochemical studies are likely to illuminate these differences and how they facilitate the dominant role of RF2 in quality control. The identification of specificity differences between RF1 and RF2 are not without precedent. Previous reports indicated that certain ribosomal mutations have differential effects on termination by RF1 and RF2 (32Ortiz-Meoz R.F. Green R. Helix 69 is key for uniformity during substrate selection on the ribosome.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 25604-25610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar); mutations in helix 69 of the large subunit inhibited RF2-mediated release on UGA codons but not RF1-mediated release on UAA and UAG. Further support for these ideas comes from an earlier report showing that RF1 and RF2 utilize different strategies to achieve accuracy during termination (13Freistroffer D.V. Kwiatkowski M. Buckingham R.H. Ehrenberg M. The accuracy of codon recognition by polypeptide release factors.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 2046-2051Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); RF2 utilizes kinetic discrimination whereas RF1 utilizes thermodynamic discrimination. More specifically, the Km differences between stop codon and near-stop codons are smaller for RF2 relative to RF1; in contrast, the kcat differences are higher for RF2 relative to RF1. These observations suggest that RF2 is more likely to interact with noncanonical termination complexes, but under normal conditions, this interaction is unproductive. We reason that the addition of RF3 induces a conformational change on RF2 that increases the likelihood of a productive interaction forming between RF2 and the ribosome. Consistent with these ideas, we found that RF2 has higher affinity for near-stop complexes than RF1 (Fig. 4). Our data are also consistent with studies indicating that RF2 functions in a different quality control process, during which it works cooperatively with the bacterial factor ArfA to rescue stalled ribosomes (33Shimizu Y. ArfA recruits RF2 into stalled ribosomes.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 423: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 34Chadani Y. Ito K. Kutsukake K. Abo T. ArfA recruits release factor 2 to rescue stalled ribosomes by peptidyl-tRNA hydrolysis in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2012; 86: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We note that RF1 is nonessential for E. coli, admittedly after some engineering, even in the presence of the ∼200 amber (UAG) codons in the genome of the bacterium (35Johnson D.B. Xu J. Shen Z. Takimoto J.K. Schultz M.D. Schmitz R.J. Xiang Z. Ecker J.R. Briggs S.P. Wang L. RF1 knockout allows ribosomal incorporation of unnatural amino acids at multiple sites.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Further studies are likely to illuminate the complexities of the roles of these various factors in ribosome function and rescue. It is interesting to note that despite fundamental differences between bacterial and eukaryotic termination, quality control processes in both domains of life have evolved to utilize release factors themselves, or RF-like proteins, for quality control. In eukaryotes, for example, multiple mRNA surveillance pathways depend on the eRF1- and eRF3-related factors Dom34 and Hbs1 for ribosome rescue (36Graille M. Chaillet M. van Tilbeurgh H. Structure of yeast Dom34: a protein related to translation termination factor eRF1 and involved in No-Go decay.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7145-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rationally, for all of these processes, the signals for crisis and rescue must originate in the decoding center of the ribosome where decisions of this nature are made.

Yet, there is still a need for methods that allow for enrichment and isolation of modified cells for genetic studies and therapeutics based on gene modified human cells. We have developed and validated two methods for simple enrichment and isolation of single or multiplex gene KO's in transformed, immortalized, and human progenitor cells. These methods rely on selection of a phenotypic change such as resistance to a particular drug or ability to grow in a selective environment. The first method, termed co-transposition, utilizes integration of a piggyBac transposon vector encoding a drug resistance gene. The second method, termed co-targeting, utilizes TALENs to KO any gene that when lost induces a selectable phenotype. Using these methods we also show removal of entire genes and demonstrate that TALENs function in human CD34+ progenitor cells. Further, co-transposition can be used to generate conditional KO cell lines utilizing an inducible cDNA rescue transposon vector. These methods allow for robust enrichment and isolation of KO cells in a rapid and efficient manner."

Materials and Methods Nanobubbles carrying AR siRNA were prepared using poly-L-lysine and electrostatic adsorption methods. Using C4-2 cell activity as a testing index, the optimal irradiation parameters (including the nanobubble number/cell number ratio, mechanical index [MI], and irradiation time) were determined and used for transfection of three human prostate cancer cell lines (C4-2, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells). The AR expression levels were investigated with RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Additionally, the effects of the nanobubbles and control microbubbles named SonoVue were assessed via imaging in a C4-2 xenograft model. Finally, the growth and AR expression of seven groups of tumor tissues were assessed using the C4-2 xenograft mouse model. Results The nanobubbles had an average diameter of 609.5±15.6 nm and could effectively bind to AR siRNA. Under the optimized conditions of a nanobubble number/cell number ratio of 100∶1, an MI of 1.2, and an irradiation time of 2 min, the highest transfection rates in C4-2, LNCaP, and PC-3 cells were 67.4%, 74.0%, and 63.96%, respectively. In the C4-2 and LNCaP cells, treatment with these binding nanobubbles plus ultrasonic irradiation significantly inhibited cell growth and resulted in the suppression of AR mRNA and protein expression. Additionally, contrast-enhanced ultrasound showed that the nanobubbles achieved stronger signals than the SonoVue control in the central hypovascular area of the tumors. Finally, the anti-tumor effect of these nanobubbles plus ultrasonic irradiation was most significant in the xenograft tumor model compared with the other groups. Conclusion Nanobubbles carrying AR siRNA could be potentially used as gene vectors in combination with ultrasonic irradiation for the treatment of AIPC."
https://openalex.org/W2056363296,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a prevalent vascular disease that can progressively enlarge and rupture with a high rate of mortality. Inflammation and active remodeling of the aortic wall have been suggested to be critical in its pathogenesis. Meanwhile, ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are known to reduce cardiovascular events, but its role in AAA management remains unclear. Here, we show that EPA can attenuate murine CaCl2-induced AAA formation. Aortas from BALB/c mice fed an EPA-diet appeared less inflamed, were significantly smaller in diameter compared to those from control-diet-fed mice, and had relative preservation of aortic elastic lamina. Interestingly, CT imaging also revealed markedly reduced calcification of the aortas after EPA treatment. Mechanistically, MMP2, MMP9, and TNFSF11 levels in the aortas were reduced after EPA treatment. Consistent with this finding, RAW264.7 macrophages treated with EPA showed attenuated Mmp9 levels after TNF-α simulation. These results demonstrate a novel role of EPA in attenuating AAA formation via the suppression of critical remodeling pathways in the pathogenesis of AAAs, and raise the possibility of using EPA for AAA prevention in the clinical setting."
https://openalex.org/W2093080107,"Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva is characterized by extensive ossification within muscle tissues, and its molecular pathogenesis is responsible for the constitutively activating mutation (R206H) of the bone morphogenetic protein type 1 receptor, activin-like kinase 2 (ALK2). In this study, we investigated the effects of implanting ALK2 (R206H)-transfected myoblastic C2C12 cells into nude mice on osteoclast formation during heterotopic ossification in muscle and subcutaneous tissues. The implantation of ALK2 (R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells with BMP-2 in nude mice induced robust heterotopic ossification with an increase in the formation of osteoclasts in muscle tissues but not in subcutaneous tissues. The implantation of ALK2 (R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells in muscle induced heterotopic ossification more effectively than that of empty vector-transfected cells. A co-culture of ALK2 (R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells as well as the conditioned medium from ALK2 (R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells enhanced osteoclast formation in Raw264.7 cells more effectively than those with empty vector-transfected cells. The transfection of ALK2 (R206H) into C2C12 cells elevated the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, whereas the inhibition of TGF-β signaling suppressed the enhanced formation of osteoclasts in the co-culture with ALK2 (R206H)-transfected C2C12 cells and their conditioned medium. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the causal mutation transfection of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva in myoblasts enhanced the formation of osteoclasts from its precursor through TGF-β in muscle tissues."

To execute these reactions, Top1 and Top1mt introduce DNA single-strand breaks through their catalytic tyrosine residues, which remain transiently covalently bound to the 3′-end of the nicks. These catalytic intermediates are referred to as Top1 cleavage complexes (Top1cc). They are normally transient as the 5′-hydroxyl DNA ends quickly religate the nicks by attacking the 3′-tyrosyl-DNA bonds. Camptothecin (CPT) or its clinical derivatives topotecan and irinotecan, as well as the noncamptothecin indenoisoquinolines, trap Top1cc by binding at the Top1-DNA interface with high selectivity, thereby inhibiting the DNA religation step (4Hsiang Y.H.

Studies in yeast have shown that, even in the absence of CPT, substitution of conserved residues in the active site of Top1 alter the catalytic cycle of the enzyme. Substitution of Thr722 with Ala (T722A) produces a CPT-mimetic effect, enhancing the stability of Top1cc by reducing DNA religation (inhibiting the reverse reaction) (9Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

The main function of Top1mt is likely to remove topological stress from mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). mtDNA is a circular multicopy genome that encodes 13 essential subunits of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, two ribosomal RNAs (12S and 16S) and 22 tRNAs (14Anderson S. Bankier A.T. Barrell B.G. de Bruijn M.H. Coulson A.R. Drouin J. Eperon I.C. Nierlich D.P. Roe B.A. Sanger F. Schreier P.H. Smith A.J. Staden R. Young I.G.

Genetic information is tightly packed in mtDNA as both strands, denoted as heavy (H) and light (L), are actively transcribed. The only noncoding region (NCR) of substantial size is the mtDNA regulatory region, containing the promoters for mtDNA transcription (HSP1, HSP2, and LSP), the origin of H-strand replication (OH) and several conserved sequences with regulatory functions (for reviews on mtDNA transcription and replication, see Refs. 15Bonawitz N.D.

U.S.A. 1978; 75: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The nascent DNA chain, called 7S DNA, displaces the parental H-strand, generating a triple-stranded displacement loop (named the D-loop) (see Fig. 2C). The function of the D-loop is not fully understood. Top1mt is not essential for murine development. Yet, Top1mt KO mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) show altered oxidative phosphorylation, increased glycolysis and lipid oxidation, defective mitochondrial potential, and increased mitophagy in liver tissues (19Douarre C. Sourbier C. Dalla Rosa I. Brata Das B. Redon C.E. Zhang H. Neckers L. Pommier Y. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I is critical for mitochondrial integrity and cellular energy metabolism.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e41094Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The mtDNA defects of Top1mt KO mice are also exhibited by the hypersensitivity of those mice to the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin (20Khiati S. Dalla Rosa I. Sourbier C. Ma X. Rao V.A. Neckers L.M. Zhang H. Pommier Y. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I (Top1mt) is a novel limiting factor of doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.Clinical Cancer Res. 2014; (in press)10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-13-3373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and their altered mtDNA supercoiling (21Zhang H.

Here we set out to map Top1mt binding sites in vivo in the whole mtDNA genome. Previous mapping of Top1mt sites trapped by CPT has been done by ligation-mediated PCR and limited to the mitochondrial NCR (22Zhang H. Pommier Y. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I sites in the regulatory D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11196-11203Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It revealed that treatment of isolated mitochondria with high CPT concentrations preferentially trapped Top1mt at a cluster of sites downstream to the end of 7S DNA (22Zhang H. Pommier Y. Mitochondrial topoisomerase I sites in the regulatory D-loop region of mitochondrial DNA.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11196-11203Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, using CPT has limitations because of the limited permeability of mitochondria to noncationic molecules and because CPT is readily inactivated at alkaline pH (8Pommier Y. Topoisomerase I inhibitors: camptothecins and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar, 23Burke T.G. Mishra A.K. Wani M.C. Wall M.E. Lipid bilayer partitioning and stability of camptothecin drugs.Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5352-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CPT traps Top1 at selective sequences that are dictated by the drug stacking with the +1 base of the Top1cc, thereby introducing a sequence bias for mapping of Top1cc (24Jaxel C. Capranico G. Kerrigan D. Kohn K.W. Pommier Y. Effect of local DNA sequence on topoisomerase I cleavage in the presence or absence of camptothecin.J. Biol.

To overcome these limitations, we took advantage of the CPT-mimetic mutant established for yeast Top1 (9Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Using tiling microarray and ChIP-on-chip, we show that Top1mtcc maps to specific mtDNA regulatory elements and that transduction of the double-mutant Top1mt produces an acute depletion of mtDNA, thereby providing a novel mean to selectively study the cellular consequences of mtDNA damage resulting from irreversible Top1mtcc. Wild type (WT) and Top1mt knock-out (KO) MEFs were grown as described (19Douarre C. Sourbier C. Dalla Rosa I. Brata Das B. Redon C.E. Zhang H. Neckers L. Pommier Y.

The coding sequence of mouse Top1mt (NM_028404.2) was cloned in the retroviral vector pFB-Neo (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) through link-mediated PCR, generating pFB-Top1mt-Neo. Residues Thr546 and Asn550 of Top1mt were mutated to Ala and His, respectively, using overlap-extension PCR (25Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R.

ChIP-on-chip experiments were performed according to the Agilent mammalian ChIP-on-chip protocol version 10.2. Briefly, five 50% confluent T175-cm2 flasks of Top1mt KO MEFs were transduced with Top1mt*-FLAG or empty vector as control (see Fig. 1). Twenty four hours after transduction, cells were treated with formaldehyde (1.1% final concentration) for 10 min at room temperature, and reactions were stopped by adding 125 mm glycine for 5 min. Cells were then washed with PBS, scraped, and lysed in 2 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors and incubated on ice for 30 min. Lysates were sonicated seven times for 30 s at 30% power to obtain chromatin fragments of approximately 200 base pairs and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of lysates were saved frozen at this point for “no-IP” control. Supernatants were diluted in equal volume of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm DTT) with protease inhibitors and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotating platform with 5 μg/ml anti-FLAG antibody (F1804; Sigma). The following day, 150 μl/ml A/G-Plus agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C on a rotating platform, the beads were washed three times with wash buffer, three times with wash buffer + 200 mm NaCl, three times with LiCl buffer, and twice with Tris-EDTA (TE) (according to the Agilent protocol). The beads were resuspended in 300 μl of TE, 0.5% SDS and transferred in a new tube. At this point the saved 50-μl no-IP lysates were thawed and diluted in TE, 0.5% SDS and treated in parallel with the IP samples. 20 mg/ml proteinase K were added to all samples, followed by incubation for 6 h at 65 °C with continuous shaking. After centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 1 min) the chromatin in the supernatants was extracted with an equal volume of phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, and ethanol-precipitated with 20 mg/ml glycogen. DNA pellets were resuspended in 65 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Both IP and no-IP DNA samples were amplified, labeled, and hybridized according to the Agilent protocol. For each probe on the array, the no-IP signal was subtracted from the IP signal (log2 values). Positive values indicate mtDNA regions where the IP signal is higher than its corresponding no-IP (Top1mt-enriched regions).FIGURE 1T546A and N550H mutations trap Top1mt.

For production of Top1mt*, human mature Top1mt was mutated (T554A and N558H) and expressed as described for native Top1mt. DNA cleavage assays were carried out as described (27Dexheimer T.S.

PCRs were performed in triplicate on 384-well plates. Each PCR (final volume 10 μl) contained 25 ng of DNA, 5 μl of Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and a 0.5 μm concentration of each forward and reverse primer. The COX1 gene was amplified, and POLG2 was used as normalizing control. The primers used were: Cox1-F, TTTTCAGGCTTCACCCTAGATGA; Cox1-R, CCTACGAATATGATGGCGAAGTG; ASPG2-F, GGAGGAGGCACTTTCTCAGC; and ASPG2-R, GAAGACCTGCTCCCTGAACAC. Mitochondrial mass was measured by nonyl acridine orange staining (Invitrogen). Cells (from one T25-cm2 flask) were treated with 50 nm nonyl acridine orange for 30 min at 37 °C and then trypsinized and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were resuspended in 1 ml of prewarmed Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Our rationale for these experiments is that substitutions of Thr722 (T722A) and Asn726 (N726H) in yeast Top1 alter its cleavage/religation equilibrium, increasing the stability of Top1cc and enhancing the Top1-DNA binding rate (9Megonigal M.D. Fertala J.

Because the active sites of yeast Top1 and Top1mt are well conserved (Fig. 1A), we hypothesized that the corresponding mutations in Top1mt would generate an enzyme prone to trapping mtDNA. Thus, we mutated Thr546 and Asn550 in mouse Top1mt (T546A and N550H) and transduced native or mutated Top1mt constructs (Top1mt and Top1mt*, respectively) in Top1mt KO MEFs (Fig. 1B). Top1mt and Top1mt* polypeptides were readily detected at comparable expression levels 1 day after transduction (Fig. 1C). To determine whether Top1mt* formed the expected high levels of topoisomerase-mtDNA complexes, we compared Top1mtcc in cells expressing Top1mt* versus Top1mt (Fig. 1D). We also used high concentrations of topotecan (TPT), the clinical water-soluble camptothecin derivative (8Pommier Y. Topoisomerase I inhibitors: camptothecins and beyond.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 789-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar), which enters mitochondria (28Croce A.C. Bottiroli G. Supino R. Favini E. Zuco V. Zunino F. Subcellular localization of the camptothecin analogues, topotecan and gimatecan.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1035-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to trap Top1mtcc. Unlike wild type Top1mt, which required the presence of TPT to form cleavage complexes, Top1mt*cc were readily detectable in the absence of drug (Fig. 1D). To demonstrate the specificity of the Top1mtcc detection, we also treated Top1mt KO cells transfected with empty virus with TPT. Lack of Top1mt signal confirmed the selectivity of our Top1mt antibody, as TPT, under these conditions induces high levels of cleavage complexes with nuclear Top1 (29Tanizawa A. Fujimori A. Fujimori Y. Pommier Y. Comparison of topoisomerase I inhibition, DNA damage, and cytotoxicity of camptothecin derivatives presently in clinical trials.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86: 836-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). These results show that Top1mt* bearing the two substitutions T546A and N550H produces elevated levels of Top1mt*cc in the absence of any drugs. Having established that Top1mt* behaved as a poisoning topoisomerase, we used it to map Top1mt binding sites in the mitochondrial genome. To do so, we designed a tiling array for the mouse mtDNA including 3260 probes, where 55 of 60 nucleotides of each probe overlapped with the next one (Fig. 2A, left). We performed ChIP in Top1mt KO MEFs expressing Top1mt* and hybridized the DNA fragments covalently bound to Top1mt* on the array (Fig. 2A, right and bottom panels). Fig. 2B summarizes the distribution of Top1mt* sites over the entire mitochondrial genome (shown linearized instead of circular to simplify the presentation). Top1mt* sites were prominently enriched in the NCR, as well as at multiples sites within the ribosomal genes (12S and 16S). To ensure that the signals observed were Top1mt-specific, we performed the same ChIP-on-chip protocol in Top1mt KO MEFs transduced with empty vector (supplemental Fig. 1). Because these cells did not express Top1mt, all sequences immunoprecipitated in these samples can be considered nonspecific. IP signals from Top1mt KO cells gave completely different readouts in the negative control, particularly in the NCR, eliminating the possibility that the peaks from Top1mt* mapping results could be false positive peaks.

The prevention requires a high level of lasting actions from the patients, which may be burdensome. The aim of this trial was to evaluate the effectiveness of a training course for general practice nurses in motivation support at 18 months follow-up in the affiliated type 2 diabetes population. Methods Forty general practices with nurse-led diabetes consultations from the area of Aarhus, Denmark were randomised 1∶1 to either intervention or usual practice. Intervention practices were offered a 16-hour Self-determination theory - based course including communication training for general practice nurses delivered over 10 months. The affiliated diabetes populations (aged 40–74 years) were identified from registers (intervention n = 2,005; usual n = 2,029). Primary outcomes were register-based glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) -, total cholesterol levels, and well-being measured by the Problem Areas In Diabetes scale (PAID) and the mental component summary score, SF12 (SF12, mcs). Intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Predefined subgroups analyses were performed. Results The differences between the intervention- and the control practices’ mean HbA1c and total cholesterol at follow-up adjusted for baseline values and clustering were respectively: −0.02%-points (95% CI: −0.11 to 0.07; p: 0.67); 0.08 mmol/l (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.15; p: 0.02). Differences in median scores adjusted for clustering were for PAID: 1.25; p = 0.31 and SF12, mcs: 0.99; p = 0.15. Women in intervention practices differed from women in usual practices on mean HbA1c: −0.12%-points (−0.23 to −0.02; p = 0.02) and SF12, mcs: 2.6; p = 0.01. Conclusions Offering a training course for general practice nurses in applying the Self-determination theory in current type 2 diabetes care had no effect compared with usual practice measured by HbA1c and total cholesterol levels and the well-being at 18 months of follow-up in a comprehensive register-based diabetes population. Subgroup analyses suggested a possible effect in women, which deserves further attention. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier NCT01187069)."

However, the specificity of apamin in cardiac tissues remains unclear.To test the hypothesis that apamin does not inhibit any major cardiac ion currents.We studied human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells that expressed human voltage-gated Na+, K+ and Ca2+ currents and isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes. Whole-cell patch clamp techniques were used to determine ionic current densities before and after apamin administration.Ca2+ currents (CACNA1c+CACNB2b) were not affected by apamin (500 nM) (data are presented as median [25th percentile;75th percentile] (from -16 [-20;-10] to -17 [-19;-13] pA/pF, P = NS), but were reduced by nifedipine to -1.6 [-3.2;-1.3] pA/pF (p = 0.008). Na+ currents (SCN5A) were not affected by apamin (from -261 [-282;-145] to -268 [-379;-132] pA/pF, P = NS), but were reduced by flecainide to -57 [-70;-47] pA/pF (p = 0.018). None of the major K+ currents (IKs, IKr, IK1 and Ito) were inhibited by 500 nM of apamin (KCNQ1+KCNE1, from 28 [20]; [37] to 23 [18]; [32] pA/pF; KCNH2+KCNE2, from 28 [24]; [30] to 27 [24]; [29] pA/pF; KCNJ2, from -46 [-48;-40] to -46 [-51;-35] pA/pF; KCND3, from 608 [505;748] to 606 [454;684]). Apamin did not inhibit the INa or ICaL in isolated rabbit ventricular myocytes (INa, from -67 [-75;-59] to -68 [-71;-59] pA/pF; ICaL, from -16 [-17;-14] to -14 [-15;-13] pA/pF, P = NS for both).Apamin does not inhibit human cardiac Na+ currents, L-type Ca2+ currents or other major K+ currents. These findings indicate that apamin is a specific SK current inhibitor in hearts as well as in other organs."

Status for eight chronic diseases (CDs) was determined by biomedical measurement or self-report. Chronic disease (CD) mean age of occurrence and order of appearance was investigated.The prevalence of multimorbidity increased from 32% to 64% during the 7.8±1.1 years of follow-up. The estimated mean age of onset of a new CD was significantly older for hypertension, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and younger for hypercholesterolemia, asthma and other mental problem. Hypercholesterolemia was more likely to develop as a first than as a subsequent CD (39%vs.16%, p<0.0001) while CVD (1%vs.5%, p<0.0001), diabetes (5%vs.11%, p<0.001) and COPD (6%vs.16%, p<0.0001) were less likely. The presence of mood disorders at baseline was associated with an increased risk of developing other mental disorders (36%vs.12%, p<0.0001), diabetes (18%vs.9%, p<0.01) and asthma (30%vs.21%, p<0.05).Longitudinal data could be used to study the evolution of multimorbidity and could provide information on CDs mean age of occurrence, order of appearance and impact on the development of future CDs."
https://openalex.org/W2107003419,"Background TIMI frame count (TFC) predicts outcomes in patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD); it remains unclear whether TFC predicts outcomes in patients without obstructive CAD. Methods TFC was determined in a sample of women with no obstructive CAD enrolled in the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation (WISE) study. Because TFC is known to be higher in the left anterior descending artery (LAD), TFC determined in the LAD was divided by 1.7 to provide a corrected TFC (cTFC). Results A total of 298 women, with angiograms suitable for TFC analysis and long-term (6–10 year) follow up data, were included in this sub-study. Their age was 55±11 years, most were white (86%), half had a history of smoking, and half had a history of hypertension. Higher resting cTFC was associated with a higher rate of hospitalization for angina (34% in women with a cTFC >35, 15% in women with a cTFC ≤35, P<0.001). cTFC provided independent prediction of hospitalization for angina after adjusting for many baseline characteristics. In this cohort, resting cTFC was not predictive of major events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, or all-cause death), cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, or cardiovascular mortality. Conclusions In women with signs and symptoms of ischemia but no obstructive CAD, resting cTFC provides independent prediction of hospitalization for angina. Larger studies are required to determine if resting TFC is predictive of major events in patients without obstructive coronary artery disease."

According to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria, these subjects (examinations) were classified into five different subgroups, namely non-COPD (222 subjects), GOLD-I (83 subjects), GOLD-II (141 subjects), GOLD-III (63 subjects), and GOLD-IV (64 subjects), in terms of disease severity. An available computer tool was used to aid in an objective and efficient quantification of fissure integrity. The correlations between fissure integrity, and pulmonary functions (e.g., FEV1, and FEV1/FVC) and COPD severity were assessed using Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficients, respectively.For the five sub-groups ranging from non-COPD to GOLD-IV, the average integrities of the right oblique fissure (ROF) were 81.8%, 82.4%, 81.8%, 82.8%, and 80.2%, respectively; the average integrities of the right horizontal fissure (RHF) were 62.6%, 61.8%, 62.1%, 62.2%, and 62.3%, respectively; the average integrities of the left oblique fissure (LOF) were 82.0%, 83.2%, 81.7%, 82.0%, and 78.4%, respectively; and the average integrities of all fissures in the entire lung were 78.0%, 78.6%, 78.1%, 78.5%, and 76.4%, respectively. Their Pearson correlation coefficients with FEV1 and FE1/FVC range from 0.027 to 0.248 with p values larger than 0.05. Their Spearman correlation coefficients with COPD severity except GOLD-IV range from -0.013 to -0.073 with p values larger than 0.08.There is no significant difference in fissure integrity for patients with different levels of disease severity, suggesting that the development of COPD does not change the completeness of pulmonary fissures and incomplete fissures alone may not contribute to the collateral ventilation."
https://openalex.org/W2064111933,"Porous biomaterial is the preferred implant due to the interconnectivity of the pores. Chances of infection due to biofilm are also high in these biomaterials because of the presence of pores. Although biofilm in implants contributes to 80% of human infections [1], there are no commercially available natural therapeutics against it. In the current study, glutaraldehyde cross linked lipase was transferred onto a activated porous polycaprolactam surface using Langmuir-Blodgett deposition technique, and its thermostability, slimicidal, antibacterial, biocompatibility and surface properties were studied. There was a 20% increase in the activity of the covalently crosslinked lipase when compared to its free form. This immobilized surface was thermostable and retained activity and stability until 100°C. There was a 2 and 7 times reduction in carbohydrate and 9 and 5 times reduction in biofilm protein of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli respectively on lipase immobilized polycaprolactam (LIP) when compared to uncoated polycaprolactam (UP). The number of live bacterial colonies on LIP was four times less than on UP. Lipase acted on the cell wall of the bacteria leading to its death, which was confirmed from AFM, fluorescence microscopic images and amount of lactate dehydrogenase released. LIP allowed proliferation of more than 90% of 3T3 cells indicating that it was biocompatible. The fact that LIP exhibits antimicrobial property at the air-water interface to hydrophobic as well as hydrophilic bacteria along with lack of cytotoxicity makes it an ideal biomaterial for biofilm prevention in implants."
https://openalex.org/W2086031749,"The contribution of arterial calcification (AC) in peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and arterial wall compressibility is a matter of debate. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE), an inherited metabolic disease due to ABCC6 gene mutations, combines elastic fiber fragmentation and calcification in various soft tissues including the arterial wall. Since AC is associated with PAD, a frequent complication of PXE, we sought to determine the role of AC in PAD and arterial wall compressibility in this group of patients.Arterial compressibility and patency were determined by ankle-brachial pressure index (ABI) in a cohort of 71 PXE patients (mean age 48 ± SD 14 yrs, 45 women) and compared to 30 controls without PAD. Lower limb arterial calcification (LLAC) was determined by non-contrast enhanced helicoidal CT-scan. A calcification score (Ca-score) was computed for the femoral, popliteal and sub-popliteal artery segments of both legs. Forty patients with PXE had an ABI<0.90 and none had an ABI>1.40. LLAC increased with age, significantly more in PXE subjects than controls. A negative association was found between LLAC and ABI (r = -0.363, p = 0.002). The LLAC was independently associated with PXE and age, and ABI was not linked to cardiovascular risk factors.The presence of AC was associated with PAD and PXE without affecting arterial compressibility. PAD in PXE patients is probably due to proximal obstructive lesions developing independently from cardiovascular risk factors."
https://openalex.org/W1980827007,"In athletics, motor performance is determined by different abilities such as technique, endurance, strength and speed. Based on animal studies, motor speed is thought to be encoded in the basal ganglia, sensorimotor cortex and the cerebellum. The question arises whether there is a unique structural feature in the human brain, which allows ""power athletes"" to perform a simple foot movement significantly faster than ""endurance athletes"". We acquired structural and functional brain imaging data from 32 track-and-field athletes. The study comprised of 16 ""power athletes"" requiring high speed foot movements (sprinters, jumpers, throwers) and 16 endurance athletes (distance runners) which in contrast do not require as high speed foot movements. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to identify speed specific regions of interest in the brain during fast and slow foot movements. Anatomical MRI scans were performed to assess structural grey matter volume differences between athletes groups (voxel based morphometry). We tested maximum movement velocity of plantarflexion (PF-Vmax) and acquired electromyographical activity of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius muscle. Behaviourally, a significant difference between the two groups of athletes was noted in PF-Vmax and fMRI indicates that fast plantarflexions are accompanied by increased activity in the cerebellar anterior lobe. The same region indicates increased grey matter volume for the power athletes compared to the endurance counterparts. Our results suggest that speed-specific neuro-functional and -structural differences exist between power and endurance athletes in the peripheral and central nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2051806971,"TRPV1 channels are an important class of membrane proteins that play an integral role in the regulation of intracellular cations such as calcium in many different tissue types. The anionic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is a known positive modulator of TRPV1 channels and the negatively charged phosphate groups interact with several basic amino acid residues in the proximal C-terminal TRP domain of the TRPV1 channel. We and other groups have shown that physiological sub-micromolar levels of long-chain acyl CoAs (LC-CoAs), another ubiquitous anionic lipid, can also act as positive modulators of ion channels and exchangers. Therefore, we investigated whether TRPV1 channel activity is similarly regulated by LC-CoAs. Our results show that LC-CoAs are potent activators of the TRPV1 channel and interact with the same PIP2-binding residues in TRPV1. In contrast to PIP2, LC-CoA modulation of TRPV1 is independent of Ca2+i, acting in an acyl side-chain saturation and chain-length dependent manner. Elevation of LC-CoAs in intact Jurkat T-cells leads to significant increases in agonist-induced Ca2+i levels. Our novel findings indicate that LC-CoAs represent a new fundamental mechanism for regulation of TRPV1 channel activity that may play a role in diverse cell types under physiological and pathophysiological conditions that alter fatty acid transport and metabolism such as obesity and diabetes."

Materials and Methods All clinicopathologic parameters and perioperative parameters of 311 patients who underwent RC with either Neo or IC by a single surgeon from 1999 to 2012 were retrospectively included in this study. Patients with a history of renal surgery, concomitant UUTR, or a histopathology of non-transitional cell carcinoma were excluded. For statistical analyses of predictive risk factors of UUTR, a multivariate analysis was performed with known risk factors of UUTR, including type of urinary diversion with significance defined as P < 0.05. Results During the median follow-up period of 53 months, 143 (46.0%) IC and 168 (54.0%) Neo were performed, resulting in 11 (3.5%) cases of UUTR (Neo 7 and IC 4) after RC and all patients then underwent nephroureterectomy. No significant differences in incidence and overall survival in UUTR were observed according different types of urinary diversion (p = 483), and the prognosis for survival of Neo was insignificantly better than that of IC (5-year overall survival 78% vs 74%, respectively, p>0.05). Higher number of positive lymph nodes (HR 9.03) and the presence of pelvic local recurrence (HR 7286.08) were significant predictive factors of UUTR (p<0.05). Conclusion This study reports a UUTR rate of 3.5%, and positive lymph nodes and presence of local recurrence at the pelvis as important risk factors. No significant differences in incidence and survival were observed between Neo and IC."

Here, we demonstrate that the human δ-opioid receptor (hδOR) is subjected to ERQC in both N-glycan-dependent and -independent manners. This was shown by investigating the biosynthesis and trafficking of wild-type and non-N-glycosylated F27C variants in metabolic pulse-chase assays coupled with flow cytometry and cell surface biotinylation. Both QC mechanisms distinguished the minute one-amino acid difference between the variants, targeting a large fraction of hδOR-Cys27 to ERAD. However, the N-glycan-independent QC was unable to compensate the N-glycan-dependent pathway, and some incompletely folded non-N-glycosylated hδOR-Cys27 reached the cell surface in conformation incompatible with ligand binding. The turnover of receptors associating with the molecular chaperone calnexin (CNX) was significantly slower for the hδOR-Cys27, pointing to an important role of CNX in the hδOR N-glycan-dependent QC. This was further supported by the fact that inhibiting the co-translational interaction of hδOR-Cys27 precursors with CNX led to their ERAD. Opioid receptor pharmacological chaperones released the CNX-bound receptors to ER export and, furthermore, were able to rescue the Cys27 variant from polyubiquitination and retrotranslocation to the cytosol whether carrying N-glycans or not. Taken together, the hδOR appears to rely primarily on the CNX-mediated N-glycan-dependent QC that has the capacity to assist in folding, whereas the N-glycan-independent mechanism constitutes an alternative, although less accurate, system for directing misfolded/incompletely folded receptors to ERAD, possibly in altered cellular conditions.

For example, mutant forms of a number of polytopic membrane proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) rhodopsin and V2 vasopressin and melanocortin-4 receptors, are characterized by ER retention, which is one of the underlying causes for retinitis pigmentosa, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and morbid obesity, respectively (5Bichet D.G.

These findings underscore the need to understand the complex mechanisms and components of the ERQC in a more comprehensive manner. The first lectin chaperone that a nascent glycoprotein encounters in the ER is calnexin (CNX), a membrane protein that is closely associated with the translocon and the oligosaccharyl transferase that adds the core N-glycan (N-acetylglucosamine2-mannose9-glucose3) to the nascent polypeptide chain (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Roles of N-linked glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 2Aebi M. Bernasconi R. Clerc S. Molinari M. N-glycan structures: recognition and processing in the ER.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). CNX and its lumenal counterpart calreticulin (CRT) bind to oligosaccharides in their monoglucosylated form in a cycle of attempts to fold and refold the substrate protein, which is known as the CNX/CRT cycle (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Roles of N-linked glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 2Aebi M. Bernasconi R. Clerc S. Molinari M. N-glycan structures: recognition and processing in the ER.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). CNX and CRT assist in folding by recruiting ER foldases ERp57 and cyclophilin B (17Pearse B.R. Hebert D.N.

These enzymes, belonging to the protein disulfide isomerase and peptidyl prolyl cis/trans-isomerase families, respectively, catalyze rate-limiting steps in protein folding (19Braakman I. Bulleid N.J. Protein folding and modification in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 71-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). While assisting in folding, CNX and CRT are also involved in the surveillance of the folding status of their substrates in an attempt to ensure that only those with correct conformation leave the ER. During the CNX/CRT cycle, the folding intermediates dissociate from CNX/CRT when the remaining glucose is removed from the N-glycan, enabling interaction with the folding sensor UDP-glucose:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. If the substrate protein has not reached the native conformation, glucose is readded, and the cycle continues (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Roles of N-linked glycans in the endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1609) Google Scholar, 2Aebi M. Bernasconi R. Clerc S. Molinari M. N-glycan structures: recognition and processing in the ER.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2010; 35: 74-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Substrates failing to reach the correct conformation in time are demannosylated and targeted for degradation in a series of events called as the ER-associated degradation (ERAD). The targeting involves a number of factors, like EDEMs (ER-degradation-enhancing mannosidase-like proteins), OS9, and XTP3-B/erlectin, the last two of which are lectins (2Aebi M. Bernasconi R.

Removal of the two N-glycosylation sites of the hδOR-Cys27 variant by site-directed mutagenesis leads to a further decrease in receptor cell surface expression (23Markkanen P.M. Petäjä-Repo U.E.

This was found to result mostly from the prominent internalization and lysosomal degradation of plasma membrane receptors (23Markkanen P.M. Petäjä-Repo U.E.

Furthermore, the non-N-glycosylated hδOR-Cys27 was found to be exported from the ER with enhanced kinetics and reach the cell surface partially in a nonnative conformation, unable to bind a ligand (23Markkanen P.M. Petäjä-Repo U.E. N-Glycan-mediated quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum is required for the expression of correctly folded δ-opioid receptors at the cell surface.J. Biol.

This suggests that the variant is normally retained in the ER by the glycoprotein QC machinery but is able to escape the compartment when N-glycosylation sites have been disrupted. The present study was undertaken to characterize the glycoprotein ERQC mechanisms that monitor newly synthesized hδORs in more detail, focusing on its major component CNX that acts early in the folding/degradation pathway. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether the targeting of newly synthesized hδORs to ERAD requires N-glycosylation, i.e. whether they are substrates of N-glycan-independent ERQC. The hδOR-Cys27-pFT-SMMF and hδOR-Phe27-pFT-SMMF constructs encoding WT hδOR Cys27 and Phe27 variants, respectively, have been described previously (28Leskelä T.T. Markkanen P.M. Alahuhta I.A.

These receptor constructs include a cleavable influenza HA signal peptide, an N-terminal Myc tag, and a C-terminal FLAG tag (see Fig. 1A). The hδOR-Cys27(N18E,N33E) mutant in the pFT-SMMF vector was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis as described (23Markkanen P.M. Petäjä-Repo U.E.

Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM), and the appropriate selection antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments, cells were plated on 24-well plates (0.1–0.2 × 106 cells), 75-cm2 culture flasks (5–6 × 106 cells), 25-cm2 culture flasks (2 × 106 cells), or 100-mm plates (5–6 × 106 cells) and cultured for 3 days in complete DMEM. The receptor expression in HEK293i cell lines was induced by supplementing the culture medium with tetracycline (500 ng/ml, Invitrogen) for 24 h, unless otherwise stated. For Western blotting and metabolic labeling experiments, cells were incubated in PBS, 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 10 min before harvesting, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. For transient transfections, 4 × 106 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates and cultured for 24 h before transfection with HA-ubiquitin (5 μg). Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions (15 μl). After 4 h, cells were trypsinized and divided on two 25-cm2 culture flasks and cultured overnight for metabolic labeling. Cells were incubated in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM for 60 min, and labeling was performed in fresh medium with 75–150 μCi/ml of [35S]methionine/cysteine (Easytag Express 35S-protein labeling mix, 1175 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 30 or 60 min. The labeling was stopped by washing, and cells were chased in complete DMEM, supplemented with 5 mm methionine, for various periods of time as specified in the figures. The proteasomal inhibitor lactacystin (LA, 10 μm; Enzo Life Sciences or Merck Millipore) was added into the depletion medium and was maintained throughout labeling and chase. The glucosidase I/II inhibitor castanospermine (CST, 150 μg/ml; Enzo Life Sciences) was added into the depletion medium and was maintained thereafter. Alternatively, it was removed after labeling or added only to the chase medium, as specified in the figures. The opioid antagonists naltriben (10 μm; Tocris) and naltrexone (NTX; 10 μm; Tocris) were added to the pulse and chase medium or only to the chase medium, respectively. Control samples were treated with the corresponding vehicles. Cell surface proteins in stably transfected HEK293i cells were biotinylated with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Thermo Fischer Scientific) as described previously (26Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A.

For the chase, the residual biotin was quenched with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and cells were incubated in complete DMEM at 37 °C before harvesting. Total cellular lysates were prepared by mixing thawed cells for 30 min in buffer A (0.5% (w/v) n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (Enzo Life Sciences), 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm PMSF, 2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 10 μg/ml benzamidine). For CNX immunoprecipitation, the detergent was replaced with 0.5% (w/v) digitonin (Merck Millipore), and the buffer contained 10 mm CaCl2 and lacked 1,10-phenanthroline and EDTA (buffer B). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatants were supplemented with 0.1% (w/v) BSA before immunoprecipitation. Receptors and HA-ubiquitin were purified with one- or two-step immunoprecipitation using FLAG M2 or HA antibody resins (Sigma), respectively. The antibody-coupled resin (15–20 μl) was added to the lysates and incubated under gentle agitation for 1–16 h. For CNX co-immunoprecipitation, samples were first precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h and then incubated with polyclonal rabbit CNX antibody (1:100; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h before adding protein G-Sepharose for 2 h. Preimmune serum was used as a control. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer A/B and four times with buffer C/D (like buffer A/B but containing 0.1% detergent). Precipitated proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue) or FLAG peptide (0.2 mg/ml) in buffer C, followed by concentration with Microcon-30 concentrators (Merck Millipore). For two-step immunoprecipitation, proteins were first eluted by incubating in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% (w/v) SDS, at 95 °C for 5 min and thereafter diluted 10-fold with buffer A for reimmunoprecipitation. For deglycosylation, the receptors were eluted in 1% (w/v) SDS, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.5. All steps during lysate preparation and immunoprecipitation were performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Purified receptors were subjected to enzymatic deglycosylation with neuraminidase and O-glycosidase or with endoglycosidase H, as described previously (all 50 millunits/ml; Roche Applied Science) (23Markkanen P.M.

https://openalex.org/W1997646658,"Organic soils are an important source of N2O, but global estimates of these fluxes remain uncertain because measurements are sparse. We tested the hypothesis that N2O fluxes can be predicted from estimates of mineral nitrogen input, calculated from readily-available measurements of CO2 flux and soil C/N ratio. From studies of organic soils throughout the world, we compiled a data set of annual CO2 and N2O fluxes which were measured concurrently. The input of soil mineral nitrogen in these studies was estimated from applied fertilizer nitrogen and organic nitrogen mineralization. The latter was calculated by dividing the rate of soil heterotrophic respiration by soil C/N ratio. This index of mineral nitrogen input explained up to 69% of the overall variability of N2O fluxes, whereas CO2 flux or soil C/N ratio alone explained only 49% and 36% of the variability, respectively. Including water table level in the model, along with mineral nitrogen input, further improved the model with the explanatory proportion of variability in N2O flux increasing to 75%. Unlike grassland or cropland soils, forest soils were evidently nitrogen-limited, so water table level had no significant effect on N2O flux. Our proposed approach, which uses the product of soil-derived CO2 flux and the inverse of soil C/N ratio as a proxy for nitrogen mineralization, shows promise for estimating regional or global N2O fluxes from organic soils, although some further enhancements may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2062316826,"Land use change is the most significant driver linked to global species extinctions. In Northern Australia, the landscape is still relatively intact with very low levels of clearing. However, a re-energized political discourse around creating a northern food bowl means that currently intact ecosystems in northern Australia could be under imminent threat from increased land clearing and water extraction. These impacts are likely to be concentrated in a few regions with suitable soils and water supplies. The Daly River Catchment in the Northern Territory is an important catchment for both conservation and development. Land use in the Daly catchment has been subject to clearing guidelines that are largely untested in terms of their eventual implications for the spatial configuration of conservation and development. Given the guidelines are not legislated they might also be removed or revised by subsequent Territory Governments, including the recently-elected one. We examine the uncertainties around the spatial implications of full implementation of the Daly clearing guidelines and their potential effects on equity of opportunity across land tenures and land uses. We also examine how removal of the guidelines could affect conservation in the catchment. We conclude that the guidelines are important in supporting development in the catchment while still achieving conservation goals, and we recommend ways of implementing the guidelines to make best use of available land resources for intensified production."
https://openalex.org/W2090710252,"High-risk human papillomavirus oncoproteins E6 and E7 play a major role in HPV-related cancers. One of the main functions of E7 is the degradation of pRb, while E6 promotes the degradation of p53, inactivating the p14ARF-p53 pathway. pRb and p14ARF can repress ribosomal DNA (rDNA) transcription in part by targeting the Upstream Binding Factor 1 (UBF1), a key factor in the activation of RNA polymerase I machinery. We showed, through ectopic expression and siRNA silencing of p14ARF and/or E7, that E7 stimulates UBF1-mediated rDNA gene transcription, partly because of increased levels of phosphorylated UBF1, preventing the inhibitory function of p14ARF. Unexpectedly, activation of rDNA gene transcription was higher in cells co-expressing p14ARF and E7, compared to cells expressing E7 alone. We did not find a difference in P-UBF1 levels that could explain this data. However, p14ARF expression induced E7 to accumulate into the nucleolus, where rDNA transcription takes place, providing an opportunity for E7 to interact with nucleolar proteins involved in this process. GST-pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays showed interactions between p14ARF, UBF1 and E7, although p14ARF and E7 are not able to directly interact. Co-expression of a pRb-binding-deficient mutant (E7C24G) and p14ARF resulted in EC24G nucleolar accumulation, but not in a significant higher activation of rDNA transcription, suggesting that the inactivation of pRb is involved in this phenomenon. Thus, p14ARF fails to prevent E7-mediated UBF1 phosphorylation, but could facilitate nucleolar pRb inactivation by targeting E7 to the nucleolus. While others have reported that p19ARF, the mouse homologue of p14ARF, inhibits some functions of E7, we showed that E7 inhibits a p53-independent function of p14ARF. These results point to a mutually functional interaction between p14ARF and E7 that might partly explain why the sustained p14ARF expression observed in most cervical pre-malignant lesions and malignancies may be ineffective."
https://openalex.org/W2093458369,"Intellectual disability affects 2–3% of the population; mutations of the X-chromosome are a major cause of moderate to severe cases. The link between the molecular consequences of the mutation and impaired cognitive function remains unclear. Loss of function mutations of oligophrenin-1 (OPHN1) disrupt Rho-GTPase signalling. Here we demonstrate abnormal neurotransmission at CA3 synapses in hippocampal slices from Ophn1-/y mice, resulting from a substantial decrease in the readily releasable pool of vesicles. As a result, synaptic transmission fails at high frequencies required for oscillations associated with cognitive functions. Both spontaneous and KA-induced gamma oscillations were reduced in Ophn1-/y hippocampal slices. Spontaneous oscillations were rapidly rescued by inhibition of the downstream signalling pathway of oligophrenin-1. These findings suggest that the intellectual disability due to mutations of oligophrenin-1 results from a synaptopathy and consequent network malfunction, providing a plausible mechanism for the learning disabilities. Furthermore, they raise the prospect of drug treatments for affected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2004841879,"Tethered particle motion (TPM) experiments can be used to detect time-resolved loop formation in a single DNA molecule by measuring changes in the length of a DNA tether. Interpretation of such experiments is greatly aided by computer simulations of DNA looping which allow one to analyze the structure of the looped DNA and estimate DNA-protein binding constants specific for the loop formation process. We here present a new Monte Carlo scheme for accurate simulation of DNA configurations subject to geometric constraints and apply this method to Lac repressor mediated DNA looping, comparing the simulation results with new experimental data obtained by the TPM technique. Our simulations, taking into account the details of attachment of DNA ends and fluctuations of the looped subsegment of the DNA, reveal the origin of the double-peaked distribution of RMS values observed by TPM experiments by showing that the average RMS value for anti-parallel loop types is smaller than that of parallel loop types. The simulations also reveal that the looping probabilities for the anti-parallel loop types are significantly higher than those of the parallel loop types, even for loops of length 600 and 900 base pairs, and that the correct proportion between the heights of the peaks in the distribution can only be attained when loops with flexible Lac repressor conformation are taken into account. Comparison of the in silico and in vitro results yields estimates for the dissociation constants characterizing the binding affinity between O1 and Oid DNA operators and the dimeric arms of the Lac repressor."
https://openalex.org/W2111177322,"In host cells, Mycobacterium tuberculosis encounters an array of reactive molecules capable of damaging its genome. Non-bulky DNA lesions are the most common damages produced on the exposure of the pathogen to reactive species and base excision repair (BER) pathway is involved in the repair of such damage. During BER, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease enzymes repair the abasic sites that are generated after spontaneous DNA base loss or by the action of DNA glycosylases, which if left unrepaired lead to inhibition of replication and transcription. However, the role of AP endonucleases in imparting protection against DNA damage and in the growth and pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis has not yet been elucidated. To demonstrate the biological significance of these enzymes in M.tuberculosis, it would be desirable to disrupt the relevant genes and evaluate the resulting mutants for their ability to grow in the host and cause disease. In this study, we have generated M.tuberculosis mutants of the base excision repair (BER) system, disrupted in either one (MtbΔend or MtbΔxthA) or both the AP endonucleases (MtbΔendΔxthA). We demonstrate that these genes are crucial for bacteria to withstand alkylation and oxidative stress in vitro. In addition, the mutant disrupted in both the AP endonucleases (MtbΔendΔxthA) exhibited a significant reduction in its ability to survive inside human macrophages. However, infection of guinea pigs with either MtbΔend or MtbΔxthA or MtbΔendΔxthA resulted in the similar bacillary load and pathological damage in the organs as observed in the case of infection with wild-type M.tuberculosis. The implications of these observations are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2095492664,"The immunosuppressant Protosappanin A (PrA), isolated from the medicinal herb, promotes cardiac allograft survival, diminishes inflammatory cell infiltration, and inhibits interferon γ-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10) mRNA expression in rats cardiac grafts. Binding of the chemokine IP-10 to its cognate receptor, CXCR3, plays crucial roles in allograft immunity, especially by mediating the recruitment of effector T cells to allografted tissues. In this study, we attempted to determine whether PrA-mediated inhibition of IP-10 contributes to the effect of reduced T cell infiltration into cardiac allograft within a rat model. Administration of PrA (25 mg/kg daily) via oral gavage following heart transplantation significantly reduced the increase of IP-10 mRNA level in allograft and prevented IP-10 secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from recipient rats seven days posttransplantation. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that PrA addition to control PBMC prevented IP-10 secretion. Chemotactic migration assays were utilized to evaluate recipient T cell migration towards PBMC supernatant. PrA administration impaired PBMC supernatant-induced T cell migration. Additional in vitro experiments revealed that PrA slightly reduced naïve T cell migration towards chemokines. The presence of IP-10 in PBMC supernatant prevented PrA from reducing T cell migration in PrA-treated recipients. Neither CXCR3 chemokine ligand Mig nor non-CXCR3 chemokine ligand SDF-1 had any effect on T cell migration in PrA-treated recipients. The addition of anti-CXCR3 antibody restored PrA-mediated inhibition of T cell migration. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that IP-10 was expressed mainly in CD68 positive infiltrating monocytes. Furthermore, PrA consistently reduced CXCR3+T cell infiltration into cardiac allografts. The reduced intensity of CXCR3 staining in PrA-treated allografts contributed to the previously depressed naïve T cell migrating activity induced by PrA. Collectively, these data indicate that PrA inhibition of IP-10 activity reduced recipient T cell migration and infiltration of cardiac allografts, thus partially explaining the immunosuppressive effect of PrA."
https://openalex.org/W2045715327,"Modern driver assistance systems make increasing use of auditory and tactile signals in order to reduce the driver's visual information load. This entails potential crossmodal interaction effects that need to be taken into account in designing an optimal system. Here we show that saccadic reaction times to visual targets (cockpit or outside mirror), presented in a driving simulator environment and accompanied by auditory or tactile accessories, follow some well-known spatiotemporal rules of multisensory integration, usually found under confined laboratory conditions. Auditory nontargets speed up reaction time by about 80 ms. The effect tends to be maximal when the nontarget is presented 50 ms before the target and when target and nontarget are spatially coincident. The effect of a tactile nontarget (vibrating steering wheel) was less pronounced and not spatially specific. It is shown that the average reaction times are well-described by the stochastic ""time window of integration"" model for multisensory integration developed by the authors. This two-stage model postulates that crossmodal interaction occurs only if the peripheral processes from the different sensory modalities terminate within a fixed temporal interval, and that the amount of crossmodal interaction manifests itself in an increase or decrease of second stage processing time. A qualitative test is consistent with the model prediction that the probability of interaction, but not the amount of crossmodal interaction, depends on target-nontarget onset asynchrony. A quantitative model fit yields estimates of individual participants' parameters, including the size of the time window. Some consequences for the design of driver assistance systems are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2025780982,"The AP-2 clathrin adaptor complex oversees endocytic cargo selection in two parallel but independent manners. First, by physically engaging peptide-based endocytic sorting signals, a subset of clathrin-dependent transmembrane cargo is directly collected into assembling buds. Synchronously, by interacting with an assortment of clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) that independently select different integral membrane cargo for inclusion within the incipient bud, AP-2 handles additional cargo capture indirectly. The distal platform subdomain of the AP-2 β2 subunit appendage is a privileged CLASP-binding surface that recognizes a cognate, short α-helical interaction motif. This signal, found in the CLASPs β-arrestin and the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH) protein, docks into an elongated groove on the β2 appendage platform. Tyr-888 is a critical constituent of this spatially confined β2 appendage contact interface and is phosphorylated in numerous high-throughput proteomic studies. We find that a phosphomimetic Y888E substitution does not interfere with incorporation of expressed β2-YFP subunit into AP-2 or alter AP-2 deposition at surface clathrin-coated structures. The Y888E mutation does not affect interactions involving the sandwich subdomain of the β2 appendage, indicating that the mutated appendage is folded and operational. However, the Y888E, but not Y888F, switch selectively uncouples interactions with ARH and β-arrestin. Phyogenetic conservation of Tyr-888 suggests that this residue can reversibly control occupancy of the β2 platform-binding site and, hence, cargo sorting."
