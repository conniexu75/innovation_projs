The reaction, which often requires precious metal catalysts, couples ammonia or other amines with carbonyl compounds and then with hydrogen. Jagadeesh et al. report a class of nonprecious cobalt nanoparticles that catalyze this reaction across a very broad range of substrates, including complex molecules of pharmaceutical interest (see the Perspective by Chen and Xu). The cobalt was first embedded in a metal-organic framework (MOF), which, upon heating, transformed into a graphitic shell. The catalyst could be conveniently separated from products and recycled up to six times. Science , this issue p. 326 ; see also p. 304"

https://openalex.org/W2758761383,"Neuronal inflammation is the characteristic pathologic change of acute neurologic impairment and chronic traumatic encephalopathy after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Inhibiting the excessive inflammatory response is essential for improving the neurologic outcome. To clarify the regulatory mechanism of microglial exosomes on neuronal inflammation in TBI, we focused on studying the impact of microglial exosomal miRNAs on injured neurons in this research. We used a repetitive (r)TBI mouse model and harvested the injured brain extracts from the acute to the chronic phase of TBI to treat cultured BV2 microglia in vitro The microglial exosomes were collected for miRNA microarray analysis, which showed that the expression level of miR-124-3p increased most apparently in the miRNAs. We found that miR-124-3p promoted the anti-inflamed M2 polarization in microglia, and microglial exosomal miR-124-3p inhibited neuronal inflammation in scratch-injured neurons. Further, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling was implicated as being involved in the regulation of miR-124-3p by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. Using the mTOR activator MHY1485 we confirmed that the inhibitory effect of exosomal miR-124-3p on neuronal inflammation was exerted by suppressing the activity of mTOR signaling. PDE4B was predicted to be the target gene of miR-124-3p by pathway analysis. We proved that it was directly targeted by miR-124-3p with a luciferase reporter assay. Using a PDE4B overexpressed lentivirus transfection system, we suggested that miR-124-3p suppressed the activity of mTOR signaling mainly through inhibiting the expression of PDE4B. In addition, exosomal miR-124-3p promoted neurite outgrowth after scratch injury, characterized by an increase on the number of neurite branches and total neurite length, and a decreased expression on RhoA and neurodegenerative proteins [Aβ-peptide and p-Tau]. It also improved the neurologic outcome and inhibited neuroinflammation in mice with rTBI. Taken together, increased miR-124-3p in microglial exosomes after TBI can inhibit neuronal inflammation and contribute to neurite outgrowth via their transfer into neurons. miR-124-3p exerted these effects by targeting PDE4B, thus inhibiting the activity of mTOR signaling. Therefore, miR-124-3p could be a promising therapeutic target for interventions of neuronal inflammation after TBI. miRNAs manipulated microglial exosomes may provide a novel therapy for TBI and other neurologic diseases.-Huang, S., Ge, X., Yu, J., Han, Z., Yin, Z., Li, Y., Chen, F., Wang, H., Zhang, J., Lei, P. Increased miR-124-3p in microglial exosomes following traumatic brain injury inhibits neuronal inflammation and contributes to neurite outgrowth via their transfer into neurons."

Hybrid systems offer the flexibility of combining and optimizing different platforms. Hong et al. combined optomechanical control of motion and single-phonon counting techniques to probabilistically generate a single-phonon Fock state within a nanomechanical resonator.

The sources of higher-energy cosmic rays remain under debate, although we know that lower-energy cosmic rays come from the solar wind. The Pierre Auger Collaboration reports the observation of thousands of cosmic rays with ultrahigh energies of several exa–electron volts (about a Joule per particle), arriving in a slightly dipolar distribution (see the Perspective by Gallagher and Halzen). The direction of the rays indicates that the particles originated in other galaxies and not from nearby sources within our own Milky Way Galaxy. Science , this issue p. 1266 ; see also p. 1240"
https://openalex.org/W2603417611,"It has recently become possible to study the dynamics of information diffusion in techno-social systems at scale, due to the emergence of online platforms, such as Twitter, with millions of users. One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using `social bots' deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques."

https://openalex.org/W3102434599,Nano- and micromechanical solid-state quantum devices have become a focus of attention. Reliably generating nonclassical states of their motion is of interest both for addressing fundamental questions about macroscopic quantum phenomena and for developing quantum technologies in the domains of sensing and transduction. We used quantum optical control techniques to conditionally generate single-phonon Fock states of a nanomechanical resonator. We performed a Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type experiment that verified the nonclassical nature of the phonon state without requiring full state reconstruction. Our result establishes purely optical quantum control of a mechanical oscillator at the single-phonon level.

GCs are separated into two anatomic compartments: the dark zone, where B cells divide and undergo somatic hypermutation, and the light zone, where they are selected for affinity-enhancing mutations after interacting with T follicular helper cells. Mayer et al. studied apoptosis reporter mice and found that both GC zones experience very high rates of apoptosis (see the Perspective by Bryant and Hodgkin). However, the underlying mechanisms were distinct and microanatomically segregated. Light-zo ne B cells underwent apoptosis by default unless they were rescued by positive selection. In contrast, apoptotic dark-zone B cells were highly enriched among cells with genes damaged by random antibody-gene mutations. Science , this issue p. eaao2602 ; see also p. 171"

Rosas et al. present a more complete skeleton of a Neandertal child, aged 7 to 8 years, from a 49,000-year-old site in northern Spain. The skeleton preserves dental, cranial, and postcranial material, allowing the assessment of dental and skeletal maturation with age. Most of the elements indicate an overall growth rate similar to that of modern human children. The main difference between Neandertals and modern humans is in the vertebral column. Also, several features indicate ongoing brain growth. The pattern of vertebral maturation and extended brain growth might reflect the broad Neandertal body form and physiology, rather than a fundamental difference in the overall pace of growth in Neandertals.

https://openalex.org/W2757874772,"Overexpression or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 has been shown to extend the lifespan of mice and protect against aging-related diseases. Here we show that pharmacological activation of SIRT1 protects in two models of osteoporosis. Ovariectomized female mice and aged male mice, models for post-menopausal and aging-related osteoporosis, respectively, show significant improvements in bone mass upon treatment with SIRT1 agonist, SRT1720. Further, we find that calorie restriction (CR) results in a two-fold upregulation of sirt1 mRNA expression in bone tissue that is associated with increased bone mass in CR mice. Reciprocally, SIRT1 whole-body knockout (KO) mice, as well as osteoblast and osteoclast specific KOs, show a low bone mass phenotype; though double knockout mice (containing SIRT1 deleted in both osteoblasts and osteoclasts) do not show a more severe phenotype. Altogether, these findings provide strong evidence that SIRT1 is a positive regulator of bone mass and a promising target for the development of novel therapeutics for osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W2759916106,"In vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy provides insight into metabolism in the human body. New acquisition protocols are often proposed to improve the quality or efficiency of data collection. Processing pipelines must also be developed to use these data optimally. Current fitting software is either targeted at general spectroscopy fitting, or for specific protocols. We therefore introduce the MATLAB-based OXford Spectroscopy Analysis (OXSA) toolbox to allow researchers to rapidly develop their own customised processing pipelines. The toolbox aims to simplify development by: being easy to install and use; seamlessly importing Siemens Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) standard data; allowing visualisation of spectroscopy data; offering a robust fitting routine; flexibly specifying prior knowledge when fitting; and allowing batch processing of spectra. This article demonstrates how each of these criteria have been fulfilled, and gives technical details about the implementation in MATLAB.

Personality traits are embedded early in life and remain relatively stable, whereas grit (at least the passion component) may come and go and thus be malleable. Leonard et al. show that infants can learn from adults to persist through failure at arduous tasks (see the Perspective by Butler).

The frogs, however, run the risk of intoxicating themselves. Studying the frog neurotoxin epibatidine, which binds to acetylcholine receptors, Tarvin et al. found a single amino acid substitution. The substitution changes the configuration of the acetylcholine receptor, so that it decreases its sensitivity to the toxin. But acetylcholine signaling is essential for normal life. Expressing frog receptors in human cells revealed that different amino acid substitutions have occurred in different lineages that allow the frog to resist its own toxins while still letting target neurotransmitters function effectively.

https://openalex.org/W2757152285,"In our previous studies we showed that in breast cancer podoplanin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts correlated positively with tumor size, grade of malignancy, lymph node metastasis, lymphovascular invasion and poor patients' outcome. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to assess if podoplanin expressed by fibroblasts can affect malignancy-associated properties of breast cancer cells. Human fibroblastic cell lines (MSU1.1 and Hs 578Bst) overexpressing podoplanin and control fibroblasts were co-cultured with breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cells and the impact of podoplanin expressed by fibroblasts on migration and invasiveness of breast cancer cells were studied in vitro. Migratory and invasive properties of breast cancer cells were not affected by the presence of podoplanin on the surface of fibroblasts. However, ectopic expression of podoplanin highly increases the migration of MSU1.1 and Hs 578Bst fibroblasts. The present study also revealed for the first time, that podoplanin expression affects the formation of pseudo tubes by endothelial cells. When human HSkMEC cells were co-cultured with podoplanin-rich fibroblasts the endothelial cell capillary-like network was characterized by significantly lower numbers of nodes and meshes than in co-cultures of endothelial cells with podoplanin-negative fibroblasts. The question remains as to how our experimental data can be correlated with previous clinical data showing an association between the presence of podoplanin-positive cancer-associated fibroblasts and progression of breast cancer. Therefore, we propose that expression of podoplanin by fibroblasts facilitates their movement into the tumor stroma, which creates a favorable microenvironment for tumor progression by increasing the number of cancer-associated fibroblasts, which produce numerous factors affecting proliferation, survival and invasion of cancer cells. In accordance with this, the present study revealed for the first time, that such podoplanin-mediated effects can affect tube formation by endothelial cells and participate in their pathological properties in the tumor context. Our experimental data were supported by clinical studies. First, when IDC and DCIS were analyzed by immunohistochemistry according to the presence of podoplanin-expressing cells, the numbers of cancer-associated fibroblasts with high expression of this glycoprotein were significantly higher in IDC than in DCIS cases. Second, using immunofluorescence, the co-localization of PDPN-positive CAFs with blood vessels stained with antibody directed against CD34 was observed in tumor stroma of IDC samples."
https://openalex.org/W2756591964,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a rapidly progressive brain cancer that exploits the neural microenvironment, and particularly blood vessels, for selective growth and survival. Anti-angiogenic agents such as the vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) blocking antibody bevacizumab yield short-term benefits to patients due to blood vessel regression and stabilization of vascular permeability. However, tumor recurrence is common, and this is associated with acquired resistance to bevacizumab. The mechanisms that drive acquired resistance and tumor recurrence in response to anti-angiogenic therapy remain largely unknown. Here, we report that Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) regulates GBM growth and invasion by balancing tumor cell responses to VEGF-A and transforming growth factor βs (TGFβs). Nrp1 is expressed in GBM cells where it promotes TGFβ receptor internalization and signaling via Smad transcription factors. GBM that recur after bevacizumab treatment show down-regulation of Nrp1 expression, indicating that altering the balance between VEGF-A and TGFβ signaling is one mechanism that promotes resistance to anti-angiogenic agents. Collectively, these data reveal that Nrp1 plays a critical role in balancing responsiveness to VEGF-A versus TGFβ to regulate GBM growth, progression, and recurrence after anti-vascular therapy."

It thrives in moist places where it forms biofilms that are exceedingly difficult to eradicate on hospital surfaces, in water supplies and implanted biomaterials. Using a live cell SELEX approach we selected DNA aptamers to P. aeruginosa grown as biofilms in microfluidic cells. From a pool of aptamer candidates showing tight binding a stem-loop structure was identified as being important for binding. Enhanced binding and increased specificity was achieved by truncating structures and generating chimeric aptamers from the pool of top candidates. The top candidates have low nanomolar binding constants and high discrimination for P. aeruginosa over other Gram-negative bacteria. The aptamers bind both planktonic grown and biofilm grown cells. They do not have intrinsic bacteriostatic or bactericidal activity, but are ideal candidates for modification for use as aptamer-drug conjugates and in biosensors."
https://openalex.org/W2756926516,"Objectives Dysregulation of miRNAs and their target genes contributes to the pathophysiology of autoimmune diseases. Circulating miRNAs may serve as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers. We aimed to investigate the association between circulating miRNAs, disease activity and spinal involvement in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (AxSpA). Methods Total RNA was isolated from the plasma of patients with non-radiographic (nr)AxSpA, patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and healthy controls (HC) via phenol-chloroform extraction. A total of 760 miRNAs were analysed with TaqMan® Low Density Arrays, and the expression of 21 miRNAs was assessed using single assays. Results Comprehensive analysis demonstrated the differential expression of miRNAs among patients with progressive spinal disease. Of the 21 miRNAs selected according to their expression patterns, the levels of miR-625-3p were significantly different between nr-AxSpA patients and HCs. We found no correlation between miRNA levels and Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) in nr-AxSpA patients. Selected miRNAs, such as miR-29a-3p, miR-146a-5p or miR-222-3p with an established role in extracellular matrix formation and inflammation were associated with spinal changes and/or disease activity assessed by BASDAI in AS patients, including miR-625-3p reflecting disease activity in AS with spinal involvement. Conclusions Our data indicate that circulating miRNAs play a role in the pathogenesis of AxSpA and are also suggestive of their potential as biomarkers of disease progression. We hypothesize that differential systemic levels of miRNA expression reflect miRNA dysregulation at sites of spinal inflammation or bone formation where these molecules contribute to the development of pathophysiological features typical of AxSpA."
https://openalex.org/W2756811650,"Osteoblasts express two key molecules for osteoclast differentiation, receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble decoy receptor for RANKL. RANKL induces osteoclastogenesis, while OPG inhibits it by blocking the binding of RANKL to RANK, a cellular receptor of RANKL. OPG-deficient (OPG-/-) mice exhibit severe alveolar bone loss with enhanced bone resorption. WP9QY (W9) peptide binds to RANKL and blocks RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. W9 is also reported to stimulate bone formation in vivo. Here, we show that treatment with W9 restores alveolar bone loss in OPG-/-mice by suppressing osteoclastogenesis and enhancing osteoblastogenesis. Administration of W9 or risedronate, a bisphosphonate, to OPG-/-mice significantly decreased the osteoclast number in the alveolar bone. Interestingly, treatment with W9, but not risedronate, enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling and induced alveolar bone formation in OPG-/-mice. Expression of sclerostin, an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, was significantly lower in tibiae of OPG-/-mice than in wild-type mice. Treatment with risedronate recovered sclerostin expression in OPG-/-mice, while W9 treatment further suppressed sclerostin expression. Histomorphometric analysis confirmed that bone formation-related parameters in OPG-/-mice, such as osteoblast number, osteoblast surface and osteoid surface, were increased by W9 administration but not by risedronate administration. These results suggest that treatment of OPG-/-mice with W9 suppressed osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting RANKL signaling and enhanced osteoblastogenesis by attenuating sclerostin expression in the alveolar bone. Taken together, W9 may be a useful drug to prevent alveolar bone loss in periodontitis."

We previously reported that sonoporation with microbubbles (MBs) could achieve effective intracellular drug delivery to human gingival squamous carcinoma Ca9-22 cells. In this study, we developed anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibody-conjugated MBs (EGFR-MBs) and evaluated their capacity to enhance anti-cancer drug toxicity in vitro and in vivo. We first assessed the effect of sonoporation with EGFR-MBs on Ca9-22 cells by the WST-8 assay, flow cytometry and Hoechst’s staining in vitro. Sonoporation and EGFR-MB had a strong cytotoxic effect on Ca9-22 cells with low-dose bleomycin. Furthermore, bleomycin delivery using sonoporation with EGFR-MBs remarkably increased the number of apoptotic cells. We next examined the effect of EGFR-MBs in a murine squamous cell carcinoma model. Bleomycin delivery by sonoporation with EGFR-MBs exhibited remarkable antitumor activity. Together, our results show that EGFR-MBs and ultrasound treatment increases the efficacy and specificity of intracellular drug uptake, suggesting this could be a novel drug-targeting modality for oral squamous cell carcinoma chemotherapy treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2757818434,"Otodontids include some of the largest macropredatory sharks that ever lived, the most extreme case being Otodus (Megaselachus) megalodon. The reasons underlying their gigantism, distribution patterns and extinction have been classically linked with climatic factors and the evolution, radiation and migrations of cetaceans during the Paleogene. However, most of these previous proposals are based on the idea of otodontids as ectothermic sharks regardless of the ecological, energetic and body size constraints that this implies. Interestingly, a few recent studies have suggested the possible existence of endothermy in these sharks thus opening the door to a series of new interpretations. Accordingly, this work proposes that regional endothermy was present in otodontids and some closely related taxa (cretoxyrhinids), playing an important role in the evolution of gigantism and in allowing an active mode of live. The existence of regional endothermy in these groups is supported here by three different approaches including isotopic-based approximations, swimming speed inferences and the application of a novel methodology for assessing energetic budget and cost of swimming in extinct taxa. In addition, this finding has wider implications. It calls into question some previous paleotemperature estimates based partially on these taxa, suggests that the existing hypothesis about the evolution of regional endothermy in fishes requires modification, and provides key evidence for understanding the evolution of gigantism in active macropredators."

https://openalex.org/W2758384014,"The annexins are a family of Ca2+-regulated phospholipid binding proteins that are involved in membrane domain organization and membrane trafficking. Although they are widely studied and crystal structures are available for several soluble annexins their mode of membrane association has never been studied at the molecular level. Here we obtained molecular information on the annexin-membrane interaction that could serve as paradigm for the peripheral membrane association of cytosolic proteins by Molecular Dynamics simulations. We analyzed systems containing the monomeric annexin A2 (AnxA2), a membrane with negatively charged phosphatidylserine (POPS) lipids as well as Ca2+ ions. On the atomic level we identify the AnxA2 orientations and the respective residues which display the strongest interaction with Ca2+ ions and the membrane. The simulation results fully agree with earlier experimental findings concerning the positioning of bound Ca2+ ions. Furthermore, we identify for the first time a significant interaction between lysine residues of the protein and POPS lipids that occurs independently of Ca2+ suggesting that AnxA2-membrane interactions can also occur in a low Ca2+ environment. Finally, by varying Ca2+ concentrations and lipid composition in our simulations we observe a calcium-induced negative curvature of the membrane as well as an AnxA2-induced lipid ordering."

Culex (Melanoconion) pedroi, a major Venezuelan equine encephalitis vector was relatively rare (< 2.0% of all sampled mosquitoes). We also found Cx. (Mel) adamesi, Cx. (Mel) crybda, Cx. (Mel) ocossa, Cx. (Mel) spissipes, Cx. (Mel) taeniopus, Cx. (Mel) vomerifer, Aedes scapularis, Ae. angustivittatus, Coquillettidia venezuelensis, Cx. nigripalpus, Cx. declarator, Mansonia titillans, M. pseudotitillans and Psorophora ferox all species known to be vectorially competent for the transmission of arboviruses. Abundance and diversity of mosquitoes in the sampled locations was high, when compared with similar surveys in temperate areas. Information from previous reports about vectorial competence / capacity of the sampled mosquito species suggest that sampled locations have all the elements to support enzootic outbreaks of Venezuelan and Eastern equine encephalitides."

https://openalex.org/W2759947783,"Biomass gasification stations are facing many hazard factors, therefore, it is necessary to make hazard assessment for them. In this study, a novel hazard assessment method called extended set pair analysis (ESPA) is proposed based on set pair analysis (SPA). However, the calculation of the connection degree (CD) requires the classification of hazard grades and their corresponding thresholds using SPA for the hazard assessment. In regard to the hazard assessment using ESPA, a novel calculation algorithm of the CD is worked out when hazard grades and their corresponding thresholds are unknown. Then the CD can be converted into Euclidean distance (ED) by a simple and concise calculation, and the hazard of each sample will be ranked based on the value of ED. In this paper, six biomass gasification stations are introduced to make hazard assessment using ESPA and general set pair analysis (GSPA), respectively. By the comparison of hazard assessment results obtained from ESPA and GSPA, the availability and validity of ESPA can be proved in the hazard assessment for biomass gasification stations. Meanwhile, the reasonability of ESPA is also justified by the sensitivity analysis of hazard assessment results obtained by ESPA and GSPA."
https://openalex.org/W2757686569,"Invasive cancer cells develop small actin-based protrusions called invadopodia, which perform a primordial role in metastasis and extracellular matrix remodelling. Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASp) is a scaffold protein which can directly bind to actin monomers and Arp2/3 and is a crucial player in the formation of an invadopodium precursor. Expression modulation has pointed to an important role for N-WASp in invadopodium formation but the role of its C-terminal VCA domain in this process remains unknown. In this study, we generated alpaca nanobodies against the N-WASp VCA domain and investigated if these nanobodies affect invadopodium formation. By using this approach, we were able to study functions of a selected functional/structural N-WASp protein domain in living cells, without requiring overexpression, dominant negative mutants or siRNAs which target the gene, and hence the entire protein. When expressed as intrabodies, the VCA nanobodies significantly reduced invadopodium formation in both MDA-MB-231 breast cancer and HNSCC61 head and neck squamous cancer cells. Furthermore, expression of distinct VCA Nbs (VCA Nb7 and VCA Nb14) in PC-3 prostate cancer cells resulted in reduced overall matrix degradation without affecting MMP9 secretion/activation or MT1-MMP localisation at invadopodial membranes. From these results, we conclude that we have generated nanobodies targeting N-WASp which reduce invadopodium formation and functioning, most likely via regulation of N-WASp-Arp2/3 complex interaction, indicating that this region of N-WASp plays an important role in these processes."

https://openalex.org/W2757624129,"Many proteins work together with others in groups called complexes in order to achieve a specific function. Discovering protein complexes is important for understanding biological processes and predict protein functions in living organisms. Large-scale and throughput techniques have made possible to compile protein-protein interaction networks (PPI networks), which have been used in several computational approaches for detecting protein complexes. Those predictions might guide future biologic experimental research. Some approaches are topology-based, where highly connected proteins are predicted to be complexes; some propose different clustering algorithms using partitioning, overlaps among clusters for networks modeled with unweighted or weighted graphs; and others use density of clusters and information based on protein functionality. However, some schemes still require much processing time or the quality of their results can be improved. Furthermore, most of the results obtained with computational tools are not accompanied by an analysis of false positives. We propose an effective and efficient mining algorithm for discovering highly connected subgraphs, which is our base for defining protein complexes. Our representation is based on transforming the PPI network into a directed acyclic graph that reduces the number of represented edges and the search space for discovering subgraphs. Our approach considers weighted and unweighted PPI networks. We compare our best alternative using PPI networks from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) and Homo sapiens (human) with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of clustering, biological metrics and execution times, as well as three gold standards for yeast and two for human. Furthermore, we analyze false positive predicted complexes searching the PDBe (Protein Data Bank in Europe) database in order to identify matching protein complexes that have been purified and structurally characterized. Our analysis shows that more than 50 yeast protein complexes and more than 300 human protein complexes found to be false positives according to our prediction method, i.e., not described in the gold standard complex databases, in fact contain protein complexes that have been characterized structurally and documented in PDBe. We also found that some of these protein complexes have recently been classified as part of a Periodic Table of Protein Complexes.

https://openalex.org/W2759274657,"Strain SYK-6 of the bacterium Sphingobium sp. catabolizes lignin-derived biphenyl via a meta-cleavage pathway. In this pathway, LigY is proposed to catalyze the hydrolysis of the meta-cleavage product (MCP) 4,11-dicarboxy-8-hydroxy-9-methoxy-2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-hexa-2,4-dienoate. Here, we validated this reaction by identifying 5-carboxyvanillate and 4-carboxy-2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate as the products and determined the kcat and kcat/Km values as 9.3 ± 0.6 s−1 and 2.5 ± 0.2 × 107 m−1 s−1, respectively. Sequence analyses and a 1.9 Å resolution crystal structure established that LigY belongs to the amidohydrolase superfamily, unlike previously characterized MCP hydrolases, which are serine-dependent enzymes of the α/β-hydrolase superfamily. The active-site architecture of LigY resembled that of α-amino-β-carboxymuconic-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase, a class III amidohydrolase, with a single zinc ion coordinated by His-6, His-8, His-179, and Glu-282. Interestingly, we found that LigY lacks the acidic residue proposed to activate water for hydrolysis in other class III amidohydrolases. Moreover, substitution of His-223, a conserved residue proposed to activate water in other amidohydrolases, reduced the kcat to a much lesser extent than what has been reported for other amidohydrolases, suggesting that His-223 has a different role in LigY. Substitution of Arg-72, Tyr-190, Arg-234, or Glu-282 reduced LigY activity over 100-fold. On the basis of these results, we propose a catalytic mechanism involving substrate tautomerization, substrate-assisted activation of water for hydrolysis, and formation of a gem-diol intermediate. This last step diverges from what occurs in serine-dependent MCP hydrolases. This study provides insight into C–C–hydrolyzing enzymes and expands the known range of reactions catalyzed by the amidohydrolase superfamily.

https://openalex.org/W2757768460,"Nosiheptide (NOS), a typical member of the thiopeptides, possesses strong activities against multidrug-resistant, gram-positive bacterial pathogens. Similar to other thiopeptides, the biosynthetic pathway of NOS belongs to a ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified peptide system. Bioinformatics analysis of the NOS gene cluster suggests that nosP gene encodes a homologous protein of the Streptomyces antibiotic regulatory protein (SARP) family. In the present study, the actual initiation codon of nosP was identified by comparison of potential initiation codons GUG and AUG. In contrast to previous predictions of starting with GUG, AUG, corresponding to methionine residue as the 53rd residue in the original sequence, is actually the initiation codon of nosP, indicating that a truncated form of NosP (NosP53-323) is a functional protein. For better understanding of the transcriptional regulation for NOS biosynthesis, the binding region was subsequently investigated with NosP53-323, demonstrating that NosP53-323 specifically binds the bidirectional nosL-nosM promoter region. Additionally, NosP53-323 was confirmed to serve as a transcription factor to activate the transcription of all 15 structural genes in the gene cluster. The present study provides new insights into pathway-specific regulation of the biosynthesis of NOS, which would be beneficial to the investigation of the regulatory function of similar SARP proteins in the gene clusters of other thiopeptides.-Wu, X., Jin, L., Zhang, H., Tong, R., Ma, M., Chen, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2756802234,"Serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 3 (SGK3) is a downstream mediator of PI3K, which is essential for maintaining the functional integrity of podocytes. However, little is known about the role of SGK3 in podocyte function. Herein, we demonstrated that SGK3 contributes to the maintenance of podocyte integrity. Conditionally immortalized mouse podocyte cells (MPCs) were treated with puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). PAN treatment inhibited the activity of SGK3 and the expression of podocin. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of SGK3 also reduced podocin expression in the absence of PAN. Adriamycin (ADR)-treated mice developed proteinuria and had decreased renal glomerular SGK3 expression in comparison to control mice. Consistent with a role for SGK3 in the ADR effect, SGK3 knockout (KO) mice had markedly reduced kidney podocin expression and significantly elevated proteinuria compared with wild-type mice. Electron microscopy revealed that SGK3 KO mice displayed partial effacement of podocyte foot processes. Further, a SGK3 target protein, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3), was discovered to be dramatically activated in PAN and SGK3 shRNA-treated MPCs and in SGK3 KO mice. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that SGK3 plays a significant role in regulating podocyte function, likely by controlling the expression and activity of GSK3.—Peng, L.-Q., Zhao, H., Liu, S., Yuan, Y.-P., Yuan, C.-Y., Mwamunyi, M.-J., Pearce, D., Yao, L.-J.

https://openalex.org/W2758254351,"Background Currently, the rat has been a useful animal model in brain stimulation research. Nevertheless, extrapolating results from rodent repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) research to humans contains several hurdles. This suggests the desperate need for a large animal model in translational rTMS research. The dog would be a valid choice, not only due to the fact that humans and dogs share a neurophysiological background, but a similar neuropathological background as well. Hypothesis In order to evaluate the feasibility of the canine rTMS animal model, this study aimed to evaluate the neurophysiological response in dogs on a, clinically used, accelerated high frequency (aHF) rTMS protocol. This aHF-rTMS (20 Hz) protocol was performed under anaesthesia or sedation and either 20 sessions or 5 sessions were given to each dog. Methods 21 healthy dogs were randomly subjected to one of the four aHF-rTMS protocols (1 sham and 3 active protocols). For each dog, the perfusion indices (PI), of a [99mTc]HMPAO scan at 4 time points, for the left frontal cortex (stimulation target) were calculated for each protocol. Results Concerning sham stimulation, the average PI remained at the baseline level. The main result was the presence of a direct transitory increase in rCBF at the stimulation site, both under anaesthesia and sedation. Nevertheless the measured increase in rCBF was higher but shorter duration under sedation. The magnitude of this increase was not influenced by number of sessions. No changes in rCBF were found in remote brain regions. Conclusion This study shows that, despite the influence of anaesthesia and sedation, comparable and clinically relevant effects on the rCBF can be obtained in dogs. Since less methodological hurdles have to be overcome and comparable results can be obtained, it would be acceptable to put the dog forward as an alternative translational rTMS animal model."

Between 1996-2014, 11 801 HIV patients accessing therapy in British Columbia were observed longitudinally. A subset of 9456 patients had testable viral load; of these 8398 were linked to census data. Sociodemographic (census tract-level) and clinical (individual-level) correlates of DRT were assessed using multivariable General Estimating Equation logistic regression adjusted odds ratios (aOR). The mean number of tests per patient was 2.1 (Q1-Q3; 0-3). Separately, any drug resistance was determined using IAS-USA (2013) list for 5703 initially treatment naïve patients without baseline resistance; 5175 were census-linked (mean of 1.5 protease-reverse transcriptase sequences/patient, Q1-Q3; 0-2). Correlates of detecting drug resistance in this subset were analyzed using Cox PH regression adjusted hazard ratios (aHR). Our results indicate baseline CD4 <200 cells/μL (aOR: 1.5, 1.3-1.6), nRTI-only baseline regimens (aOR: 1.4, 1.3-1.6), and unknown (therapy initiation before routine pVL in BC) baseline pVL (aOR: 1.8, 1.5-2.1) were among individual-level clinical covariates strongly associated with having accessed DRT; while imperfect adherence (aHR: 2.2, 1.9-2.5), low baseline CD4 count (aHR: 1.9, 1.6-2.3), and high baseline pVL (aHR: 2.0, 1.6-2.6) were associated with a higher likelihood of developing drug resistance. A higher median income (aOR: 0.83, 0.77-0.89) and higher percentage of those with aboriginal ancestry (aOR: 0.85, 0.76-0.95) were census tract-level sociodemographic covariates associated with decreased access to DRT. Similarly, aboriginal ancestry (aHR: 1.2, 1.1-1.5) was associated with development of drug resistance. In conclusion, clinical covariates continue to be the strongest correlates of development of drug resistance and access to DRT for individuals. Regions of high median income and high aboriginal ancestry were weak census-level sociodemographic indicators of reduced DRT uptake, however high aboriginal ancestry was the only sociodemographic indicator for development of drug resistance."

The new experiments are also a first test of the United Kingdom9s carefully crafted embryo-editing research regulations, which require that researchers undergo a review by a government authority and receive a license before moving forward. Kathy Niakan, a developmental biologist at the Francis Crick Institute in London, applied in 2015 to use the CRISPR editing technique on human embryos to learn more about the genes active in early development. The researchers planned to focus first on OCT4, known as a marker for pluripotent stem cells—cells that can become all tissues in the body. Niakan9s group used CRISPR to knock out, or deactivate, the gene that codes for OCT4 in 37 single-cell human embryos left over after in vitro fertilization treatments and donated by couples. In the human embryo knockouts, placental cells failed to form, indicating that OCT4 plays an earlier role in humans than it does in mouse embryos."
