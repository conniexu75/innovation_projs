https://openalex.org/W3157263169,"COVID-19, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, can result in acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure1-4, but little is known about its pathophysiology. Here we generated single-cell atlases of 24 lung, 16 kidney, 16 liver and 19 heart autopsy tissue samples and spatial atlases of 14 lung samples from donors who died of COVID-19. Integrated computational analysis uncovered substantial remodelling in the lung epithelial, immune and stromal compartments, with evidence of multiple paths of failed tissue regeneration, including defective alveolar type 2 differentiation and expansion of fibroblasts and putative TP63+ intrapulmonary basal-like progenitor cells. Viral RNAs were enriched in mononuclear phagocytic and endothelial lung cells, which induced specific host programs. Spatial analysis in lung distinguished inflammatory host responses in lung regions with and without viral RNA. Analysis of the other tissue atlases showed transcriptional alterations in multiple cell types in heart tissue from donors with COVID-19, and mapped cell types and genes implicated with disease severity based on COVID-19 genome-wide association studies. Our foundational dataset elucidates the biological effect of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection across the body, a key step towards new treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3159762970,"Respiratory failure is the leading cause of death in patients with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection1,2, but the host response at the lung tissue level is poorly understood. Here we performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing of about 116,000 nuclei from the lungs of nineteen individuals who died of COVID-19 and underwent rapid autopsy and seven control individuals. Integrated analyses identified substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, thereby providing insight into the biology of lethal COVID-19. The lungs from individuals with COVID-19 were highly inflamed, with dense infiltration of aberrantly activated monocyte-derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages, but had impaired T cell responses. Monocyte/macrophage-derived interleukin-1β and epithelial cell-derived interleukin-6 were unique features of SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to other viral and bacterial causes of pneumonia. Alveolar type 2 cells adopted an inflammation-associated transient progenitor cell state and failed to undergo full transition into alveolar type 1 cells, resulting in impaired lung regeneration. Furthermore, we identified expansion of recently described CTHRC1+ pathological fibroblasts3 contributing to rapidly ensuing pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19. Inference of protein activity and ligand-receptor interactions identified putative drug targets to disrupt deleterious circuits. This atlas enables the dissection of lethal COVID-19, may inform our understanding of long-term complications of COVID-19 survivors, and provides an important resource for therapeutic development."
https://openalex.org/W3157186248,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the spread of tau pathology throughout the cerebral cortex. This spreading pattern was thought to be fairly consistent across individuals, although recent work has demonstrated substantial variability in the population with AD. Using tau-positron emission tomography scans from 1,612 individuals, we identified 4 distinct spatiotemporal trajectories of tau pathology, ranging in prevalence from 18 to 33%. We replicated previously described limbic-predominant and medial temporal lobe-sparing patterns, while also discovering posterior and lateral temporal patterns resembling atypical clinical variants of AD. These 'subtypes' were stable during longitudinal follow-up and were replicated in a separate sample using a different radiotracer. The subtypes presented with distinct demographic and cognitive profiles and differing longitudinal outcomes. Additionally, network diffusion models implied that pathology originates and spreads through distinct corticolimbic networks in the different subtypes. Together, our results suggest that variation in tau pathology is common and systematic, perhaps warranting a re-examination of the notion of 'typical AD' and a revisiting of tau pathological staging."
https://openalex.org/W3157264684,"In-person schooling has proved contentious and difficult to study throughout the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. Data from a massive online survey in the United States indicate an increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes among respondents living with a child attending school in person. School-based mitigation measures are associated with significant reductions in risk, particularly daily symptoms screens, teacher masking, and closure of extracurricular activities. A positive association between in-person schooling and COVID-19 outcomes persists at low levels of mitigation, but when seven or more mitigation measures are reported, a significant relationship is no longer observed. Among teachers, working outside the home was associated with an increase in COVID-19-related outcomes, but this association is similar to that observed in other occupations (e.g., health care or office work). Although in-person schooling is associated with household COVID-19 risk, this risk can likely be controlled with properly implemented school-based mitigation measures."
https://openalex.org/W3157464029,"Although almost all mycobacterial species are saprophytic environmental organisms, a few, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have evolved to cause transmissible human infection. By analyzing the recent emergence and spread of the environmental organism M. abscessus through the global cystic fibrosis population, we have defined key, generalizable steps involved in the pathogenic evolution of mycobacteria. We show that epigenetic modifiers, acquired through horizontal gene transfer, cause saltational increases in the pathogenic potential of specific environmental clones. Allopatric parallel evolution during chronic lung infection then promotes rapid increases in virulence through mutations in a discrete gene network; these mutations enhance growth within macrophages but impair fomite survival. As a consequence, we observe constrained pathogenic evolution while person-to-person transmission remains indirect, but postulate accelerated pathogenic adaptation once direct transmission is possible, as observed for M. tuberculosis Our findings indicate how key interventions, such as early treatment and cross-infection control, might restrict the spread of existing mycobacterial pathogens and prevent new, emergent ones."
https://openalex.org/W3157961382,"Ferroptosis, a form of regulated cell death triggered by lipid peroxidation, was recently identified as an important mechanism in radiotherapy (RT)-mediated tumor suppression and radioresistance, although the exact genetic contexts in which to target ferroptosis in RT remains to be defined. p53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers and a major effector to RT. Here, we identify ferroptosis as a critical mechanism to mediate p53 function in tumor radiosensitivity. Mechanistically, RT-mediated p53 activation antagonizes RT-induced SLC7A11 expression and represses glutathione synthesis, thereby promoting RT-induced lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. p53 deficiency promotes radioresistance in cancer cells or tumors at least partly through SLC7A11-mediated ferroptosis inhibition. Ferroptosis inducers (FINs) that inhibit SLC7A11 exert significant radiosensitizing effects in tumor organoids and patient-derived xenografts with p53 mutation or deficiency. Finally, we show that RT-induced ferroptosis correlates with p53 activation and better clinical outcomes to RT in cancer patients. Together, our study uncovers a previously unappreciated role of ferroptosis in p53-mediated radiosensitization and suggest using FINs in combination with RT to treat p53-mutant cancers."

Xue et al. developed ion transistors from reduced graphene oxide membranes and observed a field-enhanced diffusivity of the ions (see the Perspective by Hinds). By applying electrical gating, the average surface potential on the graphene layer could be controlled, thus altering the energy barrier for ion intercalation into the channel and leading to very high diffusion rates. The authors observed selective ion transport two orders of magnitude faster than the ion diffusion in bulk water. Science , this issue p. 501 ; see also p. 459"
https://openalex.org/W3157163067,"Accelerating ecosystem disruption Oceanic islands are among the most recent areas on Earth to have been colonized by humans, in many cases in just the past few thousand years. Therefore, they are important laboratories for the study of human impacts on natural vegetation and biodiversity. Nogué et al. provide a quantitative palaeoecological study of 27 islands around the world, focusing on pollen records of vegetation composition before and after human arrival. The authors found a consistent pattern of acceleration of vegetation turnover after human invasion, with median rates of change increasing by a factor of six. These changes occurred regardless of geographical and ecological features of the island and show how rapidly ecosystems can change and how island ecosystems are set on new trajectories.

https://openalex.org/W3157088173,"Ligands can induce G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to adopt a myriad of conformations, many of which play critical roles in determining the activation of specific signaling cascades associated with distinct functional and behavioral consequences. For example, the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is the target of classic hallucinogens, atypical antipsychotics, and psychoplastogens. However, currently available methods are inadequate for directly assessing 5-HT2AR conformation both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we developed psychLight, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor based on the 5-HT2AR structure. PsychLight detects behaviorally relevant serotonin release and correctly predicts the hallucinogenic behavioral effects of structurally similar 5-HT2AR ligands. We further used psychLight to identify a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analog, which produced rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant-like effects after a single administration. The advent of psychLight will enable in vivo detection of serotonin dynamics, early identification of designer drugs of abuse, and the development of 5-HT2AR-dependent non-hallucinogenic therapeutics."

Synergistic inhibition of WNT/β-CATENIN, protein kinase C (PKC), and SRC signaling consolidates the induction of teratoma-competent naive human PSCs, with the capacity to differentiate into trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) and extraembryonic naive endodermal (nEND) cells in vitro. Divergent signaling and transcriptional requirements for boosting naive pluripotency were found between mouse and human. P53 depletion in naive hPSCs increased their contribution to mouse-human cross-species chimeric embryos upon priming and differentiation.

Our findings set a framework for defining the signaling foundations of human naive pluripotency. Conventional human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) retain a variety of epigenetic properties that are consistent with possessing a primed pluripotent state. These include an inability to tolerate MEK/ERK inhibition (MEKi/ERKi), predominant utilization of the proximal enhancer element to maintain OCT4 expression, X-chromosome inactivation, and high levels of DNA methylation (Weinberger et al., 2016Weinberger L. Ayyash M. Novershtern N. Hanna J.H. Dynamic stem cell states: naive to primed pluripotency in rodents and humans.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2016; 17: 155-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Several groups have previously established conditions for deriving naive MEK/ERK signaling-independent genetically unmodified human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). For example, naive human stem cell medium (NHSM) conditions do not require the use of exogenous transgenes or feeder cells, maintain teratoma formation competence, and contain the following components: 2iLIF, P38i/JNKi, protein kinase C inhibitor (PKCi), ROCKi, ACTIVIN, and FGF2 (Gafni et al., 2013Gafni O. Weinberger L. Mansour A.A. Manor Y.S. Chomsky E. Ben-Yosef D. Kalma Y. Viukov S. Maza I. Zviran A. et al.Derivation of novel human ground state naive pluripotent stem cells.Nature. 2013; 504: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Under NHSM conditions, hPSCs exhibit some naive features, most notably pluripotency preservation while MEK/ERK signaling is inhibited, which is the hallmark of mammalian naive pluripotency (Takashima et al., 2014Takashima Y. Guo G. Loos R. Nichols J. Ficz G. Krueger F. Oxley D. Santos F. Clarke J.

The latter effect is profoundly weaker than the one observed in mouse pluripotent cells, suggesting sub-optimal human naive pluripotency growth conditions. Alternative conditions that generate MEK-independent human naive cells and that retain a more compelling milieu of naive transcriptional markers were developed. Several components found in NHSM (2i, PKCi, ROCKi, ACTIVIN, FGF2) were supplemented with BRAF inhibitors to generate mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-dependent naive cell lines (termed 5iLA) (Theunissen et al., 2014Theunissen T.W.

Globally, these conditions generated more pronounced downregulation in DNA methylation and upregulation of naive pluripotent cell markers. However, the hypomethylation under these conditions was accompanied by immediate and global loss of imprinting over all imprinted loci (Bar et al., 2017Bar S. Schachter M. Eldar-Geva T. Benvenisty N.

Derivation of naive hESCs in t2iL-Go (or t2iL-GoY), a combination of small molecules included within our previous NHSM transgene-free conditions (Gafni et al., 2013Gafni O. Weinberger L. Mansour A.A.

The latter is in striking difference from rodent naive PSCs, which can initiate differentiation in vivo following cell autonomous induction of the needed priming or formative capacitating signals toward differentiation (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.-L. Wray J. Nichols J. Batlle-Morera L. Doble B. Woodgett J. Cohen P. Smith A. The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2406) Google Scholar). Collectively, these prior studies suggest that none of the conditions devised so far is optimal or can reduce the gap between mouse and human naive pluripotency characteristics. In this study, we set out to devise enhanced conditions that enable the stabilization of hPSCs with stringent naive functional and molecular properties while preserving cell-autonomous differentiation competence into embryonic, germ cell and extra-embryonic lineages. This was complemented by efforts to decipher the features of signaling and regulatory circuitry of such naive PSCs. Simultaneously, we aimed to establish robust defined conditions that do not require the obligatory use of exogenous transgenes, broad histone deacytelase inhibitors or feeder cells to induce human naive pluripotency. Recent studies have defined the functional ability of 2i/LIF conditions to maintain mouse naive pluripotency upon knocking out epigenetic repressors like Mettl3 and Dnmt1 (m6A mRNA and DNA methyltransferase enzymes, respectively), while epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) differentiate and undergo apoptosis upon the complete ablation of the same factors (Geula et al., 2015Geula S. Moshitch-Moshkovitz S. Dominissini D. Mansour A.A.F. Kol N. Salmon-Divon M. Hershkovitz V. Peer E. Mor N.

Karnik R. Gu H. Ziller M.J. Clement K. Tsankov A.M. Akopian V. Gifford C.A. Donaghey J. Galonska C. et al.Targeted disruption of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B in human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). These noted functional differences led us to hypothesize that they might be utilized to screen and define the conditions that endow this stringent naive pluripotency feature (i.e., maintenance of pluripotency in the absence of defined epigenetic repressors). We engineered WIBR3 hESC lines with inducible ablation of METTL3 expression (Figures 1A and 1B ). Primed Tet-OFF-METTL3 hESCs expanded in primed conditions could not be sustained in the presence of DOX (Figure 1C). In the presence of MEFs, Tet-OFF-METTL3 could be poorly maintained in previously described NHSM conditions, but not in other previously described naive conditions (Figures 1C, S1A, and S1B). However, in the absence of MEFs, NHSM conditions also could not support the maintenance of pluripotency when METTL3 was ablated. We thus set out to test candidate molecules that may enrich NHSM conditions and allow the maintenance of Tet-OFF-METTL3 cells on DOX. We tested whether supplementing NHSM with various small molecules previously implicated in boosting naive pluripotency formation or induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derivation efficiency might achieve this goal (Figure 1D). Remarkably, adding the small molecule IWR1 enabled the expansion of Tet-OFF-METTL3 hESCs on DOX (Figure 1E). IWR1 is a WNT inhibitor (WNTi) that stabilizes the AXIN protein in the cytoplasm by inhibiting the Tankyrase enzyme (TNKi). Adding to the NHSM an independent specific TNKi, XAV939, yielded a similar effect (Figure 1F). Notably, a number of recent publications have included TNKi among other ingredients for generating naive, extended potential, or primed PSCs (Smith et al., 2012Smith Z.D. Chan M.M. Mikkelsen T.S.

However, none of these reported conditions could maintain OCT4+ in the absence of METTL3 or DNMT1 (Figures S1A and S1B), likely due to the absence of other key ingredients synergistically used in NHSM conditions but not in these previously described conditions. We used ΔPE-OCT4-GFP naive pluripotency reporter lines (Theunissen et al., 2014Theunissen T.W. Powell B.E. Wang H. Mitalipova M. Faddah D.A. Reddy J. Fan Z.P. Maetzel D. Ganz K. Shi L. et al.Systematic identification of culture conditions for induction and maintenance of naive human pluripotency.Cell Stem Cell. 2014; 15: 471-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) (Figure S1C) and found that supplementation of TNKi to NHSM conditions yielded an increase in GFP (Figures 1G and S1C). Consistent with studies conducted in mice (Kim et al., 2013Kim H. Wu J. Ye S. Tai C.-I. Zhou X. Yan H. Li P. Pera M. Ying Q.-L. Modulation of β-catenin function maintains mouse epiblast stem cell and human embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nat. Commun. 2013; 4: 2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), adding TNKi rendered exogenous supplementation of FGF2 dispensable (Figure 1G). Further, as TNKi inhibits WNT signaling, we validated that including GSK3 inhibitor (GSK3i) is dispensable and, in fact, compromises the intensity of naive ΔPE-OCT4-GFP signal (Figure S1D). Although dispensable, JNK/P38 inhibition boosted naive pluripotency marker expression and cell viability and, therefore, was included in the induction media used herein as an optional secondary booster (Figure S1E). When induced under NHSM conditions with the above modifications, hESCs maintained uniformly high ΔPE-OCT4-GFP levels only in the presence of exogenous ACTIVIN A and differentiated when transforming growth factor (TGF) receptor (TGFR) inhibitor was introduced (Figures 1H, 1I, and S1F). We employed a second targeted screening strategy in an effort to identify a small molecule whose addition to NHSM generates hPSCs without the need for exogenous ACTIVIN supplementation. To do this, candidate molecules were added to NHSM conditions supplemented with TNKi but lacking ACTIVIN A to screen for OCT4+ PSCs that are induced independently of METTL3 expression (on DOX) (Figure 2A). While in most conditions OCT4+ cell fraction rapidly deteriorated, a SRC inhibitor (SRCi = CGP77675) maintained the stability of dome-like OCT4+ cells (Figure 2B). The latter led us to assemble a defined FGF/TGF/ACTIVIN/MEF-independent and serum-free condition termed human enhanced naive stem cell medium (HENSM) (Figures 2C–2E). Supplementation of SRCi and Geltrex in ACTIVIN-A-containing media, although not essential, supported the consistency of a dome-like morphology among naive cells and boosted naive marker expression (Figures S1G and S1H) (termed HENSM-ACT). hESCs maintained their dome-like morphology and expressed naive pluripotency marker KLF17 in HENSM (Figure S2A). The cells generated mature teratomas without the need to passage them first in primed conditions prior to their injection (Figure 2F). To extend the previous findings to other repressor machineries, DGCR8 null cells were expanded in HENSM and retained expression of naive ΔPE-OCT4-GFP reporter (Figure S2B). To test which of the naive conditions enables expanding naive hPSCs in the absence of DNMT1, primed TET-OFF DNMT1 hESCs (Figure 2G) (Liao et al., 2015Liao J. Karnik R. Gu H. Ziller M.J. Clement K. Tsankov A.M. Akopian V. Gifford C.A. Donaghey J. Galonska C. et al.Targeted disruption of DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B in human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Genet. 2015; 47: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) were transferred into previously described naive conditions including NHSM, 5i/LA. t2iL-GO, and TESR/3iL-MEF and could not be maintained in the presence of DOX (Figures 2H and 2I). Strikingly, HENSM and HENSM-ACT conditions allowed stable induction, and unlimited expansion of DNMT1 depleted human OCT4+ ESCs (Figure 2I). Collectively, these results demonstrate that HENSM conditions closely mimic stringent characteristics of mouse naive ESCs and enable generation of hPSCs ablated for epigenetic repressors. As shown previously for naive hPSCs in NHSM, 5i-LA, and t2iL-Go (Sperber et al., 2015Sperber H. Mathieu J. Wang Y. Ferreccio A. Hesson J. Xu Z. Fischer K.A. Devi A. Detraux D. Gu H. et al.The metabolome regulates the epigenetic landscape during naive-to-primed human embryonic stem cell transition.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17: 1523-1535Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), HENSM conditions also increase their oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) activity (Figure S2C). A newly identified metabolic feature in naive ESCs in 2i/LIF is that they can endogenously synthesize glutamine at sufficient levels to maintain adequate alpha-ketogluterate (αKG) levels (Carey et al., 2015Carey B.W. Finley L.W.S. Cross J.R. Allis C.D. Thompson C.B. Intracellular α-ketoglutarate maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 518: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). While they benefit from exogenous L-glutamine supplementation, it is not essential for their stability, as they can endogenously synthesize it. Primed EpiSCs cannot be maintained in the absence of exogenous L-glutamine for an extended period (Carey et al., 2015Carey B.W. Finley L.W.S. Cross J.R. Allis C.D. Thompson C.B. Intracellular α-ketoglutarate maintains the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 518: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). hESC lines were then tested for the ability to induce naive pluripotency in the presence and absence of exogenously added L-glutamine (Figure 2J). We failed to maintain primed PSCs or induce naivety in previously described naive conditions in the absence of L-glutamine (Figure 2J), while cells in HENSM obtained naive pluripotency even in the absence of exogenous L-glutamine (Figure S2D). We established five new hESC lines from blastocysts (LIS36, LIS42, and LIS46 in HENSM-ACT and LIS41 and LIS49 ESCs in HENSM). Human dermal fibroblast or blood cells were reprogrammed into iPSCs in HENSM conditions. hESC and hiPSC lines expanded in HENSM conditions were positive for pluripotency markers (OCT4, NANOG, SSEA4, TRA1-60, TRA1-81, STELLA, DNMT3L, TFCP2L1, and KLF17) (Figure S2E); formed mature teratomas (Figure S2F); and differentiated, without a need for in vitro priming, directly into bona fide extra-embryonic trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) (Figure S2G) and extra-embryonic naive primitive endoderm cells (PrE and nEND cells) (Figures S2H and S2I) (Linneberg-Agerholm et al., 2019Linneberg-Agerholm M.

Naive hPSC lines were passaged with TryplE every 4–5 days and maintained robust growth (Figure S2J). Naive hPSCs maintained normal karyotype after extended passaging in HENSM-ACT or HENSM in most lines tested (Figure S2K). This indicates that epigenetic resetting in HENSM does not cause obligatory chromosomal abnormalities or select for pre-existing abnormal variants, as has been seen for other naive conditions like 5iLA-MEF or t2iL-Go (Liu et al., 2017Liu X. Nefzger C.M. Rossello F.J. Chen J. Knaupp A.S. Firas J. Ford E. Pflueger J. Paynter J.M. Chy H.S. et al.Comprehensive characterization of distinct states of human naive pluripotency generated by reprogramming.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Unbiased clustering of genome-wide expression profiles demonstrated that naive hESCs and hiPSCs possess a distinct gene expression pattern and cluster separately from primed hPSCs (Figures 3A and 3B ). Transcripts associated with naive pluripotency were significantly upregulated in naive cells, including NANOG, TFCP2L1, KLF17, KLF4, STELLA (DPPA3), DPPA5, DNMT3L, KHDC1L, and ARGFX (Figures 3C and S3A; Tables S1, S2, and S3). ESRRB, previously purported to be a regulator of human naive pluripotency (Takashima et al., 2014Takashima Y. Guo G. Loos R. Nichols J. Ficz G. Krueger F. Oxley D. Santos F. Clarke J.

Naive pluripotent cells had downregulated lineage commitment genes like T, OTX2, ZIC2, and VIM1 (Figure S3B; Table S1). When including previously published naive datasets generated in 5iLA and t2iL-Go, we note that cells generated in HENSM and HENSM-ACT conditions clustered with the latter naive conditions and not with primed samples (Figures 3A and 3B). Similar transcriptional qualities were detected in hPSCs expanded in HENSM Xeno-free (HENSM-XF conditions) on BioLaminin511-coated plates (Figure 3A). SUSD2 surface marker was expressed on all naive lines tested; however, it was meaningfully expressed on nearly 50% of human primed cell lines (Figure S3D), which provides a cautionary note regarding recent claims that it is an exclusive marker for naive PSCs (Bredenkamp et al., 2019bBredenkamp N. Stirparo G.G. Nichols J. Smith A. Guo G.

Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis confirmed the upregulation of previously identified human naive pluripotency markers Gb3/CD77 and IL6ST/CD130 in HENSM conditions, and primed pluripotency marker CD24 was downregulated (Figure S3E) (Collier et al., 2017Collier A.J.

By comparing the transcriptome to that described during early human pre-implantation development, cells expanded in HENSM and 5iLA conditions, but not primed cells, showed specific enrichment to profiles of late morula-early blastocyst-specific signature (Figure 3D). Similar to their importance in maintaining human naive pluripotency in 5i/LA conditions (Pastor et al., 2018Pastor W.A. Liu W. Chen D. Ho J. Kim R. Hunt T.J. Lukianchikov A. Liu X. Polo J.M. Jacobsen S.E. Clark A.T. TFAP2C regulates transcription in human naive pluripotency by opening enhancers.Nat. Cell Biol. 2018; 20: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), TFAP2C knockout (KO) lines showed that it is essential for naive hPSC expansion in HENSM conditions (Figure S3C). We explored change in chromatin accessibility of each condition by ATAC-seq and compared it to unique chromatin accessibility loci found in different pre-implantation stages. We compared how many of these loci show an increase or decrease in chromatin accessibility of naive compared to primed hESCs. Like in datasets generated in 5iLA-MEF and t2iL-Go-MEF, HENSM hESC chromatin accessibility corresponds more to the ICM than to earlier stages (Figure 3E). These results support the endowment of late pre-implantation like transposon expression (Table S4) and chromatin accessibility profile in PSCs expanded in HENSM conditions. We next tested whether HENSM conditions endow naive hPSCs with a pre-X-chromosome configuration. We used WIBR2 hESCs carrying knockin MECP2-tdTomato and MECP2-GFP alleles (Figure 4A) (Theunissen et al., 2016Theunissen T.W. Friedli M. He Y. Planet E. O’Neil R.C. Markoulaki S. Pontis J. Wang H.

Upon transferring the primed cells for five passages into HENSM conditions, >88% of cells expressed both fluorescent markers, consistent with reactivation of both X chromosomes. Transferring early passage cells back into primed media allowed inactivation of the X chromosome, as evident by obtaining GFP-/tdTomato+ pattern in >95% of the reprimed cells in a non-random manner (Figure 4A). Consistent with a recent report emphasizing the importance of FGFR signaling inhibition to generate cells with ability for random X inactivation (An et al., 2020An C. Feng G. Zhang J. Cao S. Wang Y. Wang N. Lu F. Zhou Q. Wang H.

We sampled naive hPSCs for DNA methylation status by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS). Lines tested displayed a profound downregulation of global methylation levels (Figures 4B and 4C), from ∼81% in primed hPSCs to ∼55% in HENSM-ACT and to ∼66% in HENSM expanded hPSCs. It has been previously shown in mouse naive conditions that rapid loss of global DNA methylation level results from a partial decrease in UHRF1 protein expression levels while maintaining DNMT1 levels (von Meyenn et al., 2016von Meyenn F. Iurlaro M. Habibi E. Liu N.Q. Salehzadeh-Yazdi A. Santos F. Petrini E. Milagre I. Yu M.

Cell. 2016; 62: 848-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In human cells expanded in HENSM, DNMT1 methyltransferase protein expression is maintained, while UHRF1 protein is partially depleted (Figure 4D), which may underlie the global downregulation in DNA methylation in HENSM conditions. Supplementing HENSM with BRAF inhibitor used in 5i/LAF conditions leads to dramatic downregulation in DNMT1 as well (Figure 2H) and might explain the immediate and global loss of imprinting seen in 5iLA conditions (Pastor et al., 2016Pastor W.A.

https://openalex.org/W3157311560,"Transient information input to the brain leads to persistent changes in synaptic circuits, contributing to the formation of memory engrams. Pre- and postsynaptic structures undergo coordinated functional and structural changes during this process, but how such changes are achieved by their component molecules remains largely unknown. We found that activated CaMKII, a central player of synaptic plasticity, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation with the NMDA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B. Due to CaMKII autophosphorylation, the condensate stably persists even after Ca2+ is removed. The selective binding of activated CaMKII with GluN2B cosegregates AMPA receptors and the synaptic adhesion molecule neuroligin into a phase-in-phase assembly. In this way, Ca2+-induced liquid-liquid phase separation of CaMKII has the potential to act as an activity-dependent mechanism to crosslink postsynaptic proteins, which may serve as a platform for synaptic reorganization associated with synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3157597116,"Personalized in vitro models for dysplasia and carcinogenesis in the pancreas have been constrained by insufficient differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into the exocrine pancreatic lineage. Here, we differentiate hPSCs into pancreatic duct-like organoids (PDLOs) with morphological, transcriptional, proteomic, and functional characteristics of human pancreatic ducts, further maturing upon transplantation into mice. PDLOs are generated from hPSCs inducibly expressing oncogenic GNAS, KRAS, or KRAS with genetic covariance of lost CDKN2A and from induced hPSCs derived from a McCune-Albright patient. Each oncogene causes a specific growth, structural, and molecular phenotype in vitro. While transplanted PDLOs with oncogenic KRAS alone form heterogenous dysplastic lesions or cancer, KRAS with CDKN2A loss develop dedifferentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. In contrast, transplanted PDLOs with mutant GNAS lead to intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia-like structures. Conclusively, PDLOs enable in vitro and in vivo studies of pancreatic plasticity, dysplasia, and cancer formation from a genetically defined background."
https://openalex.org/W3158629111,"Summary The exocrine pancreas, consisting of ducts and acini, is the site of origin of pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our understanding of the genesis and progression of human pancreatic diseases, including PDAC, is limited because of challenges in maintaining human acinar and ductal cells in culture. Here we report induction of human pluripotent stem cells toward pancreatic ductal and acinar organoids that recapitulate properties of the neonatal exocrine pancreas. Expression of the PDAC-associated oncogene GNASR201C induces cystic growth more effectively in ductal than acinar organoids, whereas KRASG12D is more effective in modeling cancer in vivo when expressed in acinar compared with ductal organoids. KRASG12D, but not GNASR201C, induces acinar-to-ductal metaplasia-like changes in culture and in vivo. We develop a renewable source of ductal and acinar organoids for modeling exocrine development and diseases and demonstrate lineage tropism and plasticity for oncogene action in the human pancreas."

The chromosomes fold as linear rods and each is composed of a series of structural domains separated by boundaries.

Intestinal organoids offer a model of self-organization as they generate stem cell zones (SCZs) of typical size even without a spatially structured environment. Here we examine processes governing the size of SCZs. We improve the viability and homogeneity of intestinal organoid cultures to enable long-term time-lapse imaging of multiple organoids in parallel. We find that SCZs are shaped by fission events under strong control of ion channel-mediated inflation and mechanosensitive Piezo-family channels. Fission occurs through stereotyped modes of dynamic behavior that differ in their coordination of budding and differentiation. Imaging and single-cell transcriptomics show that inflation drives acute stem cell differentiation and induces a stretch-responsive cell state characterized by large transcriptional changes, including upregulation of Piezo1.

General lipase inhibitors such as Palmostatin M (Palm M) block N-Ras depalmitoylation, but lack specificity and target several enzymes displaying depalmitoylase activity. Here, we describe ABD957, a potent and selective covalent inhibitor of the ABHD17 family of depalmitoylases, and show that this compound impairs N-Ras depalmitoylation in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. ABD957 produced partial effects on N-Ras palmitoylation compared with Palm M, but was much more selective across the proteome, reflecting a plasma membrane-delineated action on dynamically palmitoylated proteins. Finally, ABD957 impaired N-Ras signaling and the growth of NRAS-mutant AML cells in a manner that synergizes with MAP kinase kinase (MEK) inhibition. Our findings uncover a surprisingly restricted role for ABHD17 enzymes as regulators of the N-Ras palmitoylation cycle and suggest that ABHD17 inhibitors may have value as targeted therapies for NRAS-mutant cancers.

This study aimed to assess the exposure health risks of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. Method A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of &lt;0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. Result A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively. More than half of the respondents 237(56.7%), had reported that they didn`t have face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Among the respondents, 173(41.4%), 147(35.2%), 63(15.1%), and 65(15.6%) of the health professionals had always used gloves, medical masks, face shield, or goggles/protective glasses, and disposable gown, respectively. In this study, age between 25–34 years (AOR = 0.20), age between 35–44 years (AOR = 0.13), family size of &gt;6 (AOR = 3.77), work experience of 21–30 years (AOR = 0.01), and good handwashing habit (AOR = 0.44) were the protective factors against COVID-19. On the other hand, perception of non-exposure to COVD 19 (AOR = 9.56), and poor habit of decontamination of high touch areas (AOR = 2.52) were the risk factors associated with confirmed COVID 19 cases among health care workers. Conclusion Poor adherence to personal protective equipment use and aseptic practices during and after health care interactions with patients were identified. Strategies should be implemented to institute effective and sustainable infection control measures that protect the health care workers from COVID-19 infection."

We identify spontaneous, asynchronous activity in a Drosophila learning and memory brain region, the mushroom body. This activity declines significantly over the first week of adulthood. Moreover, this activity is generated cell-autonomously via Cacophony voltage-gated calcium channels in a single cell type, α'/β' Kenyon cells. Juvenile hormone, a crucial developmental regulator, acts transiently in α'/β' Kenyon cells during a young adult sensitive period to downregulate spontaneous activity and enable subsequent enhanced learning.

Herein we report the crucial role of MRE11 in oral cancer progression in a nuclease-independent manner and delineate its key downstream effectors including CXCR4. MRE11 expression in oral cancer samples was positively associated with tumor size, cancer stage and lymph node metastasis, and was predictive of poorer patient survival and radiotherapy resistance. MRE11 promoted cell proliferation/migration/invasion in a nuclease-independent manner but enhanced radioresistance via a nuclease-dependent pathway. The nuclease independent promotion of EMT and metastasis was mediated by RUNX2, CXCR4, AKT, and FOXA2, while CXCR4 neutralizing antibody mitigated these effects in vitro and in vivo.

Method A retrospective data regarding occurrence and antimicrobial resistance of Acinetobacter species recovered from clinical specimens referred to the national reference laboratory was extracted from microbiology laboratory data source covering a time range from 2014 to 2018. Socio-demographic characteristics and laboratory record data was analyzed using SPSS 20. Results A total of 102 strains of Acinetobacter species were analyzed from various clinical specimens. Majority of them were from pus (33.3%) followed by blood (23.5%), urine (15.6%) and body fluid (11.7%). Significant ascending trends of antimicrobial resistance was shown for meropenem (12.5% to 60.7%), ceftazidime (82.1% to 100%), ciprofloxacin (59.4% to 74.4%), ceftriaxone (87.1% to 98.6%), cefepime (80.0% to 93.3%) and pipracillin- tazobactam (67.8% to 96.3%).

https://openalex.org/W3158522740,"Anthocyanin biosynthesis is one of the most studied pathways in plants due to the important ecological role played by these compounds and the potential health benefits of anthocyanin consumption. Given the interest in identifying new genetic factors underlying anthocyanin content we studied a diverse collection of diploid potatoes by combining a genome-wide association study and pathway-based analyses. By using an expanded SNP dataset, we identified candidate genes that had not been associated with anthocyanin variation in potatoes, namely a Myb transcription factor, a Leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase gene and a vacuolar membrane protein. Importantly, a genomic region in chromosome 10 harbored the SNPs with strongest associations with anthocyanin content in GWAS. Some of these SNPs were associated with multiple anthocyanin compounds and therefore could underline the existence of pleiotropic genes or anthocyanin biosynthetic clusters. We identified multiple anthocyanin homologs in this genomic region, including four transcription factors and five enzymes that could be governing anthocyanin variation. For instance, a SNP linked to the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase gene, encoding the first enzyme in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, was associated with all of the five anthocyanins measured. Finally, we combined a pathway analysis and GWAS of other agronomic traits to identify pathways related to anthocyanin biosynthesis in potatoes. We found that methionine metabolism and the production of sugars and hydroxycinnamic acids are genetically correlated to anthocyanin biosynthesis. The results contribute to the understanding of anthocyanins regulation in potatoes and can be used in future breeding programs focused on nutraceutical food."
https://openalex.org/W3157565082,"Illegal driftnetting causes each year several entanglements and deaths of sperm whales in different Mediterranean areas, primarily in the Tyrrhenian Sea. In summer 2020, during the June-July fishing season, two sperm whales were found entangled in illegal driftnets in the Aeolian Archipelago waters, Southern Italy. These two rare events were an exceptional chance to collect behavioural and acoustics data about entangled sperm whales. We analysed 1132 one-minute sets of breathing/behavioural data and 1575 minutes of acoustic recording, when the whales were found entangled, during the rescue operation, immediately after release, and in the days thereafter. The first whale was generally quiet showing a general status of debilitation/weakness, numerous skin lesions, and low breathing rate (0.31 (0.60)); it collaborated during rescue operations. On the contrary, the second whale showed a high level of agitation with a high breathing rate (1.48 (1.31)) during both the entanglement period and the net cutting operations, vigorously moving its fluke and pectoral fins, opening its mouth, sideway rolling or side fluking and frequently defecating. Acoustically, the first whale produced mainly single clicks in all phases except for two series of creaks during rescuing operations while the second whale produced a wide range of vocalizations (single clicks, likely either slow clicks or regular clicks, creaks, and codas). Our observations indicate that acoustics, respiratory and behavioural parameters may be useful to monitor the physical/physiological status of sperm whales during disentanglement operations."
https://openalex.org/W3158345706,"The retinal insulin receptor (IR) exhibits basal kinase activity equivalent to that of the liver of fed animals, but unlike the liver, does not fluctuate with feeding and fasting; it also declines rapidly after the onset of insulin-deficient diabetes. The ligand(s) that determine basal IR activity in the retina has not been identified. Using a highly sensitive insulin assay, we found that retinal insulin concentrations remain constant in fed versus fasted rats and in diabetic versus control rats; vitreous fluid insulin levels were undetectable. Neutralizing antibodies against insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), but not insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) or insulin, decreased IR kinase activity in normal rat retinas, and depletion of IGF-2 from serum specifically reduced IR phosphorylation in retinal cells. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that IGF-2 induced greater phosphorylation of the retinal IR than the IGF-1 receptor. Retinal IGF-2 mRNA content was 10-fold higher in adults than pups and orders of magnitude higher than in liver. Diabetes reduced retinal IGF-2, but not IGF-1 or IR, mRNA levels, and reduced IGF-2 and IGF-1 content in vitreous fluid. Finally, intravitreal administration of IGF-2 (mature and pro-forms) increased retinal IR and Akt kinase activity in diabetic rats. Collectively, these data reveal that IGF-2 is the primary ligand that defines basal retinal IR activity and suggest that reduced ocular IGF-2 may contribute to reduced IR activity in response to diabetes.

These findings may have importance for understanding the regulation of metabolic and prosurvival signaling in the retina. Peptide growth factors are essential for the proliferation and differentiation of neuroprogenitor cells and for survival of fully differentiated retinal neurons, particularly under stress conditions (1Chaum E. Retinal neuroprotection by growth factors: A mechanistic perspective.J. Cell Biochem. 2003; 88: 57-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar).

However, it is unknown how the basal IR activity in normal adult animals is determined and how diabetes impacts this regulation. We first asked if the basal set point of retinal IR activity might be regulated by plasma insulin binding to retinal receptors. However, feeding and fasting does not change retinal IR activity as it does in the liver (6Reiter C.E. Sandirasegarane L. Wolpert E.B. Klinger M. Simpson I.A. Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Kester M. Gardner T.W. Characterization of insulin signaling in rat retina in vivo and ex vivo.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E763-E774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, we reasoned it was possible that the stable high basal retinal IR activity involves locally derived agonist ligand(s). Igf-1 and Igf-2 are expressed primarily in the liver and brain during development. Adult rats continue to express Igf-1 and Igf-2 in the brain with persistent transcriptional activity, whereas liver production of IGF-2 is nil (reviewed in (15Engstrom W. Shokrai A. Otte K. Granerus M. Gessbo A. Bierke P. Madej A. Sjolund M. Ward A. Transcriptional regulation and biological significance of the insulin like growth factor II gene.Cell Prolif. 1998; 31: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)). Lofqvist et al. (16Lofqvist C. Willett K.L. Aspegren O. Smith A.C. Aderman C.M. Connor K.M. Chen J. Hellstrom A. Smith L.E. Quantification and localization of the IGF/insulin system expression in retinal blood vessels and neurons during oxygen-induced retinopathy in mice.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that the IGF/insulin family of ligands and receptors is abundantly expressed in the mouse retina. Igf2 mRNA is 100- to 1000-fold more abundant than Igf1 or insulin (Ins) mRNA, and Igf1 receptor (Igf1R) is more abundant than the IR. Supporting an important role of IGF-2 in fully differentiated neuronal cells, Igf2-null mice have increased susceptibility to sciatic nerve transection (17Silva D. Dikkes P. Barnes M. Lopez M.F. Decreased motoneuron survival in Igf2 null mice after sciatic nerve transection.Neuroreport. 2009; 20: 1414-1418Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Of note, the growth-promoting effects of IGF-2 during development are mediated largely via the IR (18Louvi A. Accili D. Efstratiadis A. Growth-promoting interaction of IGF-II with the insulin receptor during mouse embryonic development.Dev. Biol. 1997; 189: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), and the retinal IR is highly sensitive to IGF-2 (reviewed in (19Reiter C.E.N. Gardner T.W. Retinal insulin and insulin signaling: Implications for diabetic retinopathy.Prog. Ret. Eye Res. 2003; 22: 545-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)). Taken together, these data led us to hypothesize that IGF-1 and/or IGF-2 may be important endogenous ligands of the retinal IR and play a critical prosurvival role in retinal neurons, a function disrupted by diabetes. Initial studies revealed persistent Igf1, Igf2, Ins, and IR transcript levels in the retina and liver during postnatal development and experimental diabetes. After assessing the basal retinal IR kinase activity, we demonstrated that intravitreal administration of a neutralizing IGF-2 antibody specifically reduces retinal IR kinase activity in normal rats. Moreover, we observed that diabetes reduces both retinal Igf2 mRNA content and IGF-2 protein content in the vitreous. Finally, we showed that intravitreal administration of rhIGF-2 restores retinal prosurvival signaling cascades in diabetic rats. Collectively, these findings provide novel insights into the regulation of prosurvival signaling pathways in the retina and how they are compromised by diabetes. Lofqvist et al. (16Lofqvist C. Willett K.L. Aspegren O. Smith A.C. Aderman C.M. Connor K.M. Chen J. Hellstrom A. Smith L.E. Quantification and localization of the IGF/insulin system expression in retinal blood vessels and neurons during oxygen-induced retinopathy in mice.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2009; 50: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) reported the high relative expression of retinal Igf-1/2 mRNA’s compared with insulin mRNA in normal mouse retina, but little is known about their expression and potential role in the adult mammalian retina. Previous studies have shown that IGF-1 and IGF-2 are important for cell growth (20Bergman D. Halje M. Nordin M. Engstrom W. Insulin-like growth factor 2 in development and disease: A mini-review.Gerontology. 2013; 59: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), so transcript levels were compared by qPCR in P7 pups and adult rats. Figure 1A shows that Igf2 mRNA content is 10-fold higher in adult retina than in postnatal retina; moreover, adult liver Igf2 expression is significantly less than in pups. These data are consistent with reports of high Igf2 content in adult brain compared with fetal brain (21Gray A. Tam A.W. Dull T.J. Hayflick J. Pintar J. Cavenee W.K. Koufos A. Ullrich A. Tissue-specific and developmentally regulated transcription of the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene.DNA. 1987; 6: 283-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 22Ye X. Kohtz A. Pollonini G. Riccio A. Alberini C.M. Insulin like growth factor 2 expression in the rat brain both in basal condition and following learning predominantly derives from the maternal allele.PLoS One. 2015; 10e0141078Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). By contrast, liver Igf1 mRNA was higher in adult than P7 pups, and retinal Igf1 content was equivalent in postnatal and adult eyes (Fig. 1B). Tissue-specific comparisons (Fig. 1, C and D) further reveal variations in Igf2 expression during ontogeny. There is 750 times more Igf2 mRNA in P7 liver versus retina, but adult retina Igf2 is substantially higher than in liver. By contrast, Igf1 content in P7 liver is 30-fold higher than in retina, and in adult rats, this difference further increases by a factor of 10 times. These results reveal that the adult retina expresses abundant IGF-1 and IGF-2, which likely function in an autocrine or paracrine manner (15Engstrom W. Shokrai A. Otte K. Granerus M. Gessbo A. Bierke P. Madej A. Sjolund M. Ward A. Transcriptional regulation and biological significance of the insulin like growth factor II gene.Cell Prolif. 1998; 31: 173-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Analysis of IR expression patterns (Fig. 2A) reveals that (1) retinal and liver IR mRNA contents are similar between P7 and adult animals and (2) IR mRNA content is 2- to 3-fold higher in liver than retina at both P7 and adult stages (Fig. 2B). Conversely, while there is a modest increase in Igf1R mRNA in adult compared with P7 retina, there is a 75% reduction in adult liver, leading to retinal expression being orders of magnitudes higher than liver in adulthood (Fig. 2, C and D). Collectively, these data demonstrate a high level of retinal IR and IGF1R expression in adult retina. To assess the mechanisms of reduced retinal IR kinase activity in diabetes, qPCR was performed for Insr and Igf1R and the associated ligands in control and age-matched rats after 4 weeks of diabetes (Fig. 3, A–D). Igf-2 but not Igf-1 mRNA content decreased in diabetic rat retinas; Igf-1 mRNA decreased in the diabetic rat liver, but Igf2 was not detected in this tissue. Insr and Igf1r mRNA contents were not changed by diabetes in either tissue. Body weights and blood glucose values are shown in Fig. S1. We previously showed that insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 can trigger IR autophosphorylation in ex vivo retinas (6Reiter C.E. Sandirasegarane L. Wolpert E.B. Klinger M. Simpson I.A. Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Kester M. Gardner T.W. Characterization of insulin signaling in rat retina in vivo and ex vivo.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E763-E774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), but there remained questions relative to the endogenous ligand(s) of the retinal IR in vivo. In the current study, we used a series of complementary approaches to examine the role of pancreas-derived insulin in the regulation of retinal IR activity. First, serum insulin concentrations were determined in P7 pups and in control and diabetic adult rats. Figure 4A shows the expected 10-fold greater serum insulin concentration in fed control versus paired animals after an overnight fast. Likewise, 4 weeks of insulin-deficient diabetes resulted in nearly complete loss of insulin, near the limits of assay sensitivity (0.2 ng/ml). No insulin could be detected in vitreous fluid of healthy rats. A second approach compared pancreatic and retinal insulin mRNA content (Fig. 4B), and as expected, pancreas insulin mRNA content was six orders of magnitude greater than in retina. The wide variation in insulin mRNA content is likely because of the heterogeneous distribution of islets in the rat pancreas (23Veite-Schmahl M.J. Regan D.P. Rivers A.C. Nowatzke J.F. Kennedy M.A. Dissection of the mouse pancreas for histological analysis and metabolic profiling.J. Vis. Exp. 2017; https://doi.org/10.3791/55647Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We cannot exclude the possibility that the low level of retinal insulin gene expression contributes sufficient peptide ligand to activate the retinal IR. We further determined that retinal insulin protein content did not vary with overnight fasting or diabetes (Fig. 4, C and D). Our values of approximately 4 ng insulin/g retinal tissue are equivalent to those reported by LeRoith et al. (24Le Roith D. Hendricks S.A. Lesniak M.A. Rishi S. Becker K.L. Havrankova J. Rosenzweig J.L. Brownstein M.J. Roth J. Insulin in brain and other extrapancreatic tissues of vertebrates and nonvertebrates.Adv. Metab. Disord. 1983; 10: 303-340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for brain and suggest a consistent level in the CNS. Together, these results distinguish the regulation of stable basal retinal IR activity from the fluctuating IR activity in peripheral tissues and suggest the possibility that additional ligands may regulate retinal IR activity. The preceding studies led us to employ a third approach using a cell culture system to examine the effects of physiologic fasting/feeding and streptozotocin-induced insulin-deficiency on IR phosphorylation (PY)in R28 retinal neurons, an established model for signaling studies (14Kong D. Gong L. Arnold E. Shanmugam S. Fort P.E. Gardner T.W. Abcouwer S.F. Insulin-like growth factor 1 rescues R28 retinal neurons from apoptotic death through ERK-mediated BimEL phosphorylation independent of Akt.Exp. Eye Res. 2016; 151: 82-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25Wu X. Reiter C.E. Antonetti D.A. Kimball S.R. Jefferson L.S. Gardner T.W. Insulin promotes rat retinal neuronal cell survival in a p70S6K-dependent manner.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9167-9175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We compared the effects of serum from fed, fasted, and diabetic rats on IR and IGF1R autophosphorylation and used immunodepletion techniques to assess the contribution of specific components of serum on receptor PY. Compared with untreated cells, 1% serum from fed rats induced prominent IR and IGF1Rß tyrosine PY that was approximately 50% greater than that from serum of rats fasted overnight (Fig. 4E) and increased in a concentration-dependent manner from 0.5% to 10% (Fig. 4F). By contrast, cells treated with serum from insulin-deficient diabetic rats did not show any increase over control cells, indicating the diabetic serum lacked an important soluble factor. To further determine the ligand(s) responsible for the effect of the serum, immunodepletion of albumin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP3), IGF-1, and IGF-2 was performed from control serum (Fig. 4G, samples # 2–7). Anti-insulin antibodies in 1% serum (sample # 3) in an amount sufficient to immunodeplete 10 nM insulin did not decrease IR autophosphorylation, thus pointing to another ligand. Depletion of IGF-2, however, reduced IR and IGF1R-PY by approximately 50%, but dual depletion of IGF-1 and IGF-2 had no additive effect. Depletion of albumin, IGFBP3, and IGF-1 did not diminish IR or IGF1R-PY specific immunoreactivity. The insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 antibodies were specific for each ligand. Anti-insulin antibodies blocked the IR PY when insulin up to 10 nM was added directly to the medium (samples 9–12 in Fig. 4G). The last two lanes of Figure 4G show that equimolar IGF-2, and insulin have equivalent effects on IR-PY content. These data demonstrate the specific effect of IGF-2 on retinal IR PY. Stimulation of R28 retinal neuronal cells showed a concentration-dependent increase of IR and IGF1R PY in response to serum from control but not diabetic animals (Fig. 4F). Taken together, these studies further support the role of IGF-2 as a ligand of retinal IR and IGF1R. The fourth experiment employed intravitreal injections of multiple neutralizing antibodies against insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 to determine the endogenous retinal IR ligand(s). Figure 4H shows that compared with uninjected eyes and eyes that received intravitreal PBS, insulin and IGF-1 monoclonal antibodies did not significantly reduce IR kinase activity, whereas the IGF-2 antibody significantly reduced IR kinase activity by 20%. Results are representative of five independent experiments. These acute experiments avoid potential compensation that might occur from genetic deletion of retinal IGF-2. These data indicate that IGF-2 is the predominant endogenous ligand contributing to the basal activity of the retinal IR. Fifth, the affinity of the IR for insulin and IGFs depends on the mRNA splice variants expressed (26Frasca F. Pandini G. Scalia P. Sciacca L. Mineo R. Costantino A. Goldfine I.D. Belfiore A. Vigneri R. Insulin receptor isoform A, a newly recognized, high-affinity insulin-like growth factor II receptor in fetal and cancer cells.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3278-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Therefore, IR splice variants were compared by PCR from normal adult rat retina, brain, and liver. Figure 4I shows the liver and kidney express only the B (exon 11+) splice variant, whereas retina and brain frontal lobe express only the A (exon 11-) form, which is more sensitive to IGF-2 (6Reiter C.E. Sandirasegarane L. Wolpert E.B. Klinger M. Simpson I.A. Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Kester M. Gardner T.W. Characterization of insulin signaling in rat retina in vivo and ex vivo.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2003; 285: E763-E774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These findings, combined with the 100- to 1000-fold higher level IGF-2 mRNA expression compared to insulin or IGF-1 (16Lofqvist C. Willett K.L. Aspegren O. Smith A.C. Aderman C.M. Connor K.M. Chen J.

Sci. 2009; 50: 1831-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggest autocrine/paracrine activation of the retinal IR by IGF-2, consistent with the high basal activity independent of feeding and fasting. We showed previously that insulin and IGF-2 activate the IR in normal ex vivo rat retinas (6Reiter C.E. Sandirasegarane L. Wolpert E.B. Klinger M. Simpson I.A. Barber A.J. Antonetti D.A. Kester M.

Metab. 2003; 285: E763-E774Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), the IR-ß from liver (11+ exon) migrates more slowly than that from retina (11− exon), and the adult rat liver expresses essentially no IGF1Rß protein. In addition, we injected Des[1–6]-IGF-2 lacking the IGF binding protein domain (29Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II binding to IGF-binding proteins and IGF receptors is modified by deletion of the N-terminal hexapeptide or substitution of arginine for glutamate-6 in IGF-II.Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) intravitreally in normal rats and assessed receptor autophosphorylation. The pattern shown in Figure 5B demonstrates a 2-fold greater increase in retinal IR-ß autophosphorylation than IGF1Rß autophosphorylation in response to IGF-2 versus PBS. Thus, the IR is a target for IGF-2 in the retina. IGF-2 activates IRs in adults (30Zapf J. Role of insulin-like growth factor II and IGF binding proteins in extrapancreatic tumor hypoglycemia.Horm. Res. 1994; 42: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar); thus, we examined the effects of recombinant human mature and pro-IGF-2 in ex vivo retinas. Both IGF-2 forms caused concentration-dependent increases in Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, and the effects were blocked by pretreatment with LY294002 (Fig. 5Ci and ii). These data further confirm the retina IR responds to IGF-2 stimulation via a PI3-kinase dependent pathway. Plasma insulin concentrations in control and age-matched diabetic animals are shown in Figure 4A. Serum IGF-2 content was examined by immunoblotting from sera of control and diabetic animals after 4 weeks of diabetes. Immunoblotting avoids interference by IGF binding proteins and reveals multiple molecular weight moieties (31Qiu Q. Jiang J.Y. Bell M. Tsang B.K. Gruslin A. Activation of endoproteolytic processing of insulin-like growth factor-II in fetal, early postnatal, and pregnant rats and persistence of circulating levels in postnatal life.Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 4803-4811Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Figure 6Ai and ii is a representative immunoblot comparing serum from a P7 control rat and nondiabetic control and 4 weeks duration diabetic rats. Long exposure blots reveal low levels of mature IGF-2 in P7 rats (Fig. 6Aii), and the adult animals exhibit negligible mature IGF-2. By contrast, moderate levels of 22 kDa pro-IGF-2 are detected in adult sera which were unaltered by diabetes (Fig. 6Aiii). Retinas from a P7 pup exhibit <1 ng of mature IGF-2 but show 15 kDa “big” IGF-2, again with no change resulting from diabetes (Fig. 6Bi and ii). By contrast, 4 weeks of diabetes reduces serum content of mature IGF-1 (Fig. 6Ci and ii). The intraocular concentrations of ligands were also measured in vitreous gel extracted from the same animals. Coomassie staining showed a 3-fold higher total protein content (by protein assay) (Fig. 6Di and ii) from the diabetic rat eyes despite loading equal volumes of vitreous, likely because of blood–retinal barrier leakage (32Do carmo A.

https://openalex.org/W3157766327,"Weaning is a critical period for piglets, in which unbalanced gut microbiota and/or pathogen colonisation can contribute to diseases that interfere with animal performance. Tannins are natural compounds that could be used as functional ingredients to improve gut health in pig farming thanks to their antibacterial, antioxidant, and antidiarrhoeal properties. In this study, a mixture of quebracho and chestnut tannins (1.25%) was evaluated for its efficacy in reducing the negative weaning effects on piglet growth. Microbiota composition was assessed by Illumina MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing of DNA extracted from stools at the end of the trial. Sequence analysis revealed an increase in the genera Shuttleworthia , Pseudobutyrivibrio , Peptococcus , Anaerostipes , and Solobacterium in the tannin-supplemented group. Conversely, this dietary intervention reduced the abundance of the genera Syntrophococcus , Atopobium , Mitsuokella , Sharpea , and Prevotella . The populations of butyrate-producing bacteria were modulated by tannin, and higher butyrate concentrations in stools were detected in the tannin-fed pigs. Co-occurrence analysis revealed that the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) belonging to the families Veillonellaceae , Lachnospiraceae , and Coriobacteriaceae occupied the central part of the network in both the control and the tannin-fed animals. Instead, in the tannin group, the OTUs belonging to the families Acidaminococcaceae , Alcaligenaceae , and Spirochaetaceae characterised its network, whereas Family XIII Incertae Sedis occupied a more central position than in the control group. Conversely, the presence of Desulfovibrionaceae characterised the network of the control group, and this family was not present in the network of the tannin group. Moreover, the prediction of metabolic pathways revealed that the gut microbiome of the tannin group possessed an enhanced potential for carbohydrate transport and metabolism, as well as a lower abundance of pathways related to cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis and inorganic ion transport. In conclusion, the tested tannins seem to modulate the gut microbiota, favouring groups of butyrate-producing bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W3157107595,"Outbreaks of influenza, which is a contagious respiratory disease, occur throughout the world annually, affecting millions of people with many fatal cases. The D222G/N mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of A(H1N1)pdm09 are associated with severe and fatal human influenza cases. These mutations lead to increased virus replication in the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and may result in life-threatening pneumonia. Targeted NGS analysis revealed the presence of mutations in major and minor variants in 57% of fatal cases, with the proportion of viral variants with mutations varying from 1% to 98% in each individual sample in the epidemic season 2018–2019 in Russia. Co-occurrence of the mutations D222G and D222N was detected in a substantial number of the studied fatal cases (41%). The D222G/N mutations were detected at a low frequency (less than 1%) in the rest of the studied samples from fatal and nonfatal cases of influenza. The presence of HA D222Y/V/A mutations was detected in a few fatal cases. The high rate of occurrence of HA D222G/N mutations in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, their increased ability to replicate in the LRT and their association with fatal outcomes points to the importance of monitoring the mutations in circulating A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses for the evaluation of their epidemiological significance and for the consideration of disease prevention and treatment options."
https://openalex.org/W3157905124,"Background Unsafe disposal of children’s stool makes children susceptible to fecal-oral diseases and children remain vulnerable till the stools of all children are disposed of safely. There is a paucity of data on spatial distribution and factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal in Ethiopia. Previous estimates, however, do not include information regarding individual and community-level factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal. Hence, the current study aimed (i) to explore the spatial distribution and (ii) to identify factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal in Ethiopia. Methods A secondary data analysis was conducted using the recent 2016 Ethiopian demographic and health survey data. A total of 4145 children aged 0–23 months with their mother were included in this analysis. The Getis-Ord spatial statistical tool was used to identify high and low hotspots areas of unsafe child stool disposal. The Bernoulli model was applied using Kilduff SaTScan version 9.6 software to identify significant spatial clusters. A multilevel multivariable logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with unsafe child stool disposal. Results Unsafe child stool disposal was spatially clustered in Ethiopia (Moran’s Index = 0.211, p-value&lt; 0.0001), and significant spatial SaTScan clusters of areas with a high rate of unsafe child stool disposal were detected. The most likely primary SaTScan cluster was detected in Tigray, Amhara, Afar (north), and Benishangul-Gumuz (north) regions (LLR: 41.62, p&lt;0.0001). Unsafe child stool disposal is more prevalent among households that had unimproved toilet facility (AOR = 1.54, 95%CI: 1.17–2.02) and those with high community poorer level (AOR: 1.74, 95%CI: 1.23–2.46). Higher prevalence of unsafe child stool disposal was also found in households with poor wealth quintiles. Children belong to agrarian regions (AOR: 0.62, 95%CI 0.42–0.91), children 6–11 months of age (AOR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.52–0.83), 12–17 months of age (AOR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.54–0.86), and 18–23 months of age (AOR: 0.58, 95%CI: 0.45–0.75) had lower odds of unsafe child stool disposal. Conclusions Unsafe child stool disposal was spatially clustered. Higher odds of unsafe child stool disposal were found in households with high community poverty level, poor, unimproved toilet facility, and with the youngest children. Hence, the health authorities could tailor effective child stool management programs to mitigate the inequalities identified in this study. It is also better to consider child stool management intervention in existing sanitation activities considering the identified factors."

Anaerobic environments are prolific in microbial communities that have developed different strategies to obtain energy without using oxygen as terminal electron acceptor in respiration processes. Dissimilatory metal-reducing organisms, such as the ones belonging to the Geobacter genera, couple cellular growth to the reduction of metals present in the environment (1Madigan M. Martinko J. Bender K. Buckley D. Stahl D. Brock Biology of Microorganisms.14th Ed. Benjamin Cummings, Boston, MA2014Google Scholar). This is only possible because of the development of an extracellular electron transport chain that is capable of shuttling electrons from the cell's interior to the environment (2Lovley D.R. Ueki T. Zhang T. Malvankar N.S. Shrestha P.M. Flanagan K.A. Aklujkar M. Butler J.E. Giloteaux L. Rotaru A.-E. Holmes D.E. Franks A.E. Orellana R. Risso C. Nevin K.P. Geobacter: The microbe electric's physiology, ecology, and practical applications.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2011; 59: 1-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Geobacter bacteria typically colonize aquatic sediments, wetlands, rice paddies, and subsurface environments (2Lovley D.R. Ueki T. Zhang T. Malvankar N.S. Shrestha P.M. Flanagan K.A. Aklujkar M. Butler J.E. Giloteaux L. Rotaru A.-E. Holmes D.E. Franks A.E. Orellana R. Risso C. Nevin K.P. Geobacter: The microbe electric's physiology, ecology, and practical applications.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2011; 59: 1-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) where the concentration of Fe(III) in sediments frequently exceeds that of other electron acceptors, such as oxygen, nitrate, and sulfate (3Lovely D.R.

This reduction is not only highly advantageous for the bacteria but also plays an essential role in the ecosystem's geochemistry because it releases dissolved Fe(II) and Mn(II) as well as trace metals, metalloids, and phosphate that adsorb onto Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides. The Geobacter metallireducens bacterium presents the unique ability of oxidizing an enormous variety of organic compounds both aromatic (such as benzaldehyde, phenol, benzene, and toluene) and nonaromatic (such as butanol, ethanol, and propanol) compared with Geobacter sulfurreducens, which is only able to oxidize acetate, formate, lactate, or pyruvate (the latter only when hydrogen is the electron donor) (2Lovley D.R.

Both species are capable of utilizing Fe(III), Mn(IV), or humic substances as terminal electron acceptors, as well as water contaminants such as U(VI) and Tc(VII) (2Lovley D.R. Ueki T. Zhang T.

This physiological hallmark has been used for the bioremediation of waters contaminated with these compounds (6Liu G. Zhou J. Chen C. Wang J. Jin R. Lv H.

However, the biotechnological applications of Geobacter are not only circumscribed to the bioremediation of contaminated waters, as their extracellular electron transfer pathways can be used for the sustainable production of electrical current from a wide range of organic wastes in microbial fuel cell devices (9Reguera G. Kashefi K. The electrifying physiology of Geobacter bacteria, 30 years on.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2019; 74: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Santoro C. Arbizzani C. Erable B.

To ensure the efficient extracellular electron transfer, Geobacter bacteria rely on a complex network of c-type cytochromes. In fact, c-type cytochromes comprise 2.2% and 2.6% of the genome of G. metallireducens and G. sulfurreducens, respectively, and more than 86% of these cytochromes possess more than one heme group (11Butler J.E. Young N.D. Lovley D.R. Evolution of electron transfer out of the cell: Comparative genomics of six Geobacter genomes.BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cytochromes are distributed along the inner membrane, periplasm, and outer membrane and are responsible for guiding the electron flow from the cytoplasm to the cell's exterior, constituting an excellent target for the improvement of extracellular electron transfer effectiveness (11Butler J.E.

Microbiol. 2015; 6: 752Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The current model for electron transfer in Geobacter (Fig. 1) postulates that electrons originating from the oxidation of organic compounds are transferred to a menaquinone pool via an NADH dehydrogenase located in the inner membrane (13Salgueiro C.A. Dantas J.M. Multiheme cytochromes.in: Multiheme Cytochromes. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg2016: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar). Depending on the redox potential of the final electron acceptor, the electrons are transferred to either one of two pathways: the CbcL-dependent pathway, which operates when the final electron acceptors are at or below redox potentials of −100 mV (versus the normal hydrogen electrode), whereas the ImcH pathway is used when final electron acceptors are above the referred redox potential (14Zacharoff L.

An inner membrane cytochrome required only for reduction of high redox potential extracellular electron acceptors.mBio. 2014; 5: 1-9Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The electrons are then transferred from CbcL or ImcH to the PpcA c-type cytochrome family located in the periplasm (9Reguera G. Kashefi K. The electrifying physiology of Geobacter bacteria, 30 years on.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2019; 74: 1-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and from these to porin-cytochrome transouter membrane complexes (such as the OmaB–OmbB–OmcB or OmaC–OmbC–OmcC), which convey the electrons to the extracellular electron acceptors (16Liu Y.

The PpcA family is composed by triheme cytochromes with negative reduction potentials and bis-histidine axial coordinated hemes (13Salgueiro C.A. Dantas J.M. Multiheme cytochromes.in: Multiheme Cytochromes. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, Berlin, Heidelberg2016: 1-39Crossref Google Scholar). To maintain consistency with the literature, the hemes in this family are numbered I, III, and IV, a designation that derives from their superimposition with those of the structurally homologous tetraheme cytochrome c3 (21Pessanha M. Morgado L. Louro R.O. Londer Y.Y. Pokkuluri P.R. Schiffer M. Salgueiro C.A.

The PpcA family is one of the most conserved among Geobacter (11Butler J.E. Young N.D. Lovley D.R. Evolution of electron transfer out of the cell: Comparative genomics of six Geobacter genomes.BMC Genomics. 2010; 11: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is constituted by five cytochromes both in G. sulfurreducens and G. metallireducens. In G. sulfurreducens, the cytochromes are designated PpcA–PpcE, whereas in G. metallireducens, they are designated PpcA–PpcF because of the very low degree of homology between the PpcD from G. sulfurreducens, and the fifth member from G. metallireducens, the designation PpcF was adopted (22Ferreira M.R. Dantas J.M. Salgueiro C.A. The triheme cytochrome PpcF from Geobacter metallireducens exhibits distinct redox properties.FEBS Open Bio. 2018; 8: 1897-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The cytochrome PpcA from G. sulfurreducens has been extensively studied and shares 80% of amino acid sequence identity with PpcA from G. metallireducens, differing only in 13 residues. A preliminary structural study has suggested that these two proteins share a high structural homology with some differences near hemes I and III (23Portela P.C. Fernandes T.M. Dantas J.M. Ferreira M.R. Salgueiro C.A. Biochemical and functional insights on the triheme cytochrome PpcA from Geobacter metallireducens.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2018; 644: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, a detailed functional characterization has shown that these two proteins possess markedly different mechanistic properties (24Fernandes T.M. Morgado L. Salgueiro C.A. Thermodynamic and functional characterization of the periplasmic triheme cytochrome PpcA from Geobacter metallireducens.Biochem. J. 2018; 475: 2861-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In fact, the order of oxidation of the heme groups is different (IV–I–III in PpcA from G. metallireducens and I–IV–III in PpcA from G. sulfurreducens) as well as their apparent midpoint redox potential values (−93 mV for PpcA from G. metallireducens and −138 mV for PpcA from G. sulfurreducens, at pH 8). Given the high structural similarity between the two cytochromes, their different redox properties, and the fact that PpcA from G. metallireducens possesses two extra aromatic amino acids at the heme core (Fig. 2A), it was our goal to determine the impact of these two residues in the functional properties of PpcA from G. metallireducens. For this, we have replaced the amino acids Phe-6 (F6) and Trp-45 (W45) by their counterparts Leu-6 (L6) and Met-45 (M45) in PpcA from G. sulfurreducens. We have constructed two single mutants (PpcAF6L and PpcAW45M) and a double mutant (PpcAF6LW45M) to probe the effect of each single mutation and their joint effect. For each mutant, we first evaluated the structural impact of the mutations using NMR spectroscopy. Then, the effect of the mutations in the midpoint redox potential value was probed by potentiometric titrations followed by UV–visible spectroscopy. For the mutant(s) with the biggest impact on this value, a detailed thermodynamic characterization was obtained using a combination of NMR and UV–visible spectroscopic data. The data obtained allowed us to elucidate the role of the extra aromatic residues in PpcA from G. metallireducens, and their contribution to the modulation of the distinct functional properties shown by this cytochrome and its homolog in G. sulfurreducens. The structural impact of the introduction of mutations in position 6 or/and 45 was evaluated using NMR spectroscopy. The NMR signals of the side chain's aromatic protons cover a very typical region in the 1H-NMR spectrum and, upon successful introduction of the mutations, the side-chain signals of the replaced aromatic amino acids were no longer observable in the 1D 1H NMR spectra (Fig. 2). This was further corroborated in the 2D 1H and 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra in which the characteristic signal Hε1 from Trp-45 at 10.2 ppm was absent in the PpcAW45M and PpcAF6LW45M mutants but present in the PpcAF6L mutant (Fig. 3). After confirming the successful replacements of the targeted amino acids, we proceeded to assign the heme substituent and backbone signals of each mutant using, respectively, 2D 1H, 1H-TOCSY, 2D 1H, 1H-NOESY spectra, and 2D 1H, 1H-TOCSY, 2D 1H, 1H-NOESY, and 2D 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra. The assigned signals were deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank under the accession numbers 50730 (PpcAF6L), 50731 (PpcAW45M), and 50732 (PpcAF6LW45M). The signal dispersion in the 2D 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra of the mutants is very similar to that of the wildtype protein (Fig. 3). The most affected NH signals are Glu-3 to Ala-8 and Ile-38 to Gly-52 in PpcAF6L and PpcAW45M, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). In the double-mutant PpcAF6LW45M, the most affected regions are a combination of the most affected ones in the single mutants (Fig. 3C). We further analyzed the effects of the mutations on the heme substituent signals (Fig. 4). Compared with the wildtype protein, the rmsds of the mutants are low: 0.05, 0.08 and 0.10 ppm for PpcAF6L, PpcAW45M, and PpcAF6LW45M, respectively, although slightly higher for the double mutant, as expected from the substitution of two aromatic rings and elimination of their ring-current effect contribution to the observed chemical shifts. The good correlation obtained for the chemical shifts of heme protons in the mutant and wildtype cytochromes (Fig. 4A) indicates that the heme cores were unaffected by the mutations. In PpcAF6L, the most affected substituents are 121CH3I, 121CH3IV, and 21CH3III (Fig. 4, B and C). In PpcAW45M, the most affected substituent is 32CH3III, followed by 10HI, 31HIII, 81HI, 121CH3I, and 121CH3IV. Finally, in PpcAF6LW45M, the most affected substituents are a combination of the most affected ones in the single mutants: 21CH3III, 32CH3III, 81HI, 10HI, and 121CH3I are the most affected, followed by 31HIII, 121CH3IV, and 20HIII. After confirming that the overall folding and heme core were conserved in the mutated cytochromes, the functional impact of each substitution was probed by determining their apparent redox potential value (Eapp) through potentiometric titrations followed by UV–visible spectroscopy (Fig. 5). This permitted us to screen the effect of the substitutions on the overall (also designated macroscopic) redox behavior of the proteins and to select the mutants for a redox characterization at the microscopic level to determine the redox properties associated with each redox center. Indeed, the redox curves depicted in Figure 5 only describe the macroscopic redox behavior of the proteins and, in the case of triheme cytochromes, three consecutive one-electron transfer steps convert the fully reduced state in the fully oxidized state (see Experimental procedures section and Fig. S1). Thus, in simple terms, from these redox curves, we can obtain qualitative information about the hemes that dominate the electron transfer in each oxidation step. The Eapp values correspond to the point at which the oxidized and reduced fractions of the cytochromes are equal and are listed in Table 1. To better illustrate the effect of the replacements on the redox curves, the fitting of the potentiometric redox titrations of the three mutated proteins is compared with those previously obtained for PpcA cytochromes from G. metallireducens and G. sulfurreducens in Figure 5 (bottom-right panel). The shape of the curve and the Eapp value of PpcAF6L are similar to the wildtype cytochrome (−90 and −93 mV, respectively). This suggests that the residue Phe-6 has a negligible impact in the modulation of the redox potential of the hemes and, hence, on the less negative working potential range of PpcA from G. metallireducens compared with its homolog in G. sulfurreducens. On the contrary, both the shape and the Eapp value of PpcAW45M differ substantially from the wildtype cytochrome. The more negative Eapp value observed for PpcAW45M (−108 mV) clearly indicates that the residue Trp-45 contributes to the less negative Eapp value of PpcA from G. metallireducens. This is further corroborated by the analysis of the double mutant's redox curve, which has a comparable shape to that of PpcAW45M but an Eapp value (−99 mV) between those of the single mutants PpcAW45M (−108 mV) and PpcAF6L (−90 mV), indicating that the observed effect of the two mutations is additive.Table 1Apparent and macroscopic reduction potentials (versus normal hydrogen electrode) for mutants PpcAF6L, PpcAW45M, and PpcAF6LW45M at pH 8, 15 °CProteinEapp (mV)E1 (mV)E2 (mV)E3 (mV)PpcAF6L−90 (3)−152 (3)−91 (3)−18 (3)PpcAW45M−108 (1)−155 (1)−110 (1)−53 (1)PpcAF6LW45M−99 (1)−151 (1)−100 (1)−46 (1)PpcA Gm (23Portela P.C.

The values for PpcA from G. metallireducens (Gm) and PpcA from G. sulfurreducens (Gs) were previously determined and are included for comparison. Compared with the wildtype cytochrome, the macroscopic redox behavior of the PpcAW45M was the most distinct and shifted by 33% the working redox potential range of the protein toward the one observed for PpcA from G. sulfurreducens (Table 1). For this reason, this mutant was selected for a detailed thermodynamic characterization in experimental conditions that match those previously reported for the wildtype protein (24Fernandes T.M. Morgado L. Salgueiro C.A. Thermodynamic and functional characterization of the periplasmic triheme cytochrome PpcA from Geobacter metallireducens.Biochem. J. 2018; 475: 2861-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Therefore, the same set of heme methyl groups (21CH3I, 121CH3III, and 21CH3IV) was used to probe the individual heme oxidation profiles in 2D 1H, 1H-EXchange SpectroscopY (EXSY) NMR spectra acquired in the pH range of 6.1 to 8.5. We were able to obtain well-resolved 2D 1H, 1H-EXSY NMR spectra in the indicated pH range, which permitted us to obtain discrete NMR signals for all oxidation stages. As an example, the oxidation profiles of the hemes at pH 6.1 and the correspondent oxidation fraction in each oxidation stage, together with those of the wildtype protein, are illustrated in Figure 6. The heme oxidation fractions show that heme IV dominates the first oxidation step (52%), followed by heme I in the second (47%) and then by heme III in the third (60%). Compared with the wildtype protein, the oxidation fractions of heme III are the most affected ones (cf. solid and dashed lines in Fig. 6B). The higher oxidation fraction values of heme III in the mutant suggest that the reduction potential of this heme is decreased. Compared with heme III, the oxidation fractions of the other hemes also vary, though in a lesser extent. These changes occur to compensate the variation of oxidation fractions of heme III since in oxidation stages 1 and 2 only a total of one and two hemes can be oxidized, respectively. The analysis of the slopes of the lines connecting each stage of oxidation in Figure 6B also provides the order of oxidation of the heme groups. In fact, and despite the changes in the hemes' oxidation profiles, the oxidation of hemes IV, I, and III dominate the first, second, and third stages of oxidation, respectively, and thus the heme oxidation order is conserved in the mutant and wildtype cytochromes: IV–I–III. To quantify the variation of the redox centers' thermodynamic parameters in PpcAW45M, the pH dependence of the heme methyl NMR signals, measured at different oxidation stages together with UV–visible redox titration data, was fitted to the thermodynamic model summarized in the Experimental procedures section (Fig. 7). The thermodynamic parameters and macroscopic pKa values of the redox–Bohr center are indicated in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. As indicated in Figure 7, the data obtained from the NMR and UV–visible potentiometric redox titrations are well described by the thermodynamic model.Table 2Thermodynamic parameters determined for PpcAW45M in the fully reduced and protonated formProtein’s redox centersEnergy (meV)Heme IHeme IIIHeme IVRedox–Bohr centerPpcAW45M (this work) Heme I−95 (4)23 (2)7 (3)−19 (6) Heme III−94(4)26 (3)−19 (6) Heme IV−112 (4)−47 (6) Redox–Bohr center447 (8)PpcA Gm (24Fernandes T.M.

https://openalex.org/W3158988584,"Background German statutory health insurance began covering the costs associated with HIV PrEP in September 2019; however, to bill for PrEP services, physicians in Germany must either be certified as HIV-specialists according to a nationwide quality assurance agreement, or, if they are non-HIV-specialists, have completed substantial further training in HIV/PrEP care. Given the insufficient implementation of PrEP, the aim of our study was to explore the potential to increase the number of non-HIV-specialists providing PrEP-related services. Methods We conducted an anonymous survey among a random sample of internists, general practitioners, dermatologists and urologists throughout Germany using a self-developed questionnaire. We calculated a knowledge score and an attitudes score from individual items in these two domains. Both scores ranged from 0–20, with high values representing good knowledge or positive attitudes. We also asked participants about the proportion of PrEP advice they provided proactively to men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans-persons who met the criteria to be offered PrEP. Results 154 physicians completed the questionnaire. Self-assessed knowledge among HIV-specialists was greater than among non-HIV-specialists [ Median knowledge score: 20.0 ( IQR = 0.0) vs. 4.0 ( IQR = 11.0), p &lt;0.001]. Likewise, attitudes towards PrEP were more positive among HIV-specialists than non-HIV-specialists [ Median attitudes score: 18.0 ( IQR = 3.0) vs. 13.0 ( IQR = 5.25), p &lt;0.001]. The proportion of proactive advice on PrEP provided to at-risk MSM and trans-persons by HIV-specialists [ Median : 30.0% ( IQR = 63.5%)] was higher than that provided by non-HIV-specialists [ Median : 0.0% ( IQR = 11.3%), p &lt;0.001]. However, the results of our multiple regression suggest the only independent predictor of proactive PrEP advice was the knowledge score, and not whether physicians were HIV-specialists or non-HIV-specialists. Conclusions These findings point to opportunities to improve PrEP implementation in individuals at risk of acquiring HIV. Targeted training, particularly for non-HIV-specialists, and the provision of patient-centered information material could help improve care, especially in rural areas."

We assessed the feasibility of conducting a population-based study in India to examine the distributions and levels of Porphyromonas gingivalis , Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia in relation to oral leukoplakia (a potentially malignant disorder) and other participant characteristics. Methods This exploratory case-control study was nested within a large urban Indian cohort and the data included 22 men and women with oral leukoplakia (cases) and 69 leukoplakia-free controls. Each participant provided a salivary rinse sample, and a subset of 34 participants (9 cases; 25 controls) also provided a gingival swab sample from keratinized gingival surface for quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Results Neither the distribution nor the levels of pathogens were associated with oral leukoplakia; however, individual pathogen levels were more strongly correlated with each other in cases compared to controls. Among controls, the median level of total pathogens was the highest (7.55×10 4 copies/ng DNA) among persons of low socioeconomic status. Salivary rinse provided better DNA concentration than gingival swab for qPCR analysis (mean concentration: 1.8 ng/μl vs. 0.2 ng/μl). Conclusions This study confirms the feasibility of population studies evaluating oral microbiome in low-resource settings and identifies promising leads for future research."

https://openalex.org/W3158772805,"I was in the second year of my Ph.D. program when a colleague asked what I would do if I had an extra hour every day. Without much deliberation, I said I would use it to help others. The question haunted me. Like many graduate students, I was overwhelmed with research, teaching, coursework, and some attempt at a personal life. Still, I asked myself, “Do I really need a 25th hour to help other people—or do I need to make better use of the 24 hours I have?” A short time later, I started to volunteer for an organization that provides transportation for senior citizens and people with disabilities. To my surprise, adding this activity to my busy life was just what I needed to calm the chaos I was feeling as a first-generation international graduate student."
https://openalex.org/W3159278293,"David William Schindler, innovative ecologist, died on 4 March at the age of 80. Dave documented humanity's impact on global freshwaters with seminal research on eutrophication, acid rain, climate change, organic contaminants, and oil sands mining. He then used his formidable energy and dedication to advocate for regulation of harmful industrial practices and to educate the public about why these regulations were needed.

Dave was born in Fargo, North Dakota, on 3 August 1940 but raised near Barnesville, Minnesota. He enrolled in an engineering physics program at North Dakota State University in 1958, but a chance reading of Charles Elton's book The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants during a summer biology internship changed his life forever. Switching majors, he earned his bachelor's degree in zoology in 1962. He then pursued his PhD in ecology with Elton as a Rhodes scholar at the University of Oxford, studying energy relations in aquatic food chains. Just 2 years after receiving his doctorate in 1966, he was scouted to become the first scientific director of the Experimental Lakes Area (ELA), a Canadian field station newly created for the purpose of using whole-ecosystem manipulations to address freshwater problems of international concern. In 1989, he left to become the Killam Memorial Chair and Professor of Ecology at the University of Alberta, a position he held until 2013. Thereafter, although nominally retired, Dave continued uninterrupted in his scientific research and advocacy. He was inspired by his wife, ecologist Suzanne Bayley, and his three children.

Dave's singular success arose from his early recognition that complex ecosystems function in ways not predictable from smaller bottle and aquarium experiments and that the whole system therefore needs to serve as the unit of experimentation. When tasked with bringing this approach to life at the ELA, a set of 58 headwater lakes in northern Ontario, he intuitively assembled a team with expertise in hydrology, lake physics, biogeochemistry, microbiology, plankton, benthic invertebrates, and both small and large fish. He established a year-round boot camp for scientists to do one-of-a-kind collaborative freshwater research. Science was discussed at communal meals, in boats, in laboratories, and on the swimming dock. As Dave was a habitual early riser, it was an unfortunate scientist who did not bring their best ideas to breakfast.

By changing only one factor at a time, Dave was able to study the cascading effects of that change through different parts of the lake ecosystem and, crucially, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of change. Early whole-lake experiments demonstrated that phosphorus was the limiting nutrient for photosynthesis in lakes (nitrogen and carbon could easily be obtained from the atmosphere) and that limiting phosphorus inputs would therefore solve eutrophication. By adding sulfuric or nitric acids to lakes, he showed that small decreases in pH alone could disrupt food chains, leading to starvation of fish. These efforts resulted in two of the most iconic photographs in freshwater research. One photo showed that the side of a divided two-basin lake receiving experimental phosphorus additions turned pea green from an algal bloom. The second photo showed a gaunt lake trout from an experimentally acidified lake. Dave used these photos to rally public support and force needed legislation.



While at the ELA, Dave also fortuitously began amassing the world's largest dataset on climate change impacts on freshwaters through the basic monitoring of unmanipulated reference watersheds, which has continued now for more than 50 years as Earth has warmed. An initial publication after only 20 years provided an early preview of the effects of warming on boreal lakes.

The Alberta oil sands industry claimed that petroleum-related compounds in the Athabasca River were all natural, but Dave was instinctively skeptical. His ensuing studies showed that the industry was a regional source of organic contaminants and metals. At a news conference, Dave showcased fish with unusual tumors downriver of the oil sands developments, and this kind of easily understood public demonstration led to the establishment of an independent inquiry.

Unfettered by societal norms, Dave freely followed his innate scientific intuition. He had no patience for half-baked ideas, political wrangling, pessimistic whining, or experimental roadblocks. At the same time, Dave was a strong supporter of fledgling scientists, empowering even undergraduate summer students to contribute as equals. He taught us that ruffling feathers probably meant you were actually getting somewhere, and he reassured us with his pithy maxim that “Science bats last,” meaning that scientific evidence will always prevail.

Dave had energy to burn. An avid woodworker, canoer, hunter, fisherman, and mountain biker, he was always happiest outdoors. He and Suzanne also competitively raced the multitudes of champion sled dogs they raised.

A prodigious communicator of his scientific research, Dave published more than 350 papers. He received upward of 100 prestigious awards, including the first Stockholm Water Prize, and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. Each year, he gave dozens of presentations, many of them public talks, and unscripted interviews on television and radio. He was also a vocal champion for Canadian Indigenous communities affected by the broader population's impacts on their treaty lands and traditional freshwater resources.

To many, Dave seemed larger than life. His research fundamentally changed freshwater science and the lives of generations of students. We each had the good fortune of having Dave as a mentor, colleague, and friend for more than 40 years. Dave's scientific and public legacy remains as both an inspiration and a call to action."
