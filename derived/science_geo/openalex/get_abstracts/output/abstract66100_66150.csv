https://openalex.org/W1989653618,"Silicon, a relatively unknown trace element in nutritional research, has been uniquely localized in active calcification sites in young bone. Silicon increases directly with calcium at relatively low calcium concentrations and falls below the detection limit at compositions approaching hydroxyapatite. It is suggested that silicon is associated with calcium in an early stage of calcification."

Removal of the Harderian gland abolishes the response to light in blinded animals, which suggests that this gland may act as the extraretinal transducer involved in the persistence of the pineal rhythm in blinded suckling rats."
https://openalex.org/W2037439629,"The myofibrils in an isolated muscle fiber remain straight during the early part of a lightly loaded contraction initiated by membrane depolarization, but, as shortening continues, myofibrils in the core of the fiber become wavy, which suggests that their activation has been interrupted by shortening of the fiber. This may be a factor determining the length-tension relation at short muscle lengths."

The tooth matrix induced alkaline phosphatase activity within 24 hours; cartilage appeared within 5 days; bone and bone marrow formed within 14 days. The induced cartilage disappeared within 5 weeks, but bone persisted at least 1 year."

https://openalex.org/W2094579172,"5-Phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate, a substrate shared by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, accumulates in human erythrocytes lacking hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. 5-Phosphoribosyl-l-pyrophosphate added to purified adenine phosphoribosyltransferase stabilizes it against heat inactivation. The increased activity of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase seen in erythrocytes deficient in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase may result from substrate stabilization of this enzyme in vivo."

A stopped-flow spectrofluorometer was used to study the kinetics renaturation of nuclease from the acidified form on neutralization, the refolding is fast and the data can be described as a sequence of two first-order processes with half times of about 55 and 350 milliseconds, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2084538674,5-Hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) in micromolar amounts increased the growth of fibroblasts in culture while not affecting five other cell lines. Serotonin appeared to shorten the lag phase of cell growth. The effect was less when serotonin was added to the fibroblast culture after the initial 24-hour period. The two functional groups of the serotonin molecule were required for growth enhancement. Serotonin in millimolar concentrations was toxic to fibroblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2042948677,"The hypothesis that, after receiving reward and nonreward, rats excrete differential odors perceptible to other rats was tested by making the correct turn in a T-maze contingent on discrimination of any such odors. Clear evidence for an ""odor of nonreward or frustration"" was obtained, and there was the suggestion of a transistory odor after early reward trials."

As isolated, the molecule shows some terminal and internal heterogeneity. The sequence permits extensive base pairing and contains prominent repeating sequences. A portion of the sequence resembles a sequence found in several transfer RNA's."

The inhibitinig protein fraction wast a cation as judged by electrophoresis; it had a molecuer weight of 125,000 to 200,000 as judged by gel filtration; antd oil diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography it eluted with the immunoglobulin G fraction. The analogous fraction in normal individuals did not inhibit oyster cillary activity."

https://openalex.org/W1984378737,Meningeal tissue of the lamprey larva produces glucose during incubation and contains glucose-6-phosphatase and large amounts of glycogen. Little glucose is liberated by brains from which meninges have been removed. This primitive meningeal tissue may produce glucose for use by the brain during periods of metabolic stress.

Salivary g1ands were infected 11 days after the flies took an infective blood meal. This is the first report of a malaria parasite undergoing sporogonic development In an insect other than a mosquito and the first description of lizard malaria sporogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1998298450,"Lunar fines and a chip from inside a rock pyrolyzed in helium at 700°C gave methane, other gases, and aromatic hydrocarbons. Benzene/methanol extracts of fines yielded traces of high molecular weight alkanes and sulfur. Traces of glycine, alanine, ethanolamine, and urea were found in aqueous extracts. Biological controls and a terrestrial rock, dunite, subjected to exhaust from the lunar module descent engine showed a different amino acid distribution. Interpretation of the origin of the carbon compounds requires extreme care, because of possible contamination acquired during initial sample processing."

https://openalex.org/W1983753974,THERE is some controversy about the presence in elastin of an ordered structure1–3. Mammi et al.4 now report evidence for the occurrence of some degree of α-helix conformation in the native protein. The conformation was previously5 observed in soluble elastin; the temperature coefficient of the α-helix had different values in solvents such as water or glycol. We have studied the thermoelastic behaviour of elastin in order to gain information on its conformation6.

The sources of these amino acids may be terrestrial contaminants, fuel exhaust products, or indigenous lunar material. The lunar particles found in the sample include: (i) spherules, rotational ellipsoids, dumbbells, tear-drops, rings, and crescents which have (ii) diameters of 0.1 to 500 microns; (iii) budlike features on the particles; and (iv) chemical inhomogeneity (electron probe). Some of the processes and results inferred for the moon have been simulated by the electron beam and low pressure of the electron microscope. Basalt (Kilauea-Iki) and chondrite (Orgueil) have been found to behave similarly."

Biological examination of 50 grains of the bulk fines confirm the negative results obtained by the Manned Spacecraft Center quarantine team. No viable life forms, including terrestrial contaminants, were found when the sample was tested in 300 separate environments. Only colored inorganic artifacts, resembling microbial clones, appeared around some particles."
