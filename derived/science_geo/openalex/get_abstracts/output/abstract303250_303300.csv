https://openalex.org/W1972466773,"Micromachining technology was used to prepare chemical analysis systems on glass chips (1 centimeter by 2 centimeters or larger) that utilize electroosmotic pumping to drive fluid flow and electrophoretic separation to distinguish sample components. Capillaries 1 to 10 centimeters long etched in the glass (cross section, 10 micrometers by 30 micrometers) allow for capillary electrophoresis-based separations of amino acids with up to 75,000 theoretical plates in about 15 seconds, and separations of about 600 plates can be effected within 4 seconds. Sample treatment steps within a manifold of intersecting capillaries were demonstrated for a simple sample dilution process. Manipulation of the applied voltages controlled the directions of fluid flow within the manifold. The principles demonstrated in this study can be used to develop a miniaturized system for sample handling and separation with no moving parts."
https://openalex.org/W2009982350,"Several alkalic igneous complexes of nephelinite-carbonatite affinities occur in extensional zones around a region of high heat flow and positive gravity anomaly within the continental flood basalt (CFB) province of Deccan, India. Biotites from two of the complexes yield (40)Ar/(39)Ar dates of 68.53 +/- 0.16 and 68.57 +/- 0.08 million years. Biotite from a third complex, which intrudes the flood basalts, yields an (40)Ar/(39)Ar date of 64.96 +/- 0.1 1 million years. The complexes thus represent early and late magmatism with respect to the main pulse of CFB volcanism 65 million years ago. Rocks from the older complexes show a (3)He/(4)He ratio of 14.0 times the air ratio, an initial (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio of 0.70483, and other geochemical characteristics similar to ocean island basalts; the later alkalic pulse shows isotopic evidence of crustal contamination. The data document 3.5 million years of incubation of a primitive, high-(3)He mantle plume before the rapid eruption of the Deccan CFB."
https://openalex.org/W2060544699,The lengths of food chains within ecosystems have been thought to be limited either by the productivity of the ecosystem or by the resilience of that ecosystem after perturbation. Models based on ecological energetics that follow the form of Lotka-Volterra equations and equations that include material (detritus) recycling show that productivity and resilience are inextricably interrelated. The models were initialized with data from 5-to 10-year studies of actual soil food webs. Estimates indicate that most ecological production worldwide is from ecosystems that are themselves sufficiently productive to recover from minor perturbations.
https://openalex.org/W1984663627,"The rate of retinal photoisomerization in wild-type bacteriorhodopsin (wt bR) is compared with that in a number of mutants in which a positively charged (Arg82), a negatively charged (Asp85 or Asp212), or neutral hydrogen bonding (Asp115 or Tyr185) amino acid residue known to be functionally important within the retinal cavity is replaced by a neutral, non-hydrogen bonding one. Only the replacements of the charged residues reduced the photoisomerization rate of the 13-cis and all-trans isomers present in these mutants by factors of ∼1/4 and ∼1/20, respectively. Retinal photo- and thermal isomerization catalysis and selectivity in wt bR by charged residues is discussed in terms of the known protein structure, the valence-bond wave functions of the ground and excited state of the retinal, and the electrostatic stabilization interactions within the retinal cavity."
https://openalex.org/W1974437320,"An electrooptical memory effect is observed with solid thin films of the photoconductor zinc-octakis(beta-decoxyethyl) porphyrin (ZnODEP) sandwiched between two optically transparent electrodes. Upon irradiation with the simultaneous application of an electric field, electron-hole pairs are generated and separated within the photoconductive layer. These electron-hole pairs become ""frozen"" within the films when the irradiation is interrupted. These trapped charges can be released by irradiation of the cell, resulting in a transient short-circuit photocurrent. No cross talk between adjacent memory elements separated by approximately 0.2 micrometer (a density of 3 gigabits per square centimeter) was detected. The charge storage system is robust and nonvolatile. The response time for the write-read beam is in the subnanosecond range, and no refreshing is required for long-term retention of trapped charges."
https://openalex.org/W1980562480,"Solute speciation in supercritical aqueous alkali metal halide solutions plays an important role in various industrial and natural processes, for example, corrosion of metals, solvent extraction, crystal growth, metamorphism, and the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits. To better characterize such speciation, degrees of formation of polyatomic clusters of sodium and chlorine ions have been computed with the aid of dissociation constants generated from Monte Carlo calculations which are consistent with both supercritical conductance measurements and electrostatic theory. The calculations indicate that the solute in alkali-halide solutions is successively dominated by increasingly complex polyatomic clusters as the solute molality increases at pressures and temperatures where the dielectric constant of water is ≲ 15."
https://openalex.org/W1978451856,"The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) was used to control the configuration of antimony clusters on the (001) surface of silicon. In particular, the STM tip induced a reversible rotation between two orthogonal orientations of individual antimony dimers on the surface. This simple rotation can be explained by an atomic-scale torque exerted on the antimony dimers by the STM tip. The reversibility of this process could provide a basis for making atomic-scale memory cells."

https://openalex.org/W2076975490,"A new approach is described for probing domains of ordered self-assemblies of amphiphilic monolayers at the aqueous solution interface. The method has potential importance for the study of membrane structure, Langmuir-Blodgett films, and nucleation processes of two-and three-dimensional crystals. Electron diffraction (ED) patterns indicative of two-dimensional crystalline self-assembly were obtained from samples, which were examined by cryo-electron microscopy, of monolayers of water-insoluble amphiphiles on vitrified aqueour substrates. The apparent hexagonal symmetry of an ED pattern from a C(16)H(33)OH monolayer was interpreted in terms of multiple twinning. Monolayers of the CL(31)H(63)OH and cadmium salt of C(19)H(39)CO(2)H that were studied by dark-field techniques displayed faceted two-dimensional crystallites with a maximal size of 1 to 2 micrometers. Epitaxial nucleation of hexagonal ice by the C(31)H(63)OH monolayer has also been demonstrated by ED."

Most categories of large-scale scientific computations have proven remarkably amenable to parallel computation, but often the algorithms involved are different from those used on sequential machines. By surveying a range of examples of parallel scientific computations, this article summarizes our current understanding of the issues of applicability and programming of parallel computers for scientific applications."
https://openalex.org/W1975280352,Continuing improvements in integrated circuit technology and computer architecture have driven microprocessors to performance levels that rival those of supercomputers—at a fraction of the price. The use of sophisticated memory hierarchies enables microprocessor-based machines to have very large memories built from commodity dynamic random access memory while retaining the high bandwidth and low access time needed in a high-performance machine. Parallel processors composed of these high-performance microprocessors are becoming the supercomputing technology of choice for scientific and engineering applications. The challenges for these new supercomputers have been in developing multiprocessor architectures that are easy to program and that deliver high performance without extraordinary programming efforts by users. Recent progress in multiprocessor architecture has led to ways to meet these challenges.

https://openalex.org/W2066793744,"From the start, the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) has been an academic project in every sense: designed, built, and eventually to be operated by companies and researchers working under a consortium of 79 universities called Universities Research Association (URA). No longer. Last week, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary took the job of building the $11 billion accelerator away from URA and announced plans to give it to a company more experienced with large construction projects. Clinton Administration officials hope that the change, which followed highly publicized investigations into URA's accounting and management procedures, will help convince the Senate to vote next month to preserve the accelerator and the House of Representatives to reverse its earlier vote to kill the project."
