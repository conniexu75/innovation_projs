https://openalex.org/W3041960835,"Interferons interfere with lung repair Interferons (IFNs) are central to antiviral immunity. Viral recognition elicits IFN production, which in turn triggers the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which engage in various antiviral functions. Type I IFNs (IFN-α and IFN-β) are widely expressed and can result in immunopathology during viral infections. By contrast, type III IFN (IFN-λ) responses are primarily restricted to mucosal surfaces and are thought to confer antiviral protection without driving damaging proinflammatory responses. Accordingly, IFN-λ has been proposed as a therapeutic in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other such viral respiratory diseases (see the Perspective by Grajales-Reyes and Colonna). Broggi et al. report that COVID-19 patient morbidity correlates with the high expression of type I and III IFNs in the lung. Furthermore, IFN-λ secreted by dendritic cells in the lungs of mice exposed to synthetic viral RNA causes damage to the lung epithelium, which increases susceptibility to lethal bacterial superinfections. Similarly, using a mouse model of influenza infection, Major et al. found that IFN signaling (especially IFN-λ) hampers lung repair by inducing p53 and inhibiting epithelial proliferation and differentiation. Complicating this picture, Hadjadj et al. observed that peripheral blood immune cells from severe and critical COVID-19 patients have diminished type I IFN and enhanced proinflammatory interleukin-6– and tumor necrosis factor-α–fueled responses. This suggests that in contrast to local production, systemic production of IFNs may be beneficial. The results of this trio of studies suggest that the location, timing, and duration of IFN exposure are critical parameters underlying the success or failure of therapeutics for viral respiratory infections.

https://openalex.org/W3041564586,"A common theme in antibody responses In the fight against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), antibodies are a key tool, both as potential therapeutics and to guide vaccine development. Yuan et al. focused on finding shared antibody responses, in which multiple individuals develop antibodies against the same antigen using the same genetic elements and modes of recognition. The authors identified the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region 3-53 gene as the most frequently used among 294 antibodies that target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike protein. These antibodies have few somatic mutations, and crystal structures of two neutralizing antibodies bound to the RBD show that mostly germline-encoded residues are involved in binding. The minimal affinity maturation and high potency of these antibodies is promising for vaccine design. Science , this issue p. 1119"
https://openalex.org/W3040725637,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. This possibility requires careful consideration at this critical point in the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we review observations relevant to the risks of ADE of disease, and their potential implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same and designing animal models depends on understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in humans. The implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, because ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies—regardless of what virus is the causative agent—it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward. The antibody-dependent enhancement of disease is reviewed, with an emphasis on implications for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3042332303,"The attenuation of hyper-inflammation in sepsis with the administration of anti-inflammatory macrophages is an interesting adjuvant therapy for sepsis. Because the induction of anti-inflammatory macrophages by microRNA (miR), a regulator of mRNA, has been mentioned, the exploration on miR-induced anti-inflammatory macrophages was performed. The over-expression of miR-223 and miR-146a in RAW264.7 induced M2 macrophage-polarization (anti-inflammatory macrophages) as evaluated by the enhanced expression of Arginase-1 and Fizz. However, miR-223 over-expressed cells demonstrated the more potent anti-inflammatory property against LPS stimulation as lesser iNOS expression, lower supernatant IL-6 and higher supernatant IL-10 compared with miR-146a over-expressed cells. Interestingly, LPS stimulation in miR-223 over-expressed cells, compared with LPS-stimulated control cells, demonstrated lower activity of glycolysis pathway and higher mitochondrial respiration, as evaluated by the extracellular flux analysis, and also down-regulated HIF-1α, an important enzyme of glycolysis pathway. In addition, the administration of miR-223 over-expressed macrophages with IL-4 pre-conditioning, but not IL-4 stimulated control cells, attenuated sepsis severity in LPS injected mice as evaluated by serum creatinine, liver enzymes, lung histology and serum cytokines. In conclusion, miR-223 interfered with the glycolysis pathway through the down-regulation of HIF-1α, resulting in the anti-inflammatory status. The over-expression of miR-223 in macrophages prevented the conversion into M1 macrophage polarization after LPS stimulation. The administration of miR-223 over-expressed macrophages, with IL-4 preconditioning, attenuated sepsis severity in LPS model. Hence, a proof of concept in the induction of anti-inflammatory macrophages through the cell-energy interference for sepsis treatment was proposed as a basis of cell-based therapy in sepsis."

This study aims to determine whether voice quality and speech fluency distinguish patients with MCI from healthy individuals to improve diagnosis of patients with MCI. We analyzed recordings of the Cookie Theft picture description task produced by 26 patients with MCI and 29 healthy controls from Sweden and calculated measures of voice quality and speech fluency. The results show that patients with MCI differ significantly from HC with respect to acoustic aspects of voice quality, namely H1-A3, cepstral peak prominence, center of gravity, and shimmer; and speech fluency, namely articulation rate and averaged speaking time. The method proposed along with the obtainability of connected speech productions can enable quick and easy analysis of speech fluency and voice quality, providing accessible and objective diagnostic markers of patients with MCI."
https://openalex.org/W3040718288,"Repetitive pulmonary injury causes fibrosis and inflammation that underlies chronic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Interleukin 11 (IL11) is important for pulmonary fibroblast activation but the contribution of fibroblast-specific IL11 activity to lung fibro-inflammation is not known. To address this gap in knowledge, we generated mice with loxP-flanked Il11ra1 and deleted the IL11 receptor in adult fibroblasts (CKO mice). In the bleomycin (BLM) model of lung fibrosis, CKO mice had reduced fibrosis, lesser fibroblast ERK activation, and diminished immune cell STAT3 phosphorylation. Following BLM injury, acute inflammation in CKO mice was similar to controls but chronic immune infiltrates and pro-inflammatory gene activation, including NF-kB phosphorylation, were notably reduced. Therapeutic prevention of IL11 activity with neutralizing antibodies mirrored the effects of genetic deletion of Il11ra1 in fibroblasts. These data reveal a new function for IL11 in pro-inflammatory lung fibroblasts and highlight the important contribution of the stroma to inflammation in pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W3042080193,"This paper represents the first article in a series on Yunnanese microfungi. We herein provide insights into Magnolia species associated with microfungi. All presented data are reported from the Kunming Botanical Gardens. Final conclusions were derived from the morphological examination of specimens coupled with phylogenetic sequence data to better integrate taxa into appropriate taxonomic ranks and infer their relationships. Shearia formosa, the type species of Shearia, lacks type material, and its phylogenetic position accordingly remains unresolved. A fresh collection of Shearia formosa, obtained from Magnolia denudata and M. soulangeana in China, therefore, designated a neotype for stabilizing the application of the species and/or genus name. Phylogenetic analyses of a combined DNA data matrix containing SSU, LSU, RPB2 and TEF loci of representative Pleosporales revealed that the genera Crassiperidium, Longiostiolum and Shearia are a well-defined monophylum. It is recognized as the family Longiostiolaceae and strongly supported by Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood methods. Its members are characterized by immersed to semi-immersed, globose to subglobose ascomata with a central, periphysate ostiole, a peridium composed of rectangular to polygonal cells, cylindrical to clavate asci, broadly fusiform, hyaline to pale brown ascospores, a coelomycetous asexual morph with pycnidial conidiomata, enteroblastic, annellidic, ampulliform, doliiform or cylindrical conidiogenous cells and cylindrical to fusiform, transverse and sometimes laterally distoseptate conidia without a sheath or with a basal lateral sheath. Nigrograna magnoliae sp. nov. is introduced from Magnolia denudata with both asexual and sexual morphs. We observed the asexual morph of Brunneofusispora sinensis from the culture and therefore amended the generic and species descriptions of Brunneofusispora."
https://openalex.org/W3042574483,"Approximately 20.5 million infants were born weighing <2500 g (defined as low birthweight or LBW) in 2015, primarily in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Infants born LBW, including those born preterm (<37 weeks gestation), are at increased risk for numerous consequences, including neonatal mortality and morbidity as well as suboptimal health and nutritional status later in life. The objective of this study was to identify predictors of LBW and preterm birth among infants in rural Uganda.Data were derived from a prospective birth cohort study conducted from 2014-2016 in 12 districts across northern and southwestern Uganda. Birth weights were measured in triplicate to the nearest 0.1 kg by trained enumerators within 72 hours of delivery. Gestational age was calculated from the first day of last menstrual period (LMP). Associations between household, maternal, and infant characteristics and birth outcomes (LBW and preterm birth) were assessed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with stepwise, backward selection analyses.Among infants in the study, 4.3% were born LBW (143/3,337), and 19.4% were born preterm (744/3,841). In multivariable analysis, mothers who were taller (>150 cm) (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 0.42 (95% CI = 0.24, 0.72)), multigravida (aOR = 0.62 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.97)), or with adequate birth spacing (>24 months) (aOR = 0.60 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.92)) had lower odds of delivering a LBW infant Mothers with severe household food insecurity (aOR = 1.84 (95% CI = 1.22, 2.79)) or who tested positive for malaria during pregnancy (aOR = 2.06 (95% CI = 1.10, 3.85)) had higher odds of delivering a LBW infant. In addition, in multivariable analysis, mothers who resided in the Southwest (aOR = 0.64 (95% CI = 0.54, 0.76)), were ≥20 years old (aOR = 0.76 (95% CI = 0.61, 0.94)), with adequate birth spacing (aOR = 0.76 (95% CI = 0.63, 0.93)), or attended ≥4 antenatal care (ANC) visits (aOR = 0.56 (95% CI = 0.47, 0.67)) had lower odds of delivering a preterm infant; mothers who were neither married nor cohabitating (aOR = 1.42 (95% CI = 1.00, 2.00)) or delivered at home (aOR = 1.25 (95% CI = 1.04, 1.51)) had higher odds.In rural Uganda, severe household food insecurity, adolescent pregnancy, inadequate birth spacing, malaria infection, suboptimal ANC attendance, and home delivery represent modifiable risk factors associated with higher rates of LBW and/or preterm birth. Future studies on interventions to address these risk factors may be warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3042030854,"The people of Tengger, Indonesia have used plants as traditional medicine for a long time. However, this local knowledge has not been well documented until recently. Our study aims to understand the utilization of plants in traditional medicine by the people of Tengger, who inhabit the Ngadisari village, Sukapura District, Probolinggo Regency, Indonesia. We conducted semi-structured and structured interviews with a total of 52 informants that represented 10% of the total family units in the village. The parameters observed in this study include species use value (SUV), family use value (FUV), plant part use (PPU), and the relative frequency of citation that was calculated based on fidelity level (FL). We successfully identified 30 species belonging to 28 genera and 20 families that have been used as a traditional medicine to treat 20 diseases. We clustered all the diseases into seven distinct categories. Among the recorded plant families, Poaceae and Zingiberaceae were the most abundant. Plant species within those families were used to treat internal medical diseases, respiratory-nose, ear, oral/dental, and throat problems. The plant species with the highest SUV was Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (1.01), whereas the Aloaceae family (0.86) had the highest FUV. Acorus calamus L. (80%) had the highest FL percentage. The leaves were identified as the most used plant part and decoction was the dominant mode of a medicinal preparation. Out of the plants and their uses documented in our study, 26.7% of the medicinal plants and 71.8% of the uses were novel. In conclusion, the diversity of medicinal plant uses in the Ngadisari village could contribute to the development of new plant-based drugs and improve the collective revenue of the local society."
https://openalex.org/W3043380118,"To assess specific risk factors and biomarkers associated with intimal arterial calcification (IAC) and medial arterial calcification (MAC).We conducted a cross-sectional study in patients with or at risk of vascular disease from the SMART study(n = 520) and the DCS cohort(n = 198). Non-contrast computed tomography scanning of the lower extremities was performed and calcification in the femoral and crural arteries was scored as absent, predominant IAC, predominant MAC or indistinguishable. Multinomial regression models were used to assess the associations between cardiovascular risk factors and calcification patterns. Biomarkers for inflammation, calcification and vitamin K status were measured in a subset of patients with IAC(n = 151) and MAC(n = 151).Femoral calcification was found in 77% of the participants, of whom 38% had IAC, 28% had MAC and 11% were scored as indistinguishable. The absolute agreement between the femoral and crural arteries was high(69%). Higher age, male sex, statin use and history of coronary artery disease were associated with higher prevalences of femoral IAC and MAC compared to absence of calcification. Smoking and low ankle-brachial-index (ABI) were associated with higher prevalence of IAC and high ABI was associated with less IAC. Compared to patients with IAC, patients with MAC more often had diabetes, have a high ABI and were less often smokers. Inactive Matrix-Gla Protein was associated with increased MAC prevalence, while osteonectin was associated with decreased risk of MAC, compared to IAC.When femoral calcification is present, the majority of the patients have IAC or MAC throughout the lower extremity, which have different associated risk factor profiles."
https://openalex.org/W3031230415,"Abstract Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related death. This multistage process involves contribution from both tumour cells and the tumour stroma to release metastatic cells into the circulation. Circulating tumour cells (CTCs) survive circulatory cytotoxicity, extravasate and colonise secondary sites effecting metastatic outcome. Reprogramming the transcriptomic landscape is a metastatic hallmark, but detecting underlying master regulators that drive pathological gene expression is a key challenge, especially in childhood cancer. Here we used whole tumour plus single-cell RNA-sequencing in primary bone cancer and CTCs to perform weighted gene co-expression network analysis to systematically detect coordinated changes in metastatic transcript expression. This approach with comparisons applied to data collected from cell line models, clinical samples and xenograft mouse models revealed mitogen-activated protein kinase 7/matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MAPK7/MMP9) signalling as a driver for primary bone cancer metastasis. RNA interference knockdown of MAPK7 reduces proliferation, colony formation, migration, tumour growth, macrophage residency/polarisation and lung metastasis. Parallel to these observations were reduction of activated interleukins IL1B , IL6 , IL8 plus mesenchymal markers VIM and VEGF in response to MAPK7 loss. Our results implicate a newly discovered, multidimensional MAPK7/MMP9 signalling hub in primary bone cancer metastasis that is clinically actionable."
https://openalex.org/W3042792927,"Background Food insecurity, limited access to adequate food, in adulthood is associated with poor health outcomes that suggest a pattern of accelerated aging. However, little is known about factors that impact food insecurity in midlife which in turn could help to identify potential pathways of accelerated aging. Methods Low-income adults (n = 17,866; 2014 National Health Interview Survey), ages 18 to 84, completed a 10-item food security module and answered questions regarding health challenges (chronic conditions and functional limitations) and financial worry. We used multinomial logistic regression for complex samples to assess the association of health challenges and financial worry with food insecurity status and determine whether these associations differed by age group, while adjusting for poverty, sex, race/ethnicity, education, family structure, social security, and food assistance. Results Food insecurity rates were highest in late- (37.5%) and early- (36.0%) midlife, relative to younger (33.7%) and older (20.2%) age groups and, furthermore, age moderated the relationship between food insecurity and both risk factors (interaction p-values < .05, for both). The effects of poor health were stronger in midlife relative to younger and older ages. Unlike younger and older adults, however, adults in midlife showed high levels of food insecurity regardless of financial worry. Conclusions Findings suggest that food insecurity in midlife may be more severe than previously thought. Greater efforts are needed to identify those at greatest risk and intervene early to slow premature aging."
https://openalex.org/W3041311891,"Exposure to high doses of solar long wavelength ultraviolet radiation (UVA) damages human skin via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Whether physiological UVA doses also generate ROS that has an effect on the skin remains unknown. We previously showed that in human epidermal melanocytes UVA activates a G-protein coupled signaling pathway that leads to calcium mobilization and increased melanin. Here, we report that ROS generated by the UVA phototransduction pathway are critical cellular messengers required to augment melanin. Using simultaneous UVA exposure and live-cell imaging of primary human melanocytes, we found that physiological doses of UVA generate two spatiotemporally distinct sources of ROS: one upstream of the G-protein activation that potentiates calcium responses, and another source downstream of calcium, in the mitochondria (ROSmito ). UVA-evoked signaling led to mitochondrial calcium uptake via mitochondrial calcium uniporter to promote ROSmito production leading to melanin synthesis. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism in which ROS function as signaling messengers necessary for melanin production, thus having a protective role in the UVA-induced skin response."
https://openalex.org/W3041612064,"Background Although machine learning-based prediction models for in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) have been widely investigated, it is unknown whether a model based on vital signs alone (Vitals-Only model) can perform similarly to a model that considers both vital signs and laboratory results (Vitals+Labs model). Methods All adult patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital in Japan between October 2011 and October 2018 were included in this study. Random forest models with/without laboratory results (Vitals+Labs model and Vitals-Only model, respectively) were trained and tested using chronologically divided datasets. Both models use patient demographics and eight-hourly vital signs collected within the previous 48 hours. The primary and secondary outcomes were the occurrence of IHCA in the next 8 and 24 hours, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as a comparative measure. Sensitivity analyses were performed under multiple statistical assumptions. Results Of 141,111 admitted patients (training data: 83,064, test data: 58,047), 338 had an IHCA (training data: 217, test data: 121) during the study period. The Vitals-Only model and Vitals+Labs model performed comparably when predicting IHCA within the next 8 hours (Vitals-Only model vs Vitals+Labs model, AUC = 0.862 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.855–0.868] vs 0.872 [95% CI: 0.867–0.878]) and 24 hours (Vitals-Only model vs Vitals+Labs model, AUC = 0.830 [95% CI: 0.825–0.835] vs 0.837 [95% CI: 0.830–0.844]). Both models performed similarly well on medical, surgical, and ward patient data, but did not perform well for intensive care unit patients. Conclusions In this single-center study, the machine learning model predicted IHCAs with good discrimination. The addition of laboratory values to vital signs did not significantly improve its overall performance."
https://openalex.org/W3042521318,"Research suggests that medical students as well as women are at greater risk of depression compared to the general population and men. This suggests that female medical students are crucial targets requiring specific monitoring for mental health disorder prevention and intervention. However, little is known regarding the risk factors for poor mental health among this population. Therefore, we investigated whether menstrual symptoms and nutritional status are associated with psychological distress in Japanese female medical students.This cross-sectional study assessed 326 female medical students who attended a school medical check-up, which included blood sampling in 2018. The levels of psychological distress were evaluated using the Japanese General Health Questionnaire (J-GHQ)-30. We defined high GHQ scores as GHQ-30 ≥7. We checked dysmenorrhea levels and assessed menstrual symptoms according to the presence of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Dysmenorrhea was evaluated according to quartiles of the sum of the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ). PMS was assessed using the Premenstrual Symptoms Questionnaire (PSQ). We evaluated levels of serum albumin, hemoglobin, ferritin, and lipid metabolite as nutritional factors. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between menstrual-related symptoms or nutritional factors and the levels of psychological distress.A total of 45 female medical students (15%) experienced psychological distress. Serum albumin levels were associated with psychological distress, while lipid metabolite levels were not. The intensity of dysmenorrhea and the presence of PMS were associated with psychological distress, independent of nutritional status.Both menstrual symptoms and nutrition markers were associated with the levels of psychological distress in Japanese female medical students. School doctors and nurses can help improve the mental health of young female medical students by encouraging a healthy diet and checking for the presence of menstrual symptoms."

Interestingly, D76N-associated amyloidosis has a distinctive pathology compared with aggregation of WT-β2m, which occurs in dialysis-related amyloidosis. A folding intermediate of WT-β2m, known as the IT-state, which contains a nonnative trans Pro-32, has been shown to be a key precursor of WT-β2m aggregation in vitro. However, how a single amino acid substitution enhances the rate of aggregation of D76N-β2m and gives rise to a different amyloid disease remained unclear. Using real-time refolding experiments monitored by CD and NMR, we show that the folding mechanisms of WT- and D76N-β2m are conserved in that both proteins fold slowly via an IT-state that has similar structural properties. Surprisingly, however, direct measurement of the equilibrium population of IT using NMR showed no evidence for an increased population of the IT-state for D76N-β2m, ruling out previous models suggesting that this could explain its enhanced aggregation propensity. Producing a kinetically trapped analog of IT by deleting the N-terminal six amino acids increases the aggregation rate of WT-β2m but slows aggregation of D76N-β2m, supporting the view that although the folding mechanisms of the two proteins are conserved, their aggregation mechanisms differ.

Consistent with this finding, a truncated form of WT-β2m in which the N-terminal six residues have been removed, enabling relaxation of Pro-32 from cis to trans, aggregates more rapidly than WT-β2m, presumably because this variant (known as ΔN6-β2m) cannot escape the IT-state (16Eichner T.

ΔN6-β2m is thus a structural mimic of the IT-state, and this is supported by the similarity of its 1H-15N-HSQC and far-UV CD spectra with those of the IT-state populated transiently during real-time refolding experiments (12Kameda A.

In 2012, the first naturally occurring β2m variant was identified in a French family as the causative agent of a hereditary, late-onset, fatal, and systemic amyloid disease (17Valleix S.

Various studies have been performed to try to rationalize the difference in the aggregation propensities of WT- and D76N-β2m. Because the IT-state is known to be critically important for WT-β2m aggregation, the folding pathway of D76N-β2m was investigated by Mangione et al. (22Mangione P.P. Esposito G. Relini A. Raimondi S.

These experiments suggested that D76N-β2m folds similarly to WT-β2m, with an initial rapid phase followed by a slow phase corresponding to the trans to cis isomerization of Pro-32 (22Mangione P.P.

Based on analysis of the kinetic data, the authors concluded that D76N-β2m populates the IT-state to ∼25% at equilibrium, in marked contrast with its population of only ∼5% for WT-β2m, rationalizing the increased amyloidogenicity of D76N-β2m (22Mangione P.P.

In silico studies have also suggested that the IT-state of D76N-β2m is structurally distinct from that of WT-β2m (23Chong S.H. Hong J. Lim S. Cho S. Lee J. Ham S.

Indeed, one such report suggested that the D76N-β2m IT-state has a larger solvent-exposed surface area, a more disordered D-strand and a greater solvation-free energy than the WT-β2m IT-state, all of which were proposed to contribute to the enhanced aggregation propensity of the protein (23Chong S.H. Hong J. Lim S. Cho S. Lee J. Ham S. Structural and thermodynamic characteristics of amyloidogenic intermediates of β-2-microglobulin.Sci. Rep. 2015; 5 (26348154)1363110.1038/srep13631Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Alternative models (25Loureiro J.S.R. Vila-Viçosa D. Machuqueiro M. Shakhnovich E.I. Faísca F.N.P. The early phase of β2m aggregation: An integrative computational study framed on the D76N mutant and the ΔN6 variant.Biomolecules. 2019; 9 (31416179): 36610.3390/biom9080366Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar) suggest instead that D76N-β2m forms two different IT-state structures: the first being the same as the WT-β2m IT-state and the second being unique to D76N-β2m by having unfolded N- and C-terminal regions. Interestingly, the second D76N-β2m IT-state was suggested to be more prone to oligomerization, its formation thus rationalizing the rapid aggregation of D76N-β2m (25Loureiro J.S.R. Vila-Viçosa D.

To cast more light on the reasons for the enhanced amyloidogenicity of D76N-β2m, and specifically to distinguish between these different models, we analyzed the population and structure of the D76N-β2m IT-state directly, using real-time refolding experiments monitored by far-UV CD and heteronuclear NMR. These experiments provide direct structural and kinetic insights into the intermediate(s) formed during folding (26Zhuravleva A. Korzhnev D.M. Protein folding by NMR.Prog. Nucl. Magn. Reson.

The aggregation propensity of the D76N-β2m IT-state was also probed via the generation of an IT-state structural mimic at equilibrium by truncation of the N-terminal six amino acids of D76N-β2m (named ΔN6-D76N-β2m), inspired by the ΔN6-β2m variant (16Eichner T. Kalverda A.P. Thompson G.S. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Conformational conversion during amyloid formation at atomic resolution.Mol.

These results revealed that D76N-β2m folds through an IT-state that structurally mimics the IT-state of WT-β2m. Importantly, direct measurement of the population of the D76N-β2m IT-state at equilibrium using NMR revealed that this species is only rarely populated at equilibrium (the IT-state is below the detection threshold of 1H-15N-HSQC experiments at equilibrium) ruling out models that suggest an enhanced concentration of the IT-state as the rationale for the increased aggregation kinetics of D76N-β2m. Instead, we posit that the mutation of Asp to Asn, specifically at position 76 (27de Rosa M. Barbiroli A. Giorgetti S. Mangione P.P. Bolognesi M. Ricagno S. Decoding the structural bases of D76N β2-microglobulin high amyloidogenicity through crystallography and Asn-scan mutagenesis.PLoS One. 2015; 10 (26625273)e014406110.1371/journal.pone.0144061Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), alters the aggregation mechanism of β2m substantially, such that the rate of aggregation no longer depends on the structure or concentration of the IT state. Despite sharing a common immunoglobulin fold and differing only in a single amino acid substitution at a solvent-exposed site (Fig. 1a), D76N-β2m aggregates rapidly at neutral pH, whereas WT-β2m does not aggregate into amyloid fibrils under the same conditions in vitro (Fig. 1b) (17Valleix S. Gillmore J.D. Bridoux F. Mangione P.P. Dogan A. Nedelec B. Boimard M. Touchard G. Goujon J.M. Lacombe C. Lozeron P. Adams D. Lacroix C. Maisonobe T.

This raises the possibility that the difference in aggregation behavior of the two proteins could result from differences in (i) the population of a common amyloidogenic IT-state, (ii) the structural properties of the IT-state, or (iii) the proteins' aggregation mechanisms, such that D76N-β2m does not aggregate via the IT-state. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined the conformational properties of the IT-states of WT- and D76N-β2m by real-time folding experiments monitored using far-UV CD and compared them with those of ΔN6-β2m. D76N- and WT-β2m have essentially identical native protein structures with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.3 Å (Fig. 1a) as well as identical far-UV CD spectra (Fig. S1). Despite an RMSD between ΔN6- and WT- or D76N-β2m of only 1.8 Å and 1.9 Å, respectively (Fig. 1a), the far-UV CD spectrum of ΔN6-β2m has a larger negative maximum at 216 nm than WT- or D76N-β2m (Fig. S1), presumably resulting from differences in the arrangement of aromatic side chains in the core of the proteins (14Eichner T. Radford S.E. A generic mechanism of β2-microglobulin amyloid assembly at neutral pH involving a specific proline switch.J. Mol.

Analysis of the CD spectra of Pro-32 variants of β2m reported similar differences, and showed (assuming a two-state model) that the relative population of the IT- and N-states at equilibrium can be deduced directly from these spectra (14Eichner T. Radford S.E. A generic mechanism of β2-microglobulin amyloid assembly at neutral pH involving a specific proline switch.J. Mol.

Building on these results, WT- and D76N-β2m were each unfolded at acidic pH (see “Experimental procedures”). Folding was then initiated by rapidly increasing the pH to 7.4, and far-UV CD spectra were acquired as a function of time until folding was complete (Fig. 2, a and b). ΔN6-β2m, which is trapped at equilibrium in an IT-like state at pH 7.4, was similarly treated and included for comparison (Fig. 2c). The results showed, as expected (22Mangione P.P. Esposito G.

Subsequent to this transition, slow refolding to the N-state occurs, which involves a decrease in signal intensity in the far-UV CD (Fig. 2, a and b). The refolding rate constant for this phase, which maps the IT- to N-state transition, was 1.03 × 10−3 ± 0.03 × 10−3 s−1 and 1.27 × 10−3 ± 0.03 × 10−3 s−1 for WT- and D76N-β2m, respectively, indicating that WT- and D76N-β2m fold to the N-state with similar rates (Fig. 2, a and b). Consistent with this interpretation, the slow phase is absent for ΔN6-β2m as this variant remains trapped in an IT-like state (Fig. 2c). These experiments confirm previous results which suggested that D76N-β2m folds slowly to its N-state via an IT-like species (16Eichner T. Kalverda A.P. Thompson G.S. Homans S.W. Radford S.E.

To obtain more detailed information about the structural properties of the D76N-β2m IT-state, refolding was also monitored in real-time using NMR. We first obtained a full backbone resonance assignment for native D76N-β2m, as this information was not available in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) (see “Experimental procedures”). Refolding experiments were initiated by rapidly increasing the pH of the acid-unfolded proteins to pH 7.4. The first 1H-15N-SOFAST-HMQC spectra of WT- and D76N-β2m obtained 90 s after the initiation of refolding show well-dispersed peaks, consistent with the presence of the structured IT-state, which is expected to dominate the refolding reaction at this time point (Fig. 3a and Figs. S2 and S4). It is interesting to note that ∼14 and ∼13% of the species populated at this time correspond to native WT- and D76N-β2m, respectively, as judged by the intensity of resonances unique to the N-state in each spectrum. Importantly, these spectra are distinct from those of the earlier intermediate of WT-β2m (I1) and murine β2m observed previously using nonuniform sampling NMR methods, which gives rise to very broad spectra and species shown not to be amyloidogenic (29Karamanos T.K.

https://openalex.org/W3041806606,"Sorafenib represents the current standard of care for patients with advanced-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, acquired drug resistance occurs frequently during therapy and is accompanied by rapid tumor regrowth after sorafenib therapy termination. To identify the mechanism of this therapy-limiting growth resumption, we established robust sorafenib resistance HCC cell models that exhibited mitochondrial dysfunction and chemotherapeutic crossresistance. We found a rapid relapse of tumor cell proliferation after sorafenib withdrawal, which was caused by renewal of mitochondrial structures alongside a metabolic switch toward high electron transport system (ETS) activity. The translation-inhibiting antibiotic tigecycline impaired the biogenesis of mitochondrial DNA-encoded ETS subunits and limited the electron acceptor turnover required for glutamine oxidation. Thereby, tigecycline prevented the tumor relapse in vitro and in murine xenografts in vivo. These results offer a promising second-line therapeutic approach for advanced-stage HCC patients with progressive disease undergoing sorafenib therapy or treatment interruption due to severe adverse events."
https://openalex.org/W3041812464,"The dysfunction of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in osteogenic differentiation is one of the main causes of age-related bone loss. Our previous studies have shown that low-magnitude vibration (LMV) induces the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs derived from ovariectomized osteoporotic rats. To investigate whether LMV promotes osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and its underlying mechanisms in aged rats, 20-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 20) were randomly divided into LMV group (rats were vibrated at 0.3 g and 90 Hz for 30 minutes, once daily, 5 days a week until 12 weeks for subsequent analysis, n = 10), static group (rats were placed in the box on the vibration platform without vibration, n = 10); 6-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were used as control (young group, n = 10). The bone mineral density and bone strength of aged rats were significantly decreased compared with the young rats. Furthermore, the primary BMSCs isolated and cultured from the aged rats with the whole-bone marrow differential pasting method showed a decreased ability in osteogenic differentiation compared with that from the young rats. Then the differentially expressed miRNAs between the aged and young rat-derived BMSCs were screened by high-throughput sequencing and verified by qRT-PCR, and we found that miR-378a-3p was significantly downregulated in the aged rat-derived BMSCs compared with the young rat-derived BMSCs. By transfecting miRNA mimics and inhibitors, miR-378a-3p was confirmed to promote the expression levels of osteogenic genes (Runx2, ALP, Col I, and OCN) and ALP activity of the aged rat-derived BMSCs. Meanwhile, the expression levels of osteogenic genes and miR-378a-3p of aged rat-derived BMSCs were significantly upregulated by LMV (cells were vibrated at 0.3 g and 90 Hz for 30 minutes a day, until 5 days for subsequent analysis), while the LMV-induced osteogenic gene expression levels of aged rat-derived BMSCs were suppressed by miR-378a-3p inhibitors. Furthermore, the inhibition of growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) by miR-378a-3p and Grb2-siRNA promoted the LMV-induced osteogenic differentiation of aged rat-derived BMSCs. Additionally, LMV was found to promote bone mineral density and bone strength of aged rats in vivo, as well as upregulating the expression level of miR-378a-3p and downregulating the expression level of Grb2 of BMSCs from aged rats. These results suggest that LMV induces osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through miR-378a-3p/Grb2 pathway to improve bone mineral density and mechanical properties in a rat model of age-related bone loss."
https://openalex.org/W3042056333,"We are currently facing a large decline in bee populations worldwide. Who are the winners and losers? Generalist bee species, notably those able to shift their diet to new or alternative floral resources, are expected to be among the least vulnerable to environmental change. However, studies of interactions between bees and plants over large temporal and geographical scales are limited by a lack of historical records. Here, we used a unique opportunistic century-old countrywide database of bee specimens collected on plants to track changes in the plant-bee interaction network over time. In each historical period considered, and using a network-based modularity analysis, we identified some major groups of species interacting more with each other than with other species (i.e. modules). These modules were related to coherent functional groups thanks to an a posteriory trait-based analysis. We then compared over time the ecological specialization of bees in the network by computing their degree of interaction within and between modules. “True” specialist species (or peripheral species) are involved in few interactions both inside and between modules. We found a global loss of specialist species and specialist strategies. This means that bee species observed in each period tended to use more diverse floral resources from different ecological groups over time, highly specialist species tending to enter/leave the network. Considering the role and functional traits of species in the network, combined with a long-term time series, provides a new perspective for the study of species specialization."
https://openalex.org/W3043169336,"Vernonia amygdalina (VA) has been reported to have antioxidant potential; however, its DNA protection and anti-inflammatory properties remain unclear. We aimed to investigate whether aqueous (WEVAL) and alcoholic (EEVAL) VA extracts exert similar antioxidant, DNA protection and anti-inflammatory effects and attempted to explore the mechanism underlying the anti-inflammatory effects. These results demonstrated that WEVAL had greater polyphenolic and flavonoid contents, as well as a stronger reducing power, DPPH radical scavenging and DNA protective activity. Moreover, both extracts reduced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of COX-II, iNOS, pro-inflammatory factors, including NO, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-10. Compared with WEVAL, EEVAL was a more potent inflammatory inhibitor. Both extracts similarly inhibited LPS-induced MAPK (p38) and NF-κB expression. Our findings indicate that WEVAL and EEVAL have diverse antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. WEVAL had a stronger antioxidant and DNA protection activity; contrastingly, EEVAL had a stronger anti-inflammatory ability. The anti-inflammatory activity involves reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines through NF-κB down-regulation and MAPK inhibition. These results demonstrated that production of WEVAL and EEVAL from VA leaves may provide a safe and efficacious source of pharmaceutical applications, with antioxidant, DNA protective and anti-inflammation activities."
https://openalex.org/W3041144101,"Surveys of microbial populations in environmental niches of interest often utilize sequence variation in the gene encoding the ribosomal small subunit (the 16S rRNA gene). Generally, these surveys target the 16S genes using semi-degenerate primers to amplify portions of a subset of bacterial species, sequence the amplicons in bulk, and assign to putative taxonomic categories by comparison to databases purporting to connect specific sequences in the main variable regions of the gene to specific organisms. Due to sequence length constraints of the most popular bulk sequencing platforms, the primers selected amplify one to three of the nine variable regions, and taxonomic assignment is based on relatively short stretches of sequence (150-500 bases). We demonstrate that taxonomic assignment is improved through reduced unassigned reads by including a survey of near-full-length sequences specific to the target environment, using a niche of interest represented by the upper respiratory tract (URT) of cattle. We created a custom Bovine URT database from these longer sequences for assignment of shorter, less expensive reads in comparisons of the upper respiratory tract among individual animals. This process improves the ability to detect changes in the microbial populations of a given environment, and the accuracy of defining the content of that environment at increasingly higher taxonomic resolution."
https://openalex.org/W3041285109,"The tight junction (TJ) and barrier function of colonic epithelium is highly sensitive to ionizing radiation. We evaluated the effect of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and its analog, Radioprotein-1, on γ-radiation-induced colonic epithelial barrier dysfunction using Caco-2 and m-ICC12 cell monolayers in vitro and mice in vivo. Mice were subjected to either total body irradiation (TBI) or partial body irradiation (PBI-BM5). Intestinal barrier function was assessed by analyzing immunofluorescence localization of TJ proteins, mucosal inulin permeability, and plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels. Oxidative stress was analyzed by measuring protein thiol oxidation and antioxidant mRNA. In Caco-2 and m-ICC12 cell monolayers, LPA attenuated radiation-induced redistribution of TJ proteins, which was blocked by a Rho-kinase inhibitor. In mice, TBI and PBI-BM5 disrupted colonic epithelial tight junction and adherens junction, increased mucosal permeability, and elevated plasma LPS; TJ disruption by TBI was more severe in Lpar2−/− mice compared to wild-type mice. RP1, administered before or after irradiation, alleviated TBI and PBI-BM5-induced TJ disruption, barrier dysfunction, and endotoxemia accompanied by protein thiol oxidation and downregulation of antioxidant gene expression, cofilin activation, and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. These data demonstrate that LPAR2 receptor activation prevents and mitigates γ-irradiation-induced colonic mucosal barrier dysfunction and endotoxemia."
https://openalex.org/W3042753514,"Objective To identify health systems-level barriers to treatment for women who screened positive for high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) in a cervical cancer prevention program in Kenya. Methods In a trial of implementation strategies for hrHPV-based cervical cancer screening in western Kenya in 2018–2019, women underwent hrHPV testing offered through community health campaigns, and women who tested positive were referred to government health facilities for cryotherapy. The current analysis draws on treatment data from this trial, as well as two observational studies that were conducted: 1) periodic assessments of the treatment sites to ascertain availability of resources for treatment and 2) surveys with treatment providers to elicit their views on barriers to care. Bivariate analyses were performed for the site assessment data, and the provider survey data were analyzed descriptively. Results Seventeen site assessments were performed across three treatment sites. All three sites reported instances of supply stockouts, two sites reported treatment delays due to lack of supplies, and two sites reported treatment delays due to provider factors. Of the 16 providers surveyed, ten (67%) perceived lack of knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer as the main barrier in women’s decision to get treated, and seven (47%) perceived financial barriers for transportation and childcare as the main barrier to accessing treatment. Eight (50%) endorsed that providing treatment free of cost was the greatest facilitator of treatment. Conclusion Patient education and financial support to reach treatment are potential areas for intervention to increase rates of hrHPV+ women presenting for treatment. It is also essential to eliminate barriers that prevent treatment of women who present, including ensuring adequate supplies and staff for treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3042907793,"The aim of this study was to define histo-morphological stroma characteristics by analyzing stromal components, and to evaluate their impact on local and systemic tumor spread and overall survival in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC).Patients who underwent oncologic resections with curative intent for PDAC were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Histological specimens were re-evaluated for morphological stroma features as stromal fibers, fibroblast morphology, stroma matrix density, microvessel density and distribution of immune cell populations.A total of 108 patients were identified undergoing curative resection for PDAC in the period from 2011-2016. 33 (30.6%) patients showed parallel alignment of stroma fibers while 75 (69.4%) had randomly oriented stroma fibers. As compared to parallel alignment, random orientation of stroma fibers was associated with larger tumor size (median 3.62 cm vs. median 2.87cm, p = 0.037), nodal positive disease (76.0% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.040), higher margin positive resection rates (41.9% vs. 15.2%, p = 0.008) and a trend for higher rates of T3/4 tumors (33.3% vs. 15.2%, p = 0.064). In univariate analysis, patients with parallel alignment of stroma fibers had improved overall survival rates as compared to patients with random orientation of stroma fibers (42 months vs. 22 months, p = 0.046). The combination of random orientation of stroma fibers and low microvessel density was associated with impaired overall survival rates (16 months vs. 36 months, p = 0.019). A high CD4/CD3 ratio (16 months vs. 33 months, p = 0.040) and high stromal density of CD163 positive cells were associated with reduced overall survival (27 months vs. 34 months, p = 0.039). In multivariable analysis, the combination of random orientation of stroma fibers and low microvessel density (HR 1.592, 95%CI 1.098-2.733, p = 0.029), high CD4/CD3 ratio (HR 2.044, 95%CI 1.203-3.508, p = 0.028) and high density of CD163 positive cells (HR 1.596, 95%CI 1.367-1.968, p = 0.036) remained independent prognostic factors.Alignment of stroma fibers and microvessel density are simple histomorphological features serving as surrogate markers of local tumor progression dissemination and surgical resectability and determine prognosis in PDAC patients. High CD4/CD3 ratio and CD163 positive cell counts determine poor prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3043218249,"A trailing joint control pattern, during which a single joint is rotated actively and the mechanical effect of this motion is used to move the other joints, was previously observed during simplified, laboratory-based tasks. We examined whether this simple pattern also underlies control of complex, unconstrained arm movements of daily activities. Six tasks were analyzed. Using kinematic data, we estimated motion of 7 degrees of freedom (DOF) of the shoulder, elbow, and wrist, and the contribution of muscle and passive interaction and gravitational torques to net torque at each joint. Despite task variety, the hand was transported predominantly by shoulder and elbow flexion/extension, although shoulder external/internal rotation also contributed in some tasks. The other DOF were used to orient the hand in space. The trailing pattern represented by production of net torque by passive torques at the shoulder or elbow or both was observed during the biggest portion of each movement. Net torque generation by muscle torque at both joints simultaneously was mainly limited to movement initiation toward the targets and movement termination when returning to the initial position, and associated with needing to overcome gravity. The results support the interpretation of previous studies that prevalence of the trailing pattern is a feature of skillful, coordinated movements. The simplicity of the trailing pattern is promising for quantification of dyscoordination caused by motor disorders and formulation of straightforward instructions to facilitate rehabilitation and motor learning."
https://openalex.org/W3041234750,"Previous research found that below-knee prosthesis users proactively increase their lateral margin-of-stability on their impaired side in anticipation of an impending perturbation when the timing is predictable and potentially directed toward the impaired limb. While knowledge of perturbation timing and direction influences proactive strategies, the consequences of such knowledge and anticipatory behavior on recovery from perturbations is unclear. This study characterized center-of-mass (CoM) dynamics of below-knee prosthesis users and non-impaired controls following a lateral perturbation when the perturbation direction is known but a priori knowledge of the timing of perturbation is either known or unknown. Across groups, CoM displacement during perturbation exposure increased when directed towards the impaired or non-dominant limb with no influence of timing knowledge. In addition, peak CoM displacement was less with known timing irrespective of the perturbation direction. Generally, the CoM displacement during perturbation exposure correlated well with the CoM medial-lateral velocity during unperturbed walking, supporting evidence that human response dynamics to lateral perturbations are influenced by the instantaneous state of the body’s momentum."
https://openalex.org/W3041668056,"Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) affects millions of people worldwide and presents a large social and personal burden. Pharmacological activation of SIRT3, a regulator of the mitochondrial oxidative stress response, has a protective effect on hearing thresholds after traumatic noise damage in mice. In contrast, the role of endogenously activated SIRT3 in hearing recovery has not been established. Here we tested the hypothesis that SIRT3 is required in mice for recovery of auditory thresholds after a noise exposure that confers a temporary threshold shift (TTS). SIRT3-specific immunoreactivity is present in outer hair cells, around the post-synaptic regions of inner hair cells, and faintly within inner hair cells. Prior to noise exposure, homozygous Sirt3-KO mice have slightly but significantly higher thresholds than their wild-type littermates measured by the auditory brainstem response (ABR), but not by distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Moreover, homozygous Sirt3-KO mice display a significant reduction in the progression of their peak 1 amplitude at higher frequencies prior to noise exposure. After exposure to a single sub-traumatic noise dose that does not permanently reduce cochlear function, compromise cell survival, or damage synaptic structures in wild-type mice, there was no difference in hearing function between the two genotypes, measured by ABR and DPOAE. The numbers of hair cells and auditory synapses were similar in both genotypes before and after noise exposure. These loss-of-function studies complement previously published gain-of-function studies and help refine our understanding of SIRT3's role in cochlear homeostasis under different damage paradigms. They suggest that SIRT3 may promote spiral ganglion neuron function. They imply that cellular mechanisms of homeostasis, in addition to the mitochondrial oxidative stress response, act to restore hearing after TTS. Finally, we present a novel application of a biomedical statistical analysis for identifying changes between peak 1 amplitude progressions in ABR waveforms after damage."
https://openalex.org/W3042145981,"Werner syndrome protein (WRN) plays critical roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair, as well as transcription and cellular senescence. Ubiquitination and degradation of WRN have been reported, however, the E3 ubiquitin ligase of WRN is little known. Here, we identify mindbomb E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (MIB1) as a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase for WRN protein. MIB1 physically interacts with WRN in vitro and in vivo and induces ubiquitination and degradation of WRN in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Camptothecin (CPT) enhances the interaction between MIB1 and WRN, and promotes WRN degradation in a MIB1-dependent manner. In addition, CPT-induced cellular senescence is facilitated by the expression of MIB1 and attenuated by WRN expression. Our results show that MIB1-mediated degradation of WRN promotes cellular senescence and reveal a novel model executed by MIB1 and WRN to regulate cellular senescence."
https://openalex.org/W3041798479,"Studies concerning the mechanical properties of the human periodontal ligament under dynamic compression are rare. This study aimed to determine the viscoelastic properties of the human periodontal ligament under dynamic compressive loading. Ten human incisor specimens containing 5 maxillary central incisors and 5 maxillary lateral incisors were used in a dynamic mechanical analysis. Frequency sweep tests were performed under the selected frequencies between 0.05 Hz and 5 Hz with a compression amplitude that was 2% of the PDL’s initial width. The compressive strain varied over a range of 4%-8% of the PDL’s initial width. The storage modulus, ranging from 28.61 MPa to 250.21 MPa, increased with the increase in frequency. The loss modulus (from 6.00 MPa to 49.28 MPa) also increased with frequency from 0.05 Hz– 0.5 Hz but remained constant when the frequency was higher than 0.5 Hz. The tanδ showed a negative logarithmic correlation with frequency. The dynamic moduli and the loss tangent of the central incisor were higher than those of the lateral incisor. This study concluded that the human PDL exhibits viscoelastic behavior under compressive loadings within the range of the used frequency, 0.05 Hz– 5 Hz. The tooth position and testing frequency may have effects on the viscoelastic properties of PDL."
https://openalex.org/W3042973067,"PRESENILIN 2 (PSEN2) is one of the genes mutated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease (EOfAD). PSEN2 shares significant amino acid sequence identity with another EOfAD-related gene PRESENILIN 1 (PSEN1), and partial functional redundancy is seen between these two genes. However, the complete range of functions of PSEN1 and PSEN2 is not yet understood. In this study, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the zebrafish psen2 gene to generate a premature termination codon close downstream of the translation start with the intention of creating a null mutation. Homozygotes for this mutation, psen2S4Ter, are viable and fertile, and adults do not show any gross psen2-dependent pigmentation defects, arguing against significant loss of γ-secretase activity. Also, assessment of the numbers of Dorsal Longitudinal Ascending (DoLA) interneurons that are responsive to psen2 but not psen1 activity during embryogenesis did not reveal decreased psen2 function. Transcripts containing the S4Ter mutation show no evidence of destabilization by nonsense-mediated decay. Forced expression in zebrafish embryos of fusions of psen2S4Ter 5' mRNA sequences with sequence encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) indicated that the psen2S4Ter mutation permits utilization of cryptic, novel downstream translation start codons. These likely initiate translation of N-terminally truncated Psen2 proteins lacking late endosomal/lysosomal localization sequences and that obey the ""reading frame preservation rule"" of PRESENILIN EOfAD mutations. Transcriptome analysis of entire brains from a 6-month-old family of wild type, heterozygous and homozygous psen2S4Ter female siblings revealed profoundly dominant effects on gene expression likely indicating changes in ribosomal, mitochondrial, and anion transport functions."
https://openalex.org/W3043795809,"Hepatitis E virus is a zoonotic pathogen for which pigs are recognized as the major reservoir in industrialised countries. A multiscale model was developed to assess the HEV transmission and persistence pattern in the pig production sector through an integrative approach taking into account within-farm dynamics and animal movements based on actual data. Within-farm dynamics included both demographic and epidemiological processes. Direct contact and environmental transmission routes were considered along with the possible co-infection with immunomodulating viruses (IMVs) known to modify HEV infection dynamics. Movements were limited to 3,017 herds forming the largest community on the swine commercial network in France and data from the national pig movement database were used to build the contact matrix. Between-herd transmission was modelled by coupling within-herd and network dynamics using the SimInf package. Different introduction scenarios were tested as well as a decrease in the prevalence of IMV-infected farms. After introduction of a single infected gilt, the model showed that the transmission pathway as well as the prevalence of HEV-infected pigs at slaughter age were affected by the type of the index farm, the health status of the population and the type of the infected farms. These outcomes could help design HEV control strategies at a territorial scale based on the assessment of the farms' and network's risk."
https://openalex.org/W3041072269,"The stalk-eyed flies (Diopsidae, Diptera) are a family of approximately 100 species of calypterate dipterans, characterised by extended head capsules. Species within the family have previously been shown to possess six subfamilies of mariner transposons, with nucleotide substitution patterns suggesting that at least two subfamilies are currently active. The vertumnana subfamily has been shown to have been involved in a horizontal transfer event involving Diopsidae and a second dipteran family in the Tephritidae. Presented here are cloned and sequenced mariner elements from three further diopsid species, in addition to a bioinformatic analysis of mariner elements identified in transcriptomic and genomic data from the genus Teleopsis. The newly identified mariner elements predominantly fall into previously recognised subfamilies, however the publicly available Teleopsis data also revealed a novel subfamily. Three of the seven identified subfamilies are shown to have undergone horizontal transfer, two of which appear to involve diopsid donor species. One recipient group of a diopsid mariner is the Bactrocera genus of tephritid flies, the transfer of which was previously proposed in an earlier study of diopsid mariner elements. The second horizontal transfer, of the mauritiana subfamily, can be traced from the Teleopsis genus to the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris. The mauritiana elements are shown to be active in the recipient H. vulgaris and transposase expression is observed in all body tissues examined in both species. The increased diversity of diopsid mariner elements points to a minimum of four subfamilies being present in the ancestral genome. Both vertical inheritance and stochastic loss of TEs have subsequently occurred within the diopsid radiation. The TE complement of H. vulgaris contains at least two mariner subfamilies of insect origin. Despite the phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient species, both subfamilies are shown to be active and proliferating within H. vulgaris."

Dietary protein is vital for fetus and mother but the effects of protein undernutrition on the maternal skeleton and skeletal muscles are largely unknown. We used mouse dams fed with normal (N, 20%) or low (L, 8%) protein diet during gestation and lactation and maintained on the same diets (NN, LL) or switched from low to normal (LN) during a 28 d skeletal restoration period post lactation. Skeletal muscle morphology and neuromuscular junction integrity was not different between any of the groups. However, dams fed the low protein diet showed extensive bone loss by the end of lactation, followed by full skeletal recovery in NN dams, partial recovery in LN and poor bone recovery in LL dams. Primary osteoblasts from low protein diet fed mice showed decreased in vitro bone formation and decreased osteogenic marker gene expression; promoter methylation analysis by pyrosequencing showed no differences in Bmpr1a, Ptch1, Sirt1, Osx, and Igf1r osteoregulators, while miR-26a, -34a, and -125b expression was found altered in low protein fed mice. Therefore, normal protein diet is indispensable for maternal musculoskeletal health during the reproductive period."
https://openalex.org/W3042243229,"Background Generic medicines are similar to innovator medicine in terms of safety, quality, efficacy, dosage form, strength, and route of administration. They have the same therapeutic use to innovator medicines and available at a far lower price. However, health professionals' poor knowledge and attitude may limit its utilization. The present study aimed at assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practice of pharmacy professionals towards generic medicines in Harar city, Eastern Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among community pharmacists in Harar city. A self-administered thirty-three item questionnaire on Knowledge, attitude, and practice of community pharmacists was utilized. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the determinants of knowledge and attitude of pharmacists. An odds ratio at 95% confidence interval along with a p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results Among 80 community pharmacists’ approached, 74 completed the survey, providing a response rate of 92.5%. Sixty-seven percent of the respondents knew that generic drugs are bioequivalent to brand drugs and claimed generic medicines are cheaper (86.5%). Nearly half (48.6%) of participants believe that generic medicines are less effective and slower in the onset of action (58.1%). More than half (54.1%) of study participants revealed their lack of belief in generic medicine as a factor hindering the selection and dispensing of generic medicines. In multivariate logistic regression, experience in community pharmacy practice (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR = 2.18, 95%CI: 1.21–63.1) and Sex (AOR = 3.88, 95%CI: 2.12–39.62) were significantly associated with knowledge and attitude toward generic medicines, respectively. Conclusion The current study revealed that there is a gap in the knowledge and attitude of community pharmacists towards generic and brand drugs. More than averages of the respondents have known the concept of generic medicine including their right to perform generic substitution and had a positive attitude toward generics. Female pharmacists were more likely to have a positive attitude and the overall knowledge was higher in those who have more than 5 years of work experience."
https://openalex.org/W3042491081,"Based on microRNA (miR) microarray analysis, we previously found that miR22-5p expression is decreased in the mid-luteal endometrium of women with minimal/mild endometriosis. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that miR22-5p targets ten-eleven translocation (TET2) 3'-untranslated region. This study aimed to determine the regulation and roles of miR22-5p in the pathogenesis of minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility. MiR22-5p and TET2 expression in the mid-luteal endometrium from women with or without minimal/mild endometriosis was analyzed. After transfection with miR22-5p mimics or inhibitor, TET2 expression was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription (RT-q) PCR, western blotting and immunohistochemistry. 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine was determined by immunofluorescence and dot blotting. Expression and promoter methylation of estrogen receptor 2 (ESR2) was measured by RT-qPCR and western blotting, and by bisulfite sequencing, respectively. We first established that miR22-5p expression decreased and TET2 expression increased in minimal/mild endometriosis during implantation window. TET2 was found to be a direct target of miR22-5p. MiR22-5p regulated the expression of ESR2, but did not directly affect methylation of its promoter region (-197/+359). Our results suggest that an imbalance in miR22-5p expression in the mid-luteal endometrium may be involved in minimal/mild endometriosis-associated infertility."
https://openalex.org/W3043022961,"Various motivational theories emphasize that desired emotional outcomes guide behavioral choices. Although motivational theory and research has emphasized that behavior is affected by desired emotional outcomes, little research has focused on the impact of anticipated feelings about engaging in behavior. The current research seeks to partly fill that void. Specifically, we borrow from affective forecasting research in suggesting that forecasts about engaging in performance-relevant behaviors can be more or less accurate. Furthermore, we suggest that the degree of accuracy has implications for self-reported task performance. To examine these ideas, we conducted two studies in which individuals made affective predictions about engaging in tasks and then later reported how they actually felt during task engagement. We also assessed their self-reported task performance. In Study 1, 214 workers provided affective forecasts about upcoming work tasks, and in Study 2, 185 students made forecasts about studying for an exam. Results based on polynomial regression were largely consistent across the studies. The accuracy of the forecasts did not conform to the pattern of affective forecasting accuracy typically found outside the performance domain. Furthermore, anticipated and experienced affect jointly predicted self-reported task performance in a consistent manner. Collectively, these findings suggest that taking into account anticipated affect, and its relationship with later experienced affect, provides a more comprehensive account of affect’s role in task performance."
https://openalex.org/W3041770047,"In a rat model, perinatal nicotine exposure results in an epigenetically driven multi- and trans-generationally transmitted asthmatic phenotype that tends to wane over successive generations. However, the effect of repeat nicotine exposure during the F1 (Filial 1) gestational period on the transmitted phenotype is unknown. Using a well-established rat model, we compared lung function, mesenchymal markers of airway reactivity, and global gonadal DNA methylation changes in F2 offspring in a sex-specific manner following perinatal exposure to nicotine in only the F0 gestation, in both F0 and F1 (F0/F1) gestations, and in neither (control group). Both F0 only and F0/F1 exposure groups showed an asthmatic phenotype, an effect that was more pronounced in the F0/F1 exposure group, especially in males. Testicular global DNA methylation increased, while ovarian global DNA methylation decreased in the F0/F1 exposed group. Since the offspring of smokers are more likely to smoke than the offspring of nonsmokers, this sets the stage for more severe asthma if both mother and grandmother had smoked during their pregnancies. Increased gonadal DNA methylation changes following nicotine reexposure in the F1 generation suggests that epigenetic mechanisms might well underlie the transgenerational inheritance of acquired phenotypic traits in general and nicotine-induced asthma in particular."
https://openalex.org/W3043063126,"Despite development of markers for identification of cancer stem cells, the mechanism underlying the survival and division of cancer stem cells in breast cancer remains unclear. Here we report that PKCλ expression was enriched in basal-like breast cancer, among breast cancer subtypes, and was correlated with ALDH1A3 expression (p = 0.016, χ2-test). Late stage breast cancer patients expressing PKCλhigh and ALDH1A3high had poorer disease-specific survival than those expressing PKCλlow and ALDH1A3low (p = 0.018, log rank test for Kaplan-Meier survival curves: hazard ratio 2.58, 95% CI 1.24–5.37, p = 0.011, multivariate Cox regression analysis). Functional inhibition of PKCλ through siRNA-mediated knockdown or CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout in ALDH1high MDA-MB 157 and MDA-MB 468 basal-like breast cancer cells led to increases in the numbers of trypan blue-positive and active-caspase 3-positive cells, as well as suppression of tumor-sphere formation and cell migration. Furthermore, the amount of CASP3 and PARP mRNA and the level of cleaved caspase-3 protein were enhanced in PKCλ-deficient ALDH1high cells. An Apoptosis inhibitor (z-VAD-FMK) suppressed the enhancement of cell death as well as the levels of cleaved caspase-3 protein in PKCλ deficient ALDH1high cells. It also altered the asymmetric/symmetric distribution ratio of ALDH1A3 protein. In addition, PKCλ knockdown led to increases in cellular ROS levels in ALDH1high cells. These results suggest that PKCλ is essential for cancer cell survival and migration, tumorigenesis, the asymmetric distribution of ALDH1A3 protein among cancer cells, and the maintenance of low ROS levels in ALDH1-positive breast cancer stem cells. This makes it a key contributor to the poorer prognosis seen in late-stage breast cancer patients."

Since NuRD complexes can incorporate the ATPase CHD3 as an alternative to CHD4, we questioned whether the CHD3 enzyme likewise modulates vascular development or integrity. We generated a floxed allele of Chd3 but saw no evidence of lethality or vascular anomalies when we deleted it in embryonic endothelial cells in vivo (Chd3ECKO). Furthermore, double-deletion of Chd3 and Chd4 in embryonic endothelial cells (Chd3/4ECKO) did not dramatically alter the timing and severity of embryonic phenotypes seen in Chd4ECKO mutants, indicating that CHD3 does not play a cooperative role with CHD4 in early vascular development. However, excision of Chd3 at the epiblast stage of development with a Sox2-Cre line allowed us to generate global heterozygous Chd3 mice (Chd3Δ/+), which were subsequently intercrossed and revealed partial lethality of Chd3Δ/Δ mutants prior to weaning. Tissues from surviving Chd3Δ/Δ mutants helped us confirm that CHD3 was efficiently deleted in these animals and that CHD3 is highly expressed in the gonads and brains of adult wildtype mice. Therefore, Chd3-flox mice will be beneficial for future studies about roles for this chromatin-remodeling enzyme in viable embryonic development and in gonadal and brain physiology."
https://openalex.org/W3040950827,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been highlighted as prominent genetic modulators involved in multiple important biological processes of cancer cells, especially in esophageal cancer (EC). We tried to elucidate the potential role of LINC00337 in the progression of EC. Based on TCGA database analysis and Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction determination, high expression of LINC00337 and FSCN1 was detected, while miR-145 exhibited a low expression in EC. LINC00337 was identified to bind to miR-145 to impair the miR-145-dependent FSCN1 inhibition. The underlying regulatory mechanisms were evaluated by transfection with LINC00337 overexpression plasmid, siRNA against LINC00337, miR-145 mimic, or anta-miR-145. Downregulation of LINC00337 results in increased Bax level, decreased FSCN1, Bcl-2, VEGF, and p53 levels, in addition to diminished cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumor growth, with accelerated cell apoptosis by upregulating miR-145. Taken together, the findings obtained provided evidence suggesting that LINC00337 acts as a tumor promoter in EC, providing insight and advancements for EC treatment."
https://openalex.org/W3041303343,"Ten cochlear implant (CI) users with single-sided deafness were asked to vary the parameters of an acoustic sound played to their contralateral ear to characterize the perception evoked by a pure tone played through the direct audio input of their CI. Two frequencies, centered on an apical and a medial electrode, were tested. In six subjects, the electrode positions were estimated on CT scans. The study was divided in 3 experiments in which the parameters of the acoustic sound varied. The listeners had to vary the frequency of a pure tone (Exp.1), the center frequency and the bandwidth of a filter applied to a harmonic complex sound (Exp.2), and the frequency of the components and the inharmonicity factor of a complex sound (Exp.3). Two testing sessions were performed at 3 and 12 months after activation. The mean results of Exp. 1 showed that the frequency of the matched tone was significantly lower for the apical than for the medial stimulus. In Exp.2, the mean center frequencies of the filters were also significantly lower for the apical than for the medial stimulus. As this parameter modifies the energy ratio between the high and low-frequency components, this result suggests that the medial stimulus was perceived with a brighter timbre than the apical stimulus. In Exp.3, the mean frequencies of the components were not significantly different between the sounds resulting from the stimulation of the two electrodes, but were significantly lower at the12-month session compared to the 3-month visit. These results suggest that a change in place of excitation may be perceived as a change in timbre rather than a change in pitch, and that an effect of adaptation can be observed."
https://openalex.org/W3041498707,"To investigate the relationship between food patterns and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Chinese elderly to provide evidence for risk prevention and control of MCI among elderly population.Between February 2017 to October 2018, a stratified multistage cluster sampling method was used to select participants from 760 communities of six districts in Xi'an, China, for 49-item food frequency questionnaire survey. A total of 2311 participants aged 60 to 88 years were included in the study with 444 (19.2%) participants of MCI among Chinese community-dwelling elderly adults. Food patterns associated with risk of dementia were assessed by using a reduced rank regression (RRR) analysis, and the multivariate linear regression was used to test trends of risk factors across scores for the food pattern.Four dietary patterns were extracted which explained 88.65% of the total variation in food intakes. Furthermore, the food pattern 1 (FP1) accounted for 60.25% of the total variation of all responsible variables and as a target dietary pattern in the study, which was related with high intake of legumes, vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy products, nuts and a low intake of noodles and cereals (p<0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that participants with a high score for FP1 had higher direction, memory and language function and FP1 can improve the ability of cognitive function (p<0.05).The FP1 of Chinese dietary patterns was significantly correlated with higher cognitive function which can reduce the risk of MCI among Chinese elderly."
https://openalex.org/W3042349255,"Healthcare waste management is the subject of a neglected issue in many developing countries. Health care facilities are facing a major challenge in handling healthcare wastes and reducing their potential risks to human health and the environment. Insufficient understanding of the risk associated with healthcare waste by health workforce can contribute to poor waste management practices. The main aim of this study is to assess risk perception towards healthcare waste among hospital attendants and to identify associated factors.We carried out a cross-sectional hospital-based study among 120 attendants of a private and public hospital in Kathmandu, Nepal. We used two-stage random sampling for the selection of hospital and participants. We conducted a face-to-face interview with the participants using semi-structured questionnaires. Based on the mean score, we classified risk perception as good and poor. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was carried out to determine associates of risk perception towards healthcare waste.Approximately 51.0% of hospital attendants had poor risk perception of healthcare waste. Nearly half of the participants (49.2%) had inadequate knowledge and 43.0% had a negative attitude. Factors such as healthcare waste management training (p = 0.028), housekeeping department (p = 0.036) and attitude (p = 0.001) were associated with risk perception of healthcare waste.Hospital attendants had a poor understanding of risk perception of healthcare waste. Periodic training on healthcare waste management and edification on the risk associated with healthcare waste is essential to boost awareness among all healthcare workers. Communication on behavioral improvements for appropriate waste management must be prioritized to change the perception of health workers."
https://openalex.org/W3041998667,"Endothelial rejection and a critical shortage of corneal transplants present an unmet medical need in corneal regeneration research area. Although basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent mitogenic factor for corneal ex vivo expansion, it is also a morphogen eliciting unfavorable endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EnMT) of corneal endothelial cells. A pharmacological reagent that retains the beneficial proliferative effect while lacking the EnMT effect of bFGF would be of great potential in corneal regeneration. In present study, we demonstrated that bFGF not only activated the canonical fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) tyrosine kinase pathway, but also further upregulated matrix metalloproteinase activity to cleave N-cadherin into N-terminus and C-terminus fragments, which activated the classical FGFR1 tyrosine kinase pathway and a cryptic β-catenin pathway to affect corneal proliferation and EnMT, respectively. We generated the synthetic peptides resembling a critical motif in the ectodomain of N-cadherin and found these peptides enhanced downstream proliferative signaling of FGFR1 but without seemingly EnMT effect. The potential of these peptides can be demonstrated on both ex vivo cell culture and in vivo rat cryo-injury model. Our study indicated this peptidomimetic approach of N-cadherin can stimulate corneal regeneration and offer a promising therapeutic option to treat corneal endothelial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W3042011607,"During oogenesis in the Drosophila ovary, numerous translational regulators promote the self-renewal or differentiation of stem cells. An intriguing question is how these regulators combine to execute translational regulation. Here, we study mechanisms for the posttranscriptional regulation of nos, a critical stem cell self-renewal factor in the Drosophila ovary; specifically, regulators that promote differentiation of the stem cell daughter. Previous studies showed that Bam, Bgcn, Mei-P26, and Sxl form a complex and repress nos expression through the nos 3'UTR. To further elucidate mechanistic processes of Nos translational regulation, we reconstituted nos repression in cultured Drosophila cells. We identify Ago1 and Brat as new members, and show that Ago1 acts through miRNA binding sites in the proximal region of the nos 3'UTR, whereas Sxl acts via an Sxl binding sequence in the distal region. Combining these findings with published reports, we propose that additional factors Bam, Bgcn, Mei-P26, and Brat are recruited to nos mRNAs through interaction with Ago1 and Sxl. These findings elucidate mechanisms of nos regulation by diverse translational repressors."
https://openalex.org/W3042908250,"Background Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) has been known to have a poor prognosis. Although evidence across adult RPGN cases has accumulated over many years, the number of case series in adolescents and young adults has been limited, requiring further studies. Methods A total of 1,766 cases from 1989 to 2007 were included in this nationwide questionnaire survey, led by Intractable (former name, Progressive) Renal Diseases Research, Research on intractable disease, from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan. To elucidate age-related differences in 2-year patient and renal survival rates, the cases were divided into the following four groups: children (0–18 years), young adults (19–39 years), the middle-aged (40–64 years), and the elderly (over 65 years). Results Of the 1,766 total RPGN cases, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated glomerulonephritis comprised 1,128 cases (63.9% of all RPGN cases), showing a tendency to increase with age. Two-year patient survival for RPGN was 93.9% among children, 92.6% in young adults, 83.2% in the middle-aged, and 68.8% in the elderly. The younger group (children plus young adults) showed a clearly higher survival rate compared to the older group (middle-aged plus elderly) (p<0.05). ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis also showed similar age-related results with all RPGN cases. The comparison of renal prognosis showed no statistically significant differences both in RPGN and in ANCA-associated GN. Conclusion The present study described the age-dependent characteristics of the classification of RPGN, especially focusing on a better prognosis of the younger group in patient survival both in RPGN and in ANCA-associated GN."
https://openalex.org/W3041676375,"Bacillus cereus commonly causes catheter-related bloodstream infections (BSIs) in hospital settings, and occasionally occurs fatal central nervous system (CNS) complications. B. cereus harboring Ba813, a specific chromosomal marker of Bacillus anthracis, has been found in patients with severe infection and nosocomial BSI. However, the bacteriological profile and clinical feature of Ba813 (+) B. cereus are unclear. Fifty-three patients with B. cereus BSI were examined. Isolates were evaluated for Ba813, B. anthracis-related and food poisoning-related virulence, multilocus sequencing typing, and biofilm formation. Patients’ clinical records were reviewed retrospectively. The 53 isolates were comprised of 29 different sequence types in two distinct clades. Seventeen of the 53 (32%) B. cereus isolates including five sequence types possessed Ba813 and were classified into Clade-1/Cereus-III lineage which is most closely related to Anthracis lineage. No B. cereus possessed B. anthracis-related virulence genes. Ba813 (+) strains showed a lower prevalence of enterotoxin genes than Clade-2 strains (n = 4), but no difference from Clade-1. Ba813 (+) strains showed significantly lower biofilm formation than Clade-1/non-Cereus-III (n = 22) and Clade-2 strains, respectively. Compared to Clade-1/non-Cereus-III and Clade-2 B. cereus, Ba813 (+) strains were isolated more frequently from elderly patients, patients with indwelling central venous catheter rather than peripheral venous catheter, and patients who remained in the hospital for longer before BSI onset. No significant differences in disease severity or mortality were observed. Though two of the ten Ba813 (-) strains in Clade-1/Cereus III were isolated from the patients with CNS complication, no significant difference was observed in the bacterial profile and clinical characteristics among Clade-1/Cereus III strains. In conclusion, our report suggested that Ba813-harboring B. cereus strains, genetically closely related to B. anthracis, were abundant among B. cereus strains in the hospital setting, and might cause catheter-related nosocomial BSI. However, it did not affect the clinical outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3041957709,"Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection, is a major public health concern with limited therapeutic options. Infection disturbs the homeostasis of host, resulting in excessive inflammation and immune suppression. This has prompted the clinical use of immunomodulators to balance host response as an alternative therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that Thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic immunomodulator pentapeptide (Arg-Lys-Asp-Val-Tyr) with an excellent safety profile in the clinic, protects mice against cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, as shown by improved survival rate, decreased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reduced ratios of macrophages and neutrophils in spleen and peritoneum. Regarding mechanism, TP5 changed the characteristics of LPS-stimulated macrophages by increasing the production of 15-deoxy-Δ12,14 -prostaglandin J2 (15-d-PGJ2). In addition, the improved effect of TP5 on survival rates was abolished by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) antagonist GW9662. Our results uncover the mechanism of the TP5 protective effects on CLP-induced sepsis and shed light on the development of TP5 as a therapeutic strategy for lethal systemic inflammatory disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3040924148,"Understanding locomotor activity patterns would reveal key information about an animal's foraging strategy, energy budget and evolutionary adaptation. We studied the locomotor activity patterns of the takin (Budorcas taxicolor) in a temperate mountain region in China using GPS radio-collar technology from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015. Our research showed that takin had a bimodal crepuscular locomotor activity pattern, with an especially obvious movement peak at dusk. The takins showed significant seasonal differences in their movement rates, with the lowest movement rate in winter. The animals also showed sexual differences in their movement rates. In spring, the female movement rate was significantly higher than that of males during daytime, while during nighttime the movement rate of males was higher than that of females. The male movement rate was significantly higher than that of females in summer. The movement rate of the takins were correlated to microenvironment temperature and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in each season. These findings suggest that takin could adjust locomotor activity levels adapt to reproductive requirements, temperature variation and forage variability."
