https://openalex.org/W2027974446,"The Valley of Oaxaca's large flat floor, high water table, low erosion rate, and frost-free floodplain give it a higher agricultural potential than that of most surrounding areas. The development of the pot-irrigation system early in the Formative period gave it a head start over other valleys, where the low water table did not permit such farming; Oaxaca maintained its advantage by assimilating canal irrigation, barbecho, infield-outfield systems, flood-water farming, and hillside terracing as these methods arose. With the expansion of population in the high-water-table zone of the high alluvium, competition for highly productive land and manipulation of surpluses may have led to initial disparities in wealth and status; competition probably increased when canal-irrigation systems were added during the Middle Formative, improving some localities to the point where one residential group owned land more valuable than that of its neighbors."

Reduction from the 3+ oxidation state was accomplished with Zn dust, Zn-Hg amalgam, Cr(2+), Eu(2+), and V(2+); additionally, measurements of the equilibrium with V(2+) provided an estimate of +0.2 volt for the couple, Md(2+) = Md(3+) + e(-). The chemical behavior of Md(3+) is similar to that of the other trivalent actinides and lanthanides. Oxidation from the trivalent to higher valence states with sodium bismuthate was not detected."

https://openalex.org/W1964415778,"The application of conventional electron microscopy to the study of plant leaves and fruit readily displays the surface wax deposits, but not the wax pathways from the underlying cells. A modified freeze-etch technique shows both at the same time and indicates that wax is transported from the epidermal cells to the leaf surface in microchannels."

https://openalex.org/W1988928588,"The concept of consolidation, or fixation, of memory is historically linked to the effects of disruptive agents on the brain and their interpretation. For example, retrograde amnesia seen in man following physical trauma has been interpreted to indicate that permanent memory normally forms following a learning experience. This idea was subsequently expanded by evidence for a temporal gradient of growing insusceptibility to disruption of newly-formed memory in both man and in experimental animals. Agents producing convulsions and unconsciousness, such as electroconvulsive shock, were reported to produce varying degrees of performance decrement as a function of the time of their administration. The question remained whether some unitary or multiple process of memory fixation existed or alternatively, whether the various disruptive agents had noxious properties that interfered with registration, storage or retrieval of behavioral information."

For since there appear not to be any ideas in the mind before the senses have conveyed any in, I conceive that ideas in the understanding are coeval with sensation. . . ."
