https://openalex.org/W1972489292,"Sequences coding for the bean seed protein phaseolin were inserted into transferred DNA regions of tumor-inducing plasmids. Constructions were devised in which the coding region of phaseolin was fused in the correct reading frame with the coding region of octopine synthase and placed under the transcriptional control of the octopine synthase promoter. Other plasmids were prepared to permit expression of the phaseolin-encoding sequences from the flanking phaseolin promoter region. The RNA transcribed in sunflower cells transformed with these constructions was characterized by hybridization procedures, SI nuclease mapping, and by translation in vitro of extracted RNA. These tests showed that the genomic intervening sequences were correctly excised. Immunoreactive phaseolin polypeptides were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by antibody hybridization to electrophoretically separated protein extracts of sunflower tissues isolated from crown gall tumors and of transformed sunflower cells grown in tissue culture. These results demonstrate the expression of a plant gene after transfer to a taxonomically distinct botanical family."

Satellites in electron diffraction patterns indicate that stacking of anions and cations is different from that in ideal dolomite. This example conforms to the model of basal defects proposed by Goldsmith and Graf in 1958 to explain nonstoichiometry in dolomite. This dolomite from the Nopah Range was formed by deep burial replacement of micritic limestone, and its peculiar superstructure is tentatively attributed to the late diagenetic conditions during replacement."

This article discusses the deposition and erosion of thin deposits (ten to hundreds of micrometers) of bright red dust associated with global dust storms, and the removal of centimeter amounts of material in selected areas during a dust storm late in the third winter. Atmospheric pressure data acquired during the period of intense erosion imply that baroclinic disturbances and strong diurnal solar tidal heating combined to produce strong winds. Erosion occurred principally in areas where soil cohesion was reduced by earlier surface sampler activities. Except for redistribution of thin layers of materials, the surface appears to be remarkably stable, perhaps because of cohesion of the undisturbed surface material."

This method has several advantages over ground-based methods of monitoring climatic change. Calculations indicate that, by monitoring the outgoing longwave flux for small intervals in the 15-micrometer spectral region, changes in stratospheric temperatures due to doubled atmospheric carbon dioxide are large enough to be detected above the various sources of noise. This method can be extended to other spectral regions so that causal links between changes in outgoing longwave radiation due to other trace gases and the thermal structure of the atmosphere could be established."

https://openalex.org/W1977758747,"A natural occurrence of predation upon toads (Scaphiopus multiplicatus) by fly larvae (Tabanus punctifer) is described. The larvae lie buried in mud, seize the toads with hooked mandibles, pull them partly into the mud, and kill them by feeding on their body fluids. The larvae may ordinarily subsist mostly on invertebrates and take Amphibia only opportunistically."
https://openalex.org/W2065975765,"A new technique has made it possible to measure the velocity of portions of the solar wind during its flow outward from the sun. This analysis utilizes spacecraft (ISEE-3) observations of radio emission generated in regions of the solar wind associated with solar active regions. By tracking the source of these radio waves over periods of days, it is possible to measure the motion of the emission regions. Evidence of solar wind acceleration during this outward flow, consistent with theoretical models, has also been obtained."

https://openalex.org/W2053395662,"A national research council committee report on the likely effects of increasing atmospheric CO/sub 2/ concentrations is reviewed. Anticipated CO/sub 2/ levels during the next century are likely to cause warming of the planet, the consequent changes in weather and sea level should be gradual enough that humanity should be able to accommodate. The councils basic conclusion are that no significant impacts will be felt for 20-30 years, and that interval of time should be used for intensive research on the subject."
