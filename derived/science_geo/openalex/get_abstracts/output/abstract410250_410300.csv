https://openalex.org/W2159743369,"Rising CO2 concentrations and water temperatures this century are likely to have transformative effects on many coastal marine organisms. Here, we compared the responses of two life history stages (larval, juvenile) of three species of calcifying bivalves (Mercenaria mercenaria, Crassostrea virginica, and Argopecten irradians) to temperatures (24 and 28°C) and CO2 concentrations (∼250, 390, and 750 ppm) representative of past, present, and future summer conditions in temperate estuaries. Results demonstrated that increases in temperature and CO2 each significantly depressed survival, development, growth, and lipid synthesis of M. mercenaria and A. irradians larvae and that the effects were additive. Juvenile M. mercenaria and A. irradians were negatively impacted by higher temperatures while C. virginica juveniles were not. C. virginica and A. irradians juveniles were negatively affected by higher CO2 concentrations, while M. mercenaria was not. Larvae were substantially more vulnerable to elevated CO2 than juvenile stages. These findings suggest that current and future increases in temperature and CO2 are likely to have negative consequences for coastal bivalve populations."
https://openalex.org/W2073260721,"We used a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer biosensor to screen for functional selective ligands of the human oxytocin (OT) receptor. We demonstrated that OT promoted the direct engagement and activation of G(q) and all the G(i/o) subtypes at the OT receptor. Other peptidic analogues, chosen because of specific substitutions in key OT structural/functional residues, all showed biased activation of G protein subtypes. No ligand, except OT, activated G(oA) or G(oB), and, with only one exception, all of the peptides that activated G(q) also activated G(i2) and G(i3) but not G(i1), G(oA), or G(oB), indicating a strong bias toward these subunits. Two peptides (DNalOVT and atosiban) activated only G(i1) or G(i3), failed to recruit β-arrestins, and did not induce receptor internalization, providing the first clear examples of ligands differentiating individual G(i/o) family members. Both analogs inhibited cell proliferation, showing that a single G(i) subtype-mediated pathway is sufficient to prompt this physiological response. These analogs represent unique tools for examining the contribution of G(i/o) members in complex biological responses and open the way to the development of drugs with peculiar selectivity profiles. This is of particular relevance because OT has been shown to improve symptoms in neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders characterized by abnormal social behaviors, such as autism. Functional selective ligands, activating a specific G protein signaling pathway, may possess a higher efficacy and specificity on OT-based therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2134709199,"The circadian clock allows plants to anticipate predictable daily changes in abiotic stimuli, such as light; however, whether the clock similarly allows plants to anticipate interactions with other organisms is unknown. Here we show that Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) has circadian clock-mediated variation in resistance to the virulent bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000), with plants being least susceptible to infection in the subjective morning. We suggest that the increased resistance to Pst DC3000 observed in the morning in Col-0 plants results from clock-mediated modulation of pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity. Analysis of publicly available microarray data revealed that a large number of Arabidopsis defence-related genes showed both diurnal- and circadian-regulation, including genes involved in the perception of the PAMP flagellin which exhibit a peak in expression in the morning. Accordingly, we observed that PAMP-triggered callose deposition was significantly higher in wild-type plants inoculated with Pst DC3000 hrpA in the subjective morning than in the evening, while no such temporal difference was evident in arrhythmic plants. Our results suggest that PAMP-triggered immune responses are modulated by the circadian clock and that temporal regulation allows plants to anticipate and respond more effectively to pathogen challenges in the daytime."
https://openalex.org/W2096621534,"Background MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is up-regulated in tumor tissue of patients with malignant diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Elevated concentrations of miR-21 have also been found in sera or plasma from patients with malignancies, rendering it an interesting candidate as serum/plasma marker for malignancies. Here we correlated serum miR-21 levels with clinical parameters in patients with different stages of chronic hepatitis C virus infection (CHC) and CHC-associated HCC. Methodology/Principal Findings 62 CHC patients, 29 patients with CHC and HCC and 19 healthy controls were prospectively enrolled. RNA was extracted from the sera and miR-21 as well as miR-16 levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR; miR-21 levels (normalized by miR-16) were correlated with standard liver parameters, histological grading and staging of CHC. The data show that serum levels of miR-21 were elevated in patients with CHC compared to healthy controls (P<0.001); there was no difference between serum miR-21 in patients with CHC and CHC-associated HCC. Serum miR-21 levels correlated with histological activity index (HAI) in the liver (r = −0.494, P = 0.00002), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (r = −0.309, P = 0.007), aspartate aminotransferase (r = −0.495, P = 0.000007), bilirubin (r = −0.362, P = 0.002), international normalized ratio (r = −0.338, P = 0.034) and γ-glutamyltransferase (r = −0.244, P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis revealed that ALT and miR-21 serum levels were independently associated with HAI. At a cut-off dCT of 1.96, miR-21 discriminated between minimal and mild-severe necroinflammation (AUC = 0.758) with a sensitivity of 53.3% and a specificity of 95.2%. Conclusions/Significance The serum miR-21 level is a marker for necroinflammatory activity, but does not differ between patients with HCV and HCV-induced HCC."
https://openalex.org/W1981042908,"Somatic mutations of DNMT3A gene have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We examined the entire coding sequences of DNMT3A gene by high-resolution melting analysis and sequencing in Chinese patients with myeloid malignancies. R882 mutations were found in 12/182 AML and in 4/51 MDS, but not in either 79 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), or 57 myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), or 4 chronic monomyelocytic leukemia. No other DNMT3A mutations were detected in all patients. R882 mutations were associated with old age and more frequently present in monoblastic leukemia (M4 and M5, 7/52) compared to other subtypes (5/130). Furthermore, 14/16 (86.6%) R882 mutations were observed in patients with normal karyotypes. The overall survival of mutated MDS patients was shorter than those without mutation (median 9 and 25 months, respectively). We conclude that DNMT3A R882 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in AML and MDS, and may be an adverse prognostic event in MDS."
https://openalex.org/W1967428712,"The role of the Th17 cell inhibiting cytokine IL-27 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease is contradictory. Its effects on the intestinal barrier have so far not been investigated, which was the aim of this study. We show that intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) express both IL-27 receptor subunits IL-27RA and gp130. The IL-27 receptor expression is up-regulated in intestinal inflammation and during bacterial infection. IL-27 activates ERK and p38 MAPKs as well as Akt, STAT1, STAT3, and STAT6 in IEC. IL-27 significantly enhances cell proliferation and IEC restitution. These functions of IL-27 are dependent on the activation of STAT3 and STAT6 signaling pathways. As analyzed by microarray, IL-27 modulates the expression of 428 target genes in IEC (316 up and 112 down; p < 0.05). IL-27 as well as its main target genes are up-regulated in colonic tissue and IEC isolated from mice with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. The IL-27-induced expression of the anti-bacterial gene deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1) is mediated by p38 and STAT3 signaling, whereas the activation of the anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial gene indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO1) is dependent on STAT1 signal transduction. IL-27-induced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase enzymatic activity leads to growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria by causing local tryptophan depletion.

https://openalex.org/W1992083261,"MUC16 (CA125) belongs to a family of high-molecular weight O-glycosylated proteins known as mucins. While MUC16 is well known as a biomarker in ovarian cancer, its expression pattern in pancreatic cancer (PC), the fourth leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States, remains unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of MUC16 during the initiation, progression and metastasis of PC for possible implication in PC diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. In this study, a microarray containing tissues from healthy and PC patients was used to investigate the differential protein expression of MUC16 in PC. MUC16 mRNA levels were also measured by RT-PCR in the normal human pancreatic, pancreatitis, and PC tissues. To investigate its expression pattern during PC metastasis, tissue samples from the primary pancreatic tumor and metastases (from the same patient) in the lymph nodes, liver, lung and omentum from Stage IV PC patients were analyzed. To determine its association in the initiation of PC, tissues from PC patients containing pre-neoplastic lesions of varying grades were stained for MUC16. Finally, MUC16 expression was analyzed in 18 human PC cell lines. MUC16 is not expressed in the normal pancreatic ducts and is strongly upregulated in PC and detected in pancreatitis tissue. It is first detected in the high-grade pre-neoplastic lesions preceding invasive adenocarcinoma, suggesting that its upregulation is a late event during the initiation of this disease. MUC16 expression appears to be stronger in metastatic lesions when compared to the primary tumor, suggesting a role in PC metastasis. We have also identified PC cell lines that express MUC16, which can be used in future studies to elucidate its functional role in PC. Altogether, our results reveal that MUC16 expression is significantly increased in PC and could play a potential role in the progression of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2167319787,"Introduction Diabetes is a worldwide high prevalence chronic progressive disease that poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems. The aim of this study is to provide a detailed economic burden of diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its complications in Iran in 2009 year. Methods This is a prevalence-based cost-of-illness study focusing on quantifying direct health care costs by bottom-up approach. Data on inpatient hospital services, outpatient clinic visits, physician services, drugs, laboratory test, education and non-medical cost were collected from two national registries. The human capital approach was used to calculate indirect costs separately in male and female and also among different age groups. Results The total national cost of diagnosed T2DM in 2009 is estimated at 3.78 billion USA dollars (USD) including 2.04±0.28 billion direct (medical and non-medical) costs and indirect costs of 1.73 million. Average direct and indirect cost per capita was 842.6±102 and 864.8 USD respectively. Complications (48.9%) and drugs (23.8%) were main components of direct cost. The largest components of medical expenditures attributed to diabetes's complications are cardiovascular disease (42.3% of total Complications cost), nephropathy (23%) and ophthalmic complications (14%). Indirect costs include temporarily disability (335.7 million), permanent disability (452.4 million) and reduced productivity due to premature mortality (950.3 million). Conclusions T2DM is a costly disease in the Iran healthcare system and consume more than 8.69% of total health expenditure. In addition to these quantified costs, T2DM imposes high intangible costs on society in terms of reduced quality of life. Identification of effective new strategies for the control of diabetes and its complications is a public health priority."
https://openalex.org/W2016517200,"Intrinsic drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis limits therapeutic options for treating tuberculosis. The mycobacterial transcriptional regulator whiB7 contributes to intrinsic resistance by activating its own expression and many drug resistance genes in response to antibiotics. To investigate whiB7 activation, we constructed a GFP reporter to monitor its expression, and we used it to investigate the whiB7 promoter and to screen our custom library of almost 600 bioactive compounds, including the majority of clinical antibiotics. Results showed whiB7 was transcribed from a promoter that was conserved across mycobacteria and other actinomycetes, including an AT-rich sequence that was likely targeted by WhiB7. Expression was induced by compounds having diverse structures and targets, independent of the ability of whiB7 to mediate resistance, and was dependent on media composition. Pretreatment with whiB7 activators resulted in clinically relevant increases in intrinsic drug resistance. Antibiotic-induced transcription was synergistically increased by the reductant dithiothreitol, an effect mirrored by a whiB7-dependent shift to a highly reduced cytoplasm reflected by the ratio of reduced/oxidized mycothiol. These data provided evidence that intrinsic resistance resulting from whiB7 activation is linked to fundamental changes in cell metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2010156941,"This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms that coordinate lymphangiogenesis. Using mouse models of lymphatic regeneration and inflammatory lymphangiogenesis, we explored the hypothesis that hypoxia inducible factor-α (HIF-1α) is a central regulator of lymphangiogenesis. We show that HIF-1α inhibition by small molecule inhibitors (YC-1 and 2-methyoxyestradiol) results in delayed lymphatic repair, decreased local vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C) expression, reduced numbers of VEGF-C(+) cells, and reductions in inflammatory lymphangiogenesis. Using transgenic HIF-1α/luciferase mice to image HIF-1α expression in real time in addition to Western blot analysis and pimonidazole staining for cellular hypoxia, we demonstrate that hypoxia stabilizes HIF-1α during initial stages of wound repair (1-2 wk); whereas inflammation secondary to gradients of lymphatic fluid stasis stabilizes HIF-1α thereafter (3-6 wk). In addition, we show that CD4(+) cell-mediated inflammation is necessary for this response and regulates HIF-1α expression by macrophages, as CD4-deficient or CD4-depleted mice demonstrate 2-fold reductions in HIF-1α expression as compared to wild-types. In summary, we show that HIF-1α is a critical coordinator of lymphangiogenesis by regulating the expression of lymphangiogenic cytokines as part of an early response mechanism to hypoxia, inflammation, and lymphatic fluid stasis."
https://openalex.org/W2089911941,"Photolyases and cryptochromes are evolutionarily related flavoproteins with distinct functions. While photolyases can repair UV-induced DNA lesions in a light-dependent manner, cryptochromes regulate growth, development and the circadian clock in plants and animals. Here we report about two photolyase-related proteins, named PhrA and PhrB, found in the phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. PhrA belongs to the class III cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photolyases, the sister class of plant cryptochromes, while PhrB belongs to a new class represented in at least 350 bacterial organisms. Both proteins contain flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) as a primary catalytic cofactor, which is photoreduceable by blue light. Spectral analysis of PhrA confirmed the presence of 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) as antenna cofactor. PhrB comprises also an additional chromophore, absorbing in the short wavelength region but its spectrum is distinct from known antenna cofactors in other photolyases. Homology modeling suggests that PhrB contains an Fe-S cluster as cofactor which was confirmed by elemental analysis and EPR spectroscopy. According to protein sequence alignments the classical tryptophan photoreduction pathway is present in PhrA but absent in PhrB. Although PhrB is clearly distinguished from other photolyases including PhrA it is, like PhrA, required for in vivo photoreactivation. Moreover, PhrA can repair UV-induced DNA lesions in vitro. Thus, A. tumefaciens contains two photolyase homologs of which PhrB represents the first member of the cryptochrome/photolyase family (CPF) that contains an iron-sulfur cluster."
https://openalex.org/W2017477406,"It has been known for many years that Trichinella spiralis initiates infection by penetrating the columnar epithelium of the small intestine; however, the mechanisms used by the parasite in the establishment of its intramulticellular niche in the intestine are unknown. Although the previous observations indicated that invasion also occurs in vitro when the infective larvae are inoculated onto cultures of intestinal epithelial cells (e.g., human colonic carcinoma cell line Caco-2, HCT-8), a normal readily manipulated in vitro model has not been established because of difficulties in the culture of primary intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In this study, we described a normal intestinal epithelial model in which T. spiralis infective larvae were shown to invade the monolayers of normal mouse IECs in vitro. The IECs derived from intestinal crypts of fetal mouse small intestine had the ability to proliferate continuously and express specific cytokeratins as well as intestinal functional cell markers. Furthermore, they were susceptible to invasion by T. spiralis. When inoculated onto the IEC monolayer, infective larvae penetrated cells and migrated through them, leaving trails of damaged cells heavily loaded with T. spiralis larval excretory-secretory (ES) antigens which were recognized by rabbit immune sera on immunofluorescence test. The normal intestinal epithelial model of invasion mimicking the natural environment in vivo will help us to further investigate the process as well as the mechanisms by which T. spiralis establishes its intestinal niche."
https://openalex.org/W1995856721,"The transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) plays a central role in regulating inflammation in response to several external signals. The TGFβ-associated kinase 1 (TAK1) is an upstream regulator of NF-κB signaling. In TGFβ-stimulated cells, TAK1 undergoes Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination at Lys-34 by TNF receptor-associated factor 6 and is thereby activated. The aim of this study was to investigate whether TAK1 polyubiquitination at Lys-34 is also essential for NF-κB activation via TNF receptor, IL-1 receptor and toll-like receptor 4. We observed that TAK1 polyubiquitination occurred at Lys-34 and required the E3 ubiquitin ligase TNF receptor-associated factor 6 after stimulation of cells with IL-1β. Polyubiquitination of TAK1 also occurred at Lys-34 in cells stimulated by TNF-α and LPS, which activates TLR4, as well as in HepG2 and prostate cancer cells stimulated with TGFβ, which in all cases resulted in NF-κB activation. Expression of a K34R-mutant TAK1 led to a reduced NF-κB activation, IL-6 promoter activity, and proinflammatory cytokine secretion by TNF-α-stimulated PC-3U cells. Similar results were obtained in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 after LPS treatment. In conclusion, polyubiquitination of TAK1 is correlated with activation of TAK1 and is essential for activation of NF-κB signaling downstream of several receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2021687308,"We investigated auditory perception and cognitive processing in individuals with chronic tinnitus or hearing loss using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our participants belonged to one of three groups: bilateral hearing loss and tinnitus (TIN), bilateral hearing loss without tinnitus (HL), and normal hearing without tinnitus (NH). We employed pure tones and frequency-modulated sweeps as stimuli in two tasks: passive listening and active discrimination. All subjects had normal hearing through 2 kHz and all stimuli were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz so that all participants could hear them equally well. Performance was similar among all three groups for the discrimination task. In all participants, a distributed set of brain regions including the primary and non-primary auditory cortices showed greater response for both tasks compared to rest. Comparing the groups directly, we found decreased activation in the parietal and frontal lobes in the participants with tinnitus compared to the HL group and decreased response in the frontal lobes relative to the NH group. Additionally, the HL subjects exhibited increased response in the anterior cingulate relative to the NH group. Our results suggest that a differential engagement of a putative auditory attention and short-term memory network, comprising regions in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortices and the anterior cingulate, may represent a key difference in the neural bases of chronic tinnitus accompanied by hearing loss relative to hearing loss alone."

The L-type CaV1.4 channel displays distinct properties such as absence of calcium-dependent inactivation (CDI) and slow voltage-dependent inactivation (VDI) due to the presence of an autoinhibitory domain (inhibitor of CDI) in the distal C terminus. We hypothesized that native CaV1.4 is subjected to extensive alternative splicing, much like the other voltage-gated calcium channels, and employed the transcript scanning method to identify alternatively spliced exons within the CaV1.4 transcripts isolated from the human retina. In total, we identified 19 alternative splice variations, of which 16 variations have not been previously reported. Characterization of the C terminus alternatively spliced exons using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology revealed a splice variant that exhibits robust CDI. This splice variant arose from the splicing of a novel alternate exon (43*) that can be found in 13.6% of the full-length transcripts screened. Inclusion of exon 43* inserts a stop codon that truncates half the C terminus. The CaV1.4 43* channel exhibited robust CDI, a larger current density, a hyperpolarized shift in activation potential by ∼10 mV, and a slower VDI. Through deletional experiments, we showed that the inhibitor of CDI was responsible for modulating channel activation and VDI, in addition to CDI. Calcium currents in the photoreceptors were observed to exhibit CDI and are more negatively activated as compared with currents elicited from heterologously expressed full-length CaV1.4.

https://openalex.org/W2114705693,"Plumbagin (PL), a herbal compound derived from roots of the medicinal plant Plumbago zeylanica, has been shown to have immunosuppressive properties. Present report describes that PL is a potent novel agent in control of encephalitogenic T cell responses and amelioration of mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), through down-regulation of JAK-STAT pathway. PL was found to selectively inhibit IFN-γ and IL-17 production by CD4(+) T cells, which was mediated through abrogated phosphorylation of JAK1 and JAK2. Consistent with IFN-γ and IL-17 reduction was suppressed STAT1/STAT4/T-bet pathway which is critical for Th1 differentiation, as well as STAT3/ROR pathway which is essential for Th17 differentiation. In addition, PL suppressed pro-inflammatory molecules such as iNOS, IFN-γ and IL-6, accompanied by inhibition of IκB degradation as well as NF-κB phosphorylation. These data give new insight into the novel immune regulatory mechanism of PL and highlight the great value of this kind of herb compounds in probing the complex cytokine signaling network and novel therapeutic targets for autoimmune diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2043244700,"To establish optimal cutoff values for serologic diagnosis of fundic atrophy in a high-risk area for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cancer with high prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in Northern Iran, we performed an endoscopy-room-based validation study.We measured serum pepsinogens I (PGI) and II (PGII), gastrin 17 (G-17), and antibodies against whole H. pylori, or cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA) antigen among 309 consecutive patients in two major endoscopy clinics in northeastern Iran. Updated Sydney System was used as histology gold standard. Areas under curves (AUCs), optimal cutoff and predictive values were calculated for serum biomarkers against the histology.309 persons were recruited (mean age: 63.5 years old, 59.5% female). 84.5% were H. pylori positive and 77.5% were CagA positive. 21 fundic atrophy and 101 nonatrophic pangastritis were diagnosed. The best cutoff values in fundic atrophy assessment were calculated at PGI<56 µg/l (sensitivity: 61.9%, specificity: 94.8%) and PGI/PGII ratio<5 (sensitivity: 75.0%, specificity: 91.0%). A serum G-17<2.6 pmol/l or G-17>40 pmol/l was 81% sensitive and 73.3% specific for diagnosing fundic atrophy. At cutoff concentration of 11.8 µg/l, PGII showed 84.2% sensitivity and 45.4% specificity to distinguish nonatrophic pangastritis. Exclusion of nonatrophic pangastritis enhanced diagnostic ability of PGI/PGII ratio (from AUC = 0.66 to 0.90) but did not affect AUC of PGI. After restricting study samples to those with PGII<11.8, the sensitivity of using PGI<56 to define fundic atrophy increased to 83.3% (95%CI 51.6-97.9) and its specificity decreased to 88.8% (95%CI 80.8-94.3).Among endoscopy clinic patients, PGII is a sensitive marker for extension of nonatrophic gastritis toward the corpus. PGI is a stable biomarker in assessment of fundic atrophy and has similar accuracy to PGI/PGII ratio among populations with prevalent nonatrophic pangastritis."
https://openalex.org/W2074130009,"In the elderly in Scandinavia, multi-dose drug dispensing (MDD) is a common alternative to ordinary prescriptions (OP). MDD patients receive their drugs in unit bags, one for each dose occasion. The prescribing procedure differs between MDD and OP. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between MDD and quality of drug treatment (QDT).A cross-sectional study was performed of all inhabitants in Region Västra Götaland alive on December 31st 2007, aged ≥65 years, with ≥1 prescribed drug and ≥2 health care visits for ≥2 diagnoses for obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and/or cardiovascular disease in 2005-2007 (n = 24,146). For each patient, drug treatment on December 31st 2007 was estimated from drugs registered in the Swedish Prescribed Drug Register. QDT was evaluated according to established quality indicators (≥10 drugs, Long-acting benzodiazepines, Drugs with anticholinergic action, ≥3 psychotropics, and Drugs combinations that should be avoided). Logistic regression, with adjustments for age, sex, burden of disease, and residence, was performed to investigate the association between MDD and QDT. Mean age was 77 years, 51% were females, and 20% used MDD. For all quality indicators, the proportion of patients with poor QDT was greater in patients with MDD than in patients with OP (all P<0.0001). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for poor QDT (MDD patients vs. OP patients) ranged from 1.47 (1.30-1.65) to 7.08 (6.30-7.96) and from 1.36 (1.18-1.57) to 5.48 (4.76-6.30), respectively.Patients with MDD have poorer QDT than patients with OP. This cannot be explained by differences in age, sex, burden of disease, or residence. These findings must be taken into account when designing alternative prescribing systems. Further research is needed to evaluate causative factors and if the findings also apply to other dose dispensing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2017667367,"Macroalgal assemblages are some of the most productive systems on earth and they contribute significantly to nearshore ecosystems. Globally, macroalgal assemblages are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic activities such as sedimentation, eutrophication and climate change. Despite this, very little research has considered the potential effects of canopy loss on primary productivity, although the literature is rich with evidence showing the ecological effects of canopy disturbance. In this study we used experimental removal plots of habitat-dominating algae (Order Fucales) that had been initiated several years previously to construct a chronosequence of disturbed macroalgal communities and to test if there were legacy effects of canopy loss on primary productivity. We used in situ photo-respirometry to test the primary productivity of algal assemblages in control and removal plots at two intertidal elevations. In the mid tidal zone assemblage, the removal plots at two sites had average primary productivity values of only 40% and 60% that of control areas after 90 months. Differences in productivity were associated with lower biomass and density of the fucoid algal canopy and lower taxa richness in the removal plots after 90 months. Low-shore plots, established three years earlier, showed that the loss of the large, dominant fucoid resulted in at least 50% less primary productivity of the algal assemblage than controls, which lasted for 90 months; other smaller fucoid species had recruited but they were far less productive. The long term reduction in primary productivity following a single episode of canopy loss of a dominant species in two tidal zones suggests that these assemblages are not very resilient to large perturbations. Decreased production output may have severe and long-lasting consequences on the surrounding communities and has the potential to alter nutrient cycling in the wider nearshore environment."

IntroductionThe Maillard reaction (non-enzymatic reactions of reducing sugars with amines) in vivo is associated with long term complications of diabetes, uremia, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease as well as with pathophysiologies linked to aging in general. The stable products of this reaction are referred to as advanced glycation end products (AGEs). 2The abbreviations used are: AGEadvanced glycation end productCMLN6-carboxymethyl lysine1-DG1-deoxy-d-erythro-hexo-2,3-diulose (1-deoxyglucosone)3-DG3-deoxy-d-erythro-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxyglucosone)HD patientspatients undergoing hemodialysisAmadori product1-deoxy-1-(N6-lysino)-d-fructoseglucosoned-arabino-hexos-2-uloseCELN6-carboxyethyl lysineBocbutoxycarbonylDPdeclustering potentialCEcollision energyCXPcollision cell exit potentialLODlimit of detectionLOQlimit of quantification. Numerous studies have documented the accumulation of AGEs in tissue proteins but also in the circulation of patients with renal failure, irrespective of the presence of diabetes (1Dawnay A.

Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). In general, AGEs can accumulate as protein modifications or as AGE-free adducts (4Agalou S. Ahmed N. Thornalley P.J. Dawnay A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1043: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These free adducts are formed by cellular proteolysis of glycated proteins, direct glycation of amino acids, and digestion of glycated proteins in food. They have high renal clearance and are the major form in which AGEs are excreted from the body in urine and in dialysate in renal replacement therapy (5Thornalley P.J. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2005; 20: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).We reported on two groups of Maillard amide-AGEs. A first set N6-{2-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}lysine and N6-glycoloyl lysine have been established for the reaction of glyoxal with lysine via rearrangement reactions in vitro and in vivo. The formation pathways are directly linked to N6-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) via glyoxalimine structures (6Glomb M.A. Pfahler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41638-41647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). More recently, we identified a second class of lysine amide modifications N6-acetyl lysine, N6-formyl lysine, N6-lactoyl lysine, and N6-glycerinyl lysine in vitro based on β-dicarbonyl fragmentation of native and oxidized reductone structures. Incubation experiments confirmed the α-dicarbonyl compound 1-deoxy-d-erythro-hexo-2,3-diulose (1-deoxyglucosone, 1-DG) as a direct precursor (7Smuda M. Voigt M. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 6458-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The essential role of α-dicarbonyls as central intermediates of high reactivity in the complex Maillard chemistry in vitro and in vivo has been manifested over the years. The α-dicarbonyl compounds glyoxal, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxy-d-erythro-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxyglucosone, 3-DG) were already detected in human plasma (8McLellan A.C. Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J.

Electrophoresis. 2007; 28: 3940-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even at the low concentrations found in physiological systems, α-dicarbonyls retain potent glycating activity (12Lo T.W. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).Acylation of amino acids in vivo within the polypeptide chain was first detected in cell nuclei as a rapid and reversible incorporation of radioactive labeled acetate into histones H3 and H4 (13Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). This posttranslational acetylation neutralizes the positive charge of the amino acid, changing protein function in diverse ways (14Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 15Yang X.J. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1076-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The modification of core histone tails by histone acetyltransferases or histone deacetylases plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression (16Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 17Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Despite great biochemical and clinical interest in lysine acetylation, the knowledge of in vivo acetylation sites is limited and subject to current research (18Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F.

Tsutsui et al. (20Tsutsui H. Maeda T. Toyo'oka T. Min J.Z. Inagaki S. Higashi T. Kagawa Y. J. Proteome.

The lysine adduct was discussed as one of several potential biomarker candidates related to diabetes mellitus.N6-formyl lysine is formed in vitro by reaction of albumin with trichloroethylene oxide, a major metabolite of 1,1,2-trichloroethylene, one of the most common compounds found in chemical waste dumps (21Cai H. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, it could be identified in incubation mixtures of various sugars, l-ascorbic acid or l-dehydroascorbic acid with poly-l-lysine and β-lactoglobulin, respectively (22Hasenkopf K. Rönner B. Hiller H. Pischetsrieder M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 5697-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Jiang et al. (23Jiang T. Zhou X. Taghizadeh K. Dong M. Dedon P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) observed transfer of formyl groups from 3′-formylphosphate-ended DNA, arising from oxidation of the 5′-position of deoxyribose and subsequent DNA strand breakage by the enediyne antibiotic neocarzinostatin, to histone proteins in human TK6 cells to give N6-formyl lysine.The aim of the present work was to elucidate formation and relevance of the four amide-AGEs N6-acetyl lysine, N6-formyl lysine, N6-lactoyl lysine, and N6-glycerinyl lysine (structures are shown in Fig. 5) in vivo with regard to non-enzymatic mechanisms within the Maillard reaction. Therefore, the free adducts were analyzed in human blood plasma by means of an LC-MS/MS technique. In model experiments, formation from glucose, the physiological most important sugar, and from various α-dicarbonyl structures as direct precursors was confirmed. Comparison of in vivo with in vitro results allowed us to assess the impact of Maillard chemistry on amide-AGE formation in vivo.DISCUSSIONPerforming several model incubations, we tried to gain insights into possible formation pathways linked to Maillard chemistry in vivo. N6-{2-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}lysine and N6-glycoloyl lysine are formed via rearrangement reactions of glyoxal with lysine in contrast to the novel amide-AGEs involving β-dicarbonyl fragmentations (Fig. 4). We already investigated the degradation of the α-dicarbonyl 1-DG in the presence of N1-t-Boc-lysine, identifying 1-DG as a direct precursor of the amide-AGEs (7Smuda M. Voigt M. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 6458-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Now, glucosone was found to be another potential precursor of formyl lysine, while degradation of 3-DG did not result in any acylation. This is expected because 3-DG in contrast to 1-DG and glucosone cannot be converted to an α-oxoenediol, which is a prerequisite for β-dicarbonyl fragmentations. As shown in Fig. 5, all three C6-dicarbonyl structures are known Maillard degradation products of glucose. Although 1-DG and 3-DG are generated non-oxidatively via enolization and dehydration from the Amadori product, glucosone is formed via autoxidation of glucose or oxidation of the Amadori product or the intermediate Schiff base (31Gobert J. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009; 57: 8591-8597Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).FIGURE 4Mechanism of amide-AGE formation via rearrangement (a) and β-dicarbonyl cleavage (b).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The results of incubations of glucose with N1-t-Boc-lysine and of the Amadori product of both revealed a very similar formation pattern for acetyl lysine and lactoyl lysine in reaction mixtures with glucose and 1-DG, respectively (Table 4 and Fig. 3), confirming 1-DG as the direct precursor independent from oxidative processes via hydrolytic β-dicarbonyl fragmentation. Although the formation of formyl lysine from 1-DG responded to oxidative conditions, the difference was far more pronounced from glucose or the Amadori product. This pointed to the existence of another precursor emerging from oxidative pathways, which was identified as glucosone. Here, formyl lysine was detected in significant amounts, whereas formation of all other target amides was negligible. These findings were further supported by the same ratio of acetyl to formyl lysine in 1-DG versus glucose incubations under deaerated conditions, i.e. glucosone contributes only under oxidative conditions to formation of formyl lysine from glucose, whereas 1-DG is the sole precursor in absence of oxygen. As formyl lysine, glycerinyl lysine showed a significant discrepancy in glucose versus 1-DG incubations induced by aeration. From the present results the additional reaction pathway leading to glycerinyl lysine from glucose remained unclear as none of the other Maillard intermediates responded. However, it is obvious that oxidation is required and that glucosone is not a relevant precursor.Comparing the results of in vivo samples with above model experiments, incubations under aerated conditions should simulate the situation in uremia. Uremia has been described as a state of inflammatory stress resulting from either increased oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids (oxidative stress) or inadequate detoxification or inactivation of reactive carbonyl compounds derived from both carbohydrates and lipids by oxidative and non-oxidative chemistry (carbonyl stress) (3Miyata T. van Ypersele de Strihou C. Kurokawa K. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Including only non-diabetic subjects in the present study, the impact of differences in glucose plasma concentrations was avoided.The comparison gave a very diverse picture. Although all target amides in vivo were significantly increased in uremia (Fig. 1), only formyl and glycerinyl lysine responded to aeration in the glucose-lysine model. In addition, the ratio of concentrations between the single amides was completely different. In vivo, acetyl, formyl, and lactoyl lysine were within the same range, with glycerinyl lysine showing 10-fold lower concentrations. In contrast, glucose incubations showed the smallest concentrations for lactoyl lysine. Given that glycerinyl lysine indeed follows the patterns of the model incubations, this suggests additional pathways for the formation of acetyl, formyl, and lactoyl lysine. An alternative mechanism leading to lactoyl lysine in vivo is the reaction of methylglyoxal with ϵ-amino lysine residues corresponding to our identification of N6-glycoloyl lysine in glyoxal lysine model incubations based on rearrangement reactions. Indeed, when we incubated methylglyoxal with N1-t-Boc-lysine, we found significant amounts of lactoyl lysine independent from the presence of oxygen (Table 4). In vivo, this also explains the 7-fold increase in uremia, as we measured a 4-fold increase in methylglyoxal in such subjects (138 ± 39 versus 496 ± 132 pmol/ml plasma). Concentrations of acetyl lysine were highest in vivo and responded to renal failure by a 2-fold increase. This might be explained by increased cell death triggered by the strong inflammatory processes observed under uremia resulting in accelerated release of acetyl lysine from acetylated histone proteins. In addition, the increased concentration of methylglyoxal in presence of peroxynitrite might also contribute to the acetylation of ϵ-amino lysine residues in vivo. Massari et al. (32Massari J. Tokikawa R. Zanolli L. Tavares M.F. Assunção N.A. Bechara E.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2010; 23: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) described a mechanism of l-lysine acetylation by a methylglyoxal-peroxynitrite system in vitro. Although the direct reaction of methylglyoxal with proteins probably dominates over that with peroxynitrite, the post-translational acetylation of proteins by radical mechanisms in the presence of methylglyoxal might be a plausible second non-enzymatic pathway to acetyltransferase-catalyzed reactions. Moreover, although much less reactive, H2O2 could replace peroxynitrite in the acetyl-generating reaction from methylglyoxal. The idea to explain the 2-fold increase of formyl lysine in uremia based on the in vitro models is undermined by the fact that neither 1-DG nor glucosone have been detected in vivo so far. An intriguing alternative mechanism might be the with inflammation increased oxidative DNA breakdown to give 3′-formylphosphate-ended DNA fragments as a potential precursor, but again, such species have not been identified in vivo (23Jiang T. Zhou X. Taghizadeh K. Dong M. Dedon P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).As a first attempt to assess the importance of the novel amide-AGEs as clinical markers for kidney failure, plasma levels of the well established lysine modifications CML and CEL were measured additionally. In healthy human subjects, concentrations were within the same range. The AGE levels decreased in the following order: acetyl lysine > CEL ≈ formyl lysine ≈ CML > lactoyl lysine > glycerinyl lysine. In uremia, we observed a 13- to 16-fold increase of CEL and CML. Amide-AGEs showed only a 2- to 8-fold increase. Thus, amide-AGEs might be of major importance when compared with other AGE structures identified in vivo so far, even though the impact of uremia on plasma concentrations of CML and CEL is more pronounced.In conclusion, we previously proposed a formation mechanism for the novel amide-AGEs acetyl, formyl, lactoyl, and glycerinyl lysine via degradation of 1-DG in the presence of lysine (7Smuda M. Voigt M. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 6458-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Now, glucosone and methylglyoxal were identified as alternative precursors for formyl and lactoyl lysine, respectively. All four amide-AGEs were unequivocally detected in human plasma, formyl, lactoyl, and glycerinyl lysine for the first time. The results strongly suggest a major participation of non-enzymatic Maillard mechanisms on amide-AGE formation pathways in vivo paralleled by enzymatic processes. The pathophysiologic consequences of two to 7-fold increased levels of amide-AGE free adducts in plasma of HD patients is not yet understood and requires further investigation. Also, the question which quantities of AGE-free adducts are derived from the breakdown of AGE-modified proteins or from direct synthesis remains unclear. However, absolute plasma concentration levels were in the same range similar to other established lysine modifications, i.e. CML and CEL, and suggest a comparable impact of non-enzymatic biochemistry on pathophysiologies in the human organism.

Thornalley P.J. Dawnay A. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2005; 1043: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These free adducts are formed by cellular proteolysis of glycated proteins, direct glycation of amino acids, and digestion of glycated proteins in food. They have high renal clearance and are the major form in which AGEs are excreted from the body in urine and in dialysate in renal replacement therapy (5Thornalley P.J. Pediatr. Nephrol. 2005; 20: 1515-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). advanced glycation end product N6-carboxymethyl lysine 1-deoxy-d-erythro-hexo-2,3-diulose (1-deoxyglucosone) 3-deoxy-d-erythro-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxyglucosone) patients undergoing hemodialysis 1-deoxy-1-(N6-lysino)-d-fructose d-arabino-hexos-2-ulose N6-carboxyethyl lysine butoxycarbonyl declustering potential collision energy collision cell exit potential limit of detection limit of quantification. We reported on two groups of Maillard amide-AGEs. A first set N6-{2-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}lysine and N6-glycoloyl lysine have been established for the reaction of glyoxal with lysine via rearrangement reactions in vitro and in vivo. The formation pathways are directly linked to N6-carboxymethyl lysine (CML) via glyoxalimine structures (6Glomb M.A. Pfahler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41638-41647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). More recently, we identified a second class of lysine amide modifications N6-acetyl lysine, N6-formyl lysine, N6-lactoyl lysine, and N6-glycerinyl lysine in vitro based on β-dicarbonyl fragmentation of native and oxidized reductone structures. Incubation experiments confirmed the α-dicarbonyl compound 1-deoxy-d-erythro-hexo-2,3-diulose (1-deoxyglucosone, 1-DG) as a direct precursor (7Smuda M. Voigt M. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 6458-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The essential role of α-dicarbonyls as central intermediates of high reactivity in the complex Maillard chemistry in vitro and in vivo has been manifested over the years. The α-dicarbonyl compounds glyoxal, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxy-d-erythro-hexos-2-ulose (3-deoxyglucosone, 3-DG) were already detected in human plasma (8McLellan A.C. Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J.

Electrophoresis. 2007; 28: 3940-3947Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even at the low concentrations found in physiological systems, α-dicarbonyls retain potent glycating activity (12Lo T.W. Selwood T. Thornalley P.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1994; 48: 1865-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Acylation of amino acids in vivo within the polypeptide chain was first detected in cell nuclei as a rapid and reversible incorporation of radioactive labeled acetate into histones H3 and H4 (13Allfrey V.G. Faulkner R. Mirsky A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1964; 51: 786-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). This posttranslational acetylation neutralizes the positive charge of the amino acid, changing protein function in diverse ways (14Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 15Yang X.J. Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1076-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The modification of core histone tails by histone acetyltransferases or histone deacetylases plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression (16Lee K.K. Workman J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar, 17Shahbazian M.D. Grunstein M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1184) Google Scholar). Despite great biochemical and clinical interest in lysine acetylation, the knowledge of in vivo acetylation sites is limited and subject to current research (18Choudhary C. Kumar C. Gnad F. Nielsen M.L. Rehman M. Walther T.C. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Science. 2009; 325: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Piraud et al. (19Piraud M. Vianey-Saban C. Petritis K. Elfakir C.

Tsutsui et al. (20Tsutsui H. Maeda T. Toyo'oka T. Min J.Z. Inagaki S. Higashi T. Kagawa Y. J. Proteome.

The lysine adduct was discussed as one of several potential biomarker candidates related to diabetes mellitus. N6-formyl lysine is formed in vitro by reaction of albumin with trichloroethylene oxide, a major metabolite of 1,1,2-trichloroethylene, one of the most common compounds found in chemical waste dumps (21Cai H. Guengerich F.P. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 327-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, it could be identified in incubation mixtures of various sugars, l-ascorbic acid or l-dehydroascorbic acid with poly-l-lysine and β-lactoglobulin, respectively (22Hasenkopf K. Rönner B. Hiller H. Pischetsrieder M. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2002; 50: 5697-5703Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Jiang et al. (23Jiang T. Zhou X. Taghizadeh K. Dong M. Dedon P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) observed transfer of formyl groups from 3′-formylphosphate-ended DNA, arising from oxidation of the 5′-position of deoxyribose and subsequent DNA strand breakage by the enediyne antibiotic neocarzinostatin, to histone proteins in human TK6 cells to give N6-formyl lysine. The aim of the present work was to elucidate formation and relevance of the four amide-AGEs N6-acetyl lysine, N6-formyl lysine, N6-lactoyl lysine, and N6-glycerinyl lysine (structures are shown in Fig. 5) in vivo with regard to non-enzymatic mechanisms within the Maillard reaction. Therefore, the free adducts were analyzed in human blood plasma by means of an LC-MS/MS technique. In model experiments, formation from glucose, the physiological most important sugar, and from various α-dicarbonyl structures as direct precursors was confirmed. Comparison of in vivo with in vitro results allowed us to assess the impact of Maillard chemistry on amide-AGE formation in vivo. DISCUSSIONPerforming several model incubations, we tried to gain insights into possible formation pathways linked to Maillard chemistry in vivo. N6-{2-[(5-amino-5-carboxypentyl)amino]-2-oxoethyl}lysine and N6-glycoloyl lysine are formed via rearrangement reactions of glyoxal with lysine in contrast to the novel amide-AGEs involving β-dicarbonyl fragmentations (Fig. 4). We already investigated the degradation of the α-dicarbonyl 1-DG in the presence of N1-t-Boc-lysine, identifying 1-DG as a direct precursor of the amide-AGEs (7Smuda M. Voigt M. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 6458-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Now, glucosone was found to be another potential precursor of formyl lysine, while degradation of 3-DG did not result in any acylation. This is expected because 3-DG in contrast to 1-DG and glucosone cannot be converted to an α-oxoenediol, which is a prerequisite for β-dicarbonyl fragmentations. As shown in Fig. 5, all three C6-dicarbonyl structures are known Maillard degradation products of glucose. Although 1-DG and 3-DG are generated non-oxidatively via enolization and dehydration from the Amadori product, glucosone is formed via autoxidation of glucose or oxidation of the Amadori product or the intermediate Schiff base (31Gobert J. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2009; 57: 8591-8597Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).The results of incubations of glucose with N1-t-Boc-lysine and of the Amadori product of both revealed a very similar formation pattern for acetyl lysine and lactoyl lysine in reaction mixtures with glucose and 1-DG, respectively (Table 4 and Fig. 3), confirming 1-DG as the direct precursor independent from oxidative processes via hydrolytic β-dicarbonyl fragmentation. Although the formation of formyl lysine from 1-DG responded to oxidative conditions, the difference was far more pronounced from glucose or the Amadori product. This pointed to the existence of another precursor emerging from oxidative pathways, which was identified as glucosone. Here, formyl lysine was detected in significant amounts, whereas formation of all other target amides was negligible. These findings were further supported by the same ratio of acetyl to formyl lysine in 1-DG versus glucose incubations under deaerated conditions, i.e. glucosone contributes only under oxidative conditions to formation of formyl lysine from glucose, whereas 1-DG is the sole precursor in absence of oxygen. As formyl lysine, glycerinyl lysine showed a significant discrepancy in glucose versus 1-DG incubations induced by aeration. From the present results the additional reaction pathway leading to glycerinyl lysine from glucose remained unclear as none of the other Maillard intermediates responded. However, it is obvious that oxidation is required and that glucosone is not a relevant precursor.Comparing the results of in vivo samples with above model experiments, incubations under aerated conditions should simulate the situation in uremia. Uremia has been described as a state of inflammatory stress resulting from either increased oxidation of carbohydrates and lipids (oxidative stress) or inadequate detoxification or inactivation of reactive carbonyl compounds derived from both carbohydrates and lipids by oxidative and non-oxidative chemistry (carbonyl stress) (3Miyata T. van Ypersele de Strihou C. Kurokawa K. Baynes J.W. Kidney Int. 1999; 55: 389-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Including only non-diabetic subjects in the present study, the impact of differences in glucose plasma concentrations was avoided.The comparison gave a very diverse picture. Although all target amides in vivo were significantly increased in uremia (Fig. 1), only formyl and glycerinyl lysine responded to aeration in the glucose-lysine model. In addition, the ratio of concentrations between the single amides was completely different. In vivo, acetyl, formyl, and lactoyl lysine were within the same range, with glycerinyl lysine showing 10-fold lower concentrations. In contrast, glucose incubations showed the smallest concentrations for lactoyl lysine. Given that glycerinyl lysine indeed follows the patterns of the model incubations, this suggests additional pathways for the formation of acetyl, formyl, and lactoyl lysine. An alternative mechanism leading to lactoyl lysine in vivo is the reaction of methylglyoxal with ϵ-amino lysine residues corresponding to our identification of N6-glycoloyl lysine in glyoxal lysine model incubations based on rearrangement reactions. Indeed, when we incubated methylglyoxal with N1-t-Boc-lysine, we found significant amounts of lactoyl lysine independent from the presence of oxygen (Table 4). In vivo, this also explains the 7-fold increase in uremia, as we measured a 4-fold increase in methylglyoxal in such subjects (138 ± 39 versus 496 ± 132 pmol/ml plasma). Concentrations of acetyl lysine were highest in vivo and responded to renal failure by a 2-fold increase. This might be explained by increased cell death triggered by the strong inflammatory processes observed under uremia resulting in accelerated release of acetyl lysine from acetylated histone proteins. In addition, the increased concentration of methylglyoxal in presence of peroxynitrite might also contribute to the acetylation of ϵ-amino lysine residues in vivo. Massari et al. (32Massari J. Tokikawa R. Zanolli L. Tavares M.F. Assunção N.A. Bechara E.J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2010; 23: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) described a mechanism of l-lysine acetylation by a methylglyoxal-peroxynitrite system in vitro. Although the direct reaction of methylglyoxal with proteins probably dominates over that with peroxynitrite, the post-translational acetylation of proteins by radical mechanisms in the presence of methylglyoxal might be a plausible second non-enzymatic pathway to acetyltransferase-catalyzed reactions. Moreover, although much less reactive, H2O2 could replace peroxynitrite in the acetyl-generating reaction from methylglyoxal. The idea to explain the 2-fold increase of formyl lysine in uremia based on the in vitro models is undermined by the fact that neither 1-DG nor glucosone have been detected in vivo so far. An intriguing alternative mechanism might be the with inflammation increased oxidative DNA breakdown to give 3′-formylphosphate-ended DNA fragments as a potential precursor, but again, such species have not been identified in vivo (23Jiang T. Zhou X. Taghizadeh K. Dong M. Dedon P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).As a first attempt to assess the importance of the novel amide-AGEs as clinical markers for kidney failure, plasma levels of the well established lysine modifications CML and CEL were measured additionally. In healthy human subjects, concentrations were within the same range. The AGE levels decreased in the following order: acetyl lysine > CEL ≈ formyl lysine ≈ CML > lactoyl lysine > glycerinyl lysine. In uremia, we observed a 13- to 16-fold increase of CEL and CML. Amide-AGEs showed only a 2- to 8-fold increase. Thus, amide-AGEs might be of major importance when compared with other AGE structures identified in vivo so far, even though the impact of uremia on plasma concentrations of CML and CEL is more pronounced.In conclusion, we previously proposed a formation mechanism for the novel amide-AGEs acetyl, formyl, lactoyl, and glycerinyl lysine via degradation of 1-DG in the presence of lysine (7Smuda M. Voigt M. Glomb M.A. J. Agric. Food Chem. 2010; 58: 6458-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Now, glucosone and methylglyoxal were identified as alternative precursors for formyl and lactoyl lysine, respectively. All four amide-AGEs were unequivocally detected in human plasma, formyl, lactoyl, and glycerinyl lysine for the first time. The results strongly suggest a major participation of non-enzymatic Maillard mechanisms on amide-AGE formation pathways in vivo paralleled by enzymatic processes. The pathophysiologic consequences of two to 7-fold increased levels of amide-AGE free adducts in plasma of HD patients is not yet understood and requires further investigation. Also, the question which quantities of AGE-free adducts are derived from the breakdown of AGE-modified proteins or from direct synthesis remains unclear. However, absolute plasma concentration levels were in the same range similar to other established lysine modifications, i.e. CML and CEL, and suggest a comparable impact of non-enzymatic biochemistry on pathophysiologies in the human organism. Performing several model incubations, we tried to gain insights into possible formation pathways linked to Maillard chemistry in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2088594930,"Sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) corrects trafficking of ΔF508-CFTR in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) epithelia, which is hypothesized to, at least in part, result from increased expression of Hsp70 (stress-induced 70 kDa heat shock protein). To identify other 4PBA-regulated proteins that may promote correction of ΔF508 trafficking, we performed differential display RT-PCR on mRNA from IB3-1 CF bronchiolar epithelial cells treated for 0-24 h with 1 mM 4PBA. In this screen, a STAT-3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-3)-interacting protein, StIP-1 that regulates STAT-3 activation had transiently increased expression. StIP-1 is identical to Elongator protein 2 (Elp2), a component of the Elongator complex that regulates RNA polymerase II. Previous studies have suggested that Elongator regulates Hsp70 mRNA transcription, and that the Hsp70 promoter contains functional STAT-3-binding sites. We therefore tested the hypothesis that 4PBA increases Hsp70 expression by an Elongator- and STAT-3-dependent mechanism. 4PBA treatment of IB3-1 CF bronchiolar epithelial cells caused transiently increased expression of Hsp70 protein, as well as Elp2 protein and mRNA. Elp2 depletion by transfection of small interfering RNAs, reduced both Elp2 and Hsp70 protein expression. 4PBA also caused transient activation of STAT-3, and increased abundance of nuclear proteins that bind to the STAT-3-responsive element of the Hsp70 promoter. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that both Elp2 overexpression and 4PBA increase Hsp70 promoter activity, while Elp2 depletion blocked the ability of 4PBA to stimulate Hsp70 promoter activity. Together, these data suggest that Elp2 and STAT-3 mediate, at least in part, the stimulation of Hsp70 expression by 4PBA."
https://openalex.org/W2095758403,"We study the evolution of cooperation in the spatial prisoner's dilemma game where players are allowed to establish new interactions with others. By employing a simple coevolutionary rule entailing only two crucial parameters, we find that different selection criteria for the new interaction partners as well as their number vitally affect the outcome of the game. The resolution of the social dilemma is most probable if the selection favors more successful players and if their maximally attainable number is restricted. While the preferential selection of the best players promotes cooperation irrespective of game parametrization, the optimal number of new interactions depends somewhat on the temptation to defect. Our findings reveal that the ""making of new friends"" may be an important activity for the successful evolution of cooperation, but also that partners must be selected carefully and their number limited."
https://openalex.org/W1963944716,"Background Limited information is available on the relationship between nevirapine plasma concentrations and virologic response or liver toxicity in Chinese patients with HIV infection. The objective of this prospective study was to test this relationship and to determine the minimal therapeutic trough concentration of nevirapine for Chinese patients. Methods A total of 227 HIV-infected, treatment naïve patients were enrolled into this study. Blood samples were taken at Ctrough (12 hr postdose) and C2 (2 hr postdose) for measurement of nevirapine concentrations 6 months after treatment initiation. Therapeutic outcomes, viral load and CD4 cell count, were assessed at 3 and 6 months after starting therapy, while the evaluation of hepatotoxicity was undertaken 12 months after nevirapine treatment. Results A significant correlation between nevirapine trough concentrations and viral load was noticed after 6 months of treatment, particularly in patients with partial response and viral failure (p<0.01). The therapeutic Ctrough of nevirapine for Chinese patients was determined to be 3.9 µg/ml using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Virologic failure was observed in 21% (6/29) of patients with low nevirapine concentrations (<3.9 µg/ml) versus 5% (4/87) in patients with concentrations higher than 3.9 µg/ml (p = 0.015). Hepatotoxicity was significantly associated with the median nevirapine trough concentrations among male patients (8.20 vs. 5.48 µg/ml, p = 0.015) and hepatitis C virus co-infection (p = 0.039). Conclusions Among Chinese patients with HIV infection, the therapeutic Ctrough of nevirapine was 3.9 µg/ml, higher than the recommended 3.0 µg/ml. The correlation between nevirapine concentrations, efficacy and hepatotoxicity suggests the benefit of dosage adjustment based on therapeutic drug monitoring among Chinese HIV-infected patients to optimize nevirapine containing antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2065547728,"The development of natural Foxp3+ CD4 regulatory T cells (nTregs) proceeds via two steps that involve the initial antigen dependent generation of CD25+GITRhiFoxp3−CD4+ nTreg precursors followed by the cytokine induction of Foxp3. Using mutant mouse models that lack c-Rel, the critical NF-κB transcription factor required for nTreg differentiation, we establish that c-Rel regulates both of these developmental steps. c-Rel controls the generation of nTreg precursors via a haplo-insufficient mechanism, indicating that this step is highly sensitive to c-Rel levels. However, maintenance of c-Rel in an inactive state in nTreg precursors demonstrates that it is not required for a constitutive function in these cells. While the subsequent IL-2 induction of Foxp3 in nTreg precursors requires c-Rel, this developmental transition does not coincide with the nuclear expression of c-Rel. Collectively, our results support a model of nTreg differentiation in which c-Rel generates a permissive state for foxp3 transcription during the development of nTreg precursors that influences the subsequent IL-2 dependent induction of Foxp3 without a need for c-Rel reactivation."

To this aim, we performed artificial selection based on dispersal distance by choosing 40 individuals (out of 150) that settled furthest from the home patch (high dispersal, HDIS) and 40 individuals that remained close to the home patch (low dispersal, LDIS) with three replicates per treatment. We did not observe a response to selection nor a difference between treatments in life-history traits (fecundity, survival, longevity, and sex-ratio) after ten generations of selection. However, we show that heritability for dispersal distance depends on density. Heritability for dispersal distance was low and non-significant when using the same density as the artificial selection experiments while heritability becomes significant at a lower density. Furthermore, we show that maternal effects may have influenced the dispersal behaviour of the mites. Our results suggest primarily that selection did not work because high density and maternal effects induced phenotypic plasticity for dispersal distance. Density and maternal effects may affect the evolution of dispersal distance and should be incorporated into future theoretical and empirical studies."

IL-7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) on thymocytes and T cells is rapidly internalized upon IL-7 ligation. Ephrins (Efns) are cell surface molecules and ligands of the largest receptor kinase family, Eph kinases. We discovered that T cell-specific double gene knock-out (dKO) of Efnb1 and Efnb2 in mice led to reduced IL-7Rα expression in thymocytes and T cells, and that IL-7Rα down-regulation was accelerated in dKO CD4 cells upon IL-7 treatment. On the other hand, Efnb1 and Efnb2 overexpression on T cell lymphoma EL4 cells retarded IL-7Rα down-regulation. dKO T cells manifested compromised STAT5 activation and homeostatic proliferation, an IL-7-dependent process. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and immunoprecipitation demonstrated that Efnb1 and Efnb2 interacted physically with IL-7Rα. Such interaction likely retarded IL-7Rα internalization, as Efnb1 and Efnb2 were not internalized. Therefore, we revealed a novel function of Efnb1 and Efnb2 in stabilizing IL-7Rα expression at the post-translational level, and a previously unknown modus operandi of Efnbs in the regulation of expression of other vital cell surface receptors.

IL-7 receptors (IL-7R) are composed of IL-7Rα (CD127) and the common γ chain (CD132), which are shared by IL-2R, IL-4R, IL-9R, and IL-15R (1Aspinall R. Mech.

Immunol. 2010; 184: 3768-3779Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). IL-7Rα expression at the mRNA level is suppressed by IL-7 treatment, but needs several hours or even several days to occur. At the post-translational level, IL-7Rα is rapidly internalized within minutes upon IL-7 engagement, and this endocytosis is clathrin-dependent (8Henriques C.M. Rino J. Nibbs R.J. Graham G.J. Barata J.T. Blood. 2010; 115: 3269-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Such regulation at the transcriptional and post-translational levels is likely a negative regulatory loop controlling the strength and duration of IL-7 signaling. Erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular kinases (Eph) 2The abbreviations used are: Epherythropoietin-producing hepatocellular kinaseEfnephrinPEphycoerythrinABacceptor photobleachingSEsensitized emissionCFSEcarboxyfluorescein succinimidyl esterdKOdouble knock-out. are the largest family of cell surface receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising about 25% of known receptor tyrosine kinases (9Eph Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). A total of 15 Ephs are classified into A and B subfamilies according to their sequence homology; the former has 9 members and the latter, 6, although not all are expressed in a given species (10Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The ligands of Ephs, ephrins (Efns), are also cell surface molecules (9Eph Nomenclature CommitteeCell. 1997; 90: 403-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Nine Efns are divided into A and B subfamilies according to the way they anchor to the cell surface.

Interactions between Ephs and Efns are promiscuous. One Eph can interact with multiple Efns and vice versa. In general, EphA members preferentially interact with EfnA members, and EphB members with EfnB members (10Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar, 12Wang H.U. Chen Z.F. Anderson D.J. Cell. 1998; 93: 741-753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Such promiscuous interactions indicate that these molecules are so vital to biological systems that heavy redundancy is essential. Although they are ligands, Efns can also transduce signals into cells (10Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) in a phenomenon known as “reverse signaling.” Interaction between Eph and Efns results in signaling in both directions, hence, bidirectional signaling. Because Ephs and Efns are both cell surface molecules, they will normally be activated locally by their binding partners expressed on opposing cells during physical contact. Consequently, the major functions of Ephs and Efns are related to pattern formation; however, additional functions unrelated to pattern formation have recently been observed. Most reported functions of Ephs occur in the central nervous system where they are expressed in neurons and control axon and dendrite positioning (10Wilkinson D.G. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 196: 177-244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Flanagan J.G. Vanderhaeghen P. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1998; 21: 309-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). They are essential in the development of neuronal connections, circuit plasticity, and repair. Some Ephs and Efns also play important roles in other cells and organs, as described below and reviewed by Pasquale (13Pasquale E.B. Cell. 2008; 133: 38-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). They are expressed on endothelial cells and are vital in angiogenesis during normal embryonic development as well as in tumorigenesis. Intestinal epithelial cells express different levels of some Eph and Efnb family members that modulate the movement of epithelial cells along the crypt axis to maintain epithelium self-renewal. Ephb2 and Efnb2 are expressed on the endoderm during embryonic development and their bidirectional interaction is essential in urorectal development. Pancreatic β-cells communicate with each other via Epha and Efna family members to synchronize their insulin secretion in response to blood glucose fluctuations. Several Ephb and Efnb family members are expressed on osteoclasts and osteoblasts where they regulate bone development, maintenance, and repair. Multiple Eph and Efn members have been found to be expressed in some cancer cells and they appear to influence cancer cell growth. Ephb4 and Efnb2 are expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells and regulate red blood cell production in response to hypoxia. Efnb1 and Epha4 expression in platelets contributes to the clotting process. Efnb1 expression on kidney epithelial cells (podocytes) likely plays a role in glomerular filtration. Interaction between Ephb2 and Efnb2 regulates the ionic homeostasis of vestibular endolymph fluid in the inner ear. Our group and others have reported that Ephs and Efns, particularly their B family members, as well as some A family members are expressed in thymocytes and T cells; they are capable of modulating T-cell responses and survival (for a comprehensive review on the role of Eph/Efn in the immune system, see Ref. 14Wu J. Luo H. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2005; 12: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We have shown that Efnb1, Efnb2, and Efnb3 forward signaling through their Eph receptors can co-stimulate peripheral T cells by enhancing cytokine production and proliferation in vitro. We have also demonstrated that one of these Efn receptors, Ephb6, although lacking kinase activity, can transmit signals into T cells, and that its null mutation results in compromised T-cell responses in vitro and in vivo. However, Ephb6 null mutants have normal thymus structure and thymocyte development, probably due to complementary functions of other Eph family members. In the present study, we discovered that Efnb1 and Efnb2 interact with IL-7Rα on the cell surface and such interaction delays internalization of the latter upon IL-7 stimulation. The significance of this finding is discussed. Single cell suspensions from the thymus, spleen, or lymph nodes as well as T cell lymphoma EL4 and CHO cells were prepared and stained for flow cytometry as described in our previous publication (15Luo H. Yu G. Tremblay J. Wu J. J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 114: 1762-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar).

PE-Cy7-streptavidin was from eBioscience (San Diego, CA); PE-rat anti-mouse CD25 (clone PC61) Ab was from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Burlington, ON, Canada). Eight- to 10-week-old C57BL/6 (CD45.2+) × C57B6.SJL (CD45.1+) F1 mice were irradiated at 1,100 rads. Twenty-four h later, they received 4 × 106 T cell-depleted bone marrow cells in a 1:1 ratio from C57/B6.SJL and dKO mice of the C57BL/6 background. WT mouse bone marrow was used as control. Eight to 10 weeks after bone marrow transplantation, spleen cells of the recipients were analyzed by flow cytometry. dKO or WT control spleen T cells and CD4 cells were purified with EasySepTM T Cell Enrichment Kit (Stemcell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) or Miltanyi magnetic beads (Miltanyi Biotech, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), respectively. These cells were reacted with or without IL-7 (20 ng/ml) at 37 °C for the periods indicated. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (CompleteTM Protease Inhibitor Mixture and PhosSTOP Phosphatase Inhibitor Mixture, Roche Diagnostics). The lysates were resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE. Proteins on the gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and blotted with rabbit anti-mouse phospho-STAT5 (Tyr-694) mAb (clone C11C5; 1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare). The membranes were then stripped and re-blotted with rabbit anti-mouse STAT5 mAb (clone 3H7; 1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology) to assess total STAT5 expression. Signals were detected with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). For immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed and the lysates (500 μg/sample) were precipitated with rabbit anti-Myc polyclonal Ab-coated agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 4 οC for 4 h. The precipitated proteins were resolved in 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blotted with HRP-conjugated rat anti-HA mAb (clone 3F10, Roche Diagnostics). The membranes were then stripped and re-blotted with HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-Myc Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for the detection of Myc-tagged proteins. In vivo T cell proliferation was monitored with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) labeling. T cells from dKO mice or control WT mice in the C57BL/6 background (CD45.2+) were labeled with CFSE (5 μm for 5 min at room temperature). Four million labeled T cells in 200 μl of PBS were transferred intravenously to sublethally irradiated (600 rads) B6.SJL mice (CD45.1+). Six days later, recipient spleen cells were stained with Pacific Blue-rat anti-CD45.2, PerCP-rat anti-CD4 or APC-rat anti-CD8 mAbs, and analyzed by 4-color flow cytometry. WT naive CD4 cells from lymph nodes were first activated in wells precoated with hamster anti-mouse CD3ϵ mAb (clone 145–2C11, BD Biosciences) and rat anti-mouse CD28 mAb (clone 37.51.1, Cedarlane Laboratories) for 48 h to increase cell cytoplasm content for better visualization during imaging. The cells were washed and left resting for 4 days until their IL-7Rα expression returned to the pre-stimulation level. These activated CD4 and EL4 cells were cultured in medium with or without IL-7 (20 ng/ml) for 1–3 h, washed, and stained with FITC-rat anti-mouse CD4 mAb (clones GK1.5, BD Biosciences) or FITC-rat anti-mouse Thy1.2 mAb (clone 53–2.1, BD Biosciences). The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde on ice for 30 min and permeabilized for 30 min with ice-cold PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100. After being blocked with 0.25% gelatin, 0.01% saponin, 1% rat serum (blocking buffer), they were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated rat anti-mouse IL-7Rα (clone SB/199, BioLegend), washed in blocking buffer, and stained with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa Fluor-568 for an additional hour. Fluorescence signals were detected with a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Inc., Exton, PA). IL-7Rα mRNA levels were measured by RT-quantitative PCR. Forward primer 5′-GGATGGAGACCTAGAAGATG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGTTAGGCATTTCACTCGT-3′ were used to generate a 175-bp fragment for mouse IL-7Rα. PCR conditions for the reactions were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C, 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 20 s at 58 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. β-Actin mRNA levels were considered as internal controls. The data were first calculated as signal ratios of Efnb1 mRNA/β-actin mRNA and Efnb2 mRNA/β-actin mRNA. These ratios in different experiments were then normalized, and the final data were expressed as relative expression of IL-7Rα mRNA with the signal ratio of WT cells set as 1 unit. PCR fragments containing the full-length coding sequences of Efnb1 and Efnb2 were retrieved from cDNA clones 3602195 and 6827408 from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL), employing the primer pairs 5′-ACGCG GCCGC ATCCT GAAGT-3′(forward)/5′-ACCTC GAGCA TGCTG GG-3′(reverse) and 5′-ACGCG GCCGC AGAAC TGGGA GCGGC TTGG-3′(forward)/5′-ACCTC GAGAA GAACA AGGTG-3′ (reverse), respectively. Fragments were first subcloned into pCR-TA Vector® (Invitrogen) and subsequently into an episomal mammalian expression vector pCEP4TM (Invitrogen) at NotI and XhoI sites downstream of the CMV promoter. The resulting plasmids were named pCEP-Efnb1 and pCEP-Efnb2. EL4 cells were transfected with these constructs by electroporation. The transfectants were selected with hygromycin B to achieve stable Efnb1 and Efnb2 overexpression. For Efnb1 and Efnb2 overexpression in CHO cells, the full-length coding sequences of Efnb1 and Efnb2 were cloned into p-ReceiverM08 (Genecopoeia, Rockville, MD), and constructs named p-Receiver-Efnb1-Myc and p-Receiver-Efnb2-Myc served for stable expression of C-terminal Myc-tagged Efnb1 and Efnb2. The stable transfectants were selected with G418, and then transiently transfected with p-ReceiverIL-7Rα-HA (Genecopoeia) for C-terminal HA-tagged IL-7Rα expression; the cells were harvested after 30 h for immunoprecipitation studies. The direct association between IL-7Rα and Efnb1 or Efnb2 was assessed by FRET. Efnb1-EL4 and Efnb2-EL4 cells were first incubated on ice for 45 min with biotinylated rat anti-IL-7Rα mAb (clone SB/199, BioLegend) and goat anti-mouse Efnb1 Ab or goat anti-mouse Efnb2 Ab (both from R & D Systems), respectively. As negative controls, Efnb1-EL4 and Efnb2-EL4 cells were incubated with biotinylated rat anti-mouse Thy1.2 mAb (clone 30H12, BioLegend) and goat anti-mouse Efnb1 Ab or goat anti-mouse Efnb2 Ab, respectively. The test and control cells were reacted with Alexa Fluor-488-conjugated streptavidin for IL-7Rα (for both cross-linking and staining of IL-7Rα; Invitrogen), and with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG F(ab′)2 fragments (for both cross-linking and staining of Efnb1 and Efnb2; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 4 °C. The cells were transferred to a 37 °C water bath and incubated for 10 min to allow cross-linking to occur; then, they were immediately fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Finally, the cells were washed, mounted on glass slides, and the FRET signal was examined under a Leica TCS SP5 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Alexa Fluor-488 was the donor fluorophore, and rhodamine, the acceptor fluorophore. FRET was measured with both acceptor photobleaching (AB) and sensitized emission (SE) by FRET AB Wizard and FRET SE Wizard software (Leica Microsystems Inc.). All the necessary controls for AB and SE, such as cells with various single fluorescence staining, were performed to satisfy background deductions in calculating FRET efficiency, as required by the software. AB FRET efficiency was calculated by fluorescence intensity of the donor before (Dpre) and after (Dpost) acceptor-selective photo bleaching, according to the following formula: AB FRET efficiency = (Dpost − Dpre)/Dpost. SE FRET efficiency was calculated based on the formula described by Woulters et al. (16Wouters F.S. Verveer P.J. Bastiaens P.I. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 203-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar): SE FRET efficiency = (B − A × b − C × c)/C; where B is FRET (indirect acceptor signal); A is donor emission (donor signal); b is the donor emission cross-talk ratio obtained from samples stained with donor fluorescence only: b = Bdonor/Adonor; C is acceptor emission (direct acceptor signal); c is the acceptor excitation cross-talk ratio obtained from samples stained with acceptor fluorescence only: c = Bacceptor/Cacceptor. To study the function of Efnb1 and Efnb2 in the T cell compartment, we generated conditional dKO mice with T cell-specific deletion of Efnb1 and Efnb1, using a proximal Lck promoter-driven Cre recombinase system. The proximal Lck promoter-caused Efn1 and Efnb2 deletion became effective starting from DN3 (17Lee P.P. Fitzpatrick D.R. Beard C. Jessup H.K. Lehar S. Makar K.W. Pérez-Melgosa M. Sweetser M.T. Schlissel M.S. Nguyen S. Cherry S.R. Tsai J.H. Tucker S.M. Weaver W.M. Kelso A. Jaenisch R. Wilson C.B. Immunity. 2001; 15: 763-774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Mice with floxed Efnb1/Efnb1 served as controls and were designated hereafter as wild type (WT). dKO mice manifested a significant phenotype, including about a 2-fold decrease in thymus weight and cellularity, and about a 2-fold reduction in spleen weight and spleen T cell number (18Luo H. Charpentier T. Wang X. Qi S. Han B. Wu T. Terra R. Lamarre A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. October 5, 2011; 10.1074/jbc.M111.302596Google Scholar). Interestingly, we noticed that IL-7Rα expression was suppressed in most dKO thymocyte subpopulations and the decline was significant in DN3, DN4, CD4SP, and CD8 SP cells (Fig. 1A). DP cells are known to have low IL-7Rα expression (19Munitic I. Williams J.A. Yang Y. Dong B. Lucas P.J. El Kassar N. Gress R.E. Ashwell J.D. Blood. 2004; 104: 4165-4172Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), which could explain the less than significant diminution of this subpopulation. In the periphery, CD3+ T cells but not B cells from the control spleen expressed high IL-7Rα levels (Fig. 1B). IL-7Rα expression was significantly decreased in dKO spleen CD3+ T cells. Because moderate T lymphopenia (18Luo H. Charpentier T. Wang X. Qi S. Han B. Wu T. Terra R. Lamarre A. Wu J. J. Biol. Chem. October 5, 2011; 10.1074/jbc.M111.302596Google Scholar) occurred in dKO mice, it might in theory trigger a compensatory increase of IL-7 secretion, which could, in turn, down-regulate IL-7Rα in T cells. To investigate this possibility, we co-transplanted dKO or WT bone marrow cells in the CD45.2 background (C57BL/6) along with bone marrow cells from B6.SJL mice of the CD45.1 background into lethally irradiated C57BL/6 x SJL F1 recipients. Cells from dKO donors competed poorly with cells from B6.SJL donors to develop into mature T cells (Fig. 1C). Spleen CD4 and CD8 cells derived from WT donor cells had IL-7Rα expression similar to that derived from co-transplanted B6.SJL donor cells (Fig. 1C, upper panel), whereas CD4 and CD8 cells derived from dKO donor cells manifested reduced IL-7α expression, compared with cells derived from B6.SJL donor cells (Fig. 1C, lower panel). As competitor B6.SJL T cells and dKO T cells shared the same in vivo environment, IL-7Rα down-regulation observed in dKO mice is not due to possibly increased IL-7 levels in vivo in these mice. Does reduced IL-7Rα in dKO T cells compromise IL-7R signaling? As illustrated in Fig. 1D, upon IL-7 stimulation, spleen T and CD4 cells from dKO mice indeed presented dampened STAT5 phosphorylation, a critical signaling event in the IL-7R signaling pathway. We then assessed the functional consequence of reduced IL-7Rα expression in T cells in vivo. IL-7 is vital for T cell homeostatic expansion (2Takada K. Jameson S.C. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). We transferred CFSE-labeled dKO or WT spleen T cells into sublethally irradiated B6.SJL mice. As seen in Fig. 1E, the transferred dKO CD4 and CD8 T cells both showed significantly lower homeostatic proliferation in vivo compared with control WT T cells. Such compromised proliferation was consistent with the failed competition of dKO cells against B6.SJL cells as depicted in Fig. 1C. This suggests that reduced IL-7Rα expression in T cells does have functional consequences and contributes to compromised homeostatic expansion in vivo. The mechanism by which Efnb1 and Efnb2 modulate IL-7Rα expression was investigated herewith. Rapid internalization of IL-7Rα upon IL-7 engagement (8Henriques C.M. Rino J. Nibbs R.J. Graham G.J. Barata J.T. Blood. 2010; 115: 3269-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was confirmed with both T cell lymphoma EL4 cells (Fig. 2A) and WT lymph node CD4 cells (Fig. 2B). IL-7Rα was detectable on the surface of these cells by confocal microscopy in the absence of IL-7 (Fig. 2, A and B, top row, panel I), and was located at a similar position as cell surface Thy1.2 or CD4 (Fig. 2, A and B, top row, panels II and III). After 3 h of IL-7 exposure, Thy1.2 and CD4 remained on the cell surface (Fig. 2, A and B, middle row, panel II) but IL-7Rα, being still detectable, was largely internalized and moved into the cytoplasm inside Thy1.2 or CD4 circles (Fig. 2, A and B, middle row, panels II and III). At the same time, IL-7Rα expression was drastically reduced on the surface of EL4 cells and spleen CD4 cells (Fig. 2, A and B, bottom row) upon IL-7 stimulation, whereas Th1.2 and CD4 expression on these cells remained unchanged in the absence or presence of IL-7, according to flow cytometry, further proving that IL-7-triggered IL-7Rα internalization in these cells. We further demonstrated that after receiving IL-7 stimulation, WT naive CD4 T cells (CD44loCD62Lhi) showed a time-dependent reduction (assayed at 20, 50, and 90 min) of IL-7Rα on the cell surface (Fig. 3A, left panel), mainly due to its internalization, as described above. Efnb1 and Efnb2 deletion (i.e. dKO) in these cells resulted in a greater rate of IL-7Rα reduction (Fig. 3A, right panel), whereas the IL-7Rα mRNA level was not affected by the absence of Efnb1 and Efnb2, or the presence of IL-7 (Fig. 3B) within the 90-min period, indicating that IL-7Rα down-regulation in CD4 cells upon IL-7 stimulation occurs at the post-translational level in this period. We wondered whether the opposite was also true: i.e. Efnb1 and Efnb2 overexpression would retard IL-7Rα down-regulation upon IL-7 stimulation. For this purpose, T cell lymphoma EL4 cells were stably transfected with Efnb1 and Efnb2 expression constructs pCEP-Efnb1 or pCEP-Efnb2, respectively. Efnb1 and Efnb2 overexpression on the cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S1A), and the cells were named Efnb1-EL4 and Efnb2-EL4, respectively. Their cell surface IL-7Rα down-regulation upon IL-7 exposure was significantly retarded, when compared with EL4 cells transfected with empty vector (vector-EL4; Fig. 3C). On the other hand, IL-7Rα mRNA levels in Efnb1-EL4 and Efnb2-EL4 cells were comparable with vector-EL4 cells, in the absence or presence of IL-7 (Fig. 3D), confirming that IL-7Rα down-regulation is at the post-transcriptional level during this time frame. Taken together, these findings confirm that the presence of Efnb1 and Efnb2 retards IL-7Rα down-regulation on the T cell surface upon IL-7 stimulation; conversely, the absence of Efnb1 and Efnb2 accelerates IL-7-triggered IL-7Rα down-regulation. In contrast to IL-7Rα, Efnb1 and Efnb2 expression after anti-Efnb1 or -Efnb2 Ab cross-linking (supplemental Figs. S1B and S1C, middle row) or IL-7 treatment (bottom row) remained largely unchanged, compared with cells cultured in plain medium (upper row). We then questioned whether Efnb1 and Efnb2 associated physically with IL-7Rα as a mechanism to reduce IL-7Rα internalization. When Efnb1-EL4 cells were cross-linked with anti-Efnb1 Ab plus anti-IL-7Rα Ab, both Efnb1 and IL-7Rα formed caps within 10 min before IL-7Rα internalization occurred. Efnb1 and IL-7Rα co-localized in the cap on the cell surface (Fig. 4A, left panel), whereas Efnb1 and Thy1.2 did not co-cap when Efnb1-EL4 cells were cross-linked with anti-Efnb1 Ab plus anti-Thy1.2 Ab (Fig. 4A, right panel). Similarly, Efnb2 and IL-7Rα co-capping was also manifested in Efnb2-EL4 cells when cross-linked with anti-Efnb2 Ab plus anti-IL-7Rα Ab (Fig. 4B, left panel), but Efnb2 and Thy1.2 did not co-cap when Efnb2-EL4 cells were cross-linked with anti-Efnb2 plus anti-Thy1.2 Ab (Fig. 4B, right panel). The co-migration of Efnb1 or Efnb2 with IL-7Rα raises the possibility that Efnb1 and Efnb2 may directly associate with IL-7Rα on the T cell surface. It should be noted that if only 1 Ab (i.e. anti-IL-7Rα or anti-Efnb1 Ab) was used in the cross-linking step, IL-7Rα and Efnb1 (or Efnb2) would still undergo discernible but faint co-capping between Efnb1 and IL-7Rα, or between Efnb2 and IL-7Rα, respectively, under the microscope, but the resulting images were not satisfactory for illustration. This was mainly due to a technical difficulty: the cells needed to be fixed to terminate cross-linking, but the other Ab (the one not deployed in initial cross-linking) could not stain fixed cells as well as fresh cells, whereas in double cross-linking experiments (Fig. 4), both Abs (i.e. anti-IL-7Rα and anti-Efnb1 Ab) reacted with fresh cells.

STAT-activated gene expression is both rapid and transient and requires dynamic post-translational modification of the chromatin template. We previously showed that monoubiquitination of histone H2B (ubH2B) is highly dynamic at the STAT1 target gene, interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1), suggesting that a deubiquitinase is recruited during gene activation. Here, we report that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the ubiquitin hydrolase, USP22, results in 2-fold higher ubH2B, and 2-fold lower transcriptional elongation at IRF1. We also demonstrate that USP22 depletion diminishes 3′-end cleavage/polyadenylation by 2- to 3-fold. Furthermore, the polyadenylation factor CPSF73 is not effectively recruited, and serine 2 phosphorylation (Ser2P) of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II is also disrupted. The transcriptional and processing defects observed in the USP22-knock-down cells are reversed by transient USP22 overexpression. Together, these results suggest that ubH2B helps recruit polyadenylation factors to STAT1-activated genes. We propose a working model, wherein a cycle of H2B ubiquitination/deubiquitination specifies Ser2P to regulate elongation and 3′-end processing of JAK-STAT-inducible mRNAs. These results further elaborate USP22 function and its role as a putative cancer stem cell marker.—Chipumuro, E., Henriksen, M. A.

The ability of this chemokine to enhance migration of IgA-ASCs to mucosal sites was assessed in a mouse immunization model using HIV-1IIIB Virus-like particles (VLPs). Mice receiving either HIV-1IIIB VLPs alone, CCL28 alone, or the irrelevant CCL19 chemokine were used as controls. Results showed a significantly increased CCR3 and CCR10 expression on CD19+ splenocytes of HIV-1IIIB VPL-CCL28-treated mice. HIV-1 Env-specific IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-5 production, total IgA, anti-Env IgA as well as gastro-intestinal mucosal IgA-secreting plasma cells were also significantly augmented in these mice. Notably, sera and vaginal secretions from HIV-1IIIB VLP-CCL28-treated mice exhibited an enhanced neutralizing activity against both a HIV-1/B-subtype laboratory strain and a heterologous HIV-1/C-subtype primary isolate. These data suggest that CCL28 could be useful in enhancing the IgA immune response that will likely play a pivotal role in prophylactic HIV vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2010035933,"Background QuantiFERON-TB Gold In Tube (QFT-GIT) is a tool for detecting M. tuberculosis infection. However, interpretation and utility of serial QFT-GIT testing of pediatric tuberculosis (TB) contacts is not well understood. We compared TB prevalence between baseline and 6 months follow-up using QFT-GIT and tuberculin skin testing (TST) in children who were household contacts of adults with pulmonary TB in South Africa, and explored factors associated with QFT-GIT conversions and reversions. Method Prospective study with six month longitudinal follow-up. Results Among 270 enrolled pediatric contacts, 196 (73%) underwent 6-month follow-up testing. The 6-month prevalence estimate of MTB infection in pediatric contacts increased significantly from a baseline of 29% (79/270, 95%CI [24–35]) to 38% (103/270, 95% CI [32–44], p<0.001) using QFT-GIT; prevalence increased from a baseline of 28% (71/254, 95%CI [23–34]) to 33% (88/263, 95%CI [21–32], p = 0.002) using TST. Prevalence estimates were influenced by thresholds for positivity for TST, but not for QFT-GIT. Among 134 children with a negative or indeterminate baseline QFT-GIT, 24 (18%) converted to positive at follow-up; conversion rates did not differ significantly when using more stringent thresholds to define QFT-GIT conversion. Older age >10 years (AOR 8.9 95%CI [1.1–72]) and baseline TST positivity ≥5 mm (AOR 5.2 95%CI [1.2–23]) were associated with QFT-GIT conversion. Among 62 children with a positive baseline QFT-GIT, 9 (15%) reverted to negative; female gender (AOR 18.5 95%CI [1.1–321]; p = 0.04] was associated with reversion, while children with baseline positive TST were less likely to have QFT-GIT reversion (AOR 0.01 95%CI [0.001–0.24]). Conclusion Among pediatric contacts of adult household TB cases in South Africa, prevalence estimates of TB infection increased significantly from baseline to 6 months. Conversions and reversions occurred among pediatric TB contacts using QFT-GIT, but QFT-GIT conversion rates were less influenced by thresholds used for conversions than were TST conversion rates."

The process is mediated by a surface receptor composed of transferrin-binding proteins A and B (TbpA and TbpB). TbpA is an integral outer membrane protein that functions as a gated channel for the passage of iron into the periplasm. TbpB is a surface-exposed lipoprotein that facilitates the iron uptake process. In this study, we demonstrate that the region encompassing amino acids 7–40 of Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae TbpB is required for forming a complex with TbpA and that the formation of the complex requires the presence of porcine Tf. These results are consistent with a model in which TbpB is responsible for the initial capture of iron-loaded Tf and subsequently interacts with TbpA through the anchor peptide.

The ability of strains deficient in either TbpA or TbpB to bind Tf indicates that both receptor proteins are capable of binding to Tf, and specifically, to the C-terminal lobe of Tf (7Alcantara J.

Although growth on Tf as a sole iron source is possible in the absence of TbpB, there are varying degrees of growth impairment of TbpB-deficient strains in vitro with Tf as the sole source of iron (4Gray-Owen S.D.

Studies with a TbpB-deficient strain of the porcine pathogen Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae demonstrated that although growth with porcine Tf as the iron source was possible in vitro, the strain was avirulent and unable to colonize the host, suggesting that TbpB is essential for iron acquisition in vivo (10Baltes N. Hennig-Pauka I. Gerlach G.F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 209: 283-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that TbpB may play a role in the efficient capture of the iron-loaded form of Tf (11Krell T. Renauld-Mongénie G. Nicolaï M.C. Fraysse S. Chevalier M. Bérard Y. Oakhill J. Evans R.W. Gorringe A. Lissolo L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14712-14722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) because TbpB, but not TbpA, has a strong preference for binding to the iron-loaded form of Tf (12Retzer M.D. Yu R. Zhang Y. Gonzalez G.C. Schryvers A.B. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 25: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 13Yu R.H. Schryvers A.B. Microb. Pathog. 1993; 15: 433-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The relative susceptibility of the receptor proteins in wild-type and mutant gonococci to protease treatment has led to the conclusion that TbpA and TbpB interact in the outer membrane (14Cornelissen C.N. Sparling P.F. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protection from proteolysis of TbpB by TbpA is dependent upon interaction with TonB (15Cornelissen C.N. Anderson J.E. Sparling P.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 25-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that the TbpB-TbpA interaction is linked to the iron acquisition process. Similarly, the conclusion that TbpA and TbpB “work together” during the association phase of binding radiolabeled Tf (16DeRocco A.J. Yost-Daljev M.K. Kenney C.D. Cornelissen C.N. Biometals. 2009; 22: 439-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) implies that there is an intimate association between the receptors during the Tf binding step. However, experiments with gold-labeled antibodies in electron micrograph experiments demonstrated that TbpA and TbpB are not co-localized in the absence of added Tf (17Powell N.B. Bishop K. Palmer H.M. Ala'Aldeen D.A. Gorringe A.R. Borriello S.P. J. Med. Microbiol. 1998; 47: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), suggesting that they do not normally constitute a preformed receptor complex in the membrane. Thus the physical association of the receptor proteins may largely be limited to receptors actively involved in the iron acquisition process. Recent structural studies with TbpB demonstrate that the C-terminal and N-terminal lobes have similar structural features and that the relatively unstructured N-terminal anchor peptide is associated with the C-terminal lobe. These studies have also revealed that the binding interface for Tf on TbpB is localized to a “Cap region” of the N-terminal lobe, on the opposite surface from the start of the anchor peptide region (18Moraes T.F.

There are no indications of Tf interacting with the TbpB C-terminal lobe region (20Silva L.P. Yu R. Calmettes C. Yang X. Moraes T.F. Schryvers A.B. Schriemer D.C. J. Biol.

Because the anchor peptide protrudes from the opposite side of the binding interface on the TbpB N-terminal lobe and associates with the C-terminal lobe, it is unlikely to directly participate in interactions with Tf (18Moraes T.F.

However, the location of the anchor peptide between the Tf-binding N-lobe and the surface of the outer membrane suggests that it might play a role in modulating the position of the TbpB N-lobe relative to the outer membrane surface. There is a large domain movement observed in structures of the holo (iron-loaded) and apo (iron-free) forms of Tf (22MacGillivray R.T. Moore S.A. Chen J. Anderson B.F. Baker H. Luo Y. Bewley M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7919-7928Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), from a “closed” to an “open” conformation. The interaction of TbpB with holoTf involves regions on both the C1 and the C2 domains of the C-lobe (20Silva L.P. Yu R. Calmettes C. Yang X. Moraes T.F. Schryvers A.B. Schriemer D.C. J. Biol.

Schryvers A.B. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 81: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is unclear how TbpA is capable of binding both the holo and the apo forms of Tf (12Retzer M.D. Yu R. Zhang Y. Gonzalez G.C. Schryvers A.B. Microb. Pathog. 1998; 25: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), but it might suggest that TbpA binds both forms of Tf in an intermediate conformation. The proposal that iron removal involves separation of the two Tf domains (C1 and C2) that flank the iron-binding site (24Schryvers A.B. Stojiljkovic I. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1117-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) implies that TbpA binds to both domains. However, the only direct evidence for this is with a TbpA homologue, lactoferrin-binding protein A (25Wong H. Schryvers A.B. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Thus there are many unanswered questions regarding the role of TbpB and the process by which TbpB delivers Tf to TbpA. This study was initiated to investigate the TbpB-TbpA interaction and gain further insights into the role of TbpB in the iron acquisition process. Commercial preparations of porcine transferrin (pTf) were deglycosylated with a set of recombinant deglycosylation enzymes essentially as described previously (21Ling J.M. Shima C.H. Schriemer D.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 1301-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recombinant non-glycosylated pTf was produced by Pichia pastoris using the pPICZα A vector from Invitrogen. The mutant pTf gene with an N156D mutation to eliminate the asparagine involved in glycosylation was amplified with a forward primer containing the Kex2 site immediately preceding the amino-terminal amino acids of the mature protein. The recombinant non-glycosylated pTf was produced in P. pastoris culture supernatants with minor modifications of the methods described in the user manual (pPICZα, Invitrogen). Non-glycosylated pTf was precipitated from culture supernatants by ammonium sulfate and then purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The recombinant TbpB proteins and other anchor peptide-containing proteins and polypeptides were produced by modifications of the expression vector system used previously for production of TbpB and the N-lobe subfragment from A. pleuropneumoniae (18Moraes T.F. Yu R.H. Strynadka N.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). All of the expression constructs included a BamHI restriction site after the tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site so that the resulting proteins all had N-terminal glycine and serine residues. Thus recombinant proteins with an intact anchor peptide (2–40) had the N-terminal sequence GSSGGK (see Fig. 1), and the tagged versions had the sequence GSHHHHHHHHSGGK. The N-terminal truncations of the anchor peptide had the sequences GSFDLE (8–528), GSDLE (9–528), GSE (11–528), and so on. The untagged versions of the proteins were preceded by a polyhistidine-tagged maltose-binding protein (Mbp) and a TEV cleavage site. The tagged versions of the proteins were preceded by untagged Mbp and a TEV cleavage site. The recombinant proteins could thus be isolated by a combination of Ni-NTA chromatography, TEV cleavage, and a second round of Ni-NTA chromatography. Recombinant TbpA from A. pleuropneumoniae strain H49 was produced using modified pET-20b plasmids (Novagen) with a BamHI restriction site immediately after a pelB signal sequence, N-terminal polyhistidine tag, and TEV cleavage site. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain C41 (DE3) (26Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1546) Google Scholar), and the resulting colonies were tested for expression by solid-phase binding assays with HRP-conjugated Tf or affinity capture assays with Tf-Sepharose (27DeWinter L.M. Schryvers A.B. Pollard A.J. Maiden M.C. Meningococcal Vaccines: Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2002: 109-120Google Scholar). For large scale production, 20 ml of an overnight culture was used to inoculate 1.5 liters of Terrific Broth (Sigma) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). After 4 h, the culture was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Invitrogen) and harvested by centrifugation after a 20-h incubation. The cells were resuspended and washed with cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, pH 8.0, buffer, resuspended in one-fifth volume of buffer containing 2% (v/v) ELUGENT (Calbiochem), and mixed thoroughly for 18 h at 4 °C. The bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernatant was added to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) resin (25 ml supernatant/ml resin) and mixed overnight at 4 °C. The resin was collected in a chromatography column (Bio-Rad) and washed with 10 column volumes of buffer containing 0.25% ELUGENT and 20 mm imidazole, and the bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 250 mm imidazole. The fractions containing recombinant tagged TbpA were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.5, 100 mm NaCl buffer (containing 0.25% ELUGENT) and applied to a 20-ml Q-Sepharose column equilibrated with the same buffer. The flow-through fractions were collected, stored at 4 °C, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Non-tagged versions of recombinant TbpB and TbpA were obtained by digestion with a recombinant His-tagged TEV enzyme (10 units/mg of recombinant TbpB, 20 units/mg of recombinant TbpA) at room temperature overnight. Recombinant TbpB was digested in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8, buffer, and recombinant TbpA was digested in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m NaCl, 0.25% ELUGENT. Non-tagged TbpA obtained in the flow-through of an Ni-NTA column and non-tagged TbpB obtained from Q-Sepharose chromatography were concentrated by ultrafiltration. His-tagged versions of TbpB, TbpB derivatives, or other anchor peptide-containing polypeptides were applied to an Ni-NTA resin and incubated overnight at 4 °C (see FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6).

Excess recombinant pTf (300 μg) was either included in the initial incubation mixture or added to the resin after incubation, washing, and resuspension in buffer for a second overnight incubation. The buffer contained 200 mm NaCl and 0.25% ELUGENT and either 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 (see Fig. 4) or 10 mm HEPES, pH 8.5 (see Fig. 5). After centrifugation and washing, the resins were suspended in 1 ml of buffer containing 200 μg of recombinant, TEV-cleaved TbpB preparations and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The resin was collected by centrifugation and washed twice in buffer (containing 1 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 0.25% ELUGENT), and SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the pellets to elute bound protein (60 μl of buffer/20 μl of resin). After centrifugation, 20 μl of the supernatant was applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel for analysis. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were performed using Biacore X (GE Healthcare) at 25 °C. Porcine transferrin was coupled to the sensor chip (CM5 research grade) via standard N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N-(dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide activation. TbpA and TbpB were diluted at various concentrations with their respective mobile phase buffer (TbpA: 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% C8E4 as detergent; TbpB: 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% surfactant P20). Samples were injected as analytes at a flow rate of 20 μl/min, and bound analytes were subsequently removed by washing with the mobile phase at 300 and 240 s after the injection of TbpA or TbpB, respectively. In the case of the TbpA experiments, the TbpA regeneration buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.5% SDS) was injected prior to each analyte injection. Kinetic constants were calculated from the sensorgrams using the simulated Biacore X evaluation software, version 4.0.1 (Biacore). The TbpA data were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, and the TbpB data were fitted to a “heterogeneous ligand” binding model. The strategy for evaluating the interaction between TbpA and TbpB was to generate tagged and non-tagged versions of each of the receptor proteins and perform affinity capture experiments to evaluate the interaction. Recombinant proteins were engineered with an N-terminal polyhistidine tag to facilitate purification. A TEV protease site was included to remove the tag and provide a non-tagged variant of the protein. The inclusion of an N-terminal Mbp fusion partner had been shown to enhance cytoplasmic expression of recombinant TbpB (18Moraes T.F. Yu R.H. Strynadka N.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and was incorporated into the design of the custom expression vector for TbpBs. However, to provide a polyhistidine-tagged form of TbpB without an N-terminal Mbp fusion partner, another version of the custom expression vector was designed to incorporate a polyhistidine region after the N-terminal Mbp and TEV cleavage site. The expression vector for TbpA encoded a pelB leader peptide for export followed by the polyhistidine and TEV regions but did not encode Mbp. Preliminary analysis of expression indicated that the highest levels were achieved with TbpA from A. pleuropneumoniae, and considering the prior success with producing and crystallizing TbpBs from this species (18Moraes T.F. Yu R.H. Strynadka N.C. Schryvers A.B. Mol. Cell. 2009; 35: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 19Calmettes C. Yu R.H. Silva L.P. Curran D. Schriemer D.C.

Chem. 2011; 286: 12683-12692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we decided to focus our studies on receptor proteins from this species. To localize interaction sites with TbpA to different regions of TbpB, a variety of different derivatives of the intact TbpBs were prepared. This included a series of truncations of the N-terminal anchor peptide region (Fig. 1). For cytoplasmic expression, the N-terminal cysteine that contains covalently attached fatty acyl chains in the native protein was eliminated and replaced by a glycine and a serine residue encoded by the BamHI restriction site used for cloning. Thus these two amino acids precede all of the truncation sites. Purified forms of recombinant TbpA expressed in the outer membrane of E. coli could be obtained by directly extracting the proteins from intact cells with buffers containing the detergents Sarkosyl or ELUGENT and 1 m NaCl followed by metal chelate chromatography and anion-exchange chromatography. Sarkosyl was shown to reduce the efficiency of the affinity capture of recombinant TbpBs; thus ELUGENT was used in all the affinity capture experiments illustrated in this study. To evaluate the Tf binding properties of the recombinant proteins and determine the effect of the polyhistidine and anchor peptide regions on TbpB function, we performed surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies using immobilized pTf. Iron-loaded pTf was covalently coupled to the chips, and TbpA or TbpB with an intact anchor peptide (amino acids 2–528) or a truncated anchor peptide (amino acids 37–528) was injected at various concentrations with the mobile phase buffer. Data from the relevant sensorgrams (Fig. 2) were fitted with an appropriate binding model. The resulting affinity constants are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Rate and affinity constants for binding of pTf by TbpA and TbpBProteinkonkoffKdm−1s−1s−1ApH49 TbpB (aa 2–528)5.21 × 1057.97 × 10−315.3 ± 0.1 nmApH49 TbpB (aa 37–528)3.75 × 1056.87 × 10−318.3 ± 0.5 nmApH49 polyhisTbpB (aa 37–528)1.75 × 1057.7 × 10−344 ± 1 nmApH49 polyhisTbpA5.96 × 1047.84 × 10−60.13 ± 0.04 nm Open table in a new tab The calculated affinity constants for TbpA, −1 TbpB (amino acids 2–528), and −36 TbpB (amino acids 37–528) of 0.13, 15.3, and 18.3 nm, respectively, confirm that TbpA has a greater affinity for binding iron-loaded Tf than TbpB. The results also demonstrate that TbpB with the intact anchor peptide does not have an increased affinity for binding Tf, consistent with the expectation that the anchor peptide would not directly interact with Tf. Similarly, the inclusion of a polyhistidine region on the N terminus has minimal impact on binding of TbpB to Tf. The TbpA-Tf complex is surprisingly stable as 50% ethylene glycol or high salt (4 m NaCl) added to a non-ionic detergent (0.06% n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside) was unable to disrupt the TbpA-Tf complex. The full regeneration of the covalently coupled Tf required injection of a minimum content of 0.5% SDS (25 μl) in the mobile phase, which did not result in any loss in the binding capacity of the chip. In an attempt to emulate the in vivo situation, a polyhistidine-tagged form of TbpB was exposed to porcine Tf and then used to capture an untagged TbpA. When a form of recombinant TbpB containing a nearly complete anchor peptide (amino acids 2–528) was used, it was capable of capturing an untagged form of recombinant TbpA (Fig. 3, left panel). In contrast, when the experiment was performed with recombinant TbpB lacking the first 36 amino acids of the anchor peptide region (amino acids 37–528), little or no TbpA was captured by the preformed complex (right panel). The small amounts of TbpA and pTf observed in this figure may be due to incomplete washing. Also notable in this experiment is that the addition of untagged TbpA to the anchor peptide-deficient TbpB complexed to pTf resulted in removal of pTf from the immobilized complex (note the lower intensity of the pTf band in the +TbpA lane). This is perhaps not surprising considering that the affinity of TbpA for pTf is considerably greater than the affinity of TbpB for pTf (Fig. 2 and Table 1). To further investigate the TbpA-TbpB interaction, a reciprocal experiment was performed in which a tagged form of TbpA was tested for the ability to capture non-tagged forms of TbpB. When iron-loaded porcine Tf was mixed with the polyhistidine-tagged form of TbpA from A. pleuropneumoniae and the resulting complex was exposed to the untagged intact TbpB (amino acids 2–528), it effectively captured this form of TbpB (Fig. 4, left panel). In contrast, when the experiment was performed with recombinant TbpB containing a truncated anchor peptide (amino acids 37–528), it was not associated with the immobilized complex. When the experiment was repeated in the absence of pTf (Fig. 4, right panel), neither form of TbpB was captured by the immobilized form of TbpA. The results in Fig. 4 clearly illustrate that a truncated form of TbpB lacking nearly the entire anchor peptide region is defective in binding to TbpA. A series of N-terminal truncations of TbpB from A. pleuropneumoniae strain H49 (Fig. 1) was prepared to determine what portion of the anchor peptide region is involved in binding to TbpA. We postulated that the six amino acids after the N-terminal cysteine (SGGKGS) likely serve as a flexible arm not involved in binding to TbpA; thus the first"

https://openalex.org/W2008174469,"The production of preferred lipopolysaccharide O antigen chain lengths is important for the survival of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria in different environments, yet how Wzz proteins regulate these lengths is not well understood. The Wzz2 proteins from two different serotype O11 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains are responsible for the expression of different very long chain lengths despite high sequence homology. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to determine whether a specific amino acid was responsible for this difference in chain length; the residue present in position 321 within the second predicted coiled-coil region was able to determine which chain length was produced. A panel of site-directed mutants introducing different amino acids at this position implicated that the charge of the amino acid affected chain length, with positively charged residues associated with shorter chain lengths. Expression data also suggested this site was important for overall stability of the protein because mutants predicted to disrupt proper folding of the α helix led to lower protein levels. Cross-linking studies found that Wzz2 proteins producing shorter chain lengths had more stable higher-order oligomers. Mapping residue 321 onto the solved Escherichia coli Wzz FepE crystal structure predicted it to be located within α helix 8, which participates in intermonomeric interactions. These data further support the observation that Wzz oligomerization is necessary for chain length regulating activity but also provide evidence that differences in complex stability or changes in the conformation of the oligomer can lead to shifts in the length of the O antigen side chain."

Ligand-induced dimerization of the extracellular domains of two EGF receptors induces the activation of their intracellular kinase domains. Zhang et al. (19Zhang X. Gureasko J. Shen K. Cole P.A.

In this dimer, the C-lobe of the activator kinase interacts with the N-lobe of the receiver kinase. This results in the activation of the receiver kinase, which then phosphorylates the C-terminal tail of the activator kinase. Crystal structures of this asymmetric dimer show that residues ∼665–682 of the cytoplasmic domain, just N-terminal to the kinase domain, contribute significantly to the dimer interface. In the receiver kinase, this juxtamembrane segment forms a cradle around the C-lobe of the activator kinase (20Brewer M.R. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K. Pozzi A. Lemmon M.A. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), a structure that has been referred to as the juxtamembrane latch (18Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S.

Thus, this juxtamembrane latch appears to be crucial for activation of the kinase domain. The most membrane-proximal residues of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain (∼residues 645–665) form an α-helix in the available crystal structure (20Brewer M.R. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K.

We have previously probed the dimerization of the EGF receptor using 125I-EGF radioligand binding studies (21Adak S. DeAndrade D. Pike L.J. J. Biol.

We have shown that the binding of EGF to the dimeric form of the receptor is negatively cooperative (22Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). EGF binds with high affinity to the first site on the dimer but with substantially lower affinity to the second site on the dimer. Binding studies on nested C-terminal truncations of the EGF receptor suggested that the intracellular juxtamembrane domain, but not the kinase domain, was necessary for the maintenance of this negative cooperativity (23Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13570-13576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this report, we use site-directed mutagenesis to further examine the role of the intracellular juxtamembrane domain in the genesis of negative cooperativity in the EGF receptor. Our data suggest that interactions mediated by residues in and immediately adjacent to the membrane-proximal helical region of this domain are the main contributors to the establishment of negative cooperativity in the EGF receptor. They suggest a model of EGF receptor kinase activation in which the binding of EGF to the first subunit of the receptor dimer leads to the formation of an asymmetric dimer and the activation of the first kinase domain. This involves stabilizing interactions mediated by both the juxtamembrane latch and the juxtamembrane clasp. Ligand binding to the second site disrupts the juxtamembrane clasp, allowing the formation of the reciprocal asymmetric dimer and activation of the second kinase domain. Because a fraction of the energy derived from ligand binding to the second site on the dimer is used to reorient the asymmetric dimer, binding affinity is reduced compared with the first site on the dimer, giving rise to the observed negative cooperativity. The EGF receptor mutants (R656G,R657G-EGFR, E661A,E663A,E666A-EGFR, T654A-EGFR, T669A-EGFR, and T669D,S671D-EGFR) were generated in the pcDNA5/FRT vector using QuikChange mutagenesis. Once the mutations were confirmed by sequencing, the EGF receptor was transferred to the pBI-Tet vector using the NheI and EcoRV sites. The V665M-EGF receptor and the Δ648–662-EGF receptor were the generous gift of Dr. Graham Carpenter (Vanderbilt University) and were moved into the pBI-Tet vector. The EGF receptor mutants in the pBI-Tet vector were cotransfected with pTK-Hyg (Clontech) into Tet-on CHO-K1 cells (Clontech) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable clones were selected by growth in 500 μg/ml hygromycin. The T669D, T669E, and T669R point mutations were generated in pcDNA 3.1 and moved into pcDNA5/FRT. The constructs were transfected into Flp-in CHO cells (Invitrogen), and stable lines were selected by growth in 500 μg/ml ZeocinTM (Invitrogen). EGF was purchased from Biomedical Technologies (Stoughton, MA). 125I-EGF was synthesized using the ICl method of Doran and Spar (24Doran D.M. Spar I.L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 39: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cells were plated into 6-well dishes 48 h prior to assay and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetalplex (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), penicillin/streptomycin, and the desired concentration of doxycycline. For assay, the cells were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Ham's F-12 medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 40 pm 125I-EGF, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled EGF. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the monolayers were dissolved in 1 m NaOH and counted in a Beckman gamma counter. All of the assays were done in triplicate. The data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 as described previously (22Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined by fitting the data to the Prism equation for competition binding and was subtracted from all data points. Data from all the binding isotherms from a single mutant were globally fit to the following equation, Y¯=K11[EGF]+L20[R]K21[EGF][(1+2K22EGF])](1+K11[EGF])+2L20[R][1+K21[EGF](1+K22[EGF])](Eq. 1) where Ȳ= is the fractional saturation of receptor with ligand, and [R] is the concentration of unoccupied EGF receptors (25Wong I. Lohman T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 95-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This can be calculated from the following equation, R0=[R](1+K11[EGF])+2L20[R]2(1+K21[EGF]+K21K22[EGF]2)(Eq. 2) where R0 = total concentration of EGF receptors as derived by Wyman and Gill (26Wyman J. Gill S.J. Binding and Linkage: Functional Chemistry of Biological Macromolecules. University Science Books, Mill Valley, CA1990Google Scholar). The cells were plated into 6-well dishes 48 h prior to use and grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% Fetalplex and penicillin/streptomycin. For assay, the cells were transferred to Ham's F-12 medium containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and incubated at 37 °C. The indicated concentration of EGF was then added for 5 min. At the end of the incubation, the medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Radioimmune precipitation assay buffer was added to each well, and lysates were prepared and centrifuged. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride. After blocking with powdered milk, the membranes were probed with antibodies to phosphotyrosine (BD Biosciences), phospho-Thr-654 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), phospho-Thr-669 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or the EGF receptor (Cell Signaling Technology). Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence. For binding assays, the cells were chilled to 4 °C and treated with 100 nm PMA 3The abbreviation used is: PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. (Sigma) for 30 min prior to switching the cells to standard binding medium containing 125I-EGF and 100 nm PMA in a final concentration of 0.01% Me2SO. Controls contained 0.01% Me2SO.

EGF exhibits a heterogeneous binding affinity for its receptor as evidenced by curvilinear Scatchard plots (27King A.C. Cuatrecasas P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3053-3060Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Magun B.E. Matrisian L.M. Bowden G.T. J. Biol.

By carrying out 125I-EGF radioligand binding assays in cells expressing increasing levels of EGF receptors, we have shown that this heterogeneity is due to the existence of negative cooperativity in EGF receptor dimers (22Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A shows our model for the binding of EGF in a dimerizing system. In this model, there is a pre-existing equilibrium between unoccupied monomers and unoccupied dimers. EGF can thus bind to three different states of the receptor: the monomer, the first site on the dimer, or the second site on the dimer. The position of the monomer-dimer equilibrium is dependent on the number of EGF receptors expressed in a cell. At low levels of receptor, the monomeric form will be favored, whereas at high levels of receptor expression, the dimer will be favored. As a result, if the affinity of EGF for the monomer is different from its affinity for the dimer, then the position of the saturation binding isotherm for EGF will shift as the concentration of cell surface receptors increases. An example of this is shown in Fig. 1B for the binding of 125I-EGF to CHO cells expressing wild type EGF receptors. As can be seen from the figure, the saturation binding isotherms shift from left to right with increasing levels of EGF receptor expression. Global modeling of all the binding curves to the equation describing binding in this dimerizing system (see “Experimental Procedures”) yields fitted values for the equilibrium association constants. As can be seen from the values reported in the inset in Fig. 1B, EGF binds with higher affinity to the first site on the dimer (K21 = 1.5 × 109, corresponding to a KD of 660 pm) than to the second site on the dimer (K22 = 3 × 108, corresponding to a KD of 3.3 nm). This is classic negative cooperativity. We have previously shown that the intracellular juxtamembrane domain is required for negative cooperativity (23Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13570-13576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This part of the EGF receptor has been roughly divided into two regions termed JM-A, which includes residues 645–664, and JM-B, which includes residues 665–682 (18Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K.

In the crystal structure of the asymmetric dimer (20Brewer M.R. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K. Pozzi A. Lemmon M.A. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the JM-A segment appears as a helix oriented away from the kinase domains (Fig. 2A). However, NMR studies and mutational analyses suggest that this region may form an anti-parallel helical dimer that functions as a clasp to stabilize the asymmetric dimer (18Jura N. Endres N.F.

To assess the contribution of the JM-A domain to negative cooperativity in the EGF receptor, we made an internal deletion of this region (Δ648–662) as well as several point mutations as outlined in Fig. 2B. The effect of these mutations on the kinase and binding activity of the EGF receptor is shown in Fig. 3.FIGURE 3Kinase and 125I-EGF binding in JM-A domain mutants. A, autophosphorylation of wild type, Δ648–662-EGFR, E661,663,666A-EGFR, and R656,657G-EGFR. CHO cells expressing the indicated mutant were incubated with the indicated concentration of EGF for 5 min. Receptor autophosphorylation was determined following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine (pTyr) and the EGF receptor. B–D, 125I-EGF binding to CHO cells expressing Δ648–662-EGF receptor (B), E661,663,666A-EGF receptor (C), or the R656,657G-EGF receptor (D). Binding studies and data analysis were done as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The fitted parameters are given in the insets.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As reported previously (31Thiel K.W. Carpenter G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 19238-19243Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), deletion of essentially the entire JM-A domain, residues 648–662, resulted in the complete loss of EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 3A). The effect of this mutation on ligand binding was similarly stark (Fig. 3B). Despite a greater than 100-fold change in the level of Δ648–662-EGF receptor expression, the binding isotherms did not change position and were best fit to the equation for binding to a single class of sites. This result indicates that deletion of the JM-A region abrogates negative cooperativity in the EGF receptor. In the proposed JM-A anti-parallel helical dimer (18Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), a number of salt bridges between acidic and basic residues can form that would stabilize this helical clasp. To determine whether such interactions might play a role in negative cooperativity in the EGF receptor, a triple point mutant was generated that replaced all three glutamic acid residues in this region with alanines. This mutant is the E661A, E663A, E666A-EGF receptor. The E661A,E663A,E666A-EGF receptor was expressed in CHO cells and assayed for receptor autophosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 3A, EGF-stimulated receptor autophosphorylation was severely compromised in this mutant. The level of receptor phosphorylation was only ∼20% of that observed in the wild type receptor. The E661A,E663A,E666A-EGF receptor also showed major changes in its ligand binding properties (Fig. 3C). Although the saturation binding isotherms shifted with increasing levels of receptor expression, the shift was from right to left, the opposite direction from that seen for the wild type receptor. Global fitting of the binding curves yielded fitted values for the equilibrium constants showing that the affinity of EGF for the second site on the dimer was increased compared with the wild type receptor, and in fact, K22 was slightly greater than K21 in this receptor mutant. Thus, this triple point mutation abolishes negative cooperativity in the EGF receptor, making it easier for EGF to bind to the second site on the dimer. The binding isotherms for the E661A,E663A,E666A-EGF receptor shift from right to left because of the continued presence of a limited amount of positive linkage in this mutant. Positive linkage refers to the situation in which the affinity for the dimeric form is higher than the affinity for the monomeric form. Under these conditions, the binding of ligand induces the assembly of receptor dimers. We have previously shown that the kinase-dead, K721A-EGF receptor exhibits positive linkage and, correspondingly, a shift of its binding isotherms from right to left with increasing receptor levels (23Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13570-13576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Positive linkage is almost certainly present in the wild type receptor but is masked by changes in receptor affinity caused by phosphorylation of the receptor (23Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13570-13576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The kinase-dead K721A-EGF receptor and the highly kinase-impaired L680N-EGF receptor both retain negative cooperativity in ligand binding (22Macdonald J.L. Pike L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 112-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 23Macdonald-Obermann J.L. Pike L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 13570-13576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, the decreased kinase activity observed in the Δ648–662- and E661A,E663A,E666A-EGF receptors is not responsible for their loss of negative cooperativity. Jura et al. (18Jura N. Endres N.F. Engel K. Deindl S. Das R. Lamers M.H. Wemmer D.E. Zhang X. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2009; 137: 1293-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) reported that a mutation in the JM-A domain, R656G,R657G, led to a significant loss in EGF-stimulated kinase activity. They speculated that this was due to the weakening of the juxtamembrane helix and hence the helical dimer that helps to stabilize the asymmetric dimer. As shown in Fig. 3A, receptor autophosphorylation was only slightly reduced in this mutant, reaching approximately two-thirds of the level of phosphorylation seen in the wild type receptor. Consistent with this limited change in kinase activity, the R656G,R657G-EGF receptor showed only modest differences from the wild type receptor in terms of ligand binding properties (Fig. 3D). The EGF binding isotherms shifted from left to right as the level of EGF receptor expression increased from 15,000 receptors/cell to ∼1 million receptors/cell. The fitted parameters for all four equilibrium constants were fairly similar to those observed in cells expressing wild type receptors: in particular, K21 > K22, indicating the continued presence of negative cooperativity in this mutant. Thus, this mutation led to only modest effects on binding and kinase activity, suggesting that these residues play a relatively minor role in determining negative cooperativity. Brewer et al. (20Brewer M.R. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K. Pozzi A. Lemmon M.A. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) recently showed that the V665M mutation of the EGF receptor, at the junction of JM-A and JM-B domains, led to ligand-independent phosphorylation of the EGF receptor and enhanced its transforming activity. Based on the crystal structure of the asymmetric kinase dimer, they proposed that this mutation stabilized the asymmetric dimer because the larger side chain of methionine packed more effectively into a hydrophobic pocket on the C-lobe of the activator kinase than did the smaller side chain of valine. To determine the effect of stabilization of the asymmetric dimer on EGF binding, the V665M-EGF receptor was expressed in CHO cells, and analyses of its kinase and radioligand binding properties were performed. The results are shown in Fig. 4. As observed by Brewer et al. (20Brewer M.R. Choi S.H. Alvarado D. Moravcevic K. Pozzi A. Lemmon M.A. Carpenter G. Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 641-651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), the V665M mutation resulted in significant ligand-independent kinase activity of the EGF receptor that was further enhanced by the addition of EGF (Fig. 4A). In 125I-EGF binding experiments (Fig. 4B), the saturation binding isotherms showed the expected shift from left to right with increasing levels of EGF receptor. However, global fitting of the data from all of the curves revealed that there was a striking decrease of ∼2 orders of magnitude in the value of K22. Thus, stabilizing the asymmetric dimer with this mutation enhances negative cooperativity, making it more difficult for EGF to bind to the second site on the dimer. Thr-654 in the JM-A segment is the site of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor by protein kinase C (32Hunter T. Ling N. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1984; 311: 480-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The activity of protein kinase C can be stimulated by treatment of cells with PMA (33Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5A shows the effect of PMA pretreatment on the binding and kinase activity of cells expressing the wild type EGF receptor. In untreated cells, the 125I-EGF binding isotherm exhibited 50% saturation at ∼0.9 nm EGF. After pretreatment with PMA, the binding curve was significantly shifted to the right (p < 0.001), with 50% saturation occurring at ∼1.5 nm EGF. As shown in the inset of the figure, under normal conditions, the EGF receptor is not phosphorylated on Thr-654. However, treatment of the cells with PMA led to the constitutive phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at this site. This phosphorylation was associated with a significant decrease in the ability of EGF to stimulate the autophosphorylation of its receptor but no change in EGF receptor levels. Thus, as has been reported previously, phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on Thr-654 results in a decrease in ligand binding affinit"

Mouse splenic cDC subtypes, including CD8α(+) and CD8α(-) cDC, are not identical in their Ag presenting and T cell priming functions. Surprisingly, few studies have reported functional differences between CD4(-) and CD4(+) CD8α(-) cDC subsets. We show that, when loaded in vitro with OVA peptide or whole protein, and in steady-state conditions, splenic CD4(-) and CD4(+) cDC are equivalent in their capacity to prime and direct CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell differentiation. In contrast, in response to α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), CD4(-) and CD4(+) cDC differentially activate invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells, a population of lipid-reactive non-conventional T lymphocytes. Both cDC subsets equally take up α-GalCer in vitro and in vivo to stimulate the iNKT hybridoma DN32.D3, the activation of which depends solely on TCR triggering. On the other hand, and relative to their CD4(+) counterparts, CD4(-) cDC more efficiently stimulate primary iNKT cells, a phenomenon likely due to differential production of co-factors (including IL-12) by cDC. Our data reveal a novel functional difference between splenic CD4(+) and CD4(-) cDC subsets that may be important in immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W2022816153,"Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy patients often develop a cardiomyopathy for which the pathogenesis is still unknown. We have employed the murine animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (mdx), which develops a cardiomyopathy that includes some characteristics of the human disease, to study the molecular basis of this pathology. Here we show that the mdx mouse heart has defects consistent with alteration in compounds that regulate energy homeostasis including a marked decrease in creatine-phosphate (PC). In addition, the mdx heart is more susceptible to anoxia than controls. Since the cardio-protective ATP sensitive potassium channel (KATP) complex and PC have been shown to interact we investigated whether deficits in PC levels correlate with other molecular events including KATP ion channel complex presence, its functionality and interaction with dystrophin. We found that this channel complex is present in the dystrophic cardiac cell membrane but its ability to sense a drop in the intracellular ATP concentration and consequently open is compromised by the absence of dystrophin. We further demonstrate that the creatine kinase muscle isoform (CKm) is displaced from the plasma membrane of the mdx cardiac cells. Considering that CKm is a determinant of KATP channel complex function we hypothesize that dystrophin acts as a scaffolding protein organizing the KATP channel complex and the enzymes necessary for its correct functioning. Therefore, the lack of proper functioning of the cardio-protective KATP system in the mdx cardiomyocytes may be part of the mechanism contributing to development of cardiac disease in dystrophic patients."

Infected patients were treated with BZ and followed-up. Blood samples collected at diagnosis-T0, end of treatment-T1, and six months later-T2 were analysed by ELISA for detection of Anti-M2R AAbs and circulating levels of IFN-γ.At T0, anti-M2R AAbs were demonstrated in 56.7% of T. cruzi-infected patients, whereas uninfected controls were 100% negative. The average age of Anti-M2R AAbs(+) patients was higher than that from negative population. Infected children also displayed significantly stronger serum IFN-γ responses than controls. Upon BZ treatment, a significant linear decreasing trend in Anti-M2R AAb reactivity was recorded throughout the follow-up, with 29.7-88.1% decrease at T2. IFN-γ circulating levels also declined by T2.Anti-M2R AAbs and IFN-γ raise early during chagasic infection in children and are downmodulated by BZ therapy. These findings reinforce the usefulness of early BZ treatment not only to eliminate the parasite but also to reduce potentially pathogenic immune responses."

Here, we performed the first genome-wide search for genes influencing hippocampal oscillations. We measured local field potentials (LFPs) using 64-channel multi-electrode arrays in acute hippocampal slices of 29 BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains. Spontaneous activity and carbachol-induced fast network oscillations were analyzed with spectral and cross-correlation methods and the resulting traits were used for mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs), i.e., regions on the genome that may influence hippocampal function. Using genome-wide hippocampal gene expression data, we narrowed the QTLs to eight candidate genes, including Plcb1, a phospholipase that is known to influence hippocampal oscillations. We also identified two genes coding for calcium channels, Cacna1b and Cacna1e, which mediate presynaptic transmitter release and have not been shown to regulate hippocampal network activity previously. Furthermore, we showed that the amplitude of the hippocampal oscillations is genetically correlated with hippocampal volume and several measures of novel environment exploration."
https://openalex.org/W2063434099,"Many carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their metabolites can bind covalently to DNA. Carcinogen-DNA adducts may lead to mutations in critical genes, eventually leading to cancer. In this study we report that fish oil (FO) blocks the formation of DNA adducts by detoxification of PAHs. B6C3F1 male mice were fed a FO or corn oil (CO) diet for 30 days. The animals were then treated with seven carcinogenic PAHs including benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) with one of two doses via a single intraperitoneal injection. Animals were terminated at 1, 3, or 7 d after treatment. The levels of DNA adducts were analyzed by the 32P-postlabeling assay. Our results showed that the levels of total hepatic DNA adducts were significantly decreased in FO groups compared to CO groups with an exception of low PAH dose at 3 d (P = 0.067). Total adduct levels in the high dose PAH groups were 41.36±6.48 (Mean±SEM) and 78.72±8.03 in 109 nucleotides (P = 0.011), respectively, for the FO and CO groups at 7 d. Animals treated with the low dose (2.5 fold lower) PAHs displayed similar trends. Total adduct levels were 12.21±2.33 in the FO group and 24.07±1.99 in the CO group, P = 0.008. BPDE-dG adduct values at 7 d after treatment of high dose PAHs were 32.34±1.94 (CO group) and 21.82±3.37 (FO group) in 109 nucleotides with P value being 0.035. Low dose groups showed similar trends for BPDE-dG adduct in the two diet groups. FO significantly enhanced gene expression of Cyp1a1 in both the high and low dose PAH groups. Gstt1 at low dose of PAHs showed high levels in FO compared to CO groups with P values being 0.014. Histological observations indicated that FO played a hepatoprotective role during the early stages. Our results suggest that FO has a potential to be developed as a cancer chemopreventive agent."
https://openalex.org/W2163297261,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the Western world. In advanced AMD, new vessels from choriocapillaris (CC) invade through the Bruch's membrane (BrM) into the retina, forming choroidal neovascularization (CNV). BrM, an elastic lamina that is located between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and CC, is thought to act as a physical and functional barrier against CNV. The BrM of patients with early AMD are characterized by decreased levels of antiangiogenic factors, including endostatin, thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), as well as by degeneration of the elastic layer. Motivated by a previous report that heat increases elastin expression in human skin, we examined the effect of heat on human ARPE-19 cell production of BrM components. Heat treatment stimulated the production of BrM components, including TSP-1, PEDF, and tropoelastin in vitro and increased the antiangiogenic activity of RPE measured in a mouse corneal pocket assay. The effect of heat on experimental CNV was investigated by pretreating the retina with heat via infrared diode laser prior to the induction of CNV. Heat treatment blocked the development of experimental CNV in vivo. These findings suggest that heat treatment may restore BrM integrity and barrier function against new vessel growth."

Patients were classified as either responders or non-responders to therapy with IVIg based on clinical data and the two groups were compared.From a total cohort of 42 patients (30 males, 12 females, aged 18-83 years), 31 patients responded to IVIg and 11 did not. Compared to patients that developed progressive neurological decline, responders were typically younger (45.8 compared to 56.0 years, P<0.05) and had upper limb (83.9% compared to 63.6%, NS), unilateral (80.6% compared to 45.5%, P<0.05), and isolated distal (54.1% compared to 9.1%, P<0.05) weakness. Patients with predominantly upper limb, asymmetrical, and distal weakness were more likely to respond to IVIg therapy. Of the patients who responded to treatment, only 12.9% had detectable GM(1) antibodies and conduction block (not fulfilling diagnostic criteria) was only identified in 22.6%.More than 70% of patients with pure LMN syndromes from the present series responded to treatment with IVIg therapy, despite a low prevalence of detectable GM(1) antibodies and conduction block. Patients with isolated LMN presentations, not fulfilling accepted diagnostic criteria, may respond to IVIg therapy, irrespective of the presence of conduction block or GM(1) antibodies, and should be given an empirical trial of IVIg to determine treatment responsiveness."

Attention provides the perceptual selectivity necessary to filter an overwhelming input of sensory information to allow for efficient object detection. Although much research has examined visual search and the ‘template’ of attentional set that allows for target detection, the behavior of individual subjects often reveals the limits of experimental control of attention. Few studies have examined important aspects such as individual differences and metacognitive strategies. The present study analyzes the data from two visual search experiments for a conjunctively defined target (Proulx, 2007). The data revealed attentional capture blindness, individual differences in search strategies, and a significant rate of metacognitive errors for the assessment of the strategies employed. These results highlight a challenge for visual attention studies to account for individual differences in search behavior and distractibility, and participants that do not (or are unable to) follow instructions."
https://openalex.org/W2007262212,"Behavioral responses of an animal vary even when they are elicited by the same stimulus. This variability is due to stochastic processes within the nervous system and to the changing internal states of the animal. To what extent does the variability of neuronal responses account for the overall variability at the behavioral level? To address this question we evaluate the neuronal variability at the output stage of the blowfly's (Calliphora vicina) visual system by recording from motion-sensitive interneurons mediating head optomotor responses. By means of a simple modelling approach representing the sensory-motor transformation, we predict head movements on the basis of the recorded responses of motion-sensitive neurons and compare the variability of the predicted head movements with that of the observed ones. Large gain changes of optomotor head movements have previously been shown to go along with changes in the animals' activity state. Our modelling approach substantiates that these gain changes are imposed downstream of the motion-sensitive neurons of the visual system. Moreover, since predicted head movements are clearly more reliable than those actually observed, we conclude that substantial variability is introduced downstream of the visual system."

https://openalex.org/W2048409469,"Variability is a hallmark of microbial systems. On the one hand, microbes are subject to environmental heterogeneity and undergo changeable conditions in their immediate surroundings. On the other hand, microbial populations exhibit high cellular diversity. The relation between microbial diversity and variability of population dynamics is difficult to assess. This connection can be quantitatively studied from a perspective that combines in silico models and thermodynamic methods and interpretations. The infection process of Plasmodium falciparum parasitizing human red blood cells under laboratory cultivation conditions is used to illustrate the potential of Individual-based models in the context of predictive microbiology and parasitology. Experimental data from several in vitro cultures are compared to the outcome of an individual-based model and analysed from a thermodynamic perspective. This approach allows distinguishing between intrinsic and external constraints that give rise to the diversity in the infection forms, and it provides a criterion to quantitatively define transient and stationary regimes in the culture. Increasing the ability of models to discriminate between different states of microbial populations enhances their predictive capability which finally leads to a better the control over culture systems. The strategy here presented is of general application and it can substantially improve modelling of other types of microbial communities."
https://openalex.org/W2061527625,"Computational neuroscientists frequently encounter the challenge of parameter fitting--exploring a usually high dimensional variable space to find a parameter set that reproduces an experimental data set. One common approach is using automated search algorithms such as gradient descent or genetic algorithms. However, these approaches suffer several shortcomings related to their lack of understanding the underlying question, such as defining a suitable error function or getting stuck in local minima. Another widespread approach is manual parameter fitting using a keyboard or a mouse, evaluating different parameter sets following the users intuition. However, this process is often cumbersome and time-intensive. Here, we present a new method for manual parameter fitting. A MIDI controller provides input to the simulation software, where model parameters are then tuned according to the knob and slider positions on the device. The model is immediately updated on every parameter change, continuously plotting the latest results. Given reasonably short simulation times of less than one second, we find this method to be highly efficient in quickly determining good parameter sets. Our approach bears a close resemblance to tuning the sound of an analog synthesizer, giving the user a very good intuition of the problem at hand, such as immediate feedback if and how results are affected by specific parameter changes. In addition to be used in research, our approach should be an ideal teaching tool, allowing students to interactively explore complex models such as Hodgkin-Huxley or dynamical systems."
