https://openalex.org/W1556409059,"We have identified two additional members of the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-related gene family. cDNA clones for one new gene, designated alpha 5, were isolated from rat hippocampus and rat PC12 cell line cDNA libraries. The alpha 5 gene encodes a protein of 48,800 daltons (424 amino acids) which exhibits significant overall amino acid sequence identity with the previously cloned rat nAChR subunits alpha 1 (49%), alpha 2 (55%), alpha 3 (52%), and alpha 4 (49%). Features characteristic of other nAChR alpha-subunits are present such as conserved cysteine residues at positions 127, 141, 191, and 192, and four strongly hydrophobic domains. A second addition to the nAChR-related gene family, designated beta 4, is encoded in overlapping rat genomic clones lambda DD15 and lambda RG518A. The beta 4 gene, encoding a mature protein of 53,300 daltons (475 amino acids), consists of 6 exons and has a transcription unit length of approximately 18 kilobase pairs. The beta 4 gene encoded protein shows considerable amino acid sequence identity with nAChR beta 1 (43%), beta 2 (64%), and beta 3 (44%) subunits. Northern blots showed that, along with alpha 3 and beta 2, transcripts for both the alpha 5 and beta 4 genes are present in the PC12 cell line, while in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated expression of the alpha 5 and beta 4 genes in a small number of nuclei in the central nervous system. Finally, the genes that encode the beta 4, alpha 3, and alpha 5 proteins are transcribed with convergent polarities and form a tightly linked gene cluster spanning approximately 60 kilobase pairs."
https://openalex.org/W2072523212,"Upon microinjection into the cytoplasm, three small nonnuclear (extracellular or mitochondrial) proteins diffused into nuclei of chilled or energy-depleted cells. In contrast, the facilitated transport of two large nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing proteins was reversibly arrested by chilling or energy depletion. Surprisingly, the transport of two small nucleophilic proteins, histone H1 and P(Lys)-cytochrome c (cytochrome c cross-linked with synthetic peptide NLSs), was also arrested by either chilling or energy depletion. In situ titration studies indicate that the transport arrest of H1 in chilled cells is mediated by a cytoplasmic receptor. Therefore, even though they are potentially able to diffuse into nuclei, histones and other small NLS-containing proteins are localized by a receptor-mediated process that precludes their diffusion through the nuclear pores."
https://openalex.org/W1997197588,"In several neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease, abnormal accumulations of cytoskeleton-associated proteins manifest as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in vulnerable brain regions. Antibodies recognizing tau (5E2 and Alz-50) and ubiquitin epitopes in NFTs were used to examine the influence of glutamate and Ca2+ influx on antigen expression in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Glutamate caused the degeneration of a subpopulation of pyramidal neurons, which exhibited increased immunostaining with all three antibodies. Subtoxic levels of glutamate also increased 5E2 and Alz-50 antigen levels in a subpopulation of neurons, particularly in the distal regions of the axons. Both glutamate-induced degeneration and increases in tau and ubiquitin immunostaining were prevented by removal of extracellular Ca2+. Increased immunostaining was also induced by Ca2+ ionophore A23187 or elevated levels of extracellular K+. The antigenic changes occurred within 1 hr of exposure to glutamate or A23187 and were not prevented by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. These data indicate that Ca2+ influx caused by glutamate can lead to modifications of extant proteins similar to those seen in NFTs."
https://openalex.org/W2042437053,"The binding site for an open-channel blocker, QX-222, at mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was probed using site-directed mutagenesis, oocyte expression, and electrophysiological analysis. The proposed cytoplasmic end of the M2 transmembrane helix is termed position 1'. At position 10' (alpha S252, beta T263, gamma A261, delta A266), Ala residues yield stronger and longer binding of QX-222 than Ser or Thr residues. These effects are opposite and roughly equal (30%-50% per mutation) to previously reported effects at position 6'. The polar end of an anesthetic molecule seems to bind to the position 6' OH groups, which provide a water-like region; the nonpolar moiety is near position 10' and binds more strongly in a nonpolar environment. Interactions with adjacent OH-rich turns of an amphiphilic helix may explain the widespread blocking effects of local anesthetics at the conduction pore of ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W1991143182,"The gene encoding the yeast mitochondrial outer membrane channel VDAC was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to change amino acids at 29 positions to residues differing in charge from the wild-type sequence. The mutant genes were then expressed in yeast, and the physiological consequences of single and multiple amino acid changes were assessed after isolation and insertion of mutant channels into phospholipid bilayers. Selectivity changes were observed at 14 sites distributed throughout the length of the molecule. These sites are likely to define the position of the protein walls lining the aqueous pore and hence, the transmembrane segments. These results have been used to develop a model of the open state of the channel in which each polypeptide contributes 12 beta strands and one alpha helix to form the aqueous transmembrane pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2085880342,"Protein zero (P0), an integral membrane glycoprotein synthesized by Schwann cells, is the major glycoprotein of peripheral nerve myelin. The predicted disposition of P0 with respect to the membrane bilayer postulates the existence of extracellular and intracellular domains, that mediate compaction of the myelin lamellae. We used in vitro translations programmed with sciatic nerve mRNA and cells transfected with a P0 cDNA construct to study the biosynthesis and topology of P0 in the bilayer. The behavior of P0 at the cell surface, when expressed under physiological conditions, was also examined. We have verified the topological predictions of an earlier model, derived from analysis of a P0 cDNA, and provide evidence that the extracellular domain of P0 mediates homotypically cell-cell interactions in the transfectants."
https://openalex.org/W2060188519,"Neurons from the embryonic brain of Xenopus were transfected in vivo with a vector expressing luciferase cDNA using a simple lipofection procedure. Luciferase activity was monitored quantitatively, and the protein was immunolocalized in whole-mount embryonic brains. Luciferase-expressing neurons were often intensely labeled, displaying a Golgi-like filling of their dendrites, axons, and growth cones. Luciferase expression could be targeted to the retina by simply removing the skin epidermis covering the area and exposing the whole embryo to the DNA-lipofectin mixture. Luciferase activity in transfected embryos rose to peak values during the first 48 hr posttransfection and was still detectable 28 days later. Cotransfection experiments in which embryonic nervous tissue was exposed simultaneously to two different genes, luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase, showed that transfected cells coexpressed the two genes at an extremely high frequency (85%-100%). This offers the possibility of targeting functionally significant genes along with benign reporter genes in the developing CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2052316171,"The E74 gene occupies one of the early puff loci (74EF) central to the Ashburner model for the ecdysone-induced puffing pattern in Drosophila. In support of this model, we show that the E74A promoter is directly activated by ecdysone and is subsequently repressed by ecdysone-induced proteins. Further support derives from the correspondence observed between 74EF puff size and the accumulation of nascent transcripts on the E74A unit. These transcripts elongate at 1.1 kb/min so that this 60 kb unit acts as a timer, delaying the appearance of its mRNA by 1 hr. E74A transcription is induced in a variety of ecdysone target tissues in late third instar larvae and during each of the ecdysone pulses that mark the six stages of Drosophila development. These results support an extension of the Ashburner model in which ecdysone pulses coordinate tissue development. The temporal pattern of E74B transcription overlaps but is distinct from that of E74A."
https://openalex.org/W1594121967,"We describe a novel integrin heterodimer on the surface of the human embryonic kidney cell line 293. This receptor is comprised of alpha v and beta 1 subunits, each of which has been previously found in association with other integrin subunits. This alpha v.beta 1 complex was identified as the predominant vitronectin receptor (VnR) on the surface of 293 cells by immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against the alpha v subunit. Polymerase chain reaction analysis detected mRNAs for alpha v and beta 1 subunits while no evidence was obtained for beta 2, beta 3, or alpha IIb integrin subunit mRNA. Immunoprecipitation of surface-iodinated proteins with antibodies to alpha v gave bands of 150 and 120 kDa. The 120-kDa band reacted with antibodies to beta 1 in immunoblotting experiments. 293 cells adhere to vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, and collagen IV, while von Willebrand factor and fibrinogen, known ligands of the VnR (alpha v.beta 3), did not support adhesion. A polyclonal antibody directed against both subunits of the VnR (alpha v, beta 3) inhibits attachment of 293 cells to vitronectin but not to other adhesive proteins. A beta 1-specific monoclonal inhibited attachment to fibronectin, laminin, and collagen IV, known ligands of beta 1 integrins, as well as vitronectin. This novel (alpha v. beta 1) VnR thus appears to mediate cell adhesion exclusively to vitronectin, in contrast to previously described VnRs which have multiple ligands."

https://openalex.org/W2030904938,"The relationship between expression of the pituitary-specific transcription factor, GHF-1, and activation of the growth hormone and prolactin genes during mouse anterior pituitary development was investigated. While GHF-1 transcripts were detected within 24 hr of the first observable events in anterior pituitary differentiation, no GHF-1 protein could be detected until about 3 days later. The appearance of GHF-1 protein showed good temporal and spatial correlation with activation of the growth hormone gene. Prolactin gene expression, on the other hand, was observed transiently during embryonic day 16 in two different populations of cells, of which the major one does not contain GHF-1 or growth hormone. These results suggest that expression of GHF-1 is controlled both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. The spatial and temporal correlation between the appearance of GHF-1 protein and growth hormone gene activation suggests that GHF-1 is responsible for this very last step in the specialization of somatotrophic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1800167367,"In BC3H-1 cells, a model for studying the events that occur when myoblasts transform into myocytes, we observed that differentiation was associated with a 10-20-fold increase in both gene transcription and mRNA levels for myogenin, a member of the myc gene family. In contrast, the expression of the related protein MyoD1 was not influenced. This enhanced expression of myogenin was followed by morphological differentiation and increased expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a muscle-specific gene product. Exposure of BC3H-1 cells to a 20-base myogenin antisense oligomer blocked morphological differentiation and resulted in nearly complete inhibition of acetylcholine receptor protein expression. To further study the relationship between muscle cell differentiation and myogenin gene expression, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), a known inhibitor of myogenic differentiation, was employed. FGF treatment inhibited myogenin gene transcription and BC3H-1 cell differentiation. These results demonstrate therefore that myogenin is an important regulator of skeletal muscle cell differentiation, and the expression of myogenin is under the control of FGF."
https://openalex.org/W1544601757,"A new hepatapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) analog, JMV-180 (Boc-Tyr(SO3-)-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-2-phenylethylester), acts as an agonist at high affinity CCK receptors on rat pancreatic acini to stimulate amylase release but unlike cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK8) does not act on low affinity CCK receptors to inhibit amylase release (Galas, M. D., Lignon, M. F., Rodriguez, M., Mendre, C., Fulcrand, P., Laur, J., and Martinez, J. (1988) Am. J. Physiol. 254, G176-G188). To investigate the biochemical mechanisms initiated by CCK acting on each class of CCK receptor, the effects of JMV-180 and CCK8 on amylase release, Ca2+ mobilization, and phospholipid hydrolysis were studied in isolated rat pancreatic acini. When acini were loaded with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, amylase release stimulated by both JMV-180 and CCK8 was reduced. Measurement of 45Ca2+ efflux and cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) by the fluorescence of fura-2-loaded acini in a stirred cuvette showed that JMV-180 induced a concentration-dependent increase but with a maximal response only two-thirds that induced by CCK8. When [Ca2+]i of individual fura-2-loaded acinar cells was measured by microspectrofluorometry, all concentrations of JMV-180 (1 nM-10 microM) induced repetitive transient [Ca2+]i spikes (Ca2+ oscillations). By contrast, stimulation with a high concentration of CCK8 (1 nM) caused a large increase in [CA2+]i followed by a small sustained elevation of [Ca2+]i. The measurement of inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production by both [3H]inositol labeling and 1,4,5-IP3 radioreceptor assay showed that JMV-180 had only minimal effects at 10 microM in contrast to the large increase induced by high concentrations of CCK8 (more than 1 nM). JMV-180 blocked the effect of a high concentration of CCK8 on both [Ca2+]i and 1,4,5-IP3 productions but did not affect the response to carbamylcholine. JMV-180 caused a delayed monophasic stimulation of 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) sustained to 60 min without the early increase in DAG observed in response to CCK8. Furthermore, JMV-180 stimulated the release of [3H]choline metabolites, primarily phosphorylated choline, from [3H]choline-labeled acini at low concentrations and to the same extent as CCK8. Since JMV-180 interacts not only with high affinity CCK receptors as an agonist but also with low affinity CCK receptors as a functional antagonist, the present results indicate that the occupancy of high affinity state receptors by CCK induces Ca2+ oscillations, DAG formation from phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis, and amylase release with minimal phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1969577392,"Cultures of rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons were used to examine the roles of excitatory synaptic transmission, NMDA receptors, and elevated [Ca2+]i in the production of excitotoxicity. In ∼70% of the cells observed, perfusion with Mg2+-free, glycine-supplemented medium induced large spontaneous fluctuations or maintained plateaus of [Ca2+]i. [Ca2+]i fluctuations could be blocked by tetrodotoxin, NMDA receptor antagonists, dihydropyridines, or compounds that inhibit synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, but not by the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. When cells were treated with Mg2+-free, glycine-supplemented medium and examined 24 hr later, ∼30% of the neurons were found to have died. Cell death could be inhibited by the same agents that reduced [Ca2+]i fluctuations. These results support a role for direct excitatory synaptic transmission, as opposed to the general release of glutamate, in excitotoxicity. A major role for synaptically activated NMDA receptors, rather than kainate/quisqualate receptors, is also indicated Neuronal death may be produced by abnormal changes in neuronal [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2014913262,"We describe the cloning of SC1, a novel cDNA that was selected from a rat brain expression library using a mixed polyclonal antibody directed against synaptic junction glycoproteins. SC1 detects a 3.2 kb mRNA expressed throughout postnatal development of the brain and present at high levels in the adult. In situ hybridization reveals that the SC1 mRNA is expressed widely in the brain and is present in many types of neurons. DNA sequence data suggest that the SC1 product is a secreted, calcium binding glycoprotein. Strikingly, the carboxy-terminal region of the SC1 protein shows substantial similarity to the extracellular matrix glycoprotein osteonectin/BM40/SPARC. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that SC1 is an extracellular matrix glycoprotein in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1506295602,"The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated as an in vivo protein expression system for mammalian Na,K-ATPase. Unlike animal cells, yeast cells lack endogenous Na,K-ATPase. Expression of high affinity ouabain binding sites, ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity, or ouabain-sensitive p-nitrophenylphosphatase activity in membrane fractions of yeast cells was observed to require the expression of both alpha subunit and beta subunit polypeptides of Na,K-ATPase in the same cell. High affinity ouabain binding sites are also expressed at the cell surface of intact yeast cells containing both the alpha subunit and the beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase. These observations demonstrate that both the alpha subunit and the beta subunit of Na,K-ATPase are required for the expression of functional Na,K-ATPase activity and that yeast cells can correctly assemble this oligomeric membrane protein and transport it to the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2128674875,"Class II major histocompatibility complex antigens are intracellularly associated with a nonpolymorphic polypeptide referred to as the invariant chain. Before the class II heterodimer appears on the cell surface, the invariant chain dissociates but it has so far been unclear as to whether or not a proportion of the invariant chain also appears on the plasma membrane. We describe a study with three monoclonal antibodies which recognize an extracytoplasmic determinant present on all forms of the invariant chain and use them to demonstrate its presence on the surface of the intact cells. The determinants recognized by two of the antibodies were found to be located within the 60 amino acids at the extreme C-terminal (extracytoplasmic) end of the invariant chain. The invariant chain-specific monoclonal antibody, VIC-Y1, was found to bind a determinant located between amino acids 1 and 73, which correspond to mainly cytoplasmic residues. Using the C-terminal specific antibodies, the number of antibody binding sites on the surface of two B lymphoma lines was estimated to be 10(5) per cell. The results of this study appear to resolve the highly disputed question of whether or not the invariant chain can appear as a plasma membrane protein. The results are discussed in the context of a possible role for the invariant chain in antigen processing and presentation."
https://openalex.org/W2087893167,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) from the electric organ of T. californica is highly phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in vivo. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR in rat myotube cultures is barely detectable. To determine whether this low level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR in muscle cell cultures is due to a lack of neuronal innervation, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR in rat diaphragm in vivo. Immunofluorescent double labeling of cryostat sections of rat diaphragm using antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine or the AChR showed a direct colocalization of phosphotyrosine with the AChR at the neuromuscular junction. Using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, immunoblots of AChR partially purified from rat diaphragm demonstrated that the rat AChR contains high levels of phosphotyrosine. Denervation of rat diaphragm induced a time-dependent decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR, as measured by immunocytochemical and immunoblot techniques. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR occurred late in the development of the neuromuscular junction, between postnatal days 7 and 14. These studies suggest that muscle innervation regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the AChR and that tyrosine phosphorylation may play an important role in the developmental regulation of the AChR."
https://openalex.org/W2089967208,"N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors were expressed and studied in Xenopus oocytes injected with rat brain RNA. NMDA application elicits a rapid inward current that decays in several seconds to a relatively stable level. This decay is reportedly due to desensitization. However, we found the early transient component could be evoked more than once during a single application of NMDA, suggesting that the receptor did not actually desensitize. Removal of external Ca2+, replacement of Ca2+ with Ba2+, or intracellular injection of EGTA abolished the transient component. Furthermore, a variety of Cl- channel blockers nearly eliminated the transient component and inhibited the plateau current as well. We propose that a significant portion of the NMDA current recorded in oocytes is carried by a transient inward Cl- current triggered by Ca2+ influx through the NMDA receptor/channel."
https://openalex.org/W1964912566,"cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) play a role in nerve growth factor (NGF)-mediated differentiation. In PC12 cells, NGF causes neurite outgrowth and increases the number of voltage-gated Na+ channels. Neurite outgrowth involves in part activation of PKC. How NGF regulates Na+ channel number is unknown. Using patch-clamp techniques, we find that agents activating PKC, including phorbol esters and a ras oncogene product (p21) that induces neurites, caused little increase in channel number. In contrast, agents increasing intracellular cAMP were as effective as NGF. A specific protein inhibitor of the PKA catalytic subunit blocked increases by NGF or cAMP. Thus, NGF increases Na+ channel number in PC12 cells in part by activating PKA but apparently not PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1519573248,"The expression of three human metallothionein genes, MT-IIA, MT-IF, and MT-IG was studied in the human hepatoblastoma (HepG2), the hepatocarcinoma (Hep3B2), the embryonic kidney (Hek 293), and the lymphoblastoid-derived (Wi-L2) cell lines. The pattern of expression of each specific MT gene in response to various heavy metals was different among the four cell lines studied indicating differential regulation of MT gene expression. The MT-IF or MT-IG and the MT-IIA genes were regulated in a cell-type specific manner in response to heavy metals and dexamethasone, respectively. DNA methylation was shown to be correlated to cell-type specific regulation of MT gene expression since 5-azacytidine treatment resulted in the expression of the MT-IF and MT-IG genes in response to cadmium and zinc in Wi-L2 cells, of the MT-IIA gene in response to dexamethasone in Wi-L2 cells, and of the MT-IG in response to zinc and copper in Hek 293 cells. Furthermore, transfection studies indicated that all the trans-acting factors necessary for the expression of these genes were present and functional in Wi-L2 and Hek 293 cells. The differential level of expression of the MT-IF and MT-IG genes in response to heavy metals in the Hek 293 cell line was shown to be correlated to their chromatin structure."
https://openalex.org/W1615020669,"Inositol monophosphatase is a key enzyme of the inositol phosphate second messenger signaling pathway. It is responsible for the provision of inositol required for synthesis of phosphatidylinositol and polyphosphoinositides and has been implicated as the pharmacological target for lithium action in brain. Using oligonucleotide probes based on partial amino acid sequence data for the bovine brain enzyme, several overlapping cDNA clones of 2-3 kilobases in length have been isolated. All contain an open reading frame encoding a 277-amino acid protein. No significant sequence homology was found with any known protein. The open reading frame was inserted into a bacterial expression vector in order to confirm the presumed identity of the protein. The expressed protein reacted with an anti-inositol monophosphatase monoclonal antibody. In addition, the protein was enzymically active and indistinguishable from the bovine brain enzyme with respect to Km values for substrate and Li+ sensitivity of inositol 1-phosphate hydrolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2102877678,"The kinetic properties of Escherichia coli ribonuclease H (RNase H) were investigated using oligonucleotide substrates that consist of a short stretch of RNA, flanked on either side by DNA (DNA-RNA-DNA). In the presence of a complementary DNA strand, RNase H cleavage is restricted to the short ribonucleotide stretch of the DNA/RNA heteroduplex. The DNA-RNA-DNA substrate utilized for kinetic studies: (formula; see text) is cleaved at a single site (decreases) in the presence of a complementary DNA strand, to generate (dT)7-(rA)2-OH and p-(rA)2-(dT)9. Anion exchange high performance liquid chromatography was used to separate and quantitate the cleavage products. Under these conditions, RNase H-specific and nonspecific degradation products could be resolved. Kinetic parameters were measured under conditions of 100% hybrid formation (1.2-1.5 molar excess of complementary DNA, T much less than Tm). A linear double reciprocal plot was obtained, yielding a Km of 4.2 microM and a turnover number of 7.1 cleavages per s per RNase H monomer. The kinetic properties of substrate analogs containing varying lengths of RNA (n = 3-5) and 2'-O-methyl modifications were also investigated. Maximal turnover was observed with DNA-RNA-DNA substrates containing a minimum of four RNA residues. Kcat for the rA3 derivative was decreased by more than 100-fold. The Km appeared to decrease with the size of the internal RNA stretch (n = 3-5). No significant difference in turnover number of Km was observed when the flanking DNA was replaced with 2'-O-methyl RNA, suggesting that RNase H does not interact with this region of the heteroduplex."
https://openalex.org/W2061437690,"The origin of the intervening sequences (introns), which are removed during RNA maturation, is currently unknown. They are found in most genes encoding messenger RNAs, but are lacking in almost all small nuclear (sn)RNAs. One exceptional snRNA (U6) is part of the spliceosomal machinery that is involved in messenger RNA maturation. It has been suggested that its intron arose as a result of incorrect splicing of a messenger RNA precursor. This study revealed the presence of an intron, with the characteristic features of nuclear introns from precursors to messenger RNA, in the two genes coding for Saccharomyces cerevisiae U3 snRNA. The branch point was GACTAAC instead of the TACTAAC sequence found in all yeast introns examined so far. As U3 is a nucleolar snRNA required for maturation of ribosomal RNA, its intron could not have been acquired from aberrant messenger RNA processing in a spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W1510172068,"Suramin inhibited protein kinase C (PKC) type I-III activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Similar inhibitory effects were observed with M-kinase, the constitutively active catalytic fragment of PKC, and autophosphorylation of PKC types I-III. Kinetic experiments indicated that suramin competitively inhibits activity with respect to ATP (Ki = 17, 27, and 31 microM, respectively) and that it can also inhibit by interaction with the substrate histone III-S. With protamine as the Pi acceptor, suramin inhibition was dependent on lipid, being approximately 4-fold less sensitive to inhibition in the absence of phosphatidylserine and diacylglycerol than in their presence. Suramin at low concentrations (10-40 microM), in the presence of Ca2+ and absence of lipid, was able to stimulate kinase activity (approximately 200-400%) in a type-dependent manner and at higher concentrations inhibited activity with histone III-S as substrate. These results indicate that suramin, a hexa-anionic hydrophobic compound, can act as a negatively charged phospholipid analog in activating PKC in the presence of Ca2+ and absence of lipid and can inhibit Ca2+/phosphatidylserine/diacylglycerol-stimulated kinase activity at higher concentrations by competing with ATP or by interaction with the exogenous substrate. Suramin inhibited cAMP-dependent protein kinase much less potently (IC50 = 656 microM) than PKC. The ability of suramin to inhibit PKC-mediated processes in intact cells was tested using the phorbol ester-stimulated respiratory burst of neutrophils as a model system. The respiratory burst of human neutrophils, when preincubated with suramin and then stimulated with phorbol ester, was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that suramin may also be able to inhibit PKC-mediated processes in intact cells."

https://openalex.org/W1560516057,"The addition of interleukin 2 (IL2) to the IL2-dependent murine cytotoxic T cell line CTTL-2 induced increased tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with a molecular weight of 80,000 and, to a lesser extent, proteins with molecular weights of 130,000, 100,000, and 69,000. To correlate the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation with increased tyrosine kinase activity, cell-free phosphorylation assays were performed. Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were purified from detergent-solubilized cell lysates by immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The level of tyrosine kinase activity was determined by incorporation of [gamma-32P]ATP into the exogenous substrate histone H2B. IL2 treatment of cells increased H2B phosphorylation 10-fold when compared with nonstimulated cells. Phosphorylation was first detected after 2.5 min of incubation with physiologically relevant (100 pM) IL2 doses. To examine if tyrosine kinase activity was resident within the IL2 receptor complex, cell-free phosphorylation assays were performed with ligand-receptor complexes following cross-linking with IL2 and purification by immunoabsorption with an anti-IL2 antibody. Tyrosine kinase activity was found specifically associated with the IL2 receptor complex. These results indicate that the IL2 receptor complex contains a tyrosine kinase activity that is induced by IL2 binding and suggest that components of the complex may be a substrate of this activity."

https://openalex.org/W1539899566,"Previous studies of Fe-bleomycin-mediated DNA cleavage have established that the bithiazole moiety + C-terminal substituent of bleomycin are required for DNA binding, while the metal binding domain is responsible for O2 activation. Although recent studies have indicated that the metal binding domain also participates in DNA unwinding, and in determining the sequence and strand selectivity of DNA cleavage, no study has defined the structural domain that bears primary responsibility for the observed pattern of bleomycin-mediated DNA degradation. Presently, by the use of four synthetic analogs of bleomycin demethyl A2 having the functional domains connected by rigid spacers of varying lengths, the source of DNA cleavage specificity has been determined. When the four analogs cleaved 242- and 127-base pair 5'-32P-end-labeled DNA restriction fragments containing isolated Fe-bleomycin cleavage sites, all four produced cleavage at the same preferred sites. Because the (oligo)glycine spacers altered the distance between the domains by as much as 14 A, the identical cleavage patterns argue that the primary determinant of sequence specificity for these analogs is the metal binding domain."
https://openalex.org/W1537192588,"We recently reported the isolation and sequencing of two classes of human alpha 2(VI) collagen cDNA clones which share common sequences for the first two-thirds of the molecule but contain a different sequence of either 607 or 887 base pairs at their 3' ends (Chu, M.-L., Pan, T.-C., Conway, D., Kuo, H.-J., Glanville, R. W., Timpl, R., Mann, K., and Deutzmann, R. (1989) EMBO J. 8, 1939-1946). In the present study, we report the sequence of another cDNA clone, which is identical to one class of the previously isolated cDNAs except for a 293-base pair insertion between the common and variable regions. Together, the different classes of cDNAs, referred to as the alpha 2C2, alpha 2C2a, and alpha 2C2a' predict three variant alpha 2 chains of type VI collagen with carboxyl globular domains of 429, 328, and 238 amino acid residues, respectively. In order to explore the mechanisms by which the variations are generated, we isolated and characterized the 3' end of the human alpha 2(VI) collagen gene. The carboxyl globular domain was found to be encoded by six exons which appear to delineate its structural subdomains. The exon/intron arrangement clearly demonstrated that the cDNA variants arose from alternative splicing events by mutually exclusive utilization of the last two exons in conjunction with the selective usage of an internal splice acceptor site in the penultimate exon. The presence of the corresponding mature mRNA transcripts (3.2-3.5 kilobase pairs (kb] in human fibroblasts was shown by Northern blot hybridization, S1 nuclease protection assay, and the polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that the alpha 2C2 mRNA is the major species, whereas the alpha 2C2a and alpha 2C2a' are the minor forms. Northern blot hybridization also revealed an alpha 2(VI) collagen mRNA of 6.0 kb. This mRNA retained a 2.3-kb intron located between the two alternatively spliced exons and predicted a translational product that is the same as the alpha 2C2a variant."
https://openalex.org/W1605985159,"The pH of the intralysosomal compartment of fibroblasts in culture was monitored by measuring the fluorescence emission intensity at 530 nm of fluid phase pinocytosed fluorescein-conjugated dextrans (FITC-dextrans) excited at 488 and 457 nm. Following the procedure of Ohkuma and Poole (Ohkuma, S., and Poole, B. (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. (1978) 75, 3327-3331), a relationship was established between the fluorescence emission intensity of the FITC-dextrans and pH. This correlation was used to determine the intralysosomal apparent pH (pHapp) of a series of fibroblast cultures. The mean intralysosomal pHapp values of nontransformed mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and an infinite life-span human fibroblast cell strain, designated MSU-1.1, was 5.0. In distinction that of 3T3 fibroblasts transformed to the malignant state by Kirsten murine sarcoma virus and MSU-1.1 cells transformed by transfection of the v-Ki-ras or T24 H-ras oncogene was 6.1. These measurements suggest that ras transformation results in a significant perturbation of lysosomal pH."
https://openalex.org/W113990236,"Some human carcinoma cells constitutively produce granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) which stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of the progenitor cells of neutrophilic granulocytes. By introducing mouse G-CSF chromosomal gene or its promoter DNA into human carcinoma cell lines of CHU-2, SK-HEP-1, and U-87MG, it was shown that the constitutive expression of G-CSF in these carcinoma cells was due to the intrinsic activation of nuclear factors which work on the promoter region of the G-CSF gene. A series of 5' deletion mutants, linker scanning mutants, and internal deletion mutants was constructed in the promoter of mouse G-CSF gene and was introduced into human CHU-2 cells to analyze their promoter activities. These studies demonstrated that at least three regulatory elements in the promoter of the G-CSF gene are essential for the constitutive expression of G-CSF in CHU-2 cells. These elements include the consensus decanucleotide GAGRTTCCA/CC present on G-CSF, granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and interleukin 3 genes and the ATTTGCAT octamer transcription factor binding site. Some point mutations in these consensus sequences significantly diminished the promoter activity in CHU-2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1973013584,"Substance P (SP) is present in avian sympathetic ganglia and accelerates the decay rate of acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked macroscopic currents in sympathetic neurons. We demonstrate here that SP modulates ACh-elicited single channels in a manner consistent with an enhancement of ACh receptor (AChR) desensitization. Furthermore, since AChR channel function was monitored in cell-attached patches with SP applied to the extra-patch membrane, the peptide must act via a second messenger mechanism. SP specifically decreases the net ACh-activated single-channel current across the patch membrane by decreasing both channel opening frequency and mean open time kinetics. These experiments demonstrate that a peptide can modulate neuronal AChR function by a second messenger mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2018157702,"This paper introduces ""patch cramming,"" a new procedure that utilizes an ion channel gated directly by an intracellular messenger molecule as a probe for detecting changes in the concentration of that molecule in an intact cell. A patch pipette containing the channel in a membrane patch is inserted into a recipient cell where the channel locally ""senses"" the intracellular messenger. In this study patches containing Ca2(+)-dependent K+ channels were inserted into Helix neurons, where they were activated by Ca2+ influx during trains of action potentials. Channels gated directly by other messengers, including cyclic nucleotides and IP3, have also been identified. Hence, by using detector channels with appropriate specificity, it may be possible to detect local intracellular fluctuations of these molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1509167370,"The aerobic respiratory chain of Escherichia coli contains two terminal oxidases: the cytochrome d complex and the cytochrome o complex. Each of these enzymes catalyzes the oxidation of ubiquinol-8 within the cytoplasmic membrane and the reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Both oxidases are coupling sites in the respiratory chain; electron transfer from ubiquinol to oxygen results in the generation of a proton electrochemical potential difference across the membrane. The cytochrome d complex is a heterodimer (subunits I and II) that has three heme prosthetic groups. Previous studies characterized two monoclonal antibodies that bind to subunit I and specifically block the ability of the enzyme to oxidize ubiquinol. In this paper, the epitopes of both of these monoclonal antibodies have been mapped to within a single 11-amino acid stretch of subunit I. The epitope is located in a large hydrophilic loop between the fifth and sixth putative membrane-spanning segments. Binding experiments with these monoclonal antibodies show this polypeptide loop to be periplasmic. Such localization suggests that the loop may be close to His186, which has been identified as one of the axial ligands of cytochrome b558. Together, these data begin to define a functional domain in which ubiquinol is oxidized near the periplasmic surface of the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1550774918,"Placenta-specific expression of the gene encoding the alpha subunit of glycoprotein hormones involves the interaction of at least two different cis-acting elements: the upstream regulatory element (URE), which binds a placenta-specific trans-acting factor; and two tandem cAMP-response elements (CREs), which bind a ubiquitous protein (CRE-binding protein). To identify additional elements required for promoter activity, we used block replacement mutagenesis to produce a series of 10-base pair transversion mutations throughout the proximal promoter-regulatory region of the human alpha subunit gene. Transient expression of these constructs in choriocarcinoma cells enabled the identification of several closely spaced transcriptional control elements in addition to the previously identified URE and CREs. Gel mobility shift assays, methylation interference analyses, and UV cross-linking permitted identification of a factor that binds specifically to a canonical CCAAT box contained within the proximal promoter-regulatory of the human alpha subunit gene. This factor, which we refer to as alpha subunit CCAAT-binding factor (alpha CBF), is found in a variety of cell types and appears to be distinct from the previously characterized CCAAT-binding factors CTF/NF1, C/EBP, CP1, and NF-Y. We suggest that interaction of alpha CBF with factors binding to the URE and CREs may be required for maximal activity of the alpha subunit promoter in placental cells."
https://openalex.org/W1545777282,"Regulation of two highly homologous GTP-binding regulatory protein- (G-protein) linked receptors, beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors, was probed at the level of mRNA in differentiating 3T3-L1 cells. Expression of the two receptor subtypes at the protein level was defined by competition of radioligand binding with CGP-20712A, a highly selective beta 1-adrenergic antagonist. 3T3-L1 fibroblasts express equivalent levels of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptors. Following treatment with dexamethasone and isobutylmethyl xanthine (IBMX), 3T3-L1 cells differentiate to adipocytes and express 4-fold more receptor, predominantly beta 2-subtype (beta 1-/beta 2- ratio, 5:95). Regulation of beta 1- and beta 2-receptor mRNA levels by differentiation, as well as by steroid alone and IBMX alone was probed by DNA excess solution hybridization. A beta 1-receptor antisense probe was constructed from double-stranded DNA assembled from synthetic oligonucleotides. In untreated 3T3-L1 fibroblasts the steady-state levels of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenergic receptor mRNA were equivalent (approximately 1.2 amol mRNA/micrograms total cellular RNA). beta 2-Adrenergic receptor mRNA levels increased 3-fold as 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were differentiated to adiopcytes (day 7). mRNA levels for beta 1-adrenergic receptor, in contrast, increased at day 2, but thereafter declined, falling to less than 0.05 amol mRNA/micrograms total cellular RNA by day 7 in adipocytes. A 7-day challenge with dexamethasone reduced by 50% beta 1-adrenergic receptor mRNA levels. Treatment with IBMX alone reduced mRNA levels for both receptor subtypes. Neither steroid nor IBMX alone promoted differentiation. The present work, for the first time, demonstrates (i) the mRNA levels on a molar basis for two highly homologous G-protein-linked receptors expressed in a single cell, (ii) independent regulation of their mRNA levels that correlates well with receptor expression, and (iii), that it is differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells per se and not treatment with glucocorticoid or IBMX alone that promotes the up-regulation of the beta 2-receptor transcripts and down-regulation of beta 1-receptor transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W1569433052,"We have reported previously that a dietary deficiency in selenium results in an increase in glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity of various rat tissues. In order to verify that the increased GST activity observed in a selenium deficiency results from increased synthesis of GST protein, cytosolic fractions of livers obtained from rats fed selenium-deficient and selenium-supplemented diets were analyzed by Western (protein) blots. Antisera raised against purified individual GST subunits (Ya, Yb, and Yc) were used to detect the corresponding subunits on the blots. The Ya subunit was induced 2.5-fold in the selenium-deficient state. The amount of Yc subunit also increased significantly (p less than 0.05) in selenium deficiency but not to the extent of the Ya subunit. The Yb subunit was not significantly affected by altered selenium nutritional status. A corresponding increase in poly(A) RNAs coding for the Ya and Yc subunits was also observed by Northern blot analysis. Transcriptional activity of GST YaYc genes was elevated by approximately 2-fold in purified nuclei isolated from selenium-deficient rat livers, which is sufficient to account for the increase in YaYc mRNA levels. Therefore, it appears that transcriptional activation of rat liver YaYc genes is the primary cause for the elevation of the corresponding gene products in the selenium-deficient state. Since the GSTs, especially the isozymes containing Ya subunit, have been implicated in the formation of prostaglandin (PG) F2 alpha, we investigated the effect of selenium deficiency on the PGF2 alpha-forming activity using a specific inhibitor of GSTs, S-decyl-GSH. In rats fed a nutritionally adequate diet, the activity inhibited by S-decyl-GSH accounted for at least half of the conversion of PGH2 to PGF2 alpha. During selenium deficiency, this GST-catalyzed activity was approximately doubled with no change in PGF2 alpha formation by other pathways, resulting in a 2-fold increase in overall synthesis of PGF2 alpha. These data strongly support a role of GSTs, especially those composed of the Ya size subunit, in the synthesis of PGF2 alpha from PGH2."

https://openalex.org/W1630449726,"At the initial phase of cell differentiation in mouse neuroblastoma (N18) induced by dibutyrylcyclic AMP (dbcAMP), an additional site of histone H1 was extensively phosphorylated. Forskolin and various phosphodiesterase inhibitors also induced both cell differentiation and H1 phosphorylation at the identical site. The phosphorylation preferentially occurred in a single H1 subtype (H1c) among the five (H1a-e) fractionated by high performance liquid chromatography. The three H1 subtypes of N18 (H1c, H1d, and H1e) were phosphorylated in vitro, and their amino acid sequences of the phosphopeptides were identical to the known sequence of rabbit H1 peptides containing a serine 37 residue. However, the amount of H1a and H1b phosphorylations was negligible. The serine residue was replaced by threonine residue in H1a, and H1b did not have a homologous peptide. The tryptic phosphopeptides of H1 in N18 were identical to that in rat liver H1 induced by glucagon (Langan, T.A. (1969) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 64, 1276-1283). The results indicate that 1) the response of H1 subtypes to cAMP-dependent protein kinase in vivo and in vitro is H1 subtype-specific, and 2) the H1c phosphorylation may play an important role in the restrictive area of chromatin in both cell differentiation and hormonal stimulation mediated by cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1498863785,"The expression of chromosomal proteins HMG-14 and HMG-17 during cellular differentiation was studied in cultured mouse myoblasts. During myogenesis the level of both HMG-14 and HMG-17 mRNA decreased to less than 20% of that found in myoblasts. The down-regulation of HMG-14/-17 mRNA occurred simultaneously with activation of muscle-specific actin mRNA and was not linked to DNA synthesis, indicating that it is a differentiation-, rather than a cell cycle-related event. Incorporation of radiolabeled lysine into HMG proteins was similar to that into the major histone fractions in that it was significant in myoblasts and undetectable in myotubes. The decrease in mRNA and protein synthesis did not affect the cellular levels of HMG protein. These results indicate that the regulation of HMG-14/-17 mRNA levels is different from that of the histones and is linked to differentiation rather than to DNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1481689105,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta 1) suppresses cortisol production when added to cultured bovine adrenocortical (BAC) cells while concomitantly increasing fibronectin synthesis and assembly into extracellular fibrils. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of gelatin-Sepharose-treated media from BAC cells demonstrated a 2-fold stimulation of fibronectin production by TGF-beta 1 in both the presence and absence of serum. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed that TGF-beta 1 caused a striking increase in the fibronectin content of BAC extracellular matrix. TGF-beta 1 caused a 4-fold increase in deoxycholate-insoluble fibronectin after 12 h and a 7-fold increase after 24 h over that of control BAC cultures. Northern hybridization analyses indicated that TGF-beta 1 stimulated levels of fibronectin poly(A)+ RNA 2.3-fold. We found that cultured BAC cells express TGF-beta 1 mRNA, suggesting a possible autocrine role for TGF-beta 1 in the adrenal."
https://openalex.org/W1566689904,"The effects of thyroid hormone on expression of cardiac myosin heavy chain genes generally are thought to be mediated by nuclear 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) receptors that have been identified as the products of the protooncogene, c-erbA. This hypothesis has been tested by transfection of cardiomyocytes in primary culture with a plasmid, pRSVhEACAT-, expressing anti-sense c-erbA mRNA. Because only a low percentage of cells (20%) could be transfected in primary culture an alpha-myosin heavy chain-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion construct was used as a reporter gene. The results indicate that the anti-sense plasmid almost completely blocks T3-induced activity of the reporter gene (less than 1% control) while transfection of a similar amount of the sense construct, pRSVhEACAT+, has no effect. When the c-erbA plasmids were cotransfected with constructs containing T3-independent promoters, no effects on expression were observed. The combined use of an anti-sense construct and a report gene provides a means of studying the role of c-erbA products in intracellular signal transduction even in differentiated, nondividing cells like those of the heart."
https://openalex.org/W155723902,"A genomic DNA fragment from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which contains the SRA5 (=PDE2) gene, coding for a low Km cAMP-phosphodiesterase, was transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Clones carring the cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene were capable of growth in the presence of cholera toxin, which slows the growth of untransfected cells by elevating their cAMP levels. The cholera toxin-resistant transfected cell lines expressed high levels of cAMP-phosphodiesterase mRNA and cAMP-phosphodiesterase activity. Basal intracellular cAMP levels were not significantly affected by the presence of the yeast cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene, but elevation of cAMP levels in response to cholera toxin or prostaglandin E1 was suppressed. Induction of the cAMP-responsive tyrosine aminotransferase promoter by cholera toxin was also blocked in cell lines carrying the yeast cAMP-phosphodiesterase gene. Cholera toxin-resistant transfected cell lines were sensitive to the growth inhibitory effects of N6,02'-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, which can be used to bypass the effects of the yeast cAMP-phosphodiesterase."

https://openalex.org/W1545980180,"In vitro transcription studies with a trp leader DNA template derived from a double deletion mutant of Serratia marcescens revealed that the transcription complex pauses synthesis of part of the RNA antiterminator, structure 2:3. Pausing was enhanced by NusA protein and was dependent on the concentration of UTP in the transcription reaction mixture. A weak antiterminator pause also was detected during transcription of the wild-type S. marcescens trp leader template in the presence of NusA protein and 1 microM UTP. Transcription pausing following synthesis of the antiterminator also was observed in a cell-free transcription-translation system. Antiterminator-induced pausing may play an important role in vivo by delaying synthesis of RNA segment 4. This delay may influence basal level control in cells with an excess of tryptophan. In addition, formation of the antiterminator pause structure may introduce a more stringent tryptophan starvation requirement for RNA polymerase to read through the attenuator."
