https://openalex.org/W1968768356,"Background Saliva of blood sucking arthropods contains compounds that antagonize their hosts' hemostasis, which include platelet aggregation, vasoconstriction and blood clotting; saliva of these organisms also has anti-inflammatory and immunomodullatory properties. Perhaps because hosts mount an active immune response against these compounds, the diversity of these compounds is large even among related blood sucking species. Because of these properties, saliva helps blood feeding as well as help the establishment of pathogens that can be transmitted during blood feeding. Methodology/Principal Findings We have obtained 1,626,969 reads by pyrosequencing a salivary gland cDNA library from adult females Amblyomma maculatum ticks at different times of feeding. Assembly of this data produced 72,441 sequences larger than 149 nucleotides from which 15,914 coding sequences were extracted. Of these, 5,353 had >75% coverage to their best match in the non-redundant database from the National Center for Biotechnology information, allowing for the deposition of 4,850 sequences to GenBank. The annotated data sets are available as hyperlinked spreadsheets. Putative secreted proteins were classified in 133 families, most of which have no known function. Conclusions/Significance This data set of proteins constitutes a mining platform for novel pharmacologically active proteins and for uncovering vaccine targets against A. maculatum and the diseases they carry."
https://openalex.org/W2039405310,"Background Acquisition of the intestinal microbiota in early life corresponds with the development of the mucosal immune system. Recent work on caesarean-delivered infants revealed that early microbial composition is influenced by birthing method and environment. Furthermore, we have confirmed that early-life environment strongly influences both the adult gut microbiota and development of the gut immune system. Here, we address the impact of limiting microbial exposure after initial colonization on the development of adult gut immunity. Methodology/Principal Findings Piglets were born in indoor or outdoor rearing units, allowing natural colonization in the immediate period after birth, prior to transfer to high-health status isolators. Strikingly, gut closure and morphological development were strongly affected by isolator-rearing, independent of indoor or outdoor origins of piglets. Isolator-reared animals showed extensive vacuolation and disorganization of the gut epithelium, inferring that normal gut closure requires maturation factors present in maternal milk. Although morphological maturation and gut closure were delayed in isolator-reared animals, these hard-wired events occurred later in development. Type I IFN, IL-22, IL-23 and Th17 pathways were increased in indoor-isolator compared to outdoor-isolator animals during early life, indicating greater immune activation in pigs originating from indoor environments reflecting differences in the early microbiota. This difference was less apparent later in development due to enhanced immune activation and convergence of the microbiota in all isolator-reared animals. This correlated with elevation of Type I IFN pathways in both groups, although T cell pathways were still more affected in indoor-reared animals. Conclusions/Significance Environmental factors, in particular microbial exposure, influence expression of a large number of immune-related genes. However, the homeostatic effects of microbial colonization in outdoor environments require sustained microbial exposure throughout development. Gut development in high-hygiene environments negatively impacts on normal succession of the gut microbiota and promotes innate immune activation which may impair immune homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1972558437,"Recent reports have revealed genomic clustering of enzymatic genes for particular biosynthetic pathways in plant specialized/secondary metabolism. Rice (Oryza sativa) carries two such clusters for production of antimicrobial diterpenoid phytoalexins, with the cluster on chromosome 2 containing four closely related/homologous members of the cytochrome P450 CYP76M subfamily (CYP76M5–8). Notably, the underlying evolutionary expansion of these CYP appears to have occurred after assembly of the ancestral biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting separate roles. It has been demonstrated that CYP76M7 catalyzes C11α-hydroxylation of ent-cassadiene, and presumably mediates an early step in biosynthesis of the derived phytocassane class of phytoalexins. Here we report biochemical characterization of CYP76M5, -6, and -8. Our results indicate that CYP76M8 is a multifunctional/promiscuous hydroxylase, with CYP76M5 and -7 seeming to provide only redundant activity, while CYP76M6 seems to provide both redundant and novel activity, relative to CYP76M8. RNAi-mediated double knockdown of CYP76M7 and -8 suppresses elicitor inducible phytocassane production, indicating a role for these monooxygenases in phytocassane biosynthesis. In addition, our data suggests that CYP76M5, -6, and -8 may play redundant roles in production of the oryzalexin class of phytoalexins as well. Intriguingly, the preceding diterpene synthase for oryzalexin biosynthesis, unlike that for the phytocassanes, is not found in the chromosome 2 diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster. Accordingly, our results not only uncover a complex evolutionary history, but also further suggest some intriguing differences between plant biosynthetic gene clusters and the seemingly similar microbial operons. The implications for the underlying metabolic evolution of plants are then discussed.

Accordingly, our results not only uncover a complex evolutionary history, but also further suggest some intriguing differences between plant biosynthetic gene clusters and the seemingly similar microbial operons. The implications for the underlying metabolic evolution of plants are then discussed. Traditionally, genes are considered to be essentially randomly distributed in the genomes of multicellular eukaryotic organisms, in contrast with microbes, where co-regulated genes with related functions (e.g. those involved a particular biosynthetic pathway) often are clustered together (1.Fischbach M.A. Walsh C.T. Clardy J. The evolution of gene collectives. How natural selection drives chemical innovation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4601-4608Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that nonhomologous enzymatic genes for some more specialized/secondary biosynthetic pathways also are physically clustered together in some plant genomes (2.Osbourn A. Gene clusters for secondary metabolic pathways. An emerging theme in plant biology.Plant Physiol. 2010; 154: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), for example, the cyclic hydroxamic acid pathway in maize (3.Frey M. Chomet P.

Although such clusters appear to be an emerging theme in plant secondary metabolism (2.Osbourn A. Gene clusters for secondary metabolic pathways. An emerging theme in plant biology.Plant Physiol. 2010; 154: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), these still represent exceptions rather than reflecting the general genomic organization pattern found in microbial genomes. Thus, it remains unclear how these clusters were assembled, and what the evolutionary implications are for the contained genes. Of particular interest here is whether the activity of the encoded enzymes limited to that required for the corresponding biosynthetic pathway. This is thought to be largely true in microbial biosynthetic gene clusters, and such specificity has been implied for the enzymes found in plant biosynthetic gene clusters as well, yet broader activity would have interesting implications for metabolic evolution. Rice (Oryza sativa) produces a complex mixture of antimicrobial natural products in response to microbial infection (10.Peters R.J.

Recent advances regarding diterpene cyclase genes in higher plants and fungi.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), wherein separate groups are produced in response to fungi (e.g. the blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae), relative to bacteria (e.g. the leaf blight pathogen Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae). In particular, the oryzalides seem to be antibacterial phytoalexins (12.Watanabe M. Kono Y. Esumi Y. Teraoka T. Hosokawa D. Suzuki Y. Sakurai A. Watanabe M. Studies on a quantitative analysis of oryzalides and oryzalic acids in rice plants by GC-SIM.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1460-1463Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar), whereas the other groups (Fig. 1) are antifungal phytoalexins (10.Peters R.J.

Recent advances regarding diterpene cyclase genes in higher plants and fungi.Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2008; 72: 1168-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These phytoalexins are almost entirely all labdane-related diterpenoids, whose biosynthesis is characterized by an initial pair of sequential cyclization reactions (13.Peters R.J. Two rings in them all. The labdane-related diterpenoids.Nat. Prod. Rep. 2010; 27: 1521-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Specifically, bicyclization of the universal diterpenoid precursor (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate by copalyl/labdadienyl diphosphate (CPP) 2The abbreviations used are: CPPcopalyl diphosphateCPSCPP synthaseCYPcytochrome P450KSLkaurene synthase likeCPRcytochrome P450 reductaseGSgas chromatography. synthases (CPS), which is followed by further cyclization and/or rearrangement to a polycyclic olefin catalyzed by enzymes often termed kaurene synthase-like (KSL) for their relationship to the presumably ancestral ent-kaurene synthase from gibberellin phytohormone metabolism (Fig. 1). Production of the bioactive diterpenoid phytoalexins then further requires the action of at least cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases (14.Kato H. Kodama O. Akatsuka T. Characterization of an inducible P450 hydroxylase involved in the rice diterpene phytoalexin biosynthetic pathway.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 707-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). copalyl diphosphate CPP synthase cytochrome P450 kaurene synthase like cytochrome P450 reductase gas chromatography. Two labdane-related diterpenoid phytoalexin gene clusters have been reported in rice, one located on chromosome 4 and the other on chromosome 2. The gene cluster on chromosome 4 is involved in producing momilactones, and contains the relevant syn-CPP synthase (OsCPS4) and syn-pimaradiene synthase (OsKSL4)(7.Wilderman P.R. Xu M. Jin Y. Coates R.M. Peters R.J. Identification of syn-pimara-7,15-diene synthase reveals functional clustering of terpene synthases involved in rice phytoalexin/allelochemical biosynthesis.Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 2098-2105Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In addition, this cluster also contains a short chain alcohol dehydrogenase that catalyzes the final step in production of momilactone A, and two closely related P450s (CYP99A2 and -3), one or both of which are required for momilactone biosynthesis (8.Shimura K. Okada A. Okada K. Jikumaru Y. Ko K.W. Toyomasu T. Sassa T. Hasegawa M. Kodama O. Shibuya N. Koga J. Nojiri H. Yamane H. Identification of a biosynthetic gene cluster in rice for momilactones.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34013-34018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Recently, we have demonstrated that CYP99A3 acts as a syn-pimaradiene oxidase to produce syn-pimaradien-19-oic acid, presumably as an intermediate en route to the 19,6-γ-lactone ring of the momilactones (15.Wang Q. Hillwig M.L. Peters R.J. CYP99A3, functional identification of a diterpene oxidase from the momilactone biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant J. 2011; 65: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to assign a separate biochemical function to CYP99A2. Thus, it remains unclear why this apparently momilactone biosynthesis dedicated gene cluster contains these two closely related CYP. The other diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster, on chromosome 2 (Fig. 2), is uniquely multifunctional, being involved in the production of at least two classes of phytoalexins, the antifungal phytocassanes and antibacterial oryzalides (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J. CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11α-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Both of these, along with the antifungal oryzalexins, share an ent-CPP intermediate in common with gibberellin hormone biosynthesis (Fig. 1). However, there appear to be separate ent-CPP synthases for gibberellin (OsCPS1) versus phytoalexin (OsCPS2) biosynthesis (6.Prisic S. Xu M. Wilderman P.R. Peters R.J.

The chromosome 2 gene cluster contains the phytoalexin-specific OsCPS2, along with three subsequently acting ent-CPP-specific KSL (OsKSL5–7). Of these, OsKSL7 produces the ent-cassadiene precursor to the phytocassanes, and OsKSL6 the ent-isokaurene precursor to the oryzalides, although the metabolic fate of the ent-pimaradiene produced by OsKSL5 remains unclear (18.Cho E.M.

Functional characterization of the rice kaurene synthase-like gene family.Phytochemistry. 2007; 68: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In addition, this gene cluster further contains six CYP, which fall into two closely related/homologous groups, composed of CYP71Z6 and -7 and CYP76M5–8, respectively. We have previously reported that the CYP76M7 found in the gene cluster on rice chromosome 2 catalyzes C11α-hydroxylation of ent-cassadiene, presumably en route to the C11-keto functionality found in all the bioactive phytocassanes (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J. CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11α-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis carried out as part of that study indicated that the co-clustered and closely related CYP76M5–8 seem to be derived from a common ancestral CYP76M subfamily member that was incorporated in the original form of this biosynthetic gene cluster and subsequently underwent gene expansion. This raises the question of what metabolic function(s) are carried out by these other CYP76M subfamily members, i.e. what provided the selective pressure that enabled the expanded CYP76M5–8 version of the biosynthetic gene cluster to sweep through the population. Here, we report biochemical characterization of CYP76M5, -6, and -8, uncovering a range of activity. Although we provide strong support for a role for CYP76M7 and -8 in phytocassane biosynthesis via RNAi-mediated double knockdown lines, our biochemical data further suggests putative roles in “other” biosynthetic pathways for CYP76M5–8. In particular, ones for which the upstream enzymatic genes are not co-clustered (e.g. that for the oryzalexins). The implications of this for the interplay between biosynthetic gene clusters and metabolic evolution in plants are then discussed. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were purchased from Fisher Scientific and molecular biology reagents from Invitrogen. Sequence analyses were done with the CLC Sequence Viewer program (version 6.5; CLCbio), with the presented phylogenetic tree and bootstrap values calculated via the neighbor-joining algorithm (21.Zhang J. Li C. Wu C. Xiong L. Chen G. Zhang Q. Wang S. RMD, a rice mutant database for functional analysis of the rice genome.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D745-D748Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), with 1000 replicates. Determination of the presented gene map, along with the CYP nomenclature used here, has been previously described (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J.

Gas chromatography (GC) was performed with a Varian (Palo Alto, CA) 3900 GC with Saturn 2100 ion trap mass spectrometer (MS) in electron ionization (70 eV) mode for GC-MS and GC-MS/MS analysis, or with an Agilent 6890N GC for flame ionization detection. Samples (1 μl) were injected in splitless mode at 50 °C and, after holding for 3 min at 50 °C, the oven temperature was raised at a rate of 14 °C/min to 300 °C, where it was held for an additional 3 min. MS data from 90 to 600 m/z were collected starting 12 min after injection until the end of the run.

Collection, mapping, and annotation of over 28,000 cDNA clones from japonica rice.Science. 2003; 301: 376-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), has been previously described (9.Swaminathan S.

For functional bacterial expression, CYP765, -6, and -8 were modified at their N termini via a two-stage PCR process, first removing part of the 5′ end of the open reading frame (39 codons for CYP76M5, 38 codons for CYP76M6, and 33 codons for CYP76M8), and then adding 10 new codons (encoding the amino acid sequence “MAKKTSSKGK”) in each case, which was based on the modifications used for bacterial expression of the mammalian CYP2B subfamily (23.Scott E.E. Spatzenegger M. Halpert J.R. A truncation of 2B subfamily cytochromes P450 yields increased expression levels, increased solubility, and decreased aggregation while retaining function.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 395: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The resulting constructs were cloned into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO via directional topoisomerization, and verified by complete gene sequencing. These were then transferred into a previously described pCDF-Duet (Novagen)-derived vector, specifically via directional recombination into a DEST cassette contained in the first multiple cloning site, whereas the vector also contains a rice CPR (OsCPR1) in the second multiple cloning site (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J. CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11α-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Many of the CYP76M subfamily members (as described under “Results”) were completely recoded to optimize codon usage for Escherichia coli expression via gene synthesis (GenScript; see supplemental data for corresponding nucleotide sequences). These synthetic gene constructs also were then N-terminal modified as described above with all constructs, then inserted into the Gateway system as described above. Recombinant baculovirus-based expression of CYP76M5–8 has been previously described (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J. CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11α-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, the recombinant baculoviruses were created using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression system with Gateway-derived pDEST8 constructs. These were then used to express targeted CYP76M subfamily members in Sf21 insect cells, with microsomes or lysates isolated from the resulting recombinant cell cultures, and used for in vitro assays, again as previously described (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J. CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11α-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), but with substitution of the described diterpenes for the previously tested ent-cassadiene. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against the incorporated His6 tag. All native and recoded P450 genes were recombinantly expressed in the C41 Overexpress strain of E. coli (Lucigen, Middleton, WI) using our previously described modular diterpene metabolic engineering system (24.Cyr A. Wilderman P.R. Determan M. Peters R.J. A modular approach for facile biosynthesis of labdane-related diterpenes.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 6684-6685Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Specifically, we co-expressed these CYP from the OsCPR1 co-expression constructs described above, with a (E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase and CPS carried on co-compatible pGGXC vectors, and KSL was expressed from the additionally co-compatible pDEST14 or pDEST15 (i.e. use of pDEST15 enabled expression as a fusion to glutathione S-transferase). Enzymatic products were extracted from liquid cultures (media and cells), typically 50-ml volumes grown for 72 h at 16 °C after induction, with an equal volume of hexane and analyzed by GC-MS. In every case, the expected diterpene olefin product (i.e. given the co-expressed diterpene synthases) was observed, with hydroxylated diterpenoids detected as described above (Fig. 4). To obtain novel enzymatic products in sufficient amounts for NMR analysis, flux was increased into isoprenoid metabolism and the cultures were also simply scaled up. To increase flux, the cultures were further transformed with pMBI vector encoding the bottom half of the mevalonate-dependent isoprenoid precursor pathway (25.Martin V.J. Pitera D.J. Withers S.T. Newman J.D. Keasling J.D. Engineering a mevalonate pathway in Escherichia coli for production of terpenoids.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 796-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar), which is co-compatible with those mentioned above, and 20 mm mevalonolactone fed to these recombinant cultures, as previously described (26.Morrone D. Lowry L. Determan M.K. Hershey D.M. Xu M. Peters R.J. Increasing diterpene yield with a modular metabolic engineering system in E. coli. Comparison of MEV and MEP isoprenoid precursor pathway engineering.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2010; 85: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The resulting hydroxylated diterpenoids were extracted and purified as previously described (9.Swaminathan S. Morrone D. Wang Q. Fulton D.B. Peters R.J. CYP76M7 is an ent-cassadiene C11α-hydroxylase defining a second multifunctional diterpenoid biosynthetic gene cluster in rice.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 3315-3325Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly, these compounds were produced in 3 × 1-liter cultures, which were extracted with an equal volume of a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and hexanes, and the organic extract was then dried by rotary evaporation. The resulting residue was dissolved in 5 ml of 45% methanol, 45% acetonitrile, 10% dH2O, and the hydroxylated diterpenoids were purified by HPLC. This was carried out using an Agilent 1100 series instrument equipped with autosampler, fraction collector, and diode array UV detection, over a ZORBAX Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. The column was pre-equilibrated with 20% acetonitrile/dH2O, sample loaded, then the column was washed with 20% acetonitrile/dH2O (0–2 min), and eluted with 20–100% acetonitrile (2–7 min), followed by a 100% acetonitrile wash (7–27 min). Following purification, each compound was dried under a gentle stream of N2, and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of deuterated chloroform (CDCl3; Sigma), with this evaporation-resuspension process repeated two more times to completely remove the protonated acetonitrile solvent, resulting in a final estimated ∼5–10 mg of each novel diterpenoid. NMR spectra for the diterpenoids were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic probe for 1H and 13C. Structural analysis was performed using one-dimensional 1H, and two-dimensional DQF-COSY, HSQC, HMQC, HMBC, and NOESY experiment spectra acquired at 500 MHz, and one-dimensional 13C and DEPT135 spectra (125.5 MHz) using standard experiments from the Bruker TopSpin version 1.3 software. All compounds were dissolved in 0.5-ml of chloroform-d and placed in NMR tubes for analyses, and chemical shifts were referenced using known chloroform-d (13C 77.23, 1H 7.24 ppm) signals offset from TMS. Correlations from the HMBC spectra were used to propose a partial structure, whereas connections between protonated carbons were obtained from DQF-COSY data to complete the partial structure and assign proton chemical shifts, which was particularly important for assigning the alcohol carbon to the C6 versus C7 position. The configuration of the A and B rings is predetermined by the configuration of the CPP intermediate, because the ring structure was not altered. Thus, nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) signals between the C5 proton and the alcohol methine proton could be used to assign the α or β configuration of the C7 hydroxylation products. For the C6-hydroxylated products, all derived from syn-CPP, the β configuration of the hydroxyl group was based on the lack of NOE signals between the C6 methine proton and the C5 and/or C9 methine protons typically observed and the C20 chemical shift observed for ent-sandacopimaradiene and ent-pimaradiene (0.695 and 0.754 ppm). If the C6 hydroxyl group was in the α configuration the C20 methyl 1H signal would be at least 1.0 ppm, as observed for the ent-kaurene and ent-isokaurene CYP76M6 and -8 produced alcohols due to slight de-shielding caused by the hydroxyl group. Kinetic analysis of CYP76M6 and -8 was carried out much as previously described (15.Wang Q. Hillwig M.L. Peters R.J.

Briefly, these were co-expressed with OsCPR1, using the constructs described above, in the C41 Overexpress strain of E. coli. These recombinant cultures were complemented with the addition of 1 mm thiamine, 5 mg/liter of riboflavin, and 75 mg/liter of δ-amino levulinic acid at the time of induction. In vitro assays were carried out with microsomal preparations from these cultures, with quantification of CYP by reduced CO-binding difference spectra using an extinction coefficient of 91 mm−1 cm−1 (27.Omura T.

https://openalex.org/W2085103300,"WTX is a tumor suppressor protein that is lost or mutated in up to 30% of cases of Wilms tumor. Among its known functions, WTX interacts with the β-transducin repeat containing family of ubiquitin ligase adaptors and promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of the transcription factor β-catenin, a key control point in the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. Here, we report that WTX interacts with a second ubiquitin ligase adaptor, KEAP1, which functions to regulate the ubiquitination of the transcription factor NRF2, a key control point in the antioxidant response. Surprisingly, we find that unlike its ability to promote the ubiquitination of β-catenin, WTX inhibits the ubiquitination of NRF2. WTX and NRF2 compete for binding to KEAP1, and thus loss of WTX leads to rapid ubiquitination and degradation of NRF2 and a reduced response to cytotoxic insult. These results expand our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of WTX and reveal a novel regulatory mechanism governing the antioxidant response."

To determine the link between the integrated stress response and the transsulfuration pathway, we used homocysteine (Hcy) as an inducer of eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 gene induction. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking ATF4 (ATF4−/−) had reduced GSH levels and increased reactive oxygen species and were susceptible to apoptotic cell death under normal culture conditions. Further, ATF4−/− MEFs were more sensitive to Hcy-induced cytotoxicity and showed significantly reduced intracellular GSH levels associated with apoptosis. ATF4−/− MEFs could be rescued from l-Hcy-induced apoptosis by β-mercaptoethanol medium supplementation that increases cysteine levels and restores GSH synthesis. ATF4−/− MEFs showed little or no CSE protein but did express cystathionine β-synthase. Further, ER stress-inducing agents, including tunicamycin and thapsigargin, induced the expression of CSE in ATF4+/+ MEFs. Consistent with ATF4−/− MEFs, CSE−/− MEFs showed significantly greater apoptosis when treated with tunicamycin, thapsigargin, and l-Hcy, compared with CSE+/+ MEFs.

In these studies, Hcy plasma levels at base line before B-vitamin and folic acid therapy were in the normal to mild range. In contrast, homocysteine-lowering therapy in patients with severe homocystinuria, due to CBS deficiency resulted in a 10-fold reduction in relative risk of adverse vascular events (6.Yap S.

This proatherogenic effect, however, is dependent on other established cardiovascular risk factors, including enhanced proinflammatory response and elevation of VLDL cholesterol (10.Zhou J.

It has been demonstrated that HHcy results in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) (12.Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Pfeifer S.I. Pamidi S. Podor T.J.

The addition of exogenous Hcy doses (100–500 μm) to cultured cells also leads to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation (14.Yan S.K. Chang T. Wang H. Wu L. Wang R. Meng Q.H. Effects of hydrogen sulfide on homocysteine-induced oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This may be the result of Hcy down-regulating the intracellular levels of antioxidant enzymes (15.Handy D.E. Zhang Y. Loscalzo J. Homocysteine down-regulates cellular glutathione peroxidase (GPx1) by decreasing translation.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15518-15525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Further, Hcy has been shown to modify protein structure through homocysteinylation, which could lead to protein misfolding and account for its cytotoxic effects (16.Jakubowski H.

Elevation of plasma Hcy levels accelerates atherosclerosis in mouse models through pathological processes that cause ER stress and activation of the UPR (17.Zhou J. Werstuck G.H.

Peroxynitrite, the oxidized product of nitric oxide, mediates protein nitration and co-localizes with ER stress induction in early atherosclerotic lesions (18.Dickhout J.G. Hossain G.S. Pozza L.M. Zhou J. Lhoták S. Austin R.C. Peroxynitrite causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in human vascular endothelium. Implications in atherogenesis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2623-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). ER stress has also been shown to induce ROS generation, which may involve glutathione (GSH) depletion due to GSH-mediated reduction of unstable or improperly formed disulfide bonds (19.Malhotra J.D. Kaufman R.J. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and oxidative stress. A vicious cycle or a double-edged sword?.Antioxid Redox Signal. 2007; 9: 2277-2293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). Thus, Hcy may exert its harmful effects in atherosclerotic lesions through ER stress-induced ROS generation and oxidation of nitric oxide to form peroxynitrite (18.Dickhout J.G. Hossain G.S. Pozza L.M. Zhou J. Lhoták S. Austin R.C. Peroxynitrite causes endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in human vascular endothelium. Implications in atherogenesis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

The induction of protein folding chaperones, such as the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78) and the 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94), has been shown to inhibit apoptosis (18.Dickhout J.G.

Further, UPR activation through the protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) pathway leads to the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), which in turn inhibits general translation initiation and reduces the cellular burden of unfolded proteins. However, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is selectively translated (21.Malhotra J.D. Kaufman R.J. The endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 716-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). ATF4 increases the expression of a number of genes that modulate amino acid metabolism and transport, cellular redox status, and UPR activation as well as CHOP/GADD153 expression (21.Malhotra J.D. Kaufman R.J. The endoplasmic reticulum and the unfolded protein response.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 18: 716-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). In addition to PERK, other kinases, namely GCN2 (general control non-repressed 2), HRI (heme-regulated eIF2α kinase), and protein kinase R, have also been shown to induce eIF2α phosphorylation and the preferential translation of ATF4. This pathway is referred to as the integrated stress response (ISR) because it maintains the balance between restoration of cellular homeostasis under physiological stress and apoptosis (22.Dey S. Baird T.D. Zhou D. Palam L.R. Spandau D.F. Wek R.C. Both transcriptional regulation and translational control of ATF4 are central to the integrated stress response.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 33165-33174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that ATF4-deficient (ATF4−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are sensitive to oxidative stress and require amino acid supplementation and reducing equivalents added to the medium to survive (23.Harding H.P.

Pennathur S. Pipe S.W. Kaufman R.J. Antioxidants reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve protein secretion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18525-18530Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar) and Hcy has been shown to induce oxidative stress directly (14.Yan S.K. Chang T. Wang H. Wu L. Wang R. Meng Q.H. Effects of hydrogen sulfide on homocysteine-induced oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 485-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that ATF4 acts as a prosurvival factor by enhancing the cellular capacity for GSH synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway. In this report, we show that ATF4−/− MEFs displayed increased apoptosis in a condition of excess ROS generation. These cells also demonstrated GSH depletion that could be rescued by high dose amino acid supplementation necessary for the synthesis of GSH (glycine, l-glutamic acid, and l-cysteine). Increased GSH levels using this supplementation also inhibited apoptotic cell death. The sensitivity of these ATF4−/− MEFs to GSH depletion appears to involve impairment in the transsulfuration pathway for l-cysteine synthesis due to very low or absent CSE expression. Cells in this state showed increased sensitivity to GSH depletion by Hcy treatment, resulting in greater apoptotic cell death. These findings imply that ATF4 can modulate intracellular levels of GSH by altering the expression of genes in the transsulfuration pathway. In support of the concept that CSE expression is a critical factor for GSH synthesis, CSE-deficient (CSE−/−) mice demonstrated down-regulation of GSH levels in liver and kidney. Moreover, CSE−/− MEFs are more sensitive to both Hcy and ER stress-induced apoptosis caused by thapsigargin (Tg) and tunicamycin (Tm). Taken together, these findings suggest that ATF4-dependent expression of CSE is an important cellular process that maintains cellular redox status during ER stress via the transsulfuration pathway. Wild type (CSE+/+) and CSE-deficient (CSE−/−) mice were used for kidney and liver studies (27.Yang G. Wu L. Jiang B. Yang W. Qi J. Cao K. Meng Q. Mustafa A.K. Mu W. Zhang S. Snyder S.H. Wang R.

Experiments were conducted in compliance with the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals guidelines and approved by the Animal Care Committee of Lakehead University, Thunder Bay, Canada. All animals were housed in a controlled environment with unlimited access to food and water on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Mice were fed a standard rodent chow diet (Rodent RQ 22-5, Zelgler Bros Inc.). Livers and kidneys were extracted and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Male CSE+/+ and CSE−/− mice (n = 5) were used for the determination of kidney and liver GSH levels at 12–14 weeks of age. MEFs were derived from CSE+/+ and CSE−/− mice by methods previously described (24.Hossain G.S. van Thienen J.V. Werstuck G.H. Zhou J. Sood S.K. Dickhout J.G. de Koning A.B. Tang D. Wu D. Falk E.

Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer containing 100 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1:100 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were disrupted by sonication, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min. Protein concentration of the total cell lysates was determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (29.Bradford M.M.

The relative intensities of protein bands were quantified using Quantity One version 4.6.5 software (Bio-Rad). The Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to measure MEF cell death by detecting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) enzyme activity in the culture medium. Cells were seeded into 6-well plates (1.0 × 106 cells per ml) with DMEM containing 1% FBS and 1× antibiotics. CSE+/+ or CSE−/− MEFs were treated with tunicamycin (Tm; 2 μg/ml, 5 μg/ml) or thapsigargin (Tg; 400 nm, 1 μm) for 24 or 48 h.

https://openalex.org/W2099388546,"The number of high-dimensional datasets recording multiple aspects of a single phenomenon is increasing in many areas of science, accompanied by a need for mathematical frameworks that can compare multiple large-scale matrices with different row dimensions. The only such framework to date, the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), is limited to two matrices. We mathematically define a higher-order GSVD (HO GSVD) for N≥2 matrices D(i)∈R(m(i) × n), each with full column rank. Each matrix is exactly factored as D(i)=U(i)Σ(i)V(T), where V, identical in all factorizations, is obtained from the eigensystem SV=VΛ of the arithmetic mean S of all pairwise quotients A(i)A(j)(-1) of the matrices A(i)=D(i)(T)D(i), i≠j. We prove that this decomposition extends to higher orders almost all of the mathematical properties of the GSVD. The matrix S is nondefective with V and Λ real. Its eigenvalues satisfy λ(k)≥1. Equality holds if and only if the corresponding eigenvector v(k) is a right basis vector of equal significance in all matrices D(i) and D(j), that is σ(i,k)/σ(j,k)=1 for all i and j, and the corresponding left basis vector u(i,k) is orthogonal to all other vectors in U(i) for all i. The eigenvalues λ(k)=1, therefore, define the ""common HO GSVD subspace."" We illustrate the HO GSVD with a comparison of genome-scale cell-cycle mRNA expression from S. pombe, S. cerevisiae and human. Unlike existing algorithms, a mapping among the genes of these disparate organisms is not required. We find that the approximately common HO GSVD subspace represents the cell-cycle mRNA expression oscillations, which are similar among the datasets. Simultaneous reconstruction in the common subspace, therefore, removes the experimental artifacts, which are dissimilar, from the datasets. In the simultaneous sequence-independent classification of the genes of the three organisms in this common subspace, genes of highly conserved sequences but significantly different cell-cycle peak times are correctly classified."
https://openalex.org/W1974436378,"Compounds that delay aging might also postpone age-related diseases and extend healthspan in humans. Icariin is a flavonol extracted from several plant species of the Epimedium family. The icariin and its metabolic derivatives have been shown to exert wide protective effects in age-related diseases. However, whether icariin and its derivatives have the potency of delaying aging remains unclear. Here, we report that icariin and its derivative icariside II extend C. elegans lifespan. Using HPLC, we found high level of icariside II in the animals treated with icariin, suggesting icariside II is the bioactive form in vivo of icariin. Icariside II also increased the thermo and oxidative stress tolerance, slowed locomotion decline in late adulthood and delayed the onset of paralysis mediated by polyQ and Aβ(1-42) proteotoxicity. The lifespan extension effect of icariside II is dependent on the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) since the daf-16(mu86) and daf-2(e1370) failed to show any lifespan extension upon icariside II treatment. Consistently, icariside II treatment upregulates the expression of DAF-16 targets in the wild-type. Moreover, our data suggests that the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 has a role in icariside II-dependent lifespan extension further implicating the IIS pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel natural compound, icariside II as the bioactive form of icariin, extends the healthspan via IIS pathway in C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W1985039814,"The hypoxic and acidic microenvironments in tumors are strongly associated with malignant progression and metastasis, and have thus become a central issue in tumor physiology and cancer treatment. Despite this, the molecular links between acidic pH- and hypoxia-mediated cell invasion/metastasis remain mostly unresolved. One of the mechanisms that tumor cells use for tissue invasion is the generation of invadopodia, which are actin-rich invasive plasma membrane protrusions that degrade the extracellular matrix. Here, we show that hypoxia stimulates the formation of invadopodia as well as the invasive ability of cancer cells. Inhibition or shRNA-based depletion of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE-1, along with intracellular pH monitoring by live-cell imaging, revealed that invadopodia formation is associated with alterations in cellular pH homeostasis, an event that involves activation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchange rate by NHE-1. Further characterization indicates that hypoxia triggered the activation of the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90 RSK), which resulted in invadopodia formation and site-specific phosphorylation and activation of NHE-1. This study reveals an unsuspected role of p90RSK in tumor cell invasion and establishes p90RS kinase as a link between hypoxia and the acidic microenvironment of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1979658694,"3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, commonly known as statins, may possess cancer preventive and therapeutic properties. Statins are effective suppressors of cholesterol synthesis with a well-established risk-benefit ratio in cardiovascular disease prevention. Mechanistically, targeting HMGCR activity primarily influences cholesterol biosynthesis and prenylation of signaling proteins. Pravastatin is a hydrophilic statin that is selectively taken up by a sodium-independent organic anion transporter protein-1B1 (OATP1B1) exclusively expressed in liver. Simvastatin is a hydrophobic statin that enters cells by other mechanisms. Poorly-differentiated and well-differentiated cancer cell lines were selected from various tissues and examined for their response to these two statins. Simvastatin inhibited the growth of most tumor cell lines more effectively than pravastatin in a dose dependent manner. Poorly-differentiated cancer cells were generally more responsive to simvastatin than well-differentiated cancer cells, and the levels of HMGCR expression did not consistently correlate with response to statin treatment. Pravastatin had a significant effect on normal hepatocytes due to facilitated uptake and a lesser effect on prostate PC3 and colon Caco-2 cancer cells since the OATP1B1 mRNA and protein were only found in the normal liver and hepatocytes. The inhibition of cell growth was accompanied by distinct alterations in mitochondrial networks and dramatic changes in cellular morphology related to cofilin regulation and loss of p-caveolin. Both statins, hydrophilic pravastatin and hypdrophobic simvastatin caused redistribution of OATP1B1 and HMGCR to perinuclear sites. In conclusion, the specific chemical properties of different classes of statins dictate mechanistic properties which may be relevant when evaluating biological responses to statins."
https://openalex.org/W1967351582,"Bortezomib (Velcade™) is a reversible proteasome inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Despite its demonstrated clinical success, some patients are deprived of treatment due to primary refractoriness or development of resistance during therapy. To investigate the role of the duration of proteasome inhibition in the anti-tumor response of bortezomib, we established clonal isolates of HT-29 adenocarcinoma cells adapted to continuous exposure of bortezomib. These cells were ∼30-fold resistant to bortezomib. Two novel and distinct mutations in the β5 subunit, Cys63Phe, located distal to the binding site in a helix critical for drug binding, and Arg24Cys, found in the propeptide region were found in all resistant clones. The latter mutation is a natural variant found to be elevated in frequency in patients with MM. Proteasome activity and levels of both the constitutive and immunoproteasome were increased in resistant cells, which correlated to an increase in subunit gene expression. These changes correlated with a more rapid recovery of proteasome activity following brief exposure to bortezomib. Increased recovery rate was not due to increased proteasome turnover as similar findings were seen in cells co-treated with cycloheximide. When we exposed resistant cells to the irreversible proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib we noted a slower rate of recovery of proteasome activity as compared to bortezomib in both parental and resistant cells. Importantly, carfilzomib maintained its cytotoxic potential in the bortezomib resistant cell lines. Therefore, resistance to bortezomib, can be overcome with irreversible inhibitors, suggesting prolonged proteasome inhibition induces a more potent anti-tumor response."
https://openalex.org/W1985557337,"Bordetella spp. form biofilms in the mouse nasopharynx, thereby providing a potential mechanism for establishing chronic infections in humans and animals. Filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is a major virulence factor of B. pertussis, the causative agent of the highly transmissible and infectious disease, pertussis. In this study, we dissected the role of FHA in the distinct biofilm developmental stages of B. pertussis on abiotic substrates and in the respiratory tract by employing a murine model of respiratory biofilms. Our results show that the lack of FHA reduced attachment and decreased accumulation of biofilm biomass on artificial surfaces. FHA contributes to biofilm development by promoting the formation of microcolonies. Absence of FHA from B. pertussis or antibody-mediated blockade of surface-associated FHA impaired the attachment of bacteria to the biofilm community. Exogenous addition of FHA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on bacterial association with the biofilms. Furthermore, we show that FHA is important for the structural integrity of biofilms formed on the mouse nose and trachea. Together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that FHA promotes the formation and maintenance of biofilms by mediating cell-substrate and inter-bacterial adhesions. These discoveries highlight FHA as a key factor in establishing structured biofilm communities in the respiratory tract."

Hence all four species' preferences were ordered in a manner consistent with normative dictates of expected value, but varied predictably in their willingness to take risks."
https://openalex.org/W2059610863,"Pulmonary colonization of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with Burkholderia cenocepacia or other bacteria of the Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is associated with worse prognosis and increased risk of death. During colonization, the bacteria may evolve under the stressing selection pressures exerted in the CF lung, in particular, those resulting from challenges of the host immune defenses, antimicrobial therapy, nutrient availability and oxygen limitation. Understanding the adaptive mechanisms that promote successful colonization and long-term survival of B. cenocepacia in the CF lung is essential for an improved therapeutic outcome of chronic infections. To get mechanistic insights into these adaptive strategies a transcriptomic analysis, based on DNA microarrays, was explored in this study. The genomic expression levels in two clonal variants isolated during long-term colonization of a CF patient who died from the cepacia syndrome were compared. One of the isolates examined, IST439, is the first B. cenocepacia isolate retrieved from the patient and the other isolate, IST4113, was obtained three years later and is more resistant to different classes of antimicrobials. Approximately 1000 genes were found to be differently expressed in the two clonal variants reflecting a marked reprogramming of genomic expression. The up-regulated genes in IST4113 include those involved in translation, iron uptake (in particular, in ornibactin biosynthesis), efflux of drugs and in adhesion to epithelial lung tissue and to mucin. Alterations related with adaptation to the nutritional environment of the CF lung and to an oxygen-limited environment are also suggested to be a key feature of transcriptional reprogramming occurring during long-term colonization, antibiotic therapy and the progression of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2063467367,"Background Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC) is a neurovisceral lipid storage disorder mainly characterized by unesterified cholesterol accumulation in lysosomal/late endosomal compartments, although there is also an important storage for several other kind of lipids. The main tissues affected by the disease are the liver and the cerebellum. Oxidative stress has been described in various NPC cells and tissues, such as liver and cerebellum. Although considerable alterations occur in the liver, the pathological mechanisms involved in hepatocyte damage and death have not been clearly defined. Here, we assessed hepatic tissue integrity, biochemical and oxidative stress parameters of wild-type control (Npc1+/+; WT) and homozygous-mutant (Npc1−/−; NPC) mice. In addition, the mRNA abundance of genes encoding proteins associated with oxidative stress, copper metabolism, fibrosis, inflammation and cholesterol metabolism were analyzed in livers and cerebella of WT and NPC mice. Methodology/Principal Findings We analyzed various oxidative stress parameters in the liver and hepatic and cerebellum gene expression in 7-week-old NPC1-deficient mice compared with control animals. We found signs of inflammation and fibrosis in NPC livers upon histological examination. These signs were correlated with increased levels of carbonylated proteins, diminished total glutathione content and significantly increased total copper levels in liver tissue. Finally, we analyzed liver and cerebellum gene expression patterns by qPCR and microarray assays. We found a correlation between fibrotic tissue and differential expression of hepatic as well as cerebellar genes associated with oxidative stress, fibrosis and inflammation in NPC mice. Conclusions/Significance In NPC mice, liver disease is characterized by an increase in fibrosis and in markers associated with oxidative stress. NPC is also correlated with altered gene expression, mainly of genes involved in oxidative stress and fibrosis. These findings correlate with similar parameters in cerebellum, as has been previously reported in the NPC mice model."
https://openalex.org/W2045997482,"Mammalian spermiogenesis is of considerable biological interest especially due to the unique chromatin remodeling events that take place during spermatid maturation. Here, we have studied the expression of chromatin remodeling factors in different spermatogenic stages and narrowed it down to bromodomain, testis-specific (Brdt) as a key molecule participating in chromatin remodeling during rat spermiogenesis. Our immunocytochemistry experiments reveal that Brdt colocalizes with acetylated H4 in elongating spermatids. Remodeling assays showed an acetylation-dependent but ATP-independent chromatin reorganization property of Brdt in haploid round spermatids. Furthermore, Brdt interacts with Smarce1, a member of the SWI/SNF family. We have studied the genomic organization of smarce1 and identified that it has two splice variants expressed during spermatogenesis. The N terminus of Brdt is involved in the recognition of Smarce1 as well as in the reorganization of hyperacetylated round spermatid chromatin. Interestingly, the interaction between Smarce1 and Brdt increases dramatically upon histone hyperacetylation both in vitro and in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W2171254747,"Cnidarians, including corals and anemones, offer unique insights into metazoan evolution because they harbor genetic similarities with vertebrates beyond that found in model invertebrates and retain genes known only from non-metazoans. Cataloging genes expressed in Acropora palmata, a foundation-species of reefs in the Caribbean and western Atlantic, will advance our understanding of the genetic basis of ecologically important traits in corals and comes at a time when sequencing efforts in other cnidarians allow for multi-species comparisons.A cDNA library from a sample enriched for symbiont free larval tissue was sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Over 960,000 reads were obtained and assembled into 42,630 contigs. Annotation data was acquired for 57% of the assembled sequences. Analysis of the assembled sequences indicated that 83-100% of all A. palmata transcripts were tagged, and provided a rough estimate of the total number genes expressed in our samples (~18,000-20,000). The coral annotation data contained many of the same molecular components as in the Bilateria, particularly in pathways associated with oxidative stress and DNA damage repair, and provided evidence that homologs of p53, a key player in DNA repair pathways, has experienced selection along the branch separating Cnidaria and Bilateria. Transcriptome wide screens of paralog groups and transition/transversion ratios highlighted genes including: green fluorescent proteins, carbonic anhydrase, and oxidative stress proteins; and functional groups involved in protein and nucleic acid metabolism, and the formation of structural molecules. These results provide a starting point for study of adaptive evolution in corals.Currently available transcriptome data now make comparative studies of the mechanisms underlying coral's evolutionary success possible.

The Mongolian Gobi is home to several rare large ungulates such as re-introduced Przewalski's horses (Equus ferus przewalskii) and Asiatic wild asses (Equus hemionus), but also to a millennium-old semi-nomadic livestock herding culture.The Gobi is prone to large inter-annual environmental fluctuations, but the winter 2009/2010 was particularly severe. Millions of livestock died and the Przewalski's horse population in the Gobi crashed. We used spatially explicit livestock loss statistics, ranger survey data and GPS telemetry to provide insight into the effect of a catastrophic climate event on the two sympatric wild equid species and the livestock population in light of their different space use strategies.Herders in and around the Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area lost on average 67% of their livestock. Snow depth varied locally, resulting in livestock losses following an east-west gradient. Herders had few possibilities for evasion, as competition for available winter camps was high. Przewalski's horses used three different winter ranges, two in the east and one in the west. Losses averaged 60%, but differed hugely between east and west. Space use of Przewalski's horses was extremely conservative, as groups did not attempt to venture beyond their known home ranges. Asiatic wild asses seemed to have suffered few losses by shifting their range westwards.The catastrophic winter 2009/2010 provided a textbook example for how vulnerable small and spatially confined populations are in an environment prone to environmental fluctuations and catastrophes. This highlights the need for disaster planning by local herders, multiple re-introduction sites with spatially dispersed populations for re-introduced Przewalski's horses, and a landscape-level approach beyond protected area boundaries to allow for migratory or nomadic movements in Asiatic wild asses."
https://openalex.org/W1984181608,"Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are important for many cellular processes, as they regulate pH by pumping cytosolic protons into intracellular organelles. The cytoplasm is acidified when V-ATPase is inhibited; thus we conducted a high-throughput screen of a chemical library to search for compounds that acidify the yeast cytosol in vivo using pHluorin-based flow cytometry. Two inhibitors, alexidine dihydrochloride (EC(50) = 39 μM) and thonzonium bromide (EC(50) = 69 μM), prevented ATP-dependent proton transport in purified vacuolar membranes. They acidified the yeast cytosol and caused pH-sensitive growth defects typical of V-ATPase mutants (vma phenotype). At concentrations greater than 10 μM the inhibitors were cytotoxic, even at the permissive pH (pH 5.0). Membrane fractions treated with alexidine dihydrochloride and thonzonium bromide fully retained concanamycin A-sensitive ATPase activity despite the fact that proton translocation was inhibited by 80-90%, indicating that V-ATPases were uncoupled. Mutant V-ATPase membranes lacking residues 362-407 of the tether of Vph1p subunit a of V(0) were resistant to thonzonium bromide but not to alexidine dihydrochloride, suggesting that this conserved sequence confers uncoupling potential to V(1)V(0) complexes and that alexidine dihydrochloride uncouples the enzyme by a different mechanism. The inhibitors also uncoupled the Candida albicans enzyme and prevented cell growth, showing further specificity for V-ATPases. Thus, a new class of V-ATPase inhibitors (uncouplers), which are not simply ionophores, provided new insights into the enzyme mechanism and original evidence supporting the hypothesis that V-ATPases may not be optimally coupled in vivo. The consequences of uncoupling V-ATPases in vivo as potential drug targets are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2003416037,"Rho GTPases regulate a diverse range of processes that are dependent on their proper cellular localization. The membrane localization of these GTPases is due in large part to their carboxyl-terminal geranylgeranyl moiety. In addition, most of the Rho family members contain a cluster of positively charged residues (i.e. a ""polybasic domain""), directly preceding their geranylgeranyl moiety, and it has been suggested that this domain serves to fine-tune their localization among different cellular membrane sites. Here, we have taken a closer look at the role of the polybasic domain of Cdc42 in its ability to bind to membranes and induce the transformation of fibroblasts. A FRET assay for the binding of Cdc42 to liposomes of defined composition showed that Cdc42 associates more strongly with liposomes containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)) when compared either with uncharged control membranes or with liposomes containing a charge-equivalent amount of phosphatidylserine. The carboxyl-terminal di-arginine motif (Arg-186 and Arg-187) was shown to play an essential role in the binding of Cdc42 to PIP(2)-containing membranes. We further showed that substitutions for the di-arginine motif, when introduced within a constitutively active (""fast cycling"") Cdc42(F28L) background, had little effect on the ability of the activated Cdc42 mutant to induce microspikes/filopodia in NIH 3T3 cells, whereas they eliminated its ability to transform fibroblasts. Taken together, these findings suggest that the di-arginine motif within the carboxyl terminus of Cdc42 is necessary for this GTPase to bind at membrane sites containing PIP(2), where it can initiate signaling activities that are essential for the oncogenic transformation of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2116897070,"Research on the consequences of witnessing domestic violence has focused on inter-adult violence and most specifically on violence toward mothers. The potential consequences of witnessing violence to siblings have been almost entirely overlooked. Based on clinical experience we sought to test the hypothesis that witnessing violence toward siblings would be as consequential as witnessing violence toward mothers. The community sample consisted of unmedicated, right-handed, young adults who had siblings (n=1,412; 62.7% female; 21.8±2.1 years of age). History of witnessing threats or assaults to mothers, fathers and siblings, exposure to parental and sibling verbal abuse and physical abuse, sexual abuse and sociodemographic factors were assessed by self-report. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatization, anger-hostility, dissociation and 'limbic irritability' were assessed by rating scales. Data were analyzed by multiple regression, with techniques to gauge relative importance; logistic regression to assess adjusted odds ratios for clinically-significant ratings; and random forest regression using conditional trees. Subjects reported witnessing violence to siblings slightly more often than witnessing violence to mothers (22% vs 21%), which overlapped by 51-54%. Witnessing violence toward siblings was associated with significant effects on all ratings. Witnessing violence toward mother was not associated with significant effects on any scale in these models. Measures of the relative importance of witnessing violence to siblings were many fold greater than measures of importance for witnessing violence towards mothers or fathers. Mediation and structural equation models showed that effects of witnessing violence toward mothers or fathers were predominantly indirect and mediated by changes in maternal behavior. The effects of witnessing violence toward siblings were more direct. These findings suggest that greater attention be given to the effects of witnessing aggression toward siblings in studies of domestic violence, abuse and early adversity."

Hpo carrying point mutation M242E can still dimerize, yet the dimers formed between intermolecular kinase domains were altered in conformation. As a result, autophosphorylation of Hpo at Thr-195 was blocked, and its kinase activity was abolished. In contrast, Hpo carrying I634D, a single mutation introduced in the Hpo C-terminal SARAH domain, disrupted the dimerization of the SARAH domain, leading to reduced Hippo activity. We also find that the Hpo C-terminal half contains two nuclear export signals that promote cytoplasmic localization and activity of Hpo. Taken together, our results suggest that dimerization and nucleocytoplasmic translocation of Hpo are crucial for its biological function and indicate that a proper dimer conformation of the kinase domain is essential for Hpo autophosphorylation and kinase activity. The Hippo (Hpo) signaling pathway controls organ size by regulating the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Beginning in 2005, we detected an increase in serotype (ST) 5 and ST8 IPD cases, predominantly in homeless persons living in an open community. Methodology/Principal Findings CASPER (Calgary Area S. pneumoniae Epidemiology Research) surveillance study of all IPD (sterile site isolates) in our region (pop ∼1,100,000). Interviews and chart reviews of all cases and all isolates phenotypically analyzed and selected isolated tested by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Conclusions/Significance During 2005–2007, 162 cases of ST5 IPD and 45 cases of ST8 IPD were identified. The isolates demonstrated phenotypic and genotypic clonality. The ST5 isolates were sequence type (ST) 289 and demonstrated intermediate susceptibility to TMP-SMX. The ST8 isolates were predominantly ST1268, with a susceptible antimicrobial susceptibility profile. Individuals with ST5 IPD were more likely to be middle aged (OR 2.6), homeless (OR 4.4), using illicit drugs(OR 4.8), and asthmatic(OR 2.6). Those with ST8 were more likely to be male (OR 4.4), homeless (OR 2.6), aboriginal (OR7.3), and a current smoker (OR 2.5). Overlapping outbreaks of ST5 and ST8 IPD occurred in an open community in Calgary, Canada and homelessness was a predominant risk factor. Homelessness represents a unique community in which pneumococcal outbreaks can occur."
https://openalex.org/W1969524800,"Human activities have negatively impacted many species, particularly those with unique traits that restrict their use of resources and conditions to specific habitats. Unfortunately, few studies have been able to isolate the individual and combined effects of different threats on population persistence in a natural setting, since not all organisms can be associated with discrete habitat features occurring over limited spatial scales. We present the results of a field study that examines the short-term effects of roost loss in a specialist bat using a conspicuous, easily modified resource. We mimicked roost loss in the natural habitat and monitored individuals before and after the perturbation to determine patterns of resource use, spatial movements, and group stability. Our study focused on the disc-winged bat Thyroptera tricolor, a species highly morphologically specialized for roosting in the developing furled leaves of members of the order Zingiberales. We found that the number of species used for roosting increased, that home range size increased (before: mean 0.14±SD 0.08 ha; after: 0.73±0.68 ha), and that mean association indices decreased (before: 0.95±0.10; after: 0.77±0.18) once the roosting habitat was removed. These results demonstrate that the removal of roosting resources is associated with a decrease in roost-site preferences or selectivity, an increase in mobility of individuals, and a decrease in social cohesion. These responses may reduce fitness by potentially increasing energetic expenditure, predator exposure, and a decrease in cooperative interactions. Despite these potential risks, individuals never used roost-sites other than developing furled leaves, suggesting an extreme specialization that could ultimately jeopardize the long-term persistence of this species' local populations."
https://openalex.org/W2036501108,"Numerous endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-related investigations have been performed in mouse experiments. However, defined characteristics of mouse cultured EPC have not been examined. We focused on fast versus slow adherent cell population in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNCs) in culture and examined their characteristics. After 24 h-culture of BMMNCs, attached (AT) cells and floating (FL) cells were further cultured in endothelial differentiation medium separately. Immunological and molecular analyses exhibited more endothelial-like and less monocyte/macrophage-like characteristics in FL cells compared with AT cells. FL cells formed thick/stable tube and hypoxia or shear stress overload further enhanced these endothelial-like features with increased angiogenic cytokine/growth factor mRNA expressions. Finally, FL cells exhibited therapeutic potential in a mouse myocardial infarction model showing the specific local recruitment to ischemic border zone and tissue preservation. These findings suggest that slow adherent (FL) but not fast attached (AT) BMMNCs in culture are EPC-rich population in mouse."

However, in contrast to vitamin D IGF-1 is not an easily modifiable risk factor. Methods Combining data from the Health Professionals Follow up Study (HPFS) and the Nurses' Health Study cohort (NHS) additive and multiplicative interactions were examined between plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and IGF-1, IGFBP-3 as well as C-peptide levels in 499 cases and 992 matched controls. For the various analytes, being high or low was based on being either above (or equal) or below the medians, respectively. Results Compared to participants with high 25(OH)D and low IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio (reference group), participants with a high IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio were at elevated risk of colorectal cancer when 25(OH)D was low (odds ratio (OR): 2.05 (95% CI: 1.43 to 2.92), but not when 25(OH)D was high (OR:1.20 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.71, p(interaction): additive = 0.06, multiplicative = 0.25). Similarly, compared to participants with high 25(OH)D and low molar IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio and low C-peptide levels (reference group), participants with a combination of either high IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio or high C-peptide were at elevated risk for colorectal cancer when 25(OH)D was low (OR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.22 to 2.94) but not when 25(OH)D was high (OR = 1.15, 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.77, p(interaction): additive = 0.004; multiplicative = 0.04). Conclusion The results from this study suggest that improving vitamin D status may help lower risk of colorectal cancer associated with higher IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio or C-peptide levels."
https://openalex.org/W2024741923,"As biomedical investigators strive to integrate data and analyses across spatiotemporal scales and biomedical domains, they have recognized the benefits of formalizing languages and terminologies via computational ontologies. Although ontologies for biological entities-molecules, cells, organs-are well-established, there are no principled ontologies of physical properties-energies, volumes, flow rates-of those entities. In this paper, we introduce the Ontology of Physics for Biology (OPB), a reference ontology of classical physics designed for annotating biophysical content of growing repositories of biomedical datasets and analytical models. The OPB's semantic framework, traceable to James Clerk Maxwell, encompasses modern theories of system dynamics and thermodynamics, and is implemented as a computational ontology that references available upper ontologies. In this paper we focus on the OPB classes that are designed for annotating physical properties encoded in biomedical datasets and computational models, and we discuss how the OPB framework will facilitate biomedical knowledge integration."
https://openalex.org/W2156843742,"Background The global movement and speciation of fungal plant pathogens is important, especially because of the economic losses they cause and the ease with which they are able to spread across large areas. Understanding the biogeography and origin of these plant pathogens can provide insights regarding their dispersal and current day distribution. We tested the hypothesis of a Gondwanan origin of the plant pathogenic mushroom genus Armillaria and the currently accepted premise that vicariance accounts for the extant distribution of the species. Methods The phylogeny of a selection of Armillaria species was reconstructed based on Maximum Parsimony (MP), Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI). A timeline was then placed on the divergence of lineages using a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approach. Results Phylogenetic analyses of sequenced data for three combined nuclear regions provided strong support for three major geographically defined clades: Holarctic, South American-Australasian and African. Molecular dating placed the initial radiation of the genus at 54 million years ago within the Early Paleogene, postdating the tectonic break-up of Gondwana. Conclusions The distribution of extant Armillaria species is the result of ancient long-distance dispersal rather than vicariance due to continental drift. As these finding are contrary to most prior vicariance hypotheses for fungi, our results highlight the important role of long-distance dispersal in the radiation of fungal pathogens from the Southern Hemisphere."
https://openalex.org/W2004046421,"Cell cycle re-entry during vertebrate oocyte maturation is mediated through translational activation of select target mRNAs, culminating in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) signaling. The temporal order of targeted mRNA translation is crucial for cell cycle progression and is determined by the timing of activation of distinct mRNA-binding proteins.

However, the mechanism by which the initial progesterone-stimulated trigger activates Musashi function is unknown. An immediate early response to progesterone stimulation is the inactivation of Pumilio as a repressor protein and translation of the Pumilio target mRNA encoding Ringo/Speedy, an atypical activator of cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (Cdk1 and Cdk2) (8Padmanabhan K.

Ringo/CDK has been recently shown to mediate direct phosphorylation and inhibition of the Myt1 kinase (an inhibitor of MPF) to facilitate activation of MPF and GVBD (17Ruiz E.J. Hunt T. Nebreda A.R.

Cell. 2008; 32: 210-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A molecular link between Pumilio inactivation and activation of Musashi has not been established, and indeed it has not been clear if translation of the Ringo mRNA impinged upon Musashi activation or if Ringo and Musashi acted in separate pathways leading to MPF activation and GVBD. In this study we determined if translation of the Ringo mRNA mediates Musashi activation in response to progesterone stimulation. Utilizing tandem mass spectrometry, we found that an evolutionarily conserved serine at position 322 (Ser-322) in the Xenopus Musashi1 protein undergoes progesterone-dependent phosphorylation coincident with the initiation of Musashi-dependent mRNA translational activation. We found that preventing phosphorylation of Ser-322 delayed cell cycle re-entry and progression through oocyte maturation. A second conserved site, Ser-297 also contributes to Musashi activation, as abrogation of both Ser-322 and Ser-297 phosphorylation inhibited progesterone-stimulated cell cycle reentry. Conversely, Musashi phospho-mimetic mutants of Ser-297 and Ser-322 accelerate and potentiate cell cycle reentry. We demonstrate that Musashi phosphorylation and activation is initially mediated through Ringo/CDK signaling and is subsequently amplified through MAP kinase signaling as the oocytes progress through the meiotic cell cycle. We further show that mammalian Musashi1 also undergoes regulated phosphorylation and that a phospho-mimetic mutant of mammalian Musashi1 promotes translation of a Musashi target mRNA in NIH3T3 cells. Detailed methodologies employed are described in the supplemental material. Xenopus oocytes were isolated and cultured as described previously (18Machaca K. Haun S. Induction of maturation-promoting factor during Xenopus oocyte maturation uncouples Ca2+ store depletion from store-operated Ca2+ entry.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Oocytes were induced to mature with 2 μg/ml progesterone (19Howard E.L. Charlesworth A. Welk J. MacNicol A.M. The mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway stimulates mos mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation during Xenopus oocyte maturation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1990-1999Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rate of GVBD was scored morphologically by observing the appearance of a white spot on the animal pole. Because oocytes from different frogs mature at different rates in response to progesterone, the culture times were standardized between experiments to the time taken for 50% of oocytes to undergo GVBD. Where indicated, oocytes were pretreated with 50 μm MEK inhibitor, UO126 (Promega), or DMSO vehicle for 30 min. Animal protocols were approved by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Animal Care and Use committee in accordance with Federal regulations. Mammalian NIH3T3 cells were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding Renilla luciferase, firefly luciferase fused to a 3′-UTR containing a Musashi binding element (MBE) designated Fluc-MBE, and either the GST moiety alone, a GST-tagged mammalian Musashi1 (mMsi), or GST-tagged mammalian Musashi1 S337E, essentially as described previously (20MacNicol M.C. Cragle C.E. MacNicol A.M. Context-dependent regulation of Musashi-mediated mRNA translation and cell cycle regulation.Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection the cells were lysed, and samples were prepared for both protein and total RNA analyses. For each protein sample luciferase activity was measured in triplicate with the dual luciferase assay system, and the values were normalized (20MacNicol M.C. Cragle C.E. MacNicol A.M.

Values are shown relative to the firefly luciferase plasmid co-transfected with the GST moiety, arbitrarily set to 100%. Error bars represent S.E. from three independent experiments. Semiquantitative PCR was used to assess the relative levels of Fluc-MBE reporter mRNA expression under each experimental transfection condition. Oocytes were microinjected RNA encoding a GST-tagged form of Xenopus Musashi1, and after an 18-h culture period to allow expression of the introduced Musashi protein, oocytes were split into two pools and either left untreated (time matched control) or stimulated with progesterone (treated). Oocyte lysate was prepared when progesterone oocytes had fully matured. The ectopic Musashi1 protein was recovered over glutathione-Sepharose beads, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie-staining (supplemental Fig. 1). Under these conditions, the GST-Musashi1 protein appeared to undergo a progesterone-dependent mobility shift. Control and treated GST-Musashi1 protein bands were excised, in-gel-digested with 100 ng of GluC, and prepared for MALDI mass spectrometric analysis (21Gradolatto A. Smart S.K. Byrum S. Blair L.P.

After incubation with primary antibody, filters were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody using enhanced chemiluminescence in a Fluorchem 8000 Advanced Imager (Alpha Innotech Corp.). All quantitated data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way analysis of variance followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test or by Student's t test when only two groups were compared. A probability of p < 0.05 was adopted for statistical significance. Although ectopic expression of Musashi1 rescues early class mRNA translation and oocyte maturation in Musashi antisense oligonucleotide-treated oocytes (13Arumugam K. Wang Y. Hardy L.L. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. Enforcing temporal control of maternal mRNA translation during oocyte cell cycle progression.EMBO J. 2010; 29: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), expression of Musashi is not sufficient to rescue maturation in the absence of progesterone stimulation (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that Musashi target mRNAs are not translated in response to Musashi protein synthesis per se but require a progesterone-dependent activation process. To determine whether Musashi is subject to progesterone-stimulated activating phosphorylation, we utilized tandem mass spectrometry to compare Musashi1 protein isolated from immature and from progesterone-stimulated oocytes. In the 60% of the protein sequence covered by the mass spectrometry analysis, we identified a unique site of phosphorylation in progesterone-treated samples that was mapped to serine 322 (Ser-322) of the Xenopus Musashi1 protein (supplemental Fig. 1). We note that this serine residue and the immediate flanking amino acids (AASP) in Xenopus Musashi1 are conserved in mammalian Musashi1 proteins (Fig. 1B). The phosphorylation site is also present in Musashi2 proteins, although with some divergence from Musashi1 in the surrounding amino acids (Fig. 1B). We generated an antibody to a Musashi1 peptide phosphorylated on the Ser-322 residue, and through Western blotting of oocyte lysate we verified that Musashi1 Ser-322 phosphorylation was specific to progesterone-stimulated oocytes (Fig. 1C). The specificity of the antibody was demonstrated through expression of a non-phosphorylatable mutant Musashi1 (where the serine residue was changed to an alanine, S322A), which was not detected with the phospho-specific antiserum in progesterone-stimulated oocytes (Fig. 1C). The phosphorylation of expressed Musashi Ser-322 occurred early in maturation before GVBD, coincident with the initiation of early class Mos mRNA polyadenylation (Fig. 1D). We confirmed that the phosphorylation of endogenous Musashi1 on Ser-322 also increased before GVBD (Fig. 1E). These findings temporally position this modification to mediate activation of Musashi translational control function. To determine the role of Ser-322 phosphorylation in control of Xenopus Musashi function, we expressed the non-phosphorylatable S322A mutant Musashi1 in Musashi antisense oligonucleotide-treated oocytes. In contrast to oocytes expressing wild-type Musashi1, oocytes expressing Musashi1 S322A were significantly compromised for rescue of progesterone-stimulated maturation (Fig. 2A). Conversely, expression of a phospho-mimetic mutant protein (Musashi1 S322E) accelerated the rate of progesterone-stimulated maturation when compared with expression of the wild-type Musashi1 protein (Fig. 2B). This acceleration of cell cycle progression correlated with an increase in the rate and extent of polyadenylation and translation of the Musashi target mRNA, Mos (Fig. 2, C and D). We conclude that progesterone-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-322 contributes to the activation of Musashi function, resulting in target mRNA translation and oocyte maturation. We next sought to identify the progesterone-stimulated signaling pathway responsible for Musashi Ser-322 phosphorylation. The Ser-322 residue is located within a consensus motif for a proline-directed kinase, such as MAP kinase. However, Mos, the primary MAP kinase activator in oocytes (27Nebreda A.R. Hunt T.

Musashi regulates the temporal order of mRNA translation during Xenopus oocyte maturation.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2792-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been previously shown that treatment of oocytes with the MAP kinase signaling inhibitor UO126 does not prevent initial polyadenylation or translation of the Mos mRNA (5Charlesworth A.

Ectopic expression of Ringo is sufficient to drive oocyte maturation and translational activation of the Mos mRNA independently of progesterone stimulation (8Padmanabhan K. Richter J.D.

We observed that inhibition of Musashi function, through expression of a dominant inhibitory form of Musashi (N-Msi (5Charlesworth A. Wilczynska A. Thampi P. Cox L.L. MacNicol A.M.

No polyadenylation of the Mos mRNA occurred even after the delayed maturation in Ringo injected oocytes (Fig. 3A, right panel). Consistent with Musashi functioning downstream of Ringo, we note that inhibition of Musashi function with N-Msi did not affect the upstream process of progesterone-stimulated accumulation of Ringo protein (supplemental Fig. 2). Ectopic expression of Ringo was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Musashi on Ser-322 independently of progesterone stimulation (Fig. 3B). Ringo-induced Musashi Ser-322 phosphorylation occurred before GVBD, consistent with the timing of progesterone-stimulated Musashi Ser-322 phosphorylation (Fig. 1). Conversely, pretreatment of oocytes with Ringo antisense oligonucleotides blocked progesterone-induced Musashi Ser-322 phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). We conclude that Ringo/CDK is necessary and sufficient to mediate Musashi activation before GVBD. We determined that Ringo-induced Musashi Ser-322 phosphorylation specifically required CDK activity, as a mutant Ringo (D83A) that fails to bind and activate CDK (31Cheng A. Xiong W.

Latitudinal variation in this gene may hence reflect local adaptation to seasonal variation. In some bird populations, there is also an among-individual association between Clock poly-Q genotype and clutch initiation date and incubation period. We examined Clock poly-Q allele variation in the Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica), a species with a cosmopolitan geographic distribution and considerable variation in life-history traits that may be influenced by the circadian clock. We genotyped Barn Swallows from five populations (from three subspecies) and compared variation at the Clock locus to that at microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). We found very low variation in the Clock poly-Q region, as >96% of individuals were homozygous, and the two other alleles at this locus were globally rare. Genetic differentiation based on the Clock poly-Q locus was not correlated with genetic differentiation based on either microsatellite loci or mtDNA sequences. Our results show that high diversity in Clock poly-Q is not general across avian species. The low Clock variation in the background of heterogeneity in microsatellite and mtDNA loci in Barn Swallows may be an outcome of stabilizing selection on the Clock locus."

This study determined the activation of lymphocytes and drift of helper T (Th) subsets induced by RSV-infected human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) in vitro. HBECs had prolonged infection with RSV, and lymphocytes isolated from human peripheral blood were co-cultured with RSV-infected HBECs. Four groups were established, as follows: lymphocytes (group L); lymphocytes infected with RSV (group RL); co-culture of lymphocytes with non-infected HBECs (group HL); and co-culture of lymphocytes with infected HBECs (group HRL). After co-culture with HBECs for 24 hours, lymphocytes were collected and the following were determined in the 4 groups: cell cycle status; apoptosis rate; and concentrations of IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in the supernatants. Cell cycle analysis for lymphocytes showed a significant increase in S phase cells, a decrease in G1 phase cells, and a higher apoptosis rate in group HRL compared with the other three groups. In group HRL, the levels of IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-17 in supernatants were also higher than the other three groups. For further study, lymphocytes were individually treated with supernatants from non-infected and RSV-infected HBECs for 24 h. We showed that supernatants from RSV-infected HBECs induced the differentiation of Th2 and Th17 subsets, and suppressed the differentiation of Treg subsets. Our results showed that HBECs with prolonged RSV infection can induce lymphocyte proliferation and apoptosis, and enhance the release of cytokines by lymphocytes. Moreover, subset drift might be caused by RSV-infected HBECs."

The objective of this work was to study the impact of lactose and lactose permease on S. thermophilus physiology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of gnotobiotic rats. We used rats mono-associated with LMD-9 strain and receiving 4.5% lactose. This model allowed the analysis of colonization curves of LMD-9, its metabolic profile, its production of lactate and its interaction with the colon epithelium. Lactose induced a rapid and high level of S. thermophilus in the GIT, where its activity led to 49 mM of intra-luminal L-lactate that was related to the induction of mono-carboxylic transporter mRNAs (SLC16A1 and SLC5A8) and p27(Kip1) cell cycle arrest protein in epithelial cells. In the presence of a continuous lactose supply, S. thermophilus recruited proteins involved in glycolysis and induced the metabolism of alternative sugars as sucrose, galactose, and glycogen. Moreover, inactivation of the lactose transporter, LacS, delayed S. thermophilus colonization. Our results show i/that lactose constitutes a limiting factor for colonization of S. thermophilus, ii/that activation of enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism constitutes the metabolic signature of S. thermophilus in the GIT, iii/that the production of lactate settles the dialogue with colon epithelium. We propose a metabolic model of management of carbohydrate resources by S. thermophilus in the GIT. Our results are in accord with the rationale that nutritional allegation via consumption of yogurt alleviates the symptoms of lactose intolerance."
https://openalex.org/W2028016637,"Brucella melitensis is an important zoonotic pathogen that causes brucellosis, a disease that affects sheep, cattle and occasionally humans. B. melitensis strain M5-90, a live attenuated vaccine cultured from B. melitensis strain M28, has been used as an effective tool in the control of brucellosis in goats and sheep in China. However, the molecular changes leading to attenuated virulence and pathogenicity in B. melitensis remain poorly understood. In this study we employed the Illumina Genome Analyzer platform to perform genome-wide digital gene expression (DGE) analysis of mouse peritoneal macrophage responses to B. melitensis infection. Many parallel changes in gene expression profiles were observed in M28- and M5-90-infected macrophages, suggesting that they employ similar survival strategies, notably the induction of anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic factors. Moreover, 1019 differentially expressed macrophage transcripts were identified 4 h after infection with the different B. melitensis strains, and these differential transcripts notably identified genes involved in the lysosome and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Further analysis employed gene ontology (GO) analysis: high-enrichment GOs identified endocytosis, inflammatory, apoptosis, and transport pathways. Path-Net and Signal-Net analysis highlighted the MAPK pathway as the key regulatory pathway. Moreover, the key differentially expressed genes of the significant pathways were apoptosis-related. These findings demonstrate previously unrecognized changes in gene transcription that are associated with B. melitensis infection of macrophages, and the central signaling pathways identified here merit further investigation. Our data provide new insights into the molecular attenuation mechanism of strain M5-90 and will facilitate the generation of new attenuated vaccine strains with enhanced efficacy."

Methods T-cell responses to Rv3873, Rv3878 and Rv3879c were quantified by IFN-γ-enzyme-linked-immunospot (ELISpot) in 846 children with recent household tuberculosis exposure and correlated with kinetics of tuberculin skin test (TST) and ESAT-6/CFP-10-ELISpot conversion over six months and clinical outcome over two years. Results Responses to Rv3873, Rv3878, and Rv3879c were present in 20–25% of contacts at enrolment. Rv3873 and Rv3879c responses were associated with and preceded TST conversion (P = 0.02 and P = 0.04 respectively), identifying these antigens as early targets of cell-mediated immunity following M. tuberculosis exposure. Responses to Rv3873 were additionally associated with subsequent ESAT-6/CFP-10-ELISpot conversion (P = 0.04). Responses to Rv3873 and Rv3878 predicted progression to active disease (adjusted incidence rate ratio [95% CI] 3.06 [1.05,8.95; P = 0.04], and 3.32 [1.14,9.71; P = 0.03], respectively). Presence of a BCG-vaccination scar was associated with a 67% (P = 0.03) relative risk reduction for progression to active tuberculosis. Conclusions These RD1-derived antigens are early targets of cellular immunity following tuberculosis exposure and T-cells specific for these antigens predict progression to active tuberculosis suggesting diagnostic and prognostic utility."

The transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-κB) is a key regulator of genes involved in M-CSF-induced mononuclear phagocyte survival and this study focused at identifying the mechanism of NF-κB transcriptional activation. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF stimulated NF-κB transcriptional activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. The general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor Ro-31-8220, the conventional PKCα/β inhibitor Gö-6976, overexpression of dominant negative PKCα constructs and PKCα siRNA reduced NF-κB activity in response to M-CSF. Interestingly, Ro-31-8220 reduced Ser276 phosphorylation of NF-κBp65 leading to decreased M-CSF-induced monocyte survival. In this report, we identify conventional PKCs, including PKCα as important upstream kinases for M-CSF-induced NF-κB transcriptional activation, NF-κB-regulated gene expression, NF-κB p65 Ser276 phosphorylation, and macrophage survival. Lastly, we find that NF-κB p65 Ser276 plays an important role in basal and M-CSF-stimulated NF-κB activation in human mononuclear phagocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2091502779,"Studies examining human and nonhuman primates have supported the hypothesis that the recent increase in the occurrence of misalignment of teeth and/or incorrect relation of dental arches, named dental malocclusion, is mainly attributed to the availability of a more processed diet and the reduced need for powerful masticatory action. For the first time on live human populations, genetic and tooth wear influences on occlusal variation were examined in a split indigenous population. The Arara-Iriri people are descendants of a single couple expelled from a larger village. In the resultant village, expansion occurred through the mating of close relatives, resulting in marked genetic cohesion with substantial genetic differences.Dental malocclusion, tooth wear and inbreeding coefficient were evaluated. The sample examined was composed of 176 individuals from both villages. Prevalence Ratio and descriptive differences in the outcomes frequency for each developmental stage of the dentition were considered. Statistical differences between the villages were examined using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact statistic. Tooth wear and the inbreeding coefficient (F) between the villages was tested with Mann-Whitney statistics. All the statistics were performed using two-tailed distribution at p≤0.05. The coefficient inbreeding (F) confirmed the frequent incestuous unions among the Arara-Iriri indigenous group. Despite the tooth wear similarities, we found a striking difference in occlusal patterns between the two Arara villages. In the original village, dental malocclusion was present in about one third of the population; whilst in the resultant village, the occurrence was almost doubled. Furthermore, the morphological characteristics of malocclusion were strongly different between the groups.Our findings downplay the widespread influence of tooth wear, a direct evidence of what an individual ate in the past, on occlusal variation of living human populations. They also suggest that genetics plays the most important role on dental malocclusion etiology."

Between the fimbrial types, the pairwise nucleotide diversity for the pilin or adhesin genes ranged from 35–43%.

Such pathoadaptive mutations represent an alternative mechanism of virulence evolution, complementing horizontal gene transfer. Here, we investigated the natural population diversity of the adhesin and pilin subunits of representative fimbriae of subclasses 5a (CFA/I), 5b (CS17), and 5c (CS2). Our findings underscore common themes in microevolution of fimbrial adhesins from different pathotypes of E. coli. The ETEC strains used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Isolates originally came from Africa (n = 24), Asia (n = 24), Latin America (n = 9), Europe (n = 6), the Middle East (n = 5), and the United States (n = 1). The strains individually expressed CFA/I (n = 31), CS17 (n = 20), and CS2 (n = 18). All strains for which pre-existing E. coli serotype data were not available were serotyped using traditional methods. All ETEC strains included in this study have been identified previously by their expression of heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and/or heat-stable enterotoxin I (STI). Further discrimination of STI genotype into estA1 (STIa or STp) and estA2 (STIb or STh) was performed by PCR analysis of plasmid preparations using the primer pairs and conditions described in supplemental Table S2. DNA sequences of the major and minor subunit genes for CFA/I (cfaB, cfaE) were determined by direct sequence analysis of wild type plasmid preparations using the primers listed in supplemental Table S3. Sequence analysis of the same genes for CS17 (csbA, csbD) and CS2 fimbriae (cotA, cotD) was performed on amplicons generated by PCR using forward and reverse primers that annealed 5′ and 3′ to each open reading frame (supplemental Table S3). Using the same primers, and additional internal primers for the adhesin genes csbD and cotD, both strands of each amplicon were sequenced using an ABI Prism BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing kit. Products were purified and sequence was analyzed on an ABI Prism 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Sequences were assembled using Sequencher software (version 4.10) (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, MI). Multilocus sequence type (MLST) analysis was performed using four housekeeping genes, fumC and gyrB from the E. coli MLST database maintained at the University College Cork and uidA and fadD from the EcMLST database at Michigan State University (23.Wirth T.

Internal fragments of these four genes were amplified and sequenced from all isolates using the primers and methods shown in supplemental Table S4.

Sequence diversity was measured by the average pairwise diversity index (π) and the rates of nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) mutations (26.Nei M. Gojobori T.

Analysis of statistical significance was performed using the z-test for π and dN/dS values (28.Suzuki Y. Gojobori T. Salemi M. Vandamme A.-M.

The presence of structural hotspot mutations was determined using zonal phylogeny software (29.Chattopadhyay S. Dykhuizen D.E. Sokurenko E.V. ZPS: Visualization of recent adaptive evolution of proteins.BMC Bioinformatics. 2007; 8: 187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Wild type colonization factor antigen (CFA)/I fimbriae were purified from ETEC strains WS1933D (primary CfaE), WS4437A-1 (CfaE/A128V), SMJ344 (CfaE/Q142R), 10F2 (CfaE/T91I), 27D (CfaB/A37V), and NN-10-1-1 (CfaB/A37V,S136T), each representative of a different CfaB or CfaE allotype defined in this work. CS2 was produced from strain C91f. For production of CFA/I and CS2 fimbriae, ETEC strains were grown at 37 °C overnight on colonization factor antigen (CFA) agar (30.Evans D.G. Evans Jr., D.J. Tjoa W. Hemagglutination of human group A erythrocytes by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli isolated from adults with diarrhea: Correlation with colonization factor.Infect. Immun. 1977; 18: 330-337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial lawns were harvested and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Suspensions were heat treated (65 °C, 25 min) and centrifuged. The supernatant was decanted, and fimbriae were precipitated in 40% ammonium sulfate, followed by overnight dialysis against PBS. CS17 fimbriae were purified from ETEC strains LSN02-013966/A (primary CsbD), WS4228E (CsbD/A144H), LSN03-016011/A (CsbD/Y293H,N62R), WS6788A (CsbD/A144H,I85L), DS37-4 (CsbD/N62S,Y293H,T84N,I85R,Y145N), and E20738/0 (CsbD/N62S,Y293H,T84N,I85R,Y145N,S74T), representing each of six different CsbD allotypes defined in this work. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C overnight on CFA agar supplemented with 1.5 g/liter bile salts (BD Diagnostics, Sparks, MD). Heat extracts of bacterial surface proteins were prepared as described above for CFA/I and CS2. CS17 purification involved serial MgCl2 precipitation as described previously (31.Bullitt E. Makowski L. Bacterial adhesion pili are heterologous assemblies of similar subunits.Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 623-632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).

Protein structure prediction on the Web: A case study using the Phyre server.Nature Protocols. 2009; 4: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (3573) Google Scholar) was implemented to generate a three-dimensional atomic model of CsbD based on the available CfaE crystal structure (13.Li Y.F. Poole S. Rasulova F. McVeigh A.L. Savarino S.J. Xia D. A receptor-binding site as revealed by the crystal structure of CfaE, the colonization factor antigen I fimbrial adhesin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.J. Biol.

The resolved structures of CfaE and FimH and the predicted CsbD structure were viewed using PyMOL to calculate distances with reference to the Cα atom of each mutation that increases mannose (FimH) or erythrocyte binding (CsbD). Using a cut-off of 4 Å, distances of each mutated position from the nearest amino acid in the binding pocket and in the interdomain interface were measured. Then each of the two distances was normalized by dividing by the distance between the corresponding binding pocket and interdomain interface residues, to eliminate any bias of length differences among CfaE, CsbD, and FimH proteins in the analysis. Polystyrene tissue culture plates were coated with proteins in 0.02 m NaHCO3 buffer for 1 h at 37 °C. Protein concentrations for purified fimbriae were 100 μg/ml (33.Tchesnokova V. Aprikian P. Yakovenko O. Larock C. Kidd B. Vogel V. Thomas W. Sokurenko E. Integrin-like allosteric properties of the catch bond-forming FimH adhesin of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 7823-7833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To avoid nonspecific binding of bovine erythrocytes to BSA, plates were quenched with 0.1 mg/ml of non-binding FimH mutant type 1 fimbriae preparation in PBS. A parallel plate flow chamber (PPFC) (GlycoTech, Gaithersburg, MD) was assembled over the plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. The assembly was mounted on a Nikon TE200 inverted microscope with a 10× phase-contrast objective. Experiments were recorded using a Roper Scientific high resolution CCD camera and MetaMorph® or MetaView® (Universal Imaging CorporationTM) video acquisition software. All additional experiments were performed in 0.2% BSA-PBS buffer with 0.5% α-methyl d-mannopyranoside. Bovine erythrocytes were washed at least twice and were resuspended at 0.04% before use. Erythrocyte suspensions were manually loaded into assembled PPFC and allowed to settle for 4 min. The recording was started, and buffer was driven into the chamber using a Harvard syringe pump at varied flow rates to produce the desired wall shear rates. Erythrocyte movement was recorded at two frames per second with 100-ms shutter time to distinguish cells that were moving at speeds slower than hydrodynamic velocity. The recording time varied depending on the period of delay for each shear rate. Recorded movies were analyzed in three steps. First, settled erythrocytes were counted before establishing flow. Second, after in-chamber flow was initiated, erythrocytes that were in focus (i.e. moving slower than hydrodynamic velocity) were counted in several sequential frames. Finally, these counts were used to calculate the average percent of erythrocytes that stayed near the surface (i.e. bound erythrocytes). Each experiment was repeated at least twice using different protein and erythrocyte batches. Velocities of moving erythrocytes were calculated either from the accumulation movies as the distance covered by the erythrocyte within a given time period, or from the recording in stream video mode (1 frame per 37 ms) using the tracking object mode of Metamorph software. The velocity of every cell in the field of view was determined, and the average velocity with standard errors was calculated from the velocities of ∼100 cells within the same video. Purified CFA/I fimbriae in bicarbonate buffer at pH 9.6 (0.1 mg/ml) were coated in 96-well microtiter plates for 1 h at 37 °C. The immobilized fimbriae were quenched with 0.2% BSA in PBS and probed with 1:1000 diluted mouse anti-CfaE monoclonal antibody (P10A7) followed by incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:3000). The colorimetric reaction was developed with a 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine. OD was measured at 650 nm. MLST analysis was performed on the 69 ETEC strains and also applied to 21 reference E. coli and Shigella strains using available genome sequences (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table S5). These ETEC strains partitioned into 16 sequence types (assigned as ETEC1 to ETEC16), among which the pairwise nucleotide diversity averaged 0.5 ± 0.07%. This compared with a 3-fold higher diversity among the reference strains (1.4 ± 0.17%). Some clades were composed of distinct ETEC STs, whereas others contained a mixture of ETEC, other diarrheagenic E. coli pathotypes and non-pathogenic (fecal) isolates (Fig. 1). ETEC strains were confined to the previously described major phylogenetic groups A, B1, A×B1. None fell within the clonally distinct B2 and D groups, where most extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli are found. All but one of the CS2-ETEC strains were clonally related and shared the O16 serogroup. The one unrelated CS2-ETEC, M145C2, had a different serogroup (O128ab). In contrast, ETEC strains carrying CFA/I or CS17 genes were clonally diverse. Some strains expressing the same fimbrial type belonged to separate clades, whereas some strains individually expressing CFA/I and CS17 belonged to closely related or even the same sequence type (ST) (Fig. 1), suggesting frequent horizontal movement of the different types of class 5 fimbrial genes between ETEC strains. The structural genes of the three fimbrial types were similar in length (Table 1), but their sequences were divergent, with nucleotide diversity ranging from 38–43% (188–213 pairwise nucleotide changes) and 35–39% (361–401 pairwise nucleotide changes) for the pilin and adhesin genes, respectively (Fig. 2). The average rates of non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) mutations between primary alleles of the pilin (dN = 0.42 ± 0.03, dS = 1.87 ± 0.23) and adhesin genes (dN = 0.54 ± 0.03, dS = 0.85 ± 0.03) were considerably higher than the corresponding values for the housekeeping genes (dN = 0.001 ± 0.0004, dS = 0.03 ± 0.0042). For the housekeeping genes, dN was significantly lower than dS (dN/dS = 0.03, p < 0.0001), indicating strong purifying selection against structural changes. In contrast, for the class 5 fimbrial genes, the ratio of dN/dS for the pilin (dN/dS = 0.22) and adhesin genes (dN/dS = 0.64) was greater. In several regions across the pilin and adhesin genes, this ratio exceeded 1, likely due to positive selection for structural changes.TABLE 1Nucleotide diversity analysis of fimbrial genes from three groups of ETEC strains expressing different class 5 CF-typesClass 5 CF-type/GeneSequence lengthNo. of allelesNo. of mutations (ns/syn)aNs and syn denote non-synonymous and synonymous mutations, respectively.dN/dSp valuebp value denotes the probability of dN to be higher than dS (based on z-test).bpCFA/IcfaB51032/00.0035/0.00.134cfaE108043/00.0018/0.00.072CS17csbA5041csbD1089812/10.0053/0.00100.057CS2cotA5101cotD10921a Ns and syn denote non-synonymous and synonymous mutations, respectively.b p value denotes the probability of dN to be higher than dS (based on z-test). Open table in a new tab In contrast to the high diversity of pilin and adhesin genes between discrete fimbrial types, within a single fimbrial type there was nominal or no sequence variability (Fig. 2, A and B, solid line branches). For CS2, all cotA pilin and cotD adhesin gene sequences were identical. For CFA/I, there were three separate alleles of cfaB (pilin) with an average pairwise change of 1.33 ± 0.87 nucleotides (0.3% diversity). There were four alleles of cfaE (adhesin) with an average pairwise change of 1.50 ± 0.88 nucleotides (1.4% diversity). For CS17, csbA (pilin) was invariant, whereas csbD (adhesin) divided into eight alleles with an average pairwise change of 4.64 ± 1.35 nucleotides (0.4% diversity). Strikingly, within fimbrial types, all but one of a combined 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms were non-synonymous. For individual genes, the low number of alleles precluded analysis of differences in dN over dS. However, for concatenated loci dN was significantly above dS (p < 0.0001), the dN/dS ratio of 8.4 indicating strong positive selection for amino acid replacements. Additionally, multiple independent mutations conferring different amino acid changes were localized to codons 62 and 85 of csbD. Occurrence of these structural hotspot mutations provides further evidence of positive selection for structural changes (34.Hughes A.L. Nei M.

Crystal structures show that the CfaB pilin folds into a single domain (Fig. 3A), whereas CfaE features two domains, a lectin or adhesin domain with a putative receptor-binding site and a pilin domain anchoring the tip adhesin to the fimbrial shaft (Fig. 3B) (11.Li Y.F.

The two observed amino acid changes in CfaB, A37V and T136S, were spatially localized to the interface between CfaB and the pilin domain of CfaE (Fig. 3A). The three residue changes noted in CfaE, T91I, A128V, and Q142R, were all localized to the putative lectin domain of the adhesin, clustered on the upper loops that are predicted to form the ligand-binding pocket (Fig. 3B). In CsbD (CS17 fimbrial adhesin), the 12 non-synonymous nucleotide mutations resulted in a total of 10 amino acid changes (two codons were affected by two separate mutations each). Seven changes accumulated within a stretch of 24 amino acids (N62S/S62R, S74T, T84N, and I85V/I85L/I85R). Two other changes (A144H and Y145N) targeted adjacent positions, indicating significant clustering of mutations (p < 0.0001). One CsbD change (Y29"

We carried out a systematic assessment of the quality of maternal and newborn care in three CEE/CIS countries, using an innovative approach to identify priority issues and promote action.A standard-based tool, covering over 400 items grouped in 13 main areas ranging from support services to case management, was used to assess a sample of ten maternity hospitals in Albania, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Sources of information were visit to services, medical records, observation of cases, and interviews with staff and mothers. A score (range 0 to 3) was attributed to each item and area of care. The assessment was carried out by a multidisciplinary team of international and national professionals. Local managers and staff provided the necessary information and were involved in discussing the findings and the priority actions.Quality of care was found to be substandard in all 13 areas. The lowest scores (between one and two) were obtained by: management of normal labour, delivery, obstetric complications and sick babies; infection prevention; use of guidelines and audits; monitoring and follow-up. Neonatal care as a whole scored better than obstetric care. Interviewed mothers identified lack of information, insufficient support during labour and lack of companionship as main issues. Actions to improve quality of care were identified at facility as well as at central level and framed according to main health system functions.Quality of care is a key issue to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, particularly in countries such as CEE/CIS where access to institutional births is nearly universal. Approaches that involve health professionals and managers in comprehensive, action-oriented assessments of quality of care are promising and should be further supported."
https://openalex.org/W2159300595,"Without having direct access to the information that is being exchanged, traces of information flow can be obtained by looking at temporal sequences of user interactions. These sequences can be represented as causality trees whose statistics result from a complex interplay between the topology of the underlying (social) network and the time correlations among the communications. Here, we study causality trees in mobile-phone data, which can be represented as a dynamical directed network. This representation of the data reveals the existence of super-spreaders and super-receivers. We show that the tree statistics, respectively the information spreading process, are extremely sensitive to the in-out degree correlation exhibited by the users. We also learn that a given information, e.g., a rumor, would require users to retransmit it for more than 30 hours in order to cover a macroscopic fraction of the system. Our analysis indicates that topological node-node correlations of the underlying social network, while allowing the existence of information loops, they also promote information spreading. Temporal correlations, and therefore causality effects, are only visible as local phenomena and during short time scales. Consequently, the very idea that there is (intentional) information spreading beyond a small vecinity is called into question. These results are obtained through a combination of theory and data analysis techniques."

The amino acid residues that affect A2 domain dissociation are therefore critical for FVIII cofactor function. We have now employed chemical footprinting in conjunction with mass spectrometry to identify lysine residues that contribute to the stability of activated FVIII. We hypothesized that lysine residues, which are buried in FVIII and surface-exposed in dissociated activated FVIII (dis-FVIIIa), may contribute to interdomain interactions. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that residues Lys1967 and Lys1968 of region Thr1964-Tyr1971 are buried in FVIII and exposed to the surface in dis-FVIIIa. This result, combined with the observation that the FVIII variant K1967I is associated with hemophilia A, suggests that these residues contribute to the stability of activated FVIII. Kinetic analysis revealed that the FVIII variants K1967A and K1967I exhibit an almost normal cofactor activity. However, these variants also showed an increased loss in cofactor activity over time compared with that of FVIII WT. Remarkably, the cofactor activity of a K1968A variant was enhanced and sustained for a prolonged time relative to that of FVIII WT. Surface plasmon resonance analysis demonstrated that A2 domain dissociation from activated FVIII was reduced for K1968A and enhanced for K1967A.

The A domains are homologous to the A domains of ceruloplasmin, the C domains to those of discoidin, and the B domain is unique to FVIII. a1, a2, and a3 are spacer regions that are rich in acidic amino acid residues (3.Church W.R. Jernigan R.L. Toole J. Hewick R.M. Knopf J. Knutson G.J. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Fass D.N. Coagulation factors V and VIII and ceruloplasmin constitute a family of structurally related proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1984; 81: 6934-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Because of limited proteolysis of the B domain, FVIII circulates in plasma as a heterogeneous protein of which the light chain is noncovalently linked to the heavy chain (1.Fay P.J. Factor VIII structure and function.Int. J. Hematol. 2006; 83: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). factor VIII activated FVIII collision-induced dissociation dissociated FVIIIa activated factor IX factor X activated FX higher energy CID response units tandem mass tag. FVIII is found in plasma in a tight complex with its carrier protein von Willebrand factor (4.Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. Association of the factor VIII light chain with von Willebrand factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of von Willebrand factor is to protect FVIII from rapid clearance from the circulation and to prevent premature binding of FVIII to its ligands (5.Lillicrap D.

Proteolytic cleavage between a3 and the A3 domain by thrombin results in the dissociation of the FVIII-von Willebrand factor complex (4.Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. Association of the factor VIII light chain with von Willebrand factor.J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additional cleavages by thrombin between a1 and the A2 domain, and between a2 and the B domain, are required to convert FVIII into the activated heterotrimeric protein (FVIIIa) (7.Duffy E.J.

FVIIIa subsequently binds via its C1 domain and C2 domain to phosphatidylserine-containing procoagulant surfaces thereby forming a platform for high affinity interaction with FIXa (1.Fay P.J.

Several mechanisms have been proposed that may drive this inactivation. One mechanism involves proteolytic cleavage of FVIIIa by activated protein C. It has been proposed that activated protein C inactivates FVIIIa through proteolytic cleavages in the A1 and A2 domain (11.Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J.

It has also been shown that FIXa, FXa, and plasmin are able to cleave FVIIIa inducing inactivation of the cofactor (13.Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A.

Apart from protease-assisted inactivation of the cofactor, spontaneous dissociation of the A2-a2 domain from the A1-a1/A3-C1-C2 dimer also leads to dampening of the activity of the FXa-generating complex (17.Lollar P.

It has been demonstrated that residues that control the dissociation rate of the A2-a2 domain from A1-a1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, and as such affect the stability of FVIIIa, are of critical importance for cofactor function (20.Gale A.J.

For a number of hemophilia A variants carrying single amino acid substitutions, it has been suggested that a decreased stability of FVIIIa is the cause for the bleeding disorder (21.Wakabayashi H.

Employing molecular modeling studies on the available FVIII structures in combination with site-directed mutagenesis, Fay and co-workers have now successfully identified several amino acid residues that enhance or decrease the stability of FVIII (21.Wakabayashi H.

The recently solved crystal structures of FVIII have also assisted the biochemical studies addressing FVIIIa stability (26.Ngo J.C. Huang M. Roth D.A. Furie B.C. Furie B.

The tertiary structure and domain organization of coagulation factor VIII.Blood. 2008; 111: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). They have, for instance, served as a basis for molecular dynamics studies from which conclusions have been drawn about the critical contacts between the individual FVIII domains (28.Venkateswarlu D. Structural investigation of zymogenic and activated forms of human blood coagulation factor VIII: a computational molecular dynamics study.BMC Struct. Biol. 2010; 10: 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Yet, a limitation of the crystal structures is their relatively low resolution. We have now employed chemical footprinting in conjunction with mass spectrometry to identify lysine residues that contribute to FVIIIa stability. We hypothesized that those lysine residues, which are buried in FVIII and not in dissociated FVIIIa (dis-FVIIIa), may contribute to the interaction between the A2-a2 domain and the A1-a1/A3-C1-C2 dimer. To identify these residues, we took advantage of the notion that buried lysine residues are less prone to chemical modification than those that are exposed to the protein surface (29.Shkriabai N. Datta S.A. Zhao Z. Hess S. Rein A. Kvaratskhelia M. Interactions of HIV-1 Gag with assembly cofactors.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 4077-4083Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The lysines with the largest change in surface exposure upon FVIIIa dissociation were therefore evaluated for their contribution to the stability of FVIIIa. HEPES was from SERVA (Heidelberg, Germany), NaCl was from FAGRON (Rotterdam, The Netherlands) and Tris-HCl from Invitrogen. All other fine chemicals were from Merck. Monoclonal antibodies EL14, KM33, and CLB-CAg 9 have been described previously (30.Meems H. Meijer A.B. Cullinan D.B. Mertens K. Gilbert G.E.

B domain-deleted FVIII and the FVIII variants thereof have been constructed and purified as described (10.Meems H. van den Biggelaar M. Rondaij M. van der Zwaan C. Mertens K. Meijer A.B. C1 domain residues Lys2092 and Phe2093 are of major importance for the endocytic uptake of coagulation factor VIII.Int. J. Biochem.

Intracellular cotrafficking of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor type 2N variants to storage organelles.Blood. 2009; 113: 3102-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with the exception that FVIII was stored in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.8 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 50% glycerol. Plasma-derived FVIII was purified from Aafact (Sanquin, Amsterdam) according to the same procedure. To this end, Aafact was taken up in 50 mm imidazole (pH 6.7), 50 mm CaCl2, and 0.8 m NaCl prior to purification. The purification of FX, FIXa, and thrombin is described by Mertens and Bertina (34.Mertens K. Bertina R.M. Pathways in the activation of human coagulation factor X.Biochem. J. 1980; 185: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). FXa was from Enzyme Research (South Bend, IN). 70 nm plasma-derived FVIII was incubated with 2 nm thrombin in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 for 2 h at 37 °C to ensure dissociation. Thrombin activation was terminated by the addition of 1.6 units/ml hirudin. FVIII was chemically modified by tandem mass tag (TMT)-127 for 2 h at 37 °C (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to instructions of the manufacturer for labeling whole proteins. 100 mm lysine dissolved in 140 mm Tris-HCl was employed to stop the reaction. To label nonactivated FVIII with TMT-126, FVIII was first incubated with hirudin and then with thrombin prior to the addition of TMT-126. The TMT-labeled proteins were pooled in a one-to-one molar ratio, and the free cysteines were alkylated employing 2.5 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min at 50 °C followed by a 30-min incubation at 37 °C with 15 mm iodoacetamide in a buffer containing 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate and 2 mm CaCl2. Finally, the sample was cleaved by the addition of 0.1 μg chymotrypsin for an overnight incubation at 37 °C. Obtained peptides were concentrated and washed employing a C18 Ziptip (Millipore Corporation) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. FVIII peptides were separated by reverse-phase chromatography and sprayed in a LTQ OrbitrapXL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) essentially as described (35.van Haren S.D. Herczenik E. ten Brinke A. Mertens K. Voorberg J. Meijer A.B. HLA-DR-presented peptide repertoires derived from human monocyte-derived dendritic cells pulsed with blood coagulation factor VIII.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10 (M110.002246)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). During reverse-phase chromatography, we employed a 40-min gradient from 0 to 35% (v/v) acetonitrile with 0.05% (v/v) acetic acid. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra and higher energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD) spectra were acquired as described by Dayon et al. (36.Dayon L. Pasquarello C. Hoogland C. Sanchez J.C. Scherl A. Combining low- and high-energy tandem mass spectra for optimized peptide quantification with isobaric tags.J. Proteomics. 2010; 73: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The three most intense precursor ions in the full scan (300–2000 m/z, resolving power 30,000) with a charge state of 2+ or higher were selected for CID using an isolation width of 2 Da, a 35% normalized collision energy, and an activation time of 30 ms. The same precursor ions were subjected to HCD with a normalized collision energy of 60%, which allows for the identification of the reporter group from the TMT label. The identity of the peptides, including TMT labeled lysine residues, and the TMT-127/TMT-126 ratio thereof were assessed employing Proteome discoverer 1.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The SEQUEST search algorithm and protein data base 25.H_sapiens.fasta were used to identify the peptides. The presence of the TMT label on peptides generates additional ion fragments in the tandem MS spectra that negatively influence the SEQUEST Xcorr score (37.Thingholm T.E. Palmisano G. Kjeldsen F. Larsen M.R. Undesirable charge-enhancement of isobaric tagged phosphopeptides leads to reduced identification efficiency.J. Proteome Res. 2010; 9: 4045-4052Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We therefore employed the following peptide selection criteria: (i) the peptide is identified in three of four independent experiments; (ii) the peptide is identified from both the CID and the HCD spectrum; (iii) lysine residues within the peptide are all modified by a TMT label (+225.1558 Da) and the cysteines are alkylated; (iv) peptides that included (or are close to) a thrombin cleavage site were excluded from the analysis. TMT ratios were normalized to the average ratio obtained for all peptides within one experiment. Factor Xase activity measurement and the preparation of phospholipid vesicles were performed as described before (30.Meems H. Meijer A.B. Cullinan D.B. Mertens K. Gilbert G.E. Factor VIII C1 domain residues Lys2092 and Phe2093 contribute to membrane binding and cofactor activity.Blood. 2009; 114: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μm sonicated phospholipid vesicles comprising 15% phosphatidylserine, 20% phosphatidylethanolamine, and 65% phosphatidylcholine were mixed with 0.3 nm FVIII, 200 nm FX, and 0–16 nm FIXa in a buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Merck). The reaction was started with the addition of 1.5 mm CaCl2 and 1 nm thrombin. The amount of FXa generated per minute was subsequently assessed as described (30.Meems H. Meijer A.B. Cullinan D.B. Mertens K. Gilbert G.E. Factor VIII C1 domain residues Lys2092 and Phe2093 contribute to membrane binding and cofactor activity.Blood. 2009; 114: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For the FVIIIa stability analysis, the FVIII variants were first incubated at varying time intervals with 2 nm thrombin and 1.5 mm CaCl2 in the presence and absence of increasing concentrations of FIXa (0–16 nm) at 25 °C in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (w/v) BSA, and 25 μm phospholipid vesicles. The generated amount of FXa was assessed as described (30.Meems H. Meijer A.B. Cullinan D.B. Mertens K. Gilbert G.E. Factor VIII C1 domain residues Lys2092 and Phe2093 contribute to membrane binding and cofactor activity.Blood. 2009; 114: 3938-3946Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Residual FVIII activity was derived from the initial rate of FXa formation as a function of the FIXa concentration. This residual FVIIIa activity was assessed 2, 5, 7.5, 12.5, 20, and 40 min after thrombin activation of at least three independent experiments. The inactivation rate constant, kinact, was estimated by fitting the mean data to a one-phase exponential decay equation (24.Wakabayashi H. Varfaj F. Deangelis J. Fay P.J. Generation of enhanced stability factor VIII variants by replacement of charged residues at the A2 domain interface.Blood. 2008; 112: 2761-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) by nonlinear least square regression analysis using Prism 5 (GraphPad Software). Surface plasmon resonance analysis was performed on a BIAcoreTM3000 system (Uppsala, Sweden) essentially as described (10.Meems H. van den Biggelaar M. Rondaij M. van der Zwaan C. Mertens K. Meijer A.B. C1 domain residues Lys2092 and Phe2093 are of major importance for the endocytic uptake of coagulation factor VIII.Int. J. Biochem.

Intracellular cotrafficking of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor type 2N variants to storage organelles.Blood. 2009; 113: 3102-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). EL14 was first coupled to a CM5 chip (GE Healthcare) to a density of 5000 response units (RU) employing the amide coupling kit as prescribed by the manufacturer. FVIII WT, K1967A, and K1968A were bound to immobilized EL14 by passing the proteins over EL14 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.005% Tween 20. After thrombin activation on the chip, the remaining FVIII light chain and/or A2 domain was assessed by passing either 100 nm KM33 or 100 nm CLB-CAg 9 over the immobilized proteins at a flow rate of 20 μl/min in the same buffer as described above. To identify FVIII lysine residues that are less prone to chemical modification in FVIII than in dis-FVIIIa, we labeled the lysine residues in plasma-derived FVIII with TMT-126 and those in dis-FVIIIa with TMT-127. Labeled FVIII and dis-FVIIIa were subsequently pooled and cleaved into peptides by chymotrypsin. A unique property of the TMT labels is that the same peptide ions carrying a TMT-126 or a TMT-127 exhibit an identical mass. However, fragmentation of these ions employing HCD generates a reporter ion from the TMT label as well as a mass spectrum of the peptide. The intensity of the signals of the reporter ions within each mass spectrum allows for calculating the TMT-127/TMT-126 ratio of the lysine-containing peptides (36.Dayon L. Pasquarello C. Hoogland C. Sanchez J.C. Scherl A. Combining low- and high-energy tandem mass spectra for optimized peptide quantification with isobaric tags.J. Proteomics. 2010; 73: 769-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 38.Thompson A. Schäfer J. Kuhn K. Kienle S. Schwarz J. Schmidt G. Neumann T. Johnstone R. Mohammed A.K. Hamon C. Tandem mass tags: a novel quantification strategy for comparative analysis of complex protein mixtures by MS/MS.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 1895-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar). As such, it can be assessed whether a lysine residue is more readily labeled in dis-FVIIIa or in FVIII (supplemental Fig. S1). To facilitate peptide identification, we also performed CID of the peptide ions. The above-mentioned approach was employed on plasma-derived FVIII. Fig. 1A shows the identified peptides that comprise TMT-modified lysine residues. Peptide identification scores are shown in supplemental Table S1. The average TMT-127/TMT-126 ratio obtained from peptides comprising the same TMT-modified lysine residues are displayed in Fig. 1B. The result reveals that most of the identified peptides exhibit an increased TMT-127/TMT-126 ratio. However, region Thr1964-Tyr1971 comprising the residues Lys1967 and Lys1968 was most prone to chemical modification in dis-FVIIIa (supplemental Fig. S2). This finding implies that Lys1967 and Lys1968 are buried within the protein core in FVIII and not in dis-FVIIIa. The mass spectrometry results suggest that the lysine residues 1967 and 1968 may contribute to the stability of FVIIIa. Intriguingly, replacement of Lys1967 with an isoleucine has been associated with mild hemophilia A, implying that this lysine may also directly contribute to cofactor activity (22.Kemball-Cook G. Tuddenham E.G. Wacey A.I. The factor VIII Structure and Mutation Resource Site: HAMSTeRS version 4.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 216-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Replacement of Lys1967 by an alanine in FVIII, however, did not result in a marked change in the specific one-stage clotting activity and the specific two-stage chromogenic activity. In addition, the relative specific activities of a K1967I FVIII variant were still 70% of FVIII WT. Surprisingly, a K1968A variant revealed a moderate (if any) increase in the specific chromogenic activity and a 2-fold increase in specific clotting activity (supplemental Table S2). To assess FVIII activity under more defined experimental conditions, we next evaluated the FVIII variants for their ability to enhance the activity of the FXa-generating complex employing purified proteins. To this end, FXa generation was assessed at increasing concentrations of FIXa in the presence of the activated FVIII variants (Fig. 2). The results showed that there was only a small difference in the efficiency of FXa generation for K1967I and K1967A compared with that of FVIII WT. However, K1968A displayed a markedly more effective FXa generation relative to FVIII WT. This was reflected by an almost 2-fold decrease in the apparent affinity constant (KD) for FIXa binding (KD = 2 nm for FVIII WT and 1.2 nm for K1968A) and an increased maximum rate of FXa generation. The finding that the hemophilic K1967I variant displays almost normal cofactor function suggests that Lys1967 may indeed contribute to the stability of FVIIIa. Because the A2 domain dissociation from FVIIIa inactivates the cofactor, we addressed whether or not mutation of the residues 1967 and 1968 affects the activity of FVIIIa over time. To this end, we activated FVIII WT and variants thereof with thrombin, and we measured the time-dependent decrease in cofactor activity at increasing FIXa concentrations. As expected, the results showed that there was a decline in cofactor activity over time for FVIII WT (Fig. 3). However, the rate of inactivation was about 3-fold increased for K1967I and 2-fold for K1967A. Strikingly, K1968A showed an about 3-fold decrease in the rate of inactivation relative to that of FVIIIa WT (Fig. 3E). This finding suggests that there is a decreased"
https://openalex.org/W2046471931,"Infusion of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNC) has been reported to ameliorate cardiac dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction. In this study, we investigated whether infusion of BMMNC is also effective for non-ischemic heart failure model mice and the underlying mechanisms. Intravenous infusion of BMMNC showed transient cardioprotective effects on animal models with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) without their engraftment in heart, suggesting that BMMNC infusion improves cardiac function via humoral factors rather than their differentiation into cardiomyocytes. Using conditioned media from sorted BMMNC, we found that the cardioprotective effects were mediated by growth hormone (GH) secreted from myeloid (Gr-1(+)) cells and the effects was partially mediated by signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 in cardiomyocytes. On the other hand, the GH expression in Gr-1(+) cells was significantly downregulated in DCM mice compared with that in healthy control, suggesting that the environmental cue in heart failure might suppress the Gr-1(+) cells function. Activin A was upregulated in the serum of DCM models and induced downregulation of GH levels in Gr-1(+) cells and serum. Furthermore, humoral factors upregulated in heart failure including angiotensin II upregulated activin A in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) via activation of NFκB. Similarly, serum activin A levels were also significantly higher in DCM patients with heart failure than in healthy subjects and the GH levels in conditioned medium from PBMNC of DCM patients were lower than that in healthy subjects. Inhibition of activin A increased serum GH levels and improved cardiac function of DCM model mice. These results suggest that activin A causes heart failure by suppressing GH activity and that inhibition of activin A might become a novel strategy for the treatment of heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2079558340,"High fat diet-induced hyperglycemia and palmitate-stimulated apoptosis was prevented by specific inhibition of protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) in β-cells. To understand the role of PKCδ in more detail the impact of changes in PKCδ activity on proliferation and survival of insulin-secreting cells was analyzed under stress-free conditions.Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, the effect of reduced and increased PKCδ activity on proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation of insulin secreting cells was examined. Proteins were analyzed by Western blotting and by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Increased expression of wild type PKCδ (PKCδWT) significantly stimulated proliferation of INS-1E cells with concomitant reduced expression and cytosolic retraction of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(Cip1/WAF1). This nuclear extrusion was mediated by PKCδ-dependent phosphorylation of p21(Cip1/WAF1) at Ser146. In kinase dead PKCδ (PKCδKN) overexpressing cells and after inhibition of endogenous PKCδ activity by rottlerin or RNA interference phosphorylation of p21(Cip1/WAF1) was reduced, which favored its nuclear accumulation and apoptotic cell death of INS-1E cells. Human and mouse islet cells express p21(Cip1/WAF1) with strong nuclear accumulation, while in islet cells of PKCδWT transgenic mice the inhibitor resides cytosolic.These observations disclose PKCδ as negative regulator of p21(Cip1/WAF1), which facilitates proliferation of insulin secreting cells under stress-free conditions and suggest that additional stress-induced changes push PKCδ into its known pro-apoptotic role."
https://openalex.org/W2037360829,"We have solved the x-ray structure of the N-terminal half of the yeast kinetochore protein Ndc10 at 1.9 Å resolution. This essential protein is a key constituent of the budding yeast centromere and is essential for the recruitment of the centromeric nucleosome and establishment of the kinetochore. The fold of the protein shows unexpected similarities to the tyrosine recombinase/λ-integrase family of proteins, most notably Cre, with some variation in the relative position of the subdomains. This finding offers new insights into kinetochore evolution and the adaptation of a well studied protein fold to a novel role. By comparison with tyrosine recombinases and mutagenesis studies, we have been able to define some of the key DNA-binding motifs."
https://openalex.org/W2056460504,"The goal of preserving nature is often in conflict with economic development and the aspirations of the rural poor. Nowhere is this more striking than in native grasslands, which have been extensively converted until a mere fraction of their original extent remains. This is not surprising; grasslands flourish in places coveted by humans, primed for agriculture, plantations, and settlements that nearly always trump conservation efforts. The Umgano grassland conservation and poverty reduction project in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa uses community-based spatial planning to balance the conversion of its lower-conservation value grasslands to a timber plantation, while conserving higher-value grasslands for heritage purposes and managed livestock grazing. Ten years after project launch, we measured the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of the project using Normalized Differential Vegetation Index remote sensing data and over 500 household interviews, as compared with similar non-conserved areas. Zoned management of the Umgano area had resulted in between 9% and 17% greater average peak production in the grassland areas compared to control sites. There was also a 21% gain in incomes for the roughly one hundred people employed by the forestry efforts, when compared to others in their village. Community-based spatial zoning is an overlooked tool for balancing conservation and development but may require, as we found in Umgano, certain critical factors including strong local leadership, an accountable financial management mechanism to distribute income, outside technical expertise for the zoning design, and community support."
https://openalex.org/W1989163238,"Estimation of Influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) varies with study design, clinical outcome considered and statistical methodology used. By estimating VE using differing outcomes and statistical methods on the same cohort of individuals the variability in the estimates produced can be better understood. The Pandemic Influenza Primary Care Reporting (PIPeR) cohort of approximately 193,000 individuals was used to estimate pandemic VE in Scotland during season 2009-10. VE results for three outcomes; influenza related consultations, virological confirmed influenza and death were considered. Use of individualised records allowed all models to be adjusted for age, sex, deprivation, risk status relating to chronic illnesses, seasonal vaccination status and a marker of the individual's propensity to consult. For the consultation and death outcomes, VE was calculated by comparing consultation rates in the unvaccinated and vaccinated groups, adjusted for the listed factors, using both Cox and Poisson regression models. For the consultation outcome, the unvaccinated group was split into individuals before vaccination and those never vaccinated to allow for potential differences in the health seeking behaviour of these groups. For the virology outcome estimates were calculated using a generalised additive logistic regression model. All models were adjusted for time. Vaccine effect was demonstrated for the influenza-like illness consultation outcome using the Cox model (VE=49% 95% CI (19%, 67%)) with lower estimates from the model splitting the before and never vaccinated groups (VE=34.2% with 95% CI (-0.5%, 58.9%)). Vaccine effect was also illustrated for overall mortality (VE=40% (95% CI 18%, 56%)) and a virological confirmed subset of symptomatic individuals (VE=60% (95% CI -38%, 89%)).This study illustrates positive point estimates of Influenza VE across methodology and outcome for a single cohort of individuals during season 2009-10. Understanding of potential differences between approaches aids interpretation of VE results in future seasons."
https://openalex.org/W1657934012,"RegnANN is a novel method for reverse engineering gene networks based on an ensemble of multilayer perceptrons. The algorithm builds a regressor for each gene in the network, estimating its neighborhood independently. The overall network is obtained by joining all the neighborhoods. RegnANN makes no assumptions about the nature of the relationships between the variables, potentially capturing high-order and non linear dependencies between expression patterns. The evaluation focuses on synthetic data mimicking plausible submodules of larger networks and on biological data consisting of submodules of Escherichia coli. We consider Barabasi and Erdös-Rényi topologies together with two methods for data generation. We verify the effect of factors such as network size and amount of data to the accuracy of the inference algorithm. The accuracy scores obtained with RegnANN is methodically compared with the performance of three reference algorithms: ARACNE, CLR and KELLER. Our evaluation indicates that RegnANN compares favorably with the inference methods tested. The robustness of RegnANN, its ability to discover second order correlations and the agreement between results obtained with this new methods on both synthetic and biological data are promising and they stimulate its application to a wider range of problems."
https://openalex.org/W2012319348,"Background Observing and monitoring the underwater social interactions of cetaceans is challenging. Therefore, previous cetacean studies have monitored these interactions by surface observations. However, because cetaceans spend most of their time underwater, it is important that their underwater behavior is also continuously monitored to better understand their social relationships and social structure. The finless porpoise is small and has no dorsal fin. It is difficult to observe this species in the wild, and little is known of its sociality. Methodology/Principal Findings The swim depths of 6 free-ranging finless porpoises were simultaneously recorded using a time-synchronized bio-logging system. Synchronous diving was used as an index of association. Two pairs, #27 (an immature female estimated to be 3.5 years old) and #32 (an adult male), #28 (a juvenile male estimated to be 2 years old) and #29 (an adult male), tended to participate in long periods of synchronized diving more frequently than 13 other possible pairs, indicating that the 4 porpoises chose their social partners. The adult males (#32, #29) tended to follow the immature female (#27) and juvenile male (#28), respectively. However, during synchronized diving, the role of an initiator often changed within the pair, and their body movements appeared to be non-agonistic, e.g., rubbing of bodies against one another instead of that on one-side, as observed with chasing and escaping behaviors. Conclusions/Significance The present study employed a time-synchronized bio-logging method to observe the social relationships of free-ranging aquatic animals based on swimming depth. The results suggest that certain individuals form associations even if they are not a mother and calf pair. Long synchronized dives occurred when particular members were reunited, and this suggests that the synchronized dives were not a by-product of opportunistic aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2026440052,"In living cells, mechanochemical coupling represents a dynamic means by which membrane components are spatially organized. An extra-ordinary example of such coupling involves curvature-dependent polar localization of chemically-distinct lipid domains at bacterial poles, which also undergo dramatic reequilibration upon subtle changes in their interfacial environment such as during sporulation. Here, we demonstrate that such interfacially-triggered mechanochemical coupling can be recapitulated in vitro by simultaneous, real-time introduction of mechanically-generated periodic curvatures and attendant strain-induced lateral forces in lipid bilayers supported on elastomeric substrates. In particular, we show that real-time wrinkling of the elastomeric substrate prompts a dynamic domain reorganization within the adhering bilayer, producing large, oriented liquid-ordered domains in regions of low curvature. Our results suggest a mechanism in which interfacial forces generated during surface wrinkling and the topographical deformation of the bilayer combine to facilitate dynamic reequilibration prompting the observed domain reorganization. We anticipate this curvature-generating model system will prove to be a simple and versatile tool for a broad range of studies of curvature-dependent dynamic reorganizations in membranes that are constrained by the interfacial elastic and dynamic frameworks such as the cell wall, glycocalyx, and cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2051304820,"Photosynthetic biomass production rapidly declines in mesophilic cyanobacteria grown above their physiological temperatures largely due to the imbalance between degradation and repair of the D1 protein subunit of the heat susceptible Photosystem II reaction centers (PSIIRC). Here we show that simultaneous replacement of two conserved residues in the D1 protein of the mesophilic Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, by the analogue residues present in the thermophilic Thermosynechococcus elongatus, enables photosynthetic growth, extensive biomass production and markedly enhanced stability and repair rate of PSIIRC for seven days even at 43°C but only at elevated CO2 (1%). Under the same conditions, the Synechocystis control strain initially presented very slow growth followed by a decline after 3 days. Change in the thylakoid membrane lipids, namely the saturation of the fatty acids is observed upon incubation for the different strains, but only the double mutant shows a concomitant major change of the enthalpy and entropy for the light activated QA−→QB electron transfer, rendering them similar to those of the thermophilic strain. Following these findings, computational chemistry and protein dynamics simulations we propose that the D1 double mutation increases the folding stability of the PSIIRC at elevated temperatures. This, together with the decreased impairment of D1 protein repair under increased CO2 concentrations result in the observed photothermal tolerance of the photosynthetic machinery in the double mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2058768009,"Recently, the construction of networks from time series data has gained widespread interest. In this paper, we develop this area further by introducing a network construction procedure for pseudoperiodic time series. We call such networks episode networks, in which an episode corresponds to a temporal interval of a time series, and which defines a node in the network. Our model includes a number of features which distinguish it from current methods. First, the proposed construction procedure is a parametric model which allows it to adapt to the characteristics of the data; the length of an episode being the parameter. As a direct consequence, networks of minimal size containing the maximal information about the time series can be obtained. In this paper, we provide an algorithm to determine the optimal value of this parameter. Second, we employ estimates of mutual information values to define the connectivity structure among the nodes in the network to exploit efficiently the nonlinearities in the time series. Finally, we apply our method to data from electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments and demonstrate that the constructed episode networks capture discriminative information from the underlying time series that may be useful for diagnostic purposes."
https://openalex.org/W2155656971,"To examine roles of the Cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) in mammalian circadian photoreception, we recorded single-unit neuronal firing activity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a primary circadian oscillator, and optic nerve fibers in vivo after retinal illumination in anesthetized Cry1 and Cry2 double-knockout (Cry-deficient) mice. In wild-type mice, most SCN neurons increased their firing frequency in response to retinal illumination at night, whereas only 17% of SCN neurons responded during the daytime. However, 40% of SCN neurons responded to light during the daytime, and 31% of SCN neurons responded at night in Cry-deficient mice. The magnitude of the photic response in SCN neurons at night was significantly lower (1.3-fold of spontaneous firing) in Cry-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (4.0-fold of spontaneous firing). In the optic nerve near the SCN, no difference in the proportion of light-responsive fibers was observed between daytime and nighttime in both genotypes. However, the response magnitude in the light-activated fibers (ON fibers) was high during the nighttime and low during the daytime in wild-type mice, whereas this day–night difference was not observed in Cry-deficient mice. In addition, we observed day–night differences in the spontaneous firing rates in the SCN in both genotypes and in the fibers of wild-type, but not Cry-deficient mice. We conclude that the low photo response in the SCN of Cry-deficient mice is caused by a circadian gating defect in the retina, suggesting that Cryptochromes are required for appropriate temporal photoreception in mammals."
