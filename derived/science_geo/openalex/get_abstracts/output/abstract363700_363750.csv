https://openalex.org/W2171526610,"The hypothesis that soluble amyloid-β peptide oligomer plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease is well established, yet no mechanistic basis for Aβ oligomer effects on neurons has been described. Several lines of evidence point to the existence of a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for soluble Aβ oligomers on neurons as central to Alzheimer's disease pathology and now cellular prion protein PrPC has been identified as a candidate for that role. PrP, a plasma membrane glycoprotein associated with lipid rafts, binds Aβ oligomers selectively with high affinity and mediates the deleterious effects of the peptide. These data raise the possibility that PrPC-specific drugs might have therapeutic potential in Alzheimer's, and point to an unexpected link between infectious prion diseases and Alzheimer's disease. This paper shows that the effects of amyloid-beta oligomers on long-term potentiation are mediated by the cellular prion protein — notorious for its involvement in diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, new variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease and kuru. A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is an accumulation of insoluble plaque containing the amyloid-β peptide of 40–42 amino acid residues1. Prefibrillar, soluble oligomers of amyloid-β have been recognized to be early and key intermediates in Alzheimer’s-disease-related synaptic dysfunction2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. At nanomolar concentrations, soluble amyloid-β oligomers block hippocampal long-term potentiation7, cause dendritic spine retraction from pyramidal cells5,8 and impair rodent spatial memory2. Soluble amyloid-β oligomers have been prepared from chemical syntheses, transfected cell culture supernatants, transgenic mouse brain and human Alzheimer’s disease brain2,4,7,9. Together, these data imply a high-affinity cell-surface receptor for soluble amyloid-β oligomers on neurons—one that is central to the pathophysiological process in Alzheimer’s disease. Here we identify the cellular prion protein (PrPC) as an amyloid-β-oligomer receptor by expression cloning. Amyloid-β oligomers bind with nanomolar affinity to PrPC, but the interaction does not require the infectious PrPSc conformation. Synaptic responsiveness in hippocampal slices from young adult PrP null mice is normal, but the amyloid-β oligomer blockade of long-term potentiation is absent. Anti-PrP antibodies prevent amyloid-β-oligomer binding to PrPC and rescue synaptic plasticity in hippocampal slices from oligomeric amyloid-β. Thus, PrPC is a mediator of amyloid-β-oligomer-induced synaptic dysfunction, and PrPC-specific pharmaceuticals may have therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease."

https://openalex.org/W2015918764,"Illegal and unreported fishing contributes to overexploitation of fish stocks and is a hindrance to the recovery of fish populations and ecosystems. This study is the first to undertake a world-wide analysis of illegal and unreported fishing. Reviewing the situation in 54 countries and on the high seas, we estimate that lower and upper estimates of the total value of current illegal and unreported fishing losses worldwide are between $10 bn and $23.5 bn annually, representing between 11 and 26 million tonnes. Our data are of sufficient resolution to detect regional differences in the level and trend of illegal fishing over the last 20 years, and we can report a significant correlation between governance and the level of illegal fishing. Developing countries are most at risk from illegal fishing, with total estimated catches in West Africa being 40% higher than reported catches. Such levels of exploitation severely hamper the sustainable management of marine ecosystems. Although there have been some successes in reducing the level of illegal fishing in some areas, these developments are relatively recent and follow growing international focus on the problem. This paper provides the baseline against which successful action to curb illegal fishing can be judged."
https://openalex.org/W2049387285,"Angiogenesis is controlled by physical interactions between cells and extracellular matrix as well as soluble angiogenic factors, such as VEGF. However, the mechanism by which mechanical signals integrate with other microenvironmental cues to regulate neovascularization remains unknown. Here we show that the Rho inhibitor, p190RhoGAP (also known as GRLF1), controls capillary network formation in vitro in human microvascular endothelial cells and retinal angiogenesis in vivo by modulating the balance of activities between two antagonistic transcription factors, TFII-I (also known as GTF2I) and GATA2, that govern gene expression of the VEGF receptor VEGFR2 (also known as KDR). Moreover, this new angiogenesis signalling pathway is sensitive to extracellular matrix elasticity as well as soluble VEGF. This is, to our knowledge, the first known functional cross-antagonism between transcription factors that controls tissue morphogenesis, and that responds to both mechanical and chemical cues."
https://openalex.org/W2069926681,"The rapid and extensive spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic provides a rare opportunity to witness host-pathogen co-evolution involving humans. A focal point is the interaction between genes encoding human leukocyte antigen (HLA) and those encoding HIV proteins. HLA molecules present fragments (epitopes) of HIV proteins on the surface of infected cells to enable immune recognition and killing by CD8(+) T cells; particular HLA molecules, such as HLA-B*57, HLA-B*27 and HLA-B*51, are more likely to mediate successful control of HIV infection. Mutation within these epitopes can allow viral escape from CD8(+) T-cell recognition. Here we analysed viral sequences and HLA alleles from >2,800 subjects, drawn from 9 distinct study cohorts spanning 5 continents. Initial analysis of the HLA-B*51-restricted epitope, TAFTIPSI (reverse transcriptase residues 128-135), showed a strong correlation between the frequency of the escape mutation I135X and HLA-B*51 prevalence in the 9 study cohorts (P = 0.0001). Extending these analyses to incorporate other well-defined CD8(+) T-cell epitopes, including those restricted by HLA-B*57 and HLA-B*27, showed that the frequency of these epitope variants (n = 14) was consistently correlated with the prevalence of the restricting HLA allele in the different cohorts (together, P < 0.0001), demonstrating strong evidence of HIV adaptation to HLA at a population level. This process of viral adaptation may dismantle the well-established HLA associations with control of HIV infection that are linked to the availability of key epitopes, and highlights the challenge for a vaccine to keep pace with the changing immunological landscape presented by HIV."
https://openalex.org/W2063611046,"Sleep restriction, leading to deprivation of sleep, is common in modern 24-h societies and is associated with the development of health problems including cardiovascular diseases. Our objective was to investigate the immunological effects of prolonged sleep restriction and subsequent recovery sleep, by simulating a working week and following recovery weekend in a laboratory environment.After 2 baseline nights of 8 hours time in bed (TIB), 13 healthy young men had only 4 hours TIB per night for 5 nights, followed by 2 recovery nights with 8 hours TIB. 6 control subjects had 8 hours TIB per night throughout the experiment. Heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured after the baseline (BL), sleep restriction (SR) and recovery (REC) period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at these time points, counted and stimulated with PHA. Cell proliferation was analyzed by thymidine incorporation and cytokine production by ELISA and RT-PCR. CRP was increased after SR (145% of BL; p<0.05), and continued to increase after REC (231% of BL; p<0.05). Heart rate was increased after REC (108% of BL; p<0.05). The amount of circulating NK-cells decreased (65% of BL; p<0.005) and the amount of B-cells increased (121% of BL; p<0.005) after SR, but these cell numbers recovered almost completely during REC. Proliferation of stimulated PBMC increased after SR (233% of BL; p<0.05), accompanied by increased production of IL-1beta (137% of BL; p<0.05), IL-6 (163% of BL; p<0.05) and IL-17 (138% of BL; p<0.05) at mRNA level. After REC, IL-17 was still increased at the protein level (119% of BL; p<0.05).5 nights of sleep restriction increased lymphocyte activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1beta IL-6 and IL-17; they remained elevated after 2 nights of recovery sleep, accompanied by increased heart rate and serum CRP, 2 important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, long-term sleep restriction may lead to persistent changes in the immune system and the increased production of IL-17 together with CRP may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2040275421,"Cilia are cell surface organelles found on most epithelia in vertebrates. Specialized groups of cilia have critical roles in embryonic development, including left-right axis formation. Recently, cilia have been implicated as recipients of cell-cell signalling. However, little is known about cell-cell signalling pathways that control the length of cilia. Here we provide several lines of evidence showing that fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling regulates cilia length and function in diverse epithelia during zebrafish and Xenopus development. Morpholino knockdown of FGF receptor 1 (Fgfr1) in zebrafish cell-autonomously reduces cilia length in Kupffer's vesicle and perturbs directional fluid flow required for left-right patterning of the embryo. Expression of a dominant-negative FGF receptor (DN-Fgfr1), treatment with SU5402 (a pharmacological inhibitor of FGF signalling) or genetic and morpholino reduction of redundant FGF ligands Fgf8 and Fgf24 reproduces this cilia length phenotype. Knockdown of Fgfr1 also results in shorter tethering cilia in the otic vesicle and shorter motile cilia in the pronephric ducts. In Xenopus, expression of a dn-fgfr1 results in shorter monocilia in the gastrocoel roof plate that control left-right patterning and in shorter multicilia in external mucociliary epithelium. Together, these results indicate a fundamental and highly conserved role for FGF signalling in the regulation of cilia length in multiple tissues. Abrogation of Fgfr1 signalling downregulates expression of two ciliogenic transcription factors, foxj1 and rfx2, and of the intraflagellar transport gene ift88 (also known as polaris), indicating that FGF signalling mediates cilia length through an Fgf8/Fgf24-Fgfr1-intraflagellar transport pathway. We propose that a subset of developmental defects and diseases ascribed to FGF signalling are due in part to loss of cilia function."
https://openalex.org/W2027723241,"Background MS pathogenesis seems to involve both genetic susceptibility and environmental risk factors. Three sequential factors are implicated in the environmental risk. The first acts near birth, the second acts during childhood, and the third acts long thereafter. Two candidate factors (vitamin D deficiency and Epstein-Barr viral infection) seem well suited to the first two environmental events. Methodology/Principal Findings A mathematical Model for MS pathogenesis is developed, incorporating these environmental and genetic factors into a causal scheme that can explain some of the recent changes in MS-epidemiology (e.g., increasing disease prevalence, a changing sex-ratio, and regional variations in monozygotic twin concordance rates). Conclusions/Significance This Model suggests that genetic susceptibility is overwhelmingly the most important determinant of MS pathogenesis. Indeed, over 99% of individuals seem genetically incapable of developing MS, regardless of what environmental exposures they experience. Nevertheless, the contribution of specific genes to MS-susceptibility seems only modest. Thus, despite HLA DRB1*1501 being the most consistently identified genetic marker of MS-susceptibility (being present in over 50% of northern MS patient populations), only about 1% of individuals with this allele are even genetically susceptible to getting MS. Moreover, because genetic susceptibility seems so similar throughout North America and Europe, environmental differences principally determine the regional variations in disease characteristics. Additionally, despite 75% of MS-patients being women, men are 60% more likely to be genetically-susceptible than women. Also, men develop MS at lower levels of environmental exposure than women. Nevertheless, women are more responsive to the recent changes in environmental-exposure (whatever these have been). This explains both the changing sex-ratio and the increasing disease prevalence (which has increased by a minimum of 32% in Canada over the past 35 years). As noted, environmental risk seems to result from three sequential components of environmental exposure. The potential importance of this Model for MS pathogenesis is that, if correct, a therapeutic strategy, designed to interrupt one or more of these sequential factors, has the potential to markedly reduce or eliminate disease prevalence in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2094573922,"Individuals with partial HSA21 trisomies and mice with partial MMU16 trisomies containing an extra copy of the DYRK1A gene present various alterations in brain morphogenesis. They present also learning impairments modeling those encountered in Down syndrome. Previous MRI and histological analyses of a transgenic mice generated using a human YAC construct that contains five genes including DYRK1A reveal that DYRK1A is involved, during development, in the control of brain volume and cell density of specific brain regions. Gene dosage correction induces a rescue of the brain volume alterations. DYRK1A is also involved in the control of synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation. Increased gene dosage results in brain morphogenesis defects, low BDNF levels and mnemonic deficits in these mice. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) — a member of a natural polyphenols family, found in great amount in green tea leaves — is a specific and safe DYRK1A inhibitor. We maintained control and transgenic mice overexpressing DYRK1A on two different polyphenol-based diets, from gestation to adulthood. The major features of the transgenic phenotype were rescued in these mice."
https://openalex.org/W1975852961,"The main asteroid belt lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, but the region is not uniformly filled with asteroids. There are gaps, known as the Kirkwood gaps, in the asteroid distribution in distinct locations that are associated with orbital resonances with the giant planets; asteroids placed in these locations follow chaotic orbits and escape from the asteroid belt. Here we show that the observed distribution of main belt asteroids does not fill uniformly even those regions that are dynamically stable over the age of the solar system. We find a pattern of excess depletion of asteroids, particularly just outward of the Kirkwood Gaps associated with the 5:2, the 7:3, and the 2:1 jovian resonances. These features are not accounted for by planetary perturbations in the current structure of the solar system, but are consistent with dynamical ejection of asteroids by the sweeping of gravitational resonances during the migration of Jupiter and Saturn ~4 gigayears ago."
https://openalex.org/W1988071414,"RT amplification reaction has revealed that various single viruses or viral co-infections caused acute bronchiolitis in infants, and RV appeared to have a growing involvement in early respiratory diseases. Because remaining controversial, the objective was to determine prospectively the respective role of RSV, RV, hMPV and co-infections on the severity of acute bronchiolitis in very young infants.209 infants (median age: 2.4 months) were enrolled in a prospective study of infants <1 year old, hospitalized for a first episode of bronchiolitis during the winter epidemic season and with no high risk for severe disease. The severity was assessed by recording SaO(2)% at admission, a daily clinical score (scale 0-18), the duration of oxygen supplementation and the length of hospitalization. Viruses were identified in 94.7% by RT amplification reaction: RSV only (45.8%), RV only (7.2%), hMPV only (3.8%), dual RSV/RV (14.3%), and other virus only (2%) or coinfections (9%). RV compared respectively with RSV and dual RSV/RV infection caused a significant less severe disease with a lower clinical score (5[3.2-6] vs. 6[4-8], p = 0.01 and 5.5[5-7], p = 0.04), a shorter time in oxygen supplementation (0[0-1] days vs. 2[0-3] days, p = 0.02 and 2[0-3] days, p = 0.03) and a shorter hospital stay (3[3-4.7] days vs.6 [5-8] days, p = 0.001 and 5[4-6] days, p = 0.04). Conversely, RSV infants had also longer duration of hospitalization in comparison with RSV/RV (p = 0.01) and hMPV (p = 0.04). The multivariate analyses showed that the type of virus carried was independently associated with the duration of hospitalization.This study underlined the role of RV in early respiratory diseases, as frequently carried by young infants with a first acute bronchiolitis. RSV caused the more severe disease and conversely RV the lesser severity. No additional effect of dual RSV/RV infection was observed on the severity."

https://openalex.org/W1964504848,"Functional neuroimaging studies have suggested activation of midline frontoparietal brain regions to be at the core of self-related processes. However, although some studies reported involvement of the insula, little attention has been paid to this region as forming part of the ""self""-network.Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we aimed at replicating and extending previous studies by scanning subjects whilst reflecting upon their own personal qualities as compared to those of an acquaintance. A third condition with statements about general knowledge was used to control for attention, semantic processing and decision making processes. The results showed a significant effect of task in brain activity, consistent with previous findings, by which both person conditions recruited a common set of medial prefrontal and posterior regions, yet significant differences between self and other were found in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Notably, significant neural activation in the left anterior insula was observed as uniquely associated with self-reflection.The results provide further evidence for the specific recruitment of anterior MPFC and ACC regions for self-related processing, and highlight a role for the insula in self-reflection. As the insula is closely connected with ascending internal body signals, this may indicate that the accumulation of changes in affective states that might be implied in self-processing may contribute to our sense of self."

https://openalex.org/W2135778789,"Background DNA barcoding promises to revolutionize the way taxonomists work, facilitating species identification by using small, standardized portions of the genome as substitutes for morphology. The concept has gained considerable momentum in many animal groups, but the higher plant world has been largely recalcitrant to the effort. In plants, efforts are concentrated on various regions of the plastid genome, but no agreement exists as to what kinds of regions are ideal, though most researchers agree that more than one region is necessary. One reason for this discrepancy is differences in the tests that are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed regions. Most tests have been made in a floristic setting, where the genetic distance and therefore the level of variation of the regions between taxa is large, or in a limited set of congeneric species. Methodology and Principal Findings Here we present the first in-depth coverage of a large taxonomic group, all 86 known species (except two doubtful ones) of crocus. Even six average-sized barcode regions do not identify all crocus species. This is currently an unrealistic burden in a barcode context. Whereas most proposed regions work well in a floristic context, the majority will – as is the case in crocus – undoubtedly be less efficient in a taxonomic setting. However, a reasonable but less than perfect level of identification may be reached – even in a taxonomic context. Conclusions/Significance The time is ripe for selecting barcode regions in plants, and for prudent examination of their utility. Thus, there is no reason for the plant community to hold back the barcoding effort by continued search for the Holy Grail. We must acknowledge that an emerging system will be far from perfect, fraught with problems and work best in a floristic setting."

https://openalex.org/W2112505333,"Mutations in PTEN induced kinase 1 (PINK1), a mitochondrial Ser/Thr kinase, cause an autosomal recessive form of Parkinson's disease (PD), PARK6. Here, we report that PINK1 exists as a dimer in mitochondrial protein complexes that co-migrate with respiratory chain complexes in sucrose gradients. PARK6 related mutations do not affect this dimerization and its associated complexes. Using in vitro cell culture systems, we found that mutant PINK1 or PINK1 knock-down caused deficits in mitochondrial respiration and ATP synthesis. Furthermore, proteasome function is impaired with a loss of PINK1. Importantly, these deficits are accompanied by increased α-synclein aggregation. Our results indicate that it will be important to delineate the relationship between mitochondrial functional deficits, proteasome dysfunction and α-synclein aggregation."

https://openalex.org/W2072045224,"Chlamydial infection of the host cell induces Gamma interferon (IFNγ), a central immunoprotector for humans and mice. The primary defense against Chlamydia infection in the mouse involves the IFNγ-inducible family of IRG proteins; however, the precise mechanisms mediating the pathogen's elimination are unknown. In this study, we identify Irga6 as an important resistance factor against C. trachomatis, but not C. muridarum, infection in IFNγ-stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We show that Irga6, Irgd, Irgm2 and Irgm3 accumulate at bacterial inclusions in MEFs upon stimulation with IFNγ, whereas Irgb6 colocalized in the presence or absence of the cytokine. This accumulation triggers a rerouting of bacterial inclusions to autophagosomes that subsequently fuse to lysosomes for elimination. Autophagy-deficient Atg5−/− MEFs and lysosomal acidification impaired cells surrender to infection. Irgm2, Irgm3 and Irgd still localize to inclusions in IFNγ-induced Atg5−/− cells, but Irga6 localization is disrupted indicating its pivotal role in pathogen resistance. Irga6-deficient (Irga6−/−) MEFs, in which chlamydial growth is enhanced, do not respond to IFNγ even though Irgb6, Irgd, Irgm2 and Irgm3 still localize to inclusions. Taken together, we identify Irga6 as a necessary factor in conferring host resistance by remodelling a classically nonfusogenic intracellular pathogen to stimulate fusion with autophagosomes, thereby rerouting the intruder to the lysosomal compartment for destruction."
https://openalex.org/W2074399756,"The prevalence of overweight is increasing globally and has become a serious health problem. Low-grade chronic inflammation in overweight subjects is thought to play an important role in disease development. Novel tools to understand these processes are needed. Metabolic profiling is one such tool that can provide novel insights into the impact of treatments on metabolism.To study the metabolic changes induced by a mild anti-inflammatory drug intervention, plasma metabolic profiling was applied in overweight human volunteers with elevated levels of the inflammatory plasma marker C-reactive protein. Liquid and gas chromatography mass spectrometric methods were used to detect high and low abundant plasma metabolites both in fasted conditions and during an oral glucose tolerance test. This is based on the concept that the resilience of the system can be assessed after perturbing a homeostatic situation.Metabolic changes were subtle and were only detected using metabolic profiling in combination with an oral glucose tolerance test. The repeated measurements during the oral glucose tolerance test increased statistical power, but the metabolic perturbation also revealed metabolites that respond differentially to the oral glucose tolerance test. Specifically, multiple metabolic intermediates of the glutathione synthesis pathway showed time-dependent suppression in response to the glucose challenge test. The fact that this is an insulin sensitive pathway suggests that inflammatory modulation may alter insulin signaling in overweight men."
https://openalex.org/W2050853570,"Otto Warburg observed that cancer cells are often characterized by intense glycolysis in the presence of oxygen and a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial respiration. Research has mainly focused on a possible connection between increased glycolysis and tumor development whereas decreased respiration has largely been left unattended. Therefore, a causal relation between decreased respiration and tumorigenesis has not been demonstrated.For this purpose, colonies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is suitable for manipulation of mitochondrial respiration and shows mitochondria-mediated cell death, were used as a model. Repression of respiration as well as ROS-scavenging via glutathione inhibited apoptosis and conferred a survival advantage during seeding and early development of this fast proliferating solid cell population. In contrast, enhancement of respiration triggered cell death.Thus, the Warburg effect might directly contribute to the initiation of cancer formation--not only by enhanced glycolysis--but also via decreased respiration in the presence of oxygen, which suppresses apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1988964842,"Altered structure, and hence function, of cellular macromolecules caused by oxidation can contribute to loss of physiological function with age. Here, we tested whether the lifespan of bats, which generally live far longer than predicted by their size, could be explained by reduced protein damage relative to short-lived mice. We show significantly lower protein oxidation (carbonylation) in Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) relative to mice, and a trend for lower oxidation in samples from cave myotis bats (Myotis velifer) relative to mice. Both species of bat show in vivo and in vitro resistance to protein oxidation under conditions of acute oxidative stress. These bat species also show low levels of protein ubiquitination in total protein lysates along with reduced proteasome activity, suggesting diminished protein damage and removal in bats. Lastly, we show that bat-derived protein fractions are resistant to urea-induced protein unfolding relative to the level of unfolding detected in fractions from mice. Together, these data suggest that long lifespan in some bat species might be regulated by very efficient maintenance of protein homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1982491674,"How defense genes originated with the evolution of their specific pathogen-responsive traits remains an important problem. It is generally known that a form of duplication can generate new genes, suggesting that a new gene usually evolves from an ancestral gene. However, we show that a new defense gene in plants may evolve by de novo origination, resulting in sophisticated disease-resistant functions in rice. Analyses of gene evolution showed that this new gene, OsDR10, had homologs only in the closest relative, Leersia genus, but not other subfamilies of the grass family; therefore, it is a rice tribe-specific gene that may have originated de novo in the tribe. We further show that this gene may evolve a highly conservative rice-specific function that contributes to the regulation difference between rice and other plant species in response to pathogen infections. Biologic analyses including gene silencing, pathologic analysis, and mutant characterization by transformation showed that the OsDR10-suppressed plants enhanced resistance to a broad spectrum of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae strains, which cause bacterial blight disease. This enhanced disease resistance was accompanied by increased accumulation of endogenous salicylic acid (SA) and suppressed accumulation of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) as well as modified expression of a subset of defense-responsive genes functioning both upstream and downstream of SA and JA. These data and analyses provide fresh insights into the new biologic and evolutionary processes of a de novo gene recruited rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2023680182,"Background Enhanced lysosomal trafficking is associated with metastatic cancer. In an attempt to discover cancer relevant lysosomal motor proteins, we compared the lysosomal proteomes from parental MCF-7 breast cancer cells with those from highly invasive MCF-7 cells that express an active form of the ErbB2 (ΔN-ErbB2). Methodology/Principal Findings Mass spectrometry analysis identified kinesin heavy chain protein KIF5B as the only microtubule motor associated with the lysosomes in MCF-7 cells, and ectopic ΔN-ErbB2 enhanced its lysosomal association. KIF5B associated with lysosomes also in HeLa cervix carcinoma cells as analyzed by subcellular fractionation. The depletion of KIF5B triggered peripheral aggregations of lysosomes followed by lysosomal destabilization, and cell death in HeLa cells. Lysosomal exocytosis in response to plasma membrane damage as well as fluid phase endocytosis functioned, however, normally in these cells. Both HeLa and MCF-7 cells appeared to express similar levels of the KIF5B isoform but the death phenotype was weaker in KIF5B-depleted MCF-7 cells. Surprisingly, KIF5B depletion inhibited the rapamycin-induced accumulation of autophagosomes in MCF-7 cells. In KIF5B-depleted cells the autophagosomes formed and accumulated in the close proximity to the Golgi apparatus, whereas in the control cells they appeared uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm. Conclusions/Significance Our data identify KIF5B as a cancer relevant lysosomal motor protein with additional functions in autophagosome formation."
https://openalex.org/W1994600425,"Whilst the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is well characterized in the anuran Xenopus, this region has not previously been studied in another popular model species, the common frog (Rana temporaria). Nor, to date, have there been any studies of MHC in wild amphibian host-pathogen systems. We characterise an MHC class I locus in the common frog, and present primers to amplify both the whole region, and specifically the antigen binding region. As no more than two expressed haplotypes were found in over 400 clones from 66 individuals, it is likely that there is a single class I locus in this species. This finding is consistent with the single class I locus in Xenopus, but contrasts with the multiple loci identified in axolotls, providing evidence that the diversification of MHC class I into multiple loci likely occurred after the Caudata/Anura divergence (approximately 350 million years ago) but before the Ranidae/Pipidae divergence (approximately 230 mya). We use this locus to compare wild populations of common frogs that have been infected with a viral pathogen (Ranavirus) with those that have no history of infection. We demonstrate that certain MHC supertypes are associated with infection status (even after accounting for shared ancestry), and that the diseased populations have more similar supertype frequencies (lower FST) than the uninfected. These patterns were not seen in a suite of putatively neutral microsatellite loci. We interpret this pattern at the MHC locus to indicate that the disease has imposed selection for particular haplotypes, and hence that common frogs may be adapting to the presence of Ranavirus, which currently kills tens of thousands of amphibians in the UK each year."
https://openalex.org/W1984939227,"Background Autism is a complex childhood neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic basis. Microdeletion or duplication of a ∼500–700-kb genomic rearrangement on 16p11.2 that contains 24 genes represents the second most frequent chromosomal disorder associated with autism. The role of common and rare 16p11.2 sequence variants in autism etiology is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings To identify common 16p11.2 variants with a potential role in autism, we performed association studies using existing data generated from three microarray platforms: Affymetrix 5.0 (777 families), Illumina 550 K (943 families), and Affymetrix 500 K (60 families). No common variants were identified that were significantly associated with autism. To look for rare variants, we performed resequencing of coding and promoter regions for eight candidate genes selected based on their known expression patterns and functions. In total, we identified 26 novel variants in autism: 13 exonic (nine non-synonymous, three synonymous, and one untranslated region) and 13 promoter variants. We found a significant association between autism and a coding variant in the seizure-related gene SEZ6L2 (12/1106 autism vs. 3/1161 controls; p = 0.018). Sez6l2 expression in mouse embryos was restricted to the spinal cord and brain. SEZ6L2 expression in human fetal brain was highest in post-mitotic cortical layers, hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus. Association analysis of SEZ6L2 in an independent sample set failed to replicate our initial findings. Conclusions/Significance We have identified sequence variation in at least one candidate gene in 16p11.2 that may represent a novel genetic risk factor for autism. However, further studies are required to substantiate these preliminary findings."

https://openalex.org/W1981041844,"Thyroid hormone (TH) is critical to normal brain development, but the mechanisms operating in this process are poorly understood. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation to enrich regions of DNA bound to thyroid receptor beta (TRβ) of mouse cerebellum sampled on post natal day 15. Enriched target was hybridized to promoter microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) spanning −8 kb to +2 kb of the transcription start site (TSS) of 5000 genes. We identified 91 genes with TR binding sites. Roughly half of the sites were located in introns, while 30% were located within 1 kb upstream (5′) of the TSS. Of these genes, 83 with known function included genes involved in apoptosis, neurodevelopment, metabolism and signal transduction. Two genes, MBP and CD44, are known to contain TREs, providing validation of the system. This is the first report of TR binding for 81 of these genes. ChIP-on-chip results were confirmed for 10 of the 13 binding fragments using ChIP-PCR. The expression of 4 novel TH target genes was found to be correlated with TH levels in hyper/hypothyroid animals providing further support for TR binding. A TRβ binding site upstream of the coding region of myelin associated glycoprotein was demonstrated to be TH-responsive using a luciferase expression system. Motif searches did not identify any classic binding elements, indicating that not all TR binding sites conform to variations of the classic form. These findings provide mechanistic insight into impaired neurodevelopment resulting from TH deficiency and a rich bioinformatics resource for developing a better understanding of TR binding."

Observations of the clinical behaviour of prostate tumors suggest that the increased secretion of IL-6 and CCL5 and the higher expression of PSMA may be correlated. We hypothesized that PSMA could be endowed with signalling properties and that its stimulation might impact on the regulation of the gene expression of IL-6 and CCL5. We herein demonstrate that the cross-linking of cell surface PSMA with specific antibodies activates the small GTPases RAS and RAC1 and the MAPKs p38 and ERK1/2 in prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells. As downstream effects of the PSMA-fostered RAS-RAC1-MAPK pathway activation we observed a strong induction of NF-kappaB activation associated with an increased expression of IL-6 and CCL5 genes. Pharmacological blockade with specific inhibitors revealed that both p38 and ERK1/2 participate in the phenomenon, although a major role exerted by p38 was evident. Finally we demonstrate that IL-6 and CCL5 enhanced the proliferative potential of LNCaP cells synergistically and in a dose-dependent manner and that CCL5 functioned by receptor-mediated activation of the STAT5-Cyclin D1 pro-proliferative pathway. The novel functions attributable to PSMA which are described in the present report may have profound influence on the survival and proliferation of prostate tumor cells, accounting for the observation that PSMA overexpression in prostate cancer patients is related to a worse prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W2093379009,"Mechanical ventilation, a fundamental therapy for acute lung injury, worsens pulmonary vascular permeability by exacting mechanical stress on various components of the respiratory system causing ventilator associated lung injury. We postulated that MK2 activation via p38 MAP kinase induced HSP25 phosphorylation, in response to mechanical stress, leading to actin stress fiber formation and endothelial barrier dysfunction. We sought to determine the role of p38 MAP kinase and its downstream effector MK2 on HSP25 phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation in ventilator associated lung injury. Wild type and MK2(-/-) mice received mechanical ventilation with high (20 ml/kg) or low (7 ml/kg) tidal volumes up to 4 hrs, after which lungs were harvested for immunohistochemistry, immunoblotting and lung permeability assays. High tidal volume mechanical ventilation resulted in significant phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase, MK2, HSP25, actin polymerization, and an increase in pulmonary vascular permeability in wild type mice as compared to spontaneous breathing or low tidal volume mechanical ventilation. However, pretreatment of wild type mice with specific p38 MAP kinase or MK2 inhibitors abrogated HSP25 phosphorylation and actin polymerization, and protected against increased lung permeability. Finally, MK2(-/-) mice were unable to phosphorylate HSP25 or increase actin polymerization from baseline, and were resistant to increases in lung permeability in response to HV(T) MV. Our results suggest that p38 MAP kinase and its downstream effector MK2 mediate lung permeability in ventilator associated lung injury by regulating HSP25 phosphorylation and actin cytoskeletal remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W2085278043,"Background The mechanisms underlying neurotoxicity caused by L-DOPA are not yet completely known. Based on recent findings, we speculated that the increased expression of divalent metal transporter 1 without iron-response element (DMT1−IRE) induced by L-DOPA might play a critical role in the development of L-DOPA neurotoxicity. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) and siRNA DMT-IRE on L-DOPA neurotoxicity in cortical neurons. Methods and Findings We demonstrated that neurons treated with L-DOPA have a significant dose-dependent decrease in neuronal viability (MTT Assay) and increase in iron content (using a graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotometer), DMT1−IRE expression (Western blot analysis) and ferrous iron (55Fe(II)) uptake. Neurons incubated in ACM with or without L-DOPA had no significant differences in their morphology, Hoechst-33342 staining or viability. Also, ACM significantly inhibited the effects of L-DOPA on neuronal iron content as well as DMT1−IRE expression. In addition, we demonstrated that infection of neurons with siRNA DMT-IRE led to a significant decrease in DMT1−IRE expression as well as L-DOPA neurotoxicity. Conclusion The up-regulation of DMT1−IRE and the increase in DMT1−IRE-mediated iron influx play a key role in L-DOPA neurotoxicity in cortical neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1979699055,"The first step in the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) infections is adhesion of the bacterium to the small intestinal epithelium. Adhesion of ETEC is mediated by a number of antigenically distinct colonization factors, and among these, one of the most commonly detected is the non-fimbrial adhesin coli surface antigen 6 (CS6). The potential carbohydrate recognition by CS6 was investigated by binding of recombinant CS6-expressing E. coli and purified CS6 protein to a large number of variant glycosphingolipids separated on thin-layer chromatograms. Thereby, a highly specific binding of the CS6-expressing E. coli, and the purified CS6 protein, to sulfatide (SO(3)-3Galbeta1Cer) was obtained. The binding of the CS6 protein and CS6-expressing bacteria to sulfatide was inhibited by dextran sulfate, but not by dextran, heparin, galactose 4-sulfate or galactose 6-sulfate. When using recombinantly expressed and purified CssA and CssB subunits of the CS6 complex, sulfatide binding was obtained with the CssB subunit, demonstrating that the glycosphingolipid binding capacity of CS6 resides within this subunit. CS6-binding sulfatide was present in the small intestine of species susceptible to CS6-mediated infection, e.g. humans and rabbits, but lacking in species not affected by CS6 ETEC, e.g. mice. The ability of CS6-expressing ETEC to adhere to sulfatide in target small intestinal epithelium may thus contribute to virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1974532720,"It is well established that the efficacy of synaptic connections can be rapidly modified by neural activity, yet how the environment and prior experience modulate such synaptic and behavioral plasticity is only beginning to be understood. Here we show in C. elegans that the broadly conserved scaffolding molecule MAGI-1 is required for the plasticity observed in a glutamatergic circuit. This mechanosensory circuit mediates reversals in locomotion in response to touch stimulation, and the AMPA-type receptor (AMPAR) subunits GLR-1 and GLR-2, which are required for reversal behavior, are localized to ventral cord synapses in this circuit. We find that animals modulate GLR-1 and GLR-2 localization in response to prior mechanosensory stimulation; a specific isoform of MAGI-1 (MAGI-1L) is critical for this modulation. We show that MAGI-1L interacts with AMPARs through the intracellular domain of the GLR-2 subunit, which is required for the modulation of AMPAR synaptic localization by mechanical stimulation. In addition, mutations that prevent the ubiquitination of GLR-1 prevent the decrease in AMPAR localization observed in previously stimulated magi-1 mutants. Finally, we find that previously-stimulated animals later habituate to subsequent mechanostimulation more rapidly compared to animals initially reared without mechanical stimulation; MAGI-1L, GLR-1, and GLR-2 are required for this change in habituation kinetics. Our findings demonstrate that prior experience can cause long-term alterations in both behavioral plasticity and AMPAR localization at synapses in an intact animal, and indicate a new, direct role for MAGI/S-SCAM proteins in modulating AMPAR localization and function in the wake of variable sensory experience."
https://openalex.org/W2006515039,"Background Photosynthetic light-harvesting proteins are the mechanism by which energy enters the marine ecosystem. The dominant prokaryotic photoautotrophs are the cyanobacterial genera Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus that are defined by two distinct light-harvesting systems, chlorophyll-bound protein complexes or phycobilin-bound protein complexes, respectively. Here, we use the Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) Project as a unique and powerful tool to analyze the environmental diversity of photosynthetic light-harvesting genes in relation to available metadata including geographical location and physical and chemical environmental parameters. Methods All light-harvesting gene fragments and their metadata were obtained from the GOS database, aligned using ClustalX and classified phylogenetically. Each sequence has a name indicative of its geographic location; subsequent biogeographical analysis was performed by correlating light-harvesting gene budgets for each GOS station with surface chlorophyll concentration. Conclusion/Significance Using the GOS data, we have mapped the biogeography of light-harvesting genes in marine cyanobacteria on ocean-basin scales and show that an environmental gradient exists in which chlorophyll concentration is correlated to diversity of light-harvesting systems. Three functionally distinct types of light-harvesting genes are defined: (1) the phycobilisome (PBS) genes of Synechococcus; (2) the pcb genes of Prochlorococcus; and (3) the iron-stress-induced (isiA) genes present in some marine Synechococcus. At low chlorophyll concentrations, where nutrients are limited, the Pcb-type light-harvesting system shows greater genetic diversity; whereas at high chlorophyll concentrations, where nutrients are abundant, the PBS-type light-harvesting system shows higher genetic diversity. We interpret this as an environmental selection of specific photosynthetic strategy. Importantly, the unique light-harvesting system isiA is found in the iron-limited, high-nutrient low-chlorophyll region of the equatorial Pacific. This observation demonstrates the ecological importance of isiA genes in enabling marine Synechococcus to acclimate to iron limitation and suggests that the presence of this gene can be a natural biomarker for iron limitation in oceanic environments."
https://openalex.org/W1994952209,"Progressive resistance exercise training (PRT) improves physical functioning in patients with HIV infection. Creatine supplementation can augment the benefits derived from training in athletes and improve muscle function in patients with muscle wasting. The objective of this study was to determine whether creatine supplementation augments the effects of PRT on muscle strength, energetics, and body composition in HIV-infected patients.This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, clinical research center-based, outpatient study in San Francisco. 40 HIV-positive men (20 creatine, 20 placebo) enrolled in a 14-week study. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive creatine monohydrate or placebo for 14 weeks. Treatment began with a loading dose of 20 g/day or an equivalent number of placebo capsules for 5 days, followed by maintenance dosing of 4.8 g/day or placebo. Beginning at week 2 and continuing to week 14, all subjects underwent thrice-weekly supervised resistance exercise while continuing on the assigned study medication (with repeated 6-week cycles of loading and maintenance). The main outcome measurements included muscle strength (one repetition maximum), energetics ((31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy), composition and size (magnetic resonance imaging), as well as total body composition (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). Thirty-three subjects completed the study (17 creatine, 16 placebo). Strength increased in all 8 muscle groups studied following PRT, but this increase was not augmented by creatine supplementation (average increase 44 vs. 42%, difference 2%, 95% CI -9.5% to 13.9%) in creatine and placebo, respectively). There were no differences between groups in changes in muscle energetics. Thigh muscle cross-sectional area increased following resistance exercise, with no additive effect of creatine. Lean body mass (LBM) increased to a significantly greater extent with creatine. CONCLUSIONS / SIGNIFICANCE: Resistance exercise improved muscle size, strength and function in HIV-infected men. While creatine supplementation produced a greater increase in LBM, it did not augment the robust increase in strength derived from PRT.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00484627."
https://openalex.org/W2055006666,"Diffusion of inner membrane proteins is a prerequisite for correct functionality of mitochondria. The complicated structure of tubular, vesicular or flat cristae and their small connections to the inner boundary membrane impose constraints on the mobility of proteins making their diffusion a very complicated process. Therefore we investigate the molecular transport along the main mitochondrial axis using highly accurate computational methods. Diffusion is modeled on a curvilinear surface reproducing the shape of mitochondrial inner membrane (IM). Monte Carlo simulations are carried out for topologies resembling both tubular and lamellar cristae, for a range of physiologically viable crista sizes and densities. Geometrical confinement induces up to several-fold reduction in apparent mobility. IM surface curvature per se generates transient anomalous diffusion (TAD), while finite and stable values of projected diffusion coefficients are recovered in a quasi-normal regime for short- and long-time limits. In both these cases, a simple area-scaling law is found sufficient to explain limiting diffusion coefficients for permeable cristae junctions, while asymmetric reduction of the junction permeability leads to strong but predictable variations in molecular motion rate. A geometry-based model is given as an illustration for the time-dependence of diffusivity when IM has tubular topology. Implications for experimental observations of diffusion along mitochondria using methods of optical microscopy are drawn out: a non-homogenous power law is proposed as a suitable approach to TAD. The data demonstrate that if not taken into account appropriately, geometrical effects lead to significant misinterpretation of molecular mobility measurements in cellular curvilinear membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2019034341,"Neutral endopeptidase, also known as neprilysin and abbreviated NEP, is considered to be one of the key enzymes in initial human amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation. The aim of our study was to explore the impact of NEP deficiency on the initial development of dementia-like symptoms in mice.We found that while endogenous Abeta concentrations were elevated in the brains of NEP-knockout mice at all investigated age groups, immunohistochemical analysis using monoclonal antibodies did not detect any Abeta deposits even in old NEP knockout mice. Surprisingly, tests of learning and memory revealed that the ability to learn was not reduced in old NEP-deficient mice but instead had significantly improved, and sustained learning and memory in the aged mice was congruent with improved long-term potentiation (LTP) in brain slices of the hippocampus and lateral amygdala. Our data suggests a beneficial effect of pharmacological inhibition of cerebral NEP on learning and memory in mice due to the accumulation of peptides other than Abeta degradable by NEP. By conducting degradation studies and peptide measurements in the brain of both genotypes, we identified two neuropeptide candidates, glucagon-like peptide 1 and galanin, as first potential candidates to be involved in the improved learning in aged NEP-deficient mice.Thus, the existence of peptides targeted by NEP that improve learning and memory in older individuals may represent a promising avenue for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2045021351,"Ravens (Corvus corax) feed primarily on rich but ephemeral carcasses of large animals, which are usually defended by territorial pairs of adults. Non-breeding juveniles forage socially and aggregate in communal winter roosts, and these appear to function as 'information centers' regarding the location of the rare food bonanzas: individuals search independently of one another and pool their effort by recruiting each other at roosts. However, at a large raven roost in Newborough on Anglesey, North Wales, some juveniles have been observed recently to forage in 'gangs' and to roost separately from other birds. Here we adapt a general model of juvenile common raven foraging behavior where, in addition to the typical co-operative foraging strategy, such gang foraging behavior could be evolutionarily stable near winter raven roosts. We refocus the model on the conditions under which this newly documented, yet theoretically anticipated, gang-based foraging has been observed. In the process, we show formally how the trade off between search efficiency and social opportunity can account for the existence of the alternative social foraging tactics that have been observed in this species. This work serves to highlight a number of fruitful avenues for future research, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective."
https://openalex.org/W1997586445,"Protein S (PS) is a cofactor for activated protein C (APC), which inactivates coagulation factors (F) Va and VIIIa. Deficiency of protein C or PS is associated with risk of thrombosis. We found that PS also has APC-independent anticoagulant activity (PS-direct) and directly inhibits thrombin generated by FXa/FVa (prothrombinase complex). Here we report that PS contains Zn(2+) that is required for PS-direct and that is lost during certain purification procedures. Immunoaffinity-purified PS contained 1.4 +/- 0.6 Zn(2+)/mol, whereas MonoQ-purified and commercial PS contained 0.15 +/- 0.15 Zn(2+)/mol. This may explain the controversy regarding the validity of PS-direct. Zn(2+) content correlated positively with PS-direct in prothrombinase assays and clotting assays, but APC-cofactor activity of PS was independent of Zn(2+) content. PS-direct and Zn(2+) were restored to inactive PS under mildly denaturing conditions. Conversely, o-phenanthroline reversibly impaired the PS-direct of active PS. Zn(2+)-containing PS bound FXa more efficiently (K(d)(app)=9.3 nM) than Zn(2+)-deficient PS (K(d)(app)=110 nM). PS bound TFPI efficiently, independently of Zn(2+) content (K(d)(app)=21 nM). Antibodies that block PS-direct preferentially recognized Zn(2+)-containing PS, suggesting conformation differences at or near the interface of 2 laminin G-like domains near the PS C terminus. Thus, Zn(2+) is required for PS-direct and efficient FXa binding and may play a role in stabilizing PS conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2055643502,"In response to a conditioning stress, the expression of a set of molecular chaperones called heat shock proteins is increased. In neurons, stress-induced and constitutively expressed molecular chaperones protect against damage induced by ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases, however the molecular basis of this protection is not known. Here we have investigated the crosstalk between stress-induced chaperones and cysteine string protein (CSPalpha). CSPalpha is a constitutively expressed synaptic vesicle protein bearing a J domain and a cysteine rich ""string"" region that has been implicated in the long term functional integrity of synaptic transmission and the defense against neurodegeneration. We have shown previously that the CSPalpha chaperone complex increases isoproterenol-mediated signaling by stimulating GDP/GTP exchange of Galpha(s). In this report we demonstrate that in response to heat shock or treatment with the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, the J protein Hsp40 becomes a major component of the CSPalpha complex. Association of Hsp40 with CSPalpha decreases CSPalpha-CSPalpha dimerization and enhances the CSPalpha-induced increase in steady state GTP hydrolysis of Galpha(s). This newly identified CSPalpha-Hsp40 association reveals a previously undescribed coupling of J proteins. In view of the crucial importance of stress-induced chaperones in the protection against cell death, our data attribute a role for Hsp40 crosstalk with CSPalpha in neuroprotection."
https://openalex.org/W1992197455,"Background Disseminated dormant cancer cells can resume growth and eventually form overt metastases, but the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for this change remains obscure. We previously established that cell surface interaction between urokinase receptor (uPAR) and α5β1-integrin initiates a sequel of events, involving MAPK-ERK activation that culminates in progressive cancer growth. We also identified the site on uPAR that binds α5β1-integrin. Disruption of uPAR/integrin interaction blocks ERK activation and forces cancer cells into dormancy. Methods and Principle Findings Using a target structure guided computation docking we identified 68 compounds from a diversity library of 13,000 small molecules that were predicted to interact with a previously identified integrin-binding site on uPAR. Of these 68 chemical hits, ten inhibited ERK activation in a cellular assay and of those, 2 compounds, 2-(Pyridin-2-ylamino)-quinolin-8-ol and, 2,2′-(methylimino)di (8-quinolinol) inhibited ERK activation by disrupting the uPAR/integrins interaction. These two compounds, when applied in vivo, inhibited ERK activity and tumor growth and blocked metastases of a model head and neck carcinoma. Conclusions/Significance We showed that interaction between two large proteins (uPAR and α5β1-integrin) can be disrupted by a small molecule leading to profound downstream effects. Because this interaction occurs in cells with high uPAR expression, a property almost exclusive to cancer cells, we expect a new therapy based on these lead compounds to be cancer cell specific and minimally toxic. This treatment, rather than killing disseminated metastatic cells, should induce a protracted state of dormancy and prevent overt metastases."

YscM1 and YscM2 proteins have been reported to be functionally equivalent regulators of the T3SS in Yersinia enterocolitica. Here, we show by affinity purification, native gel electrophoresis and small angle x-ray scattering that both YscM1 and YscM2 bind to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) of Y. enterocolitica. Under in vitro conditions, YscM1, but not YscM2, was found to inhibit PEPC with an apparent IC50 of 4 μm (Ki = 1 μm). To analyze the functional roles of PEPC, YscM1, and YscM2 in Yop-producing bacteria, cultures of Y. enterocolitica wild type and mutants defective in the formation of PEPC, YscM1, or YscM2, respectively, were grown under low calcium conditions in the presence of [U-13C6]glucose. The isotope compositions of secreted Yop proteins and nine amino acids from cellular proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The data indicate that a considerable fraction of oxaloacetate used as precursor for amino acids was derived from [13C3]phosphoenolpyruvate by the catalytic action of PEPC in the wild-type strain but not in the PEPC- mutant. The data imply that PEPC is critically involved in replenishing the oxaloacetate pool in the citrate cycle under virulence conditions. In the YscM1- and YscM2- mutants, increased rates of pyruvate formation via glycolysis or the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, of oxaloacetate formation via the citrate cycle, and of amino acid biosynthesis suggest that both regulators trigger the central metabolism of Y. enterocolitica. We propose a “load-and-shoot cycle” model to account for the cross-talk between T3SS and metabolism in pathogenic yersiniae.

Cornelis G.R. Physiol. (Bethesda). 2005; 20: 326-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The translocated effector proteins reprogram the host cell in favor of the microbial invader or symbiont. Pathogenic yersiniae (the enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the plague bacillus Yersinia pestis) utilize a plasmid-encoded T3SS to undermine the host primary immune response (2Heesemann J. Sing A. Trülzsch K. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2006; 9: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This is mediated by the injection of a set of effector proteins called Yops (Yersinia outer proteins) into host cells, in particular into cells with innate immune functions, such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and neutrophils (3Marketon M.M. DePaolo R.W. DeBord K.L. Jabri B. Schneewind O. Science. 2005; 309: 1739-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The concerted action of Yops, targeting multiple signaling pathways, results in actin cytoskeleton disruption, suppression of proinflammatory signaling, and induction of apoptosis. This strategy enables yersiniae to multiply extracellularly in host tissue. Expression of the Yersinia T3SS is up-regulated at 37 °C, and translocation of Yops across the host cell membrane is triggered by cell contact (4Rosqvist R. Magnusson K.E. Wolf-Watz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, 5Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pathogenic yersiniae cultivated under low calcium conditions at 37 °C express a phenotype referred to as “low calcium response” (LCR). The LCR is characterized by growth restriction as well as massive expression and secretion of Yops into the culture medium (6Higuchi K. Kupferberg L.L. Smith J.L. J. Bacteriol. 1959; 77: 317-321Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Carter P.B. Zahorchak R.J. Brubaker R.R. Infect. Immun. 1980; 28: 638-640PubMed Google Scholar, 8Goguen J.D. Yother J. Straley S.C. J.

The allocation of energy and metabolites for the massive synthesis and transport of Yops is demanding, and this burden is believed to be responsible for the observed growth inhibition (10Ramamurthi K.S. Schneewind O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 107-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To give an idea of the metabolic requirements, Yops are secreted to the culture supernatant in 10-mg amounts per liter of culture within 2 h after calcium depletion of the medium. Furthermore, post-translationally secreted substrates need to be unfolded by a T3SS-specific ATPase prior to secretion (11Woestyn S. Allaoui A. Wattiau P. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wilharm G. Lehmann V. Neumayer W. Trček J. Heesemann J.

Heesemann J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 297: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, T3SS-dependent transport of Yops requires the proton motive force (15Wilharm G. Lehmann V. Krauss K. Lehnert B. Richter S. Ruckdeschel K. Heesemann J. Trülzsch K. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4004-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, there is evidence that growth cessation and Yop expression can be uncoupled (16Brubaker R.R. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 4743-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Wiley D.J. Rosqvist R. Schesser K. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 373: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting a coordinated regulation of metabolism and protein transport rather than the LCR reflecting an inevitable physiological consequence. What are the candidate proteins that could be involved in such a coordination? YscM1 and YscM2 (57% identical to YscM1) are key candidates, since they act at a major nodal point of the T3SS regulatory network in Y. enterocolitica. In Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, only the YscM1 homologue LcrQ exists (99% identical to YscM1). YscM1/LcrQ and YscM2 are secretion substrates of the T3SS that are involved in up-regulation of Yop expression after host cell contact. Upon cell contact, the decrease of intracellular levels of YscM1/LcrQ and YscM2 due to their translocation into host cells results in a derepression of Yop synthesis (18Pettersson J. Nordfelth R.

It was shown that YscM1/LcrQ and YscM2 exert their influence on Yop expression in concert with the T3SS components SycH, SycD (LcrH in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis), and YopD (21Cambronne E.D.

It is further described that YscM1 and/or YscM2 interact with several of the T3SS-specific chaperones, in particular with SycH, SycE, SycD, and SycO (20Cambronne E.D. Cheng L.W. Schneewind O. Mol.

BMC Microbiol. 2007; 7: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This has led to the model that YscM/LcrQ proteins might function as an interface that senses whether chaperones are loaded with Yops and transduces these signals into control of Yop expression (14Wilharm G. Dittmann S. Schmid A. Heesemann J. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2007; 297: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These features of YscM1/LcrQ and YscM2 prompted us to speculate about a key role of these proteins in coordination of metabolism and expression of T3SS components. Using recombinant GST-YscM1 and GST-YscM2 as bait for Y. enterocolitica cytosolic proteins, we identified phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) as interaction partner of both YscM1 and YscM2. Under in vitro conditions, YscM1 down-regulated PEPC activity and bacterial growth/replication. Isotopologue profiling of Yop proteins and derived amino acids from Y. enterocolitica grown in the presence of [U-13C6]glucose showed the functionality of the PEPC reaction under virulence conditions (isotopologues are molecular entities that differ only in isotopic composition (number of isotopic substitutions); e.g. CH4, CH3D, and CH2D2). Moreover, biosynthetic rates of amino acids were increased in mutants defective in YscM1 or YscM2, suggesting a general role of these regulators in the metabolism of Y. enterocolitica. Recently, evidence has been accumulating that the metabolic state contributes to the regulation of T3SSs of diverse pathogens, also including the flagellar T3SS in Pseudomonas and Salmonella (32Dacheux D.

Cloning and Mutagenesis—For details on construction of plasmids and mutants, see below. Overproduction of YscM1 and YscM2 was based on plasmid pWS (37Locher M. Lehnert B. Krauss K. Heesemann J. Groll M. Wilharm G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31149-31155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and controlled by an isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside-inducible tac promoter. For purification of recombinant Yersinia PEPC, a GST fusion construct based on pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Plasmids for expression of GST-YscM1 and GST-YscM2 fusions have been described (38Wilharm G. Neumayer W. Heesemann J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The ppc mutant was generated as described (15Wilharm G. Lehmann V. Krauss K. Lehnert B. Richter S. Ruckdeschel K. Heesemann J. Trülzsch K. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4004-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) by replacement of the ppc gene with a kanamycin resistance cassette mediated by homologous recombination of a transformed PCR product. The primers used were 5′-CTAACAACCCTGCGGCGTCAAGGGCGAAGGGGATATGGGTCAGGGGTCATTCACTGACACCCTCATCAGTG-3′ and 5′-ACGGGCGCCTGGCCCGTTTTGTCTTTTATTCACGATAATTCTACTGGCAACGTCAAGTCAGCGTAATGCTC-3′. Construction of yscM1 and yscM2 deletion strains was previously described (31Dittmann S. Schmid A. Richter S. Trulzsch K. Heesemann J. Wilharm G. BMC Microbiol. 2007; 7: 67Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). After cleavage of pWS with NdeI and SalI, appropriate inserts with PCR-introduced NdeI and SalI sites, respectively, were ligated. As template, DNA from Y. enterocolitica WA-314 was used. For construction of pWS-YscM1 primers, 5′-CATATGAAAATCAATACTCTTCAATCG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCAGCCGTCAGCCG-3′ were used; for pWS-YscM2 construction, primers 5′-CATATGGGGAGCATTATGAAAAATAAACG-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTTAAAGCTTTTGCATTTTCCGTGTC-3′ were used. Primer design for YscM1 and YscM2 constructs was based on sequences with accession number AY150843. Y. enterocolitica ppc was amplified by PCR with primers 5′-GAATTCAATGAACGAACAATATTCCGCAATGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGCCGCTTAGCCGGTATTACGCATACCTG-3′ introducing EcoRI and NotI restriction sites, and the ppc fragment was ligated into EcoRI-NotI-digested vector pGEX-4T3. Protein Expression and Purification—YscM1 and YscM2 were fused to GST based on two vectors, pGEX-4T3 and pGEX-6P3 (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusions based on pGEX-4T3, which harbor a thrombin cleavage site, were used for initial PEPC binding studies (affinity purification and native gel electrophoresis). For production of recombinant YscM1/YscM2 without GST, pGEX-4T3-based constructs cannot be used, since YscM1/YscM2 harbor an intrinsic thrombin cleavage site (38Wilharm G. Neumayer W. Heesemann J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Therefore, recombinant YscM1 and YscM2 were produced as described using pGEX-6P3 as vector (38Wilharm G. Neumayer W. Heesemann J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Note, however, that GST-YscM1 and GST-YscM2 based on pGEX-6P3 were found to be incompetent to bind PEPC. GST-PEPC was overproduced from plasmid pGEX-4T3-YePEPC in BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Stratagene) at 27 °C after the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at an A600 of ∼0.8. Bacterial pellets were harvested after cultivation overnight and subsequently frozen. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol. GST-PEPC was bound to GSH-Sepharose 4 FF and cleaved on site with thrombin. PEPC washed from the matrix after cleavage was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200 (26/60) column equilibrated to 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol. GST was expressed from plasmid pGEX-4T3 and purified according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences). Affinity Purification and Identification of PEPC—Glutathione-Sepharose beads preloaded with GST fusions or GST as a control were incubated with lysates of Y. enterocolitica cells (WA-314, harboring the virulence plasmid pYV, and WA-C, a WA-314 derivative cured of pYV). Yersiniae were therefore cultured in brain heart infusion (BHI) medium at 27 °C (no expression of the pYV-encoded T3SS) and in parallel at 37 °C in the presence of 5 mm EGTA and 10 mm MgCl2 (expression and secretion of Yops). Harvested cells were resuspended in PBS and disrupted by French press treatment. Soluble fractions after centrifugation (20,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) were incubated with beads preloaded as described above at 4 °C for 1 h, and then beads were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Coomassie-stained bands of interest were excised from the gel. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (Reflex III; Bruker Daltonics GmbH, Bremen, Germany) was conducted as described recently (39Schlee M. Krug T. Gires O. Zeidler R. Hammerschmidt W. Mailhammer R. Laux G. Sauer G. Lovric J. Bornkamm G.W. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3941-3952Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) to identify PEPC as the ligand interacting with GST-YscM1 and GST-YscM2. Native Gel Electrophoresis—Native gel electrophoresis was performed as described (40Aepfelbacher M. Trasak C. Wilharm G. Wiedemann A. Trülzsch K. Krauss K. Gierschik P. Heesemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33217-33223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PEPC Activity Assay—PEPC activity was measured in a coupled reaction with malate dehydrogenase, as reported earlier (41Smith T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 128: 611-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Assay components were 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 5 mm PEP, 1 unit of malate dehydrogenase, and 5 milliunits of PEPC. The reaction was initialized by the addition of PEP, and assay mixtures were incubated at 27 °C. The decrease of NADH absorption was monitored at 340 nm in a 96-well Nunc plate using a microplate reader (Biomolecular Devices; SpectraMax software). ΔA340 was determined by linear regression (typically, the correlation coefficient was 0.98 or above). We ruled out an effect of YscM1 on activity of malate dehydrogenase in the coupled reaction. Growth under PEPC-requiring Conditions—Yersiniae (Y. enterocolitica WA-314) harboring plasmids pWS-YscM1, pWS-YscM2, and pWS were grown in rich medium overnight (BHI medium supplemented with 1% glucose) 1 day after selection of transformants. The next day, bacteria were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in M9 minimal salts supplemented with 1% glucose, 0.01% casamino acids, and 10 μg/ml thiamine. Under these conditions, the ppc mutant was unable to grow. 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to all cultures at time 0 to induce overproduction of YscM1/YscM2 or as a control (WA-314 pWS). All experiments were performed in triplicate from independent cultures. Growth curves were determined by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Expression of the respective protein was controlled by Western blotting using polyclonal antiserum. It appeared crucial that these growth studies were performed the day after selection of transformants and that catabolite repression was maintained by the addition of glucose to selection plates and to overnight cultures to repress the tac promoter at best. Later analyses frequently resulted in a loss of YscM1 and YscM2 expression, suggesting a strong selection pressure of protein production. 13C Labeling and Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Secreted Yops—Yersinae overnight cultures grown at 27 °C in BHI medium were centrifuged, and the pellet was washed twice in F-12 cell culture medium (Invitrogen; composition given in Table S1). Pellets were resuspended in F-12 medium, and suspensions were adjusted to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.15. F-12 medium was then supplemented with 2% [U-13C6]glucose or alternatively with 2% unlabeled glucose. To initially suppress secretion of Yops, the medium was supplemented with 0.2 mm CaCl2. Cultures (3 ml) were grown for 2 h at 37 °C to stimulate expression of the T3SS, and then cultures were stimulated to secrete Yops by the addition of 5 mm EGTA and 10 mm MgCl2. After 2 h of additional incubation at 37 °C, supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and the secreted proteins were precipitated with 10% tricarboxylic acid. Following separation on denaturing SDS gels, the Coomassie-stained protein bands corresponding to YopM, YopE, and YopH were excised from the gel, and the proteins were subjected to in-gel tryptic digestion and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. To this end, Coomassie-stained protein bands from SDS gels were washed twice with water and twice with 40 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.0. After 2-fold treatment with 50% acetonitrile for 5 min, trypsin (sequencing grade modified; Promega) was added, and proteins were digested overnight in 40 mm NH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C while shaking. Probes were directly used for MALDI-TOF experiments. 10 μl of each sample were first purified and concentrated on a C18 reversed phase pipette tip (Zip-Tip; Millipore). The peptides were eluted with 1 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma) and then directly spotted on a MALDI sample plate (Applied Biosystems). MALDI-TOF measurements were performed on a Voyager-DE STR TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems). The resulting spectra where displayed using the Data Explorer Software (Applied Biosystems). When we became aware of the seemingly strong selection pressure relating to the YscM1 and YscM2 expression constructs (see above), we reasoned that the yscM1 and yscM2 deletion mutants may rapidly change genetically. On that account, we isolated the virulence plasmid of the yscM1 and yscM2 mutant, respectively, and transformed it into the plasmidcured derivative WA-C of the parental strain WA-314, as recently described for Yop mutants (42Trülzsch K. Sporleder T. Igwe E.I. Rüssmann H. Heesemann J. Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). 13C Labeling and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry Analysis of the Protein-derived Amino Acids—Yersinae cultures (200 ml) grown at 27 °C in BHI medium overnight were centrifuged, and the pellet was washed twice in F-12 cell culture medium (Invitrogen). Pellets were resuspended in F-12 medium, and 5-liter suspensions were adjusted to an optical density (600 nm) of 0.15. F-12 medium was supplemented with 0.2% [U-13C6]glucose or alternatively with 0.2% unlabeled glucose. The medium was supplemented with 0.2 mm CaCl2 to suppress secretion of Yops initially. 5-liter cultures were grown in a pH-controlled BIOSTAT B fermenter for 2 h at 37 °C, and then cultures were stimulated to secrete Yops by the addition of 5 mm EGTA and 10 mm MgCl2. After 2 h of additional incubation at 37 °C, bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation, frozen, and lyophilized. For gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis, 5 mg of bacterial cell mass were hydrolyzed in 6 m HCl. The hydrolysate was dried and treated with N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-N-methyl-trifluoroacetamide containing 1% tert-butyldimethylsilylchloride. The resulting tert-butyldimethylsilyl derivatives of amino acids were subjected to GC/MS, as described earlier (43Eylert E. Schär J. Mertins S. Stoll R. Bacher A. Goebel W. Eisenreich W. Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 69: 1008-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed at least three times. Data were processed as described before (44Lee W.N. Byerley L.O. Bergner E.A. Edmond J. Biol. Mass. Spectrom. 1991; 20: 451-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), affording the molar excess of carbon isotopomer groups (M + 1, M + 2,... M + n, with M being the mass ion of the fragment under study and n being the number of carbon atoms of the respective fragment). The excess of multiple labeled isotopologues was calculated according to the equation, (2 × (M + 2) + 3 × (M + 3) +... + n × (M + n))/n. Small Angle X-ray Scattering Experiments and Data Analysis—The synchrotron radiation x-ray scattering data of PEPC alone, PEPC in complex with YscM1, and PEPC in complex with YscM2 were collected following standard procedures on the small angle scattering beamline X33 (45Roessle M.W. Klaering R. Ristau U. Robrahn B. Jahn D. Gehrmann T. Konarev P. Round A. Fiedler S. Hermes C. Svergun D. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2007; 4: s190-s194Crossref Scopus (220) Google Scholar) of the EMBL Hamburg on the storage ring DORIS III of the Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron. Details of data recording and processing are described in the supplemental material. The PEPC scattering was recorded at 2.4 mg/ml. PEPC-YscM1 and PEPC-YscM2 complexes were measured at a PEPC concentration of 0.6 and 1.6 mg/ml of the respective YscM protein. Protein solutions were equilibrated to phosphate-buffered saline using PD-10 cartridges for buffer exchange (GE Healthcare). YscM1 and YscM2 Interact with PEPC—In order to identify interaction partners of YscM1 and YscM2, we incubated glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions GST-YscM1 and GST-YscM2 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads with different yersiniae lysates. To this end, Y. enterocolitica strain WA-314 (9Heesemann J. Algermissen B. Laufs R. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 105-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), harboring the virulence plasmid pYV, and a plasmid-cured derivative (WA-C) were cultivated under conditions either permissive or restrictive for Yop expression and secretion (46Heesemann J. Gross U. Schmidt N. Laufs R. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 561-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beads were analyzed by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. S1). We detected one band of ∼95 kDa that was associated with GST-YscM1 and GST-YscM2 samples but not with GST alone. The appearance of this band did not depend on expression of the T3SS or the presence of the virulence plasmid, indicating a chromosomally encoded protein bound to YscM1 and YscM2. This protein was identified by mass spectrometry to be PEPC (data not shown). To prove the relevance of this finding, we recombinantly expressed Y. enterocolitica PEPC in Escherichia coli and purified the protein to facilitate interaction studies. Subsequently, we performed native gel electrophoresis to test binding of recombinant PEPC to recombinant YscM1 and YscM2, respectively. Fig. 1A displays a Coomassie-stained native gel, demonstrating that GST-YscM1 causes a mobility shift of PEPC. PEPC mobility was also shifted in the presence of YscM1 released from GST (Fig. 1B). Electrophoretic mobility of PEPC was only slightly retarded when it was incubated with YscM2 prior to gel loading. Therefore, the native gel was electroblotted to verify the YscM2/PEPC interaction (Fig. 1C). The same blot was developed with anti-PEPC and anti-YscM2 sera successively. YscM2, when loaded alone, could not be detected, because YscM2 did not enter the gel under the conditions applied (38Wilharm G. Neumayer W. Heesemann J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This is due to the basic isoelectric point of YscM2 (9.79) and a pH of 7.4 of the native gel system. However, when a mixture of PEPC and YscM2 was applied on the gel, YscM2 co-localized with PEPC and could be detected after immunoblotting. Taken together, recombinant PEPC interacts with recombinant YscM1 and YscM2, respectively. PEPC Activity Is Inhibited by YscM1 but Not by YscM"
https://openalex.org/W2139219758,"Anaerobic degradation of complex organic compounds by microorganisms is crucial for development of innovative biotechnologies for bioethanol production and for efficient degradation of environmental pollutants. In natural environments, the degradation is usually accomplished by syntrophic consortia comprised of different bacterial species. This strategy allows consortium organisms to reduce efforts required for maintenance of the redox homeostasis at each syntrophic level. Cellular mechanisms that maintain the redox homeostasis during the degradation of aromatic compounds by one organism are not fully understood. Here we present a hypothesis that the metabolically versatile phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris forms its own syntrophic consortia, when it grows anaerobically on p-coumarate or benzoate as a sole carbon source. We have revealed the consortia from large-scale measurements of mRNA and protein expressions under p-coumarate, benzoate and succinate degrading conditions using a novel computational approach referred as phenotype fingerprinting. In this approach, marker genes for known R. palustris phenotypes are employed to determine the relative expression levels of genes and proteins in aromatics versus non-aromatics degrading condition. Subpopulations of the consortia are inferred from the expression of phenotypes and known metabolic modes of the R. palustris growth. We find that p-coumarate degrading conditions may lead to at least three R. palustris subpopulations utilizing p-coumarate, benzoate, and CO2 and H2. Benzoate degrading conditions may also produce at least three subpopulations utilizing benzoate, CO2 and H2, and N2 and formate. Communication among syntrophs and inter-syntrophic dynamics in each consortium are indicated by up-regulation of transporters and genes involved in the curli formation and chemotaxis. The N2-fixing subpopulation in the benzoate degrading consortium has preferential activation of the vanadium nitrogenase over the molybdenum nitrogenase. This subpopulation in the consortium was confirmed in an independent experiment by consumption of dissolved nitrogen gas under the benzoate degrading conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1979302289,"Background The most frequently observed major consequences of ionizing radiation are chromosomal lesions and cancers, although the entire genome may be affected. Owing to its haploid status and absence of recombination, the human Y chromosome is an ideal candidate to be assessed for possible genetic alterations induced by ionizing radiation. We studied the human Y chromosome in 390 males from the South Indian state of Kerala, where the level of natural background radiation (NBR) is ten-fold higher than the worldwide average, and that from 790 unexposed males as control. Results We observed random microdeletions in the Azoospermia factor (AZF) a, b and c regions in >90%, and tandem duplication and copy number polymorphism (CNP) of 11 different Y-linked genes in about 80% of males exposed to NBR. The autosomal homologues of Y-linked CDY genes largely remained unaffected. Multiple polymorphic copies of the Y-linked genes showing single Y-specific signals suggested their tandem duplication. Some exposed males showed unilocus duplication of DAZ genes resulting in six copies. Notably, in the AZFa region, approximately 25% of exposed males showed deletion of the DBY gene, whereas flanking genes USP9Y and UTY remained unaffected. All these alterations were detected in blood samples but not in the germline (sperm) samples. Conclusions Exposure to high levels of NBR correlated with several interstitial polymorphisms of the human Y chromosome. CNPs and enhanced transcription of the SRY gene after duplication are envisaged to compensate for the loss of Y chromosome in some cells. The aforesaid changes, confined to peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggest a possible innate mechanism protecting the germline DNA from the NBR. Genome analysis of a larger population focusing on greater numbers of genes may provide new insights into the mechanisms and risks of the resultant genetic damages. The present work demonstrates unique signatures of NBR on human Y chromosomes from Kerala, India."
https://openalex.org/W2047082383,"Background Organisms face trade-offs regarding their life-history strategies, such as decisions of single or multiple broods within a year. In passerines displaying facultative multiple breeding, the probability of laying a second clutch is influenced by several life-history factors. However, information about the mechanistic background of these trade-offs is largely lacking. Leptin is a protein hormone produced by white fat cells, and acts as a signal between peripheral energy depots and the central nervous system. In addition, leptin affects cells at all levels of the reproductive axis and plays a critical role in regulating the allocation of metabolic energy to reproduction. As such, it is possible that leptin levels influence the decision of whether or not to invest time and energy into a second clutch. Accordingly, we expect a treatment with exogenous leptin to result in an increased number of second broods. Methodology/Principal Findings At a later stage during the first brood, female great tits were treated either with long-term leptin-filled cholesterol pellets (the experimental birds) or with pellets containing only cholesterol (the control birds). We found that leptin-treated females were significantly more likely to have a second brood and that the earlier females were more likely to lay a second clutch than the late females. Conclusions/Significance As both timing of first brood and treatment with leptin were important in the decision of having multiple broods, the trade-offs involved in the breeding strategy most likely depend on multiple factors. Presumably leptin has evolved as a signal of energy supply status to regulate the release of reproductive hormones so that reproduction is coordinated with periods of sufficient nutrients. This study investigated the role of leptin as a mediator between energy resources and reproductive output, providing a fundamentally new insight into how trade-offs work on a functional basis."
https://openalex.org/W2047016838,"The protein family of kinesins contains processive motor proteins that move stepwise along microtubules. This mechanism requires the precise coupling of the catalytic steps in the two heads, and their precise mechanical coordination. Here we show that these functionalities can be uncoupled in chimera of processive and non-processive kinesins. A chimera with the motor domain of Kinesin-1 and the dimerization domain of a non-processive Kinesin-3 motor behaves qualitatively as conventional kinesin and moves processively in TIRF and bead motility assays, suggesting that spatial proximity of two Kinein-1 motor domains is sufficient for processive behavior. In the reverse chimera, the non-processive motor domains are unable to step along microtubules, despite the presence of the Kinesin-1 neck coiled coil. Still, ATP-binding to one head of these chimera induces ADP-release from the partner head, a characteristic feature of alternating site catalysis. These results show that processive movement of kinesin dimers requires elements in the motor head that respond to ADP-release and induce stepping, in addition to a proper spacing of the motor heads via the neck coiled coil."
https://openalex.org/W2116399790,"Background In a recent controversial essay, published by JPA Ioannidis in PLoS Medicine, it has been argued that in some research fields, most of the published findings are false. Based on theoretical reasoning it can be shown that small effect sizes, error-prone tests, low priors of the tested hypotheses and biases in the evaluation and publication of research findings increase the fraction of false positives. These findings raise concerns about the reliability of research. However, they are based on a very simple scenario of scientific research, where single tests are used to evaluate independent hypotheses. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we present computer simulations and experimental approaches for analyzing more realistic scenarios. In these scenarios, research tasks are solved sequentially, i.e. subsequent tests can be chosen depending on previous results. We investigate simple sequential testing and scenarios where only a selected subset of results can be published and used for future rounds of test choice. Results from computer simulations indicate that for the tasks analyzed in this study, the fraction of false among the positive findings declines over several rounds of testing if the most informative tests are performed. Our experiments show that human subjects frequently perform the most informative tests, leading to a decline of false positives as expected from the simulations. Conclusions/Significance For the research tasks studied here, findings tend to become more reliable over time. We also find that the performance in those experimental settings where not all performed tests could be published turned out to be surprisingly inefficient. Our results may help optimize existing procedures used in the practice of scientific research and provide guidance for the development of novel forms of scholarly communication."
https://openalex.org/W2015258384,"The superficial resemblance of phylogenetic trees to other branching structures allows searching for macroevolutionary patterns. However, such trees are just statistical inferences of particular historical events. Recent meta-analyses report finding regularities in the branching pattern of phylogenetic trees. But is this supported by evidence, or are such regularities just methodological artifacts? If so, is there any signal in a phylogeny?In order to evaluate the impact of polytomies and imbalance on tree shape, the distribution of all binary and polytomic trees of up to 7 taxa was assessed in tree-shape space. The relationship between the proportion of outgroups and the amount of imbalance introduced with them was assessed applying four different tree-building methods to 100 combinations from a set of 10 ingroup and 9 outgroup species, and performing covariance analyses. The relevance of this analysis was explored taking 61 published phylogenies, based on nucleic acid sequences and involving various taxa, taxonomic levels, and tree-building methods.All methods of phylogenetic inference are quite sensitive to the artifacts introduced by outgroups. However, published phylogenies appear to be subject to a rather effective, albeit rather intuitive control against such artifacts. The data and methods used to build phylogenetic trees are varied, so any meta-analysis is subject to pitfalls due to their uneven intrinsic merits, which translate into artifacts in tree shape. The binary branching pattern is an imposition of methods, and seldom reflects true relationships in intraspecific analyses, yielding artifactual polytomies in short trees. Above the species level, the departure of real trees from simplistic random models is caused at least by two natural factors--uneven speciation and extinction rates; and artifacts such as choice of taxa included in the analysis, and imbalance introduced by outgroups and basal paraphyletic taxa. This artifactual imbalance accounts for tree shape convergence of large trees.There is no evidence for any universal scaling in the tree of life. Instead, there is a need for improved methods of tree analysis that can be used to discriminate the noise due to outgroups from the phylogenetic signal within the taxon of interest, and to evaluate realistic models of evolution, correcting the retrospective perspective and explicitly recognizing extinction as a driving force. Artifacts are pervasive, and can only be overcome through understanding the structure and biological meaning of phylogenetic trees. Catalan Abstract in Translation S1."
https://openalex.org/W2104867975,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) was overexpressed and purified from Escherichia coli. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were prepared that react with EBNA1. Eleven high affinity mAbs were recovered. Nine mAbs are isotype IgG (all subisotype IgG1) and two mAbs are isotype IgM. All mAbs react strongly with EBNA1 in an ELISA assay while only one mAb (designated 1EB6) fails to react in a Western blot assay. The epitopes for these mAbs were mapped to seven different regions, providing good coverage of the entire EBNA1 protein. The mAbs had differing affinity for an EBNA1/DNA complex with four mAbs able to supershift the complex completely. All mAbs can immunoprecipitate EBNA1 from E. coli overexpressing EBNA1. A modified ELISA assay, termed ELISA-elution assay, was used to screen for mAbs that release EBNA1 in the presence of a low molecular weight polyhydroxylated compound (polyol) and a nonchaotropic salt. MAbs with this property, termed polyol-responsive (PR)-mAbs, allow gentle elution of labile proteins and protein complexes. Four mAbs are polyol-responsive with two showing usefulness in gentle immunoaffinity chromatography. Purification with these PR-mAbs may be useful in purifying EBNA1 complexes and elucidating EBNA1-associated proteins. This panel of anti-EBNA1 mAbs will advance the study of EBV by providing new tools to detect and purify EBNA1."
