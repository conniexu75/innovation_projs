https://openalex.org/W2029066126,"The expression and function of the 8 distinct catalytic isoforms of PI 3-kinase (PI3K) in the nervous system are unknown. Whereas most PI3Ks have a broad tissue distribution, the tyrosine kinase-linked p110δ isoform has previously been shown to be enriched in leukocytes. Here we report that p110δ is also highly expressed in the nervous system. Inactivation of p110δ in mice did not affect gross neuronal development but led to an increased vulnerability of dorsal root ganglia neurons to exhibit growth cone collapse and decreases in axonal extension. Loss of p110δ activity also dampened axonal regeneration following peripheral nerve injury in adult mice and impaired functional recovery of locomotion. p110δ inactivation resulted in reduced neuronal signaling through the Akt protein kinase, and increased activity of the small GTPase RhoA. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK, a downstream effector of RhoA, restored axonal extension defects in neurons with inactive p110δ, suggesting a key role of RhoA in p110δ signaling in neurons. Our data identify p110δ as an important signaling component for efficient axonal elongation in the developing and regenerating nervous system."

Several studies have suggested that 5-HT is involved in bone metabolism. Starting from our original observation of increased 5-HT(2B) receptor (5-HT(2B)R) expression during in vitro osteoblast differentiation, we investigated a putative bone phenotype in vivo in 5-HT(2B)R knockout mice. Of interest, 5-HT(2B)R mutant female mice displayed reduced bone density that was significant from age 4 months and had intensified by 12 and 18 months. This histomorphometrically confirmed osteopenia seems to be due to reduced bone formation because 1) the alkaline phosphatase-positive colony-forming unit capacity of bone marrow precursors was markedly reduced in the 5-HT(2B)R mutant mice from 4 to 12 months of age, 2) ex vivo primary osteoblasts from mutant mice exhibited reduced proliferation and delayed differentiation, and 3) calcium incorporation was markedly reduced in osteoblasts after 5-HT(2B)R depletion (produced genetically or by pharmacological inactivation). These findings support the hypothesis that the 5-HT(2B)R receptor facilitates osteoblast recruitment and proliferation and that its absence leads to osteopenia that worsens with age. We show here, for the first time, that the 5-HT(2B)R receptor is a physiological mediator of 5-HT in bone formation and, potentially, in the onset of osteoporosis in aging women."

https://openalex.org/W2009975831,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a (STAT5a) is a critical transcription factor for a number of physiological processes including hematopoiesis and mammary gland development. Cytokines such as growth hormone, prolactin, erythropoietin, and interleukin-2 stimulate the activation of STAT5a by tyrosine phosphorylation. Tyrosine phosphorylation confers a conformational change and the ability to bind specific target DNA. To execute its function as a signaling molecule and transcription factor, accurate cellular localization of STAT5a is essential. This study explores the nuclear trafficking of STAT5a both before phosphorylation and after tyrosine phosphorylation. With the use of live cell imaging we demonstrate the continuous shuttling of STAT5a in and out of the nucleus. Evaluation of a series of mutations and deletions identifies a region within the coiled coil domain of STAT5a that is critical for nuclear import of both unphosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms. The mechanism that regulates transport of STAT5a through nuclear pore complexes into the nucleus is therefore independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. However, after tyrosine phosphorylation, STAT5a accumulates in the nucleus because of its retention by DNA binding. These findings should provide a foundation for further studies that involve targeting the activity of STAT5a."
https://openalex.org/W2075713674,"Megalin, the largest member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein family, functions as an endocytic receptor for a variety of essential lipophilic metabolites, including the steroid hormone estrogen. In the cochlea, megalin is strongly expressed within the marginal cells of the stria vascularis, and previous studies demonstrated that beta-estrogen receptors are also expressed in megalin-expressing marginal cells. In the present study, we demonstrate that homozygous megalin mutant mice exhibit profound hearing loss at 3 months of age associated with features of presbycusis, enrichment of lipofuscin granules, and a reduced number of microvilli in marginal cells of the stria vascularis. FITC-labeled beta-estrogen is taken up into the strial marginal cells; however, in megalin-deficient mice the uptake of FITC-labeled beta-estrogen is reduced. This highlights beta-estrogen as a possible carrier-bound candidate ligand for megalin and supports the concept that estrogen may function via megalin within the inner ear. A crucial role of megalin in hearing should be considered and the megalin/estrogen interaction needs to be discussed in the context of early presbycusis in estrogen-deficient humans and mice."
https://openalex.org/W2017695062,"CryAB and HSPB2 are small heat shock proteins constitutively expressed in the heart. CryAB protects cytoskeletal organization and intermediate filament assembly; the functions of HSPB2 are unknown. The promoters of CryAB and HSPB2 share regulatory elements, making identifying their separate functions difficult. Here, using a genetic approach, we report distinct roles for these sHSPs, with CryAB protecting mechanical properties and HSPB2 protecting energy reserve. Isolated hearts of wild type mice (WT), mice lacking both sHSPs (DKO), WT mice overexpressing mouse CryAB protein (mCryAB(Tg)), and mice with no HSPB2 made by crossing DKO with mCryAB(Tg) (DKO/mCryAB(Tg)) were stressed with either ischemia/reperfusion or inotropic stimulation. Contractile performance and energetics were measured using 31P NMR spectroscopy. Ischemia/reperfusion caused severe diastolic dysfunction in DKO hearts. Recovery of [ATP] and [PCr] during reperfusion was impaired only in DKO/mCryAB(Tg). During inotropic stimulation, DKO/mCryAB(Tg) showed blunted systolic and diastolic function and revealed massive energy wasting on acute stress: |deltaG(-ATP)| decreased in DKO by 6.4 +/- 0.7 and in DKO/mCryAB(Tg) by 5.5 +/- 0.8 kJ/mol compared with only approximately 3.3 kJ/mol in WT and mCryAB(Tg). Thus, CryAB and HSPB2 proteins play nonredundant roles in the heart, CryAB in structural remodeling and HSPB2 in maintaining energetic balance."

https://openalex.org/W2129079779,"Mechanical forces contribute to vascular remodeling processes. Elevated mechanical stress causes apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the media. This study examined the role of the cystein protease calpain in force-induced vascular cell apoptosis and its effect on injury-induced vascular remodeling processes. VSMCs were exposed to cyclic tensile force in vitro, which resulted in increased p53 protein expression and transcriptional activity as well as a significant increase of apoptotic VSMCs. Apoptosis was prevented by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin and by p53 antisense oligonucleotides, indicating dependency of force-induced apoptosis on p53. Simultaneously, calpain activity increased by mechanical stress. Prevention of calpain activation by calpeptin or antisense oligonucleotides augmented strain-induced p53 expression and transcriptional activity, resulting in a further increase of apoptotic rate. p53 protein was directly disintegrated by activated calpain. The in vivo relevance of the findings was tested: pharmacologic inhibition of initial calpain activation augmented early apoptosis of medial VSMCs 24 h after balloon injury in a p53-dependent manner but resulted in a marked increase in late neointima formation. We conclude that calpain counteracts mechanically induced excessive VSMC apoptosis through its p53-degrading properties, which identifies calpain as a key regulator of mechanosensitive remodeling processes of the vascular wall."
