https://openalex.org/W2892203720,"Self-efficacy has been consistently found to be a protective factor against psychological distress and disorders in the literature. However, little research is done on the moderating effect of self-efficacy on depressive symptoms in the context of chronic pain. This cross-sectional study aimed to examine if pain self-efficacy attenuated the direct relationship between pain intensity and depressive symptoms, as well as their indirect relationship through reducing the extent of catastrophizing when feeling pain (moderated mediation). 664 community-dwelling Chinese older adults aged 60-95 years who reported chronic pain for at least three months were recruited from social centers. They completed a battery of questionnaires on chronic pain, pain self-efficacy, catastrophizing, and depressive symptoms in individual face-to-face interviews. Controlling for age, gender, education, self-rated health, number of chronic diseases, pain disability, and pain self-efficacy, pain catastrophizing was found to partially mediate the connection between pain intensity and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, the relationship between pain intensity and depressive symptoms was moderated by pain self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was also found to moderate the relationship between pain intensity and catastrophizing and the moderated mediation effect was confirmed using bootstrap analysis. The results suggested that with increasing levels of self-efficacy, pain intensity's direct effect on depressive symptoms and its indirect effect on depressive symptoms via catastrophizing were both reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that pain self-efficacy is a significant protective factor that contributes to psychological resilience in chronic pain patients by attenuating the relationship of pain intensity to both catastrophizing and depressive symptoms."

In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a country’s political landscape from Twitter data. Method The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media. This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene. Results We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena. Conclusions Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment; as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the “Politoscope”, a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way."

We previously identified an lncRNA, GAS8-AS1, that is located in intron 2 of GAS8. However, its involvement in HCC is still largely unknown. In this study, we report that both GAS8-AS1 and its host gene GAS8 act as HCC tumor suppressors. We found that expression of GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 is significantly decreased in HCC tissues and is associated with a poor prognosis among HCC patients. Interestingly, lncRNA GAS8-AS1 could promote GAS8 transcription. We detected a CpG island in the GAS8 promoter, but lncRNA GAS8-AS1 did not affect DNA methylation at this GAS8 promoter site. Moreover, we identified two GAS8-AS1–interacting proteins, mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), a histone 3 Lys-4 (H3K4) methyltransferase, and its partner WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5). RNA pulldown, ChIP, and RNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GAS8-AS1 is required for maintaining the GAS8 promoter in an open chromatin state by recruiting the MLL1/WDR5 complex and for enhancing RNA polymerase II activity and GAS8 transcription. Of note, GAS8-AS1–dependent GAS8 hyperactivation inhibited malignant transformation of hepatocytes.

We identified a significantly mutated lncRNA gene, GAS8-AS1, as a tumor suppressor in our previous study (20Pan W. Zhou L. Ge M. Zhang B. Yang X. Xiong X. Fu G. Zhang J. Nie X. Li H. Tang X. Wei J.

In this study, we show that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 directly interacts with mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1), which can specifically methylate histone 3 Lys-4 (H3K4) via forming a complex with WD-40 repeat protein 5 (WDR5) and other components and have pivotal roles in the transcriptional regulation of multiple downstream genes (21Wysocka J.

Interactions between lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and MLL1/WDR5 complex induce H3K4 methylation of tumor suppressor GAS8 promoter, facilitate RNA polymerase II (Pol II) recruitment, and consequently activate GAS8 expression. GAS8-AS1–dependent GAS8 hyperactivation inhibits malignant transformation of hepatocytes. Significantly suppressed expression of GAS8-AS1 is commonly observed in HCC and was associated with poor overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. Interestingly, restored expression of GAS8-AS1 leads to HCC cells to be more sensitive to sorafenib, a commonly used targeted therapy drug in advanced HCC patients. Our data reveal that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 is a novel HCC tumor suppressor in vivo and in vitro and provide a rationale for targeting GAS8-AS1, either alone or in combination with sorafenib, when treating HCC. We detected GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 expression in 82 pairs of HCC tissues and adjacent normal tissue specimens. Significantly decreased GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 expression in HCC tissues was found compared with normal tissues in Shandong cohort (both p < 0.05) (Fig. 1, A and B), which was validated in Jiangsu cohort and combined data (all p < 0.01) (Fig. 1, A and B). Interestingly, we found significantly positive correlation between GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 expression in tissue specimens from both Shandong cohort (Spearman’s correlation: HCC tissues, r2 = 0.33, p = 0.002; normal tissues, r2 = 0.16, p = 0.020) (Fig. 1C) and Jiangsu cohort (Spearman’s correlation: HCC tissues, r2 = 0.11, p = 0.026; normal tissues, r2 = 0.14, p = 0.009) (Fig. 1D). We also examined whether differential GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 expression impact HCC prognosis. As shown in Fig. 1E, patients with high GAS8-AS1 expression in HCC tissues had significantly longer OS time than those with low GAS8-AS1 expression in Shandong cohort (median OS, 34.0 versus 16.0 months; p = 0.036). Similar results were also found when patients were grouped with GAS8 expression in HCC tissues (median OS, 31.0 versus 16.0 months; p = 0.015) (Fig. 1E). We also evaluated the prognostic value of GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 expression in Jiangsu cohort and observed consistent results (GAS8-AS1: median OS, 40.0 versus 17.0 months; p = 0.012; GAS8: 39.0 versus 18.0 months; p = 0.027) (Fig. 1F). These data elucidated that GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 may be tumor suppressors during HCC development. To investigate how GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 are involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, we next investigated their impacts on biological behaviors of HCC cells. We first examined whether ectopic GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 could modulate cellular proliferation (Fig. 2, A–D). We found that overexpression of GAS8-AS1 can significantly reduce viability of HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells (Fig. 2, A and C). For example, there was 18.4 or 22.3% reduced viability of HepG2 or SMMC7721 cells at 72 h after transfection (both p < 0.01). Similarly, overexpression of GAS8 can significantly inhibit growth of HCC cells (Fig. 2, A and C). On the contrary, lncRNA GAS8-AS1 down-regulation with different siRNAs (siGAS8-AS1-1, siGAS8-AS1-2, and siGAS8-AS1-3) did significantly accelerate proliferation of both HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells compared with cells transfected with NC RNA (all p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, A and C). Similar results were observed in HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells with silenced GAS8 expression (all p < 0.05) (Fig. 2, A and C). Interestingly, GAS8 overexpression could reverse the growth acceleration phenotype induced by GAS8-AS1 silencing (Fig. 2E). We also monitored how GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 influence colony formation and found that both genes could significantly suppress colony formation of both HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells (all p < 0.01) (Fig. 2F and Fig. S1). These are in line with cell viability assays and supporting the tumor suppressor nature of GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 in HCC (Fig. S1). To gain insight into the functional relevance of lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 on cell proliferation suppression, we detected how they influence apoptosis and cell cycle progression of HCC cells (Fig. 3 and Figs. S2–S4). As shown in Fig. S2, ectopic lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 are able to induce significantly increased apoptosis of both HepG2 and SMMC7721 cell lines. Interestingly, lncRNA GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 significantly sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib, a widely used targeted drug treating advanced HCC (Fig. 3, A and C). On the contrary, HCC cells with suppressed GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 expression showed much less apoptosis rates compared with the NC RNA controls (Fig. S2). Similar results were observed in HCC cells treated with sorafenib (Fig. 3, B and D). However, neither GAS8-AS1 nor GAS8 could induce obvious cell cycle arrest (Figs. S3 and S4). We then investigated whether lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 impact HCC invasion and metastasis. The wound-healing assays indicated that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 impaired the motility of the HepG2 and SMMC7721 cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, siRNAs of GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 were capable of significantly accelerating migration of HCC cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Next, how lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 influence invasiveness of HCC cells was examined using the Matrigel invasion assay system. lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 could significantly reduce invasion ability of HCC cells (Fig. 4, C and D). Consistent with this, silencing lncRNA GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 also led to enhanced invasion ability of HCC cells (Fig. 4, C and D). To exclude the possibility that cell death contributes to the decrease in cell migration and invasion, we performed both migration and invasion assays within 24 h (Fig. S5), which is in line with results at 48 h. To evaluate the mechanistic rationale, we examined expression changes of two markers of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition after overexpression or silencing of GAS8-AS1 in HCC cells. Interestingly, GAS8-AS1 could significantly increase ZO-1 expression and reduce vimentin expression. Additionally, silencing GAS8-AS1 induced ZO-1 expression and promote vimentin expression (Fig. 4E). Positive correlation between lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 mRNA in tissue specimens suggested that expression of GAS8 is functionally linked to transcription of GAS8-AS1. Therefore, we first examined whether silencing endogenous lncRNA GAS8-AS1 impacts expression of GAS8 in HCC cells (Fig. 5A). Indeed, knockdown of GAS8-AS1 in HepG2 or SMMC7721 cells led to decreased mRNA and protein expression of GAS8 (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 might play an important regulatory role in expression control of GAS8 in HCC cells. To exclude the possibility that those siGAS8-AS1 duplexes may target the GAS8 pre-mRNA, we designed and synthesized three siRNAs targeting intron 1 of GAS8 (Table S2). It was found that these siRNA duplexes could not significantly change GAS8 mRNA expression (Fig. S6). We then evaluated cellular localization of lncRNA GAS8-AS1 in HCC cells to determine its detailed regulatory mechanisms on GAS8. After RNA was extracted separately from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HCC cells, lncRNA GAS8-AS1 expression was examined alone with S14 and U2 RNA. lncRNA GAS8-AS1 was predominantly found in the nuclear fraction, as was U2 RNA in HCC cells (Fig. 5B). As a result, we speculated that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 may impact epigenetics modification of a promoter region of GAS8 (i.e. DNA methylation or histone modification) and, thus, regulate its expression. There is a predicted CpG island in the promoter of GAS8 and covering a part of the 5′-flanking region, whole exon 1, and a part of intron 1 (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/seqstats/emboss_cpgplot/) 3Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

Programmatic access to bioinformatics tools from EMBL-EBI update: 2017.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28431173): W550-W55310.1093/nar/gkx273Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Considering that altered transcripted lncRNA may interfere with neighborhood DNA methylation, we detected whether suppressed GAS8-AS1 influences DNA methylation of the neighborhood GAS8 CpG island DNA methylation in HCC. As shown in Fig. S7, we found that silencing endogenous lncRNA GAS8-AS1 did not impact DNA methylation of the GAS8 CpG island in both HepG2 and HeLa cells. There are multiple peaks of H3K4 methylation modifications (especially H3K4me3 modification) at the promoter of GAS8 in HepG2 cells according to the ENCODE ChIP-Seq data (Fig. S8). We then tested the hypothesis that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 may impact H3K4me3 at the GAS8 promoter. After knockdown expression of endogenous lncRNA GAS8-AS1 (Fig. S9), significantly reduced H3K4me3 at the GAS8 promoter was observed (Fig. 5, C and D), indicating that endogenous lncRNA GAS8-AS1 expression is essential in maintaining hyper-H3K4 trimethylation of the GAS8 promoter. In support of this, silencing GAS8-AS1 led to decreased occupancy of RNA Pol II at the GAS8 promoter (Fig. 5, C and D), which may be due to reduced H3K4me3 modification at the GAS8 promoter. Accumulated evidence demonstrated that some lncRNAs alter epigenetic signatures through interactions with chromatin-remodeling enzymes. Accordingly, we predicted potential histone methyltransferase candidates that may interact with lncRNA GAS8-AS1 by the RPISeq software (http://pridb.gdcb.iastate.edu/RPISeq/)3 (38Muppirala U.K. Honavar V.G. Dobbs D. Predicting RNA-protein interactions using only sequence information.BMC Bioinformatics. 2011; 12 (22192482): 48910.1186/1471-2105-12-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). With lncRNA HOTTIP as the positive control, we found that GAS8-AS1 may interact with MLL1, a key H3K4 methyltransferase, and its partner WDR5 (Fig. S10). We reasoned that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 might guide the MLL1/WDR5 complex to the GAS8 promoter. To verify this hypothesis, we performed RNA pulldown to determine whether GAS8-AS1 and MLL1 or WDR5 form a RNP complex. In vitro-transcribed biotinylated transcripts of GAS8-AS1 or antisense GAS8-AS1 (negative control) were incubated with nucleus HepG2 cell extracts. The presence of MLL1 and WDR5 was examined by Western blotting. Pulldown with GAS8-AS1, but not with an antisense GAS8-AS1, was able to detect both proteins (Fig. 5E), indicating that MLL1 and WDR5 associate with GAS8-AS1 in the nucleus. Consistent with this, ChIP assays indicate that both MLL1 and WDR5 can directly bind to the promoter of GAS8 (Fig. 5F). In support of the notion that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 recruits the MLL1/WDR5 complex to the GAS8 promoter, knockdown of GAS8-AS1 significantly inhibited MLL1-mediated H3K4me3 of the GAS8 promoter and prevented GAS8 expression in HCC cells (Fig. 5F). To examine whether GAS8-AS1 physically interacts with the MLL1/WDR5 complex, we detected GAS8-AS1 in RNA extracted from the precipitated MLL1 protein or WDR5 protein in HepG2 cells. We found that there was an 8.5- or 2.9-fold enrichment for MLL1 or WDR5 compared with IgG (Fig. 5G). On the contrary, ectopic lncRNA GAS8-AS1 increased H3K4me3 modification, Pol II occupancy, and binding of MLL1 or WDR5 to the GAS8 promoter in HCC cells (Fig. S11). We evaluated the in vivo anti-cancer effects of GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 using HepG2 xenografts. It was found that tumor proliferation from xenografts with ectopic lncRNA GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 was significantly suppressed compared with the control HCC xenografts (both p < 0.01) (Fig. 6A). However, there were no significant differences in mouse weight between GAS8-AS1, GAS8, and the control groups (Fig. 6B). Significantly reduced tumor weights of the GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 stable transfected xenografts were observed compared with those of the control xenografts (both p < 0.01) (Fig. 6C). In support of that, elevated expression of GAS8-AS1 or GAS8, decreased Ki67 IHC staining, and increased GAS8 protein expression were found in the GAS8-AS1 or GAS8 xenografts (Fig. 6, D and E). A working model summarizing relationships between the lncRNA GAS8-AS1-GAS8 axis and tumorigenesis is shown in Fig. 6F. We first identified lncRNA GAS8-AS1 as a significantly mutated gene in thyroid cancer (20Pan W. Zhou L. Ge M. Zhang B. Yang X. Xiong X. Fu G. Zhang J. Nie X. Li H. Tang X. Wei J. Shao M. Zheng J. Yuan Q. et al.Whole exome sequencing identifies lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and LPAR4 as novel papillary thyroid carcinoma driver alternations.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25 (26941397): 1875-188410.1093/hmg/ddw056Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, little is known about its involvement and downstream signaling in HCC development. In the current study, we find that lncRNA GAS8-AS1 recruits the MLL1/WDR5 complex to the GAS8 promoter, induces elevated H3K4me3 modification, facilitates RNA Pol II enrichment, and consequently activates GAS8 expression for the first time. Significantly positive correlations between expressions of these two genes in tissue specimens support the key regulatory role of lncRNA GAS8-AS1 on GAS8 expression. A series of in vitro and in vivo gene gain or loss assays prove the tumor suppressor nature of GAS8-AS1 and GAS8 during hepatocarcinogenesis. In support of this, we observed significantly reduced expression of both genes in human HCC tissues compared with normal tissues. GAS8, previously known as “growth arrest–specific 11,” locates in chromosome 16, which is sometimes deleted in breast and prostate cancer (26Whitmore S.A. Settasatian C. Crawford J. Lower K.M. McCallum B. Seshadri R. Cornelisse C.J. Moerland E.W. Cleton-Jansen A.M. Tipping A.J. Mathew C.G. Savnio M. Savoia A. Verlander P.

GAS8 is commonly up-regulated in growth-arrested cells and is a candidate tumor suppressor. Consistently, we found that GAS8 can inhibit malignant characteristics, including proliferation, invasion, and metastasis, in HCC and thyroid cancer (20Pan W. Zhou L. Ge M. Zhang B. Yang X. Xiong X. Fu G. Zhang J. Nie X. Li H. Tang X. Wei J. Shao M. Zheng J. Yuan Q. et al.Whole exome sequencing identifies lncRNA GAS8-AS1 and LPAR4 as novel papillary thyroid carcinoma driver alternations.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2016; 25 (26941397): 1875-188410.1093/hmg/ddw056Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a genome-wide local ancestry approach identifies GAS8 and its genetic variants associated with chemotherapeutic susceptibility (27Wheeler H.E. Gorsic L.K. Welsh M. Stark A.L. Gamazon E.R. Cox N.J. Dolan M.E. Genome-wide local ancestry approach identifies genes and variants associated with chemotherapeutic susceptibility in African Americans.PLoS One. 2011; 6 (21755009)e2192010.1371/journal.pone.0021920Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In line with this, we also observed joint effects between GAS8 and sorafinib on inducing apoptosis of HCC cells. This could be due to the possibility that GAS8, an evolutionarily conserved microtubule-binding protein (28Nishimura N. Araki K. Shinahara W. Nakano Y. Nishimura K. Higashio H. Sasaki T. Interaction of Rab3B with microtubule-binding protein Gas8 in NIH 3T3 cells.Arch. Biochem.

Additionally, GAS8 has also been proved to be involved in cytoskeleton function (29Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Grandgenett P.M. Donelson J.E.

By contrast, the shifts induced by 0.5 mm H2O2 or other oxidants were much smaller. Monitoring of biotin–maleimide attachment to IP3R1 by LC–MS/MS with 71% coverage of the receptor sequence revealed modification of two cytosolic (Cys-292 and Cys-1415) and two intraluminal cysteines (Cys-2496 and Cys-2533) under basal conditions.

The three isoforms of the IP3R family contain an N-terminal ligand-binding domain, a central regulatory domain, and a C-terminal channel domain. The ligand-binding domain contains a suppressor domain (SD; residues 1–223) that acts to inhibit IP3 binding to the core binding domain (residues 224–604). Channel opening is stimulated when IP3 levels are elevated during agonist stimulation. An alternative mode of channel opening results from regulatory modulation of IP3Rs, which sensitize channels to basal or modest changes in IP3 levels. A well-documented example of IP3R sensitization results from channel oxidation produced by exogenous or endogenous redox modulators. The first redox agent reported to sensitize IP3R channels was the organomercurial preservative thimerosal (reviewed in Ref. 1Elferink J.G.

Although there is substantial evidence for the regulation of IP3Rs by redox state, there is very little known regarding which IP3R thiols are involved, the types of thiol modifications occurring in the intact cell, or how the channel is sensitized by redox modifications. Although changes in IP3R redox state are presumed to occur, they have never been directly measured. The present study is the first to measure the redox state of IP3R in intact cells treated with various oxidants and to apply proteomic methods to interrogate the redox state of individual thiols in the IP3R1 isoform, which contains a total of 60 cysteines. These studies identify 4 oxidized thiols under basal conditions and an additional 11 or 4 thiols, which become oxidized in cells exposed to thimerosal or H2O2, respectively. The functional relevance of these oxidations was investigated using cysteine mutants transfected into a HEK293 IP3R triple-knockout cell line. The results show that the redox-sensitive cysteines required for IP3R1 channel potentiation are predominantly clustered within the N-terminal suppressor domain. We have adapted a method originally described by Leichert and Jakob (20Leichert L.I. Jakob U. Protein thiol modifications visualized in vivo.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2 (15502869): e33310.1371/journal.pbio.0020333Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 21Leichert L.I. Jakob U.

The critical initial step is the lysis of cells directly in 10% TCA to prevent any alteration of thiol status. Precipitated proteins are solubilized under strongly denaturing conditions (0.5% SDS, 6 m urea), and free thiols are blocked irreversibly by reaction with 10 mm iodoacetamide (IAM). The samples are then reprecipitated with TCA, and any oxidized thiols are reduced with 10 mm DTT. A further TCA precipitation was used to remove the DTT, and free thiols on the receptor were reacted with PEG-maleimides of different sizes (2, 5, and 20 kDa). The resulting gel shifts can be measured on SDS–PAGE after immunoblotting for IP3R. HEK293 cells were used as an experimental system. These cells contain very low levels of IP3R1 and endogenously express IP3R2 and IP3R3 (22Wojcikiewicz R.J. Type I, II, and III inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors are unequally susceptible to down-regulation and are expressed in markedly different proportions in different cell types.J. Biol.

Data from gel-shift assays are shown in Fig. 1 (B–E) for HEK293 cells transfected with IP3R1. Reproducible, small shifts are observed with both MPEG-2 and MPEG-5 under basal conditions (Fig. 1B). These shifts are not artifactual because they are blocked by inclusion of DTT during the MPEG reactions (Fig. 1B) or by DTT pretreatment of the intact cells prior to lysate preparation (Fig. 1C, lanes 1–3). The addition of the oxidants H2O2 (0.5 mm; Fig. 1C, lanes 7–9) or thimerosal (50 μm; Fig. 1C, lanes 10–12) enhanced the shift observed with both MPEG-2 and MPEG-5. Thimerosal produced larger changes than H2O2, and the effect of both oxidants were not additive (Fig. 1C, lanes 13–15). There are 60 cysteines in the primary sequence of the rat IP3R1. Lysates prepared in the absence of IAM treatment allow maximum reactivity to be measured, but shifted bands were retained on the gel only for the small MPEG-2 (Fig. 1D). In principle, given the molecular weight of the MPEGs, the total number of cysteines involved can be determined from the magnitude of the shift, but quantitation is subject to several inaccuracies and assumptions. One of these is the unusual hydrodynamic properties of MPEG-2 and MPEG-5 that produces gel shifts on SDS–PAGE corresponding to 5 and 15 kDa, respectively (23Makmura L. Hamann M. Areopagita A. Furuta S. Muñoz A. Momand J. Development of a sensitive assay to detect reversibly oxidized protein cysteine sulfhydryl groups.Antioxid.

Taking this into account, the shifts with either MPEG-2 or MPEG-5 correspond to the presence of ∼5 oxidized cysteines/IP3R1 subunit under basal conditions and ∼10 and ∼20 oxidized cysteines/subunit in the presence of H2O2 and thimerosal, respectively (Fig. 1E). Previous studies have suggested that IP3Rs in hepatocytes are stimulated by GSSG (25Renard-Rooney D.C. Joseph S.K. Seitz M.B. Thomas A.P.

Changes in the GSH redox status of HEK293 cells in response to H2O2 and thimerosal are shown in Fig. 2A. Both thimerosal and H2O2 caused similar increases in GSSG levels, but only thimerosal caused a large drop in total glutathione (GSH + GSSG). In contrast to H2O2, thimerosal forms an ethyl mercury adduct with reduced thiols and is known to deplete GSH in other systems (26James S.J. Slikker 3rd, W. Melnyk S. New E. Pogribna M. Jernigan S. Thimerosal neurotoxicity is associated with glutathione depletion: protection with glutathione precursors.Neurotoxicology. 2005; 26 (15527868): 1-810.1016/j.neuro.2004.07.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Preincubation of cells with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis) reduced total GSH and GSSG levels but did not alter basal, H2O2, or thimerosal-induced gel shifts in IP3R (Fig. 2B). Diamide selectively oxidizes GSH to GSSG (27Kosower N.S. Kosower E.M. Wertheim B. Correa W.S. Diamide, a new reagent for the intracellular oxidation of glutathione to the disulfide.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1969; 37 (5353890): 593-59610.1016/0006-291X(69)90850-XCrossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). An IP3R gel shift was observed at concentrations of diamide (50 μm) that did not produce detectable elevations of GSSG (Fig. 2C). Higher diamide concentrations (250 μm), which caused large elevations of GSSG, only produced a small additional gel shift (Fig. 2C). Diamide and other oxidants such as menadione and t-butylhydroperoxide were no more effective than H2O2 (not shown). Overall, the data do not show a clear correlation of IP3R oxidation with the GSH redox state. Rapid reversibility of both the total GSH levels (Fig. 2D) and the gel shifts were observed when DTT was added to the cells after the thimerosal (Fig. 2E).Figure 2Additional characterization of IP3R redox responses. A, total GSH and oxidized GSH was measured after treatment for 10 min with H2O2 (0.5 mm), thimerosal (50 μm), thapsigargin (1 μm), the indicated concentrations of diamide, and 16 h preincubation with 0.25 mm BSO.

In the last two lanes, the DTT was added before the thimerosal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To get a comprehensive picture of the status of individual IP3R cysteines, we adopted a proteomic approach in which the denatured cell lysates prepared after sequential iodoacetamide and DTT treatment were incubated with biotin–maleimide instead of PEG-maleimide (Fig. 1A). The modified IP3R1 was then immunoprecipitated from the lysate, separated on SDS–PAGE, and silver-stained. The excised band was subjected to in-gel digestion with trypsin and processed for LC–MS/MS. The mass spectra were interrogated for cysteine containing peptides that were either modified with iodoacetamide (corresponding to reduced thiols) or modified with biotin–maleimide (corresponding to oxidized thiols). The compiled results from three independent experiments derived from control and thimerosal-treated cells are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1. The mean sequence coverage was 71 ± 2% and resulted in the detection of 41 of 60 total cysteines when trypsin was used for cleavage. We observed four cysteines that were oxidized under basal conditions: Cys-292, Cys-1415, Cys-2496, and Cys-2533. Two of these cysteines are cytosol-facing (Cys-292 and Cys-1415), and two are intraluminal (Cys-2496 and Cys-2533). Thus of the five intraluminal cysteines, only two were oxidized. In the presence of thimerosal, the cysteines oxidized under basal conditions remained oxidized, and an additional 11 cytosol-facing cysteines were identified as being oxidized. These were Cys-37, Cys-206, Cys-638, Cys-767, Cys-897, Cys-995, Cys-1298, Cys-1459, Cys-1522, Cys-1647, and Cys-1976. It should be noted, however, that only six of these cysteines were consistently oxidized in all three trials (boxed in Fig. 3 and underlined in Table 1). In the case of Cys-206 and Cys-2533, we were able to identify only the oxidized form of the peptides in the spectra from thimerosal-treated cells. However, with the other redox-sensitive cysteines, both the oxidized and reduced forms of the peptides were evident (Table 1). For several cysteines the observed oxidation events were rare and in some cases observed only once in the three trials. However, the frequency of oxidation events was much higher (35–100%) for the six cysteines that were reproducibly oxidized. Lysates from H2O2-treated cells were analyzed in two experiments (Fig. 3, yellow boxes, and Table 1). A total of six cysteines were oxidized in both trials with three residues found under basal conditions (Cys-1415, Cys-2496, and Cys-2533), and an additional three residues oxidized upon H2O2 addition (Cys-206, Cys-214, and Cys-1397). The residues repeatedly oxidized by thimerosal and H2O2 were conserved in all three IP3R isoforms, with the exception of the thimerosal-sensitive residue Cys-1459, which was present only in the IP3R1 isoform (Fig. 3).Table 1The cysteine residues oxidized by thimerosal in three independent trials are shown in greenTable 1The cysteine residues oxidized by thimerosal in three independent trials are shown in green To use a mutagenesis approach to assess the functional role of individual cysteines in redox-modulation of the IP3R channel, we chose to employ a recently created human HEK293 cell line from which all three IP3R isoforms have been deleted by CRISPR (28Alzayady K.J.

By contrast, robust carbachol responses are observed in WT cells, and Ca2+ signals can be restored in 3KO cells by transfection with IP3R1 DNA (Fig. 4B). Comparable gel shifts in response to thimerosal (50 μm) were observed in IP3R1 transfected WT or 3KO cells (not shown). To assay for redox potentiation of IP3R1, we pretreated the cells for 2 min with thimerosal. In initial trials, we observed that the use of concentrations of thimerosal of >20 μm induced by itself a delayed increase of cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 4C). This presumably reflects sensitization of IP3R1 to endogenous IP3 because the response to thimerosal was greatly blunted in untransfected 3KO cells (Fig. 4D). To be able to measure redox potentiation of carbachol responses, we chose to use a low concentration of thimerosal (10 μm), which allowed a stable baseline to be maintained during thimerosal pretreatment prior to stimulation by carbachol. The carbachol addition was combined with EGTA to chelate extracellular Ca2+ and ensured that only intracellular Ca2+mobilization was being measured. Under these conditions a thimerosal-induced potentiation of the Ca2+ signal was observed for WT IP3R1 at low subsaturating concentrations of carbachol (Fig. 4E) but not at a maximal dose of carbachol (Fig. 4F). IP3R1 in which the N-terminal 12 cysteines have been mutated to alanine (Cys-less) has been shown to be a functional channel that is insensitive to a stimulatory effect of thimerosal on [3H]IP3 binding (30Seo M.D. Velamakanni S.

In agreement with these studies, the Cys-less mutant failed to show thimerosal-induced potentiation of IP3R function in 3KO cells (Fig. 4, G and H). Thimerosal at higher concentrations has been found to inhibit IP3-mediated Ca2+ release (32Bultynck G. Szlufcik K. Kasri N.N. Assefa Z. Callewaert G. Missiaen L. Parys J.B. De Smedt H. Thimerosal stimulates Ca2+ flux through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1, but not type 3, via modulation of an isoform-specific Ca2+-dependent intramolecular interaction.Biochem. J. 2004; 381 (15015936): 87-9610.1042/BJ20040072Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It should be noted that in our studies, using 10–50 μm thimerosal, only stimulatory effects were observed. A selected group of cysteine mutants were further analyzed for redox potentiation. These mutants included the individual residues within the N-terminal Cys-less construct, as well as three residues that were reproducibly oxidized in the MS assays (C767S, C1415S, and C1459S), and a cysteine found only in the SI(+) alternatively spliced form of IP3R1 (C326S). Several of these mutants have been used in our previous studies (33Joseph S.K. Nakao S.K. Sukumvanich S. Reactivity of free thiol groups in type-I inositol trisphosphate receptors.Biochem. J. 2006; 393 (16173918): 575-58210.1042/BJ20050889Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The expression of new mutants in 3KO cells was verified by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). To quantitate potentiation we measured the ratio of Ca2+ responses in the presence and absence of thimerosal pretreatment using 0.25 μm carbachol as in Fig. 4C. The maximal response to 20 μm carbachol was also measured and normalized to the maximal response observed with WT IP3R1 DNA. The potentiation ratio and maximal responses for each of the mutants are shown in Fig. 5 (B and C), respectively. Five of the eleven mutants showed diminished potentiation by thimerosal. Of these, four showed a partial inhibition (C37S, C56S/C61S, C214S, and C326S), whereas C15S was almost as effective as the Cys-less in removing the potentiating effect of thimerosal. The majority of the mutants showed maximal carbachol responses that were comparable with the WT IP3R1, although several had significantly lower (e.g. C37S) or higher (e.g. C15S) responses (Fig. 5C). The variation in maximal responses may reflect different levels of functional receptors in the ER stores that may not be evident at the level of immunoblots. It should be noted, however, that the maximal responses did not correlate with diminished redox potentiation. The residues having no effects (colored orange in Fig. 5) include Cys-767, Cys-1415, and Cys-1459, which were all residues that were reproducibly oxidized in MS assays after thimerosal treatment, with Cys-1459 being constitutively oxidized even under basal conditions (Fig. 3). Three residues that are included in the Cys-less mutant but did not appear in the mass spectra (Cys-530, Cys-553, and Cys-556) were also without effect on redox potentiation. The location of the redox-sensitive and -insensitive residues, color-coded as in Fig. 5B, have been mapped to the cryo-EM structure of IP3R1 (34Fan G. Baker M.L. Wang Z. Baker M.R. Sinyagovskiy P.A.

The main conclusion is that the redox-sensitive residues are clustered within the first 225 residues.

https://openalex.org/W2890276122,"Running-related overuse injuries can result from a combination of various intrinsic (e.g., gait biomechanics) and extrinsic (e.g., running surface) risk factors. However, it is unknown how changes in environmental weather conditions affect running gait biomechanical patterns since these data cannot be collected in a laboratory setting. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a classification model based on subject-specific changes in biomechanical running patterns across two different environmental weather conditions using data obtained from wearable sensors in real-world environments. Running gait data were recorded during winter and spring sessions, with recorded average air temperatures of -10° C and +6° C, respectively. Classification was performed based on measurements of pelvic drop, ground contact time, braking, vertical oscillation of pelvis, pelvic rotation, and cadence obtained from 66,370 strides (~11,000/runner) from a group of recreational runners. A non-linear and ensemble machine learning algorithm, random forest (RF), was used to classify and compute a heuristic for determining the importance of each variable in the prediction model. To validate the developed subject-specific model, two cross-validation methods (one-against-another and partitioning datasets) were used to obtain experimental mean classification accuracies of 87.18% and 95.42%, respectively, indicating an excellent discriminatory ability of the RF-based model. Additionally, the ranked order of variable importance differed across the individual runners. The results from the RF-based machine-learning algorithm demonstrates that processing gait biomechanical signals from a single wearable sensor can successfully detect changes to an individual’s running patterns based on data obtained in real-world environments."
https://openalex.org/W2892329587,"Introduction The primary study aim was to determine if repeated exposure to trips and slips with increasing unpredictability while walking can improve balance recovery responses when predictive gait alterations (e.g. slowing down) are minimised. The secondary aim was to determine if predictive gait alterations acquired through exposure to perturbations at a fixed condition would transfer to highly unpredictable conditions. Methods Ten young adults were instructed to step on stepping tiles adjusted to their usual step length and to a metronome adjusted to their usual cadence on a 10-m walkway. Participants were exposed to a total of 12 slips, 12 trips and 6 non-perturbed trials in three conditions: 1) right leg fixed location, 2) left leg fixed location and 3) random leg and location. Kinematics during non-perturbed trials and pre- and post-perturbation steps were analysed. Results Throughout the three conditions, participants walked with similar gait speed, step length and cadence(p>0.05). Participants’ extrapolated centre of mass (XCoM) was anteriorly shifted immediately before slips at the fixed location (p<0.01), but this predictive gait alteration did not transfer to random perturbation locations. Improved balance recovery from trips in the random location was indicated by increased margin of stability and step length during recovery steps (p<0.05). Changes in balance recovery from slips in the random location was shown by reduced backward XCoM displacement and reduced slip speed during recovery steps (p<0.05). Conclusions Even in the absence of most predictive gait alterations, balance recovery responses to trips and slips were improved through exposure to repeated unpredictable perturbations. A common predictive gait alteration to lean forward immediately before a slip was not useful when the perturbation location was unpredictable. Training balance recovery with unpredictable perturbations may be beneficial to fall avoidance in everyday life."

Here, we determined crystal structures of the USP15 catalytic core domain, revealing a canonical USP fold, including a finger, palm, and thumb region. Unlike for the structure of paralog USP4, the catalytic triad is in an inactive configuration with the catalytic cysteine ∼10 Å apart from the catalytic histidine. This conformation is atypical, and a similar misaligned catalytic triad has so far been observed only for USP7, although USP15 and USP7 are differently regulated. Moreover, we found that the active-site loops are flexible, resulting in a largely open ubiquitin tail-binding channel. Comparison of the USP15 and USP4 structures points to a possible activation mechanism. Sequence differences between these two USPs mainly map to the S1' region likely to confer specificity, whereas the S1 ubiquitin-binding pocket is highly conserved. Isothermal titration calorimetry monoubiquitin- and linear diubiquitin-binding experiments showed significant differences in their thermodynamic profiles, with USP15 displaying a lower affinity for monoubiquitin than USP4. Moreover, we report that USP15 is weakly inhibited by the antineoplastic agent mitoxantrone in vitro A USP15-mitoxantrone complex structure disclosed that the anthracenedione interacts with the S1' binding site. Our results reveal first insights into USP15's catalytic domain structure, conformational changes, differences between paralogs, and small-molecule interactions and establish a framework for cellular probe and inhibitor development."
https://openalex.org/W2889839714,"RAB28, a member of the RAS oncogene family, is a ubiquitous, farnesylated, small GTPase of unknown function present in photoreceptors and the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). Nonsense mutations of the human RAB28 gene cause recessive cone-rod dystrophy 18 (CRD18), characterized by macular hyperpigmentation, progressive loss of visual acuity, RPE atrophy, and severely attenuated cone and rod electroretinography (ERG) responses. In an attempt to elucidate the disease-causing mechanism, we generated Rab28−/− mice by deleting exon 3 and truncating RAB28 after exon 2. We found that Rab28−/− mice recapitulate features of the human dystrophy (i.e. they exhibited reduced cone and rod ERG responses and progressive retina degeneration). Cones of Rab28−/− mice extended their outer segments (OSs) to the RPE apical processes and formed enlarged, balloon-like distal tips before undergoing degeneration. The visual pigment content of WT and Rab28−/− cones was comparable before the onset of degeneration. Cone phagosomes were almost absent in Rab28−/− mice, whereas rod phagosomes displayed normal levels.

Of note, the loss of PDE6D prevented delivery of RAB28 to OSs. Taken together, these findings reveal that RAB28 is required for shedding and phagocytosis of cone OS discs.

The expression levels of miR-3195 and miR-328-5p were higher in the severe TBI group than in the mild and moderate TBI groups. In summary, our study demonstrates different expression profiles in plasma miRNAs among patients with mild to severe TBI. A subset of seven miRNAs can be used for diagnosis of TBI.

https://openalex.org/W2890800456,"Ras proteins participate in multiple signal cascades, regulating crucial cellular processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. We have previously reported that Ras proteins are modified by sumoylation and that Lys-42 plays an important role in mediating the modification. In the current study, we further investigated the role of Lys-42 in regulating cellular activities of K-Ras. Inducible expression of K-RasV12 led to the activation of downstream components, including c-RAF, MEK1, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), whereas expression of K-RasV12/R42 mutant compromised the activation of the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling axis. Expression of K-RasV12/R42 also led to reduced phosphorylation of several other protein kinases, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Chk2, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Significantly, K-RasV12/R42 expression inhibited cellular migration and invasion in vitro in multiple cell lines, including transformed pancreatic cells. Given that K-Ras plays a crucial role in mediating oncogenesis in the pancreas, we treated transformed pancreatic cells of both BxPC-3 and MiaPaCa-2 with 2-D08, a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E2 inhibitor. Treatment with the compound inhibited cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner, which was correlated with a reduced level of K-Ras sumoylation. Moreover, 2-D08 suppressed expression of ZEB1 (a mesenchymal cell marker) with concomitant induction of ZO-1 (an epithelial cell marker). Combined, our studies strongly suggest that posttranslational modification(s), including sumoylation mediated by Lys-42, plays a crucial role in K-Ras activities in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2892351430,"Secreted proteins are important metabolic regulators in both healthy and disease states. Here, we sought to investigate the mechanism by which the secreted protein complement 1q-like-3 (C1ql3) regulates insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells, a key process affecting whole-body glucose metabolism. We found that C1ql3 predominantly inhibits exendin-4- and cAMP-stimulated insulin secretion from mouse and human islets. However, to a lesser extent, C1ql3 also reduced insulin secretion in response to KCl, the potassium channel blocker tolbutamide, and high glucose. Strikingly, C1ql3 did not affect insulin secretion stimulated by fatty acids, amino acids, or mitochondrial metabolites, either at low or submaximal glucose concentrations. Additionally, C1ql3 inhibited glucose-stimulated cAMP levels, and insulin secretion stimulated by exchange protein directly activated by cAMP-2 and protein kinase A. These results suggest that C1ql3 inhibits insulin secretion primarily by regulating cAMP signaling. The cell adhesion G protein-coupled receptor, brain angiogenesis inhibitor-3 (BAI3), is a C1ql3 receptor and is expressed in β-cells and in mouse and human islets, but its function in β-cells remained unknown. We found that siRNA-mediated Bai3 knockdown in INS1(832/13) cells increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Furthermore, incubating the soluble C1ql3-binding fragment of the BAI3 protein completely blocked the inhibitory effects of C1ql3 on insulin secretion in response to cAMP. This suggests that BAI3 mediates the inhibitory effects of C1ql3 on insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells. These findings demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism by which C1ql3/BAI3 signaling causes an impairment of insulin secretion from β-cells, possibly contributing to the progression of type 2 diabetes in obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2890470102,"Coral reef systems can undergo rapid transitions from coral-dominated to macroalgae-dominated states following disturbances, and models indicate that these may sometimes represent shifts between alternative stable states. While several mechanisms may lead to alternate stable states on coral reefs, only a few have been investigated theoretically. We explore a model that illustrates that reduced vulnerability of macroalgae to herbivory as macroalgae grow and mature could be an important mechanism: when macroalgae are palatable to herbivores as juveniles, but resistant as adults, coral-dominated and algae-dominated states are bistable across a wide range of parameter space. We compare two approaches to global sensitivity analysis to rank the relative importance of the model parameters in determining the presence and magnitude of alternative stable states, and find that the two most influential parameters are the death rate of coral and the rate of maturation of algae out of the vulnerable stage. The Random Forest approach for global sensitivity analysis, recently adopted by ecologists, provides a more efficient method for ranking the relative importance of parameters than a variance-based approach that has been used frequently by computer scientists and engineers. Our results suggest that managing reefs to reduce chronic stressors that cause coral mortality and/or enhance the growth rates of algae can help prevent reefs from becoming locked in a macroalgae-dominated state."
https://openalex.org/W2890539430,"The allosteric coupling of the highly conserved nucleotide- and substrate-binding domains of Hsp70 has been studied intensively. In contrast, the role of the disordered, highly variable C-terminal region of Hsp70 remains unclear. In many eukaryotic Hsp70s, the extreme C-terminal EEVD motif binds to the tetratricopeptide-repeat domains of Hsp70 co-chaperones. Here, we discovered that the TVEEVD sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic Hsp70 (Ssa1) functions as a SUMO-interacting motif. A second C-terminal motif of ∼15 amino acids between the α-helical lid and the extreme C terminus, previously identified in bacterial and eukaryotic organellar Hsp70s, is known to enhance chaperone function by transiently interacting with folding clients. Using structural analysis, interaction studies, fibril formation assays, and in vivo functional assays, we investigated the individual contributions of the α-helical bundle and the C-terminal disordered region of Ssa1 in the inhibition of fibril formation of the prion protein Ure2. Our results revealed that although the α-helical bundle of the Ssa1 substrate-binding domain (SBDα) does not directly bind to Ure2, the SBDα enhances the ability of Hsp70 to inhibit fibril formation. We found that a 20-residue C-terminal motif in Ssa1, containing GGAP and GGAP-like tetrapeptide repeats, can directly bind to Ure2, the Hsp40 co-chaperone Ydj1, and α-synuclein, but not to the SUMO-like protein SMT3 or BSA. Deletion or substitution of the Ssa1 GGAP motif impaired yeast cell tolerance to temperature and cell-wall damage stress. This study highlights that the C-terminal GGAP motif of Hsp70 is important for substrate recognition and mediation of the heat shock response. The allosteric coupling of the highly conserved nucleotide- and substrate-binding domains of Hsp70 has been studied intensively. In contrast, the role of the disordered, highly variable C-terminal region of Hsp70 remains unclear. In many eukaryotic Hsp70s, the extreme C-terminal EEVD motif binds to the tetratricopeptide-repeat domains of Hsp70 co-chaperones. Here, we discovered that the TVEEVD sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic Hsp70 (Ssa1) functions as a SUMO-interacting motif. A second C-terminal motif of ∼15 amino acids between the α-helical lid and the extreme C terminus, previously identified in bacterial and eukaryotic organellar Hsp70s, is known to enhance chaperone function by transiently interacting with folding clients. Using structural analysis, interaction studies, fibril formation assays, and in vivo functional assays, we investigated the individual contributions of the α-helical bundle and the C-terminal disordered region of Ssa1 in the inhibition of fibril formation of the prion protein Ure2. Our results revealed that although the α-helical bundle of the Ssa1 substrate-binding domain (SBDα) does not directly bind to Ure2, the SBDα enhances the ability of Hsp70 to inhibit fibril formation. We found that a 20-residue C-terminal motif in Ssa1, containing GGAP and GGAP-like tetrapeptide repeats, can directly bind to Ure2, the Hsp40 co-chaperone Ydj1, and α-synuclein, but not to the SUMO-like protein SMT3 or BSA. Deletion or substitution of the Ssa1 GGAP motif impaired yeast cell tolerance to temperature and cell-wall damage stress. This study highlights that the C-terminal GGAP motif of Hsp70 is important for substrate recognition and mediation of the heat shock response.

The Hsp70 family shares a highly conserved architecture, consisting of two individual domains, an N-terminal nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a C-terminal substrate-binding domain (SBD), connected by a flexible linker (see Fig. 1A) (3Bertelsen E.B.

Intensive research has revealed that the physiological functions of Hsp70 proteins are achieved by allosteric cooperation between the NBD and SBD driven by an ATP-hydrolysis functional cycle assisted by the co-chaperone heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) (4Zuiderweg E.R.

The SBD can be further divided into a substrate-binding β-sheet domain (SBDβ), an α-helical lid domain (SBDα), and a C-terminal intrinsically disorder region (C-IDR) (see Fig. 1A) (6Zhang P. Leu J.I.

There is highly regulated and coordinated interdomain communication between the SBD and NBD, mediated through an amino acid network and domain interfaces (7Mayer M.P. Kityk R.

The SBDα of Hsp70 family members generally consists of five α-helixes followed by a C-IDR at the extreme C-terminal end. The first α-helix rests on the SBDβ, and the last four α-helixes form a helix-bundle structure that acts as a lid to cover the SBDβ. The SBDα and C-IDR make up the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Hsp70. The Hsp70 NBD and SBDβ are highly conserved in all species, whereas the SBDα is less conserved, and the C-IDR is highly variable. 70-kDa heat shock protein heat shock protein 40 nucleotide-binding domain substrate-binding domain intrinsically disordered region C-terminal IDR C-terminal domain Protein Data Bank small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-interacting motif heteronuclear single quantum coherence chemical shift perturbation total correlation spectroscopy. The structure of the SBDα has been found to fluctuate during the functional cycle of Hsp70. The SBDα influences the affinity and kinetic interaction parameters of Escherichia coli DnaK with its substrate and is proposed to possess one or several sites for transient interaction with protein substrates, helping Hsp70 to refold proteins (9Mayer M.P. Hsp70 chaperone dynamics and molecular mechanism.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2013; 38 (24012426): 507-51410.1016/j.tibs.2013.08.001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The SBDα of Hsp70 is also crucial for binding to the J domain of the co-chaperone HSJ1a by providing a suitable conformation for binding, rather than directly binding to the J domain (10Gao X.C.

Up to now, the function of the C-IDR remains much less well-understood, in contrast to the increasingly detailed picture of the allosteric mechanism controlling substrate binding of Hsp70 (11Smock R.G.

Some eukaryotic cytosolic Hsp70s end with a conserved tetratricopeptide repeat domain interaction motif (-EEVD), which mediates binding with co-chaperones, such as Hsp40, CHIP, HIP, and HOP, that facilitate the assembly of a variety of Hsp70 complexes (11Smock R.G.

In studies of the effects of Hsp70 on amyloid fibril formation, it has been reported that the isolated Hsp70 SBD can inhibit the amyloid fibril formation of α-synuclein and Ure2, whereas the presence of the NBD modulates this fibril inhibition activity (14Pemberton S.

Ure2 is a nitrogen metabolism regulator in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which can give rise to the prion state [URE3] (17Wickner R.B. [URE3] as an altered URE2 protein: evidence for a prion analog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Science. 1994; 264 (7909170): 566-56910.1126/science.7909170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Ure2 contains two distinct domains, a relatively flexible N-terminal prion domain and a C-terminal globular functional domain (18Lian H.Y. Jiang Y. Zhang H. Jones G.W. Perrett S. The yeast prion protein Ure2: structure, function and folding.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1764 (16427819): 535-54510.1016/j.bbapap.2005.11.016Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The yeast Hsp70, Ssa1, is one of nine cytosolic Hsp70s (Ssa1-4, Ssb1-2, Sse1-2, and Ssz1) in S. cerevisiae (19Peisker K. Chiabudini M. Rospert S.

Ssa proteins are involved in a variety of cellular processes, such as translation, translocation, and general protein folding (20Frydman J.

SSA1 and SSA2 are constitutively expressed, and their gene products are 96% identical, whereas SSA3 and SSA4 are heat shock—inducible, and their gene products are both 80% identical to Ssa1 and Ssa2. Ssa1 can inhibit the fibril formation of the amyloid protein Ure2 without ATP (23Savistchenko J. Krzewska J. Fay N. Melki R. Molecular chaperones and the assembly of the prion Ure2p in vitro.J. Biol.

It also blocks Sup35 amyloid fibril formation in vitro with the assistance of the Hsp40 Ydj1 (24Krzewska J. Melki R.

Previous work in our lab demonstrated that in the absence of the NBD, the Ssa1 SBD can delay fibril formation of Ure2, whereas deletion of the C-IDR significantly decreases the inhibition activity, and further truncation of the α-helical bundle leads to further reduction in inhibition activity (16Xu L.Q. Wu S. Buell A.K. Cohen S.I. Chen L.J. Hu W.H. Cusack S.A. Itzhaki L.S. Zhang H. Knowles T.P. Dobson C.M. Welland M.E. Jones G.W. Perrett S.

This is similar to the case of human Hsp70, where the SBD alone can inhibit the fibril formation of α-synuclein, and the SBDα enhances the inhibition effect (15Huang C. Cheng H. Hao S. Zhou H. Zhang X. Gao J. Sun Q.H. Hu H. Wang C.C. Heat shock protein 70 inhibits α-synuclein fibril formation via interactions with diverse intermediates.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364 (17010992): 323-33610.1016/j.jmb.2006.08.062Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the role of the Ssa1 C-IDR and SBDα in Ure2 fibril inhibition is not clear. Here, we determined the NMR structures of the Ssa1 SBDα and SBDβ domains, which are the first structures for yeast canonical Hsp70s reported to date. Combining structural and biochemical results, we demonstrate that the Ssa1 C-IDR directly interacts with Ure2 through a 20-residue GGAP motif in the C-IDR, whereas the intact SBDα enhances the Ssa1 inhibition ability without directly binding to Ure2. Further, we detected a role of the GGAP motif in mediating response to stress in vivo. The domain structure of Ssa1 is shown in Fig. 1A. Previous results from our lab indicate that mutants of the Ssa1 SBD with different degrees of truncation of the SBDα have varying degrees of fibril inhibition ability, with Ssa1(382–554) ≈ Ssa1(382–582) < Ssa1(382–602) ≈ Ssa1(382–612) < Ssa1(382–622) ≈ Ssa1(382–642) (16Xu L.Q. Wu S. Buell A.K. Cohen S.I. Chen L.J. Hu W.H. Cusack S.A. Itzhaki L.S. Zhang H. Knowles T.P. Dobson C.M. Welland M.E. Jones G.W. Perrett S.

To obtain structural insight into the role of the SBDα and C-IDR in fibril inhibition, we first resolved the NMR structure of Ssa1(523–622) (Table 1), which represents the Ssa1 CTD lacking 20 residues of disordered sequence at the C-terminal end (Fig. 1A). This is the first reported structure of an SBDα domain for the Ssa family of yeast Hsp70s. The overall structure of Ssa1(523–622) compromises four α-helices (αB: 523–551, αC: 558–577, αD: 583–598, and αE: 599–605) and a flexible C-terminal tail (positions 606–622) (Fig. 1, B and C). This structure is similar to the same region in DnaK (PDB code 1DKZ) and HspA1A (PDB code 4PO2) (6Zhang P. Leu J.I. Murphy M.E. George D.L. Marmorstein R. Crystal structure of the stress-inducible human heat shock protein 70 substrate-binding domain in complex with peptide substrate.PLoS One. 2014; 9 (25058147)e10351810.1371/journal.pone.0103518Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 25Zhu X.

The helices αB–αE form an α-helical bundle, showing a 3.7 Å root-mean-square deviation compared with the SBDα of E. coli DnaK and a 1.5 Å root-mean-square deviation compared with the SBDα of human HspA1A (hHsp70) (Fig. 1C), indicating that the α-helical bundle of the yeast Ssa1 SBDα is more similar to that of hHsp70 than DnaK. This reflects the higher sequence identity (∼45%) between the SBDα of Ssa1 and hHsp70 versus identity of ∼25% between Ssa1 and DnaK. Interestingly, the αE in the α-helical bundle of Ssa1 seems to be slightly more compact than in hHsp70 but less compact than in DnaK (Fig. 1C).Table 1The experimental restraints and structural statistics for the 20 lowest energy structures of Ssa1 SBDα(523–622) and SBDβ(382–554)SBDα(523–622)SBDβ(382–554)Distance restraintsIntraresidue7151169Sequential451693Medium321310Long-range144839Ambiguous8001887Total24314898Hydrogen-bond restraints108100Dihedral-angle restraintsφ83115ψ83122χ166Total166303ViolationsNOE violations (>0.3 Å)00Torsion angle violations (>5°)00PROCHECK statistics (%)aResidues used to calculate PROCHECK statistics of SBDα(523–622) and SBDβ(382–554) include 523–622 and 392–542, respectively.Most favored regions96.589.1Additional allowed regions3.09.1Generously allowed regions0.20.8Disallowed regions0.31.0Root-mean-square deviation from mean structure (Å)Backbone heavy atomsAll residuebResidues used to calculate root-mean-square deviation values of all residues include 523–608 and 392–542, respectively.0.64 ± 0.100.82 ± 0.10Regular secondary structurecRegular secondary structure regions used here for SBDα(523–622) include residues 523–551, 558–577, and 583–605 and for SBDβ(382–554) include residues 397–402, 406–411, 419–427, 434–441, 451–459, 471–477, 483–489, 495–500, 509–521, and 523–531.0.56 ± 0.120.56 ± 0.09All heavy atomsAll residue1.09 ± 0.081.28 ± 0.09Regular secondary structure1.03 ± 0.090.94 ± 0.09a Residues used to calculate PROCHECK statistics of SBDα(523–622) and SBDβ(382–554) include 523–622 and 392–542, respectively.b Residues used to calculate root-mean-square deviation values of all residues include 523–608 and 392–542, respectively.c Regular secondary structure regions used here for SBDα(523–622) include residues 523–551, 558–577, and 583–605 and for SBDβ(382–554) include residues 397–402, 406–411, 419–427, 434–441, 451–459, 471–477, 483–489, 495–500, 509–521, and 523–531. Open table in a new tab We then titrated Ssa1(523–622) with Ure2, by monitoring the 2D 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 15N-labeled Ssa1(523–622). The NH peak intensity ratios for titration with Ure2 were mapped onto the structure of Ssa1(523–622) (Fig. 1B). Nine NH peaks, mainly corresponding to the region containing residues Gly609–Gly621 at the C terminus, show a significant decrease in intensity, indicating that this sequence can directly bind to Ure2. To further understand the role of the entire C-IDR of Ssa1 in the interaction with Ure2, we assigned the backbone resonances of Ssa1(523–642) (Fig. S1A), which contains the intact C terminus. Ssa1(523–642) was then titrated with Ure2, resulting in significant signal decrease of the NH peaks (Fig. 2, A and B). Chemical shift index analysis (Fig. S1B) and the negative steady-state HN-NOE value of Phe623–Asp642 (Fig. 2C) indicate that this segment is disordered; therefore a modeled structure of Ssa1(523–642) was derived based on the NMR-derived structure of Ssa1(523–622), onto which the titration result was mapped (Fig. 2D). We find that the NH peaks with decreased intensity during Ure2 titration mainly belong to a GGAP motif (sequence: 609GGAP GGAA GGAP GGFP GGAP628) in the flexible C-terminal region (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, the NH signal intensities for the segment 630APEAEGP636 did not decrease during Ure2 titration, although this is also a Gly/Ala/Pro-rich sequence. The dissociation constant (KD) for Ssa1(523–642) and Ure2 was measured as 14.7 ± 3.6 μm by FRET (Fig. 2E), demonstrating a direct interaction between Ssa1(523–642) and Ure2. This binding affinity is significantly weaker than that reported for Ure2 and full-length Ssa1 (KD ∼40 nm) (23Savistchenko J. Krzewska J. Fay N. Melki R. Molecular chaperones and the assembly of the prion Ure2p in vitro.J. Biol.

The GGAP motif may also contribute to the kinetics of the chaperone mechanism in similar ways as the C-IDR of DnaK (11Smock R.G. Blackburn M.E. Gierasch L.M. Conserved, disordered C terminus of DnaK enhances cellular survival upon stress and DnaK in vitro chaperone activity.J. Biol.

To confirm the interaction of the GGAP motif with Ure2, we further titrated the 15N-labeled peptide of the Ssa1 C-terminal GGAP motif, 609GGAP GGAA GGAP GGFP GGAP628, with Ure2. Significant intensity decrease of NH signals clearly confirmed that the isolated peptide can also bind to Ure2 (Fig. 2G). In addition to residues of the GGAP motif, Asp555 and Gln559 in loop L12 also give decreased intensities of NH signals because of addition of Ure2, but the intensity decreases do not occur for other L12 residues. Because the L12 loop is structurally close to the C-IDR (Fig. 2D), Asp555 and Gln559 may interact with Ure2. The N-terminal residues 524EEDEKE529 show slight chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) upon Ure2 addition (Fig. 2, D and F). These residues are all charged, with a net negative charge of −4. This means that these residues with CSP upon Ure2 addition may also have a nonspecific electrostatic interaction with Ure2. Because residues 524-EEDEKE-529 are located at the N terminus of the αB helix of the Ssa1 SBD and are located far from the substrate-binding site and the C-IDR in the structure, it seems unlikely that they contribute to substrate binding in the full-length Hsp70, except where the substrate has a long positively charged tail and can bind this negatively charged sequence. To investigate the interaction specificity of the GGAP motif with Ure2, we also titrated Ssa1(523–642) with yeast Ydj1 and SMT3, human α-synuclein, and BSA. NH-signal intensities of the C-terminal EEVD motif are significantly decreased because of the addition of Ydj1 at a ratio of 1:3, indicating a direct interaction between the EEVD motif and Ydj1 (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, the NH-signal intensities of the GGAP motif residues decreased by almost 50% after addition of Ydj1 (Fig. 3B), indicating a second binding site in the Ssa1 C-IDR for Ydj1. Titration of Ssa1(523–622) with Ydj1 at a ratio of 1:7 also decreased the NH-signal intensities of the GGAP motif residues by 40% (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the presence of the EEVD motif can enhance the binding of the GGAP motif to Ydj1 and that these two motifs bind Ydj1 combinatorially. Interestingly, the NH-signal intensities of the GGAP motif residues also decreased after addition of α-synuclein, without decrease of the NH-signal intensities of the EEVD residues (Fig. 3D). Unexpectedly, the NH-signal intensities of the C-terminal six residues (-TVEEVD642) decreased after addition of the SUMO-like protein SMT3, without decrease of the NH-signal intensities of the GGAP motif residues (Fig. 3E). The NH-signals of the C-terminal six residues (-TVEEVD) have a significant CSP caused by the addition of SMT3 (Fig. 3F). We then titrated 15N-labeled SMT3 with the C-terminal peptide of Ssa1 (-PEAEGPTVEEVD) and observed significant CSPs (Fig. S2, A and B). A dissociation constant (KD) of 240 μm was obtained by fitting the NMR titration data (Fig. S2C). The CSP results were mapped onto the SMT3 structure (PDB code 1L2N) (26Sheng W. Liao X. Solution structure of a yeast ubiquitin-like protein Smt3: the role of structurally less defined sequences in protein-protein recognitions.Protein Sci. 2002; 11 (12021447): 1482-149110.1110/ps.0201602Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) to identify the SMT3 binding site for the TVEEVD peptide (Fig. S2D). Residues with large CSPs form a hydrophobic cavity (Leu26, Ile35, Phe37, Ile39, and Ala51) surrounded by positively charged residues (Lys38, Lys40, Lys41, Arg46, Arg47, and Arg55). This site is same as the binding site in SMT3 for other proteins containing the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) (27Song J. Durrin L.K. Wilkinson T.A. Krontiris T.G. Chen Y. Identification of a SUMO-binding motif that recognizes SUMO-modified proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101 (15388847): 14373-1437810.1073/pnas.0403498101Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), indicating that the TVEEVD sequence of Ssa1 is a newly identified SIM. In a control experiment, the NH signals of Ssa1(523–642) did not show any significant CSPs or intensity decrease upon addition of BSA (Fig. 3G). Thus, the Ssa1 C-terminal GGAP motif has a degree of specificity to recognize certain interacting proteins, providing an additional interacting site within Ssa1 in addition to the SBDβ. After characterization of the role of the Ssa1 C-IDR, especially the GGAP motif (Gly609–Pro628) in Ure2 binding and fibril inhibition (16Xu L.Q. Wu S. Buell A.K. Cohen S.I. Chen L.J. Hu W.H.

As mentioned above, the inhibition ability of Ssa1 SBD truncations has been found to decrease with the degree of truncation (16Xu L.Q. Wu S. Buell A.K. Cohen S.I. Chen L.J. Hu W.H. Cusack S.A.

However, the structure of C-terminal truncation mutants of DnaK (PDB code 1BPR) and bovine Hsp70 (PDB code 1YUW) indicate that if only αB is present, it will collapse into the hydrophobic binding site of SBDβ (Fig. 4A).

Isolation of MP supercomplexes from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which are believed to contribute to cyclic electron flow (CEF) between the cytochrome b6f complex (Cyt-b6f) and photosystem I (PSI), proved difficult. We were unable to isolate a supercomplex containing both Cyt-b6f and PSI because in our hands, most of Cyt-b6f did not comigrate in sucrose density gradients, even upon using chemical cross-linkers or amphipol substitution of detergents. Assisted by independent affinity purification and MS approaches, we utilized disintegrating MP assemblies and demonstrated that the algae-specific CEF effector proteins PETO and ANR1 are bona fide Cyt-b6f interactors, with ANR1 requiring the presence of an additional, presently unknown, protein. We narrowed down the Cyt-b6f interface, where PETO is loosely attached to cytochrome f and to a stromal region of subunit IV, which also contains phosphorylation sites for the STT7 kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2891167004,"Purpose There is some controversy whether or not saccades change with age. This cross-sectional study aims to clarify the characteristics of reflexive saccades at various ages to establish a normative cohort in a standardized set-up. Second objective is to investigate the feasibility of saccadometry in daily ophthalmological practice. Methods One hundred healthy participants aged between 6 and 76 years underwent an ophthalmologic examination and saccadometry, using an infrared video-oculography device, sampling at 220 Hz. The reflexive saccades were evoked in four directions and three target displacements each (5°/15°/30° horizontally and of 5°/10°/20° vertically). Saccadic peak velocity, gain (amplitude/target displacement) and latency were measured. Results Mean peak velocity of saccades was 213°/s (± 29°/s), 352°/s (± 50°/s) and 455°/s (± 67°/s) to a target position 5°, 15°and 30° horizontally, respectively, and 208°/s (± 36°/s), 303°/s (± 50°/s) and 391°/s (± 71°/s) to a target position 5°, 10° and 20° vertically. The association between peak velocity and eccentricity proved to be present at any age in all four directions. We found no relevant effect of age on peak velocity, gain and latency in a fitted linear mixed model. However, latency becomes shorter during childhood and adolescence, while in adulthood it is relatively stable with a slight trend to increase in the elderly. Saccades are more precise when the target displacement is small. Isometric saccades are most common, followed by hypometric ones. All children and elderly were able to perform good quality saccadometry in a recording time of approximately 10 minutes. Conclusion The presented data may serve as normative control for further studies using such a video-oculography device for saccadometry. The means of peak velocity and the gain can be used independently from age respecting the target displacement. Latency is susceptible to age."

NAFLD is a potentially progressive disease that may lead to cirrhosis and liver cancer but is frequently underrecognized because subjects at risk are often not evaluated. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) is a reliable method for non-invasive quantification of liver fat. It has the advantage of simultaneous measurement of liver stiffness (LS), an estimate of liver fibrosis. There is no information on CAP in subjects with risk factors from primary care.To investigate the prevalence of hepatic steatosis, as estimated by CAP, in subjects from the community with metabolic risk factors and correlate findings with clinical and biochemical characteristics and LS.Population-based study of 215 subjects with metabolic risk factors without known liver disease identified randomly from a primary care center. A control group of 80 subjects matched by age and sex without metabolic risk factors was also studied. CAP and LS were assessed using Fibroscan.Subjects with risk factors had CAP values higher than those of control group (268±64 vs 243±49dB/m,p<0.001). Prevalence of severe steatosis (CAP> 280dB/m) in subjects with risk factors was 43%. In multivariate analysis, fatty liver index (FLI) and HOMA were independent predictive factors of severe steatosis. There was a direct correlation between CAP and FLI values (r = 0.52,p<0.001). Interestingly, prevalence of increased LS was 12.6% in the risk group vs 0% in the control group (p<0.001). Increased LS occurred predominantly in subjects with high CAP values.A high proportion of subjects with metabolic risk factors seen in primary care have severe steatosis. FLI could be used as a surrogate of CAP. Increased LS was found in a significant proportion of subjects with risk factors but not in control subjects."

Objective To assess the relationships between maternal feeding practices with dietary intakes and BMI in preschoolers in Asia using cross-sectional analysis in the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes) cohort. Participant settings Mothers (n = 511) who completed the Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire (CFPQ) and a semi-quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) when children were 5 years old. Statistical analysis Associations between 12 maternal feeding practices (mean scores divided into tertiles) and children’s dietary intakes of seven food groups and BMI z-scores were examined using the general linear regression model. Weight and height of the child were measured, and dietary intakes derived from the FFQ. Results Compared to those in the low tertile, mothers in the high tertile of modelling healthy food intakes had children with higher intakes of vegetables[+20.0g/day (95%CI:11.6,29.5)] and wholegrains[+ 20.9g/day (9.67,31.1)] but lower intakes of sweet snacks[-10.1g/day (-16.3,-4.94)] and fast-foods[-5.84g/day (-10.2,-1.48)]. Conversely, children of mothers in the high tertile for allowing child control (lack of parental control) had lower intake of vegetables[-15.2g/day (-26.6,-5.21)] and wholegrains[-13.6g/day (-22.9,-5.27)], but higher intakes of sweet snacks[+13.7g/day (7.7, 19.8)] and fast-foods[+6.63g/day (3.55,9.72)]. In relation to BMI at 5 years, food restrictions for weight was associated with higher BMI z-scores [0.86SD (0.61,1.21)], while use of pressure was associated with lower BMI z-scores[-0.49SD(-0.78,-0.21)]. Conclusions and implications Modelling healthy food intakes by mothers was the key feeding practice associated with higher intakes of healthy foods and lower intakes of discretionary foods. The converse was true for allowing child control. Only food restrictions for weight and use of pressure were associated with BMI z-scores."
https://openalex.org/W2898640746,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) is a tightly controlled process that sustains cell functions mainly by fine-tuning oxidative metabolism to cellular needs. The kinetics of Ca2+ fluxes across the mitochondrial membranes have been studied both in vitro and in vivo for many years, and the discovery of the molecular components of the MCU has further clarified that this Ca2+ uptake mechanism is based on a complex system subject to elaborate layers of controls. Alterations in the speed or capacity of the in-and-out pathways can have detrimental consequences for both the organelle and the cell, impairing cellular metabolism and ultimately causing cell death. Here, we report that pretreatment of deenergized mitochondria with low-micromolar Ca2+ concentrations for a few minutes markedly increases the speed of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake upon re-addition of an oxidizable substrate. We found that this phenomenon is sensitive to alterations in the level of the MCU modulator proteins mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1) and 2 (MICU2), and is accompanied by changes in the association of MICU1–MICU2 complexes with MCU. This increased Ca2+ uptake capacity, occurring under conditions mimicking those during ischemia/reperfusion in vivo, could lead to a massive amount of Ca2+ entering the mitochondrial matrix even at relatively low levels of cytosolic Ca2+. We conclude that the phenomenon uncovered here represents a potential threat of mitochondrial Ca2+ overload to the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2951892440,"The recent discovery that myosin has two distinct states in relaxed muscle-disordered relaxed (DRX) and super-relaxed (SRX)-provides another factor to consider in our fundamental understanding of the aging mechanism in skeletal muscle, since myosin is thought to be a potential contributor to dynapenia (age-associated loss of muscle strength independent of atrophy). The primary goal of this study was to determine the effects of age on DRX and SRX states and to examine their sex specificity. We have used quantitative fluorescence microscopy of the fluorescent nucleotide analog 2'/3'-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) ATP (mantATP) to measure single-nucleotide turnover kinetics of myosin in skinned skeletal muscle fibers under relaxing conditions. We examined changes in DRX and SRX in response to the natural aging process by measuring the turnover of mantATP in skinned fibers isolated from psoas muscle of adult young (3-4 months old) and aged (26-28 months old) C57BL/6 female and male mice. Fluorescence decays were fitted to a multi-exponential decay function to determine both the time constants and mole fractions of fast and slow turnover populations, and significance was analyzed by a t-test. We found that in females, both the DRX and SRX lifetimes of myosin ATP turnover at steady state were shorter in aged muscle fibers compared to young muscle fibers (p ≤ 0.033). However, there was no significant difference in relaxation lifetime of either DRX (p = 0.202) or SRX (p = 0.804) between young and aged male mice. No significant effects were measured on the mole fractions (populations) of these states, as a function of sex or age (females, p = 0.100; males, p = 0.929). The effect of age on the order of myosin heads at rest and their ATPase function is sex specific, affecting only females. These findings provide new insight into the molecular factors and mechanisms that contribute to aging muscle dysfunction in a sex-specific manner."

We generated Clec16a inducible knockout (KO) mice to examine the functional link between CLEC16A auto-inflammation and autoimmunity. Clec16a KO mice exhibited weight loss and thymic and splenic atrophy. Mitochondrial potential was lowered in KO mice splenocytes resulting in aggregation of unhealthy mitochondria in B, T, and NK cells. In Clec16a KO mice we detected disrupted mitophagy in splenic B and T cells. NK cells from Clec16a KO mice exhibited increased cytotoxicity. Incomplete mitophagy was attenuated with PI3K and/or MEK inhibition in Clec16a KO mice. Our results demonstrate a functional link between CLEC16A and disrupted mitophagy in immune cells and show that incomplete mitophagy predisposes the KO mice to inflammation. Taken together, loss of function variants in CLEC16A that are associated with decreased CLEC16A expression levels may contribute to inflammation in autoimmunity through disrupted mitophagy. Drugs modulating mitophagy reverse the process and may be effective in treating and preventing autoimmunity in individuals with risk associated CLEC16A variants."

Organic DNA-binding dyes are free of these drawbacks, but they lack specificity to mitochondrial DNA.

As such, museum collections are invaluable repositories for testing ecological and evolutionary hypotheses across the tree of life. Digitizing and broadly sharing the phenotypic data from these collections serves to expand the traditional reach of museums, enabling widespread data sharing, collaboration, and education at an unprecedented scale. In recent years, μCT-scanning has been adopted as one way for efficiently digitizing museum specimens. Here, we describe a large repository of 3D, μCT-scanned images and surfaces of skulls from 359 extant species of bats, a highly diverse clade of modern vertebrates. This digital repository spans much of the taxonomic, biogeographic, and morphological diversity present across bats. All data have been published to the MorphoSource platform, an online database explicitly designed for the archiving of 3D morphological data. We demonstrate one potential use of this repository by testing for convergence in skull shape among one particularly diverse group of bats, the superfamily Noctilionoidea. Beyond its intrinsic utility to bat biologists, our digital specimens represent a resource for educators and for any researchers seeking to broadly test theories of trait evolution, functional ecology, and community assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2891479850,"Aims This retrospective cohort study investigated whether clinical inertia, the failure to intensify treatment when required, exists in Japanese clinical practice, using the CoDiC® database. How and when patients with type 2 diabetes treated with basal insulin received treatment intensification was also described. Materials and methods Patients with type 2 diabetes who initiated basal insulin between 2004 and 2011 were eligible for inclusion. Patients with an HbA1c ≥7.0% (≥53.0 mmol/mol) after 180 days of basal insulin titration were eligible for intensification, and their treatment was followed for up to 1.5 years. Endpoints were time to intensification, changes in HbA1c, and insulin dose. Results Overall, 2351 patients initiated basal insulin treatment (mean HbA1c 9.4% [79.2 mmol/mol]), and 1279 patients were eligible for treatment intensification (HbA1c ≥7.0% [≥53.0 mmol/mol]) after the 180-day titration period. During the 1.5-year follow-up period (beyond the 180-day titration period), 270 (21%) of these patients received treatment intensification. In patients receiving treatment intensification, mean HbA1c decreased from 8.6 to 8.2% (70.5 to 66.1 mmol/mol) at end of follow-up. Treatment was intensified using bolus insulin in 126 (47%) patients and with premixed insulin in 144 (53%) patients. The estimated probability of intensifying treatment during the 12 months after recording HbA1c ≥7.0% (≥53.0 mmol/mol) was 22.8%, and 27.5% after 17 months. Mean end-of-follow-up daily insulin dose was 35.11 units for basal–bolus compared with 20.70 units for premix therapy. Conclusions This study suggests clinical inertia exists in basal insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes in Japan. Strategies are needed to increase the number of patients undergoing therapy intensification and to reduce the delay in intensification in Japan."

Many of the previous efforts in reducing readmission rate of patients have not been very successful because of ill-defined quality measures, improper data collection methods and lack of effective strategies based on data driven solutions.In this study, we analyzed the readmission data of patients for six major diseases including acute myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure (HF), coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), pneumonia (PN), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and total hip arthroplasty and/or total knee arthroplasty (THA/TKA) from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) program for the period 2012-2015 in context with the ownership structure of the hospitals.Our analysis demonstrates that the readmission rates of patients were statistically higher in proprietary (for profit) hospitals compared to the government and non-profit hospitals which was independent of their geographical distribution across all six major diseases.This finding we believe has strong implications for policy makers to mitigate any potential risks in the quality of patient care arising from unintended revenue pressure in healthcare institutions."

Parameters which might be expected to to be related to nutrient supply and so the health of disc cells (eg the porosity of the vertebral endplate, cell viability and cell density) and to disc extracellular composition (ie quantification of glycosaminoglycan disaccharides and hyaluronic acid molecular weight) and collagen organization, were analyzed. Three regions of the intervertebral disc (anterior annulus fibrosus, nucleus pulposus, and posterior annulus fibrosus) were examined.The old-aged group showed a decrease in content of sulphated and non-sulphated glycosaminoglycans relative to middle-aged and there were also alterations in the proportion of GAG disaccharides and a decrease of collagen fiber size. Hyaluronic acid molecular weight was around 200 kDa in all regions and ages studied. The anterior annulus differed from the posterior annulus particularly in relation to cell density and GAG content. Additionally, there were changes in the bony endplate, with fewer openings observed in the caudal than cranial endplates of all discs in both groups.Results show the cranial vertebral endplate is the main vascular source for the intervertebral discs. Hylauronic acid molecular weight is the same through the intervertebral disc after age of 50 years."

In order to identify important core mechanisms, there is a need to explore how interventions that combine physical, social, sensory, and cognitively challenging activities are perceived and experienced by the participants. This qualitative study, based on an interpretive interactionist perspective, explored the experiences of stroke survivors who participated in a group-based multimodal rehabilitation program based on rhythm and music.Within four weeks after completion of the multimodal rehabilitation program, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted on a single occasion with 15 purposively selected individuals (mean age 65, 8 men, 7 women). The interview duration was between 13 and 44 minutes. Qualitative content analysis with an inductive approach was used to analyze data. Three categories were identified, each containing several sub-categories: To be intellectually challenged (energy-consuming activity and coordinating multiple input and output), Perceived therapeutic benefits (motor skills, cognitive skills, emotional and psychological responses), and Pros and cons with social integration (fellowship, competing with others, and instructor characteristics). From these categories, an overall theme was derived: The multifaceted layers of multimodal stimulation. Enjoying music, being part of a group with peers, a skilled instructor, and being able to manage the challenging movements, were related to positive experiences. In contrast, negative experiences were associated with not being able to perform the exercises, and with group members who dominated the conversational space.This study shows that access to a multimodal rehabilitation program with rhythm and music as operating ingredients may contribute to positive experiences for many individuals in a late phase after stroke in terms of motor, cognitive, as well as emotional enhancements. Important components were the music, the social interaction, the challenging exercises, and the skilled instructor."

Additionally, multi-component drugs represented by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are demonstrating safety and efficacy in the management of HF. However, the potential mechanism is unclear, and the ambiguous clinical locations of TCM remain a hindrance to its extensive application. To meet this requirement, a precise investigation on the efficacy of multicomponent drugs against HF using the signature biomarkers-oriented approach was developed and applied to a conventional drug for cardiac disease, YiXinShu (YXS). On the basis of in vitro and in vivo efficacy evaluation of YXS against HF, and with the aid of proteomics and network pharmacology approaches, specific signatures regulated by YXS against HF were identified. YXS may show distinctive treatment features for those HF patients showing the elevation of fatty acid-binding protein 3 and cytoskeleton-associated protein 5, as well as other classic HF biomarkers.

The objective of our study was to assess the trends in polypharmacy and its associated factors in South Korea. This cross-sectional study used a nationwide sampled database between 2002 and 2013, including outpatients of all ages who received at least 1 prescription in the same period. Polypharmacy was defined as the concomitant prescription of ≥6 distinct medications on a single prescription at least once without a given duration. The yearly prescribing trends were calculated and plotted. We conducted comparative analyses to identify the changes in social gradients of polypharmacy between the first 2 years, 2002‒2003, and the final 2 years, 2012‒2013. We repeated logistic regressions for pediatrics <20 years of age and adults ≥20 years of age to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The distributions of polypharmacy in the respective periods were examined according to patient economic status (0 = most deprived and 10 = most affluent). The age-standardized prevalence of polypharmacy decreased from 65.8% in 2002 to 43.7% in 2013. Our study included 1,108,298 outpatients throughout 2002-2013. Pediatric patients aged 1-9 years had the highest number of medications among all age groups (mean: 5.1 ± 1.1 in 2002-2003 vs. 4.1 ± 1.1 in 2012-2013) in both periods. Changes in the association between deprivation and polypharmacy over 10 years were observed in adults (aOR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.62-0.75 in 2002-2003 vs. 1.60; 95% CI = 1.54-1.66 in 2012-2013) and pediatrics (aOR = 0.60; 95% CI = 0.52-0.68 in 2002-2003 vs. 1.07; 95% CI = 1.01-1.14 in 2012-2013) compared with those in the most affluent patients.

Methods We enrolled 52 healthy subjects, 20 to 40 years of age, and performed a prospective observational study. Both ONH and macula were imaged simultaneously using wide volume scan of the SS-OCT in the primary and different gaze positions. Horizontal eye movements were used to obtain OCT images in abducted and adducted eyeball positions. Multilateral 3-dimensional registration was used to process and analyze the images to measure the degree of ONH changes. Results The mean axial length (AXL) was 25.73 ± 1.42mm and the mean spherical equivalents was -4.49 ± 2.94 D (The proportion of high myopia was 39.4%). Significant morphologic changes were observed in the ONH during both abduction and adduction. In abduction, the overall ONH tissues were elevated, and the mean area of elevation was 115,134 ± 9,424 μm2 (p<0.001). In adduction, the mean areas from two perspectives, which were nasal or temporal, and peripapillary tissues or optic nerve cupping were 95,277 ± 73,846 μm2, 34,450 ± 44,948 μm2, -108,652 ± 91,246 μm2, and -30,581 ± 46,249 μm2, respectively. Elevation in abduction (overall, nasal cup segment, and temporal cup segment; R = 0.204, 0.195 and 0.225, p = 0.038, 0.047 and 0.021, respectively) and elevation of nasal peripapillary segments in adduction were positively correlated with AXL (R = 0.346, p<0.001). Conclusion We found significant morphologic changes in the ONH in both abduction and adduction and these changes were associated with AXL. Considering these morphologic changes as physical properties, it allows a better understanding of the biomechanical characteristics of the ONH."

More than 50% of people interpreted a ""very good"" chance of remission as greater than 80%, greater than 90% or 100%. The most preferred format of information was in both words and numbers (38% to 43%) followed by words alone (28% to 30%).Numeric risk information is understood by 17% to 65% of respondents, depending on the format. Interpretation of verbal risk information is highly variable, posing a risk of misunderstanding. Provision of information in both words and numbers may assist in aiding comprehension."
https://openalex.org/W2889721391,"The mechanism by which the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ubiquitin ligases sense stress to potentiate their activity is poorly understood. GP78, an ER E3 ligase, is best known for its role in ER-associated protein degradation, although its activity is also linked to mitophagy, ER-mitochondria junctions, and MAPK signaling, thus highlighting the importance of understanding its regulation. In healthy cells, Mahogunin really interesting new gene (RING) finger 1 (MGRN1) interacts with GP78 and proteasomally degrades it to alleviate mitophagy. Here, we identify calmodulin (CaM) as the adapter protein that senses fluctuating cytosolic Ca2+ levels and modulates the Ca2+-deρendent MGRN1-GP78 interactions. When stress elevates cytosolic Ca2+ levels in cultured and primary neuronal cells, CaM binds to both E3 ligases and inhibits their interaction. Molecular docking, simulation, and biophysical studies show that CaM interacts with both proteins with different affinities and binding modes. The physiological impact of this interaction switch manifests in the regulation of ER-associated protein degradation, ER-mitochondria junctions, and relative distribution of smooth ER and rough ER.—Mukheriee, R., Bhattacharya, A., Sau, A., Basu, S., Chakrabarti, S., Chakrabarti, O.

https://openalex.org/W2890264698,"To increase the efficacy of chemoradiation and decrease its toxicity in normal tissue, a new concept is proposed, local radiosensitizer delivery, which combines triggered release of a radiosensitizer from thermosensitive liposomes with local hyperthermia and radiotherapy. Here, key aspects of this concept were investigated in vitro I) the effect of hyperthermia on the enhancement of radiotherapy by ThermoDox (thermosensitive liposome containing doxorubicin), II) the concentration dependence of the radiosensitizing effect of doxorubicin and III) the sequence of doxorubicin, hyperthermia and radiotherapy maximizing the radiosensitizing effect.Survival of HT1080 (human fibrosarcoma) cells was measured after exposure to ThermoDox or doxorubicin for 60 minutes, at 37 or 43°C, with or without irradiation. Furthermore, cell survival was measured for cells exposed to different doxorubicin concentrations and radiation doses. Finally, cell survival was measured after applying doxorubicin and/or hyperthermia before or after irradiation. Cell survival was measured by clonogenic assay. In addition, DNA damage was assessed by γH2AX staining.Exposure of cells to doxorubicin at 37°C resulted in cell death, but exposure to ThermoDox at 37°C did not. In contrast, ThermoDox and doxorubicin at 43°C resulted in similar cytotoxicity, and in combination with irradiation caused a similar enhancement of cell kill due to radiation. Doxorubicin enhanced the radiation effect in a small, but significant, concentration-dependent manner. Hyperthermia showed the strongest enhancement of radiation effect when applied after irradiation. In contrast, doxorubicin enhanced radiation effect only when applied before irradiation. Concurrent doxorubicin and hyperthermia immediately before or after irradiation showed equal enhancement of radiation effect.In vitro, ThermoDox resulted in cytotoxicity and enhancement of irradiation effect only in combination with hyperthermia. Therefore hyperthermia-triggered radiosensitizer release from thermosensitive liposomes may ultimately serve to limit toxicities due to the radiosensitizer in unheated normal tissue and result in enhanced efficacy in the heated tumor."
https://openalex.org/W2891432262,"Oligomerization of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides has been considered as the crucially causative agent in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Etersalate, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory oral drug (United State Food and Drug Administration—Unique Ingredient Identifier: 653GN04T2G) was previously suggested to bind well to proto-fibrils of Aβ peptides in silico. Here, the effect of etersalate on the oligomerization of soluble Aβ16–22 hexamer (6Aβ16–22) were extensively investigated using temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations over ~16.8 μs in total for 48 replicas (350 ns per replica). The results reveal that etersalate can enter the inner space or bind on the surface of 6Aβ16–22 conformations, which destabilizes the hexamer. Etersalate was predicted to able to cross the blood brain barrier using prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion—toxicity (preADMET) tools. Overall, although the investigation was performed with the low concentration of trial inhibitor, the obtained results indicate that etersalate is a potential drug candidate for AD through inhibiting formation of Aβ oligomers with the average binding free energy of -11.7 kcal/mol."
https://openalex.org/W2889580975,"Assessing geographic patterns of species richness is essential to develop biological conservation as well as to understand the processes that shape these patterns. We aim to improve geographic prediction of tree species richness (TSR) across eastern USA by using: 1) gridded point-sample data rather than spatially generalized range maps for the TSR outcome variable, 2) new predictor variables (forest area FA; mean frost day frequency MFDF) and 3) regression models that account for spatial autocorrelation. TSR was estimated in 50 km by 50 km grids using Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) point-sample data. Eighteen environmental predictor variables were employed, with the most effective set selected by a LASSO that reduced multicollinearity. Those predictors were then employed in Generalized linear models (GLMs), and in Eigenvector spatial filtering (ESF) models that accounted for spatial autocorrelation. Models were evaluated by model fit statistics, spatial patterns of TSR predictions, and spatial autocorrelation. Our results showed gridded TSR was best-predicted by the ESF model that used, in descending order of influence: precipitation seasonality, mean precipitation in the driest quarter, FA, and MFDF. ESF models, by accounting for spatial autocorrelation, outperformed GLMs regardless of the predictors employed, as indicated by percent deviance explained and spatial autocorrelation of residuals. Small regions with low TSR, such as the Midwest prairie peninsula, were successfully predicted by ESF models, but not by GLMs or other studies. Gridded TSR in Florida was only correctly predicted by the ESF model with FA and MFDF, and was over-predicted by all other models."
https://openalex.org/W2890413342,"Memory enhancement and memory decline are two opposing cognitive performances commonly observed in clinical practice, yet the neural mechanisms underlying these two different phenomena remain poorly understood. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that the default-mode network (DMN) is implicated in diverse cognitive, social, and affective processes. In the present study, we used the retrosplenial cortex as a seed region to study the functional connectivity within the DMN in two animal models with opposing episodic memories, of which memory enhancement was induced by footshocks to mimic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and memory decline was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge to mimic sepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Our results showed that LPS challenge and footshocks induced opposing episodic memories. With regard to the imaging data, there were significant differences in the functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), insular lobe, left piriform cortex, left sensory cortex, and right visual cortex among the three groups. Post-hoc comparisons showed the LPS group had a significantly increased functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and mPFC as compared with the control group. Compared with the LPS group, the PTSD group displayed significantly decreased functional connectivity between the retrosplenial cortex and the right visual cortex, retrosplenial cortex, insular lobe, left piriform cortex, and left sensory cortex. In summary, our study suggests that there is a significant difference in the functional connectivity within the DMN between SAE and PTSD rats."
https://openalex.org/W2890011140,"Activation and transcriptional reprogramming of AR in advanced prostate cancer frequently coincides with the loss of two tumor suppressors, INPP4B and PTEN, which are highly expressed in human and mouse prostate epithelium. While regulation of AR signaling by PTEN has been described by multiple groups, it is not known whether the loss of INPP4B affects AR activity. Using prostate cancer cell lines, we showed that INPP4B regulates AR transcriptional activity and the oncogenic signaling pathways Akt and PKC. Analysis of gene expression in prostate cancer patient cohorts showed a positive correlation between INPP4B expression and both AR mRNA levels and AR transcriptional output. Using an Inpp4b−/− mouse model, we demonstrated that INPP4B suppresses Akt and PKC signaling pathways and modulates AR transcriptional activity in normal mouse prostate. Remarkably, PTEN protein levels and phosphorylation of S380 were the same in Inpp4b−/− and WT males, suggesting that the observed changes were due exclusively to the loss of INPP4B. Our data show that INPP4B modulates AR activity in normal prostate and its loss contributes to the AR-dependent transcriptional profile in prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2890875570,"Age at onset of walking has been shown as an early predictor of physical activity in infants and children. However, little is known about whether age at onset of walking may predict sedentary behavior (SB). The aim of the present study was to examine the association between the timing of onset of walking and objectively measured SB, and whether this association is mediated by moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) in children.The subjects were 388 elementary school children aged 6-12 years. Current weight and height data were collected. Birth weight and the age in months the child first walked independently were reported based on the parents' recall. Children's SB and physical activity were objectively measured using a triaxial accelerometer (Active style Pro HJA-350IT, OMRON). The following summary outcome variables were derived from accelerometer data: Time (min/day) spent in SB (≤1.5 metabolic equivalents [METs]) and MVPA (≥3.0 METs).The mean ± SD time (min/day) spent in sedentary was 376 ± 62 and MVPA was 67.6 ± 20.8. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that a later age at independent walking was associated with increased time spent in SB (β = 0.15, P < 0.001) and decreased time spent in MVPA (β = -0. 18, P < 0.001) after adjusting for gender, birth weight, current age, body weight, schools, and time spent wearing the accelerometer. When MVPA was introduced as a covariate in the model predicting SB, the association between the age at independent walking and time spent in SB was completely attenuated (β = 0.04, P = 0.215), while MVPA was significantly associated with SB (β = -0.61, P < 0.001).Our results indicate that infants who walked at a later age spent more time in SB in childhood, and this association is mediated by MVPA. Appropriate interventions which focus on increasing MVPA and thereby reducing SB may be beneficial in infants who demonstrate a later age at onset of independent walking."

Here, to address this question, we chose a domain from the invariant part of IgG, the CH2 domain. We found that compared with other Ig domains, the isolated CH2 domain is a surprisingly unstable monomer, exhibiting a melting temperature of ∼44 °C. We further show that the presence of an additional C-terminal lysine in a CH2 variant substantially increases the melting temperature by ∼14 °C relative to CH2 WT. To explore the molecular mechanism of this effect, we employed biophysical approaches to probe structural features of CH2. The results revealed that Lys101 is key for the formation of three secondary structure elements: the very C-terminal β-strand and two adjacent α-helices. We also noted that a dipole interaction between Lys101 and the nearby α-helix, is important for stabilizing the CH2 architecture by protecting the hydrophobic core. Interestingly, this interaction between the α-helix and C-terminal charged residues is highly conserved in antibody domains, suggesting that it represents a general mechanism for maintaining their integrity. We conclude that the observed interactions involving terminal residues have practical applications for defining domain boundaries in the development of antibody therapeutics and diagnostics.

https://openalex.org/W2890512904,"Trichogramma is a kind of egg parasitoid wasp that is widely used to control lepidopterous pests. Temperature is one of the main factors that determines the various life activities of this species, including development, reproduction and parasitism efficiency. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are highly conserved and ubiquitous proteins that are best known for their responsiveness to temperature and other stresses. To explore the potential role of HSPs in Trichogramma species, we obtained the full-length cDNAs of six HSP genes (Tchsp10, Tchsp21.6, Tchsp60, Tchsp70, Tchsc70-3, and Tchsp90) from T. chilonis and analyzed their expression patterns during development and exposure to temperature stress. The deduced amino acid sequences of these HSP genes contained the typical signatures of their corresponding protein family and showed high homology to their counterparts in other species. The expression levels of Tchsp10, Tchsp21.6 and Tchsp60 decreased during development. However, the expression of Tchsc70-3 increased from the pupal stage to the adult stage. Tchsp70 and Tchsp90 exhibited the highest expression levels in the adult stage. The expression of six Tchsps was dramatically upregulated after 1 h of exposure to 32 and 40°C but did not significantly change after 1 h of exposure to 10 and 17°C. This result indicated that heat stress, rather than cold stress, induced the expression of HSP genes. Furthermore, the expression of these genes was time dependent, and the expression of each gene reached its peak after 1 h of heat exposure (40°C). Tchsp10 and Tchsp70 exhibited a low-intensity cold response after 4 and 8 h of exposure to 10°C, respectively, but the other genes did not respond to cold at any time points. These results suggested that HSPs may play different roles in the development of this organism and in its response to temperature stress."
https://openalex.org/W2890950809,"Background Previous studies have investigated physical and psychosocial job exposures separately in relation to foetal growth. We therefore investigated if occupational lifting and psychosocial job strain interact to affect foetal growth and gestational length. We hypothesised that heavy lifting and high job strain would increase the risk of impacted foetal growth (small or large for gestational age) and preterm birth. Methods The cohort included 47,582 pregnancies from the Danish National Birth Cohort (1996–2002), where the woman was pregnant at 22 gestational weeks (GW), expected one child and worked ≥30 hours/week. Information on occupational lifting and psychosocial job strain was derived from an interview (16±3.0 GW). Data to calculate small and large for gestational age (SGA/LGA) and gestational length was retrieved from the Medical Birth Register. Interaction between lifting and job strain (Karasek’s model) was analysed by multinomial logistic regression. Results Overall, the adjusted regression analysis showed statistically significant interaction between lifting and job strain for SGA and LGA. For each additional 250 kg lifted/day, high strain women (high Demand/low Control) had increased odds of giving birth to a LGA-child (OR = 1.15; 95% CI 1.06–1.26), whereas women in the active group (high Demand/high Control) had increased odds of giving birth to a SGA child (OR = 1.12; 95% CI 1.03–1.23). When women lifting ≤1000 kg/day were excluded in the sensitivity analyses the interaction between lifting and job strain became insignificant. No interaction of lifting and job strain was found for gestational length. Conclusions The main findings may give some support to our hypothesis, as lifting in combination high with job strain increased the risk of giving birth to a LGA child. This finding was, however, not supported in the sensitivity analysis and no association of the interaction was found relative to gestational length."
https://openalex.org/W2891260068,"Efficient monitoring of organisms is at the foundation of protected area and biodiversity management. Such monitoring programs are based on a systematically selected set of survey locations that, while able to track trends at those locations through time, lack inference for the overall region being “monitored”. Advances in spatially-balanced sampling approaches offer alternatives but remain largely untested in marine ecosystems. This study evaluated the merit of using a two-stage, spatially-balanced survey framework, in conjunction with generalized additive models, to estimate epifauna cover at a reef-wide scale for mesophotic reefs within a large, cross-shelf marine park. Imagery acquired by an autonomous underwater vehicle was classified using a hierarchical scheme developed under the Collaborative and Automated Tools for Analysis of Marine Imagery (CATAMI). At a realistic image subsampling intensity, the two-stage, spatially-balanced framework provided accurate and precise estimates of reef-wide cover for a select number of epifaunal classes at the coarsest CATAMI levels, in particular bryozoan and porifera classes. However, at finer hierarchical levels, accuracy and/or precision of cover estimates declined, primarily because of the natural rarity of even the most common of these classes/morphospecies. Ranked predictor importance suggested that bathymetry, backscatter and derivative terrain variables calculated at their smallest analysis window scales (i.e. 81 m2) were generally the most important variables in the modeling of reef-wide cover. This study makes an important step in identifying the constraints and limitations that can be identified through a robust statistical approach to design and analysis. The two-stage, spatially-balanced framework has great potential for effective quantification of epifaunal cover in cross-shelf mesophotic reefs. However, greater image subsampling intensity than traditionally applied is required to ensure adequate observations for finer-level CATAMI classes and associated morphospecies."
https://openalex.org/W2889932314,"Neonatal immediate adaptation to extrauterine life depends mainly on adequate lung function, which is under the influence of previous fetal maturation and obstetrical condition, both acting to stimulate the efficient liquid removal from the pulmonary parenchyma during the immediate transition period. The objective of the present study is to identify chest radiographic changes of neonatal calves born under the influence of different duration of calving and obstetric assistance and correlate with clinical analysis and blood acid-base balance. Experimental groups were determined according to the duration of calving: 2 h (n = 16), 2-4 h (n = 16) and >4 h (n = 12), and additionally by two sub-groups: no-intervention calving (n = 22) and intervention calving (n = 22). Neonatal calves were evaluated for heart and respiratory rate at birth, 5 min, every 10 min until 90 min. Arterial acid-base balance was determined immediately after calving and thoracic radiographs were made at 10 min of life. Lung radiopacity was higher in the 2-4 hr Group compared to the 2 hr Group. When calving duration was greater than 4 hours, a significant respiratory depression was observed. Calving greater than 2 hours slower neonatal pulmonary clearance, 100% and 91.6% of the calves born in the 2-4 hr and >4 hr Groups, respectively, had mild to moderate lung parenchyma opacity. There was a positive correlation between lung radiographic changes and blood TCO2 and negative correlation between pulmonary opacity score and blood PaO2 and SO2. Hence, it is possible to infer that neonatal hypoxia during prolonged calving has an imperative influence on pulmonary fluid absorption in calves. In conclusion, calving greater than 2 hours impacts pulmonary function at birth, leading to altered lung gas exchange, pulmonary clearance, cardiac and respiratory pattern. Conversely, obstetric intervention when calving has duration greater than 4 hours is beneficial for neonatal oxygenation."

Previous studies of CD43-/- mice in viral models have demonstrated a role for CD43 in Th1/Th2 skewing, activation of Foxp3+ Treg, and T cell apoptosis. However, the role of CD43 during sepsis has never been tested. Thus, we interrogated the role of CD43 during sepsis using a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model, and found that CD43-/- mice demonstrated significantly worsened mortality compared to B6 mice following CLP. Phenotypic analysis of splenocytes isolated 24 h after septic insult revealed significantly increased apoptosis of central memory cells in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartments in CD43-/- septic mice compared to WT septic mice. Furthermore, CD43-/-septic mice exhibited a prominent Th2 skewing following sepsis relative to WT septic mice, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the frequency of IL-2+ CXCR3+ TH1 cells as a significant increase in the frequency of IL-4+ CCR4+ TH2 cells. Finally, septic CD43-/- animals contained significantly fewer CD25+ Foxp3+ TReg cells as compared to WT septic animals. Importantly, depleting CD25+ Treg eliminated the increased mortality observed in CD43-/- mice. Taken together, these data demonstrate an important role of CD43 in modulating immune dysregulation and mortality following sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W2889890126,"The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) possesses a large extracellular domain formed by a β-strand core enclosed by three peripheral α-helical subdomains, which have been dubbed thumb, finger, and knuckle. Here we asked whether the ENaC thumb domains play specific roles in channel function. To this end, we examined the characteristics of channels lacking a thumb domain in an individual ENaC subunit (α, β, or γ). Removing the γ subunit thumb domain had no effect on Na+ currents when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, but moderately reduced channel surface expression. In contrast, ENaCs lacking the α or β subunit thumb domain exhibited significantly reduced Na+ currents along with a large reduction in channel surface expression. Moreover, channels lacking an α or γ thumb domain exhibited a diminished Na+ self-inhibition response, whereas this response was retained in channels lacking a β thumb domain. In turn, deletion of the α thumb domain had no effect on the degradation rate of the immature α subunit as assessed by cycloheximide chase analysis. However, accelerated degradation of the immature β subunit and mature γ subunit was observed when the β or γ thumb domain was deleted, respectively. Our results suggest that the thumb domains in each ENaC subunit are required for optimal surface expression in oocytes and that the α and γ thumb domains both have important roles in the channel's inhibitory response to external Na+. Our findings support the notion that the extracellular helical domains serve as functional modules that regulate ENaC biogenesis and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2890917028,"APP (amyloid precursor protein), the causative molecule of Alzheimer's disease, is synthesized in neuronal cell bodies and subsequently transported to synapses. We previously showed that the yata gene is required for the synaptic transport of the APP orthologue in Drosophila melanogaster. In this study, we examined the effect of a reduction in yata expression in the Drosophila Alzheimer's disease model, in which expression of human mutant APP was induced. The synaptic localization of APP and other synaptic proteins was differentially inhibited by yata knockdown and null mutation. Expression of APP resulted in abnormal synaptic morphology and the premature death of animals. These phenotypes were partially but significantly rescued by yata knockdown, whereas yata knockdown itself caused no abnormality. Moreover, we observed that synaptic transmission accuracy was impaired in our model, and this phenotype was improved by yata knockdown. Thus, our data suggested that the phenotypes caused by APP can be partially prevented by inhibition of the synaptic localization of a subset of synaptic proteins including APP."

A complete sixth nerve palsy model was achieved via modification of lateral rectus muscle strength. Four different muscle transposition procedures (the Hummelsheim, Jensen, Foster, and muscle union procedures) were set up, and the objective surgical effect of each procedure was calculated using 3D model simulation.In the 3D simulation, sixth nerve palsy was modeled by rotating the eye 34.16 degrees in the medial direction, consistent with 70 prism diopter (PD) esotropia. In surgical model simulation, the Hummelsheim procedure resulted in a 28 PD reduction of total deviation, the Jensen procedure achieved a 34 PD reduction, the Foster procedure led to a 57 PD reduction, the muscle union procedure yielded a 57 PD reduction in esotropia in sixth nerve palsy.The 3D simulation provided a consistent model of sixth nerve palsy and objective data excluding the potential for variation of surgical skill.

The biogenesis of adhesive pili via the chaperone-usher pathway (CUP) is independent of external energy sources. In the classical CUP, chaperones transport assembly-competent pilins in a folded but expanded conformation. During donor-strand exchange, pilins subsequently collapse, producing a tightly packed hydrophobic core and releasing the necessary free energy to drive fiber formation. Here, we show that pilus biogenesis in non-classical, archaic, and alternative CUPs uses a different source of conformational energy. High-resolution structures of the archaic Csu-pili system from Acinetobacter baumannii revealed that non-classical chaperones employ a short donor strand motif that is insufficient to fully complement the pilin fold. This results in chaperone-bound pilins being trapped in a substantially unfolded intermediate. The exchange of this short motif with the longer donor strand from adjacent pilin provides the full steric information essential for folding, and thereby induces a large unfolded-to-folded conformational transition to drive assembly.

The increasing occurrence of antibiotic resistance has accelerated the search for novel therapeutic strategies and the CU pathways are currently being explored as novel drug targets.

Although little sequence homology exists between proteins in classical, alternative and archaic CU pathways, a recent study revealed significant similarities in the structure of the assembly chaperones from the two non-classical pathways (20Pakharukova N.

However, our understanding of non-classical biogenesis is limited and studies are in their infancy compared with the classical CUPs. Acinetobacter baumannii, the most prevalent clinical Acinetobacter species, is a multidrug-resistant, opportunistic and highly persistent Gram-negative bacterium responsible for nosocomial infections (21Boucher H.W.

The Csu pilus comprises four distinct pili subunits, namely the major pilin subunit CsuA/B (16.1 kDa), adaptor subunits CsuA (17.3 kDa) and CsuB (16.9 kDa), and the CsuE tip adhesin (33.5 kDa). Three highly hydrophobic finger-like loops exposed at the N-terminal domain of CsuE are essential for the tight attachment of A. baumannii to various hydrophobic substrates, including the majority of plastics used in medical devices (25Pakharukova N.

A shifted donor strand motif within non-classical chaperones contributes to an altered subunit-binding position (20Pakharukova N. Garnett J.A. Tuittila M. Paavilainen S. Diallo M. Xu Y. Matthews S.J. Zavialov A.V. Structural insight into archaic and alternative chaperone-usher pathways reveals a novel mechanism of pilus biogenesis.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 (26587649)e100526910.1371/journal.ppat.1005269Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Most importantly, non-classical chaperones, unlike their classical counterparts, maintain the subunit in a state with significant conformational disorder (20Pakharukova N. Garnett J.A. Tuittila M. Paavilainen S. Diallo M. Xu Y. Matthews S.J. Zavialov A.V. Structural insight into archaic and alternative chaperone-usher pathways reveals a novel mechanism of pilus biogenesis.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 (26587649)e100526910.1371/journal.ppat.1005269Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consequently, the chaperone-subunit complex does not possess a preformed DSE initiation site, suggesting that the non-classical assembly pathway use an alternative mechanism of fiber assembly. Here, we report the crystal structure of the CsuA/B self-complemented pilin, which completes our atomic resolution understanding of the final fiber-inserted conformation for archaic pilins. A comparison of the structure, dynamics, and thermodynamics of the pilin before and after DSE reveal that the subunit undergoes a dramatic folding transition akin to the conversion of a molten globule to a folded state. We found that non-classical chaperones use much shorter donor strand motifs than the sequence necessary for full complementation of the pilin. Hence, they provide only partial sequence information for the pilin to fold, which preserves substantial folding energy to drive pilus assembly. We also discovered that β sheet ABE of archaic pilins is interrupted in the middle with hairpin insertions. This unique structure undergoes a large conformational change upon DSE, which additionally drives the assembly. Our crystal structure of the CsuC-CsuA/B preassembly complex (PDB code 5D6H) suggested that CsuA/B exhibited significant disorder when in complex with CsuC (20Pakharukova N. Garnett J.A. Tuittila M. Paavilainen S. Diallo M. Xu Y. Matthews S.J. Zavialov A.V. Structural insight into archaic and alternative chaperone-usher pathways reveals a novel mechanism of pilus biogenesis.PLoS Pathog. 2015; 11 (26587649)e100526910.1371/journal.ppat.1005269Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). More than 40% of the CsuA/B sequence had no electron density in electron density maps, which is in sharp contrast to the well-ordered subunits bound to classical chaperones. We therefore decided to examine the importance of this phenomenon in the biogenesis of non-classical systems. We solved two additional crystal structures of the CsuC-CsuA/B preassembly complex in space groups P6522 and H3 (Table S1). The three CsuC molecules are highly similar and superimposable, with r.m.s. deviations on all Cα positions in the range of 0.5–0.6 Å (Fig. 1A). CsuA/B exhibits significantly higher structural heterogeneity (r.m.s. deviations of 1.2–1.3 Å), which is most pronounced in regions distant from CsuC (Fig. 1A, Fig. S2). Although some order is conferred to this segment in the P6522 and especially H3 crystal forms by stabilizing crystal contacts, the majority of this region is either completely disordered or has high thermal motion (B-factors) (Fig. S2). In addition, none of the structures exhibit electron density for the long stretch of sequence between β strands A and A′ in CsuA/B (Fig. 1A, Fig. S2). An NMR backbone resonance assignment of U-15N,13C,2H-labeled CsuC-CsuA/B was performed to characterize the dynamic nature of the archaic preassembly complex in solution (Fig. 1B). The 1H,15N-TROSY spectrum of CsuC-CsuA/B exhibited excellent peak dispersion but significant variations in peaks intensities were apparent, with fewer than expected resonances and some clustering of more intense signals at 8.5 ppm, indicative of native disorder. TROSY-based triple resonance spectra were recorded and facilitated ∼80% backbone assignment for the complex. This assignment covered 68% of CsuC chaperone sequence, in which 158 residues of the possible 233 could be assigned, and 89% of CsuA/B, where 126 residues of 141 were assigned. Many of unassigned amide peaks exhibited poor signal-to-noise in triple resonance experiments, which is likely due to the presence of conformational dynamics on an intermediate timescale. The NMR assignment covers several regions of CsuA/B that are absent from the crystallographic data, affording insight into the structure and dynamics of these regions. NMR chemical shifts are sensitive local probes of structural and dynamics. The experimentally derived chemical shift assignment for the CsuC-CsuA/B complex were analyzed with TALOS-N (28Shen Y. Bax A. Protein backbone and sidechain torsion angles predicted from NMR chemical shifts using artificial neural networks.J. Biomol. NMR. 2013; 56 (23728592): 227-24110.1007/s10858-013-9741-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) to probe the structural propensity of regions absent from the crystallographic data. Residues Gln-19 to Lys-26, spanning the region between the A and A′ β-strands, are considered dynamic along with Ala-48 and Ser-49, which lie upstream of the β-strand. CsuC residues Ile-97 to Asp-106 are also reported as dynamic and these are located within the loop after the G1 strand and are involved in CsuA/B binding. It should be noted that overall TALOS-N predictions of local secondary structure agree with the crystallographic data. Further chemical shift analysis was performed using a disorder-specific neighbor-corrected structural propensity calculator, termed ncSPC (29Tamiola K. Acar B. Mulder F.A. Sequence-specific random coil chemical shifts of intrinsically disordered proteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 (21128621): 18000-1800310.1021/ja105656tCrossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 30Tamiola K. Mulder F.A.

Trans. 2012; 40 (22988857): 1014-102010.1042/BST20120171Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Chemical shift data are compared with a chemical shift library of disordered proteins where deviation from the random coil state indicates structural propensity (29Tamiola K. Acar B. Mulder F.A. Sequence-specific random coil chemical shifts of intrinsically disordered proteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132 (21128621): 18000-1800310.1021/ja105656tCrossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 30Tamiola K. Mulder F.A.

Trans. 2012; 40 (22988857): 1014-102010.1042/BST20120171Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Scores of 1 and −1 reflect fully formed α-helical or β-sheet structure, respectively, whereas a score of less than 1 suggests that that a fraction of the conformers in the ensemble are structured at that position (i.e. 0.5 would 50% helical). Structural propensity reported by ncSPC is consistent with the crystallographic data and TALOS-N analysis (Fig. 1C). In agreement with TALOS-N analysis, the CsuA/B A–A′ region and the loop upstream of the G1 strand in CsuC fall within the range considered disordered. Both regions report slight strand propensity as expected. Taken together this suggests that residues between the A–A′ strands in CsuA/B and the loop upstream of the G1 strand in CsuC exhibit conformational plasticity in complex. Further dynamic information was obtained by measuring backbone 15N-T1 and -T2 relaxation rates and the heteronuclear steady-state 15N-NOE (Fig. 1D). The CsuC chaperone exhibits NOE values consistently distributed around 0.82, the value expected for a rigid structured protein. Residues 99 to 108, in the loop upstream of the G1 strand, exhibit a significant decrease in NOE, indicating enhanced flexibility in this region consistent with the chemical shift analysis. This is observed to a lesser extent for residues 155 to 161, which relate to another loop missing from the original crystal structure. These findings are also in agreement with the 15N-T1 and 15N-T2 values, which are represented here as a T1/T2 plot (Fig. 1D). Deviation from the average value of 42.8 is most pronounced in the pre-G1 loop but is also observed for residues 155 to 161 and 182 to 187. Heteronuclear steady-state 15N-NOE values for CsuA/B exhibit a broader distribution with distinct regions of deviation from 0.8. The most pronounced deviation is observed in the region between the A and A′ strands that was absent in the crystal structure and indicated as disordered by chemical shift analysis. Deviation is observed in other loop regions but most significantly between residues 46 and 55, relating to a loop observed in the crystal structure. The 15N-T1 and 15N-T2 values, represented in a T1/T2 plot, agree with these observations. The average value is 40.4, with the largest deviation again observed in the A to A′ loop and to a lesser extent the loop from residues 46 to 55. Hence, consistent with the crystal structures, these observations highlight enhance flexibility of the chaperone-bound CsuA/B subunit in solution. The authors were able to fully trace the polypeptide chain, but regions of CfaB outside of the subunit-chaperone interface, comprising 31% of the structure, exhibit a high degree of thermal motion (Figs. S2 and S3) and had very poor electron density. Many of these regions are characterized by very low values of real-space correlation coefficient between the model and the density (Fig. S2), suggesting that they contain serious errors resulting from the the poor experimental density. In general, these regions coincide with disordered/flexible regions in chaperone-bound CsuA/B, especially those between β-strands C and E, and E and F (Fig. 2). Both structures also have a poorly ordered region before β-strand B. However, CfaB has a well-ordered sequence that corresponds to the completely disordered region between β-strands A1 and A2 in CsuA/B.

Polymer-coated urea (PCU) fertilizer is a promising controlled release fertilizer that provides improved N-release timing. Glasshouse studies were conducted to compare N2O and NH3 emissions from PCU and uncoated urea to an untreated control utilizing a non-static, non-flow-through chamber in conjunction with photoacoustic infrared spectroscopy (PAIRS) for gas collection and analysis. Three short-term 20-Day Studies with sand, sandy loam, and loam soils and a full-term 45-Day Study with loam soil were completed. Volatilization of NH3 was reduced by 72% and 22% in the sandy loam and loam soils, respectively, in two of the short-term studies and by 14% in the loam in the full-term study. Evolution of N2O was reduced by 42% and 63% in the sandy loam and loam soils of the short-term studies and by 99% in the loam soil of the full-term study. No differences were observed in the sand soil. Overall, PCU decreased gaseous losses of N following fertilization while providing a steady supply of N to the plant. Higher temporal resolution was observed with the PAIRS instrumentation as compared to what is typically reported and, as such, we recommend PAIRS analysis as a viable method for studying N gas emissions."
https://openalex.org/W2891124878,"A new dual-state impedance matching scheme for a microwave driven plasma lamp using a solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) is presented. The impedance of the plasma lamp depends on the amount of input radio frequency (RF) energy, and therefore has very different values for hot and cold states. First, a method for effectively modeling the electrical characteristics of a plasma lamp that depends on RF power has been proposed. Second, a new technique has been proposed to achieve dual-state impedance matching for two state impedances at two very close frequencies using a T-shaped matching network with two section shunt stub and additional transmission line. The proposed method can achieve dual state impedance matching in two frequency bands located very closely when compared to the conventional methods. The accuracy of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the proposed dual-state matching are verified via a plasma lamp system with a 2.45 GHz 300 W GaN SSPA."
