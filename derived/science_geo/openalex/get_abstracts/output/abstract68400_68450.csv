https://openalex.org/W2048962185,"In our opinion, all of the phenomena that are inhibited by cytochalasin can be thought of as resulting from contractile activity of cellular organelles. Smooth muscle contraction, clot retraction, beat of heart cells, and shortening of the tadpole tail are all cases in which no argument of substance for alternative causes can be offered. The morphogenetic processes in epithelia, contractile ring function during cytokinesis, migration of cells on a substratum, and streaming in plant cells can be explained most simply on the basis of contractility being the causal event in each process. The many similarities between the latter cases and the former ones in which contraction is certain argue for that conclusion. For instance, platelets probably contract, possess a microfilament network, and behave like undulating membrane organelles. Migrating cells possess undulating membranes and contain a similar network. It is very likely, therefore, that their network is also contractile."
https://openalex.org/W1584018467,"Abstract The inactivation of xanthine oxidase by cyanide is accompanied by the extraction of sulfur from the protein which is eliminated as thiocyanate. When the cyanide inactivation is carried out under anaerobic conditions, partial reduction of the enzyme occurs, equivalent to approximately a 2-electron uptake per eq of thiocyanate released. Cyanide-inactivated enzyme can be largely reactivated by incubation with Na2S. Experiments with 35S-labeled Na2S reveal that the reactivation is accompanied by the reincorporation of sulfur into the protein. Treatment of such 35S-labeled enzyme with cyanide results in inactivation again and the elimination of 35S-labeled thiocyanate."
https://openalex.org/W1924157033,"The complete amino acid sequence of bovine α-lactalbumin has been established. The unique sequence was deduced by characterization of the tryptic, chymotryptic, and peptic peptides isolated from enzymic hydrolysates of the two unique fragments obtained on cleavage of S-aminoethyl-α-lactalbumin with cyanogen bromide as described earlier. Important overlapping peptides were also obtained by sequence analysis of peptic and chymotryptic peptides isolated from unmodified or S-carboxymethyl-α-lactalbumin. Bovine α-lactalbumin contains 123 residues with NH2-terminal glutamic acid and COOH-terminal leucine. In accord with earlier reports, bovine α-lactalbumin has a considerable similarity in sequence to hen egg-white lysozyme. Alignment of the sequences of these two proteins shows that 49 of the residues are identical and an additional 23 residues are conservative replacements."

https://openalex.org/W1562546535,"Abstract The position specificity of porcine pancreatic α-amylase action on maltotriose (G3) through maltooctaose (G8) has been studied with maltodextrins specifically labeled in the reducing glucose unit with 14C. The initial relative rates of formation of the labeled products were determined for each substrate. As the size of the maltodextrin increases, the point of maximum frequency of attack shifts from the first bond from the reducing end (bond 1) in G3 to bond 2 in G4 through G7 and to bond 3 in G8. All of the dextrins had more than one bond cleaved except G5, which was cleaved only at bond 2 giving labeled G2 (G2*). Further, neither bond 1 nor the nonreducing terminal bond was cleaved for G5 and higher dextrins in the series. The action patterns on G3 and G4 were observed to be concentration-dependent. At low concentrations of G3* (2.5 mm), G1* was formed at a faster rate than G2*; at 44 mm, the rates of formation of G1* and G2* were equal, and at 100 mm the rate of formation of G2* exceeded G1*. By kinetic analysis and specific labeling experiments, it has been shown that, at low concentrations of G3 the formation of products is due to hydrolysis. At high concentrations, the products are due to a condensation reaction in which 2 molecules of G3 condense to give G6 with subsequent hydrolysis and change in product distribution. The data are consistent with a five-glucose binding site, in which the catalytic groups are located at bond 2."
https://openalex.org/W2016318300,"The activity of galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase was extremely low in serum, leukocytes, and cultured fibroblasts of patients with Krabbe's disease. Antemortem diagnosis is possible without organ biopsies. The parents of patients showed enzyme activities generally lower than that of normal controls. This finding provides supportive evidence that the deficient activity of galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase is the genetically determined enzymatic defect underlying the disease. Demonstration of this deficiency requires the use of the specific substrate, galactocerebroside. Assays carried out with synthetic, unnatural substrates, such as 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-galactoside, do not distinguish patients or heterozygous carriers from normal individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2086642325,"Excessive induction of δ-aminolevulinic acid synthetase in rats after treatment with porphyria-inducing chemicals, such as allylisopropylacetamide, is accompanied by a decrease in microsomal heme and cytochrome P450 concentrations. Measurement of the radioactive decay after labeling of the heme moiety of submicrosomal particles shows increased breakdown of heme in rats treated with allylisopropylacetamide. The effects of allylisopropylacetamide on heme synthesis and heme turnover may be interrelated."
https://openalex.org/W1498797325,"The four disulfide bonds formed by the 8 half-cystinyl residues in α-lactalbumin have been established by sequence analysis of peptides isolated from enzymic digests. Two unique disulfide-containing peptides were isolated by chromatography from peptic digests of α-lactalbumin. A third peptic peptide contained 4 half-cystinyl residues. Further degradation of this peptide with thermolysin gave two additional, unique disulfide-containing peptides that were readily separated by column chromatography. Partial sequence analysis of each of the four unique disulfide peptides after reduction and carboxymethylation provided an unequivocal assignment of the four disulfide bonds in α-lactalbumin. The four disulfide bonds are formed through linkages between Residues 6 and 120, Residues 28 and 111, Residues 61 and 77, and Residues 73 and 91. This arrangement of the disulfide bonds is essentially identical with that found in chicken egg-white lysozyme."

https://openalex.org/W2255671757,Abstract Acid hydrolysis of flavin peptides from the active center of mammalian succinate dehydrogenase yields a substituted riboflavin which was isolated in pure form. It contains a substituent attached to position 8α of riboflavin. Drastic acid hydrolysis of this compound and catalytic hydrogenation yield nearly 1 mole of free histidine. Histidine is also liberated on neutral photolysis. The presence of histidine is confirmed by behavior on high voltage electrophoresis at various pH values and by acid titration curves. Linkage of the 8α-CH3 group of riboflavin is to one of the imidazole ring nitrogens since neither the flavin peptide nor its acid derivative give a Pauly reaction. This assignment is in full accord with the characteristic pH-fluorescence curve of covalently bound flavin. The pK of the fluorescence quenching agrees with that expected for the imidazole nitrogen in histidyl flavin.
https://openalex.org/W2086344452,"The effects of tissue explants and nerve homogenates on cholinesterase activity of muscle of the newt Triturus in organ culture were measured. Sensory ganglia, ganglia separated from muscle by a Millipore filter, spinal cord, liver, and nerve homogenates produced greater activity of muscle cholinesterase than occurred in untreated muscle cultured for the same period of time. Boiled ganglia, kidney, oviduct, and spleen were ineffective. This procedure serves as a convenient bioassay for a neurotrophic process and indicates that the trophic effect is mediated by a diffusible chemical substance produced by nerves."
https://openalex.org/W1579494157,"Abstract Bovine lactoferrin has a molecular weight of 77,100 ± 1500 in dilute aqueous solution as determined by the method of sedimentation equilibrium in the ultracentrifuge. In 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in the presence or absence of mercaptoethanol, bovine lactoferrin has a molecular weight of 72,500 to 77,200 ±1300 as measured by sedimentation equilibrium in the ultracentrifuge or by gel filtration on agarose columns. The molecular weight obtained by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate is 76,000 ± 2400. Tryptic peptide maps reveal a number of peptides approximately equal to the content of lysine plus arginine in the molecule. Quantitative end group analysis shows 1 residue of alanine at the amino terminus of the molecule. These data demonstrate that bovine lactoferrin is composed of a single polypeptide chain. Analysis of the carbohydrate content revealed 1 residue of terminal sialic acid, 10 to 11 residues of N-acetyl glucosamine, 5 to 6 residues of galactose, and 15 to 16 residues of mannose per molecule of lactoferrin. Another protein, isolated as a major contaminant in commercial preparations of bovine α-lactalbumin showed identical properties to bovine lactoferrin except that it appeared, based upon molecular weight measurements, to be an aggregating system."
https://openalex.org/W1525992734,"Heavy water has been used as a tool to study the role of water in the association-dissociation equilibrium of subunit proteins. In the case of lactate dehydrogenase, D2O was found to stabilize the enzyme at low ionic strength and inhibit subunit interchange between heart- and muscle-type enzyme in solution. When frozen, however, subunit interchange occurred to a similar extent in either D2O or H2O. In the case of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase, D2O appears to facilitate the association of monomers to form polymers. The maximum weight average molecular weights of glutamate dehydrogenase were found to be approximately doubled in D2O compared with H2O, and the dissociation constant of the polymer appeared to be much smaller in D2O. The weight average molecular weights were calculated from sedimentation velocity and diffusion rate measurements in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Because these measurements were made at 8°, at which the contribution of hydrophobic bonding would be minimal, it was concluded that the stabilizing action of D2O reflected the increased strength of deuterium bonds and deuterium water bridges. Alteration of the association-dissociation equilibrium in regulatory proteins by D2O is a possible mechanism to explain certain of the potent inhibitory effects of D2O on biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W1484478144,"Abstract Reaction of S-aminoethyl-α-lactalbumin with cyanogen bromide results in the cleavage of the one methionyl peptide bond in the molecule to give two unique polypeptide fragments. One fragment contains the first 90 residues from the NH2-terminus of α-lactalbumin and the other contains the remaining 33 residues in the molecule including the COOH-terminus. The tryptic, chymotryptic, and peptic peptides from these fragments, or from S-carboxymethyl-α-lactalbumin, have been purified by ion exchange chromatography and gel filtration. These peptides represent the necessary overlaps in sequence that are required to deduce the complete amino acid sequence of α-lactalbumin."
https://openalex.org/W1480124032,"Abstract The denaturation of sperm whale myoglobin, horse heart cytochrome c, and bovine α-chymotrypsinogen by various water-miscible amides has been investigated by spectral, difference spectral, and optical rotatory dispersion methods. As in the case of denaturants of the type of alcohols, glycols, and ureas, the effectiveness of the amides was found to increase with increasing hydrocarbon content and alkyl substitution of their functional amino groups. Branching of the hydrocarbon portion of the substituent groups of the latter compounds decreased their effectiveness as protein denaturants. Analysis of the denaturation data based on the theories of Peller and Flory, with appropriate binding constants and Setschenow parameters calculated from the solubilities of N-acetyl-l-tryptophan ethyl ester, has shown that hydrophobic interactions play an increasingly important role with increasing hydrocarbon content in the mode of action of the amides as denaturants."

https://openalex.org/W1612420661,"The methylation of major nuclear DNA-cytosine was found to occur throughout the mitotic cycle of Physarum polycephalum, during the period of DNA synthesis (S), as well as during the remainder of interphase (G2) when essentially no synthesis de novo of the major nuclear DNA takes place. After incubation of the mold with methionine methyl-3H, 5-methylcytosine was the only radioactive methylated minor base detected in major nuclear DNA, although 3H was also found to be incorporated during the S period into DNA-adenine, -guanine, and -thymine, presumably by conversion of the methionine methyl group to 1-carbon intermediates incorporated into DNA nucleotides during synthesis de novo. During the G2 period, methylation of major nuclear DNA occurred at a relatively constant rate which was approximately 50% of that observed during the S period. Incorporation of 3H from methionine methyl-3H into 5-methylcytosine of both mitochondrial DNA and the nuclear heavy satellite DNA was also observed. It was estimated that the three DNA fractions of Physarum contain 1 methylcytosine residue for every 12 to 24 cytosine residues."

The oxidized protein was diamagnetic in the entire temperature range, and the reduced protein exhibited a paramagnetism without any deviation from Curie's law (S = 1/2).

https://openalex.org/W2026545891,"The histochemical reaction for phosphorylase is completely lost from anterior horn neurons rich in phosphorylase within 72 hours after proximal or distal axonal section. Using this new type of axonal reaction as a marking technique in the anterior horn of the seventh lumbar spinal cord segment of the cat, we demonstrated that (i) alpha motor neurons of slow twitch motor units, like those of fast twitch motor units, are rich in phosphorylase and poor in succinate dehydrogenase, and (ii) interneurons and Renshaw neurons are rich in succinate dehydrogenase and poor in phosphorylase. Gamma motor neurons, because of their small size, are considered to be rich in succinate dehydrogenase and poor in phosphorylase. Thus, anterior horn neurons capable of higher firing frequencies (Renshaw neurons, interneurons, and gamma motor neurons) are richer in mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activity as marked by succinate dehydrogenase. Those firing at lower frequencies (both types of alpha motor neurons) are richer in phosphorylase activity and glycogen content and, thus, apparently better equipped for anaerobic glycolysis."
https://openalex.org/W2064524171,"Slices of cerebral cortex from the adult rat were incubated with and without hydrocortisone succinate, and their subsequent uptake of isotopically labeled norepinephrine was measured. Preincubation with hydrocortisone resulted in a statistically significant increase in the amount of exogenous norepinephrine taken up by the slices. Preincubation with corresponding concentrations of sodium succinate was without effect. The principal effect of the hydrocortisone-mediated increase in norepinephrine concentration is apparently on an active transport mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W1622489867,"1-14C-1-3H-Hexadecanol was incubated with Ehrlich ascites cells grown in tissue culture for 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. The distribution of radioactivity, specific radioactivities, and 3H:14C ratios of the acyl, alkyl, and alk-1-enyl moieties derived from glyceryl ether diesters, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines were determined and compared. All of the labeled alcohol disappeared within 12 hours and 65 to 85% of the administered radioactivity was incorporated into the lipids of the cell. The radioactivity was selectively incorporated into the glyceryl ethers of glyceryl ether diesters, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine. The percentage of radioactivity in the alkyl glyceryl ethers of the phosphatidylethanolamine decreased with increased incubation time, and the alk-1-enyl glyceryl ethers showed a corresponding increase in the percentage of radioactivity. Total and specific radioactivities strongly suggest a product-precursor relationship between the alkyl and alk-1-enyl glyceryl ethers, as our earlier data suggested. The alk-1-enyl acyl phosphoglyceride (plasmalogen) appears to arise by dehydrogenation of the intact alkyl acyl phosphoglycerides. The data also indicate that the origin of acyl and alkyl moieties of phosphatidylcholine is different from the origin of these moieties used in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylethanolamine. An unidentified radioactive lipid fraction, containing possible intermediates of alkyl glyceryl ether biosynthesis, was isolated from the media and partially characterized."
https://openalex.org/W1502933868,"Hydrogen exchange rates of bovine plasma albumin vary over the range of pH 5 to 8.5. As the pH is raised, the number of very slowly exchanging hydrogens decreases and the number of rapidly exchanging hydrogens steadily increases. The rate of exchange of hydrogens of the very slowly exchanging core at pH 5 was studied at pH values from pH 5.2 to pH 8.5. The results obtained suggest that this protein is highly motile; that is, it fluctuates rapidly at pH 7 and above between states in which exchangeable hydrogens are accessible to bulk solvent and ones in which they are not accessible. In the range of pH 5 to 6.5, no segments of the core appear to be highly motile but compact segments may become highly motile as the pH is raised through this range. The alternative possibility, that changes in exchange behavior at pH 5.2 to 6.5 are the results of changes of the local environment of individual exchanging groups, cannot be excluded. The effects of sodium dodecyl sulfate, glycerol, and changing ionic strength were also studied at pH 5 and 7.7. The results were consistent with three possible explanations: (a) that these agents stabilize compact conformational states of segments of bovine plasma albumin; (b) that they reduce segmental conformational motility;; or (c) that they alter the local environment of individual exchanging groups and thus influence the rate dependencies of exchange of these units. Discrimination between these three mechanisms was not deemed possible on the basis of our experimental data."
https://openalex.org/W2020576262,"Neurosecretory cells in the supraoptic nuclei of anesthetized cats were antidromically identified by electrical stimulation of the posterior pituitary. The responses of these units to afferent volleys from vagal and carotid sinus nerves were examined with a computer of average transients. Synaptic excitation of neurosecretory cells by stimulation of these pathways demonstrates the existence of excitatory inputs from vagal and carotid sinus nerve afferents. Since these pathways are involved in the release of antidiuretic hormone, the results support the hypothesis that its release is related to an increase in discharge frequency of supraoptic neurosecretory cells."

The postnatal development of the transferase is accelerated in hyperbilirubinemic heterozygotes.
https://openalex.org/W1485861990,"Abstract The circular dichroism spectrum of bovine growth hormone in the wave length region 250 to 300 nm shows five peaks at 290.5, 284.5, 270, 264, and 258 nm. The longest wave length maximum at 290.5 is assigned to the 1 tryptophanyl residue. The two bands centered at 264 and 258 agree in wave length maxima with the circular dichroism bands of phenylalanyl model compounds. The two remaining peaks, although of opposite sign, are assigned in major part to tyrosyl residues. pH changes in aqueous solution have selective effects on the tryptophanyl and tyrosyl bands, whereas urea modifies them similarly. The phenylalanyl bands survive both extremes of pH and concentrated urea solutions. About half the peptide groups in bovine growth hormone participate in helical structures. In contrast to the important effects that acid and alkali have on the optical activity of the tryptophanyl and tyrosyl chromophores, the peptide dichroic activity is only slightly influenced. Most of the helical residues are, however, randomized in concentrated urea solution."

The primary structure of the constant region has been adduced by partial sequence analysis of the tryptic peptides, from the composition of the chymotryptic peptides, and by homology to other human λ chains. Twenty-three tryptic peptides covering the entire protein and 32 chymotryptic peptides covering all but 8 of the total of 216 residues were isolated. The position of 148 residues was determined directly by Edman degradation and enzymatic digestion or by the overlapping of peptides. The remainder were placed by homology. Compared to the reference λ chain Sh, Protein Bo has additional residues at four new positions (the NH2 terminus and positions 27a, 27b, and 27c) and lacks a residue at position 96 (des-96). Residues 109 through 213 appear identical with the sequence reported for Protein Sh and four other λ chains that have been sequenced, but from 30 to 50 residues differ in the first or variable half of λ chains. The calculated molecular weight of the monomeric form of Protein Bo is 22,982."
https://openalex.org/W1502974938,"Abstract The primary structure of the variable region of the human λ Bence-Jones Protein Ha has been determined by sequence analysis of the tryptic and chymotryptic peptides; the primary structure of the constant region has been deduced by partial sequence analysis of these peptides and by homology. Twenty-nine chymotryptic peptides covering all but eight of the total of 217 residues were isolated from the carboxymethylated protein. The complete sequence was determined for 14 chymotryptic peptides; of these, nine are in the variable region and five are in the constant region. For the remaining peptides only the partial sequence or the amino acid composition and the end groups were obtained. These results permitted the ordering of all of the tryptic peptides. Of the 15 chymotryptic peptides from the variable region, only a tripeptide was identical with any previously reported for human λ chains. Most of the chymotryptic peptides of the constant region appeared identical with those previously reported for the human λ chain, Protein Sh. No evidence was obtained for variation in sequence of the last 105 residues, but the variable region differed in from 29 to 54 residues from others previously reported."
