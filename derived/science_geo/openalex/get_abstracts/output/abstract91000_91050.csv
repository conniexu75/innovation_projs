https://openalex.org/W2088039859,"Benzoyl peroxide, a widely used free radical-generating compound, promoted both papillomas and carcinomas when it was topically applied to mice after 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene initiation. Benzoyl peroxide was inactive on the skin as a complete carcinogen or as a tumor initiator. A single topical application of benzoyl peroxide produced a marked epidermal hyperplasia and induced a large number of dark basal keratinocytes, effects similar to those produced by the potent tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate. Benzoyl peroxide, like other known tumor promoters, also inhibited metabolic cooperation (intercellular communication) in Chinese hamster cells. In view of these results caution should be recommended in the use of this and other free radical-generating compounds."
https://openalex.org/W2057141478,"Abstract The immune response in BALB/c mice to phosphorylcholine is highly restricted in its heterogeneity. Of the 19 immunoglobulins binding phosphorylcholine for which complete V H -segment amino acid sequences have been determined, 10 employ a single sequence, denoted T15 after the prototype V H sequence of this group of antibodies. The remaining 9 of these V H segments are variants differing by 1 to 8 residues from the T15 sequence. Using a cloned V H cDNA probe complementary to the T15 sequence, we isolated from a mouse sperm genomic library clones corresponding to four V H gene segments that by DNA sequence analysis are >85% homologous to one another. These four V H gene segments have been denoted the T15 V H gene family. These V H gene segments are most, if not all, of the germline V H gene segments that could encode the V H sequences of antibodies that bind phosphorylcholine. One of these four genes contains the T15-V H -coding sequence. When the T15-family V H gene segments were compared with the complete V H protein sequences of 19 hybridoma and myeloma immunoglobulins that bind phosphorylcholine, several striking conclusions could be drawn. First, all of these V H regions must have arisen from the germline T15 V H gene segment. Thus virtually the entire immune response to phosphorylcholine is derived from a single V H -coding sequence. Nine of the 19 V H regions were variants differing from the T15-V H -coding sequence and, accordingly, must have arisen by a mechanism of somatic diversification. Second, the variants appear to be generated by a somatic mutation mechanism. They cannot be explained by recombination or gene conversion among members of the T15 gene family. Third, somatic mutation is correlated with the class of the antibody. All of the somatic variation is found in the V H regions derived from antibodies of the IgA and IgG classes. The IgM molecules express the germline T15 V H gene segment exclusively."

https://openalex.org/W2010381093,"Abstract Immunofluorescent labeling for fibronectin was largely excluded from sites of closest contact between spreading chicken gizzard fibroblasts and the substratum. This was observed by double immunofluorescent labeling of fixed cells for fibronectin and vinculin, a smooth muscle intracellular protein that is specifically associated with focal adhesion plaques, in conjunction with interference-reflection microscopy. When the cells were plated on a fibronectin-coated substratum they adhered to its surface and rapidly spread on it. The immunofluorescent labeling for fibronectin in those cultures (after fixation and triton permeabilization) was usually absent from the newly formed, vinculin-containing focal adhesion plaques. We have found, however, that the accessibility to the cell-substrate gap at the focal adhesion plaques is limited and therefore a more direct approach was adopted. We have found that cells spreading on a substrate coated with rhodamine-labeled fibronectin progressively removed the underlying protein from the substrate. The removal of fibronectin involved at least two distinct mechanisms. Part of the substrate-associated fibronectin was removed from small areas and displaced toward the cell center. The arrowhead-shaped areas from which fibronectin was removed often coincided with vinculin-rich focal contacts. We observed, however, many areas where focal contacts were found over unperturbed fibronectin carpet, as well as fibronectin-free areas with no overlapping focal contacts. The possibilities that fibronectin is actively displaced from areas of cell-substrate contact, that the focal adhesion plaques are transiently associated with these areas and their implications on the dynamics of cell spreading and locomotion are discussed. The second route of fibronectin removal from the substrate was endocytosis. The rhodamine-labeled fibronectin was found in the cells in a partial or transient association with clathrin-containing structures."
https://openalex.org/W2069490422,"A single germline immunoglobulin kappa-variable-region gene, VK167, is rearranged and expressed in two myelomas, MOPC167 and MOPC511. Only this single germline gene displays close homology to the expressed genes. Neither of the rearranged, functional genes, however, has a nucleotide sequence that is identical to the germline VK167 gene. Both active genes display several single-base-pair mutations with respect to the germline sequence. The nucleotide sequence data predict the alteration of a restriction-enzyme-recognition site within the VK167 gene between germline cells and cells producing the MOPC167 light-chain protein. Based on this restriction-site alteration, Southern blot analysis proves unambiguously that no gene present in the germline BALB/c mouse genome contains the exact VK167 nucleotide sequence found in cells committed to MOPC167 antibody production. Instead the alterations found in the expressed MOPC167 and MOPC511 V-region genes have apparently arisen by a process of somatic mutation during cellular differentiation. Since nucleotide alterations are found in framework and hypervariable portions of the variable region, the mechanism of somatic mutation is not limited to hypervariable sequences. In addition, Southern blot hybridization indicates that the observed mutations did not arise by recombinational events, but are single-base-pair substitutions. Based on the distribution of mutations that have been found in expressed immunoglobulin variable-region genes, a model that links the introduction of somatic mutations to DNA replication during the V-J joining event is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W2406629693,"Tissue factor (tissue thromboplastin, factor III), an initiator of coagulation, has been purified 142,000-fold to homogeneity from bovine brain. The protein is an integral membrane glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 43,000 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The apoprotein was first purified by extraction with Triton X-100 and repeated preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Antiserum was produced against a few micrograms of purified apoprotein and was used to construct an immunoadsorbent column. The column was then used for affinity purification of the apoprotein directly from the Triton X-100 extract, thereby significantly increasing the amount of purified protein produced. The purification scheme may be generally useful for the rapid and large scale purification of membrane proteins. Tryptic digestion of the apoprotein in Triton X-100 cleaved a peptide of approximately 3000 daltons without affecting the activity. The activity was recovered directly from stained SDS polyacrylamide gels, and the profile of recovered activity corresponded directly with the stained bands. The activity shifted along with the protein band following tryptic digestion, thus demonstrating that the protein observed on the gels is tissue factor. The coagulant activity of the purified apoprotein was reconstituted by the addition of phospholipid. Optimal activity was observed at phospholipid to protein ratios (w/w) greater than 450:1."
https://openalex.org/W1544514004,"Homogenates of isolated pancreatic islets contain 40-70 times as much flavin-linked glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.99.5) as homogenates of whole pancreas, liver, heart, or skeletal muscle when the activity is assayed with either iodonitrotetrazolium or with dichloroindophenol as an electron acceptor. Intact mitochondria from islets release 3HOH from [2-3H]glycerol phosphate 7 times faster than do skeletal muscle mitochondria. The activity of the cytosolic, NAD-linked, glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.8) in pancreatic islets is comparable to that of the mitochondrial dehydrogenase so a glycerol phosphate shuttle is possible in pancreatic islets. Diazoxide, an inhibitor of insulin release in vivo and in vitro, inhibits the islet mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase in all three of the assays mentioned above at concentrations that inhibit insulin release and CO2 formation from glucose by isolated pancreatic islets. Diazoxide does not inhibit the dehydrogenase in mitochondria from skeletal muscle, liver, and heart. A slight inhibition in mitochondria from whole pancreas can be accounted for as inhibition of the islet dehydrogenase because no inhibition is observed in mitochondria from pancreas of rats treated with alloxan, an agent that causes diabetes by destroying pancreatic beta cells. The results of this study are compatible with the hypothesis that the mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase has a key role in stimulus-secretion coupling in the pancreatic beta cell during glucose-induced insulin release."

https://openalex.org/W1590345945,"Villin, one of the calcium regulated modulator proteins of F-actin organization, restricts F-actin to short filaments in the presence of calcium and bundles F-actin in the absence of calcium. Limited in vitro proteolysis of villin generates, in addition to a large core fragment (apparent Mr = 90,000) previously described, a small headpiece (Mr = 8,500). The finding that the F-actin nucleation and severing activity of villin, but not its bundling activity, is retained by the core suggested that the headpiece may be directly involved in bundling. Headpiece has now been purified and characterized. It shows strong F-actin binding both in the presence and absence of calcium, leading to a final stoichiometry of 1 headpiece to 1 F-actin monomer. Headpiece also inhibits villin-induced F-actin bundling. Thus villin expresses at least two distinct actin-binding sites localized on separate functional domains. Protein sequence analysis documents that the core comprises the NH2-terminal portion of intact villin, whereas the headpiece covers the COOH-terminal 76 amino acids. We provide the amino acid sequence of the headpiece, which is currently the smallest F-actin binding peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1527689914,"The fatty acid composition of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidic acid (PA), and the free fatty acid pool of human platelets was studied as a function of time following thrombin stimulation. Upon addition of thrombin, the total amount of fatty acids in decreased sharply, then rose toward basal levels, while that of PA showed an inverse pattern. However, the percentage distribution of fatty acids in stimulated as well as unstimulated and those in stimulated PA remained relatively constant: stearic and arachidonic acids accounted for 90 and 80% of the total in and PA, respectively. These data suggest that in stimulated human platelets and PA are interconverted via the PI cycle. The time course of changes in and PA may suggest that the levels of arachidonyl-stearyl PA are involved in regulation of the resynthesis of arachidonyl-steryl PI. In contrast to and PA, the free fatty acid pool showed sharp increases in the five major platelet fatty acids: arachidonate, stearate, palmitate, oleate, as well as linoleate. These data suggest that most of the fatty acids liberated upon platelet stimulation are not derived via metabolism but by other mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W153761701,"Diacylglycerol lipase activity has been demonstrated in human fetal membranes and decidua vera tissues. The specific activity of the enzyme is highest in the microsomal fraction of decidua vera tissue. The acylester bond at the sn-1 position of 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol is hydrolyzed followed by release of the fatty acid at the sn-2 position. The diacylglycerol lipase activity present in the microsomal fraction of decidua vera tissue hydrolyzes preferentially a diacylglycerol containing an arachidonoyl group in the sn-2 position. Monoacylglycerol lipase activity was also demonstrated in these tissues. The specific activity of monoacylglycerol lipase was significantly greater than that of diacylglycerol lipase and catalyzed preferentially the hydrolysis of monoacylglycerols containing an arachidonyl group in the sn-2 position. Based on the subcellular distribution and the differential effects of various inhibitors, we suggest that the monoacylglycerol lipase and diacylglycerol lipase in decidua vera tissue are 2 distinct enzymes. Diacylglycerol kinase specific activity was examined also and was found to be 4-5 times greater in amnion than in either chorion laeve or decidua vera. The importance of diacylglycerol metabolism in the mechanism of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin biosynthesis is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2068331446,"Spontaneous diabetes occurring in ""BB"" rats (derived from a colony of outbred Wistar rats) is the result of destruction of pancreatic islets by infiltrating mononuclear cells (insulitis) and may be a disease very similar to human juvenile onset diabetes. Both diseases probably have an autoimmune etiology. Evidence is presented that islets transplanted to diabetic BB rats are destroyed by the original disease process. Inoculation of bone marrow from normal (nondiabetes-susceptible) rat donors into neonatal BB recipients usually prevented the development of hyperglycemia."
https://openalex.org/W2019352751,"The antibody produced by the hybrid cell line DK.1A4 recognizes an antigen present initially on all the epithelial cells of the D. melanogaster wing imaginal disc. This antigen becomes progessively restricted to cells in the dorsal region of the disc during the final larval instar. The presence of the antigen does not correlate with the specific adult structures to which the cells will eventually contribute, but rather with the position of the cells in the disc. In late discs, the line bounding the region in which the antigen persists corresponds to the boundary between the dorsal and ventral compartments as revealed by a clonal analysis of the undifferentiated disc. Together, these data suggest that the antigen's disappearance may be specific to the cells of the ventral compartment of the wing disc."

https://openalex.org/W1531070101,"Human renal renin was purified from normal kidney by either of two protocols which combined sequential DEAE-cellulose chromatography, pepstatin affinity chromatography, gel filtration, and a final step of affinity chromatography using either the synthetic octapeptide renin inhibitor (D-Leu6] or antirenin immunoglobulin as ligand. An approximate 500,000-fold purification and a yield of 1 mg of protein or 7% enzymatic activity from 10 kg were obtained by either method. Maximum specific activity was 1170 Goldblatt units/mg. Amino acid composition and kinetic properties were determined. Using purified angiotensinogen substrate, optimum pH was 5.5-6.0 and the Km was 1.54 X 10(-6) M. Two major forms of renin possessing similar enzymatic and immunologic properties, but differing in apparent molecular size and charge were purified and characterized. One form, the major form obtained after antibody affinity chromatography, had an apparent molecular size of 50 kilodaltons by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis and migrated more slowly (RF = 0.32) on polyacrylamide disc gel electrophoresis at pH 7.8. The other form had an apparent molecular size of 39 kilodaltons and migrated more rapidly (RF = 0.76) on polyacrylamide disc gels. This smaller form predominated in protocols which allowed the persistent presence of acid protease activity throughout purification. Moreover, renin molecular size was demonstrated to change from 50 to 40 kilodaltons in the presence of this protease, which was subsequently isolated from the penultimate step of renin purification and tentatively identified as a renal cathepsin D. These findings help reconcile certain disparate characteristics for pure human renin obtained by others, explain the marked instability of the human enzyme, and suggest that the apparent molecular size of human renin is somewhat larger than had been previously reported."
https://openalex.org/W1552709225,"A protein kinase (designated PC0.7 in DePaoli-Roach, A. A., Roach, P. J., and Larner, J. (1979) J. Biol. Chem. 254, 12062-12068) that phosphorylated both glycogen synthase and phosvitin, has been extensively purified from rabbit skeletal muscle, close to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme activity was associated with two polypeptides, alpha (Mr = 43,000) and beta (Mr = 25,000), present in approximately equimolar amounts. The apparent molecular weight of the enzyme was 180,000, as determined by gel filtration, and 130,000, as judged from sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Unless precautions were taken during the purification, the alpha polypeptide underwent degradation, probably as a result of protease action. The beta polypeptide itself could be phosphorylated upon incubation of the enzyme with ATP and Mg2+ but no significant change in activity accompanied this phosphorylation reaction. The protein kinase was effective in utilizing both ATP and GTP as phosphate donors, with apparent Km values of 13 microM and 20-35 microM, respectively. The apparent Km values for phosvitin and glycogen synthase were 15 microM and greater than 10 microM, respectively. PC0.7 phosphorylated glycogen synthase to a level of approximately 0.5 phosphate/subunit, with little inactivation of the glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation occurred predominantly in a 21,000-dalton cyanogen bromide fragment of glycogen synthase, the same fragment preferentially phosphorylated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. This phosphorylation was also located in an approximately 17,000-dalton COOH-terminal region of the glycogen synthase molecule that is removed by limited tryptic proteolysis. Phosphorylation of glycogen synthase by PC0.7 occurred at serine residues whereas in phosvitin both serine and threonine residues were modified by PC0.7 action."
https://openalex.org/W1816186126,"Vasopressin, phenylephrine, and A23187 cause an accumulation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in hepatocytes from fed rats, but not in Ca2+-depleted hepatocytes from fed rats or in phosphorylase kinase-deficient hepatocytes from (gsd/gsd) rats. The effect of vasopressin and phenylephrine is not found in hepatocytes from overnight-starved rats. Thus, the accumulation of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate by these agents may depend on the stimulation of glycogenolysis and on the resulting accumulation of hexose 6-phosphate. In support of this hypothesis, conditions are described for the enzymatic synthesis of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate from fructose 6-phosphate and Mg-ATP in liver extracts. Half-maximal activity (0.8 nmol/min.g) is obtained with about 60 microM fructose 6-phosphate, and the activity can be separated fom phosphofructokinase by ammonium sulfate fractionation. Treatment of rats or isolated hepatocytes with glucagon results in a 4-5-fold decrease in the maximal activity of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1593356311,"An inhibitor of human C1q has been purified from serum and identified as a chondroitin 4-sulfate proteoglycan. A typical preparation contained 22% uronic acid, 20% hexosamine, 12% sulfate, and 9% protein. When chromatographed on Sepharose CL-2B, the proteoglycan was eluted as a broad peak with a mean Kav of 0.6, which indicates that it is polydisperse and has an average Mr = approximately 175,000 (range, 45,000-750,000). Unlike the major species of cartilage proteoglycans, the serum proteoglycan did not form a complex with hyaluronic acid. Additional evidence for the noncartilaginous origin of C1q inhibitor is that its glycosaminoglycan chains totally lack chondroitin 6-sulfate isomers. Furthermore, the glycosaminoglycan component of C1q inhibitor was eluted from Sepharose CL-6B with a Kav of 0.52, indicating that these polysaccharide chains are considerably larger than those of human articular cartilage proteoglycan. The interaction between the proteoglycan and C1q was clearly evident in 0.15 M NaCl, as demonstrated by a radial immunodiffusion technique. The interaction decreased with increasing ionic strength but was not entirely abolished even at 0.3 M NaCl. These findings suggest that the interaction between C1q and the C1q inhibitor may occur under physiological conditions and may be of importance in modulating C1q activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W1617060443,"Purified, apoprostaglandin synthetase was prepared from sheep vesicular gland and studied in terms of its heme-binding properties. The enzyme binds a single heme group per enzyme monomer, Mr = 70,000. When reconstituted with heme, the enzyme has an absorption maximum at 412 nm and an absorption coefficient, epsilon 412 nm, of 120 mM-1 cm-1. The binding of heme to the apoenzyme was accompanied by a proportional increase in enzyme activity up to the point of heme-binding saturation. This reconstituted holoenzyme forms prostaglandin H2 from arachidonate. We conclude that prostaglandin synthetase possesses the heme-binding properties of a typical heme protein and that a single heme group mediates both the oxygenase and the peroxidase activities of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1483012534,"Three major forms of cytosolic glutathione S-transferase (designated F1, F2, and F3 transferases according to increasing isoelectric points) were purified to homogeneity from liver of DBA/2J mice, primarily by CM-cellulose and hydroxylapatite chromatography. The purified enzymes were shown to have specific activities of 104, 281, and 143 units/mg, respectively, when assayed with 1 mM each of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene and reduced glutathione. Antisera against these three forms of mouse transferase were raised separately in rabbits. F1 and F2 transferases showed complete immunological identity either by double immunodiffusion or enzyme immunoinactivation tests. No cross-reactivity was observed between the antisera to F1 (or F2) transferase an F3 transferase or between the antisera to F3 transferase and F1 (or F2) transferase. F1 and F2 transferases were shown to be homodimers with an identical molecular weight of 44,000 +/- 1,000, whereas F3 transferase has a dimeric molecular weight of 51,000 +/- 2,000. The amino acid composition and tryptic peptide map of F1 transferase are similar to those of F2 transferase, but are distinct from those of F3 transferase. In addition to these major forms, a minor form of mouse transferase (F4) with a high isoelectric point (greater than 9.5) was shown to be a mixture of interconvertible isomers of F2 and F3 transferase. Different forms of mouse transferase were studied extensively with respect to their biochemical properties, including Michaelis constants, substrate specificity, thermal stability, and fluorometric ligand binding. The results of this study suggest great species variations regarding the multiple forms as well as the substrate specificity of this family of enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1524542146,"We find that the two wide-range Na+-dependent transport systems A and ASC for various neutral amino acid can be discriminated more sharply in the hepatoma cell line HTC than in any cell yet studied by us in which the two systems co-exist. The gain comes partly from a higher reproducibility and a higher relative ASC rate for HTC than in ordinary rat hepatocytes, also a repressed condition of System A unless first deprived of amino acids, but mainly from our finding that in the hepatoma cell threonine serves as a nearly specific substrate and inhibitor of System ASC, thus decisively supplementing older discriminatory techniques. In ordinary hepatocytes cysteine is quite specific to ASC as a substrate but not as an inhibitor, whereas threonine is specific in neither role. In the hepatoma cell cysteine in turn is specific in neither role. In addition to these and other differences between the two cells in analog specificity, which are partly assignable to System ASC and partly to System A, System ASC of the hepatoma cell shows an inhibition on lowering the pH from 6.5 to 5 not seen in the ordinary hepatocyte. Furthermore, threonine uptake by the hepatoma cell undergoes no stimulation when Li+ is substituted for choline in a Na+-free medium, whereas ASC uptake by the ordinary rat hepatocyte is stimulated much as is System A uptake. As in other occurrences, and in contrast to System A, ASC transport in the hepatoma cell is stimulated neither by amino acid deprivation nor by insulin, glucagon, or dexamethasone. Trans-stimulation, both inward and outward, via System ASC is vigorous in the hepatoma cell. Despite the surprising differences observed, common features of each system in various occurrences continue to justify the use of the abbreviations ASC and A as long as they are understood as generic designations."

This peptide remains associated with vesicles when steapsin protease digests of vesicle-incorporated reductase were fractionated by Sepharose 4B chromatography, confirming its identity as the membrane-binding peptide. The molecular weight of the membrane-binding peptide was 6400 as determined by gel filtration in 8 M guanidine hydrochloride, and its amino acid content was not especially hydrophobic. The activity of reconstituted hydroxylation systems consisting of reductase, cytochrome P-446, and dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine was not inhibited by large molar excesses of purified membrane-binding peptide. Moreover, when purified reductase and cytochrome P-446 were added to liposomes which contained the membrane-binding peptide, it was determined that mixed function oxidase activity was reconstituted as effectively as when vesicles without the membrane-binding peptides were used. Similar results were obtained with reductase, cytochrome P-450, and detergent-solubilized liposomes (with or without the membrane-binding peptide). Thus, the membrane-binding peptide does not appear to interact with either of these two forms of the hemoprotein in a site-specific manner to prevent reconstitution of hydroxylation activity."

A glycogen synthase kinase (PC0.7) from rabbit skeletal muscle has been shown to phosphorylate the beta subunit of eIF-2. Comparison of highly purified preparations of the two protein kinases has indicated several similarities of properties. 1) Both enzymes were associated with two major polypeptide species, alpha (Mr = 43,000) and beta (Mr = 25,000), and exhibited apparent native molecular weights of 176,000-180,000 by gel filtration and 130,000-140,000 by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. 2) Both enzymes phosphorylated glycogen synthase, eIF-2 beta, phosvitin, and casein and were effective in utilizing GTP and ATP as phosphoryl donors. 3) Both enzymes displayed the same chromatographic behavior on phosvitin-Sepharose, phosphocellulose, and DEAE-cellulose. 4) Both enzymes underwent an autophosphorylation of the beta polypeptide when incubated with ATP and Mg2+. On the basis of these and other properties, we propose that the two protein kinases, if not identical, are very similar enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W82224636,"Abstract We have examined the effect of the delta subunit of the Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase on the formation of closed, open, and stably initiated complexes with Hha I restriction fragments of phage SP82 DNA; the effect of delta on the transcription of these DNA fragments has also been investigated. In vitro, the holoenzyme (core-sigma-delta) bound to and transcribed the same regions of the phage genome that are transcribed in vivo early in infection. In the absence of the delta subunit, the polymerase (core-sigma) bound nonspecifically and transcribed regions of the genome other than those containing early phage genes. Addition of delta to preparations of core-sigma restored the pattern of binding and transcription observed with the holoenzyme. Similarly, delta-less preparations of two SP82-modified forms of polymerase (the enzyme isolated at 8 min after infection and the enzyme isolated 20 min after infection) bound nonspecifically and transcribed regions of the genome other than those containing and genes. Addition of delta to these preparations resulted in patterns of binding and transcription expected for enzymes functioning a middle and late times of infection, respectively. Quantitation of polymerase-DNA complexes at various temperatures, NaCl concentrations, and polymerase-DNA ratios supported the conclusion that delta enhanced promoter selection."
https://openalex.org/W1568049526,"An adsorbent was synthesized by attaching 4-aminophenylphosphorylcholine to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose. A phosphorylcholine (P-choline)-binding protein from rat serum was adsorbed on this affinity column which was eluted by 4 mM P-choline. The protein separated into two bands of Mr = 47,000 and 24,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gradient gels and contained 18% carbohydrate. A serum protein factor, precipitable by 30-50% (NH4)2SO4, was previously shown to inhibit Ca2+-heparin-rat serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) precipitation reaction, whereas P-choline counteracted the action of this protein (Mookerjea, S. (1978) Can. J. Biochem. 56, 746-752). It is now demonstrated that purified P-choline-binding protein prevents Ca2+-heparin-chylomicron or VLDL complex formation and P-choline reverses the effect of this protein. Antibody to P-choline-binding protein raised in rabbits produced a single precipitin line against the pure antigen. The antiserum, however, did not react against rat serum chylomicron, VLDL, low density lipoproteins, or high density lipoprotein. Human serum appears to lack P-choline-binding protein, since (a) the affinity column did not adsorb any such protein, (b) P-choline had no effect on the Ca2+-heparin-serum lipoprotein precipitation reaction, and (c) an immunodiffusion test against the antiserum was negative. However, when P-choline-binding protein was added to human serum, the lipoprotein precipitation was inhibited, and P-choline counteracted the effect of this protein. Preliminary experiments suggested a stoichiometric interaction between P-choline-binding protein and VLDL. Hydrophilic P-choline groups exposed on the surface of VLDL may possibly interact with the P-choline-binding protein and thereby affect the precipitation of lipoproteins by heparin and Ca2+."

Digestion of the monomers labeled with [3H]serine and [35S]methionine with trypsin indicated that serine was enriched (approximately 80%) in the chondroitin sulfate attachment region of the core protein, while methionine was enriched (approximately 60%) in the hyaluronic acid-binding region. Sepharose CL-2B chromatography and velocity gradients were used to isolate monomer subfractions which differed in molecular size. The 3H/35S ratios for the subfractions from monomers labeled with [3H]serine and [35S]methionine were nearly constant, indicating that the core protein lengths were constant regardless of the size of the monomer. Conversely, the 3H/35S ratios for subfractions of monomers labeled with [3H]serine and [35S]sulfate increased significantly with decreasing sizes. Chondroitin sulfate chains in subfractions were released by alkaline borohydride treatment. The mean molecular weights of the chondroitin sulfate chains decreased from approximately 18,500 in the largest subclass of monomers to approximately 12,500 in the smallest. [3H]Serine-labeled monomer subfractions were digested with papain to determine the proportion of serine residues substituted with chondroitin sulfate. The distribution of label was constant for greater than 90% of the monomers from the largest to the smallest. The results indicate that, for at least 90% of the newly synthesized monomers that are able to aggregate, variation in chondroitin sulfate chain size is the only contributing factor to polydispersity in their molecular size."

https://openalex.org/W1531439018,"The intestinal glycosylceramidase of the mouse which we reported previously as a taurodeoxycholate-activated galactosylceramidase (Kobayashi, T., and Suzuki, K. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 1133-1137) has been purified to homogeneity. The enzyme gave a single band of a molecular weight of 130,000 in the sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The molecular weight estimated by Sepharose 4B or Sephadex G-200 gel filtration under nondenaturing conditions was 290,000 to 300,000. In the double immunodiffusion test, rabbit antiserum raised against the purified enzyme gave a single precipitin band against the enzyme, but no cross-reactivity was observed against the brain or kidney galactosylceramidase (EC 3.2.1.46). The purified enzyme was active toward 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-galactoside, beta-D-glucoside, beta-D-xyloside, beta-D-fucoside, and alpha-L-arabinoside. Among potential glycolipid substrates, the enzyme was active, in the presence of sodium taurodeoxycholate, toward galactosylceramide, glucosylceramide, lactosylceramide, galactosylsphingosine, and glucosylsphingosine. It was inactive toward GM1 ganglioside, asialo-GM1 ganglioside, desialylated fetuin, and desialylated transferrin. Among disaccharides, the enzyme showed the highest catalytic activity toward lactose (18.9 mumol/min/mg of protein) and the lowest toward galactose beta (1 leads to 4)-N-acetylglucosamine (0.06 mumol/min/mg of protein). Galactose beta (1 leads to 6)-N-acetylglucosamine was not hydrolyzed. Phlorizin was also a substrate for the enzyme."

Structural study of these oligosaccharide fractions by sequential exoglycosidase digestion in combination with methylation analysis and periodate oxidation has shown that peaks V, VI, and VII are mixtures of 16, 30, and 49 isomeric oligosaccharides. All these 95 oligosaccharides contain Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 lead to 3 repeating structures in their outer chain moieties, indicating that the tissues of GM1-gangliosidosis Type 2 patients do contain beta-galactosidase activity which releases readily galactose residue from such repeating sugar chains."

This enzyme contains 2 Cu2+ and 2 Zn2+/molecule. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum indicates a lack of tryptophan. This enzyme has a molecular weight of 32,000 and is composed of two subunits of equal size, which are joined by noncovalent interactions. Cyanide at 1 and 3 mM inhibits the activity of superoxide dismutase 92 and 100%, but 5 and 10 mM azide caused 15 and 30% inhibition. The isoelectric point, assessed by isoelectric focusing, is 5.3. Amino acid analyses, as well as the spectral and catalytic properties, are reported. The D. melanogaster superoxide dismutase does not cross-react with antibodies to bovine erythrocyte Cu-Zn-containing superoxide dismutase nor to Escherichia coli manganese- and iron-containing superoxide dismutases."
https://openalex.org/W1529304947,"Polyadenosine- and adenosine-diphosphoribosylated proteins of hamster liver were quantitatively isolated with the aid of m-aminophenyl boronic acid glutaryl hydrazide polyacrylamide affinity resin by selective adsorption at pH 8.2 and elution at pH 4.0. Polymer-free proteins, DNA, and RNA are readily separated from adenosine-diphosphoribosylated proteins. The total quantity of proteins that is covalently modified by the homopolymer is 14.3 micrograms/mg of DNA or 37.4 micrograms/g of liver in controls and 38.7 micrograms/mg of DNA or 116 micrograms/g of liver in dimethylnitrosamine-treated hamsters. Polymer content increases from 9 to 15 nmol/mg of DNA to 42 to 118 nmol/mg of DNA following treatment with dimethylnitrosamine. Pulse labeling with [14C]ribose results in a parallel doubling in dimethylnitrosamine-treated animals of the specific activities of adenosine- diphosphoribose and NAD+ and of the [14C]ribose content of polyadenosine-diphosphoribose of chain length between 20 and 40, indicating chain elongation of pre-existing larger polymers. Two groups of proteins that are isolated as polyadenosine-diphosphoribose adducts are increased significantly after treatment with dimethylnitrosamine, one minor component of a mass between 100-112 X 10(3) daltons, and a major group exhibiting a mass of 158-162 X 10(3) daltons. Polyadenosine-diphosphoribose synthetase activity of isolated hepatic nuclei is increased by 32-37% after dimethylnitrosamine treatment, and since the change in glycohydrolase activity is negligible relative to the increase in synthetase, the augmentation of polyadenosine-diphosphoribosylated proteins can be explained by the increased synthetase of nuclei. The molecular size distribution of DNA in liver nuclei of control and dimethylnitrosamine-treated hamsters is indistinguishable."
https://openalex.org/W1515430115,"Nitrate reductase (NADPH:nitrate oxidoreductase; EC 1.6.6.1-3) was purified to apparent homogeneity from mycelium of Penicillium chrysogenum. The final preparation catalyzed the NADPH-dependent, FAD-mediated reduction of nitrate with a specific activity of 170-225 units X mg of protein-1. Gel filtration and glycerol density centrifugation yielded, respectively, a Stokes radius of 6.3 nm and an s20,w of 7.4. The molecular weight was calculated to be 199,000. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, the enzyme displayed two almost contiguous dye-staining bands corresponding to molecular weights of about 97,000 and 98,000. The enzyme prefers NADPH to NADH (kspec ratio = 2813), FAD to FMN (kspec ratio = 141), FAD (+ NADPH) to FADH2 (kspec ratio = 12,000), and nitrate to chlorate (kspec ratio = 4.33), where the kspec (the specificity constant for a given substrate) represents Vmax/Km. The Penicillium enzyme will also catalyze te NADPH-dependent, FAD-mediated reduction of cytochrome c with a specific activity of 647 units X mg of protein-1 (Kmcyt = 1.25 X 10(-5) M), and the reduced methyl viologen (MVH2, i.e. methyl viologen + dithionite)-dependent, NADPH and FAD-independent reduction of nitrate with a specific activity of 250 units X mg of protein-1 kmMVH2 = 3.5 X 10(-6) M). Initial velocity studies showed intersecting NADPH-FAD and nitrate-FAD reciprocal plot patterns. The NADPH-nitrate pattern was a series of parallel lines at saturating and unsaturating FAD levels. NADP+ was competitive with NADPH, uncompetitive with nitrate (at saturating and unsaturating FAD levels), and a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to FAD. Nitrite was competitive with nitrate, uncompetitive with NADPH (at saturating and unsaturating FAD levels), and a mixed-type inhibitor with respect to FAD. At unsaturating nitrate and FAD, NADPH exhibited substrate inhibition, perhaps as a result of binding to the FAD site(s). At very low FAD concentrations, low concentrations of NADP+ activated the reaction slightly. The initial velocity and product inhibition patterns are consistent with either of the two kinetic mechanisms. One (rather unlikely) mechanism involves the rapid equilibrium random binding of all ligands with (a) NADP+ and NADPH mutually exclusive, (b) nitrate and nitrite mutually exclusive, (c) the binding of NADPH strongly inhibiting the binding of nitrate and vice versa, (d) the binding of NADPH strongly promoting the binding of nitrite and vice versa, and (e) the binding of nitrate strongly promoting the binding of NADP+ and vice versa..."
https://openalex.org/W1593923307,"An antigenic secretory protein with cholinesterase activity was isolated from the excretory gland cells of Stephanurus dentatus and was purified by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. The antigenicity of the cholinesterase was demonstrated by an esterase-active immunoprecipitate formed with S. dentatus antiserum and by the ability of the antiserum to protect the enzyme from heat inactivation. The enzyme was found to be secreted by the adult nematodes during in vitro cultivation. The level of cholinesterase activity and its release from the excretory gland cells of the parasite were 27-fold greater in the male than in the female. Ninety per cent of the enzyme activity was localized in the soluble fraction of the gland cells. The molecular weight of the enzyme, estimated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, was 100,000. Two molecular forms were separated by isoelectrofocusing, with isoelectric points of 7.0 and 6.9. At optimum substrate concentrations, the rate of hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine was 8 times greater than that of butyrylthiocholine; the Michaelis constants were 560 microM and 81 microM for acetylthiocholine and butyrylthiocholine, respectively. The enzyme exhibited substrate inhibition at substrate concentrations greater than 10 mM and was inhibited by eserine sulfate, 1,5-bis(4-allyldimethylammoniumphenyl)-pentan-3-one dibromide, Tris, and acetone. The enzyme was highly unstable in dilute protein solutions."
https://openalex.org/W1481326992,"Antisera against a beta-D-galactoside-specific lectin purified to homogeneity from embryonic chick thigh muscle and from adult chicken livers were raised in rabbits. The sera contained antibodies which strongly inhibited the hemagglutinin activity of the lectin. Immune and preimmune [125I]IgG and [125I]Fab preparations were tested for ability to bind to monolayers of cultured chick myoblasts and showed no significant differences in binding. Thus, we were unable to detect the lectin on the cell surface. When added to myoblast cultures, the purified lectin had no influence on the process of myoblast fusion. Furthermore, neither anti-lectin IgG nor Fab fragments interfered with myotube formation when present at high concentration in fusing cultures. On the basis of these results, we conclude that intercellular interactions between the lectin and complementary cell surface receptors do not play a role in myoblast adhesion and fusion in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1592987008,"The polychlorinated biphenyls mixture, Aroclor 1254, generally considered a powerful inducer of rat hepatic and pulmonary microsomal monooxygenases, caused a 70% decrease in ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity, a 31% decrease in benzo(a)pyrene hydroxylase activity, and a 42% decrease in cytochrome P-450 content in rabbit lung microsomes. When pulmonary cytochrome P-450 was solubilized and subjected to column chromatography, the elution profiles of the two forms of the hemeprotein showed a marked decrease in cytochrome P-450I in treated rabbits, with no significant alteration in cytochrome P-450II content. These data were confirmed by subjecting the two cytochromes to gel electrophoresis and staining the electrophoretic bands for protein and heme-associated peroxidase activity. Cytochromes P-450I and P-450II isolated from Aroclor 1254-treated rabbits showed differences in spectral properties as well as in their stabilities. The CO difference spectral determinations showed absorbance maxima at 452 and 450 nm for cytochromes P-450I and P-450II, respectively. At room temperature, cytochrome P-450II was much more stable than P-450I. The present studies provide evidence not only for species differences in the biological actions of the polychlorinated biphenyls but also demonstrate differential effects of the environmental pollutant on the two major forms of cytochrome P-450 and associated enzymic activities in rabbit lungs."

It interacts stoichiometrically with Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu to form an elongation factor Tu.elongation factor Ts complex."
https://openalex.org/W2140686908,"Incubation of a preparation of cardiac plasma membranes with 20 microM (--)-isoproterenol and 1 microM guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) results in prolonged and maximal activation of adenylate cyclase and prolonged binding of [3H]Gpp(NH)p to the membranes. The total number of [3H]Gpp(NH)p sites must exceed those required for enzyme activation (N-sites) since the rate of binding is much slower than the rate of activation. Attempts to measure the amount of [3H]Gpp(NH)p released from N-sites during incubation of membranes with isoproterenol and GTP were frustrated by limited (about 20%) reversal of binding and of enzyme activation. However, the amount of [3H]-Gpp(NH)p bound to membranes could be reduced by preincubating them in a concentration of App(NH)p (0.1-0.5 mM) which does not interact with the N-site and most of the [3H]Gpp(NH)p subsequently bound could be removed by further incubation of the membranes with EDTA, propranolol, and Gpp(NH)p. Under these conditions, full enzyme activation was retained and was associated with residual bound [3H]Gpp(NH)p of about 0.3 pmol/mg of protein. This amount equals the concentration of beta-adrenoreceptors; and the rate and Kd (0.22 microM) for the binding residual [3H]-Gpp(NH)p approximate the rate and Ka for enzyme activation. The rate of enzyme activation and [3H]-Gpp(NH)p binding to the residual component was increased in the presence of isoproterenol. Competition binding studies for the residual component revealed that Gpp(NH)p congruent to GTP greater than GDP greater than GMP. The results suggest that residual [3H]Gpp(NH)p binding is to the adenylate cyclase-coupled guanine nucleotide binding protein."
https://openalex.org/W2416515604,"In contrast to previous reports, fluorescence and ultraviolet difference spectroscopy are shown to reflect the interaction of the inhibitor, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate, with thymidylate synthetase isolated from amethopterin-resistant Lactobacillus casei. Analysis of the quenching of protein fluorescence upon nucleotide binding yields a value of 2.1 X 10(5) M-1 for the association constant for binary complex formation. The ultraviolet difference spectrum for the nucleotide-enzyme complex exhibited a broad trough with the greatest loss of absorbance centered at 275 nm. Results of previous circular dichroic studies of nucleotide-enzyme binary complexes showed apparently parallel changes in ellipticity in the 267-269-nm and 290-nm regions, which were interpreted to reflect coordinated alteration in nucleotide and enzyme structure, respectively. When examined by difference circular dichroic spectroscopy, the nucleotide-enzyme interaction is accompanied by a substantial loss in ellipticity from 250 to 300 nm which is greatest at 280 nm. We interpret the results obtained from the three light spectroscopic techniques as indications of subtle alterations in the environments of certain tyrosine and tryptophan residues in the enzyme which are caused by the association of 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridylate with the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1583571182,"A deacetylase-thiolesterase that cleaves both the amide and thiolester bonds of 4-acetamidobutyryl CoA has been highly purified from extracts of Pseudomonas B4 grown in a medium containing L-beta-lysine (3,6-diaminohexanoate) as the main energy source. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 275,000 and contains 8 apparently identical subunits of 36,500 daltons. Products of 4-acetamidobutyryl CoA degradation are stoichiometric amounts of CoASH and acetate, variable amounts of 4-aminobutyrate and its lactam, 2-pyrrolidinone, and a little 4-acetamidobutyrate. The relative yields of 4-aminobutyrate and 2-pyrrolidinone are determined by the enzyme level. At high enzyme levels the 4-aminobutyrate/pyrrolidinone ratio is about 2, whereas at low enzyme levels only pyrrolidinone is formed. Under the latter conditions, 4-aminobutyryl CoA accumulates transiently and is converted nonenzymatically to pyrrolidinone and CoASH. Since the enzyme does not form 4-aminobutyrate from synthetic or enzymatically formed 4-aminobutyryl CoA, we conclude that a 4-aminobutyryl CoA-enzyme complex is the actual precursor of 4-aminobutyrate, whereas free 4-aminobutyryl CoA is the precursor of pyrrolidinone. Several analogs of 4-acetamidobutyryl CoA containing different amino acid or amide moieties, and several simple acyl CoA compounds are utilized by the enzyme; 4-propionamidobutyryl CoA and 5-acetamidovaleryl CoA are most readily decomposed. Acetyl CoA is a very poor substrate. 3-Acetamidopropionyl CoA is first converted to acetate and beta-alanyl CoA and the latter compound is slowly hydrolyzed to beta-alanine and CoASH. Little deacetylase-thiolesterase is formed by bacteria grown in absence of beta-lysine, but another thiolesterase, lacking deacetylase activity, is produced. The deacetylase-thiolesterase catalyzes an essential step in the aerobic degradation of L-beta-lysine."
