https://openalex.org/W2081865729,"Pistillate flower formation in monoecious cucumber plants is increased when allyl trimethylammonium bromide is added to aerated solution cultures used as the root medium. By contrast, gibberellin induces staminate flower formation on gynoecious cucumber plants. The two chemicals also have diametrically opposite effects in tendril formation and vegetative extension."
https://openalex.org/W2088957207,"Fossil resources can be conserved by the use of renewable resources, primarily wood, either for the generation of energy or by the production of synthetic polymers using renewable materials as feedstocks. The sources of renewable resources for energy generation are summarized. The forms of energy generation possible from biomass are discussed. The production of chemicals and polymers from biomass is somewhat limited but still of conservation value. The chemical and by-product potential of renewable resources is evaluated. Production of chemicals by gasification is also briefly considered. (JSR)"

When an estimated contribution from dry deposition is subtracted from the measured total, the strontium-90 concentration in precipitation is seen to be independent of the amount of precipitation."

https://openalex.org/W2013679562,"National forests are a valuable national asset. They produce important amounts of wood, recreation, wilderness, wildlife, and water, but good management could produce much more of each kind of output. The national forests are a major business enterprise, with $42 billion of assets and an annual cash revenue of $400 million to $500 million, but they have never been studied as business enterprises. The national forests are capital-intensive, but the capital is used wastefully, in large part because no charge is made for its use. Funds for management and investment are spent in economically unrewarding regions, forests, and sites. The availability of so much of their output at little or no cost to users seriously distorts management decisions. Major reforms in the management of the national forests are needed. If carried out, these could make the national forests much more useful to the American public."

The interdependence of energy and materials has been increasing and will continue to increase as the more easily won raw materials are exhausted and as the energy conversion and utilization schemes become more sophisticated. The author stresses the materials technology that will be required in major developing systems for extracting, converting, distributing, and using energy--emphasizing that development of suitable materials often takes many years. A detailed schematic is shown that represents the energy sources; methods of processing, conversion, transmission, and storage; and forms of fuel energy that may exist in the near term, up to about 1990. The schematic indicates that uranium, gas, coal, and oil will probably still contribute more than 95 percent of the total energy flow in 1990. For the near term, coal liquefaction, coal gasification, water-moderated reactors, municipal waste, high-temperature turbines, and geothermal will contribute up to 5 percent. For the midterm, 1990 to 2005, fast breeder reactors, photovoltaic conversion of solar energy to electricity, MHD, and flywheels should contribute significantly. The projections for controlled fusion in the year 2005 and beyond are summarized. The magnitude ofmore » the problem involves sustained effort from universities, industrial organizations, and government laboratories, guided by close interplay with energy system designers.
