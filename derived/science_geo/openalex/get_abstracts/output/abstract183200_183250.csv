https://openalex.org/W1979077763,"Subthreshold-activating somatodendritic A-type potassium channels have fundamental roles in neuronal signaling and plasticity which depend on their unique cellular localization, voltage dependence, and kinetic properties. Some of the components of A-type K(+) channels have been identified; however, these do not reproduce the properties of the native channels, indicating that key molecular factors have yet to be unveiled. We purified A-type K(+) channel complexes from rat brain membranes and found that DPPX, a protein of unknown function that is structurally related to the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase and cell adhesion protein CD26, is a novel component of A-type K(+) channels. DPPX associates with the channels' pore-forming subunits, facilitates their trafficking and membrane targeting, reconstitutes the properties of the native channels in heterologous expression systems, and is coexpressed with the pore-forming subunits in the somatodendritic compartment of CNS neurons."

https://openalex.org/W2144146934,"Several theories have proposed a functional role for response synchronization in sensory perception. Critics of these theories have argued that selective synchronization is physiologically implausible when cortical networks operate at high levels of activity. Using intracellular recordings from visual cortex in vivo, in combination with numerical simulations, we find dynamic changes in spike threshold that reduce cellular sensitivity to slow depolarizations and concurrently increase the relative sensitivity to rapid depolarizations. Consistent with this, we find that spike activity and high-frequency fluctuations in membrane potential are closely correlated and that both are more tightly tuned for stimulus orientation than the mean membrane potential. These findings suggest that under high-input conditions the spike-generating mechanism adaptively enhances the sensitivity to synchronous inputs while simultaneously decreasing the sensitivity to temporally uncorrelated inputs."
https://openalex.org/W2056752966,"We recorded neurons from the hippocampus of freely behaving rats during an auditory fear conditioning task. Rats received either paired or unpaired presentations of an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS) and an electric shock unconditioned stimulus (US). Hippocampal neurons (place and theta cells) acquired responses to the auditory CS in the paired but not in the unpaired group. After CS-US pairing, rhythmic firing of theta cells became synchronized to the onset of the CS. Conditioned responses of place cells were gated by their location-specific firing, so that after CS-US pairing, place cells responded to the CS only when the rat was within the cell's place field. These findings may help to elucidate how the hippocampus contributes to context-specific memory formation during associative learning."

https://openalex.org/W1970534381,"Cross-talk between calpain and caspase proteolytic systems has complicated efforts to determine their distinct roles in apoptotic cell death. This study examined the effect of overexpressing calpastatin, the specific endogenous calpain inhibitor, on the activity of the two proteolytic systems following an apoptotic stimulus. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were stably transfected with full-length human calpastatin cDNA resulting in 20-fold overexpression based on Western blot and 5-fold greater calpain inhibitory activity in cell extracts. Wild type and calpastatin overexpressing (CST1) cells were neuronally differentiated and apoptosis-induced with staurosporine (0.1-1.0 microm). Calpastatin overexpression decreased calpain activation, increased caspase-3-like activity, and accelerated the appearance of apoptotic nuclear morphology. Following 0.1-0.2 microm staurosporine, plasma membrane integrity based on calcein-acetoxymethyl fluorescence was significantly greater at 24 h in differentiated CST1 compared with differentiated wild type cells. However, this protective effect was lost at higher staurosporine doses (0.5-1.0 microm), which resulted in pronounced caspase-mediated degradation of the overexpressed calpastatin. These results suggest a dual role for calpains during neuronal apoptosis. In the early execution phase, calpain down-regulates caspase-3-like activity and slows progression of apoptotic nuclear morphology. Subsequent calpain activity, facilitated by caspase-mediated degradation of calpastatin, contributes to plasma membrane disruption and secondary necrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1965093955,"The survival signal elicited by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt1 pathway has been correlated with inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins and attenuation of the general stress-induced increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the mechanisms by which this pathway regulates intracellular ROS levels remain largely unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that nerve growth factor (NGF) prevents the accumulation of ROS in dopaminergic PC12 cells challenged with the Parkinson's disease-related neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) by a mechanism that involves PI3K/Akt-dependent induction of the stress response protein heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). The effect of NGF was mimicked by induction of HO-1 expression with CoCl2; by treatment with bilirubin, an end product of heme catabolism; and by infection with a retroviral expression vector for human HO-1. The relevance of HO-1 in NGF-induced ROS reduction was further demonstrated by the evidence that cells treated with the HO-1 inhibitor tin-protoporphyrin or infected with a retroviral expression vector for antisense HO-1 exhibited enhanced ROS release in response to 6-OHDA, despite the presence of the neurotrophin. Inhibition of PI3K prevented NGF induction of HO-1 mRNA and protein and partially reversed its protective effect against 6-OHDA-induced ROS release. By contrast, cells transfected with a membrane-targeted active version of Akt1 exhibited increased HO-1 expression, even in the absence of NGF, and displayed a greatly attenuated production of ROS and apoptosis in response to 6-OHDA. These observations indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway controls the intracellular levels of ROS by regulating the expression of the antioxidant enzyme HO-1.

Neurotrophins, including nerve growth factor (NGF), promote survival of target neurons and attenuate ROS-induced cell death (2Wiesmann C. Ultsch M.H. Bass S.H. de Vos A.M. Nature. 1999; 401: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). A prominent mechanism involved in NGF-induced cell survival consists of the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream effectors, including the protein kinase B/Akt family of Ser/Thr kinases (3Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar, 4Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem.

This pathway exerts protective actions against oxidative damage in central and peripheral neurons (6Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). In this context, neuregulin prevents H2O2 induction of ROS in a PI3K-dependent manner (7Goldshmit Y. Erlich S. Pinkas-Kramarski R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46379-46385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Loss of oxidative stress tolerance with aging has been linked in part to reduced Akt kinase activity in old rats (8Ikeyama S. Kokkonen G. Shack S. Wang X.T. Holbrook N.J. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Concerning neurodegeneration, we have recently reported the protective effect of active Akt1 against peptides of β-amyloid protein, characteristic of senile plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients (9Martı́n D. Salinas M. Lopez-Valdaliso R. Serrano E. Recuero M. Cuadrado A. J.

In these cases, expression of a constitutively active version of Akt prevented the increase in ROS that follows treatment of PC12 cells with these toxins. reactive oxygen species nerve growth factor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase heme oxygenase 6-hydroxydopamine enhanced green fluorescent protein myristoylated hydroethidine phycoerythrin 7-aminoactinomycin D However, although those studies support an involvement of Akt in counteracting oxidative damage in neurons, a direct role of this pathway in the regulation of canonical antioxidant defenses, represented by the superoxide dismutases and/or the catalase/glutathione peroxidase system, has not been identified. On the contrary, recent reports on the dauer stage ofCaenorhabditis elegans and quiescent mammalian cells indicate that, in the absence of active PI3K and Akt, forkhead transcription factors (DAF-16 and FOXO3a, respectively) increase the expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (12Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 13Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W.A. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medena R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutations in the daf-2 network of C. elegans that inactivate PI3K and Akt lead to up-regulation of a cytosolic catalase (14Tabú J. Lau J.F. Ma C. Hahn J.H. Hoque R. Rothblatt J. Chalfie M. Nature. 1999; 399: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar); and in Drosophila melanogaster, inactivation of this pathway results in increased superoxide dismutase activity (15Clancy D.J. Gems D. Harshman L.G. Oldham S. Stocker H. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of PI3K and Akt must lead to up-regulation of other ROS detoxification systems. In addition to the well characterized ROS scavenger systems mentioned above, emerging evidence supports a role for heme oxygenase (HO) enzymes as important components of the cellular antioxidant armamentarium (16Morse D. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 17Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The heme oxygenase family is composed of at least two well characterized isoenzymes: inducible HO-1 and constitutive HO-2. HO-1, also known as HSP32 (heatshock protein of 32 kDa), is a stress response protein whose expression is induced in practically all tissues and cells tested in response to multiple oxidative insults such as heme, UV light, heavy metals, glutathione depletion, and H2O2. This enzyme catalyzes the stepwise degradation of heme to release free iron and equimolar concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and the linear tetrapyrrol biliverdin, which is converted to bilirubin by the enzyme biliverdin reductase. Many reports have established the potent antioxidant activity of biliverdin and bilirubin and the cytoprotective actions of CO on vascular endothelium and nerve cells (16Morse D. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 17Otterbein L.E. Choi A.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L1029-L1037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Baranano D.E.

Regul. 2000; 36: 181-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is now widely accepted that induction of heme catabolism represents an adaptive, and ultimately protective, response to oxidative injury. Of particular relevance to this study, it has also been shown that the normally low levels of HO-1 expression in neurons (20Ewing J.F. Haber S.N. Maines M.D. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1140-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 21Takeda A. Onodera H. Sugimoto A. Itoyama Y. Kogure K. Shibahara S. Brain Res. 1994; 666: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) dramatically increase after formation of brain neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's patients (22Takeda A. Perry G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5395-5399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and neuronal Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's patients (23Schipper H.M. Liberman A. Stopa E.G. Exp. Neurol. 1998; 150: 60-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and that cerebellar granular neurons overexpressing HO-1 are resistant to glutamate-mediated oxidative stress (24Chen K. Gunter K. Maines M.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The progressive deterioration of catecholaminergic cells in Parkinson's patients has been attributed, at least in part, to the high vulnerability of these cells to oxidative damage. One potential source of ROS in the substantia nigra includes the autoxidation of the neurotransmitter dopamine to generate 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (25Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). In fact, 6-OHDA is present in rodent and human brains and has been widely used in experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Evidences derived from in vivo and in vitro experimental models of this disease have demonstrated that 6-OHDA neurotoxicity involves oxidative damage to catecholaminergic neurons (26Lotharius J. Dugan L.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1284-1293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) via the generation of hydroxyl radicals, monoamine oxidase-mediated formation of H2O2, and mitochondrial generation of superoxide (25Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). With the aim to determine whether PI3K and Akt modulate the heme oxygenase system of ROS detoxification, we analyzed the effect of NGF on the regulation of HO-1 expression in catecholaminergic PC12 cells. We show that NGF-induced activation of PI3K/Akt up-regulates the expression and activity of HO-1, which, in turn, provides protection against 6-OHDA-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells. These data contribute to revealing the mechanism whereby NGF and PI3K/Akt provide protection against oxidative injury and may be potentially relevant in the development of new therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease. PC12 cells (a gift of Dr. H. Kleinman, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7.5% fetal bovine serum, 7.5% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 80 μg/ml gentamycin. Eukaryotic expression vectors for enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and myristoylated (myr)-EGFP-Akt1 have been described elsewhere (13Kops G.J. Dansen T.B. Polderman P.E. Saarloos I. Wirtz K.W.A. Coffer P.J. Huang T.T. Bos J.L. Medena R.H. Burgering B.M.T. Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar). Stable transfection of PC12 cells was performed with Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amphotropic retroviral packaging cell lines PT67 and PA317 (Clontech) were used to collect replication-deficient retroviruses containing the retroviral vector (LXSN) expressing human HO-1antisense cDNA under the control of the human HO-1 promoter (LSN-HOP-HHO-1-AS) and human HO-1 in the sense orientation (LSN-HHO-1), respectively. These retroviral constructs have been described elsewhere (27Quan S. Yang L. Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12203-12208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PC12 cells infected with the pLNCX retroviral vector (a generous gift of Dr. R. Perona, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid) were used as controls for HO-1 infections. Transfected and infected cells were selected in 0.5 mg/ml G418. The reagents employed were NGF (Peprotec, Rocky Hill, NJ), tin-protoporphyrin (Protoporphyrin Products, Logan, UT), and 6-OHDA, actinomycin D, cycloheximide, LY294002, hemin, bilirubin, and CoCl2 (Sigma). Microsomal HO-1 activity was determined spectrophotometrically in PC12 cell microsomes incubated for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C in the presence of hemin (10 μm), NADPH (20 μm), and 1 mg of protein from rat liver cytosol as a source of biliverdin reductase (28Ryter S.W. Kvam E. Tyrrell R.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 99: 369-391PubMed Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by adding 1 ml of chloroform, and the concentration of bilirubin was determined from the difference in absorbance between 464 and 530 nm using an extinction coefficient of 40 mm–1cm−1. Total cellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63176) Google Scholar). Equal amounts (1 μg) of RNA from the different treatments were reversed-transcribed (75 min, 42 °C) using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Amplification of cDNA was performed in 25 μl of PCR buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 9.0) containing 2.5 mmdigoxigenin-dUTP, 0.6 units of Taq DNA polymerase, and 30 pmol of synthetic gene-specific primers for HO-1 (forward, 5′-AAGGCTTTAAGCTGGTGATGG-3′; and reverse, 5′-AGCGGTGTCTGGGATGAACTA-3′). To ensure that equal amounts of reverse-transcribed RNA were added to the PCR, the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin housekeeping gene was amplified using commercially available oligonucleotides (Clontech). After an initial denaturation step (4 min, 94 °C), amplification of each cDNA was performed for 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25 cycles (HO-1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or β-actin) using a thermal profile of 1 min at 94 °C (denaturation), 1 min at 58 °C (annealing), and 1 min at 72 °C (elongation). The optimal number of cycles within the linear range of amplification were selected as 23 for HO-1 and 19 for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase or β-actin (data not shown). The amplified PCR products were resolved by 1.8% agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to nylon membranes. Chemiluminescence detection was performed with a digoxigenin luminescence detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Basel, Switzerland). Primary anti-HO-1 antibodies were purchased from Stressgen and Oxys. Anti-protein-disulfide isomerase antibodies were a gift from Dr. J. G. Castaño (Instituto de Investigaciones Biomédicas, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı́ficas). Cells were grown in 60-cm plates, washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed on ice with 200 μl of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mmNa3VO4). Lysates were precleared by centrifugation, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp., Madrid, Spain). Blots were analyzed with anti-HO-1 antibodies (1:1000). Appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000) were used to detect the proteins of interest by enhanced chemiluminescence. Relative protein levels were determined by scanning densitometry and analysis with NIH Image software. Cells were seeded on glass-bottom 35-mm plates (Willco, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Following overnight serum starvation, cells were incubated with 40 μm 6-OHDA for 6 h or with 1 mm H2O2 for 45 min and afterward with 2 μm hydroethidine (HE) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h at 37 °C. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Leica SP2 system. For HE, we used an excitation wavelength of 488 nm, and fluorescence was detected at wavelengths between 557 and 740 nm. For Hoechst 33258, we used an excitation wavelength of 351 nm, and fluorescence was detected at wavelengths between 386 and 512 nm. A FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, Madrid) was used to analyze fluorescence from HE (band pass 575/24 nm), annexin V-phycoerythrin (PE) (band pass 620/22 nm), and 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) (band pass 575/24 nm). Intracellular ROS were detected with HE. Cells were detached from the plates, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 2 μm HE for 1 h at 37 °C, and analyzed immediately. Base-line incorporation of the probe was determined in serum-starved cells incubated in 2 μm HE at 4 °C. Variations in HE fluorescence between experiments were attributed to slight differences in the photomultiplier parameters used during data acquisition and to small differences among batches of HE. For apoptosis assays, floating and attached cells were transferred to conical tubes and spun at 300 × g for 10 min. Cells were resuspended in annexin V binding buffer (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) at 106cells/ml. Cells were incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in a 1:20 solution of annexin V-PE (Pharmingen, Madrid) supplemented with 1 μg/ml 7-AAD (Sigma) and analyzed immediately. Student's t test was used to assess differences between groups. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Unless indicated, all experiments were performed al least three times with similar results. The values in graphs correspond to the average of at least three samples. Bars indicate S.D. To assess variations in ROS production, we used the ROS-sensitive fluorescent probe HE, a well established sensor of oxidative stress, most specific of superoxide anion (10Salinas M. Martı́n D. Alvarez A. Cuadrado A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 30Bindokas V.P. Jordan J. Lee C.C. Miller R.J. J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 9796-9801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are the primary sites of HE oxidation; and once converted to ethidine, this product accumulates intercalated into nucleic acids at the nucleus (31Bindokas V.P. Kuznetsov A. Sreenan S. Polonsky K.S. Roe M.W. Philipson L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9796-9801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Serum-starved PC12 cells were treated with 40 μm 6-OHDA for 6 h or with 1 mm H2O2 for 45 min as a control of oxidative stress, and 2 μm HE was added for 1 h. As shown in Fig.1A, counterstaining of these cells with the nuclear dye Hoechst 33258 and analysis with confocal microscopy evidenced HE accumulation mostly in the nuclei of cells submitted to oxidative damage. We then quantified the incorporation of HE in 6-OHDA-treated cells by flow cytometry as shown in Fig.1B. Untreated cells exhibited weak HE incorporation, indicating that the basal amount of ROS in these cells is low. By contrast, 6-OHDA induced a dose-dependent incorporation of the probe. Similar results were obtained with the green-emitting fluorophore 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (data not shown). However, because heme and hemoproteins may interfere with the oxidation of this dye in a ROS-independent manner (32Ohashi T. Mizutani A. Murakami A. Kojo S. Ishii T. Taketani S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we concentrated the rest our work on HE. Next, we analyzed the effect of NGF on prevention of 6-OHDA-induced release of ROS. As shown in Fig.2A, a 16-h pretreatment with 20 ng/ml NGF significantly reduced the 6-OHDA-induced incorporation of HE, indicating that NGF attenuates ROS production. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2B, this effect was dependent on the length of NGF pretreatment. Thus, attenuation of ROS release by NGF required the presence of this neurotrophin at least 3 h prior to the addition of 6-OHDA. These results suggest that NGF induces the expression of a gene(s) essential to ROS antagonism. Considering that HO-1 is an inducible enzyme with strong antioxidant properties, we studied the effect of NGF on the expression of this protein. Treatment of PC12 cells for 6 h with NGF resulted in a 2–3-fold increase in HO activity (Fig. 3A). This increase was sensitive to pretreatment with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, suggesting that NGF enhances the expression of the inducible heme oxygenase isoform, HO-1. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 3(B and C), the increase in HO activity correlated with increased levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein. Moreover, the increase in mRNA was also sensitive to cycloheximide, suggesting, in agreement with other studies (33Chen K. Maines M.D. Cell. Mol. Biol. 2000; 46: 609-617PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hill-Kapturczak N. Truong L. Thamilselvan V. Visner G.A Nick H.S. Agarwal A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40904-40909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), that induction of HO-1 transcription involves de novo protein synthesis. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3D, NGF markedly elevated HO-1 mRNA, reaching a maximum within 3 h of treatment and declining by 9 h of NGF exposure. In addition, induction of HO-1 protein by NGF was delayed (Fig. 3E). There was a slight increase observed at 1.5–3 h, with a maximum 6–8-fold elevation at 9 h; but HO-1 protein levels remained elevated for at least for 12 h after NGF stimulation. NGF failed to stimulate HO-2 expression (data not shown), further indicating that this neurotrophic factor specifically up-regulates the HO-1 isoform. To assess the relevance of HO-1 in 6-OHDA detoxification, we treated PC12 cells with CoCl2, a well established inducer of HO-1 expression that promotes depletion of the intracellular GSH pool and does not appear to significantly alter the activity of other antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (35Llesuy S.F. Tomaro M.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1223: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Heme oxygenase expression was induced in PC12 cells following incubation with CoCl2 for 12 h as indicated in Fig.4A. Plateau induction of HO-1 protein was observed with ∼100 μm CoCl2. Contrary to hemin, another commonly used inducer of HO-1, CoCl2 did not display significant toxicity, at least for the length of these experiments (data not shown). Following 12 h of CoCl2 induction of HO-1, cells were treated with 6-OHDA as indicated in Fig. 4B. CoCl2 pretreatment strongly attenuated the production of ROS in the presence of 6-OHDA. To further confirm that the CoCl2 protection was due to induction of HO-1, we analyzed the protective effect of bilirubin. Serum-starved cells were pretreated with 10 μm bilirubin for 12 h prior to the treatment with 6-OHDA. As shown in Fig.4B, bilirubin also significantly attenuated the 6-OHDA induction of ROS, although to a lesser extent compared with CoCl2. These results indicate that induction of HO-1 prevents ROS production by 6-OHDA. We also overexpressed HO-1 in PC12 cells and determined its effect on 6-OHDA-induced HE fluorescence. PC12 cells were infected with the retroviral expression vector LSN-HHO-1, which has been described previously (27Quan S. Yang L. Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12203-12208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We could not find cell clones with levels of HO-1 overexpression higher than 2–3-fold, suggesting that higher constitutive levels of HO activity may be deleterious (see “Discussion”), probably as a result of the depletion of intracellular heme reservoirs. A pool of five clones overexpressing HO-1 by 2.3 ± 0.3-fold (Fig. 4C) was used to assess the relevance of this enzyme in the 6-OHDA-induced production of ROS. Although modest, comparative levels of overexpression conferred protection against glutamate-mediated oxidative stress in neurons of transgenic mice (24Chen K. Gunter K. Maines M.D. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 304-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4D, HO-1-overexpressing cells exhibited a 6-OHDA-induced HE incorporation that was intermediate between that induced by the toxin in control untreated and NGF-treated cells. These results further suggest an antioxidant effect of HO-1. Interestingly, NGF produced a similar attenuation of ROS in both control and HO-1-overexpressing cells in the presence of 6-OHDA, suggesting that the levels of HO-1 induced by the neurotrophin may be already at saturating doses. An additional interpretation might be that NGF induces other antioxidant genes or pathways that, in concert with HO-1, facilitate maximum protection against 6-OHDA-induced ROS (see “Discussion”). To determine the relevance of HO-1 induction in the NGF protection against oxidative stress, we analyzed the effect of pharmacological inhibition of heme oxygenase with tin-protoporphyrin, a competitive inhibitor of HO-1. PC12 cells were treated with 20 ng/ml NGF and various tin-protoporphyrin concentrations in combination as indicated in Fig. 5A. Tin-protoporphyrin alone dose-dependently increased HE incorporation, indicating that inhibition of heme oxygenase increases cellular ROS levels. Interestingly, NGF could not prevent ROS generation in the presence of tin-protoporphyrin either in untreated cells or in cells treated with 6-OHDA, particularly at the highest doses. We also analyzed the 6-OHDA-induced HE incorporation in cells retrovirally transduced with antisense HO-1 constructs. The antisense retroviral expression vector for HO-1 under the control of its own promoter (LSN-HOP-HHO-1-AS) has been described previously (27Quan S. Yang L. Abraham N.G. Kappas A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12203-12208Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports (36Li Volti G. Wang J. Traganos F. Kappas A. Abraham N.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 1077-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), cells transfected with this antisense constructs grew more slowly (data not shown), suggesting abnormalities in cell cycle progression. Fig. 5B shows the endogenous levels of HO-1 in control PC12 cells and in two clones (AS1 and AS2) selected after retroviral transduction with LSN-HOP-HHO-1-AS. Both cell clones exhibited lower HO-1 protein levels compared with control cells (54 ± 8 and 46 ± 12% of the control for AS1 and AS2, respectively). Moreover, hemin yielded lower HO-1 protein levels in both antisense clones, indicating that HO-1 expression is impaired in these cells. We then analyzed the levels of 6-OHDA-induced incorporation of HE as shown in Fig. 5C. Treatment with 40 μm 6-OHDA induced a significantly higher incorporation of HE in the antisense clones compared with control cells, indicative of stronger production of ROS in the HO-1-depleted cells. Interestingly, pretreatment with NGF for 16 h did not prevent 6-OHDA induction of ROS in either of the antisense HO-1-transduced cells. These observations suggest that induction of HO-1 is essential for NGF to attenuate 6-OHDA-induced production of ROS; and because both antisense clones still harbor a fraction of HO-1 protein, it is likely that cells require a threshold amount of HO-1, above that present in these cells, to be efficiently protected against this neurotoxin. Taken together, these results further support a role for HO-1 in the NGF-induced antioxidant response. Next, we investigated the contribution of the NGF-activated PI3K/Akt survival pathway to the inducti"

We used proteomic tools to analyze ESP proteins and determined the recognition of these individual proteins by hyperimmune sera.

Therefore, the data base of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) and a data base consisting of contigs fromHaemonchus ESTs were also consulted for identification. Approximately 200 individual spots were observed in the two-dimensional gel. Comprehensive proteomics analysis, combined with bioinformatic search tools, identified 107 proteins in 102 spots. The data include known as well as novel proteins such as serine, metallo- and aspartyl proteases, in addition to H. contortus ESP components like Hc24, Hc40, Hc15, and apical gut GA1 proteins. Novel proteins were identified from matches with H. contortus ESTs displaying high similarity with proteins like cyclophilins, nucleoside diphosphate kinase, OV39 antigen, and undescribed homologues ofCaenorhabditis elegans. Of special note is the finding of microsomal peptidase H11, a vaccine candidate previously regarded as a “hidden antigen” because it was not found in ESP. Extensive sequence variation is present in the abundant Hc15 proteins. The Hc15 isoforms are differentially recognized by hyperimmune sera, pointing to a possible specific role of Hc15 in the infectious process and/or in immune evasion. This concept and the identification of multiple novel immune-recognized components in ESP should assist future vaccine development strategies.

Among the GI nematodes, Haemonchus contortus is economically important because of its blood feeding characteristics in the abomasum; it is able to cause severe losses in production of small ruminant herds. The parasitic stages of the developmental cycle occur in a single host, and during each phase the nematode releases a variety of molecules into the host or in vitro culture environment. These are usually referred to as excretory/secretory products (ESP). ESP are of practical value as a source of potential vaccine components. Obtained after in vitro cultivation of adult worms in serum-free medium, ESP or its partially purified fractions are able to induce 65 to 907 protection against H. contortus in sheep (1Schallig H.D. van Leeuwen M.A. Cornelissen A.W. Parasite Immunol. 1997; 19: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 2Vervelde L. Van Leeuwen M.A. Kruidenier M. Kooyman F.N. Huntley J.F. Van Die I. Cornelissen A.W. Parasite Immunol. 2002; 24: 189-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), but protective properties have not conclusively been attributed to individual proteins. Regardless of its practical use in vaccination studies, there is hardly any conclusive evidence on the biological function of ESP. For some proteins, functional roles have been proposed on the basis of similarity to other proteins in sequence data bases (3Loukas A. Doedens A. Hintz M. Maizels R.M. Parasitology. 2000; 121: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Gems D. Ferguson C.J. Robertson B.D. Nieves R. Page A.P. Blaxter M.L. Maizels R.M. J. Biol.

Parasitol. 1993; 76: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the surface of the cuticle may be constituted of proteins derived from the secretory system (7Bird A.F. Bird J. The Structure of Nematodes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1991: 167-229Crossref Google Scholar). The secretion of some proteins has been linked in time to the transition of free-living stages to parasitism (8Hawdon J.M. Jones B.F. Hoffman D.R. Hotez P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6672-6678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The identification of the proteins present in ESP of H. contortus using a proteomics approach will provide a basis for studies on the following matters. (i) Identification of ES proteins as the products of specific genes, enabling bioinformatic analyses and much more specific functional studies. (ii) The complexity of ES, which has hardly been addressed by the almost exclusive use of one-dimensional gel electrophoresis. (iii) The variability between batches of ESP, a topic highly relevant to vaccination studies. (iv) The recognition of specific spots by immune sera, especially in cases where multiple spots are derived from the expression of multigene families or from variations in post-translational modifications. (v) The cellular origin of ESP. Among others, ESP can contain proteins secreted by the pharyngeal glands, the excretory system, epithelial cells of the intestine (e.g. digestive enzymes), or rectal and vaginal cells (7Bird A.F. Bird J. The Structure of Nematodes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press Ltd., London1991: 167-229Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, cytosolic components of decaying cells (either by apoptosis or other causes of damage) may be present in addition to epithelial membrane proteins that are cleaved off. Here we have described 107 identifications in the ESP of adults ofH. contortus from gene sequence information deposited in GenBankTM nr as well as from H. contortus dbEST tag sequences. A number of the identified proteins have previously been associated with a protective immune response, although in several cases their presence in ESP has not been reported. For many proteins we have now shown that they appear in truncated forms or have extensive sequence modifications, which may complicate the design of vaccination strategies. Furthermore, many proteins have been detected in ESP for the first time and will be discussed with regard to their potential function and relation to an immune response. Standard procedures for harvesting ESP have been used as described for H. contortus and other nematodes (3Loukas A. Doedens A. Hintz M. Maizels R.M.

All batches (A to D) were derived from experimental infections initiated from different larval stocks established over a period of 2 years from new generations of the same isolate. H. contortus adult worms were harvested from the abomasum of infected donor lambs, washed several times in PBS, and kept in RPMI 1640 medium containing antibiotics (100 IU of penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 5 ॖg/ml gentamicin) at 37 °C under 57 CO2. The parasites were first incubated for 4 h, after which the medium was harvested and new medium containing 27 glucose was added for overnight incubation. The supernatant was collected, centrifuged, filter-sterilized (0.2 ॖm), concentrated, and desalted (10 mm Tris, NaCl pH7.4) in 3-kDa filters (Centripep YM-3, Millipore). Prior to isoelectric focusing, the ESP were precipitated in a final concentration of 107 trichloroacetic acid (dissolved in acetone) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol. The pellet was washed one time in acetone with 10 mm dithiothreitol and resuspended in rehydration solution (7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 47 CHAPS, 27 carrier ampholyte mixture, pH 3–10NL (IPG buffer) and 20 mm dithiothreitol). Isoelectric focusing instrumentation, IPG gels, and related reagents were fromAmersham Biosciences unless otherwise indicated. Either 70 or 140 ॖg of protein was loaded onto 13-cm IPG strips (pH 3–10NL) and supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The sample was rehydrated and focused in an automated overnight run (IPGPhorTM) using 10–14 h of rehydration (30 V), followed by a step voltage focusing procedure (1 h 500 V, 1 h 1000 V followed by 8000 V until a total of 35–40 Kvh was reached). The strips were incubated in 10 ml of equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris, 6m urea, 27 SDS, 307 glycerol, pH 8.8) containing 30 mm dithiothreitol for the first 15 min and replaced by equilibration buffer with 135 mm iodoacetamide for another 15 min. Electrophoresis in second dimension gel SDS-gel was carried out in a Hoefer SE600 system. Silver staining or Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was used to visualize proteins after second dimensional electrophoresis. The images of the gels were acquired using LabScan v3.0 software on an ImageScanner (Amersham Biosciences). ESP of H. contortus were separated in 12.57 SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonP, Millipore) using a semi-dry system (Novablot, Hoefer) in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris, 0.03757 SDS, 207 methanol) at 1.1 mA/cm2 for 1 h. The transfer efficiency was checked by staining of the membranes with DB71 (14Hong H.Y. Yoo G.S. Choi J.K. Electrophoresis. 2000; 21: 841-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked with 57 skimmed milk in PBS/0.057 Tween 20 (PBS-T, 1h, 37 °C) and all the washing steps were done with PBS-T (1 × 15 min, 1 × 10 min, 2 × 5 min). Either a pool of sera from parasite-free animals or a pool of polyclonal sera derived from five sheep hyperimmune to H. contortus (1/500 in PBS-T/27 milk) was incubated overnight at 22–24 °C, washed, and incubated with anti-sheep total IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1/75000 in PBS-T/27 milk) for 1 h at room temperature. The chemiluminescent development was performed with ECL Plus according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Films exposed to the blots were densitometrically scanned using an ImageScanner, and matching was done by comparing the films of the blots with the DB71-stained membrane image and later with the master gel. Proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (Sigma). Before MALDI-TOF analysis, peptides were concentrated using ॖC18-ZipTips (Millipore) and eluted directly on the MALDI-target in 1 ॖl of a saturated solution of α-cyanohydroxycinnamic acid in 507 acetonitrile. Peptides were analyzed using a Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems) operated in reflectron mode at 20 kV accelerating voltage. Tandem MS measurements were performed on an electrospray ionization (ESI) quadrupole time-of-flight instrument (Q-Tof; Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) operating in positive ion mode and equipped with a Z-spray nano-ESI source. Nano-ESI needles were prepared from borosilicate glass capillaries (Kwik-FilTM, World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) on a P-97 puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The needles were coated with a gold layer using an Edwards Scancoat sputter-coater 501 (at 40 mV, 1 kV, for 200 s). The capillary voltage was set at 1500 V; the cone voltage was 40 V. For the characterization of Hc15, the collision energy was optimized for individual peptides for optimal fragmentation. In all other cases, instead of nano-ESI needles a nano-LC system was coupled to the Q-TOF essentially as described in Ref. 15Meiring H.D. van der Heeft E. ten Hove J. de Jong A.P.J.M. J. Sep. Sci. 2002; 25: 557-568Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar. Peptide mixtures were delivered to the system using a Famos autosampler (LCPackings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) at 3 ॖl/min and trapped on an AquaTM C18RP column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA; column dimensions 1 cm × 100 ॖm inner diameter). After flow splitting down to 150–200 nl/min, peptides were transferred to the analytical column (PepMap; LC Packings, Amsterdam, The Netherlands; column dimensions 25 cm × 50 ॖm inner diameter) in a gradient of acetonitrile (17 per min). Fragmentation of eluting peptides was performed in data-dependent mode, and mass spectra were acquired in full-scan mode. For protein identification, Mascot software (www.matrixscience.com) was used for data base searches both for peptide mass fingerprinting and peptide sequence tagging. The scanned images were analyzed with Image Master two-dimensional v4.01 software (Amersham Biosciences). The observed molecular weight and isoelectric points (pI) of all the spots were calculated with protein markers (low molecular weight calibration kit, Amersham Biosciences) and pI markers (two-dimensional SDS-PAGE standards, Bio-Rad). Protein staining and immunological recognition of individual spots were quantified by calculation of spot volume after normalization of the image, using the total spot volume normalization method multiplied by the total area of all the spots (Image Master software). For the immunoblotting analysis, the image of the 2-min exposure was used for the quantification procedures. H. contortusEST sequences available from the dbEST division of GenBankTM (4843 on September 30, 2002) were clustered by SeqMan (Lasergene sequence analysis software, DNAstar) using a minimum match percentage of 90 and a minimum overlap of 20 bp. The alignments of the 342 clusters containing three or more ESTs were edited manually where necessary. The resulting 1876 clusters (of which 1253 contain a single EST) were annotated by running locally a Blastx (NCBI, cut-off p > 100) against the complete SwissProt and Trembl protein data bases. All EST clusters and all separate ESTs were subjected to a six-frame translation, and all peptide sequences longer than 60 amino acids were used for making a local data base that was searched by EMOWSE (16Pappin D.J.C. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar) (available from the EMBOSS package at www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk/Software/EMBOSS). A tolerance of 0 was specified (effectively ± 0.5 dalton), and for cysteines modification by iodoacetamide was taken into account. Under optimized conditions of sample preparation, aiming at the prevention of proteolytic breakdown and limitation of artificial modifications, 224 Coomassie Blue-stained spots were detected in a 140-ॖg sample of H. contortus ESP (Fig.1). This complexity substantially exceeds previous estimations derived from one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and was even more apparent after silver staining, resulting in the automated detection of about 950 spots. Fig. 2shows a comparison of silver-stained gels of four batches of ESP obtained from different infections (see “Discussion”). Five Coomassie Blue-stained gels holding samples of the same batch of ESP were found by imaging software analysis to be nearly identical and were used for the reported experiments.Figure 2Silver-stained two-dimensional-SDS-PAGE gels of H. contortusESP. Four independent batches (70 ॖg) were run on a 12.57 two-dimensional gel (pI 3–10NL) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, batch used for the mass spectrometry procedures (in Fig. 1). B,C, and D, three other independent batches. For comparison, some of the identified spots are marked in all four gels. Molecular mass markers are indicated in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 130 spots were judged to contain sufficient material for fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Fingerprints were used for searching the GenBankTM non-redundant protein data base with Mascot software and allowed the identification of 61 spots of H. contortus origin. Because relatively few H. contortusentries are present in GenBankTM nr, an attempt was made to employ EST data for peptide mass fingerprint searching. H. contortus ESTs were clustered and searched by EMOWSE (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) for matching the fingerprints. The top-score hits identified in 43 cases a contig matching one of the 61 spots identified by Mascot in GenBankTM nr. Additional EMOWSE hits, scoring within the range observed for the 43 confirmed Mascot hits, could represent significant identifications of proteins that are currently only present in the EST-derived data. To check for the reliability of these hits, selected spots were subjected to peptide fragmentation by LC-MS/MS to obtain sequences that could be used for searching both GenBankTM nr and EST data bases. In addition, manual comparison of peptide fingerprints of 12 spots, lacking LC-MS/MS data, revealed a very high similarity to the fingerprints of adjoining spots (marked as “identified by fingerprint similarity” in Supplementary Table S1 that includes all MW, PI, spot volume, and scoring data), which in most cases was confirmed by a matching EMOWSE top hit. These spots could represent post-translationally modified forms of the same protein. In this way, a total of 107 identifications were made from 102 spots, of which 62 were confirmed as top hit by EMOWSE searches of the EST-derived dataset (average score of 0.293, ranging from 0.132 to 0.556). In addition, for 14 spots confirmation by EMOWSE was obtained by lower ranking hits. The fingerprints of 8 spots with high EMOWSE scores (p > 0.250, average 0.345) lacked confirmation by other methods. Confidence in these hits was enhanced by a manual reinspection demonstrating that the fingerprints matched within 50 ppm mass accuracy to the exact calculated MWs of the predicted peptides of their respective EMOWSE hits (EMOWSE tolerates a less accurate MW range of ± 0.5 dalton). They are taken up in the supplementary table as preliminary identifications. In Fig. 3 a colored scheme is used for categorizing identified spots in functional groups. Immunoblotting results are also incorporated. Immunoblotting of two-dimensional gels in combination with sensitive chemiluminescence detection permits quantification of relative immunogenicity (included in Supplementary Table S1) of individual spots by taking the ratio between the density of a Coomassie Blue-stained spot and its chemiluminescence signal. Reproducible blots of ESP batch A were incubated with a pool of hyperimmune sera obtained from five sheep experimentally infected withH. contortus several times. Spots on the blot and the gel were matched by imaging software; the final image is shown in Fig.4. From 193 immune-recognized spots detected by image analysis, 52 have been identified above by mass spectrometry. Relative immunogenicity was observed to vary over a 2500-fold range (comparing spot 182 to spot 170) but is in fact larger because some high-density spots display no immunological detection at all, whereas several immunogenic spots cannot be detected by Coomassie Blue staining. This also reflects the specificity of immune recognition of the respective spots. TableI provides a list of protein identifications; full data can be found in Supplementary Table S1.

Hc15, Hc24, and GA1 are the only proteins that have previously been shown to be ESP constituents (17Schallig H.D.F.H. van Leeuwen M.A.W. Verstrepen B.E. Cornelissen A.W.C.A. Mol. Biochem.

Although for each a single gene has been cloned, we identified multiple spots for each of the three proteins (all of unknown function), hinting at sequence modifications (post-translational or in primary sequence). This was investigated in more detail for the spots identified as Hc15. Mascot and EMOWSE searches of MALDI-TOF fingerprints in combination with manual comparison of the fingerprints from this gel region identified 21 potential Hc15 protein spots distributed over a wide range of pI and MW (pI 5.53–7.04; 16.1–19.0 kDa) as indicated in Fig.3. Tandem mass spectrometry was pursued on these spots until high sequence coverage was obtained. All spots appear to be Hc15-related. In Fig. 5 the single published sequence of Hc15 (AAC47713) is taken as a basis, and all sequenced parts of the individual spots are shaded. Amino acid substitutions, all of which can be explained by single nucleotide changes, are observed in 10 of 21 spots. One to 5 residues are substituted out of a set restricted to 6 positions (Fig. 5, shaded in black) and occur in 9 different combinations. Four of 6 (T46A, R64P, T73A, and V90I) are also observed to be encoded by one or more of the 19 ESTs matching Hc15 and are thus confirmed to be present at the protein level in ESP. Two additional substitutions (H47R and N72S), detected by de novo sequencing using the MS data, were not found in ESTs. Spectra of six spots contained a 1362-Da mass peak, the full sequence (SGNQVMFENINK) of which does not correspond to a tryptic fragment and therefore possibly represents the N terminus (Fig. 5). This N terminus exactly matches the end of an 11-amino acid deletion (between Glu-20 and Gly-30) in three ESTs (BF059795, BF422966, BF423305). Both in these three ESTs and in all other sequences, signal peptide cleavage is predicted to occur after Gly-19 (SignalP). The predicted N-terminal tryptic peptide of AAC47713 (ESQLNTK) and of the other 16 ESTs was not observed in any of the spots, suggesting alternative cleavage at the N terminus at Gly-30. A total of 17 of the 19 available Hc15 ESTs contain the stop codon and, as concluded from an alignment of these EST sequences, the 35-amino acid C-terminal tryptic peptide seems to be the most conserved part of the protein. Thus, spots 188 and 190 on the one hand and spots 161, 162, 165, and 167 on the other hand are almost fully sequenced by MS/MS and predicted to have an identical number of amino acids but, nevertheless, display a ∼2000-Da mass difference. Possibly post-translational modifications are involved in such differences. Collectively, the residue substitutions and alternative N-terminal sequences result in considerable variation among Hc15 proteins. A direct relationship between sequence variation and immune recognition, as measured by the relative immunogenicity described in Fig.6, is far from obvious. Only 2 of the 10 spots in which substitutions have been found are recognized by hyperimmune serum (Fig. 5, spots 177 and 189), and even spots in which no sequence variation is detected by MS/MS display a 5-fold difference in immunogenicity (e.g. spots 180 and 183) or are not detected at all (e.g. prominent spots 175 and 193). Variation in relative immunogenicity is even more pronounced within the groups identified as Hc24-like (9 spots) and GA1-like (21 spots). For the Hc24 group a 32-fold difference was observed (comparing spot 128 to 131), whereas one of nine was not recognized at all (spot 119). Similar to the Hc15 group, spots are distributed over a wide pI and MW range (4.80–6.71; 26.2–34.3 kDa). Spots of the GA1 group are located in a more restricted area (see below) accommodating many other, sometimes co-migrating, spots (more clearly demonstrated after silver staining). This increases fingerprint complexity and might explain the low, but significant, Mascot scores of a number of GA1 identifications (Table S1). In addition, low scores may point at considerable sequence modification between spots and the published GA1 sequence, a feature that can only be clarified by an extensive MS/MS approach as used above for Hc15. GA1 protein is a 92-kDa membrane-associated polyprotein from which p46GA1 and p52GA1 subunits are released into solution after cleavage by glycosylinositol-specific phospholipase C (18J"

The results of recent genetic analysis of rabphilin knock-out animals, however, strongly refute this notion, because there are no obvious genetic interactions between Rab3 and rabphilin in nematoda (Staunton, J., Ganetzky, B., and Nonet, M. L. (2001) J. Neurosci. 21, 9255–9264), suggesting that Rab3 is not a major ligand of rabphilin in vivo. In this study, I tested the interaction of rabphilin, Rim1, Rim2, and Noc2 with 42 different Rab proteins by cotransfection assay and found differences in rabphilin, Rim1, Rim2, and Noc2 binding to several Rab proteins that belong to the Rab functional group III (Rab3A/B/C/D, Rab26, Rab27A/B, and Rab37) and/or VIII (Rab8A and Rab10). Rim1 interacts with Rab3A/B/C/D, Rab10, Rab26, and Rab37; Rim2 interacts with Rab3A/B/C/D and Rab8A; and rabphilin and Noc2 interact with Rab3A/B/C/D, Rab8A, and Rab27A/B. By contrast, the synaptotagmin-like protein homology domain of Slp homologue lacking C2 domains-a (Slac2-a)/melanophilin specifically recognizes Rab27A/B but not other Rabs. I also found that alternative splicing events in the first α-helical region (α1) of the Rab binding domain of Rim1 alter the Rab binding specificity of Rim1. Site-directed mutagenesis and chimeric analyses of Rim2 and Slac2-a indicate that the acidic cluster (Glu-50, Glu-51, and Glu-52) in the α1 region of the Rab binding domain of Rim2, which is not conserved in the synaptotagmin-like pro tein homology domain of Slac2-a, is a critical determinant of Rab3A recognition. Based on these results, I propose that Rim, rabphilin, and Noc2 function differently in concert with functional group III and/or VIII Rab proteins, including Rab3 isoforms.

However, the results of a recent genetic analysis of rabphilin knock-out animals strongly refute this notion, because there are no obvious genetic interactions between Rab3 and rabphilin in neurotransmitter release (13Schluter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M. Tzonopoulos T. Nicoll R.A. Janz R. Malenka R.C. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5834-5846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Staunton J. Ganetzky B. Nonet M.L. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9255-9264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this, Rab3A has been shown to function in exocytosis of endocrine cells independent of rabphilin (15Joberty G. Stabila P.F. Coppola T. Macara I.G. Regazzi R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3579-3587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18113-18120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In addition, an analysis of aCaenorhabditis elegans unc-10 mutant (homologue of vertebrate Rim) has revealed that there is little genetic interaction between Rim and Rab3, indicating that Rim functions as more than just an effector of Rab3 (17Koushika S.P. Richmond J.E. Hadwiger G. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nonet M.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). All of these observations strongly suggest that Rab3A is not a major in vivo binding partner of Rim, rabphilin, and Noc2 and that another unidentified binding protein(s) (possibly other Rab subfamilies) must exist in the body. However, no attempt to identify a genuine ligand of these molecules has ever been made, despite the fact that such information is critical to understanding the different phenotypes in Rim and rabphilin mutant animals at the molecular level. In this study, I examined the Rab binding activities of Rim1, Rim2, Noc2, and rabphilin by cotransfection assay in COS-7 cells using 42 different Rab proteins (including 37 subfamilies reported in the mouse data bases (18Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 19Bock J.B. Matern H.T. Peden A.A. Scheller R.H. Nature. 2001; 409: 839-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar)) and found that these molecules exhibit distinct Rab binding specificity. Rim1, Rim2, Noc2, and rabphilin interact differently with several Rab proteins that belong to the Rab functional group III (Rab3, Rab26, Rab27, and Rab37) and/or VIII (Rab8 and Rab10) (18Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 3), whereas the synaptotagmin-like protein (Slp)1 homology domain (SHD) of Slp homologue lacking C2 domains-a (Slac2-a)/melanophilin specifically recognizes Rab27A/B. I also identified the acidic cluster in the α1 region as a critical determinant of Rab3A recognition by Rim2. These results suggest that Rim, Noc2, and rabphilin are not specific Rab3 effectors and may activate various Rabs differently than previously thought. cDNA encoding an N-terminal Rab binding domain (RBD) of mouse Rim1, Rim2, and Noc2 was amplified from the Marathon-Ready adult brain cDNA (Clontech) by reverse transcriptase-PCR as described previously (20Fukuda M.

Recent Res. Dev. Neurochem. 2002; 5: 297-309Google Scholar). Interestingly, the SHD shows sequence and structural similarities to the Rab3A binding domain of rabphilin (i.e. two α-helical regions separated by Zn2+ finger motifs) (28Fukuda M. Saegusa C. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) (Fig.1, A and B, and Fig. 4A), and Rab27A/B is the closest homologue of Rab3A in the phylogenetic tree (18Pereira-Leal J.B. Seabra M.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Although rabphilin was first proposed to be a Rab3 isoform-specific effector (1Shirataki H.

Actually, there are several Rab proteins that are phylogenetically similar to the Rab3 isoforms (e.g. Rab26, Rab27A/B, and Rab37) and localized on secretory granules, the same as Rab3A (31Yi Z.

As expected, rabphilin strongly interacted with three different Rab species (Rab3A, Rab8A, and Rab27A) and marginally with Rab15, but not with any of the other Rabs tested (Fig. 2B,top panel). By contrast, Slac2-a exclusively interacted with Rab27A and not with any other Rabs, including Rab3A, the closest homologue of Rab27A (Fig. 2C, top panel), consistent with the results of my previous studies (24Kuroda T.S.

We have shown previously that a 5-amino acid β-sheet breaker peptide (iAβ5p), end-protected, has the ability to induce a dramatic reduction in amyloid deposition in two different transgenic Alzheimer's models (Permanne, B., Adessi, C., Saborio, G.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of chemical modifications of the peptide bonds at the metabolite cleavage sites on the pharmacological properties of iAβ5p derivatives. Using a rational approach, peptide analogs were designed and tested for in vitro activity and enzymatic stability. One peptide analog containing a methyl group introduced at the nitrogen atom of one amide bond showed increased stability in vitro, a 10-fold higherin vivo half-life, and good brain uptake compared with iAβ5p while maintaining a similar activity in vitro. Our results suggest that the pharmacological profile of β-sheet breaker peptides can be improved to produce compounds with drug-like properties that might offer a new promise in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease is a degenerative disorder of the brain for which there is no cure or effective treatment.

We proposed that short synthetic peptides capable of binding Aβ but unable to become part of a β-sheet structure (β-sheet breaker peptides) may destabilize the amyloidogenic Aβ conformer and hence preclude amyloid formation (3Soto C.

We reported previously that a 5-residue synthetic peptide (iAβ5, LPFFD) was able to inhibit and disassemble amyloid fibrils in vitro, to prevent Aβ neurotoxicity in cell culture, to arrest deposition of amyloid lesions, and to induce dissolution of preformed plaques in a rat brain model of amyloidosis (4Soto C.

More recently, we showed that iAβ5 with N- and C-terminal protections to minimize exopeptidase cleavage (iAβ5p, Ac-LPFFD-NH2) was rapidly taken up by the brain and reduced in vivo amyloid deposition and cerebral damage in a double transgenic animal model of Alzheimer's disease (11Permanne B.

In addition, this compound showed low toxicity, low immunogenicity, and high solubility. The weakest aspect of this compound is its relatively short in vivo half-life. amyloid-β peptide blood-brain barrier N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography The goal of this work was to introduce a series of chemical modifications into iAβ5p aiming to increase stability and simultaneously maintaining (or enhancing) potency, brain uptake, compound solubility, and low toxicity. A rational lead optimization strategy was followed by identification of the main metabolites of iAβ5p and design modifications at the catabolic sites of the sequence to prevent proteolytic degradation. Peptide analogs were screened by a set of in vitro and in vivo assays to select the most suitable compounds. iAβ5p and compounds in groups A–C were synthesized by Neosystem (Strasbourg, France); compounds 1, 2, and 5–8 in groups D and E were synthesized by Synt:em (Nı̂mes, France). All these compounds were synthesized in solid phase using Fmoc chemistry. Pseudoproline-containing compounds (D3 and D4) were synthesized at the Institute of Organic Chemistry (University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland) using Fmoc solid-phase chemistry as previously described (12Mutter M. Nefzi A. Sato T. Sun X. Wahl F. Wohr T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar). Peptides were purified by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Purity was >95% as estimated by RP-HPLC and mass spectrometric analysis. Tritium-labeled compounds were synthesized by Amersham Biosciences (Buckinghamshire, UK). Labeling was incorporated during the synthesis using a 3,4-dehydroproline residue instead of proline at position 2. The dehydro-peptide was mixed with 10% palladium on calcium carbonate and dimethylformamide in a titration vessel. The mixture was stirred under tritium gas for 3 h. Thereafter, the solution was filtered, and labile tritium was removed by repeated evaporations to dryness with ethanol. The labeled peptide was purified by HPLC, and purity was estimated by mass spectrometry. Labeling at positions 3 and 4 of the Pro ring was considered chemically stable because <5% isotopic exchange with the solvent occurred in a period of 6 months. The specific activity determined by mass spectrometry was 75 Ci/mmol. Tritium radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (Beckman Instruments). Peptides were prepared as a 1 mm solution in phosphate-buffered saline. 20 μl of the peptide solution was diluted in 80 μl of human plasma (freshly taken) or 10% rat brain homogenate (in 1× phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5% Triton X-100). The solution was incubated at 37 °C for different times, and the reaction was stopped by adding the Complete mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). The bulk of the plasma and brain proteins (but none of the peptide) were precipitated in cold methanol (1:4 (v/v) mixture/MeOH) for 1 h at −20 °C. The precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant containing the peptide was concentrated five times under vacuum and separated by RP-HPLC. The area of the peak (UV absorbance at 205 nm) corresponding to the intact peptide was measured and compared with an equivalent sample incubated in phosphate-buffered saline. Amyloid formation was quantitatively evaluated by the fluorescence emission of thioflavin T bound to amyloid fibrils as reported previously (13Soto C. Castaño E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 14LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). Aliquots of Aβ-(1–42) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml prepared in 0.1m Tris (pH 7.4) were incubated under gentle swirling for 5 days at 37 °C in the absence or presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the compounds. At the end of the incubation period, 50 mm glycine (pH 9.2) and 2 μm thioflavin T were added in a final volume of 2 ml. Fluorescence was measured at an excitation of 435 nm and an emission of 485 nm in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Model LS50B fluorescence spectrometer. Aliquots of Aβ-(1–42) at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml prepared in 0.1 m Tris (pH 7.4) were incubated alone or in the presence of different concentrations of the compounds for 36 h at 37 °C under gentle swirling. At the end of the incubation period, an aliquot of the solution was added to the medium of PC12 cells (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fromBIOSOURCE) to reach a final concentration of 5.5 μm Aβ. The cells were incubated for 24 h; and thereafter, the cellular viability was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Mice (CD-1, 28–36 g, in a house colony; Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Saint Louis, MO) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal urethane (40%), and the left jugular vein and the right carotid artery were exposed. 0.2 ml of Ringer's lactate solution (7.19 g/liter NaCl, 0.3 g/liter KCl, 0.28 CaCl2, 2.1 g/liter NaHCO3, 0.16 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.37 g/liter MgCl2·6H2O, 0.99 g/literd-glucose, and 10 g/liter bovine serum albumin (pH 7.4)) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and the tritium-labeled peptide (100,000 cpm/ml) alone or with the unlabeled peptide was injected. Arterial blood was collected from the right carotid artery at different time points following intravenous injection into tubes containing the complete mixture of protease inhibitors. Serum was obtained by centrifugation at 4800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Following arterial blood collection, the mice were decapitated, and the whole brains (except the pineals and pituitaries) were harvested and weighed. The amount of radioactivity in the brain and serum was determined after an overnight solubilization step in TS-2 solution (Research Product International Corp., Mount Prospect, IL) at 40 °C. The brain/serum ratio (μl/g) was estimated by the following equation: brain/serum ratio = (cpm/g of brain)/(cpm/μl of serum). The influx rate (Ki; μl of serum/g of brain/min) represents the rate at which compounds are moving from the circulation into the brain. The volume of distribution (Vi; μl of serum/g of brain) is the apparent volume of material that is distributed to the brain at time 0 and was estimated by extrapolation. The amount of intact peptide contained in blood or brain samples was determined by HPLC analysis. Serum or brain homogenate (10%) containing the complete mixture of protease inhibitors was treated as described above under “In Vitro Assay of Peptide Stability.” To wash out blood from the brains, animals were perfused with 20 ml of Ringer's lactate solution (0.9% NaCl) in the left ventricle of the heart for 30 s. Capillary depletion studies were done as described (15Gutierrez E.G. Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 47: 169-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral cortex was weighted and homogenized in physiological buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mmNaH2PO4, and 10 mmd-glucose (pH 7.4)). Dextran solution (1.6 ml of a 26% solution) was then added to the homogenate. After centrifugation at 5400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, the pellet containing the brain vasculature and the supernatant containing the brain parenchyma were carefully separated, and the level of tritium was counted in each fraction. In vivo pharmacokinetic parameters of iAβ5p were studied in mice by a single intravenous bolus injection of the tritium-labeled peptide into the tail veins. The half-life of the intact peptide determined by HPLC analysis of blood samples was 7 ± 3 min, consistent with the rapid clearance of the compound from the blood, as previously reported in rats (11Permanne B. Adessi C. Saborio G.P. Fraga S. Frossard M.-J. Dewachter I. Van Dorpe J. Banks W.A. Van Leuven F. Soto C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The HPLC analysis of the serum samples showed that the peptide was degraded into three main metabolites (Fig. 1A) with HPLC retention times of 30, 40, and 47 min, respectively. Incubation of iAβ5p with serum in vitro did not show any degradation after 24 h, as previously reported (11Permanne B. Adessi C. Saborio G.P. Fraga S. Frossard M.-J. Dewachter I. Van Dorpe J. Banks W.A. Van Leuven F. Soto C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the same peaks detected in blood after intravenous injection were observed upon incubation of iAβ5p in brain homogenate in vitro for 30 min at 37 °C, indicating that proteolytic degradation in vivo occurred in tissue, but not in blood. Three radioactive peaks named Ma, Mb, and Mc (retention times of 30, 40, and 47 min, respectively) were obtained, plus a fraction (fraction P) with retention identical to that of the intact peptide (retention time of 50 min). Analysis by mass spectrometry of the last fraction confirmed its identity to the intact peptide. Detection of proline-containing metabolites in the fractions of interest was done by precursor ion scanning tandem mass spectrometry. Scans performed using the mass of the immonium fragment ion of proline (m/z 70) allowed the detection of parent ions at m/z 271 and 418 in fractions Mb and Mc. The tandem mass spectra identified the sequences of the metabolites Ac-LP and Ac-LPF in these fractions (Fig.1, B and C). Finally, the retention times of the chemically synthesized metabolites were identical to those of fractions Mb and Mc. Fraction Ma represents a heterogeneous peak that has not been identified. The two major metabolites found corresponded to proteolytic cleavage of the amide bonds between amino acids 2 and 3 (major cleavage) and between residues 3 and 4 (minor cleavage) (Fig.1D). The strategy for lead optimization was to protect the peptide bonds involved in the proteolytic cleavage of the peptide by introducing chemical modifications around them (Fig. 1D). The following five groups of chemical modifications were studied for increased enzymatic stability of the peptide (TableI).Table ISchematic representation of the five groups of iAβ5p analogs studied Open table in a new tab Replacement of the hydrogen attached to the amide nitrogen with an alkyl group was reported to prevent endopeptidase degradation of the peptide bond into which it is incorporated (8Adessi C. Soto C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 16Schaller A. Phytochemistry (Oxf.). 1998; 47: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several combinations of single, double, and triple N-methylations were introduced in the sequence of iAβ5p. Modifications of the α-carbon by replacing the hydrogen with an alkyl group is an approach also reported to decrease protease degradation of the peptide (8Adessi C. Soto C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 17Nagaraj R. Balaram P. FEBS Lett. 1978; 96: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Khosla M.C. Stachowiak K. Smeby R.R. Bumpus F.M. Piriou F. Lintner K. Fermandjian S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A modified peptide was synthesized by adding methyl groups at the α-carbons corresponding to amino acids 3 and 4. Most natural peptides with free N and C termini are degraded rapidly in blood and tissues by nonspecific exopeptidases (6Fauchere J.L. Thurieau C. Adv. Drug Des. 1992; 23: 127-159Google Scholar, 8Adessi C. Soto C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Modification with chemical groups at both the N and C termini results in a lack of recognition by exopeptidases and a dramatic increase in peptide stability. A series of modifications were included at the N terminus of iAβ5p to determine the optimal chemical group for achieving the highest stability, solubility, and activity. One approach for stabilizing a peptide is to modify the side chains of some of the amino acids involved in the protease recognition site. The residues of interest are replaced with non-natural amino acids with chemically similar side chains. The idea is to modify the recognition site of the enzyme to prevent the cleavage while staying as close as possible to the original sequence to preserve the activity of the peptide. In our case, the protease recognition site involves residues 2 and 3. Therefore, a series of modifications of the side chains of Pro and Phe were synthesized. The design of cyclic analogs represents another widely used strategy to increase peptide stability and potency (19Wen J.J. Spatola A.F. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 49: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cyclization confers a structural constraint that reduces conformational flexibility and may enhance potency, selectivity, stability, and bioavailability as well as membrane barrier permeability. To evaluate this approach, a cyclic peptide was synthesized by introducing 1 cysteine at each end and linking them by a disulfide bridge. First, all peptide derivatives were screened for in vitro activity in inhibition of amyloid fibril formation. Fibril formation was quantified with a fluorescence assay based on the specific binding of thioflavin T to β-sheet amyloid aggregates (13Soto C. Castaño E.M. Frangione B. Inestrosa N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3063-3067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar,14LeVine H. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1962) Google Scholar). The results are expressed in Fig. 2as the percent inhibition of fibrillogenesis compared with the activity of the iAβ5p compound (100% activity). The following compounds had >80% activity: iAβ5p-A1, iAβ5p-A4, iAβ5p-A5, iAβ5p-A7, iAβ5p-B1, iAβ5p-C1, iAβ5p-C2, and iAβ5p-C3. This set of compounds was selected for evaluation of resistance to enzymatic degradation in vitro. All compounds in group D (modifications of proline or phenylalanine) and in group E (cyclization) showed dramatically reduced activities (<40% of the activity of iAβ5p). The selected peptide analogs were incubated in vitrowith human plasma or rat brain homogenate to model degradation in blood and tissues, respectively. The results shown in TableII indicate that the most stable compounds are iAβ5p-A1, iAβ5p-A5, iAβ5p-A7, and iAβ5p-B1. These compounds showed very little or no degradation during the 24-h study period (Table II).Table IIIn vitro stability of selected compoundsPeptide analogsStability in human plasmaStability in rat brain homogenateiAβ5p>24 h15 miniAβ5p-A1>24 h>24 hiAβ5p-A4>24 h 5 hiAβ5p-A5>24 h>24 hiAβ5p-A7>24 h>24 hiAβ5p-B1>24 h>24 hiAβ5p-C15 min<1 miniAβ5p-C2 7 h41 miniAβ5p-C3 6 h25 min Open table in a new tab To further reduce the number of compounds to be tested in vivo, we used a cellular model of amyloid-induced cytotoxicity as a second screen for in vitro activity. Toxicity of Aβ in cell culture has been reported to be related to the formation of β-sheet-rich aggregates (20Pike C.J. Burdick D. Walencewicz A.J. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1676-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lorenzo A. Yankner B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 1994; 91: 12243-12247Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar) and has been used to screen diverse compounds to prevent amyloid neurotoxicity. The results from this study indicate that iAβ5p-A1 has similar (or even greater) activity to iAβ5p in preventing amyloid-induced cell death (Fig.3). A 10-residue unrelated peptide that was used as a control was found not to alter Aβ cytotoxicity. As part of our screening studies, we have used many different control peptides, including unrelated peptides of the same length, reverse and scrambled sequences, fragments containing the sequence of Aβ used as the template for iAβ5p, and β-sheet breaker peptides designed to inhibit formation of β-sheet aggregates in other systems (4Soto C. Sigurdsson E.M. Morelli L. Kumar R.A. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 5Soto C. Kindy M.S. Baumann M. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys.

Neurol. 2000; 59: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The results show that none of these peptides exhibit significant inhibitory activity and that even some of them enhance amyloid formation, most likely by incorporation into the aggregates (4Soto C. Sigurdsson E.M. Morelli L. Kumar R.A. Castano E.M. Frangione B. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 822-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 5Soto C. Kindy M.S. Baumann M. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys.

Neurol. 2000; 59: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). iAβ5p-A1 was selected as a prototype of a β-sheet breaker peptide with similar in vitro activity to iAβ5p, but with much higher biological stability. The pharmacokinetic properties and BBB permeability of iAβ5p-A1 were studied in vivo and compared with those of iAβ5p. Fig. 4 shows the results of a pharmacokinetic study done in mice by a single intravenous bolus injection of either iAβ5p or iAβ5p-A1. The latter compound has a 10-fold greater half-life (70 min versus 7 min) and a >70-fold higher area under the curve compared with iAβ5p. The ability of iAβ5p-A1 to cross the BBB was analyzed by brain perfusion of the tritium-labeled peptide. Radioactivity corresponding to the intact peptide was rapidly observed in the brain as analyzed by HPLC. To determine whether the peptide has effectively penetrated into the brain parenchyma, a capillary depletion experiment was performed. 10 min after injection of tritium-labeled peptide, >70% of the radioactivity was recovered in the parenchyma (data not shown). The percent radioactivities associated with the capillary fraction with and without blood washout were 24 and 29%, respectively. This result indicates that the majority of the compound in the brain had effectively crossed the BBB and that the peptide did not bind to the luminal surface of the capillaries and was not greatly sequestrated by the brain endothelial cells. To estimate the amount of compound entering the brain, mice were injected intravenously with the radioactive peptide. The percentage of the injected dose of compound taken up per g of brain was calculated. The maximum radioactivity value was 0.464%, and half of this value was reached 1.4 min after injection (Fig. 5). These data suggest rapid brain uptake of iAβ5p-A1. HPLC analysis of brain samples taken 20 min after the intravenous injection showed that 12% of the radioactivity corresponded to the intact peptide. Therefore, we calculated that >0.06% of the injected compound was recovered intact in the brain within the first 20 min after injection. These data are similar to what was found previously for iAβ5p, for which an average of 0.09% of the injected peptide reached the brain in an intact form (11Permanne B. Adessi C. Saborio G.P. Fraga S. Frossard M.-J. Dewachter I. Van Dorpe J. Banks W.A. Van Leuven F. Soto C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of brain uptake, a mixture of labeled and unlabeled peptide was injected. The brain/serum ratio of total radioactivity was determined between 1 and 120 min of exposure. The influx rate (Ki) with the radioactive peptide alone was 3.54 ± 0.29 μl/g/min, and the volume of distribution (Vi), calculated from the y intercept, was ∼50 μl/g (Table III). Brain uptake was inhibited by injection of unlabeled material. 32 and 52% statistically significant decreases in Ki(p = 0.006) were observed after injection of 10 and 100 μg of nonradioactive peptide/mouse, respectively. This result indicates that iAβ5p-A1 penetrates the brain through a saturable mechanism.Table IIIBrain uptake of iAβ5p-A1Intravenous injectionKiViμl/g/minμl/gLabeled only3.54 ± 0.2950.6 ± 12.4Labeled + unlabeled (10 μg)2.41 ± 0.0251.3 ± 10.6Labeled + unlabeled (100 μg)1.62 ± 0.0238.16 ± 14.8 Open table in a new tab Peptides are amenable to the process of rationale drug development. It is relatively easy to develop peptides with in vitro activity, high selectivity, and low toxicity (22Fauchère J.-L. Adv. Drug Res. 1986; 15: 29-69Google Scholar). However, due to their predisposition for enzymatic degradation, unmodified peptides do not circulate in blood for more than a few minutes (6Fauchere J.L. Thurieau C. Adv. Drug Des. 1992; 23: 127-159Google Scholar). Moreover, they have generally poor bioavailability in tissues and organs, preventing their usefulness as therapeutic agents. Therefore, to use peptides as a drug, they have to be chemically modified so that proteolytic degradation is diminished and bioavailability is increased. The impressive advance in the field of peptide solid- and liquid-phase synthesis allows the introduction of a wide variety of chemical modifications into a peptide backbone (8Adessi C. Soto C. Curr. Med. Chem. 2002; 9: 963-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 23Al Obeidi F. Hruby V.J. Sawyer T.K. Mol. Biotechnol. 1998; 9: 205-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These modifications are useful only if they are strategically introduced to maximize enzymatic stability and bioavailability and simultaneously preserve or enhance potency and selectivity of the bioactive peptide. This approach requires knowledge of the major in vivo proteolytic sites of the peptide and ideally the chemical groups in the molecule responsible for its biological activity (6Fauchere J.L. Thurieau C. Adv. Drug Des. 1992; 23: 127-159Google Scholar, 9Powell M.F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1993; 28: 285-295Google Scholar, 24Degrado W.F. Adv. Protein Chem. 1988; 39: 51-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to analyze and improve the pharmacological properties of a 5-residue β-sheet breaker peptide active in reducing amyloid load and cerebral damage in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. β-Sheet breaker peptides are short synthetic peptides homologous to the central fragment of Aβ containing residues that destabilize β-sheet structures (3Soto C. Mol. Med. Today. 1999; 5: 343-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Sequence similarity is important for the specific interaction of β-sheet breaker peptides with Aβ. The introduction of Pro as a β-sheet blocker residue is important for destabilizing intermolecular β-sheets of Aβ aggregates (12Mutter M. Nefzi A. Sato T. Sun X. Wahl F. Wohr T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wood J.D. Wetzel R. Martin J.D. Hurle M.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 724-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Our approach for lead optimization was to stay as close as possible to the original sequence of iAβ5p to preserve activity and selectivity, introducing only strategic chemical modifications to protect the peptide against proteolytic degradation. Two major cleavage sites were found to be located at the peptide bonds between Pro and Phe and between the two phenylalanines. Interestingly, these amino acid sequences are known to be recognition sites for proteolytic degradation of some endogenous neuropeptides such as bradykinin and substance P (6Fauchere J.L. Thurieau C. Adv. Drug Des. 1992; 23: 127-159Google Scholar, 26Murphey L.J. Hachey D.L. Oates J.A. Morrow J.D. Brown N.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 294: 263-269PubMed Google Scholar) by peptidases such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV, endopeptidase-24.11, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (27Murphey L.J. Gainer J.V. Vaughan D.E. Brown N.J. Circulation. 2000; 102: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 28Matsas R. Kenny A.J. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that phenelzine, an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme, reduced the kinetics of iAβ5p degradation in vitro in rat brain homogenate (data not shown). In addition, several endo- and exopeptidases are specific for cleavage of peptides after Pro (29Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 30Walter R. Simmons W.H. Yoshimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1980; 30: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and it has been proposed that this is critical in controlling the turnover of important proteins containing Pro-rich domains (29Cunningham D.F. O'Connor B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1343: 160-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that these endopeptidases found in plasma membranes of a variety of cells, including brain (31Matsas R. Kenny A.J. Neuroscience. 1989; 31: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), may be responsible for the degradation of iAβ5pin vivo. Chemical modifications such as methylations of the amide bond nitrogen and of the α-carbon introduced at the cleavage sites of iAβ5p improved significantly the enzymatic stability of these analogs in rat brain homogenate. The major protective effect was observed when these modifications were introduced at the peptide bond between Pro and Phe, supporting the finding that this is the major cleavage site of iAβ5p. Some of these compounds, including iAβ5p-A1 (singleN-methylation between Pro and Phe), were similarly or even more active than the unmodified peptide in both the fibrillogenesis and cellular toxicity assays. Interestingly, it has been shown that short Aβ fragments around sequence 16–21 andN-methylated at alternate positions are able to inhibit amyloid fibril formation in vitro (32Gordon D.J. Sciarretta K.L. Meredith S.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8237-8245Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the compound containing a double methylation at the α-carbons (iAβ5p-B1) was active in the fibrillogenesis assay, but less active in the cellular toxicity assay. The reason for this result is under investigation. Although chemical modification at the amide backbone resulted in some active compounds, the replacement of Pro and Phe with non-natural derivatives dramatically decreased activity in vitro in all derivatives. These results suggest that Pro and Phe at positions 2 and 3, respectively, play a fundamental role in the activity of β-sheet breaker peptides. It has been shown previously by several groups that Aβ sequence 17–21 and in particular Phe19 (equivalent to Phe3 of iAβ5p) are critical for Aβ-Aβ interaction and amyloid formation (13Soto C.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8545-8548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). It is likely that the phenylalanines (positions 3 and 4) and leucine (position 1) are responsible for selective binding of the β-sheet breaker peptides to Aβ. On the other hand, the Pro residue does not seem to play a role in binding, but it is critical for activity. Indeed, replacement of Pro with non-β-sheet blocker amino acids such as alanine and valine did not decrease binding of iAβ5p to Aβ, but dramatically reduced the ability of the compound to inhibit amyloid formation in vitro (data not shown). Pro acts as a β-sheet blocker due to its constraint to fold in a β-sheet structure (12Mutter M. Nefzi A. Sato T. Sun X. Wahl F. Wohr T. Pept. Res. 1995; 8: 145-153PubMed Google Scholar, 25Wood J.D.

Proteins. 1995; 22: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). These results suggest the importance of maintaining a key balance between sequence homology of Aβ and the β-sheet breaker peptide and the presence of amino acids able to disrupt β-sheet folding. Complete sequence homology produces a compound with the highest affinity for Aβ, but which is unable to structurally destabilize β-sheets and thus becomes incorporated into amyloid aggregates. Compounds with too many β-sheet blockers have a reduced affinity for Aβ and hence lower potency. A unique characteristic of Pro is its ability to interconvert betweencis- and trans-configurations (36Mutter M. Wohr T. Gioria S. Keller M. Biopolymers. 1999; 51: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 37Sugawara M. Tonan K. Ikawa S. Spectrochim. Acta Part A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc. 2001; 57: 1305-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To evaluate the influence ofcis/trans-switching on the activity of β-sheet breaker peptides, we synthesized derivatives containing pseudoprolines in place of Pro. Pseudoprolines were shown to enhance the Pro features by stabilizing the cis-form of the peptide (36Mutter M. Wohr T. Gioria S. Keller M. Biopolymers. 1999; 51: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, depending on the chemical groups attached to the pseudoproline ring, it is possible to generate compounds with different cis/trans ratios (36Mutter M. Wohr T. Gioria S. Keller M. Biopolymers. 1999; 51: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The results obtained with the two pseudoproline-containing peptides (iAβ5p-D3 and iAβ5p-D4) indicate that stabilization of thecis-configuration decreased the activity of the peptide, suggesting that Pro in the trans-conformation is required for activity. An alternative possibility is that cis-Pro is the active conformation, but that trans-Pro is required for binding to the target. The latter possibility suggests that conformational flexibility of β-sheet breaker peptides might be important for activity. More studies are necessary to investigate these possibilities. A critical requirement for the use of β-sheet breaker peptides in the treatment of amyloidosis in Alzheimer's disease is their ability to enter the brain. We had already reported evidence for high penetration of iAβ5p across the BBB (11Permanne B. Adessi C. Saborio G.P. Fraga S. Frossard M.-J. Dewachter I. Van Dorpe J. Banks W.A. Van Leuven F. Soto C. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 860-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Brain uptake of iAβ5p-A1 is similar to that previously shown for iAβ5p. The percentage of intact iAβ5p-A1 crossing the BBB is in the range of substances known to exert an effect in the brain such as interleukin-1 and morphine (0.08 and 0.02%, respectively) (38Banks W.A. Kastin A.J. Rev. Neurosci. 1993; 4: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and certainly in the upper range of permeability expected for peptide molecules (from 0.01 to 0.1%). Our results indicate that iAβ5p-A1 crosses the BBB by a saturable mechanism, most likely a receptor-mediated transport. At present, the endogenous ligand of the transporter and the nature of the receptor are unknown. In conclusion, our results suggest that the pharmacological profile of peptides can be improved and that application of some of these strategies to β-sheet breaker peptides might result in compounds useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

https://openalex.org/W2123427293,Population codes in the brain have generally been characterized by recording responses from one neuron at a time. This approach will miss codes that rely on concerted patterns of action potentials from many cells. Here we analyze visual signaling in populations of ganglion cells recorded from the isolated salamander retina. These neurons tend to fire synchronously far more frequently than expected by chance. We present an efficient algorithm to identify what groups of cells cooperate in this way. Such groups can include up to seven or more neurons and may account for more than 50% of all the spikes recorded from the retina. These firing patterns represent specific messages about the visual stimulus that differ significantly from what one would derive by single-cell analysis.

Tanaka Y. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the effects of a series of glycolytic genes on the degradation of ptsG mRNA and how the mutations destabilize the ptsG mRNA. The conditional lethal mutation ts8 in fda, encoding fructose-1,6-P2 aldolase just downstream ofpfkA in the glycolytic pathway, caused the destabilization of ptsG mRNA at the nonpermissive temperature. Mutations in any other gene did not destabilize the ptsGmRNA; rather, they reduced the ptsG transcription mainly by affecting the cAMP level. The rapid degradation ofptsG mRNA in mutant strains was completely dependent upon the presence of glucose or any one of its compounds, which enter the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway before the block points. A significant increase in the intracellular glucose-6-P level was observed in the presence of glucose in the pgi strain. An overexpression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase eliminated both the accumulation and the degradation of ptsG mRNA in the pgi strain. In addition, accumulation of fructose-6-P led to the rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA in a pgi pfkA mutant strain lacking glucose-6-P. We conclude that the RNase E-dependent destabilization ofptsG mRNA occurs in response to accumulation of glucose-6-P or fructose-6-P.

In either case, the incorporated sugars are metabolized primarily by the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway and by the pentose phosphate pathway to produce numerous intermediary metabolites as well as energy in cells (5Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 189-198Google Scholar). The PTS in Escherichia coli consists of two common cytoplasmic proteins, enzyme I and HPr (histidine-containing protein of the PTS), as well as an array of sugar-specific enzyme II complexes (EIIs). The glucose-specific EII (glucose transporter) consists of cytoplasmic protein IIAGlc and membrane receptor IICBGlcencoded by crr and ptsG, respectively. The phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate is transferred sequentially to enzyme I, HPr, the EIIs, and finally glucose as it is translocated across the membrane. In addition to sugar transport and phosphorylation, the PTS plays important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular activities. This is particularly evident for the glucose-specific PTS. For example, IIAGlc regulates both the transport of non-PTS sugars and the activity of adenylate cyclase depending on its phosphorylation state (2Meadow N.D. Fox D.K. Roseman S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 497-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 3Postma P.W. Lengeler J.W. Jacobson G.R. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology.

The former process, called inducer exclusion, is fully responsible for the glucose-lactose diauxie that is a prototype of catabolite repression (6Inada T. Kimata K. Aiba H.

A. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A striking recent discovery regarding the regulatory function of PTS is that IICBGlc, depending on its phosphorylation state, interacts with Mlc to modulate the cellular localization and activity of this global repressor protein (8Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Lee S.J. Boos W. Bouche J.P. Plumbridge J.

The expression of the ptsG gene encoding IICBGlcis regulated by two global control systems at the level of transcription initiation (7Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

First, it is under positive control by CRP-cAMP; hence, the ptsG expression is absolutely dependent on this complex. Second, the transcription of theptsG gene is negatively regulated by a global repressor, Mlc. Recent studies have established that external glucose inducesptsG transcription by modulating the Mlc-mediated regulatory pathway (7Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

When glucose is transported into the cell, IICBGlc is dephosphorylated and binds Mlc, resulting in the sequestration of Mlc at the membrane (8Tanaka Y. Kimata K. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5344-5352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 9Lee S.J. Boos W. Bouche J.P. Plumbridge J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5353-5361Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 10Nam T.W.

Another unexpected discovery regarding the regulation of ptsG expression is that a mutation in either pgi or pfkA, encoding glycolytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase or phosphofructokinase A, respectively, leads to a rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA and that RNase E is responsible for the degradation of ptsGmRNA (1Kimata K. Tanaka Y. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, ptsG expression also is regulated at the level of mRNA degradation, presumably in response to the glycolytic flux. However, it remains unclear how the glycolytic flux is involved in the destabilization of ptsG mRNA, and little is known about the mechanism of the stimulation of ptsG mRNA degradation except that RNase E is a major player in this process. In this study, we first investigated whether mutations in glycolytic genes other than pgi and pfkA affect the stability of ptsG mRNA. We found that the conditional lethal mutation ts8 in fda, encoding fructose-1,6-P2 aldolase (Fda) (13Singer M. Rossmiessl P. Cali B.M. Liebke H. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6242-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stimulates degradation of ptsG mRNA but that mutations in any other glycolytic gene did not affect ptsG mRNA degradation. Then we addressed the question of how the mutations destabilize ptsGmRNA. The degradation of ptsG mRNA in mutant cells occurred only in the presence of glucose or any one of the glycolytic intermediates upstream of the block. More specifically, the degradation of ptsG mRNA was associated with elevated levels of glucose-6-P and/or fructose-6-P. We propose that accumulation of glucose-6-P or fructose-6-P is responsible for ptsGmRNA degradation. The physiological relevance of this novel feedback regulatory system at the post-transcriptional step is discussed below. The bacterial strains used in this study are listed in TableI. A series of disruption mutants were constructed by the one-step gene inactivation protocol that is based on the high efficiency of the phage λ Red recombinase (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). The FLP recognition target-flanked resistance gene was eliminated by using an FLP expression plasmid, pCP20 (14Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11304) Google Scholar). To transfer the ts8 fda allele to other backgrounds by P1 phage, the catgene was inserted 2.7 kb downstream of the chromosomal ts8 fda gene in CAG417. IT1568 carrying a frameshift mutation in themlc gene was isolated spontaneously. The zwf gene including the promoter region was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CCCAAGCTTGTGCCGCACTTTGCGCGCT-3′ and 5′-CCCAAGCTTGGCCTGTAACCGGAGCTCA-3′. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with HindIII and cloned intoHindIII-digested pBR322 to construct plasmid pTM6. Cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium or TB medium (15Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) supplemented with kanamycin (15 μg/ml), tetracycline (15 μg/ml), chloramphenicol (15 μg/ml), and/or ampicillin (50 μg/ml) when needed. Bacterial growth was monitored by determining the optical density at 600 nm.Table IBacterial strains used in this studyStrainRelevant genotypeSourceW3110Wild typeLaboratory stockTM54W3110Δpgi::catThis studyCAG417CSH57A fda ts8C.

Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNAs were resolved by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of formaldehyde and blotted onto a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) as described (17Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 202-203Google Scholar). The mRNAs were visualized using digoxigenin reagents and kits for nonradioactive nucleic acid labeling and detection systems (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the procedure specified by the manufacturer. The 305-bp digoxigenin-labeled DNA probe corresponding to the 5′-ptsG region was used. Bacterial cells were grown in LB medium to A 600 = 0.6. Two milliliters of the culture were taken and centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 s at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in 40 μl of 5 mm NaCl and immediately heated at 100 °C for 5 min. After adding 160 μl of ethanol, the mixture was chilled at −70 °C for 30 min and centrifuged at 14,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was dried up, dissolved in 20 μl of H2O, and used for cAMP assay. The determination of cAMP by gel mobility shift assay has been described previously (18Inada T. Takahashi H. Mizuno T. Aiba H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 253: 198-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The cellular concentration of cAMP was calculated on the assumption that an A 600 of 1.4 corresponds to 109 cells/ml (15Miller J. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 433Google Scholar) and that the volume of a cell is 2 × 10−12 ml (19Joseph E. Bernsley C. Guiso N. Ullmann A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1982; 185: 262-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells were grown in LB medium toA 600 = 0.6 unless otherwise specified. One milliliter of the culture was centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 2 min at room temperature. The pellet was suspended in 100 μl of H2O, immediately added to 50 μl of 5 m HClO4, and chilled on ice. After adding 100 μl of 2.5 m K2CO3, the mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was used for the glucose-6-P assay. The assay was performed according to the method of Hogema et al. (20Hogema B.M. Arents J.C. Bader R. Postma P.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1825-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The intracellular concentration of glucose-6-P was calculated as in the case of the cAMP assay. Among glycolytic genes other thanpgi and pfkA, we first focused on fda, which encodes Fda just downstream of pfkA in the Embden-Meyerhof glycolytic pathway (Fig.1). It is known that the Fda activity in a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive fda allele (ts8 or h8) was essentially undetectable at 42 °C (13Singer M. Rossmiessl P. Cali B.M. Liebke H. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6242-6248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ts8 mutation was shown to inhibit stable RNA synthesis and cell growth depending on glucose metabolism at the nonpermissive temperature (21Singer M. Walter W.A. Cali B.M. Rouviere P. Liebke H.H. Gourse R.L. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6249-6257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether the ts8mutation affects the expression and/or degradation of ptsGmRNA, the ts8 allele was transferred to a W3110 background, and the expression of ptsG mRNA in the presence of glucose was analyzed by Northern blotting using aptsG DNA probe. The full-length ptsG mRNA was expressed stably in the ts8 fda strain at 30 °C as in the wild-type strain, whereas the pgi mutation dramatically reduced the full-length ptsG mRNA, resulting in an extensive smear because of the stimulation of RNase E-mediated mRNA degradation (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3). When the temperature was shifted to 42 °C, the ts8 fda strain gave a smear of degradation intermediates ofptsG mRNA (Fig. 2, lane 4), whereas the temperature upshift to 42 °C did not affect the Northern pattern in the wild-type and pgi strains (data not shown). This implies that the loss of Fda activity leads to the rapid degradation ofptsG mRNA in the presence of glucose. The introduction of an rne allele, ams1 (22Kuwano M. Ono M. Endo H. Hori K. Nakamura K. Hirota Y. Ohnishi Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1977; 154: 279-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 23Wachi M. Umitsuki G. Nagai K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), encoding a temperature-sensitive RNase E into the ts8 fda mutant prevented the rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 2, lane 5). Thus, theptsG mRNA is destabilized in an RNase E-dependent manner in the ts8 fda strain at 42 °C as in the case of the pgi and pfkAstrains (1Kimata K. Tanaka Y. Inada T. Aiba H. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3587-3595Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar).Figure 2Effects of mutations in glycolytic genes on the expression of ptsG mRNA.

In the case of TM191 (lanes 3 and 4) and TM234 (lane 5), cells were grown in LB medium with 1% glucose at 30 °C to A 600 = 0.5, and the temperature was shifted to 42 °C (lanes 4 and5) or kept at 30 °C (lane 3).

WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the effects of mutations in other glycolytic genes on the degradation of ptsG mRNA, a series of deletion mutants of glycolytic genes downstream of fda were constructed. We successfully disrupted tpiA, pgk, gpm, andpyk encoding triose-phosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase, phosphoglycerate mutase, and pyruvate kinase, respectively, although we failed to disrupt gap andeno encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and enolase, respectively. The ptsG mRNA expression in each mutant was analyzed by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 2, each of these mutations affected the expression of ptsG mRNA to various extents. However, the Northern patterns of the ptsGmRNA in these mutant strains were essentially the same as those of the wild-type, indicating that these mutations do not affect significantly the degradation of ptsG mRNA (Fig. 2,lanes 6–9). We conclude that mutational blocks only in early stages of the glycolytic pathway produce a signal that leads to the rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA. The effects of mutations in the glycolytic genes on ptsG expression also were analyzed by Western blotting. The level of IICBGlc was correlated with that of the full-length ptsG mRNA in each strain (data not shown). It is likely that the mutations in the glycolytic genes downstream of fda reduce theptsG expression at the level of transcription initiation presumably by affecting the CRP-cAMP and/or Mlc pathways becauseptsG transcription is regulated by these two global systems (7Kimata K. Takahashi H. Inada T. Postma P. Aiba H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12914-12919Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 11Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol.

However, the introduction of the mlc mutation did not affect the ptsG mRNA level in each mutant strain in the presence of glucose, suggesting that the Mlc pathway is not involved in the reduction of ptsG expression (data not shown). We then determined the intracellular cAMP levels in each mutant strain both in the presence and absence of glucose. We observed that the reduction in the intracellular cAMP level by glucose was more significant in the tpiA, gpm, and pykstrains than in the wild-type strain (TableII). Thus, the reduced expression ofptsG mRNA in the tpiA, gpm, andpyk strains particularly in the presence of glucose appears to be at least in part due to the reduction of the intracellular cAMP level. It remains to be studied why ptsG expression is reduced in the pgk strain, in which no significant reduction of cAMP was observed.Table IIIntracellular cAMP levels in exponentially growing cellsStrainGenotypeIntracellular cAMP−Glucose+GlucoseμmμmW3110Wild type5.0 ± 0.62.0 ± 0.2TM54Δpgi4.7 ± 1.03.6 ± 0.1TM84ΔtpiA3.6 ± 0.40.7 ± 0.1TM61Δpgk5.5 ± 0.82.6 ± 0.6TM81ΔgpmAΔgpmB4.5 ± 0.31.4 ± 0.2TM154ΔpykAΔpykF3.5 ± 0.50.7 ± 0.2Intracellular cAMP levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the average of three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Intracellular cAMP levels were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the average of three independent experiments. The ptsG mRNA is highly expressed in the mlc strain without the addition of glucose to the medium, and the ptsG mRNA expression is moderately reduced in the presence of external glucose because of the reduction in cAMP and CRP levels (11Kimata K. Inada T. Tagami H. Aiba H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1509-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When the ptsGmRNA was analyzed in the pgi mlc double mutant growing in LB medium, rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA occurred in the presence of external glucose as expected (Fig.3, lane 4). However, a significant degradation of ptsG mRNA also was observed even without the addition of external glucose (Fig. 3, lane 3). This raises a question as to whether the rapid degradation ofptsG mRNA is dependent upon glucose metabolism. To test this, we introduced the ptsI mutation into thepgi mlc strain and examined the expression ofptsG mRNA by Northern blotting. The ptsGmRNA was stabilized in the pgi mlc ptsI triple mutant where the uptake of glucose is prevented (Fig. 3, lanes 5and 6). It is apparent that the degradation ofptsG mRNA observed in the pgi mlc double mutant growing in LB medium without external glucose was due to trace amounts of endogenous glucose in the LB medium. In fact, the rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA no longer occurred in themlc pgi and mlc pfkA double mutant strains without the addition of glucose when TB medium was used (Fig.4, A and B,lane 1). The addition of glucose caused a dramatic degradation of ptsG mRNA in both strains growing on TB medium (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 2). These results clearly indicate that the destabilization ofptsG mRNA in mutant strains occurs depending on the glucose uptake and metabolism.Figure 4Effects of various carbon sources on the degradation of ptsG mRNA. TM162 (A) and IT1165 (B) were grown in TB medium with and without 0.1% compounds indicated to A 600 = 0.6. Cellular RNAs were prepared, and 15 μg of each of the RNA samples was subjected to Northern blot analysis. The compounds used are glucose (Glc), lactose (Lac), mannitol (Mtl), xylose (Xyl), fructose (Fru), glycerol (Gly), glucose-6-P (G6P), and fructose-6-P (F6P).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether glucose generated internally also could lead to the destabilization ofptsG mRNA in the mutant strains, the effect of the addition of lactose on the degradation of ptsG mRNA was examined. The addition of lactose in the culture medium stimulated the degradation of ptsG mRNA in both the pgi mlcand pfkA mlc strains (Fig. 4, A and B,lane 3). Thus, internally produced glucose, which is believed to be phosphorylated by glucokinase encoded by glk(5Fraenkel D.G. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 189-198Google Scholar), also leads to the destabilization of ptsG mRNA in the mutant strains. We also examined the effect of the addition of several glycolytic intermediates and/or carbon sources on theptsG mRNA degradation in pgi mlc andpfkA mlc double mutant strains. The addition of glucose-6-P, which is taken up by UhpT (24Ambudkar S.V. Anantharam V. Maloney P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12287-12292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), caused the rapid degradation ofptsG mRNA in both strains (Fig. 4, A andB, lane 8). On the other hand, the addition of fructose-6-P, which also is taken up by UhpT, failed to cause the rapid degradation of ptsG mRNA in the pgi mlcstrain (Fig. 4 A, lane 9), although it caused the degradation of ptsG mRNA in the pfkA mlcstrain (Fig. 4 B, lane 9). The addition of mannitol and xylose, which are taken up by mannitol-specific PTS and non-PTS xylose permease, respectively (25Lin E.C.C. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 307-342Google Scholar), and then converted to fructose-6-P, also caused the rapid degradation of ptsGmRNA in the pfkA mlc (Fig. 4 B, lanes 4 and 5) but not in the pgi mlc (Fig.4 A, lanes 4 and 5) strains. However, the addition of fructose, which enters the Embden-Meyerhof pathway past fructose-6-P, did not affect the stability of ptsG mRNA in either strain (Fig. 4, A and B, lane 6). Likewise, the stability of ptsG mRNA in mutant strains was not affected by the addition of glycerol (Fig. 4,A and B, lane 7), which also enters the central carbon metabolism past fructose-1,6-P2. We conclude that the mutational block in the glycolytic pathway destabilizes ptsG mRNA depending on the accumulation of glycolytic intermediates up to the block points. Among glycolytic intermediates, glucose-6-P would be the most likely participant in the destabilization ofptsG mRNA because this intermediate is expected to accumulate at least in the pgi strain growing in the glucose medium. In fact, it is known that the glucose-6-P level in thepgi strain markedly increases when grown in the presence of glucose (26Levi B. Werman M.J. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2001; 12: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Lee A.T. Cerami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8311-8314Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To examine a link between the glucose-6-P level and the destabilization of ptsG mRNA, we determined the intracellular levels of glucose-6-P in various strains growing in LB medium containing exogenous glucose. The glucose-6-P level in thepgi strain was about 8 times higher than that in the wild-type strain (Table III, lines 1 and 2). A moderate but still significant accumulation of glucose-6-P was observed in the pfkA strain (Table III, line 3). On the other hand, little or no increase in the glucose-6-P level was observed in other mutant strains (Table III, lines 4–7). A large increase in the glucose-6-P level was observed in the mlc pgi but not in the mlc and the mlc pgi ptsI strains when cells were grown in LB medium with exogenous glucose (TableIV, lines 2, 4, and 8). As expected, the accumulation of glucose-6-P in the mlc pgi strain occurred even when cells were grown in LB medium without exogenous glucose because of trace amounts of glucose in the medium (Table IV, line 3). However, no increase in the glucose-6-P level was observed in thepgi strain when cells were grown in TB medium without exogenous glucose (Table IV, line 5). All of these results are entirely consistent with a view that accumulation of glucose-6-P is a degradation signal for the ptsG mRNA at least in thepgi strain.Table IIIIntracellular levels of glucose 6-phosphateStrainGenotypeGlucose 6-PmmW3110Wild type1.7 ± 0.4TM54Δpgi13.6 ± 1.1TM238pfkA3.4 ± 0.3TM84ΔtpiA2.0 ± 0.4TM61Δpgk1.7 ± 0.5TM81ΔgpmA ΔgpmB1.9 ± 0.6TM154ΔpykAΔpykF2.7 ± 0.8Cells were grown in LB medium containing 1% glucose.

By generating mice defective in m53BP1(m53BP1tr/tr), we have created an animal model to further explore its biochemical and genetic roles in vivo. We find that m53BP1tr/tr animals are growth-retarded and show various immune deficiencies including a specific reduction in thymus size and T cell count. Consistent with a role in responding to DNA damage, we find thatm53BP1tr/tr mice are sensitive to ionizing radiation (γ-IR), and cells from these animals exhibit chromosomal abnormalities consistent with defects in DNA repair. Thus, 53BP1 is a critical element in the DNA damage response and plays an integral role in maintaining genomic stability."
https://openalex.org/W2109652937,"Acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol transferase (MGAT) plays a predominant role in dietary fat absorption in the small intestine, where it catalyzes the first step of triacylglycerol resynthesis in enterocytes for chylomicron formation and secretion. Although the mouse small intestine exhibits the highest MGAT enzyme activity among all of the tissues studied, the gene encoding the enzyme has not been identified so far. In the present studies, we report the identification and characterization of a mouse intestinal MGAT, MGAT2. Transient expression of MGAT2 in AV-12, COS-7, and Caco-2 cells led to a more than 70-, 30-, and 35-fold increase in the synthesis of diacylglycerol, respectively. MGAT2 expressed in mammalian cells can catalyze the acylation of rac-1-, sn-2-, andsn-3-monoacylglycerols, and the enzyme prefers monoacylglycerols containing unsaturated fatty acyls as substrates. MGAT2 also demonstrates weak DGAT activity, which can be distinguished from its MGAT activity by detergent treatment that abolishes DGAT but not MGAT activity. We also analyzed the biochemical features of MGAT2 and demonstrated homogenate protein-, time-, and substrate concentration-dependent MGAT enzyme activity in transiently transfected COS-7 cells.

When total energy input is in excess of energy output, most excess calories are stored as triacylglycerol and deposited into adipose tissue. The excess storage of triacylglycerol in fat tissues causes obesity. There are two major sources of triacylglycerol syntheses. One is the endogenous pathway where triacylglycerol is resynthesized from circulating free fatty acids, and the other is from dietary fat absorption. The latter becomes a major contributing factor for the ongoing epidemic of obesity in people who consume western diets with high fat content. In mammals, the intestine plays a predominant role in fat absorption (1Phan C.T. Tso P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Mansbach 2nd, C.M. Nevin P. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 963-968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutral fat or triacylglycerol is emulsified to fine lipid droplets and further enzymatically digested to monoacylglycerol and fatty acids, mainly by pancreatic lipase and its cofactor. Facilitated by bile salts, the produced monoacylglycerol and fatty acids are up-taken by enterocytes (3Westergaard H. Dietschy J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1976; 58: 97-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), where they are used to resynthesize triacylglycerol allowing for lipids to be transported into the circulation system (1Phan C.T. Tso P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol is a precursor for phospholipids and triacylglycerol synthesis, which play important roles in cellular signal transduction (4Ron D. Kazanietz M.G.

Coleman R.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 459-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar, 6Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The glycerol phosphate pathway is present in almost all tissues (6Lehner R. Kuksis A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1996; 35: 169-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). During fat absorption by intestine, the monoacylglycerol pathway is the major route of diacylglycerol resynthesis because of the high influx of monoacylglycerol from breakdown of dietary triacylglycerol (9Coleman R.A. Haynes E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 224-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the intestinal enterocytes, the resynthesis of triacylglycerol is predominantly catalyzed by two types of enzymes: acyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) 1The abbreviations used are: MGATacyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferasemMGATmurine MGATDGATacyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferasehDGAThuman DGAT1The abbreviations used are: MGATacyl-CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferasemMGATmurine MGATDGATacyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferasehDGAThuman DGAT and acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT). Sequentially, MGAT catalyzes the joining of monoacylglycerol and fatty acyl-CoAs to form diacylglycerol, whereas DGAT catalyzes the final reaction in which fatty acyl-CoAs are covalently joined to diacylglycerol, producing triacylglycerol (10Coleman R.A.

These works also provide valuable molecular probes to further explore additional enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. A gene encoding MGAT1 was recently identified in mice where expression of MGAT1 was detected in the stomach, kidney, white and brown adipose tissue, and liver (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However, expression of MGAT1 was not detected in small intestine, where high levels of MGAT activity had been observed (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In the present study, we identified and characterized a mouse intestinal MGAT gene (MGAT2) that is most abundantly expressed in small intestine. The murine MGAT2 demonstrates a strong MGAT activity and a weak DGAT activity, with the latter being sensitive to inactivation with detergent. A cDNA clone was identified in NCBI databases based on sequence homology to the known mouse MGAT1. According to flanking cDNA ends, primer pairs were designed to amplify the full-length coding region of MGAT2 from Marathon-Ready cDNA prepared from mouse small intestine (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Amplification was performed by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), resulting in a ∼1.1-kb cDNA product. The PCR product was cloned into the pPCR-script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene) and sequenced. A mammalian expression plasmid coding full-length mouse MGAT2 was engineered by unidirectional subcloning of the 1.1-kb cDNA fragment from the pPCR-script Amp SK(+) vector described above into the NotI and HindIII sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro(−) mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Transient transfection was performed on AV-12, COS-7, or Caco-2 cell lines using the mouse MGAT2 expression plasmids. Cells were maintained under the conditions recommended by the ATCC (Manassas, VA). A day before transfection, 2–4 million cells were subcultured into 20 × 150-mm plates, resulting in ∼70% confluence. Cells were transfected with 15 μg of DNA with the Fugene 6 mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted by centrifugation, lysed, and assayed immediately or frozen in liquid N2 for later use. Cell pellets were homogenized in 20 mm NaCl with three short 10-s pulses from a Brinkmann Instruments Polytron homogenizer. The resultant homogenates were used to assess the activity of MGAT and DGAT in transfected mammalian cells. The protein concentration in homogenates was determined by a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MGAT and DGAT activity was determined at room temperature in a final volume of 200 μl as previously described (14Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C.

Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Briefly, MGAT activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of [14C]oleoyl moiety into dioleoylglycerol with [14C]oleoyl-CoA (American Radiolabeled Chemical Inc., St. Louis, MO) and acyl acceptors (rac-1-oleoylglycerol, sn-2-oleoylglycerol,rac-1-stearoylglycerol, andsn-3-stearoylglycerol). The incorporation of the [14C]oleoyl moiety into trioleoylglycerol with [14C]oleoyl-CoA and sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol was measured to obtain DGAT activity. The acyl acceptors were introduced into the reaction mixture by liposomes. Briefly, acyl acceptors and phosphatidylcholine (molar ratio 1:5) were dissolved in chloroform and dried by vacuum. Liposomes were formed by adding water and shaking for 1 min. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin free fatty acids (Sigma), 200 mmsucrose, 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA (50 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals), 200 μm acyl acceptors in liposomes, and various amounts of cellular homogenate. Unless indicated elsewhere, these experimental conditions were used throughout the study. The reaction was initiated by adding protein homogenate and terminated by adding 4 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) after predetermined incubation periods. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) by vortexing for 30 s. After centrifugation to remove debris, aliquots of the organic phase containing lipids were dried under a N2 stream and separated by the Linear-K Preadsorbent TLC plate (Waterman Inc., Clifton, NJ) with hexane/ethyl ether/acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v/v). The separation was always performed under the conditions wheresn-1,2(2,3)- and sn-1,3-diacylglycerols were clearly resolved. Individual lipid moieties were identified by standards with exposure to I2 vapor. The TLC plates were exposed to x-ray film or a phosphor screen to assess the incorporation of 14C-labeled acyl moieties into respective lipid products. Phosphorimaging signals were visualized using a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantitated using the ImageQuant software. The labeled products in TLC plates were also scraped into scintillation vials to quantitate the incorporation of radioactivity into lipid products by a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system (Fullerton, CA). The isomers of monoacylglycerols (rac-1-oleoylglycerol, sn-2-oleoylglycerol,rac-1-stearoylglycerol, andsn-3-stearoylglycerol) were from Sigma. Diacylglycerols (sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol,rac-1,2-dioleoylglycerol, sn-1,3- dioleoylglycerol, rac-1,2-distearoylglycerol, andsn-1,3-distearoylglycerol) and triacylglycerols (glycerol trioleate and glycerol tristearate) were purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Toronto, Canada). To analyze the tissue distribution pattern of mouse MGAT2 mRNA, multiple tissue poly(A)+RNA Northern blots from OriGene Technologies Inc. (Rockville, MD) or BioChain Institute Inc. (Hayward, CA) were hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol; ICN Radiochemicals) labeled probes prepared from full-length cDNA of mouse MGAT2 using a random primer DNA labeling system (Invitrogen). Hybridization was carried out in ULTRAhyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 50 °C overnight, followed by three washes at 55 °C in 2× SSC buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1 mm EDTA. Blots were stripped with boiling 1% SDS to remove radiolabeled probe and reprobed with β-actin cDNA as an internal control. The blots were exposed to Bio-Max MR film or a PhosphorImager screen to visualize the signals, which were quantitated using ImageQuant (Amersham Biosciences). Yen et al. (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) recently reported the cloning and characterization of the first mammalian MGAT, MGAT1. Surprisingly, the mouseMGAT1 gene is not expressed in the small intestine, a tissue that exhibits the highest MGAT enzyme activity (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar); hence, the gene responsible for the intestinal MGAT activity remains to be identified. Using the mouse MGAT1 cDNA as a query sequence for blast analysis of the public genomic and expressed sequence tag data bases, we identified and cloned a MGAT candidate gene, MGAT2, by PCR amplification. The mouse MGAT2 gene predicts a 334-amino acid protein of 38.6 kDa and possesses at least one transmembrane region, as suggested by a 40-amino acid signal peptide at the N terminus (MVEFAPLLVPWERRLQTFAVLQWVFSFLALAQLCIVIFVG), and one potential tyrosine phosphorylation site. There is no obvious N-linked glycosylation site within the protein predicted by the sequence analysis. Mouse MGAT2 is localized at chromosome 7 at 7E1. Sequence comparison indicates that the mouse MGAT2 protein shares extensive homology (52.5% identity) with MGAT1, which spans the entire molecule (Fig. 1). The mouse MGAT2 also shares close similarity in hydrophobicity profile with MGAT1 (Fig.2). Although the MGAT2 shares significant sequence homology (47.5%) with the mouse DGAT2 as well, the homology does not cover the entire molecule (data not shown). Likewise, the MGAT2 protein also differs from the mouse DGAT2 in hydrophobicity profile (Fig. 2). These features predict the mouse MGAT2 as a novel member of the MGAT family of enzymes.Figure 2Comparison of hydrophobicity profiles among the mouse MGAT2, MGAT1, and DGAT2 proteins. The hydrophobicity profiles are assessed by Kyte-Doolittle analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The tissue distribution of mouse MGAT2 mRNA was analyzed by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3). A 1.8-kbMGAT2 mRNA transcript was detected in small intestine, kidney, adipose, and stomach (Fig. 3, A and B). Very low expression levels of MGAT2 were also detected in liver, skeletal muscle, and spleen. When normalized with the mRNA level of β-actin, the expression level was the highest in intestine, followed by kidney, adipose, stomach, liver, skeletal muscle, and spleen (Fig. 3C). In contrast, no observable level of expression was detected in murine brain, heart, lung, skin, testis, and thymus (Fig. 3A). To determine whether the protein encoded by MGAT2 cDNA possesses MGAT, DGAT, or both activities, MGAT2 was transiently expressed in AV-12, COS-7, and Caco-2 cells followed by in vitro enzyme assay analyses. Since MGAT2 shares the closest sequence homology with MGAT1, we first examined MGAT activity in cells transfected with MGAT2 cDNA. In all three cell lines tested, MGAT activity in protein homogenates from MGAT2-transfected cells was significantly higher than that observed in untransfected and mock-transfected (with empty vector) cells (Fig.4A) as assessed by a significant increase of radioactive 1,2(2,3)-dioleoylglycerol product when 2-monooleoylglycerol was used as acyl acceptor, thereby establishing the function of cloned MGAT2 as a synthetic enzyme of diacylglycerol. Radioactivity incorporated into 1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol by homogenate prepared fromMGAT2-transfected AV-12, COS-7, and Caco-2 cells was 70-, 30-, or 35-fold higher, respectively, compared with that from the untransfected or mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B). Since MGAT2 also shares sequence homology with the mouse DGAT2, we next analyzed DGAT activity using the same cell homogenates for the MGAT enzyme assays. As indicated in Fig. 4, C and D, the incorporation of 14C-acyl into triacylglycerol by homogenates from MGAT2-transfected AV-12, COS-7, and Caco-2 cells was 7-, 3-, and 1.5-fold higher than that observed in control or mock-transfected cells, respectively, indicating that MGAT2 also possesses weak DGAT activity. However, the detected DGAT activity is 10-fold lower when compared with the MGAT activity. To investigate substrate stereospecificity, we examined whether MGAT2 can catalyze the acylation of the other stereoisomers of monoacylglycerol. The experiments were conducted under conditions where a 50 μm concentration of each acyl acceptor (rac-1-oleoylglycerol, sn-2-oleoylglycerol,sn-3-stearoylglycerol, or rac-1-stearoylglycerol) was incubated with 25 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA for 20 min. Cell homogenate was prepared from mock-transfected (as negative control), mouse MGAT2 (mMGAT2)-, or mouseMGAT1 (mMGAT1)-transfected COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig.5, MGAT2 can acylate each of four monoacylglycerol isomers to form diacylglycerols. The radioactive bands of diacylglycerols were quantitated, and the results were shown in Fig.5B. The major products were sn-1,3-diacylglycerol and sn-1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol whenrac-1-monoacylglycerol and 2-monoacylglycerol were employed, respectively (Fig. 5). MGAT2 also can usesn-3-stearoylglycerol as substrate (Fig. 5, lane 7 versus lane 3). The chiral sn-1-monoacylglycerol was not included in the present studies due to the lack of commercially available compound. However, under the same concentration (50 μm), a similar amount of diacylglycerol was produced when rac-1-stearoylglycerols were used as substrate in comparison withsn-3-stearoylglycerol (Fig. 5, lane 8 versus lane 7), implying thatsn-1-stearoylglycerol can also be used as substrate of MGAT2. In addition, MGAT2 utilized monoacylglycerol containing unsaturated fatty acyls (rac-1-oleoylglycerol, C18:1) more efficiently than that of saturated fatty acyls (rac-1-stearoylglycerol, C18:0) (Fig. 5, lane 5 versus lane 8). mMGAT1 showed similar patterns of enzymatic activity to those of mMGAT2 (Fig.5, lanes 9–12), which is consistent with a previous report by Yen et al. (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). We next directly compared the pattern of enzymatic activity of mMGAT2 with that of the human DGAT1 (hDGAT1) (14Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar) under the same experimental conditions. When assessed for the MGAT enzyme activity, the murine MGAT2 demonstrated significantly higher MGAT activity than the human DGAT1 (15-fold versus 2-fold) as measured by incorporation of the [14C]oleoyl moiety into 1,2-diacylglycerol by cell homogenates from mMGAT2 and hDGAT1-transfected cells, respectively, as compared with mock-transfected cells (Fig. 6,lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2, bottom bands). In contrast, the production of labeled triacylglycerol by cell homogenates from the hDGAT1-transfected cells was significantly higher than that from the mMGAT2-transfected cells (7.6-fold versus 1.8-fold) when compared with the negative controls (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2, top bands). These data further confirm that MGAT2 is a novel member of the MGAT family of enzymes despite its weak DGAT activity. Furthermore, the MGAT activity of mMGAT2 can be separated from its DGAT activity by treatment with detergent. Solubilization of cell homogenates by Triton X-100 abolished the DGAT activity but not the MGAT activity of mMGAT2 (Fig. 6,lane 5 versus lane 4). We next examined the biochemical characteristics of MGAT activity in cell homogenate from MGAT2-transfected COS-7 cells. The dependence of the MGAT2 activity on the protein concentration in the reaction as well as the incubation time is shown in Fig. 7, A andB, respectively. In Fig. 7A, increased amounts of protein homogenate from MGAT2-transfected or 500 μg of that from mock-transfected cells were incubated with 200 μmSn-2-monooleoylglycerol and 25 μm[14C]oleoyl-CoA for 10 min, followed by lipid extraction and TLC assay. In Fig. 7B, 50 μg of protein homogenate was incubated with the above mentioned substrates for 0–60 min. MGAT activity levels of MGAT2, as assessed by the formation of radioactive 1,2(2,3)-dioleoylglycerol, increased proportionately with incubation times (Fig. 7B). The embedded values in Fig. 7, Aand B, represent the quantitative [14C]1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol produced (arbitrary units/min) in the reaction. Again, the homogenate protein from mock-transfected cells showed only marginal activities (Fig.7A, last lane; Fig. 7B,last two lanes). We further examined the profile of MGAT2 activity at different time points after transfection as well as the kinetics of MGAT activity. The MGAT2 activity can be detected as early as 12 h post-transfection period as judged by a 15-fold increase in the synthesis of radioactive diacylglycerol as compared with the negative controls (Fig.8A). The MGAT activity reached a plateau at 24 h and began to decline at 72 h post-transfection (Fig. 8A). In contrast, cell homogenates from mock-transfected cells collected at 12 and 72 h post-transfection did not display any increase of MGAT activity (1.2versus 1.0 unit). We next analyzed the effect of substrates concentration on the enzyme activity of MGAT2. When the concentration of one component of MGAT substrates, eitherSn-2-monooleoylglycerol or oleoyl-CoA, was increased while the other was held constant (25 μm for oleoyl-CoA and 200 μm for Sn-2-monooleoylglycerol) in the reaction, the formation of dioleoylglycerol also increased over a wide range (0–66 μm for both substrates) (Fig.8B). Further increases in substrate concentration resulted in inhibition of the MGAT activity (Fig. 8B). It has been known for some time that MGAT enzyme activity is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of triacylglycerol in the small intestine, which generates 80% of the triacylglycerol levels in chylomicrons (21Tso P. Crissinger K. Stipanuk M.H. in Biochemical and Physiological Aspects of Human Nutrition. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia2000: 125-141Google Scholar). However, a clear understanding of the biosynthesis pathway of glycerolipids in intestinal mucosa had been hindered by the absence of the purified enzymes. Although a mouse MGAT (MGAT1) enzyme was recently identified by its sequence homology to the mammalian DGAT2 gene (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the mouse MGAT1 is not expressed in small intestine, where dietary absorption takes place (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), implying the existence of another MGATgene. In the present studies, we have identified and characterized a gene encoding a MGAT enzyme from a mouse intestinal cDNA library by its sequence homology to mouse MGAT1 and hence named MGAT2. In addition to high sequence homology to MGAT1, the hydrophobicity profile of the mouse MGAT2 protein also shares striking similarity with that of the mouse MGAT1 but is quite different from that of the mouse DGAT2. Evidence that the mouse MGAT2 is a MGAT enzyme is provided by the findings that the MGAT2 expressed in three different mammalian cell lines catalyzed significantly the monocylglycerol synthesis as measured by a more than 30-fold increase in radiolabeled diacylglycerol than that from mock-transfected cells. Furthermore, the increased MGAT activity was dependent on the concentrations of either substrate, monoacylglycerol or oleoyl-CoA. Protein homogenate from MGAT2-transfected cells showed time- and dose-dependent responses with incubation time and amount of protein, whereas this phenomenon was not found in control cells under the same conditions. The MGAT activity coincides with the expression profile of theMGAT2 transgene, which can be detected as early as 12 h after transfection and reached a plateau at 48 h post-transfection. As observed with MGAT1 (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), cell homogenates from three different mammalian cell lines transiently expressing MGAT2 also displayed significantly higher DGAT activity than that from mock-transfected cells. The DGAT activity is more pronounced with an extended incubation time. However, the DGAT activity is much weaker than the MGAT activity as assessed by the rate of formation of radioactive products (700 pmol of diacylglycerol/min/mg of protein versus 29 pmol of triacylglycerol/min/mg of protein in AV-12 cells) catalyzed by mouse MGAT2 in the assay. This is consistent with our observation that no significant levels of triacylglycerol over background were detected in the MGAT assay from MGAT2-transfected cells, although MGAT2 produced a significant amount of diacylglycerol (over 10 μm) during 10 min of incubation. Furthermore, when compared directly with the human DGAT1 enzyme for substrate specificity under the same experimental conditions, the murine MGAT2 demonstrated significantly higher MGAT activity than the human DGAT1 enzyme that exhibited primarily the DGAT activity, thus establishing the MGAT2 as a new member of the MGAT family of enzymes. A fatty acyl-CoA is required for the display of MGAT activity, since the incorporation of [3H]oleic acid into diacylglycerol by membrane protein from MGAT2-transfected cells is not significantly higher than that by membrane from wild type cells (data not shown), indicating that, similar to DGAT1, the activity of MGAT2 is CoA-dependent (14Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C. Welch C.B. Lusis A.J. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13018-13023Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Tsujita et al. (20Tsujita T. Miyazaki T. Tabei R. Okuda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2156-2161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported a relatively high CoA-independent MGAT activity due to pancreatic lipase distributed within intestinal cells, which may serve as an alternative pathway for diacylglycerol synthesis in intestinal mucosa. The individual role of these two different pathways in intestinal fat absorption remains unknown and awaits further investigation. It was reported that MGAT and DGAT are integral membrane proteins, and application of detergent severely inhibited the activity, which makes it difficult to purify them, because tight lipid-protein interactions are necessary for their optimal activities (13Lehner R. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13630-13636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, our result shows that solubilization of MGAT2-transfected cells by Triton X-100, a nonionic detergent, resulted in a total loss of DGAT activity but did not affect the MGAT activity possessed by MGAT2. Thus, dependence on membrane integrity can be used to separate the DGAT activity from the MGAT activity of the murine MGAT2 enzyme. Using the intestinal mucosal microsomes, Paltauf and Johnston (22Paltauf F. Johnston J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 239: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) reported the utilization of a series of monoalkyl and monoacyl glycerols as substrates for glyceride synthesis. In their studies, bothsn-1- and sn-2-alkyl glycerols are acylated, whereas the sn-3-alkyl was a poor substrate. However, each of the sn-acyl monoglycerols could be utilized as substrate for the intestinal mucosa (22Paltauf F. Johnston J.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 239: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, there were observed differences between the sn-alkyl and acyl glycerols in their studies. Our data show that MGAT2 expressed in mammalian cells can catalyze the acylation of rac-1-, sn-2-, andsn-3-monoacylglycerol (Fig. 5). Studies with everted sacs of rat intestinal mucosa (23Breckenridge W.C. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 1184-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 24Breckenridge W.C. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 1170-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and a purified monoacylglycerol acyltransferase from rat intestinal mucosa (25Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) indicated the acylation in sn-1- and sn-3-positions of thesn-2-monoacylglycerol occurred at about the same rate with a slight preference at sn-1-position. In contrast, Johnstonet al. (26Johnston J.M. Paultauf F. Schiller C.M. Schultz L.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 218: 124-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that the intestinal microsomes greatly preferred to acylate the sn-1-position, compared with thesn-3-position. Further stereospecific analysis of 1,2(2,3)-diacylglycerol product would resolve the issue of whether mMGAT2 has a preference at the sn-1- orsn-3-position of 2-monoacylglycerol. Manganaro and Kuksis (25Manganaro F. Kuksis A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1985; 63: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported the purification and preliminary characterization of a 2-monoacylglycerol acyltransferase from rat intestinal villus cells, which gives a single band of 37,000 daltons on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This is very close to the 38,600 daltons predicted by the mouse MGAT2. Additionally, both enzymes catalyzed efficient acylation of 2-monoacyglcerols. However, analysis of the amino acid composition of the mouse MGAT2 revealed significant differences between the two enzymes (data not shown). Thus, the purified enzyme might represent a novel isoform/homologue of the MGAT enzyme that remains to be identified. One of the unique features of MGAT2 is its selective tissue expression pattern, which is quite different from the previously reported twoDGAT genes (DGAT1 and DGAT2) andMGAT1 gene. The DGAT1 and DGAT2 genes are ubiquitously expressed, whereas the MGAT1 expression is absent in the small intestine (14Cases S. Smith S.J. Zheng Y.W. Myers H.M. Lear S.R. Sande E. Novak S. Collins C.

Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mouseMGAT2 gene is most abundantly expressed in small intestine, which is consistent with the previous report that the mouse small intestine exhibits the highest MGAT activity among all of the tissues examined (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Although it remains elusive, the data suggest that the mouse MGAT2 may play an important role in dietary fat absorption. A high level of MGAT2 expression was also detected in mouse kidney, a tissue where triacylglycerol synthesis and MGAT activity are reported (27Barac-Nieto M. Cohen J.J. Nephron. 1971; 8: 488-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Trimble M.E. Life Sci. 1978; 22: 883-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 29Trimble M.E. Harrington Jr., W.W. Bowman R.H. Curr.

Additionally, MGAT2 expression is detected in the white adipocytes, implicating a role in fat storage. In contrast to abundantMGAT1 expression in the stomach (16Yen C.L. Stone S.J. Cases S. Zhou P. Farese Jr., R.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8512-8517Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), only a low level ofMGAT2 mRNA is detected in this tissue, which is consistent with the pattern of dietary fat absorption that starts in stomach and mainly occurs in small intestine (1Phan C.T. Tso P. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D299-D319Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consumption of a western diet enriched with a high fat content has been cited as one of the common causes of the ongoing epidemic of obesity. In a recent study conducted in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty rat, which is an animal model of diabetes and obesity, increased small intestine MGAT activities were associated with the onset of the metabolic diseases (31Luan Y. Hirashima T. Man Z.W. Wang M.W. Kawano K. Sumida T. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 2002; 57: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In Zucker obese rats, although the specific activities of MGAT in the small intestine were not different from those in lean rats, the total activity of MGAT increased significantly in the obese rats because of the heavy and large intestinal segments (32Jamdar S.C. Cao W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1255: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The importance of triacylglycerol synthesis and storage is further underlined by recent characterization of mice deficient in one of the DGAT genes (8Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat. Genet. 2000; 25: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Inactivation of DGAT1 results in mice that are resistant to diet-induced obesity and other related metabolic abnormalities (8Smith S.J. Cases S. Jensen D.R. Chen H.C. Sande E. Tow B. Sanan D.A. Raber J. Eckel R.H. Farese Jr., R.V. Nat.

Our current study on MGAT2 has provided basic information for future work on the potential physiological and pathological roles of MGAT2 in dietary fat absorption and thus may present MGAT2 as an attractive drug target for obesity intervention.

These exoskeletons (also called hard tissues or shells) have morphological, chemical, and physical properties that are never shown by the corresponding abiotic crystals. They are biocomposites (bioceramics), and organic macromolecules are their key components. Much of what is known about biominerals is deduced from the nacreous layers of mollusks, and it is believed that the organic matrix serves as a guide for crystal growth (1Weiner S. Hood L. Science. 1975; 190: 987-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Weiner S. Traub W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1984; 304: 425-434Crossref Google Scholar).

Unfortunately, it is often said that a mollusk shell consists of an outer calcitic and an inner aragonitic layer (nacre), although this structure is rare. In fact, these shells exhibit various microstructural types, the arrangement of which strongly depends on the taxa. Currently, little data are available on the organic matrices extracted from mollusk shells. Pinna nobilis and Pinctada margaritifera are two modern pteriomorphid bivalves with shells composed of an outer calcitic prismatic layer and an inner aragonitic nacreous layer. Their calcitic prisms offer remarkable advantages to investigate the organization of biocrystals. For example, they are large units that globally exhibit a single crystal-like organization. These prisms are built by a series of growth steps and surrounded by thick organic walls (6Nathusius-Königsborn, W.

Hist.) Zool. 1969; 3: 1-125Google Scholar) the outer layers of Pinnaand Pinctada are composed of calcitic “simple prisms.” Their crystallographic c axes are normal to the layer surfaces.

However, repeated observations have shown some differences between the two shells. In Pinctada martensi, thin sections observed in polarized light show that each prism extinguishes in several smaller blocks (8Wada K. Bull. Natl. Pearl Res.

Thus, before the cloning of “pure” proteins of mollusk shell layers, a better knowledge of the bulk composition of their SOM is necessary as a first step in understanding the mechanisms of layer formation. From preliminary studies of the molecular weights of the SOM extracted from the prisms, Pinna and Pinctada are different (15Marin F. Muyzer G. Dauphin Y. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1994; 318: 1653-1659Google Scholar, 25Cuif J.P. Dauphin Y. Gautret P. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 1988; 307: 1943-1948Google Scholar, 26Cuif J.P. Dauphin Y. Gautret P. Raguideau A. Bull. Soc. Géol. Fr. 1989; 8: 569-575Crossref Google Scholar). While pursuing a long term study of calcified biominerals, the present study was undertaken to extract and compare the SOM of the calcitic prisms of Pinna andPinctada and to relate these SOM to the simple prism concept. Unlike many studies, this work is not focused on only the protein content. The location of the organic matrices and the presence of sugars are also considered. Specimens of P. margaritifera (L.) (Pteriomorpha, Pterioida, Pteriacea, Pteriidae) were collected in French Polynesia. P. nobilis L. (Pteriomorpha, Mytiloida, Pinnacea, Pinnidae) samples came from the Mediterranean Sea. Isoelectric focusing calibration kit (pH 2.5–6.5) was from Amersham Biosciences. Low range SDS-PAGE standards (19–107 kDa), kaleidoscope-prestained standards (6.9–202 kDa), and gel filtration standards were from Bio-Rad. Chondroitin sulfate A was purchased from Sigma. Rapid Decalcifier was from Apex Engineering Products Corporation. BSA was from Eurobio, and chymotrypsin was from Merck. The traditional method for obtaining information about the shell microstructures is scanning electron microscopy. Fractures and polished etched sections have been observed with Philips 505 and XL30 SEM. Acidic and enzymatic etchings were used to reveal the details of the microstructures of the polished sections. Samples were also studied using a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Veeco) multi-mode scanning probe microscope operating in tapping mode. The tapping mode AFM utilizes an oscillating tip at a tip amplitude of approximately several tens of nanometers when the tip is not in contact with the surface. Because the tip is no longer in permanent contact with the sample surface during the scanning motion, sample alteration can be avoided. The resolution of tapping mode AFM is on the order of a few nanometers. Details of the etchings for SEM and AFM observations are given in the figure legends. Samples were immersed in 3% NaClO for 1 h to remove organic contaminants, rinsed with Milli-Q water, dried, and ground into powder. Powdered samples were immersed in 5 ml of Milli-Q water and then decalcified by progressive addition of 50% acetic acid so that the pH (automatically controlled with a titrimeter) is above 4. The entire extract was directly centrifuged at 21,000 × gfor 15 min, which separated the supernatant (soluble) and precipitated (insoluble) fractions. The soluble fraction was desalted by exchange with Milli-Q water on a Microconcentrator (Filtron) using a 3-kDa cut-off membrane and lyophilized. SOM were dissolved in Milli-Q water. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer LS40 fluorescence detector equipped with a Xenon lamp and a silica flow cell. Sample spectra were corrected for background to minimize residual fluorescence effects. UV spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-1601 spectrophotometer equipped with deuterium and tungsten lamps and double beam optics. The monochromator slit aperture is fixed at 2 nm. Before a sample spectrum was run, a background spectrum was measured for Milli-Q water. All spectra were recorded from 250 to 350 nm. All spectra were recorded at a 4-cm−1 resolution with 64 scans with a strong Norton-Beer apodization on a PerkinElmer Model 1600 Fourier transform infrared spectrometer in the wave number range of 4000–450 cm−1. The spectrometer was equipped with a diffuse reflectance accessory, which permits DRIFT measurements with high sensitivity on powders. All spectra were corrected by the Kubelka-Munk function, and the bands were identified by the software. The system was purged and permanently maintained under nitrogen to reduce atmospheric CO2 and H2O absorption. A background spectrum was measured for pure KBr. The ratio of the sample spectra was automatically determined against background to minimize CO2 and H2O bands. Several spectra from the same extracted SOM and from different SOM were done with correlation coefficients higher than 95%. Only minor differences attributed to humidity are sometimes present. Chromatographic analyses were performed using two TSK G5000PW and G3000PW columns connected in series (200–1 × 106 Da). They were eluted with 0.2 mm Tris, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in high sensitivity refractive index detector PE 200 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and thermo separation products detector 4100 and monitored at 226, 254, and 278 nm. These two detectors were connected in series so that there is a difference in the elution times. Other analyses were done using the same TSK columns connected in series, eluted with a dissociative buffer (4 m guanidinium chloride, pH 6, at a flow rate of 0.70 ml/min), and monitored at 275 nm. SOM were also chromatographed using a Superose 12 column (APB) with a separation range from 1 to 300 kDa and exclusion limit of 2000 kDa. The Superose 12 column was eluted with 4 mguanidinium chloride, pH 6, at a flow rate of 0.70 ml/min and monitored at 275 nm. The lyophilized SOM were dissolved in the buffer overnight, and all analyses were done at ambient temperature. Isoelectric points were determined according to Dauphin and Cuif (16Dauphin Y. Cuif J.P. Ann. Sci. Nat. 1999; 2: 73-85Google Scholar, 27Dauphin Y. Cuif J.P. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1180-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). One-dimensional microslab isoelectric focusing was done on homogeneous polyacrylamide gels. With the Bio-Rad Model 111 Mini IEF cell, the gel was run without electrode buffers (non-denaturing dry IEF). The lyophilized SOM were redissolved in Milli-Q water. Focusing was carried out in a stepped fashion to prevent overheating. Two staining procedures were used: 1) Coomassie Blue-Crocein Scarlet for proteins or weakly glycosylated proteins and 2) Acridine Orange for acidic sulfated sugars. For the Coomassie Blue method, gels were placed in 27% ethanol, 10% acetic acid, 0.04% Coomassie Blue R-250, 0.5% CuSO4, and 0.05% Crocein Scarlet for 1.5 h (fixing and staining solution). The first destaining solution contained 12% ethanol, 7% acetic acid, and 0.5% CuSO4. The second destaining solution contained 25% ethanol and 7% acetic acid. For the Acridine Orange method, gels were placed in a solution of methanol (40%) and acetic acid (10%) for 30 min (fixing solution). Acridine Orange was dissolved in Milli-Q water (20 mg of Acridine Orange in 95 ml of H2O and 5 ml of methanol). Gels were placed in the solution for 30 min and then destained with Milli-Q water. The low pI calibration kit (APB) with pH among 2.5 and 6.5, BSA, and ribonuclease were used. They were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The molecular groups were separated in the first dimension by isoelectric focusing in IPG strips (Precast Immobilin DryStrip, 11 cm, pH 3–10, APB) on a Multiphor II system. The lyophilized samples were dissolved in the sample buffer (8 m urea, 0.5% Triton X-100, 40 mm dithiothreitol, Pharmalyte 3–10, bromphenol blue) and centrifuged for 10 min at 17,500 × g. This solution was applied to the Immobilin strips in a horizontal reswelling cassette overnight. The settings used for IEF were 300 V for 6.5 h and 2000 V for 11 h. The Multitemp III cooling bath was set at 20 °C. After the focusing was complete, the second step was done according to Dauphin (28Dauphin Y. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 2001; 28: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were placed in 40% methanol with 10% acetic acid for 24 h to fix the proteins and to remove the SDS. Proteins and glycoproteins were detected by silver staining (Bio-Rad silver stain kit), and sulfated acidic mucopolysaccharides were stained with Alcian Blue. Silver staining was followed by Alcian Blue. The work was carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The ID21 Scanning x-ray Microscope uses Fresnel zone plates as focusing optics to generate a submicron x-ray probe, which is used to investigate the sample with various contrast mechanisms (fluorescence, transmission, and phase contrast). An energy-dispersive high purity Ge detector (Gamma-Tech, Princeton, NJ) mounted in the horizontal plane perpendicular to the beam collects the fluorescence emission photons. This geometry minimizes the contribution of elastic scattering. Provided the sample is thin enough, a Si photodiode can be mounted downstream from the sample to exploit the transmission signal as well. An energy range between 2 and 7 keV is available, which gives access to the K-edge of sulfur at 2472 eV. The energy scan is ensured by a fixed-exit double crystal Si111 monochromator located upstream from the microscope, which offers an energy resolution necessary to resolve XANES features. This experiment required operating the x-ray microscope under vacuum to avoid the strong absorption of the sulfur emission lines by air. Untreated longitudinal fractures in the outer layer ofP. no- bilis do not exhibit intraprismatic structures. Only long straight parallel prisms are visible (diameter 70 μm) (Fig.1A). Rare and faint growth lines are sometimes seen on the outer surface of the prisms in such fractures. A polished and strongly etched transverse section shows the thick organic interprismatic walls and the polygonal shape of the prisms (Fig. 1B). Polished and etched longitudinal sections show the thick interprismatic walls and transverse synchronous growth lines across the adjacent prisms (Fig. 1C). Polished, fixed, and decalcified transverse sections show intraprismatic parallel crests (Fig. 1D). The interprismatic wall is somewhat etched by enzymatic hydrolysis, which supports its organic composition, and the intraprismatic parallel crests remain visible (Fig.1E). Thin sections observed with cross-nicols show that each prism is a monocrystal with a unique extinction pattern (Fig.1F). However, these prisms are not compact structures. They are composed of oblique and elongated crystallites (Fig. 1,G–H), the width of which varies from 150 to 180 nm. These crystallites are subdivided into smaller rounded units with distinct boundaries in height and phase images, suggesting that they are surrounded by organic envelopes (Fig. 1I). Similar unetched fractures of Pinctada show another pattern. The elongated prisms are not so straight (Fig.2A). Their surfaces seem to be corrugated, and pieces of organic sheaths cut along the growth lines are preserved (Fig. 2B). The inner structures of the prisms seem homogeneous in transverse-untreated sections, and after complete removal of the mineral portion, only the outer thick organic walls are present. However, the polished and etched transverse sections are different from those of Pinna. Enzymatic hydrolyses reveal intraprismatic sinuous lacunae (Fig. 2C). The nonspecific enzymes used and the basic pH suggested that these lacunae are the remains of intraprismatic organic membranes. The orientations of crystallites on both sides of these intraprismatic membranes within a prism are not similar (Fig. 2D). These sinuous intraprismatic lacunae are also present in fixed and etched transverse sections (Fig. 2E). In such preparations, the interprismatic walls are partially destroyed. Transverse thin sections observed with cross-nicols confirm that the prisms are composite crystals (Fig.2F). AFM observations show that the elongated crystallites are irregularly aligned (Fig. 2, G and H). Their width is ∼110 nm, whereas their length varies from 250 to 400 nm. Round units at 50–70 nm in diameter are sometimes present. As withPinna, the crystallites seem surrounded by a thin organic layer according to the phase images (Fig. 2I). The long polygonal calcitic prisms in both Pinna andPinctada are surrounded by a thick organic wall and exhibit growth lines in longitudinal sections. However, prismatic units ofPinna are monocrystalline, whereas those ofPinctada are not, as shown by thin sections and complex preparative processes. The enzymatic hydrolyses were done at pH >7 so that the mineral part is not strongly etched and only a small dissolution can occur. Thus, the intraprismatic sinuous lacunae inPinctada indicate the presence of sinuous organic membranes. Besides, there is a clear difference between these sinuous intraprismatic organic membranes and the outer walls. The sinuous intraprismatic organic membranes are destroyed by acid and enzymes, whereas the outer walls are not. The ultrastructure ofPinctada is then more complex than that of Pinna,which suggests that the intraprismatic organic matrix ofPinctada is also more complex. Hence, the simple prism concept appears not to be appropriate. The emission scan of CS exhibits a small peak at 287 nm and a main peak at 353 nm for a 257-nm excitation. Peaks are at 290 and 342 nm for BSA (Fig. 3A). Only a small peak is visible at 287 nm in Pinctada and a shoulder is visible in Pinna. The emission scan of CS shows a shoulder at 310 nm and a main peak at 353 nm for a 275-nm excitation. A peak at 342 nm is visible in the BSA spectrum. A small peak at 303 nm is present in Pinna and PinctadaSOM (Fig. 3B). CS shows a peak at 353 nm for a 287-nm excitation, whereas that of BSA is at 342 nm. Only shoulders are present in Pinna and Pinctada spectra (Fig.3C). From UV spectra, it appears that Pinna andPinctada SOM are not pure proteins and that these proteins have a low content of aromatic amino acids (data not shown). From fluorescence and UV spectra (data not shown), it may be inferred (1Weiner S. Hood L. Science. 1975; 190: 987-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) that the SOM of Pinna and Pinctada are different (2Weiner S. Traub W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1984; 304: 425-434Crossref Google Scholar), that these matrices are not pure proteins (3Krampitz G. Engels J. Cazaux C. Watabe N. Wilbur K.M. The Mechanisms of Mineralization in the Invertebrates and Plants. University of South Carolina Press, Columbia, SC1976: 155-173Google Scholar), and that their aromatic amino acid contents are very low. In infrared spectra, the amide I band is the most intense absorption band for proteins. The presence of bands arising from amino acid side chains in the region between 1800 and 1400 cm−1 (amides I and II) has been thoroughly investigated (29Venyaminov S.Yu. Kalnin N.N. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 1243-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). It has been established that among the 20 proteinogenous amino acids, only residues arginine, asparagine, glutamine, aspartic and glutamic acids, lysine, tyrosine, histidine, and phenylalanine have intense absorption in this region. Pinna has nine bands, and Pinctada has eight bands in this part of the spectrum. The prominent band in the two matrices is the amide I band near 1653 cm−1; thus, it may be supposed that components have adopted the α-helical conformation (Figs. 4 and5). However, precise interpretations of bands in the amide I region are difficult, because there is an overlap of the α-helical with random coil structures. The 1647 cm−1 band (amide I) may be assigned to unordered structures, this band being absent from Pinctada. Other bands show the presence of β-turn and β-sheet structures. The prominent amide II bands are near 1560 cm−1(Pinna) and 1540 cm−1 (Pinctada). Strong carboxylate absorption bands are present at 1419–1420 and 1717 cm−1 in both SOM. Bands at 1717 and 1575 cm−1are usually assigned to aspartic acid, whereas bands at 1712 and 1558 cm−1 are assigned to glutamic acid. These four bands are present in Pinctada, whereas bands corresponding to aspartate (1622 and 1678 cm−1) and glutamate (1610 and 1670 cm−1) are absent. In Pinna, bands assigned to aspartic acid (1574 and 1717 cm−1) are present, but bands related to aspartate are absent. One band is present for glutamic acid (1560 cm−1), and two bands are present for glutamate. The small band near 1245 cm−1 may imply that some molecules are sulfated (Fig. 5). Amide A bands are similar in both samples and are not specific for secondary structures.Figure 5Detailed FTIR spectra of the SOM ofPinna and Pinctada showing the different bands in the amide I, amide II, and the sugar region (A) and in the amide I and II domains (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All of these bands are present in both proteins and sugars. Thus, it is possible that the strong amide A, I and II bands, are also due to sugars as shown by the spectra of CS (30Cael J.J. Winter W.T. Arnott S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 125: 21-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 31Dauphin Y. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part A Physiol. 2002; 132: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the other hand, bands between 1000 and 1150 cm−1, which are absent from protein spectra, are usually considered characteristic of only the sugars. Thus, in complex components, it is difficult to infer the low or high contents of sugars from the intensity of bands of only the 1000–1150-cm−1 region. In both SOM, these specific bands are weak, but this is not necessarily evidence of a low sugar content. Moreover, some molecules seem sulfated. The HPLC chromatogram of Pinna at 226 nm in non-dissociative buffer (Tris) shows a small peak of excluded large molecules (>1 × 106 Da), a main peak at 277 kDa, and a minor peak estimated at 12 kDa (Fig.6A). At 254 and 278 nm, the overall peaks are similar to those detected at 226 nm, but the excluded molecules are the main peak. Only the largest and smallest molecular masses are present in the refractometric chromatogram, the main peak being at 277 kDa (Fig. 7). There is a strong decrease in the intensity of the peaks from 226 to 278 nm, showing a low protein content. Refractive index detectors (or refractometers) are sensitive to a wide range of organic compounds, but they are typically used to analyze compounds that do not have strong absorbance in the UV range such as sugars. In the experimental conditions used, low quality commercial BSA shows one or two small peaks, whereas high purity globular proteins do not show peaks. CS shows a strong peak. These data may imply that the main components of the Pinna SOM are sugars or highly glycosylated proteins.Figure 7HPLC refractometric profiles ofPinna and Pinctada showing the high content of sugars in the SOM of Pinna.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The 226-nm profile of Pinctada shows three distinct peaks of increasing intensities: one of excluded molecules, a second one at 377 kDa, and the last one at 110 kDa (Fig. 6B). As forPinna, the 278- and 254-nm profiles are similar to each other and different from the profile at 226 nm. The main peak is at 110 kDa, the middle peak is a shoulder, and the excluded molecules are present. These three peaks are present in the refractometric profiles (Fig. 7), the excluded molecules being the most intense. It should be noted that in Figs. 6 and 7, elution times are different for the equivalent peaks in each elution profile because of the serial connection of the two detectors. The comparison of the UV and refractometric HPLC profiles confirms the UV-fluorescence data. The SOM of Pinna andPinctada are different. Not only are the molecular weights different, but each peak has a peculiar composition. The 226-nm profiles of Pinna and Pinctada show similar intensities, but the refractometric profile of Pinna is more intense than that of Pinctada. UV and refractometric profiles of a sample were acquired during the same elution, so that their ratios are not dependent of the quantity of SOM. According to the comparison of these profiles and the 226/278 nm ratios,Pinna seems to contain a higher proportion of sugars thanPinctada. Components with molecular masses greater than 106 Da are present in Pinna (Fig.8A), the main peak being at ∼120 kDa. The Pinctada profile shows more peaks. A faint shoulder is indicative of excluded components (>106 Da), other peaks being at ∼98 and 23 kDa (Fig. 8A). The separation range of Superose 12 chromatography in the dissociative buffer (1,000–300,000 Da) is narrower than that of the TSK columns. The Pinna profile shows an excluded peak (>300 kDa) and a broad peak at 34 kDa (Fig. 8B). The Pinctadaprofile is more complex with a small excluded peak, several shoulders, a main peak of apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa, and several small peaks (Fig. 8B). Clearly, there is a discrepancy in the molecular mass estimated for the molecules in the major peak of thePinna SOM on the two different columns (120 and 34 kDa). The basis for this discrepancy is not readily apparent but may indicate some peculiarity regarding the molecules contained in this peak. Despite the observed differences in the dissociative buffer,Pinna and Pinctada SOM are different. The comparison of the 280-nm (non-dissociative buffer) and 275-nm (dissociative buffer) profiles shows t"

Plenum Press, New York and London1996: 95-144Google Scholar). In tumor cells, polySia has an important role in metastasis via an anti-adhesive effect between cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions (20Michalides R. Kwa B. Springall D. van Zandwijk N. Koopman J.

This class of sialyl groups consists of diSia and oligoSia with up to seven Sia residues and is present in functionally important glycoproteins, such as adiponectin, which is involved in energy consumption in obesity; CD166, which is involved in neurite extension and T cell activation; and integrin, which is involved in cell-matrix interactions. The study of these novel structures is possible because of the recently developed, highly sensitive detection techniques (12Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy II, F.A.

Our search for di/oligo/polySia-containing glycoproteins in several cell lines using these methods revealed that COMMA-1D cells, which derive from mammary epithelial cells, contain high amounts of internal NeuAc (8-O-substituted Neu5Ac) residues (30Sato C. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Glycoconjugate J. 1999; 16 (suppl.): 117Google Scholar). This preliminary finding led us to search for polySia-containing glycoprotein(s) in milk. We have now identified such glycoproteins in human milk. In this study, we demonstrate that CD36 in human milk is a new polySia-containing glycoprotein using both immunochemical and chemical methods. This is the first report of the presence of polySia-containing glycoprotein other than NCAM in non-neural tissues.

Concentration of proteins was determined by the BCA protein assay kit or by the measurement of absorbance at 280 nm. Pig embryonic brain homogenates were prepared as described previously (12Sato C.

Samples treated with or without PNGase F (1.0 milliunit) at 37 °C for 20 h were dissolved in Laemmli buffer with or without 5% mercaptoethanol and placed at 60 °C for 20 min. The samples were then electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by silver staining or electroblotted on the PVDF membrane using a semidry blotting apparatus. The PVDF membrane was blocked with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 0.15 m NaCl (PBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. After treatment with or without Endo-N (0.009–9.0 unit/ml) at 37 °C for 17 h or 0.1 n NaOH at 37 °C for 20 h, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibody mAb 12E3 (0.36 μg/ml), mAb 735 (1.0 μg/ml), mAb OL28 antibody (35.2 μg/ml), mAb S2−566 antibody (1.0 μg/ml), anti-NCAM (2.0 μg/ml), or anti-CD36 (0.40 μg/ml) 4 °C for 16 h. As the secondary antibody, peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM (1:5000 dilution), anti-mouse IgG (1:5000 dilution), and anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000 dilution) were used at 37 °C for 45 min and the color development was carried out as described previously (12Sato C.

Milk (3.3 mg/ml as BSA, 100 μl) was pretreated with 100 μl of 1:1 solution of protein G-Sepharose coupled with rat anti-mouse IgM antibodies at 4 °C for 1 h, and resins were removed. The pretreated milk was incubated with protein G-Sepharose (100 μl) coupled with mAb 12E3 via rat anti-mouse IgM antibodies at 4 °C for 16 h. The resins were washed with four times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and subjected to SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. For immunoprecipitation with anti-CD36, 100 μl of milk that had been pretreated with protein G-Sepharose as described above was incubated with 100 μl of protein G-Sepharose coupled with anti-CD36 at 4 °C for 16 h. The immunoprecipitate was immunoblotted using anti-CD36 and mAb 12E3. We previously demonstrated that several glycoproteins in brain, adipose tissue, and blood have the diSia and oligoSia structures (12Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K.

Further attempts to search for the di/oligo/polySia structures on glycoproteins in other cells and tissues suggested that mouse mammary epithelial cells contained such structures, because high amounts of internal Neu5Ac (→8Neu5Ac) residues were detected using C7/C9 analysis as well as by immunochemical methods (30Sato C. Honda N. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Glycoconjugate J. 1999; 16 (suppl.): 117Google Scholar). Thus, we began to test whether milk contains the polySia structure. We first performed mild acid hydrolysis/fluorometric analysis of human milk. Milk was treated with mild acid, and released oligo/polySia residues were labeled with DMB followed by high performance liquid chromatography on a Resource Q-anion exchange column. When colominic acid, a homo-oligomer and polymer of α2 → 8-linked Neu5Ac, was subjected to these procedures, Neu5Ac dimers of up to octadecamers were successfully separated (Fig.1a). With milk, peaks of dimer to at least octadecamer were also detected (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that human milk contains a polySia structure with DP ranging from 2 to at least 18. The presence of the polySia structure in human milk was also detected using Western blotting with mAb 12E3, which specifically recognizes α2 → 8-linked oligo/polyNeu5Ac with DP ≥ 5. As shown in Fig. 2, b and c(lane 1), the 85-kDa glycoprotein was reactive with mAb 12E3. These results indicate that the 85-kDa gp contains α2 → 8-linked polyNeu5Ac structure. The 85-kDa gp was not reactive with anti-NCAM antibodies, whereas a smear band of a high molecular mass region of embryonic pig brain homogenate was detected with both mAb 12E3 and the anti-NCAM antibodies (lane 2). This finding indicates that the 85-kDa gp is different from polySia-containing NCAM. Many studies have been done on human milk components (33Peterson J.A. Patton S. Hamosh M. Biol. Neonate. 1998; 74: 143-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Based on its molecular mass, we hypothesized that the 85-kDa gp might be CD36. As described previously (34Greenwalt D.E. Watt K.W.K. So O.Y. Jiwani N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7054-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), the human milk CD36 was detected at 85 kDa as one of the major components on SDS-PAGE/silver-stained gels (Fig.2a). To determine whether the 85-kDa gp is CD36, CD36 was immunopurified using anti-CD36 and analyzed with mAb 12E3. The immunopurified CD36 migrated at 85 kDa (Fig.3a, Blot:anti-CD36) and was immunostained with mAb 12E3 (Fig.3a, Blot: 12E3). Similarly, the immunoprecipitate of milk with mAb 12E3 was immunostained at 85 kDa with anti-CD36 (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that the 85-kDa gp is a CD36 containing the polySia structure. To address the question of whether all milk CD36 molecules are polysialylated, we performed quantitative analysis of the CD36 that contains the α2 → 8-linked polySia. The intensity of the anti-CD36 stain of the immunoprecipitate of human milk with mAb 12E3 was densitometrically compared with that of the unprecipitated CD36 and indicated that 4.6% of total CD36 molecules were polysialylated. To confirm that milk CD36 contains α2 → 8-linked polySia, we used Endo-N as a specific probe for detection of α2 → 8-linked polySia. Human milk was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by electroblotting on PVDF membranes. The membranes were treated or untreated with 0.009–9 milliunit/ml Endo-N and then immunodetected with mAb 12E3. As shown in Fig.4a(Blot:12E3), immunostain with mAb 12E3 disappeared with increasing amounts of Endo-N. At 0.9 milliunit or more of Endo-N, the mAb 12E3 immunostain was clearly lost, whereas the anti-CD36 immunostain remained unchanged. These results indicate that milk CD36 contains the α2 → 8-linked polySia with DP ≥ 5 and Endo-N digestion has no effect on the antigenicity of CD36 recognized by anti-CD36. We previously demonstrated that a group of anti-di/oligo/polySia antibodies with defined immunospecificities is useful for determination of the chain length of polySia (12Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy II, F.A. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15422-15431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We used four antibodies, mAb 735 (DP ≥ 11), mAb 12E3 (DP ≥ 5), mAb OL28 (DP ≥ 4), and mAb S2-566 (specific for the diSia structure Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Acα2 → 3Gal) for immunodetection. As shown in Fig. 4b, human milk CD36 was immunostained by all of these antibodies. The fact that milk CD36 was recognized by mAb735 suggests that the DP of the polySia chain is 11 or greater. This is consistent with the results of high performance liquid chromatography analysis of mild acid hydrolysate of human milk (Fig. 1b). The milk CD36 was also reactive with mAb S2-566, suggesting that CD36 contains the diSia as well as a polySia structure. To determine whether polySia is present on the N-linked orO-linked glycan(s), we performed PNGase F digestion and alkaline treatment (0.1 n NaOH at 37 °C for 20 h). The PNGase F digestion resulted in the reduction of the molecular mass of milk CD36 from 85 to 82 kDa without losing mAb 12E3 immunostain on milk CD36 (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, the mAb 12E3 immunostaining of milk CD36 was lost after alkaline treatment. The alkaline treatment had no effect on anti-CD36 antibody immunostaining. These findings indicate that the polySia epitope is present on O-linked glycan(s) in milk CD36. CD36 is present in platelets as well as in milk. To determine whether the polySia on CD36 is common between milk and platelets, platelet CD36 was prepared and tested for the presence of polySia. The platelet CD36 migrated at 88 kDa on SDS-PAGE/immunostaining with anti-CD36, whereas milk CD36 migrated at 85 kDa (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2) as reported previously (34Greenwalt D.E. Watt K.W.K. So O.Y. Jiwani N. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7054-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Platelet CD36 was not immunostained with mAb 12E3 in contrast with milk CD36 (Figs. 3b and 6). This finding indicates that polysialylation of CD36 is specific to milk. To determine whether the polySia on milk CD36 is common among mammals, we analyzed mouse milk using Western blot with mAb 12E3. Mouse milk was reactive with mAb 12E3 at an expected molecular mass (82 kDa) of mouse milk CD36 (35Greenwalt D.E. Lipsky R.H. Okenhouse C.F. Ikeda H. Tandon N.N. Jamieson G.A. Blood. 1992; 80: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Immunostaining of these CD36 with mAb 12E3 was completely lost following Endo-N digestion, whereas the anti-CD36 immunostaining remained unchanged (Fig. 7,Blot: anti-CD36). These results indicate that the polySia on milk CD36 is common between human and mouse. The amounts of the polySia epitope and milk CD36 in colostrum within a week after parturition and milk within 1, 3, and 6 months after parturition were analyzed using Western blot with mAb 12E3 and anti-CD36. The intensity of the bands immunostained with mAb 12E3 and anti-CD36 was quantified densitometrically. The results are summarized in Table I. The quantity of milk CD36 was highest in colostrum. During lactation, the quantity of CD36 in milk reached a minimum of 1 month after parturition and then increased and became constant at 3 and 6 months after parturition. With respect to the polySia on milk CD36, the quantity of the polySia on milk CD36 1 month following parturition was largely constant and slightly larger than that of the colostrum CD36. The proportions of polySia to CD36 reached a maximum in milk at 1 month after parturition and gradually decreased as the lactation stage progressed. The proportion in the colostrum was lowest during lactation. These results suggest that polysialylation of milk CD36 takes place maximally at 1 month after parturition.Table IDevelopmental expression of the polySia on the milk CD36 during lactationPeriods after parturition7 days colostrum1 month milk3 months milk6 months milkNumber of sample11555CD361-aThe quantity of CD36 as estimated by the densitometric analysis of the immunostain with anti-CD36.13,6002100608011,400PolySia1-bThe quantity of polySia as estimated by the densitometric analysis of the immunostain with mAb.12E3. 509064108720 9910PolySia/CD361-cThe proportion of the polySia to CD36 quantities was calculated.0.572 ± 0.2251-dStandard deviation.3.424 ± 0.9381-dStandard deviation.1.491 ± 0.0441-dStandard deviation.1.018 ± 0.4781-dStandard deviation.1-a The quantity of CD36 as estimated by the densitometric analysis of the immunostain with anti-CD36.1-b The quantity of polySia as estimated by the densitometric analysis of the immunostain with mAb.12E3.1-c The proportion of the polySia to CD36 quantities was calculated.1-d Standard deviation.

The polySia NCAM occurs in embryonic brain, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb in adult brain, kidney, heart, muscle (4Troy II, F.A. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids.

Functions of polySia NCAM in neural tissues are well documented (9Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11966-11970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PolySia residues inhibit cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and regulate neural development. PolySia epitopes on tumor cells are a marker of tumor stages (36Tanaka F. Otake Y. Nakagawa T. Kawano Y. Miyahara R. Li M. Yanagihara K. Inui K. Oyanagi H. Yamada T. Nakayama J. Fujimoto I. Ikenaka K. Wada H.

Cancer. 1994; 8 (Suppl.): 34-37Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Fukuda M Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2237-2244PubMed Google Scholar). PolySia is also present in sodium channels. The eel electroplax sodium channel was the first such example (37James W.M. Agnew W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and later, it was reported in the α-subunit of voltage-sensitive sodium channel in adult rat brain (11Zuber C. Lackie P.M. Catterall W.A. Roth J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9965-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the function of polySia on these sodium channels has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we discovered milk CD36 as a third member of polySia-containing glycoproteins in mammals using highly sensitive methods that we developed including two chemical analyses, fluorometric C7/C9 analysis (28Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 261: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and mild acid hydrolysis/fluorometric analysis (29Sato C. Inoue S. Matsuda T. Kitajima K.

Human milk CD36 contains a polySia chain with a DP of at least 18. The polySia structure is attached to O-linked glycan chain(s) but not to N-linked glycan chains. This feature is in contrast with the NCAM-containing polySia on N-linked glycan chains (4Troy II, F.A. Rosenberg A. Biology of the Sialic Acids. Plenum Press, New York and London1996: 95-144Google Scholar). In 1996, Colley and colleagues (38Martersteck C.M. Kedersha N.L. Drapp D.A. Tsui T.G. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) reported the presence of unique glycoproteins containing polySia structures on O-linked glycan chains in MCF7 breast cancer cells and RBL basophilic leukemia cells. These glycoproteins were different from NCAM or the sodium channel α-subunit, although they were not identified at that time (38Martersteck C.M. Kedersha N.L. Drapp D.A. Tsui T.G. Colley K.J. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The polySia-containing glycoproteins in MCF7 cells have a molecular mass of 180–260 kDa, whereas that of human milk CD36 is 85 kDa. Therefore, these glycoproteins are different from CD36 and remain to be elucidated. Milk CD36 is considered to be synthesized in and secreted from the mammary gland (39Mather I.H. J. Dairy Sci. 2000; 83: 203-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, it is suggested that sialyltransferases responsible for the synthesis of polySia onO-linked glycan chains are present in the mammary gland. Because MCF7 cells are derived from human mammary glands, sialyltransferases involved in the synthesis of the polySia on 180–260-kDa glycoproteins might be the same ones used for synthesis of the polySia CD36 in the mammary gland. Two enzymes, PST (ST8Sia IV) and STX (ST8Sia II), are now known to be responsible for the synthesis of polySia on N-linked glycan chains of NCAM (40Tsuji S. Inoue Y. Lee Y.C. Troy II, F.A. Sialobiology and Other Novel Forms of Glycosylation. Gakushin Publishing Company, Osaka, Japan1999: 145-154Google Scholar, 41Angata K. Suzuki M. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36808-36817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated whether these two enzymes are involved in the synthesis of polySia on the O-linked glycan chains of CD36 and the 180–260-kDa glycoproteins. In this regard, we recently reported in a preliminary form that these two enzymes are also involved in the synthesis of polySia on O-linked glycan chains based on studies with fish egg polysialoglycoprotein (42Asahina S. Sato C. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. Glycoconjugate J. 2001; 18: 148Google Scholar). Elucidation of a biosynthetic mechanism for polySia formation on O-liked glycan chains in mammalian cells is under way in our laboratory. Another interesting feature of the glycan structures of milk CD36 is the presence of the diSia epitope, Neu5Acα2 → 8Neu5Acα2 → 3Gal sequence, onO-linked glycan chains. Thus, milk CD36 is a new member of the diSia-containing glycoprotein family that was recently established by our group (12Sato C. Fukuoka H. Ohta K. Matsuda T. Koshino R. Kobayashi K. Troy II, F.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 28849-2885612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) from adipose tissue and CD166 (SC1) from brain and T lymphocytes (27Sato C. Matsuda T. Kitajima K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45299-45305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The polySia epitope was not detected in these two glycoproteins. We do not know at present whether the diSia epitope in milk CD36 is an intermediate form of polySia chain or is linked to a site independent of the polySia-bearing site in milk CD36. Structural determination of the O-linked glycan chains of milk CD36 with and without the polySia epitope will be necessary. The presence of polySia on CD36 appears to be limited to milk. CD36 is a member of the B class of the scavenger receptor superfamily and occurs in milk and blood cells including platelets and some types of macrophages (43Howard L.M. McGregor J.L. Manson D. Leukocyte Typing VII. Oxford University Press, New York2002: 781-783Google Scholar). CD36 is likely to have diverse functions. First, platelet CD36 acts as a receptor for collagen and thrombospondin leading to platelet activation (44Tandn N.N. Kralisz U. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7576-7583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Li W.-X. Howard R.J. Leung L.L.K. J. Biol.

Blood. 1990; 76: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thrombospondin-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis (47Dawson D.W. Pearce S.F.A. Zhong R. Silverstein R.L. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 707-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Second, CD36 in hemopoietic cells acts as a scavenger receptor through binding to apoptotic cells and cell fragments via anionic phospholipids (48Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). CD36 in blood can also bind oxidized low density lipoproteins (49Endemann G.L. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11811-11816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and advanced glycation end products (50Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Aria H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3195-3202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) to eliminate them from systemic circulation. Third, CD36 acts as a constitutive fatty acid transporter of long chain fatty acids (51Febbraio M. Abumrad N.A. Hajjar D.P. Sharma K. Cheng W. Pearce S.F. Silverstein R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19055-19062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the function of milk CD36 has not yet been elucidated. CD36 is integrated in milk fat globule membrane, a layer of milk droplets secreted from mammary epithelial cells (39Mather I.H. J. Dairy Sci. 2000; 83: 203-247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrated that milk CD36, but not platelet CD36, is polysialylated. Milk CD36 of not only human but also mouse is modified by polySia. In human milk, 4.6% CD36 is polysialylated. The level of the polySia in milk CD36 changes during lactation and is maximized 1 month after parturition. The ubiquitous presence in mammals and the lactation stage-dependent expression of the polySia CD36 in milk suggest that polysialylation of milk CD36 is important for the development of mammalian neonates. As a milk component, protection and nutrition of neonates are important aspects to be considered for the polySia of milk CD36. As a protective material, the polySia of milk CD36 can be a natural trap for various pathogenic viruses and bacteria to prevent their invasion into neonates, because sialic acids are often major receptors for such pathogens (52Karlsson K.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Glycosylation states of CD36 affect the binding properties of CD36 to oxidized low density lipoprotein (53Han J. Hajjar D.P. Febbraio M. Nicholson A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21654-21659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The altered binding to the oxidized fat materials by the presence of polySia might prevent such harmful materials from being incorporated into neonates. Another interesting aspect of polySia function in milk is nutrition. Human milk is a rich source of sialic acid (54Carlson S.E. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1985; 41: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), although the significance and metabolic fate of the sialic acids as a nutrient are currently unknown. Morgan and Winick (55Morgan B.L.G. Winick M. J. Nutr. 1980; 110: 416-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) reported that sialic acid exogenously administered by intraperitoneal injection increases production of gangliosides in brain and improves the learning of both well nourished and malnourished rat pups. Carlson and House (24Carlson S.E. House S.G. J. Nutr. 1986; 116: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) reported that both intraperitoneally and orally administered sialic acids increase gangliosides in young rat brain. Thus, the supply of sialic acids to neonates is important for development of the neural system. For these purposes, in addition to de novo synthesis of sialic acids, neonates might incorporate sialic acids from milk. Monomeric forms of sialic acids and polySia might both be good sources of sialic acid."
https://openalex.org/W2011908249,"Information processing in the neuron requires spatial summation of synaptic inputs at the dendrite. In CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, a brief period of correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity, which induces long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD), results in a persistent increase or decrease in the linearity of spatial summation, respectively. Such bidirectional modification of the summation property is specific to the modified input and reflects localized dendritic changes involving I(h) channels and NMDA receptors. Thus, correlated pre- and postsynaptic activity alters not only the strength of the activated input but also its dendritic integration with other inputs."

To understand the molecular basis of DNA recognition by the C/EBP family we determined the x-ray structure of a C/EBPα bZIP polypeptide bound to its cognate DNA site (A−5T−4T−3G−2C−1G1C2A3A4T5) and characterized several basic region mutants. Binding specificity is provided by interactions of basic region residues Arg289, Asn292, Ala295, Val296, Ser299, and Arg300 with DNA bases. A striking feature of the C/EBPα protein-DNA interface that distinguishes it from known bZIP-DNA complexes is the central role of Arg289, which is hydrogen-bonded to base A3, phosphate, Asn292 (invariant in bZIPs), and Asn293. The conformation of Arg289 is also restricted by Tyr285. In accordance with the structural model, mutation of Arg289 or a pair of its interacting partners (Tyr285 and Asn293) abolished C/EBPα binding activity. Val296 (Ala in most other bZIPs) contributes to C/EBPα specificity by discriminating against purines at position −3 and imposing steric restraints on the invariant Arg300. Mutating Val296 to Ala strongly enhanced C/EBPα binding to cAMP response element (CRE) sites while retaining affinity for C/EBP sites. Thus, Arg289 is essential for formation of the complementary protein-DNA interface, whereas Val296 functions primarily to restrict interactions with related sequences such as CRE sites rather than specifying binding to C/EBP sites.

Blood. 1997; 90: 489-519Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these functions, mice carrying a homozygous deletion of the C/EBPα gene die at birth due to energy imbalance caused by impaired glycogen storage in the liver and lack lipid accumulation in their adipose tissues (9Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). C/EBPα-deficient embyros also display a complete absence of mature neutrophils and increased numbers of immature myeloid progenitor cells (10Zhang D.E. Zhang P. Wang N.D. Hetherington C.J. Darlington G.J. Tenen D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the C/EBPα gene have been found in a subclass of human myeloid leukemias (11Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Zhang P. Radomska H.S. Narravula S. Schnittger S. Behre G. Hiddemann W. Tenen D.G. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 12Tenen D.G. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 688-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that loss of C/EBPα can contribute to the development of myeloid neoplasias by impairing the normal program of cellular differentiation and mitotic arrest (11Pabst T.

Leukemia. 2001; 15: 688-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). bZIP proteins function as transcriptional regulators in most or all eukaryotes (13Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) and can be arranged into several subfamilies, each recognizing a unique palindromic DNA motif (13Vinson C. Myakishev M. Acharya A. Mir A.A. Moll J.R. Bonovich M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6321-6335Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The canonical bZIP DNA-binding domain consists of a basic region juxtaposed to a sequence of heptad leucine repeats (the leucine zipper) (1Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar). bZIP basic regions show a high degree of sequence similarity and contain two invariant residues, Asn and Arg (Fig. 1). The bZIP-DNA complex consists of two α-helices lying perpendicular to the DNA, associated in a coiled-coil structure with each basic region contacting a half-site in the DNA major groove (1Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2525) Google Scholar, 14Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). A unique aspect of DNA recognition by bZIP proteins is that the helical fold of the basic region, which creates a surface complementary to the target DNA sequence, is induced upon association with the DNA ligand (15Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Patel L. Abate C. Curran T.

To date, x-ray structures of bZIP domain peptides bound to DNA have been determined for GCN4 (bound either to an AP-1 site (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C.

Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 20Keller W. Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar)), the Jun/Fos heterodimer (21Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar), CREB (22Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 7: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). These structures show that bZIPs recognize specific DNA sites through base contacts made by five residues within the basic region motif characteristic for each subfamily. These five positions are well conserved among all bZIP proteins and include the invariant Asn and Arg residues (Fig. 1). The invariant Asn contacts bases C3 and T−4 in the complexes of GCN4, Fos/Jun, and CREB with DNA (G1T2C3A4) (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar,20Keller W. Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol.

Shimizu T. Toda T. Yanagida M. Hakoshima T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, the bZIP structures have revealed functional variability of conserved residues in DNA recognition. Here we present the crystal structure of a C/EBPα bZIP polypeptide bound to its cognate DNA site. The structure reveals that two residues (Tyr285 and Arg289) located amino-terminally to the signature bZIP basic region motif are integral components of the protein-DNA interface. The functional significance of these residues was confirmed by analysis of substitution mutants. Arg289is conserved in AP-1 proteins but adopts a very different conformation; therefore, its importance for DNA binding in C/EBP proteins could not have been predicted from structures of other bZIP proteins nor was it indicated by previous mutagenesis studies. Finally, our data clarify the key role of Val296 in determining C/EBP binding specificity. This study thus provides the first detailed description of DNA recognition by a C/EBP family member. A protein containing residues 281–340 of rat C/EBPα was over-produced inEscherichia coli and purified as described previously (15Shuman J.D. Vinson C.R. McKnight S.L. Science. 1990; 249: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cloning appended the sequence Met-Gly-Ser to the amino terminus of the polypeptide; the terminal Met residue was removed in E. coli, resulting in a 62-amino acid product (Fig. 2A). DNA oligomers (Yale Keck Laboratory) were gel-purified. The crystallization strategy included trials with DNA duplexes of varying length and 5′ overhanging bases. The best diffracting cocrystals were obtained with a 21-mer DNA duplex (Fig. 2B). Crystals were grown at 4 °C in hanging drops prepared by mixing equal volumes of the protein-DNA complex (0.75 mm bZIP monomer and 0.5 mm DNA duplex in 50 mm NaCl, 100 mm MES, pH 5.7) and the precipitant solution (100 mm MES, pH 5.7, 100 mm NaCl, 30 mmMgCl2 ,18% polyethylene glycol 400, 10% glycerol) and were harvested for flash freezing directly from the mother liquor. Crystals belong to the P21212 space group with unit cell dimension a = 140.89 Å, b = 53.09 Å, and c = 67.41 Å. The solvent content of the crystals was estimated as 73% (24Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7909) Google Scholar). X-ray data were collected at 100 K, 1.07-Å wavelength on beamline X9B, National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratory, using the ADSC CCD Quantum-4 detector, and were processed with HKL2000 (25Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38432) Google Scholar) (Table I). The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the AMoRe package (26Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) with the truncated (residues 286 to 339 from chains A and C, −10 to +10 from chains B and D) polyalanine model derived from the CREB bZIP-DNA complex (22Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code: 1DH3). The asymmetric unit contains one protein-DNA complex. The DNA segments form a pseudo-continuous helix with base pair interactions between complementary 5′-overhanging bases from the adjacent complexes. The maximum likelihood target refinement was carried out with CNS_1.0 (27Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

The solution was first refined as three rigid groups: the coiled-coiled region and the basic region of each monomer with its DNA half-site. Subsequent cycles of simulated annealing refinement and model rebuilding with O, version 8.0 (28Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13005) Google Scholar) allowed localization of all missing residues (except the two derived from the expression vector) and fitting of most of the protein side chains and the DNA sequence. The orientation of the DNA backbone was determined based on the electron density corresponding to the asymmetric ends flanking the central palindromic sequence. Further refinement against all data with the correction for bulk solvent was followed by restrained thermal parameter refinement. Water molecules were added based on peak heights (≥3ς) in the difference Fourier map and proper hydrogen bond distance.

Open table in a new tab Specific amino acid changes were introduced into full-length rat C/EBPα or C/EBPβ (in pcDNA3.1) with the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For transactivation assays, 8 × 104 L929 cells were transfected with 1 μg of 2× C/EBP Luc or 2× CRE Luc reporter plasmids and 25 ng of C/EBPα or C/EBPβ expression plasmids using Fugene6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). A Renilla luciferase vector (pRLTK, Promega) was included to correct for transfection efficiency. After 48 h the cells were harvested, and lysates were prepared and assayed for reporter expression using the Dual Luciferase System (Promega). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized toRenilla luciferase, and the ratio for reporter alone was set to 1. Three experiments were averaged, and the data were graphed as the mean ± S.E. Proteins were expressed using the TnT Quick transcription/translation system (Promega). For Western blot analysis, 1 μl of each protein extract was separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed using C/EBPα or C/EBPβ antibodies (C-14 and C-19, respectively; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Secondary goat anti rabbit-horseradish peroxidase was used to visualize antigen-antibody with chemiluminescence (ECL, Pierce).

The complex consists of two polypeptides (residues 281–340) that form a dimer of α-helices associated with DNA in the well known fork-like structure (14Vinson C.R. Sigler P.B. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 246: 911-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar, 18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Residues 285–300 from each subunit comprise the recognition helix located in the major groove of each DNA half-site. The DNA duplex adopts a nearly straight B-type helix with an average rise per nucleotide of 3.3 Å. Residues 281–284 from the “extended basic region” characteristic of the C/EBP family (Fig. 2) do not participate in any intramolecular or DNA contacts and are highly mobile. The first contact between the two protein subunits is made via electrostatic interactions between the side chains of their Asn307 residues. The C/EBPα leucine zipper contains two hydrophilic residues, Thr310 and Asn321, at thed and a positions of the heptad repeat (Fig.2A), buried in the hydrophobic core of the coiled-coil dimer. The side chain hydroxyl oxygen of Thr310 from each chain can potentially form a hydrogen bond to Gln311 from the other subunit (Gln311′). Asn321 is conserved among many bZIP transcription factors and, as observed in GCN4 (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 19Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and CREB (22Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), its side chains form an inter-helical hydrogen bond. The dimer is stabilized by two salt links formed by the interaction of Asp320 with Arg325′ and Glu334 with Arg339′. Formation of equivalent salt bridges between the reciprocal pairs of subunits is prevented by crystal contact interactions. The two protein chains are bent by crystal packing forces. The complete chains superimpose with an r.m.s.d. of 2.03 Å for 118 Cα atom pairs, whereas for the leucine zippers the r.m.s.d. is 1.06 Å for superposition of 272 backbone atoms. The two basic regions immersed in the DNA major groove are very similar, the r.m.s.d. for superposition of the backbones of recognition helices together with all atoms of the corresponding DNA half-sites is 0.46 Å for 538 common atoms. Thus, the protein-DNA interface is not significantly affected by crystal packing. The boundaries of the C/EBPα-DNA interface are defined by Tyr285 and Arg300. Twelve amino acids from each recognition helix contact the DNA half-sites (Fig. 3A) essentially in a symmetrical manner. Eight of the side chains are potential proton donors in hydrogen bonds with phosphate oxygen atoms from the DNA backbone. Direct contacts with DNA bases are made by Arg289, Asn292, Ala295, Val296, Ser299, and Arg300 (Fig.3B). Details of the C/EBPα-DNA interface are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. The invariant Asn292 is positioned to make side chain hydrogen bond interactions with the O-4 atom of base T−4 and the N-6 amino group of base A3. Adenine at position 3 is also specified by Arg289, which contacts the N-7 atom of A3. Cβ atoms of Ala295 and Ser299 as well as Cγ2of Val296 make van der Waals contacts with the methyl group of T−4. An apolar environment for the 5-methyl group of T−3 is formed by atoms from the side chain of Val296 and the aliphatic portion of Arg300(Fig. 5A). The guanidinium group of Arg300 makes electrostatic interactions with G1 and G−2. Arg300 was modeled in one conformation in both subunits. However, weak electron density in this region of the second subunit (Arg300′) indicates that Arg300′ is perhaps disordered with a low occupancy in this conformation. Asymmetric contacts of the invariant Arg were also observed in the structure of CREB bound to a symmetric CRE site (22Schumacher M.A. Goodman R.H. Brennan R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Figure 4Architecture of the protein surface complementary to the cognate DNA.A, critical interactions in the C/EBPα protein-DNA interface.

Hydrophobic interaction of the methyl group from T2 and Ala occurring in GCN4 is marked by adotted line.

Particularly important in this respect is the buried side chain of Arg289, which can make bidentate hydrogen bonds with carboxylate oxygens from Asn292 and Asn293. In addition, the aliphatic portion of the Arg289 side chain makes extensive van der Waals contacts with the phenolic ring of Tyr285, whereas Val296 contacts the Cδ and Cγ atoms of Arg300 (Figs. 4A and5B). The conformation and functional roles in DNA recognition of Asn292, Ala295, and Ser299, residues that are conserved among bZIP proteins, are similar to those observed in GCN4 and CREB bound to CRE sites (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the ability of the invariant Arg300 residue to adopt the conformation seen in GCN4/CREB, where it contacts base G1 and DNA phosphate oxygen, is precluded by the proximity of Val296 (Fig. 5B). In this manner, Val296 enhances the preference for G−2 in the consensus CEBP binding site. However, the most striking difference between the C/EBPα and GCN4 structures is the conformation of Arg289 (Fig. 4). In AP-1 proteins, including Jun/Fos, this residue does not participate in specific base recognition (18Ellenberger T.E. Brandl C.J. Struhl K. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1992; 71: 1223-1237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 19Konig P. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 139-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 21Glover J.N.

Chem. 2000; 275: 35242-35247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the cluster of polar residues involving Arg289, Asn292, and Asn293 pushes base C2 away from the position occupied by T2in the GCN4 (Fig. 5C) and CREB (not shown) complexes and enforces movement of the DNA backbone away from the protein in this region. Because of this displacement, Val296 does not interact with base C2 and would accept thymine at position 2 of the half-site (see below). In AP-1 and CREB proteins, Ala occupies the position analogous to Val296 and specifies thymine at position 2 by hydrophobic contact with its methyl group (Fig.5C). Members of the PAP bZIP family recognize a half-site sequence (G1T2A3A4) that differs from the consensus C/EBP site only at position 2. In the structure of PAP1 bound to its cognate DNA, the invariant Asn adopts a different conformation from that seen in C/EBPα and GCN4 (Fig. 4B) and does not contact base A3 directly (23Fujii Y. Shimizu T. Toda T. Yanagida M. Hakoshima T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 889-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). PAP1 recognizes the A3·T−3 base pair in a very different manner than C/EBPα because of dissimilarities in their signature basic region sequences (Fig. 1). To test their functional roles, we mutated several basic region amino acids predicted from the structure to be important for C/EBP DNA recognition (Fig.6A). Tyr285, Arg289, and Val296 were converted to Ala and Asn293 was mutated to Arg, the corresponding residue in most AP-1 family members (Fig. 1). The mutations were introduced into full-length C/EBPα individually or in combination. Mutant proteins were first tested for their ability to activate transcription from a synthetic C/EBP-dependent reporter gene (2× C/EBP-luc) in L929 fibroblasts (Fig. 6B, left panel). Although wt C/EBPα stimulated 2× C/EBP-luc by ∼15-fold, most of the basic region mutations severely reduced or eliminated transactivation. The activities of Y285A, N293R, and Y285A/N293R were 5–6-fold lower than wt, whereas R289A was essentially inactive. Mutating the residue analogous to Tyr285 in C/EBPβ (Y226A) also severely reduced transactivation (Fig. 6B), indicating that the Tyr residue has an important functional role within the C/EBP family. Interestingly, changing Val296 to Ala did not impair transactivation of the C/EBP reporter and in fact caused a modest increase in activity. Similarly, the Y285A/N293R/V296A mutant was ∼4-fold more active than Y285A/N293R. Several of the substitution mutants contain amino acids that occur at the equivalent positions in AP-1 or CREB proteins (see Fig. 1). Therefore, we tested their ability to transactivate a CRE-dependent reporter gene, 2× CRE-luc (Fig. 6B, right panel). wt C/EBPα weakly activated 2× CRE-luc (∼3-fold), consistent with its low affinity for CRE sites. The Y285A, R289A, N293R, and Y285A/N293R mutants showed reduced activity. In marked contrast, V296A and Y285A/N293R/V296A activated the reporter by 9-fold and 7-fold, respectively. Thus, the V296A substitution significantly enhances the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate a CRE-driven promoter. We next examined the binding specificities of recombinant C/EBP proteins using the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig.6C). wt C/EBPα (lane 2) bound efficiently to the C/EBP probe but interacted very weakly with the CRE. R289A (lane 4) did not bind appreciably to either probe. Interaction of C/EBPα Y285A (lane 3) and N293R (lane 5) with both probes was also significantly reduced, as was C/EBPβ Y226A (lane 10). Y285A/N293R and Y285A/N293R/V296A bound poorly to the C/EBP site, whereas V296A activity was similar to wt C/EBPα. Strikingly, both mutants bearing the V296A substitution associated very efficiently with the CRE probe (lanes 6 and8). EMSA quantitation showed that the V296A substitution"
https://openalex.org/W2033255033,"Tyrosine kinases have been implicated in cellular processes thought to underlie learning and memory. Here we show that tyrosine kinases play a direct role in long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) and long-term memory (LTM) for sensitization in Aplysia. Tyrosine kinase activity is required for serotonin-induced LTF of sensorimotor (SN-MN) synapses, and enhancement of endogenous tyrosine kinase activity facilitates the induction of LTF. These effects are mediated, at least in part, through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and are blocked by transcriptional and translational inhibitors. Moreover, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also enhances the induction of LTF in a MAPK-dependent fashion. Finally, activation of endogenous tyrosine kinases enhances the induction of long-term memory for sensitization, and this enhancement also requires MAPK activation. Thus, tyrosine kinases, acting through MAPK, play a pivotal role in LTF and LTM formation."
https://openalex.org/W2035744678,"The DNA methylation pattern is an important component of the epigenome that regulates and maintains gene expression programs. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that vertebrate cells possess mechanisms protecting them from epigenomic stress similar to DNA damage checkpoints. We show that knockdown of DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase1) by an antisense oligonucleotide triggers an intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication that is not observed with control oligonucleotide. The cells are arrested at different positions throughout the S-phase of the cell cycle, suggesting that this response is not specific to distinct classes of origins of replication. The intra-S-phase arrest of DNA replication is proposed to protect the genome from extensive DNA demethylation that could come about by replication in the absence of DNMT1. This protective mechanism is not induced by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine, a nucleoside analog that inhibits DNA methylation by trapping DNMT1 in the progressing replication fork, but does not reduce de novosynthesis of DNMT1. Our data therefore suggest that the intra-S-phase arrest is triggered by a reduction in DNMT1 and not by demethylation of DNA. DNMT1 knockdown also leads to an induction of a set of genes that are implicated in genotoxic stress response such asNF-κB, JunB, ATF-3, and GADD45β (growth arrestDNA damage 45β gene). Based on these data, we suggest that this stress response mechanism evolved to guard against buildup of DNA methylation errors and to coordinate inheritance of genomic and epigenomic information.

One critical component of the epigenome is the pattern of distribution of methylated cytosines in CG dinucleotide sequences in the genome (1Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Methylation of CGs marks genes for inactivation by either interfering with the binding of methylated DNA-sensitive transcription factors (2Prendergast G.C. Ziff E.B. Science. 1991; 251: 186-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) or by recruiting methylated DNA-binding proteins such as MeCP2, which in turn recruit corepressor complexes and histone deacetylases to the chromatin associated with the gene (3Nan X. Ng H.H. Johnson C.A. Laherty C.D. Turner B.M. Eisenman R.N. Bird A. Nature. 1998; 393: 386-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). The methylation pattern can thus determine the chromatin structure and state of activity of genes. Disruption in the proper maintenance of the DNA methylation pattern results in aberrant gene expression, as is observed in tumor suppressor genes that are hypermethylated in cancer (4Merlo A. Herman J.G. Mao L. Lee D.J. Gabrielson E. Burger P.C. Baylin S.B. Sidransky D. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Aberrant hypomethylation can also result in improper activation of genes (5Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). The main enzyme responsible for replicating the DNA methylation pattern is DNMT1 (DNA methyltransferase1). This enzyme shows preference for hemimethylated DNA and is therefore believed to faithfully copy the DNA methylation pattern (6Gruenbaum Y. Cedar H. Razin A. Nature. 1982; 295: 620-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to coordinate the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns with DNA replication. First, DNMT1 expression is regulated with the cell cycle (7Detich N. Ramchandani S. Szyf M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10105-10112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Second, DNMT1 is localized to the replication fork (14Leonhardt H. Page A.W. Weier H.U. Bestor T.H. Cell. 1992; 71: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and is associated with the replication protein proliferating cell nuclear antigen (15Chuang L.S. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Third, DNA methylation occurs concurrently with DNA replication (16Araujo F.D. Knox J.D. Szyf M. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3475-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This temporal and physical association of DNMT1 with DNA replication is believed to have evolved to guarantee concordant replication of DNA and its methylation pattern. Previous studies have shown that inhibition of DNMT1 can lead to inhibition of initiation of DNA replication (17Knox J.D. Araujo F.D. Bigey P. Slack A.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17986-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but it is not clear whether this response is a consequence of induction of tumor suppressor genes such as p21 (18Milutinovic S. Knox J.D. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6353-6359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) or p16 (19Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), leading to retreat from the cell cycle. A conditional knockout of murine dnmt1 gene was also shown to reduce the rate of cell division (5Jackson-Grusby L. Beard C. Possemato R. Tudor M. Fambrough D. Csankovszki G. Dausman J. Lee P. Wilson C. Lander E. Jaenisch R. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), but it is still unclear whether inhibition of DNMT1 leads to a change in cell cycle kinetics similar to DNA damage response checkpoints. Multiple mechanisms have been established to guard the integrity of the genome in response to DNA damage. For example, two parallel, cooperating mechanisms, both regulated by ATM, jointly contribute to the rapid and transient inhibition of firing of origins of DNA replication in response to ionizing radiation (20Kastan M.B. Lim D.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21Falck J. Mailand N. Syljuasen R.G. Bartek J. Lukas J.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6006-6016Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). This stalling of DNA synthesis is required to prevent genetic instability by coordinating replication and repair. We reasoned that similar mechanisms guard the integrity of epigenomic information in response to a disruption in the DNA methylation machinery. In this paper, we test this hypothesis by determining the response of human cell lines to a knockdown of DNMT1 mRNA, encoding the enzyme responsible for the replication of the DNA methylation pattern. Our data suggest that cells respond to this epigenomic stress by an intra-S-phase arrest of DNA synthesis as well as by inducing a large number of stress response genes. The slow down in DNA synthesis during S-phase protects the DNA from a global loss of the methylation pattern. This mechanism is not triggered by 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR),1 which causes an extensive loss of DNA methylation. Both A549, a human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line, and T24, a human bladder transitional carcinoma-derived cell line, were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. T24 cells were maintained in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. 18–24 h prior to treatment, cells were plated at a concentration of 3 × 105 cells/100-mm tissue culture dish or 5 × 104 cells/well in a six-well plate in the absence of antibiotics. The phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides used in this study were MG88 (human DNMT1 antisense oligonucleotide) and its mismatch control MG208, which has a 6-base pair difference from MG88 (19Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were transfected into cells with 6.25 μg/ml Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in serum-free Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). The oligonucleotide-containing Opti-MEM medium was removed from the cells and replaced with regular growth medium after 4 h. The treatment was repeated every 24 h. The cells were harvested 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following the first transfection. For 5-aza-CdR treatment, cells were grown in regular culture medium in the presence of 10−6m 5-aza-CdR (Sigma) dissolved in Me2SO. The 5-aza-CdR-containing medium was freshly replaced every 24 h. To determine the level of cellular DNA methyltransferase activity, nuclear extracts were prepared, and DNA methyltransferase activity was assayed as described previously (8Szyf M. Bozovic V. Tanigawa G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10027-10030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of DNMT1, 50 μg of nuclear protein was fractionated on a 5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and reacted with the polyclonal anti-DNMT1 antibody (New England Biolabs) at a dilution of 1:2000 in the presence of 0.05% Tween and 5% milk, and it was then reacted with anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:5000. The amount of total protein per lane was determined by Amido Black staining (23Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von H.E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The intensity of DNMT1 and total protein signal was measured by scanning densitometry, and the ratio of DNMT1/total nuclear protein was calculated. Total RNA was extracted using the standard guanidium isothiocyanate method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63222) Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized in a 20-μl reaction volume containing 2 μg of total RNA, 40 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (MBI), 5 μmrandom primer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a 1 mmconcentration of each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). mRNA was denatured for 5 min at 70 °C, the random primers were annealed for 10 min at 25 °C, and mRNA was reverse transcribed for 1 h at 37 °C. The reverse transcriptase was heat-inactivated for 10 min at 70 °C, and the products were stored at −20 °C until use. PCR was performed in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 3 μl of synthesized cDNA product, 5 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 1.5–2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dNTP, 1 unit ofTaq polymerase (all from MBI) and 0.5 μm of each primer. The primer sequences that were used for the different mRNAs were GADD45β (growth arrestDNA damage 45β gene) (sense, 5′-GTGTACGAGTCGGCCAAGTT-3′; antisense, 5′-AGGAGACAATGCAGGTCTCG-3′); ATF-3 (sense, 5′-AAGAGCTGAGGTTTGCCATC-3′; antisense, 5′-GACAGCTCTCCAATGGCTTC-3′); JunB (sense, 5′-TGGAACAGCCCTTCTACCAC-3′; antisense, 5′-GGAGTAGCTGCTGAGGTTGGT-3′); β-actin (sense, 5′-GTTGCTAGCCAGGCTGTGCT-3′; antisense, 5′-CGGATGTCCACGTCACACTT-3′); MAGEB2 (sense, 5′-AGCGAGTGTAGGGGGTGCG-3′; antisense, 5′-TGAGGCCCTCAGAGGCTTTC-3′); BCL2-interacting killer (BIK) (sense, 5′-GGCCTGCTGCTGTTATCTTT-3′; antisense, 5′-CCAGTAGATTCTTTGCCGAG-3′); SSX2 (sense, 5′-CAGAGTACGCACGGTCTGAT-3′; antisense, 5′-GATTCCCACGGTTAGGGTCA-3′). Amplifications were performed in a Biometra T3 thermocycler (Biomedizinische Analytik GmbH) using the following programs: for GADD45β, first cycle 94 °C for 3 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, second cycle 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by 37 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 54 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; for ATF-3 and JunB, an initial cycle of 94 °C for 3 min 60 °C for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 34 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 58 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; for β-actin, first cycle 94 °C for 3 min, 64 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, second cycle 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min; for MAGEB2, BIK, and SSX2, first cycle 94 °C for 30 s, 62 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, second cycle 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s. The numbers of cycles were selected and tested so that the PCR amplification remained in the linear phase. 10 μl of the PCR products were applied on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Densitometric analysis was performed using Scion Imaging Software (Scion Inc., Frederick, MD). Total RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed as described above in the presence of 12.5 μCi of 35S-labeled dCTP (1250 Ci/mmol) (ICN) to quantify the efficiency of reverse transcription. Equal amounts of reverse transcribed cDNA (70,000 cpm as determined by the incorporation of 35S-labeled dCTP) were subjected to PCR amplification in the presence of increasing concentrations of a competitor DNA fragment that amplifies with the same set of primers but yields a product that is shorter by 48 base pairs. The following primers were used: 5′-ACCGCTTCTACTTCCTCGAGGCCTA-3′ (DNMT1 sense), 5′-GTTGCAGTCCTCTGTGAACACTGTGG-3′(DNMT1 antisense), and 5′-CGTCGAGGCCTAGAAACAAAGGGAAGGGCAAG (primer used to generate the competitor). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min, 65 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (33 cycles). Genomic DNA was extracted with DNA extraction buffer (1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl) followed by proteinase K digestion, phenol/chloroform extractions and ethanol precipitations. Bisulfate treatment was performed as described previously (25Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). The methylation status of the p16gene was determined by methylation-specific PCR (26Herman J.G. Graff J.R. Myohanen S. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9821-9826Crossref PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar) as modified by Palmisano et al. (27Palmisano W.A. Divine K.K. Saccomanno G. Gilliland F.D. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Belinsky S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5954-5958PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were plated in a six-well plate (5 × 104/well). For the final 4 h of incubation, 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3-3H]thymidine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the medium. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated in 10% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min at 4 °C, washed twice with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid, and then lysed with 1 n NaOH and 1% SDS. [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (LKB Wallac). Global DNA methylation was evaluated by staining the cells with specific monoclonal antibody against 5-methylcytidine using the protocol described previously (28Habib M. Fares F. Bourgeois C.A. Bella C. Bernardino J. Hernandez-Blazquez F. de C.A. Niveleau A. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 249: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% bovine serum albumin (PBST-BSA), fixed with 0.25% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C for 10 min and 88% methanol at −20 °C for at least 30 min. After two washes with PBST-BSA, the cells were treated with 2 n HCl at 37 °C for 30 min and were then neutralized with 0.1 m sodium borate (pH 8.5). The cells were blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBST-BSA for 20 min at 37 °C, incubated with anti-5-methylcytidine antibody (1 μg/ml) for 45 min at 37 °C, followed by staining with donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Rhodamine Red-X (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Finally, the cells were washed with PBS three times and were resuspended in PBS for flow cytometry analysis. A549 cells were transfected with 200 nm MG208 or MG88 or were treated with 1 μm5-aza-CdR or Me2SO, for 48 h. Total RNA was extracted with RNAeasy (Qiagen). Micoarray analysis was performed as previously described (29Golub T.R. Slonim D.K. Tamayo P. Huard C. Gaasenbeek M. Mesirov J.P. Coller H. Loh M.L. Downing J.R. Caligiuri M.A. Bloomfield C.D. Lander E.S. Science. 1999; 286: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (9252) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis, followed by in vitro transcription with a T7 promoter primer having a poly(T) tail. The resulting product was hybridized and processed with the GeneChip system (Affymetrix) to a HuGeneFL DNA microarray containing oligonucleotides specific for ∼12,000 human transcripts. Data analysis, average difference, and expression for each feature on the chip were computed using Affymetrix GeneChip Analysis Suite version 3.3 with default parameters. The gene expression analysis was performed by the Montreal Genome Center. Cells were incubated with 10 μm BrdUrd (Sigma) for the last 2 h before harvesting. Incorporated BrdUrd was stained with anti-BrdUrd antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's protocol (30Vanderlaan M. Thomas C.B. Cytometry. 1985; 6: 501-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After the last washing, the cells were resuspended in PBS containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide and 10 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature and then analyzed with FACScan (BD Bioscience) for both fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide fluorescence. DNMT1 activity is physically and temporally associated with the DNA replication machinery. The absence of DNMT1 from the replication fork could potentially lead to an epigenomic catastrophe. We have previously proposed that the coordination of DNMT1 expression and DNA replication evolved as a mechanism to protect the coordinate inheritance of genetic and epigenetic information (31Szyf M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 350-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 32Szyf M. Front. Biosci. 2001; 6: D599-D609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, we determined the cellular response to a knockdown of DNMT1 protein. We took advantage of a previously described antisense oligonucleotide, which specifically knocks down DNMT1mRNA (19Fournel M. Sapieha P. Beaulieu N. Besterman J.M. MacLeod A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24250-24256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) MG88 and its mismatch control MG208 (see Fig.1A for sequence and alignment with human and mouse DNMT1 mRNA). We first optimized the time and concentration at which MG88 specifically knocks down DNMT1activity in A549 cells in comparison with MG208. The results presented in Fig. 1B show that MG88 reduces DNA methyltransferase activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner relative to MG208. Inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity approximates 80% after 48 h of MG88 treatment, whereas no inhibition is observed following MG208 treatment. Therefore, for our further analysis we chose to treat the cells with a 200 nm concentration of either MG88 or MG208 for 48 h. We confirmed the antisense mechanism of action of MG88 by demonstrating that DNMT1mRNA levels are knocked down following a 48-h treatment with this oligonucleotide in comparison with MG208 treatment using a competitive RT-PCR assay for DNMT1 (Fig. 1, C andD). To confirm that DNMT1 inhibition results in reduction of DNMT1 protein, nuclear extracts prepared from either MG208- or MG88-treated cells (200 nm for 48 h) were subjected to a Western blot analysis and reacted with anti-DNMT1 antibody (Fig.1E). Quantification of the signal by densitometry reveals 85% reduction in protein levels. Inhibition of DNMT1mRNA by MG88 was also confirmed in a gene array expression analysis presented in Table II.Table IIStress-responsive genes up-regulated by MG88 after 48 h of treatmentRatioGenBank™ accession no.NameAbbreviated name17.6AF078077Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible, βGADD45β15.1M59465Tumor necrosis factor, α-induced protein 3TNFAIP312.1S76638Nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 2 (p49/p100)NFKB211.6L19871Activating transcription factor 3ATF-39.1J04111v-jun avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homologJUN9.1U19261Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 1TRAF17.4U72206Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2ARHGEF27.1J04111v-jun avian sarcoma virus 17 oncogene homologJUN6.9U10550GTP-binding protein overexpressed in skeletal muscleGEM6.9V01512v-fos FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homologFOS6.2M58603Nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 1 (p105)NFKB16.0L49169FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog BFOSB5.8M59287CDC-like kinase1CLK15.6M60974Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, alphaGADD45α5.5L36463Ras inhibitorRIN15.3M69043Nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells inhibitor, αNFKB1A5.2X51345junB proto-oncogeneJUNB4.8D87116Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3MAP2K34.5AF059617Serum-inducible kinaseSNK4.1S82240ras homolog gene family, member EARHE3.8AB014551Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factor 2ARHGEF23.7X61498Nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells 2 (p49/p100)NFKB23.6U83981Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 34GADD343.6AF050110TGFB-inducible early growth responseTIEG3.2AB011093Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor p114P114-RHO-GEF3.1S81439TGFB-inducible early growth responseTIEG3.1AI304854Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27, Kip1)CDKN1B2.9M62831Immediate early proteinETR1012.9U03106Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1)CDKN1A2.9L08246Myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (BCL2-related)MCL12.8X52560CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein, βCEBPB2.8M36820GRO2oncogeneGRO22.8AF093265Homer, neuronal immediate early gene, 3HOMER-32.7AI038821v-Ha-ras Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologHRAS2.7AF016266Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 10bTNFRSF10B2.6X82260Ran GTPase-activating protein 1RANGAP12.6D87953N-mycdownstream-regulatedNDRG12.5X54489GRO1 oncogene (melanoma growth stimulating activity, α)GRO12.5L20320Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (homolog of Xenopus MO15 Cdk-activating kinase)CDK7−3.4X63692DNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase 1DNMT1A549 cells were transfected with 200 nm of either MG208 or MG88 for 48 h.

The second column lists the accession numbers of the genes. The third column lists the names of the genes, and the last column provides their abbreviated names. Several studies have previously demonstrated that inhibition of DNMT1 results in inhibition of cell growth (33Bigey P. Knox J.D. Croteau S. Bhattacharya S.K. Theberge J. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4594-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for the reduced cell growth is that knockdown of DNMT1 results in inhibition of firing of DNA replication origins (17Knox J.D. Araujo F.D. Bigey P. Slack A.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17986-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed the question of whether this inhibition of DNA replication reflects a distinct alteration in cell cycle kinetics, similar to the DNA damage checkpoints that trigger arrest at distinct phases of the cell cycle (34Bartek J. Lukas J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 738-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). A549 cells were treated with a 200 nm concentration of either MG88 or MG208 for 24–96 h as described under “Materials and Methods.” As observed in Fig. 2,DNMT1 knockdown results in a significant decrease in overall DNA synthetic capacity of A549 cells. This is illustrated by the reduced incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA 24 h after the initiation of treatment, as has been previously reported (17Knox J.D. Araujo F.D. Bigey P. Slack A.D. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17986-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that inhibition of DNA synthesis by MG88 is independent of DNMT1 expression and is a toxic side effect of the sequence, we took advantage of the species specificity of MG88. As shown in Fig. 1A, there is a 6-base pair mismatch between MG88 and the mouse dnmt1 mRNA. We therefore determined whether MG88 would inhibit DNA synthesis in a mouse adrenal carcinoma cell line, Y1, which was previously shown by us to be responsive to a mouse dnmt1 antisense oligonucleotide (23Ramchandani S. MacLeod A.R. Pinard M. von H.E. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 684-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The results shown in Fig. 2B demonstrate that 48-h treatment with 200 nm MG88 had no significant impact on the DNA synthetic capacity of Y1 cells in comparison with MG208, supporting the hypothesis that MG88 inhibition of DNA synthesis is DNMT1-dependent. We then addressed the question of whether this inhibition in DNA synthesis represents a slowdown in the rate of DNA synthesis or a reduction in the fraction of cells that are in the synthetic phase, which would indicate a change in cell cycle phase kinetics. We pulsed MG88- and MG208-treated cells with BrdUrd 48 h after the initiation of treatment and sorted the cells that incorporated BrdUrd using fluorescence-activated cell sorting as described under “Materials and Methods.” As illustrated in Fig. 2C, DNMT1 knockdown reduces the fraction of cells that incorporate DNA (the M1 population). However, the reduction in the fraction of cells that synthesize DNA (up to 42%) does not account for the overall reduction in DNA replication shown by the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, which is >95%. Although there is no significant cell death that can account for this disparity, this difference might reflect the fact that cell number following MG88 treatment is reduced. The reduction in the fraction of cells that incorporate DNA could be a consequence of a phase specific cell cycle arrest. However, preliminary results using flow cytometry sorting of propidium iodide-stained cells failed to"

Upon examining the molecular mechanisms, we found that Smad4, a common signal transducer in the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)/transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathway, functions as a transcription corepressor for human estrogen receptor α (ERα). Endogenous ERα was co-immunoprecipitated with Smad4, and the interaction was induced by antiestrogen ligands such as tamoxifen, raloxifene, and droloxifen, which was confirmed in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Smad4 and ERα form a complex when ERα binds to the estrogen-responsive element within the estrogen target gene promoter. Importantly, the expression of Smad4 inhibits both antiestrogen-induced luciferase activity and estrogen downstream target gene transcription in breast cancer cells. Mapping of the interaction domains indicates that the activation function 1 (AF1) domain of ERα is essential for its interaction with Smad4, while the MH1 domain and linker region of Smad4 are essential for the interaction. Our findings represent a novel mechanism that TGF-β may regulate cell fate through Smad4-mediated cross-talk with estrogen.

These cofactors may function as molecular gates to enable integration of diverse signal transduction pathways at nuclear receptor-regulated promoters (27McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). A relatively new class of synthetic drugs known as selective estrogen receptor modulators or SERMs are currently in use for treatment of osteoporosis, breast cancer, and other hormone-dependent medical disorders (3Osborne C.K. Zhao H. Fuqua S.A. J. Clin. Oncol. 2000; 18: 3172-3186Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). SERMs exhibit a wide range of estrogen-like and antiestrogen actions based on the target tissue being studied (28Black L.J. Sato M. Rowley E.R. Magee D.E. Bekele A. Williams D.C. Cullinan G.J.

For example, tamoxifen is an ER antagonist in breast tissue (29Jordan V.C. Cancer. 1992; 70: 977-982PubMed Google Scholar) but an ER agonist in bone (30Love R.R. Mazess R.B. Barden H.S. Epstein S.

Raloxifene, a compound related to tamoxifen, is also an ER antagonist in breast tissue; however, it exerts agonist activity in bone but not uterine tissue (28Black L.J. Sato M. Rowley E.R. Magee D.E.

It has been believed that novel and as yet unidentified cofactors bind to the antiestrogen-modulated ER and are responsible for the observed tissue-specific activity (10Shang Y. Brown M. Science. 2002; 295: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). In contrast to estrogen promotion of the development of breast cancer, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) is known to inhibit the growth of mammary epithelial cells and may play a protective role in mammary carcinogenesis (32Akhurst R.J. Derynck R. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S44-S51PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). TGF-β is the prototypic autocrine or paracrine inhibitor of cell cycle progression in epithelial cells and appears to directly antagonize the effects of many different mitogenic growth factors (33Massague J.

TGF-β1 inhibition of ERα transcription expression occurs within 3 h in MCF-7 breast cancer cells (49Stoica A. Saceda M. Fakhro A. Solomon H.B. Fenster B.D. Martin M.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These data suggest that cross-talk between estrogen receptors and TGF-β signaling is critical in breast cancer development. The signaling responses to TGF-βs are mediated by their intracellular substrates, the Smad proteins (34Massague J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar, 50Watanabe T. Inoue S. Hiroi H. Orimo A. Kawashima H. Muramatsu M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 442-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Upon ligand binding, the activated receptors directly phosphorylate regulatory Smads (R-Smads). Phosphorylated R-Smads interact with Smad4, and the complex translocates into the nucleus to regulate gene transcription. Smad4 is the common signaling molecule shared in the TGF-β superfamily. Smad4/DPC4 is also known as a tumor suppressor (37Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E.

Shitara N. Iwama T. Utsunomiya J. Kuroki T. Mori T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3098-3103Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and other tumors. Oncogene Jab1 mediates the degradation of Smad4 (51Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad4 all have physical interactions with ERα and might be important for TGF-β regulation of ERα signaling (52Matsuda T. Yamamoto T. Muraguchi A. Saatcioglu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42908-42914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 53Yamamoto T. Saatcioglu F. Matsuda T. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Among these Smads, Smad3 and Smad4 have also been studied in another steroid receptor, the androgen receptor, and androgen receptor-mediated signaling and important functions have been suggested (54Kang H.Y. Huang K.E. Chang S.Y. Ma W.L. Lin W.J. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43749-43756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the possible significance of Smad4 in estrogen signaling has not been well assessed, and the detailed mechanism of the cross-talk is not clear. In this study, we examined the potential role of Smad4 in estrogen signaling. We demonstrate that Smad4 interacts with ERα in vivo and represses estrogen-induced transcriptional activity mediated through the ERE. Smad4 is incorporated in the ERα-DNA complex and might recruit other corepressors to the complex. Finally, we show that Smad4 strongly inhibits the transcription of various downstream genes of estrogen signaling. These findings suggest that TGF-β may regulate cell fate through Smad4-mediated cross-talk with estrogen and may provide a molecular basis to explain the wide range of SERM-mediated, tissue-selective effects in breast cancer patients. In the yeast two-hybrid assay, we cloned the full-length Smad4 coding sequence into pGBT9 (Clontech) to generate the pGBT9-Smad4 bait plasmid in which Smad4 is fused with the Gal4 DNA binding domain. Likewise, the human ERα was cloned into pACT2 (Clontech) and fused with the VP16 activation domain (pACT2-hERα). The HA-tagged human ERα expression plasmid was cloned into a pCDNA3 vector linked with HA at the amino terminus by PCR using pRST7-ERα (a gift from the National Institutes of Health) as the template. The AF1 (E2), AF1 + DNA binding domain (DBD) (E1), DBD + AF2 (E3), and AF2 (E4) domains of ERα were cloned into the same pCDNA3 vector by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion in BamHI and XhoI sites. An estrogen-response element-containing reporter (3× ERE-TATA) was a gift from Dr. Valerie Clack (Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC). The FLAG-tagged Smad4 expression plasmid was a gift from Dr. Rik Derynk (University of California, San Francisco, CA). We cloned the MH1, MH1 + linker, linker, MH2 + linker, and MH2 domains of Smad4 into a pCMV5 vector linked with FLAG at the carboxyl terminus by PCR. COS-1 cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. MCF-7 and T47D cells were bought from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. According to the manufacturer's instruction (Clontech) and previous work (51Wan M. Cao X. Wu Y. Bai S. Wu L. Shi X. Wang N. Cao X. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the interaction was quantified by a liquid β-galactosidase assay when ERα and Smad4 were coexpressed. pACT2 and pGBT9 vectors were also examined as negative controls. The stimulation of β-galactosidase activity indicates interaction between these two overexpressed proteins. COS-1 cells were split and plated at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and starved with phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) for 24 h. HA-tagged hERα was cotransfected with FLAG-tagged Smad4 into COS-1 cells using Tfx-50 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). The cells were treated with different ligands as follows: 1 nm β-estradiol (E2); 100 nmtamoxifen (Tam); 10 nm raloxifene (Ral); 10 nmdroloxifen (Dro); 2 ng/μl TGF-β1; or an ethanol (EtOH) vehicle (control) for 24 h. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were lysed with 0.6 ml radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mmNaCl) with freshly added inhibitors (0.01 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.01 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) was added into the 0.2-ml cell lysate of the protein samples and rotated at 4 °C for 3 h. The protein complexes were immunoprecipitated by protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and the samples were loaded and run in a 7% SDS-PAGE gel. The precipitates were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted by anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody). Likewise, the immunoprecipitation was also done with anti-HA polyclonal antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. The truncated HA-hERα or FLAG-Smad4 expression plasmids were also transfected into COS-1 cells, and co-immunoprecipitation was done with the same method. MCF-7 or T47D cells were split and plated at 80% confluence per 100-mm dish and starved with RPMI 1640 phenol red-free medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) for 24 h. The aliquots of cells were treated with ligands and lysed in 0.6 ml of RIPA buffer (with freshly added inhibitors) 24 h after treatment. Anti-Smad4 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to 0.5-ml cell lysates for the immunoprecipitation, and the immunoblotting was done with anti-hERα polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To identify the function of Smad4 on estrogen response element, 2× ERE-TATA was used as the reporter plasmid. MCF-7 cells were split and plated at 5 × 104 cells per 24-well plate and starved with RPMI 1640 phenol red-free medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Cellgro) for 24 h. The cells were transfected using Tfx-50 with 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter and 20 ng of the hERα expression plasmid. 50 ng of Smad4 expression plasmid or empty vector was also cotransfected. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the aliquots of cells were treated with one of the ligands, i.e.E2, Tam, Ral, Dro, and TGF-β1 or vehicle. Luciferase activities were assayed 48 h after transfection using the Dual-LuciferaseTM assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Firefly luciferase activity was assayed and normalized against Renilla luciferase activity. Luciferase values shown in the figures are representative of transfection experiments performed in triplicate from at least three independent experiments. The standard deviations are shown in vertical lines. The expression plasmids of human ERα and Smad4 were cotransfected into COS-1 cells. Forty-eight hours after the transfection, the transfected cell lysate and an aliquot of non-transfected cell lysate were collected and incubated with radiolabeled ERE, which is the probe in gel-shift assays. The ERE DNA oligomers were radiolabeled by a kinase reaction with a DNA polymerase I large (Klenow) fragment and [α-32P]dCTP. Binding reactions were preincubated for 20 min at 22 °C with indicated lysates in 75 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 6% of bovine serum albumin, and 25 ng of poly(dIdC) in a volume of 19 μl. One microliter of DNA probe (0.5 ng, 50,000–100,000 cpm) was added to each of the reactions. The reactions were subjected to nondenaturing electrophoresis on a 4% polyacrylamide gel. The MCF-7 cells were grown to 95% confluences in phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum for at least 3 days. Following the addition of ligands for 3 h, cells were washed and lysed according to the protocol from Dr. Myles Brown (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with specific antibodies against ERα or Smad4. The precipitates were extracted and heated as described (55Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1457) Google Scholar). For PCR, (the sequences of specific primers were given as a gift from Dr. Myles Brown) 1 μl from a 50-μl DNA extraction and 21–25 cycles of amplification were used. A fluorescence signal from each real time quantitative PCR reaction (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) is collected as normalized values plotted versus the cycle number. Reactions are characterized by comparing threshold cycle (C(t)) values. The C(t) is a value defined by the fractional cycle number at which the sample fluorescence signal passes a fixed threshold above base. Quantitative values are obtained from the C(t) numbers at which the increase in signal associated with an exponential growth of PCR product starts to be detected (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's manual. The β-actin gene is used as a control for the endogenous RNA transcripts, and each sample was normalized by its β-actin content. The final result is expressed as relative fold by comparing the amount of RNA of target gene to the β-actin gene, which is determined by the equation 2−(C(t)target −C(t)β-actin). The target cDNA sequence was evaluated using Primer3 (www.genome.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi). The sequences of primers are listed as follows: β-actin upper primer, 5′-AGA CTT CGA GCA GGA GAT GG-3′; β-actin lower primer, 5′-CGG ATG TCA ACG TCA CAC TT-3′; CATD upper primer, 5′-TCT GTG GAG GAC CTG ATT GC-3′; CATD lower primer, 5′-AGG TTG GAG GAG CCC GTG T-3′; EBAG9 upper primer, 5′-CGT CGG CTT GTA TAA CCT-3′; and EBAG9 lower primer, 5′-TTA ATT TCC GTC CTC TGC-3′. The forward and reverse primers were designed to flank at least one intron to prevent amplification of genomic DNA that may be contained in samples. Total RNA was extracted from T47D cells by using STAT-60 (TEL-TEST Inc.). The quality of the RNA samples was determined by electrophoresis through agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide. The 18 and 28 S RNA bands were visualized under UV light. Equal amounts of total RNA were reverse-transcribed to cDNA by TaqMan® Reverse Transcription Reagents (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed using the SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The amplification reactions were performed in 25 μl of final volume containing 1× SYBR buffer, 0.4 μm primer mixture, and 3 μl cDNA. To reduce variability between replicates, PCR premixes, which contain all reagents except for cDNA, were prepared and aliquoted into 0.2-ml thin-wall strip tubes (MJ Research, Cambridge, MA). The thermal cycling conditions comprised an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 cycles at 95 °C for 30s and 60 °C for 1min. For each set of primers, PCR thermal cycle conditions have been optimized to achieve single band PCR product in 1% agarose gel with ethidium bromide staining. Experiments were performed with duplicates for each data point. All of the PCR reactions were performed using OPTICONTM DNA Engine (MJ Research). To study the potential cross-talk between estrogen receptor and Smads, we first examined the interaction between Smad4 and ERα in a yeast two-hybrid system because Smad4/DPC4 has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor (37Hahn S.A. Schutte M. Hoque A.T. Moskaluk C.A. da Costa L.T. Rozenblum E. Weinstein C.L. Fischer A. Yeo C.J. Hruban R.H. Kern S.E. Science. 1996; 271: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2176) Google Scholar). Human ERα was cloned into the pACT2 plasmid, and human Smad4 was cloned into the pGBT9 plasmid. β-galactosidase activity was stimulated when both ERα and Smad4 were expressed (Fig.1A), indicating Smad4 interaction with ERα in yeast. To examine the physical interaction in mammalian cells, we performed a coimmunoprecipitation experiment in COS-1 cells. HA-tagged ERα and FLAG-tagged Smad4 were cotransfected into COS-1 cells in the presence of different ligands. The interaction was detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA polyclonal antibody (Fig.1B). We confirmed the result by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody followed by immunoblotting with an anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 1C). The interaction was independent of β-estradiol E2 and antiestrogen ligands in both assays. To further confirm the endogenous protein interaction between Smad4 and ERα in breast cancer cells, co-immunoprecipitation"

By using primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack Arf, p53, or both, we studied the involvement of the p19Arf-p53 pathway in the regulation of cell motility and its relationship with Rho GTPases. Deletion of Arf and/or p53 led to actin cytoskeleton reorganization and a significant increase in cell motility. The endogenous phosphoinositide (PI) 3- kinase and Rac1 activities were elevated in Arf−/− andp53−/− cells, and these activities are required for p19Arf- and p53-regulated migration. Reintroduction of the wild type Arf or p53genes into Arf−/− orp53−/− cells reversed the PI 3-kinase and Rho GTPase activities as well as the migration phenotype. These results suggest a functional relationship between an established tumor suppressor pathway and a signaling module that controls actin structure and cell motility and show that p19Arf and p53 negatively regulate cell migration by suppression of PI 3-kinase and Rac1 activities.

The endogenous phosphoinositide (PI) 3- kinase and Rac1 activities were elevated in Arf−/− andp53−/− cells, and these activities are required for p19Arf- and p53-regulated migration. Reintroduction of the wild type Arf or p53genes into Arf−/− orp53−/− cells reversed the PI 3-kinase and Rho GTPase activities as well as the migration phenotype. These results suggest a functional relationship between an established tumor suppressor pathway and a signaling module that controls actin structure and cell motility and show that p19Arf and p53 negatively regulate cell migration by suppression of PI 3-kinase and Rac1 activities. The p53 and pRb cell cycle inhibitors and their regulators, including p19Arf and p27Kip1, are well established tumor suppressors that are components of a complex signaling network central to tumor suppression (1Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation in these tumor suppressors or their regulators occurs in the majority of tumor cases and correlates with the onset of a wide spectrum of cancer (2Hahn W.C. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Specifically the p19Arf-p53 tumor suppressor pathway is thought to be involved primarily in monitoring proliferation signals to prevent cells from uncontrolled growth (3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Rho family small GTPases, on the other hand, are molecular switches that transduce diverse intracellular signals leading to cell proliferation, gene induction, apoptosis, and in particular, cytoskeleton remodeling and migration (4Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5200) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence has implicated the Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, in many aspects of tumor development, including tumor cell migration and proliferation (5Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). Many mitogenic signals, including those from growth factor receptors and integrins, can promote the exchange of GDP for GTP on Rho GTPases, enabling them to interact with an array of effector targets to elicit cytoskeletal changes (6Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 7Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). Although much of the attention in tumor suppressor studies has been focused on their roles in cell cycle control and/or apoptosis, preliminary evidence has become available suggesting a potential functional linkage between p53 and cell morphological effect/cell motility. For example, p53 has been shown to regulate the transcription of a number of genes involved in cell morphology and/or movement, including that of smooth muscle α-actin (8Comer K.A. Dennis P.A.

Moreover, overexpression of p53 seems to cause a partial reversion of Ras-induced morphological transformation (13Gloushankova N. Ossovskaya V. Vasiliev J. Chumakov P. Kopnin B. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2985-2989Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and to inhibit cell migration (14Alexandrova A. Ivanov A. Chumakov P. Vasiliev J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A recent study further suggests that p53 may have a role in Cdc42-mediated filopodia formation and cell polarization (15Gadea G. Lapasset L. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Roux P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional connection between the tumor suppressors and Rho GTPase-regulated cytoskeleton events, we have examined the actin cytoskeletal structure and migration capability of p19Arf-, p53-, p27Kip1-, or pRb-deficient primary mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) 1The abbreviations used are: MEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGSTglutathione S-transferasePAKp21-activated kinasePI 3-kinasephosphoinositide 3-kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatePTENphosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10WASPWiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein1The abbreviations used are: MEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGSTglutathione S-transferasePAKp21-activated kinasePI 3-kinasephosphoinositide 3-kinaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIP3inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphatePTENphosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10WASPWiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein cells.

Debreceni B. Jia B. Gao Y. Tigyi G. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29648-29654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The retroviral constructs expressing p19Arf, p53 wild type or mutant, and dominant negative Rho GTPases (Rac1N17, Cdc42N17, and RhoAN19) were generated by ligating the corresponding cDNA fragments into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of the retroviral GFP bicistronic vector, MIEG3 (17Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J. Petryniak B. Derrow C. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D. Lowe J. Atkinson S. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). Primary MEFs from p19Arf−/−, p53−/−, p19Arf−/−/p53−/−, p27Kip1−/−, and pRb−/− mice (all of the C57BL/6 × 129/sv background) were generous gifts from Dr. Martine Roussel (St. Jude, Memphis, TN) and were generated as described previously (18Zindy F. Eischen C.M. Randle D.H. Kamijo T. Cleveland J.L. Sherr C.J. Roussel M.F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2424-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Recombinant retroviruses were produced using the ecotropic Phoenix packaging cell system (17Williams D.A. Tao W. Yang F. Kim C. Gu Y. Mansfield P. Levine J. Petryniak B. Derrow C. Harris C. Jia B. Zheng Y. Ambruso D. Lowe J. Atkinson S. Dinauer M.C. Boxer L. Blood. 2000; 96: 1646-1654PubMed Google Scholar). The primary MEFs were infected with the retroviruses and harvested 48–72 h after infection. GFP-positive cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Primary MEFs were seeded onto coverslips at 3 × 104cells/slip density. The cells were serum-starved for 12 h prior to fixation. The F-actin structure of the cells was visualized by rhodamine-phalloidin staining, and the stained cells were analyzed by using a conventional fluorescence microscope (Zeiss). Single cell motility assays using the colloidal gold particles were carried out as described (19Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Takai Y. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 336-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The wound healing assays to semi-quantitatively determine the migration distance were performed following a scratch of the confluent monolayer of cells as described (20Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Gavrilova N. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The migration distances of cells were monitored at various times and were measured at 9 h after the introduction of the wound under low serum (0.5%) conditions. The endogenous PI 3-kinase activities ofArf−/−, p53−/−,Arf−/−/p53−/−, andArf−/− or p53−/−cells reconstituted with Arf or p53 were assayed according to a described protocol (21Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly the cells were lysed in buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate and 25 mm NaF. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 rpm, the protein contents in the supernatant of cell lysates were measured by the Bradford method. An equal amount of proteins was incubated with anti-p85 polyclonal antibody coupled to protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) overnight or subjected to anti-p85 or anti-p110 Western blot analysis. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with buffer C containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2 and washed once with a kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mmMgCl2). 5 μg of sonicated phosphatidylinositol together with [γ-32P]ATP (200 μCi/ml) in 45 μl of the kinase assay buffer were incubated with the washed beads at 25 °C for 10 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 100 μl of 1n HCl. The reaction products were extracted by 200 μl of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1) and resolved on a TLC silica plate coated with potassium oxalate in a solvent containing CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH, 4 m (9:7:2). The PI 3-kinase reactions were analyzed by autoradiography. Prior to Western blotting, the protein contents of the cell lysates were normalized by the Bradford method. Anti-phospho-Akt(Ser473) and anti-PTEN antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling, Inc., anti-p85 and the anti-p110 of PI 3-kinase antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and the PI 3-kinase inhibitors wortmannin and LY294002 were obtained from Sigma. GST-PAK1, GST-Rhotekin, and GST-WASP, which contain Rac1, RhoA, and the Cdc42- interactive domains of PAK1, Rhotekin, and WASP, respectively, were used to probe the endogenous Rac1-GTP, RhoA-GTP, and Cdc42-GTP activities as described (20Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Gavrilova N. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). p19Arf, p53, p27Kip1, and pRb are well recognized cell cycle regulators that are critical to checkpoint control. p19Arf, in response to oncogenic signals, stabilizes p53 by sequestering Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53 (3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), whereas p27Kip1, on its way through pRb, regulates G1 transition by modulating growth-essential E2F transcription factors (1Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). All four are important components of a complex tumor suppressor network. To examine their potential involvement in the regulation of cell actin structure and motility, we have generated the p19Arf-, p53-, p27Kip1-, or pRb-deficient primary MEFs from the respective tumor suppressor knock-out mice. To avoid possible alteration of cell properties under tissue culture conditions, only low passages (<6 passages) of the primary cells were used and at least two independent p53- or p19Arf-deficient MEF preparations were examined. In subconfluent culture and serum-free conditions, a significant percentage of the p19Arf- or p53-deficient cells appeared to be in a round shape and displayed intense cortical actin staining, whereas the p27Kip1- or pRb-deficient cells were similar to wild type MEFs in morphology and actin structure (Fig.1A). To determine whether the altered actin structures might be associated with cell motility modulation, the cells were plated onto colloidal gold-coated plates, and the motility of single cells was traced by the trails left behind their movement paths. As shown in Fig. 1B, in the absence of serum stimulation, both p19Arf- and p53-deficient cells produced long trails, whereas the Kip1 and Rbknock-out cells were similar to the wild type cells, showing no sign of movement. To further quantify cell migration rate, we measured the migration distance of these cells in a wound healing assay. TheArf−/− and p53−/−cells migrated about 2-fold faster than the wild type,Kip1−/−, or Rb−/−cells at 9-h intervals under low serum (0.5% fetal bovine serum) conditions (Fig. 2, A andB), at which time the difference in cell growth was less than 10%. Similar results were also obtained when the cells were serum-starved over a 16-h period (data not shown). When p19Arf and p53 were reintroduced intoArf−/− and p53−/−cells, respectively, by retroviral induction, the migration phenotype of these cells was fully reversed (Fig. 2, C andD). The expression levels of p19Arf or p53 in the reconstituted cells were comparable with or slightly higher than that of the respective wild type cells (Fig. 2E). Thus, p19Arf and p53 negatively regulate cell migration. p19Arf and p53 display both interdependent and independent activities in the regulation of cell cycle progression and in response to DNA damage (3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Deletion of both Arf and p53alleles led to an equally mobile cell phenotype asp19Arf−/− or p53−/−cells in the single cell-based motility assay and in the wound healing assay (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, introduction of p19Arf into theArf−/−/p53−/− cells did not affect cell migration (Fig. 3A). It appears that p19Arf acts upstream of p53 in the regulation of cell motility. p53 functions as a DNA-binding dependent transcription factor in mediating multiple gene activation that is critical to its tumor suppressor activity (22Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6714) Google Scholar). In addition, p53 is also known for a role in negatively regulating the transcription of an array of genes by repression of their transcription. To begin to address the issue of what function of p53 is required for the regulation of cell motility, we examined the ability of two p53 mutants, Gln22/Ser23 and His175, to suppress the migration phenotype of p53−/− cells. Although both mutants are defective in transcriptional regulation of p53-positive genes including that of p21Waf1/Cip1 (23Lin J. Chen J. Elenbaas B. Levine A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar, 24Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3692-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 25Venot C. Maratrat M. Sierra V. Conseiller E. Debussche L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2405-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the Gln22/Ser23 mutation is located in the N-terminal transcription activation domain, which has also been shown to be critical for the binding of TATA-binding protein-associated factors (26Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 27Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 277: 29677-29682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas the His175 mutation resides in the central DNA binding domain of p53, which is the site of a majority of mutations seen in tumors (28Ryan K.M. Phillips A.C. Vousden K.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 332-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). We observed that the Gln22/Ser23 mutant was able to rescue the migration phenotype of p53−/− cells similar to wild type p53, but the His175 mutant was inactive (Fig.3B). These results suggest that specific transcription activity controlled by p53 is responsible for the regulation of cell migration by the p19Arf-p53 tumor suppressor pathway. PI 3-kinase has previously been implicated in the regulation of cell migration (29Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To investigate whether PI 3-kinase contributes to p19Arf- and p53-regulated cell motility, the endogenous PI 3-kinase activity and phospho-Akt(Ser473) content, which is indicative of the endogenous PI 3-kinase activation status of Arf−/−, p53−/−, and Arf−/−/p53−/− MEFs, were examined, and the requirement of PI 3-kinase in p19Arf- and p53-mediated cell migration was assessed by using specific pharmacological inhibitors wortmannin or LY294002 at defined concentrations. As shown in Fig. 4,A and B, genetic deletion of Arf, p53, or Arf and p53led to 3–5-fold increases in PI 3-kinase activity and phospho-Akt(Ser473), which were readily reversed by the reintroduction of Arf or p53. The expression levels of p85α and p110, as well as that of Akt, were not altered in these cells (Fig. 4B; data not shown). The enhanced PI 3-kinase activities are apparently required for the migration phenotype observed in these cells, because inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (wortmannin or LY294002) caused complete reversion of the migration phenotype without affecting the basal movement of the cells (Fig.4C). Under these conditions, wortmannin or LY294002 potently inhibited PI 3-kinase activity (Fig. 4C and data not shown). On the other hand, the expression level of PTEN, a PIP3phosphatase that could be transiently regulated by p53 transcriptional activity (30Stambolic V. MacPherson D. Sas D. Lin Y. Snow B. Jang Y. Benchimol S. Mak T.W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 317-325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar), was not altered in the Arf−/−, p53−/−, orArf−/−/p53−/− cells nor in Arf−/− or p53−/− cells that were forced to expressArf or p53 (Fig. 4D). We conclude thatArf and/or p53 deletion up-regulates PI 3-kinase activity, resulting in increased cell motility. Rho family members Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42 are downstream signaling components of PI 3-kinase and have been implicated in the regulation of cell migration (31Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these Rho proteins might be involved in p19Arf- and p53-regulated migration, we examined the activation status of these Rho proteins in Arf−/− and p53−/− cells by specific effector domain pull-down assays. As shown in Fig.5A, in the absence of serum stimulation, the endogenous levels of GTP-bound active Rac1 and RhoA in p19Arf−/− orp53−/− cells increased by 2- and 6-fold, respectively, compared with those in wild type cells, whereas Cdc42-GTP increased by less than 20%. The Rac1, RhoA, or Cdc42 expression levels were not affected by p19Arf or p53 deletion. When p19Arf or p53 was reintroduced into the knock-out cells, the active Rho protein contents were decreased to the level of wild type cells or lower (Fig. 5A), indicating that p19Arf and p53 suppress the Rho protein activities. Furthermore, among the dominant negative mutants of Rac1 (Rac1N17), RhoA (RhoAN19), and Cdc42 (Cdc42N17), only Rac1N17 was able to completely reverse the migration phenotype in both Arf−/− andp53−/− cells, reducing their migration rates to that of the wild type MEFs, similar to the effect of reintroducing the Arf or p53 gene (Fig. 5B). The three Rho GTPase mutants were expressed equally well in the cells (Fig.5B). These results indicate that Rac1 is a specific mediator of p19Arf- and p53-regulated cell migration. The p53 and Rb genes and their regulatory molecules are central to the growth malfunction of most tumor cells (1Sherr C.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 731-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The p19Arf-p53 pathway, specifically, constitutes a checkpoint in cell cycle progression that is responsive to the proliferative signals normally required for cell proliferation (3Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2984-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Mostly through its transcriptional activity, p53 can inhibit cell cycle progression or induce apoptosis in response to stress or DNA damage. Moreover, p53 is known to be a critical factor in maintaining genomic stability and in eliciting DNA repair reactions (22Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6714) Google Scholar, 32Giaccia A.J. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (1174) Google Scholar). Some earlier evidence also pointed to a regulatory role of p53 in transcriptionally activating a number of genes that could be involved in modulating cell movement (8Comer K.A. Dennis P.A. Armstrong l. Catino J.J. Kastan M.B. Kumar C.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1299-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 9Zhao R. Gish K. Murphy M. Yin Y. Notterman D. Hoffman W.H. Tom E. Mack D.H.

Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 5: 629-634Google Scholar). Two recent studies have begun to address the possibility that p53 might contribute to the regulation of cell movement and polarity (14Alexandrova A. Ivanov A. Chumakov P. Vasiliev J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5826-5830Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 15Gadea G. Lapasset L. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Roux P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By genetic deletion of the tumor suppressors, we show that p19Arf and p53, but not p27Kip1 or pRb, have a profound negative effect on cell motility and migration. p19Arf likely depends on p53 for migration regulation, and specific transcriptional activity, or specific target genes controlled by p53, may serve as the link between the nuclear events and the cytoskeleton, focal adhesion contacts, or extracellular matrix components to promote the migration phenotype. We are currently examining the candidate gene products whose expression profiles are altered by the p19Arf and p53 deficiencies in an effort to identify the molecule(s) responsible for the observed cellular effects. The PI 3-kinase-Rac1 signaling module has been known to mediate growth factor-stimulated cell motility (31Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase (similar to deletion of the PTEN tumor suppressor, which is a PIP3-specific phosphatase that counter-reacts with many PI 3-kinase effects) can cause activation of both Rac1 and Akt and contributes to enhanced cell motility and invasion (20Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Gavrilova N. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 29Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The cell morphological and actin structural changes we have observed inArf−/− and p53−/−MEFs, i.e. a round appearance and intense cortical actin staining, are reminiscent of what was observed in the case ofPTEN−/− cells (20Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Gavrilova N. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), suggesting that elevation of the PIP3 level in the cells may be significant to increased cell movement. Indeed, Rac1 and Akt appear to be important contributors to the migration phenotype in PTEN deficiency (20Liliental J. Moon S.Y. Lesche R. Mamillapalli R. Gavrilova N. Zheng Y. Sun H. Wu H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 401-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 29Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A few previous reports support the assumption that Rac may act independently of Akt in signaling to mammalian cell migration (33Van Weering D.H. de Rooij J. Marte B. Downward J. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 34Welch H. Eguinoa A. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11248-11256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but a recent study employing constitutively active and dominant negative Akt in fibroblasts shows that Akt is an essential mediator of Rac-regulated cell motility stimulated through PI 3-kinase activation (29Higuchi M. Masuyama N. Fukui Y. Suzuki A. Gotoh Y. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1958-1962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the context of our finding that PI 3-kinase and Rac1 of this module are required for p19Arf- and p53-regulated migration, it seems logical that a hierarchical link among them may be at work to transduce signals resulting from the genetic defects of these tumor suppressors to cell activities related to migration, although the detailed relationship among them remains to be determined. The components that serve to further relay signals from Rac1 and/or Akt to cell motility might include PAK, phosphoinositide 5-kinase, and WAVE-like actin polymerization molecules (31Ridley A.J. J.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) have recently shown that p53 function is necessary for the suppression of Cdc42-induced filopodia formation and may transcriptionally control the initiating components of filopodia. Although conceptually our observation draws a similar conclusion regarding the negative effect of the Cdc42-mediated cell response imposed by p53, the mechanistic details of our cell motility results may differ from the interpretation of Gadea et al.(15Gadea G. Lapasset L. Gauthier-Rouviere C. Roux P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2373-2382Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), drawn mostly from the Cdc42 and/or p53 overexpression experiments. In the present work, although Rac1 and RhoA activities are shown to be up-regulated by deletion of Arf orp53, Rac1, but not RhoA nor Cdc42, appears to provide the key functional linkage between the p19Arf-p53 pathway and cell motility. However it remains likely that the contributions of Cdc42-mediated cell polarity and RhoA-mediated cell adhesion are an integral part of the p19Arf- and p53-regulated cytoskeleton organization and related functional output. A recent gene array study has identified heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) as a p53-responsive gene product that could be up-regulated by DNA damage and p53 induction (36Fang L. Li G. Liu G. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). HB-EGF may protect cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis through MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and PI 3-kinase activation, presenting a possible autocrine regulatory loop linking p53 induction with PI 3-kinase and Akt activation. Whether this p53-mediated regulatory pathway is functional in the p53−/− background remains unknown. In light of our finding that p53 deletion would cause an up-regulation rather than a down-regulation of PI 3-kinase activity, it is likely that the above proposed p53 to HB-EGF to PI 3-kinase pathway might be suppressed by another more dominant component unleashed by p53 deletion, which preferably stimulates the PI 3-kinase-Rac1-Akt signaling module when the p19Arf-p53 pathway is impaired. This possibility is currently under investigation. In summary, we have demonstrated that the p19Arf-p53 tumor suppressor pathway negatively regulates cell motility, revealing an interesting connection between the established tumor suppressor pathway and the PI 3-kinase-Rac1 signaling module that is known to modulate cell migration. The results provide insights into a previously under-appreciated cellular function of the tumor suppressor pathway and may have important implications in developing strategies that target Rho proteins in anti-cancer therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2018150950,"The protein-tyrosine kinase Pyk2/CAKβ/CADTK is a key activator of Src in many cells. At hippocampal synapses, induction of long term potentiation requires the Pyk2/Src signaling pathway, which up-regulates the activity of<i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptors. Because localization of protein kinases close to their substrates is crucial for effective phosphorylation, we investigated how Pyk2 might be recruited to the <i>N</i>-methyl-d-aspartate receptor complex. This interaction is mediated by PSD-95 and its homolog SAP102. Both proteins colocalize with Pyk2 at postsynaptic dendritic spines in the cerebral cortex. The proline-rich regions in the C-terminal half of Pyk2 bind to the SH3 domain of PSD-95 and SAP102. The SH3 and guanylate kinase homology (GK) domain of PSD-95 and SAP102 interact intramolecularly, but the physiological significance of this interaction has been unclear. We show that Pyk2 effectively binds to the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain of SAP102 only when the GK domain is removed from the SH3 domain. Characterization of PSD-95 and SAP102 as adaptor proteins for Pyk2 fills a critical gap in the understanding of the spatial organization of the Pyk2-Src signaling pathway at the postsynaptic site and reveals a physiological function of the intramolecular SH3-GK domain interaction in SAP102."
https://openalex.org/W2136311219,"While reading this text, your eyes jump from word to word. Yet you are unaware of the motion this causes on your retina; the brain somehow compensates for these displacements and creates a stable percept of the world. This compensation is not perfect; perisaccadically, perceptual space is distorted. We show that this distortion can be traced to a representation of retinal position in the medial temporal and medial superior temporal areas. These cells accurately represent retinal position during fixation, but perisaccadically, the same cells distort the representation of space. The time course and magnitude of this distortion are similar to the mislocalization found psychophysically in humans. This challenges the assumption in many psychophysical studies that the perisaccadic retinal position signal is veridical."

To gain insight into the structural basis of DR3 function, we have determined the location of DR3 in the three-dimensional structure of RyR2. We inserted green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the middle of the DR3 region after Thr-1874 in the sequence. HEK293 cells expressing this GFP-RyR2 fusion protein, RyR2T1874-GFP, were readily detected by their green fluorescence, indicating proper folding of the inserted GFP. RyR2T1874-GFP was further characterized functionally by assays of Ca2+ release and [3H]ryanodine binding. These analyses revealed that RyR2T1874-GFPfunctions as a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+release channel and displays Ca2+ dependence and [3H]ryanodine binding properties similar to those of the wild type RyR2.

The ryanodine receptor (RyR), 1The abbreviations used are: RyRryanodine receptorCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonateECexcitation-contractioncryo-EMcryoelectron microscopyGFPgreen fluorescent proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid located in the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum of a variety of cells, functions as an intracellular Ca2+ release channel and plays an essential role in various fundamental cellular processes including muscle contraction and relaxation, fertilization, and apoptosis (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Three RyR isoforms, RyR1, RyR2, and RyR3, have been identified in mammalian tissues and have been shown to display distinct patterns of expression. RyR1 is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle, whereas RyR2 is mainly expressed in cardiac muscle and the brain. RyR3 expression is widespread but at relatively low levels (2Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 3Sutko J.L. Airey J.A.

Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 893-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The physiological function and mechanism of activation are also specific to each RyR isoform. RyR1 is required for excitation-contraction (EC) coupling in skeletal muscle, in which RyR1 is activated upon depolarization by the voltage sensor, the L-type Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor, DHPR), through a direct physical interaction. RyR2, on the other hand, mediates EC coupling in cardiac muscle, and it is activated by Ca2+ influx through the L-type Ca2+ channel via a mechanism known as Ca2+-induced Ca2+release. Importantly, neither RyR2 nor RyR3 is capable of substituting for RyR1 in mediating skeletal type EC coupling (2Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 6Rios E. Pizarro G. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 849-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 7Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol.

Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3397) Google Scholar). The physiological role of RyR3 is unclear, but RyR3 has been shown to be involved in amplification of the Ca2+ signal generated by RyR1 in skeletal muscle (3Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1027-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 10Yang D. Pan Z. Takeshima H. Wu C. Nagaraj R.Y. Ma J. Cheng H. J. Biol.

Furstenau M. Wellner M. Sorrentino V. Haller H. Luft F.C. Gollasch M. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 1051-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Some of these functional differences among RyR isoforms are likely to be attributable to differences in their primary sequences. One of our goals is to determine which differences in the amino acid sequences of the isoforms are responsible for these functional variations. ryanodine receptor 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate excitation-contraction cryoelectron microscopy green fluorescent protein 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid The amino acid sequences of the three RyR isoforms share a high degree of sequence identity (66–70%) with their major variations occurring in three regions, known as divergent regions 1, 2, and 3 (DR1, DR2, and DR3) (12Sorrentino V. Volpe P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 98-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). The DR1 region comprises residues 4254–4631 of RyR1 and residues 4210–4562 of RyR2. The DR2 region includes residues 1342–1403 of RyR1 and residues 1353–1397 of RyR2. Residues 1872–1923 of RyR1 and residues 1852–1890 of RyR2 are denoted as the DR3 region. These divergent regions have been the focus of a number of structural and functional studies. For instance, sequence variations in the DR1 region between RyR1 and RyR2 have been shown to account for the isoforms' different sensitivities to Ca2+ inactivation (13Du G.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26120-26126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Du G.G. Khanna V.K. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 459: 154-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the DR2 region, which is absent in RyR3, was found to be critical for skeletal muscle EC coupling, since deletion of DR2 in RyR1 abolished EC coupling (16Yamazawa T. Takeshima H. Shimuta M. Iino M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8161-8164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The DR3 region appears to have multiple roles in RyR channel function. In RyR1, DR3 consists of a stretch of ∼30 negatively charged amino acid residues that are thought to constitute a low affinity Ca2+ binding site (17Zorzato F. Fujii J. Otsu K. Phillips M. Green N.M. Lai F.A. Meissner G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2244-2256Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, deletion of the DR3 region altered the Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent regulation and conduction properties of the RyR1 channel (18Bhat M.B. Zhao J. Hayek S. Freeman E.C. Takeshima H. Ma J. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1320-1328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Hayek S.M. Zhao J. Bhat M. Xu X. Nagaraj R. Pan Z. Takeshima H. Ma J.

J. 2000; 351: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). A region of RyR1 between residues 1837 and 2168, encompassing the DR3 region, has also been shown to interact with the II-III loop of the DHPR and to participate in EC coupling (21Proenza C. O'Brien J. Nakai J. Mukherjee S. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6530-6535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the interaction between a sequence in the II-III loop of DHPR and RyR1 was enhanced by the 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), suggesting that FKBP12 may modulate EC coupling in skeletal muscle (22O'Reilly F.M. Robert M. Jona I. Szegedi C. Albrieux M. Geib S. De Waard M. Villaz M. Ronjat M. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 145-155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that an NH2-terminal fragment containing the first 1937 residues of RyR2 is sufficient to enable GST-FKBP12.6 binding, whereas a shorter NH2-terminal fragment including only the first 1636 residues is unable to bind GST-FKBP12.6, indicating that the region between residues 1636 and 1937 of RyR2, encompassing the DR3 region, is required for FKBP12.6 interaction (23Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whether the corresponding region in RyR1 is essential for FKBP12-RyR1 interaction has yet to be determined. Taken together, these observations suggest that residues within or near the DR3 region may be involved in EC coupling and in channel regulation by Ca2+, Mg2+, or FKBPs. The molecular mechanisms by which the DR3 region participates in such seemingly diverse functions are, however, unknown. One approach to understanding the roles of individual regions or domains in RyR channel function is to map their three-dimensional locations in the channel structure. The three-dimensional structures of all three RyR isoforms have been determined to ∼30–40 Å by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) combined with single particle image processing (24Wagenknecht T. Samso M. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1464-d1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Serysheva I.I. Schatz M. van Heel M. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The three RyR isoforms display virtually identical three-dimensional structures, as expected based on their high degree of sequence identity. The three-dimensional structure of RyR is essentially composed of two major components: a cytoplasmic assembly and a transmembrane assembly. The cytoplasmic assembly contains at least 10 domains (26Radermacher M. Rao V. Grassucci R. Frank J. Timerman A.P. Fleischer S. Wagenknecht T. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Large conformational changes, particularly in the clamp-shaped structure that includes domains 5, 6, 9, and 10, and is located at the corners of the cytoplasmic assembly, have been observed when the channel was switched from the closed to the open state (25Serysheva I.I. Schatz M. van Heel M. Chiu W. Hamilton S.L. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 1936-1944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 27Orlova E.V. Serysheva II van Heel M. Hamilton S.L. Chiu W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional locations of several ligand binding sites, including those for calmodulin, FKBP12, FKBP12.6, and Imperatoxin A, have been identified (24Wagenknecht T. Samso M. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d1464-d1474Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently mapped the three-dimensional locations of the NH2-terminal and DR1 regions. The NH2 terminus is located at the corners within the clamp structure, whereas the DR1 region maps to domain 3, also known as the “handle” domain, adjacent to the calmodulin binding site (28Liu Z. Zhang J. Sharma M.R. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6104-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the present study, in order to gain insight into the structural basis and functions of the DR3 region, we have constructed and expressed in HEK293 cells a RyR2 fusion protein in which green fluorescence protein (GFP) was inserted into the DR3 region after residue Thr-1874 in the sequence (RyR2T1874-GFP). The RyR2T1874-GFP protein was purified and then subjected to cryo-EM and single-particle image processing. Three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2T1874-GFP revealed the localization of GFP, and therefore of DR3, to a region in domain 9 in the clamp-shaped structure, adjacent to the known FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 binding sites. These results suggest a role of the DR3 region in conformational changes and in EC coupling, and they further demonstrate the utility of this approach in correlating linear sequence to three-dimensional structure, thereby allowing an understanding of the structural basis of RyR function.

Soybean phosphatidylcholine was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. CHAPS and other reagents were purchased from Sigma. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described previously (30Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol.

HEK293 cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture dishes for 18–20 h after subculture were transfected with 6–12 μg of wild type (WT) or mutant RyR cDNAs using Ca2+ phosphate precipitation (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cloning and construction of the 15-kb full-length cDNA encoding the mouse cardiac RyR2 has been described previously (32Zhao M. Li P. Li X. Zhang L. Winkfein R.J. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25971-25974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding GFP flanked by Gly-rich spacers and an AscI site was obtained by PCR as described previously (29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The AscI site was introduced into the DR3 region of RyR2 after Thr-1874 in the sequence by overlap-extension using PCR (33Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The “outer” primers used were as follows: forward, 5′-GATCCTCTGCAGTTCATGTCCCTC-3′; reverse, 5′-TCCATCACTGTCTCATGCATCCC-3′. The primers for introducing theAscI site were as follows: forward, 5′-AGTATAGAAGACGGGCGCGCCGAAGGCGAAGAAGAAGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-TTCTTCGCCTTCGGCGCGCCCGTCTTCTATACTGATCTC-3′. TheBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (6439) PCR fragment containing the AscI site was used to replace theBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment in the full-length RyR2. The missing EcoRV (6439)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment was then added back to yield the full-length RyR2 with the inserted AscI site. TheAscI-AscI fragment containing GFP and the spacers was then subcloned into the full-length RyR2 at the introducedAscI site. The sequences of all PCR fragments and the orientation of the inserted GFP cDNA were verified by DNA sequencing analysis. Construction of the 1–1937 and 1–1636 COOH-terminal truncation mutants was described earlier (23Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PCR was used to introduce a stop codon after residues 1895, 1855, 1815, 1775, and 1735 to generate the COOH-terminal truncation mutants, 1–1895, 1–1855, 1–1815, 1–1775, and 1–1735, respectively. The forward primer used for all truncation mutants was 5′-GATCCTCTGCAGTTCATGTCCCTC-3′. The reverse primers, each containing a stop codon followed by anEcoRV site were 5′-ATGATATCTCACATCTGGAGCAAGCCTTCCTT-3′ (1895-stop), 5′-ATGATATCTCAAGCTTCCTTAAACACACTGGG-3′ (1855-stop), 5′-ATGATATCTCACGTGGTCCCACCCACAGGATC-3′ (1815-stop), 5′-GATATCCTAGTCGTTGCTAATGCTCACGA-3′ (1775-stop), and 5′-GATATCCTACTTTGTCTCCTCTGTCATAG-3′ (1735-stop). TheBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (introduced after the stop codon at various sites) PCR fragments were used to replace theBsu36I (4900)-EcoRV (13,873) fragment in the full-length RyR2 cDNA to yield the various COOH-terminal truncation mutants. All truncation mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression and purification of RyR2T1874-GFP was carried out as described previously (29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The purified RyR2T1874-GFP was diluted 5–10-fold with EM dilution buffer (20 mm Na-PIPES, (pH 7.2), 400 mm KCl, 3 mm EGTA, 0.5% CHAPS, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin). Grids were prepared for cryo-EM according to standard methods (34Wagenknecht T. Frank J. Boublik M. Nurse K. Ofengand J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Micrographs were recorded using low dose protocols on a Philips EM420, equipped with low dose kit and a GATAN 626 cryotransfer holder, at a magnification of 38,600 × (±2%) as verified by a tobacco mosaic virus standard. Each exposure corresponded to an electron dose of ∼10 e−/Å2. Micrographs were checked for drift, astigmatism, and presence of Thon rings by optical diffraction. Selected electron micrographs were digitized on a Zeiss/Imaging scanner (Z/I Imaging Corp., Huntsville, AL) with a step size of 14 μm. Images were processed using the SPIDER/WEB software package (35Frank J. Three-Dimensional Electron Microscopy of Macromolecular Assemblies. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 54-125Crossref Google Scholar), and three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained through use of the projection matching procedure (29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P.

Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). The final three-dimensional reconstructions of WT RyR2 and RyR2T1874-GFP were computed, respectively, from 4365 and 4374 particles. 4-Fold symmetry was enforced in both three-dimensional reconstructions. The final resolutions of both reconstructions were estimated to be 34 Å by Fourier shell correlation using a cut-off value of 0.5 (37Malhotra A. Penczek P. Agrawal R.K. Gabashvili I.S. Grassucci R.A. Junemann R. Burkhardt N. Nierhaus K.H. Frank J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The difference map was calculated by subtracting the three-dimensional volume of the WT RyR2 from the RyR2T1844-GFP volume. Measurements of free cytosolic Ca2+concentrations in the transfected HEK293 cells, using fluorescence Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3, and of equilibrium [3H]ryanodine binding to cell lysate were done as described previously (38Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). GST-FKBP12.6 pull-down, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting were carried out as described previously (23Masumiya H. Wang R. Zhang J. Xiao B. Chen S.R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3786-3792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To understand how the DR3 region participates in channel function and regulation, we attempted to map the location of the DR3 region onto the three-dimensional structure of RyR2. To this end, we constructed a RyR2 fusion protein (RyR2T1874-GFP) in which GFP was inserted into the middle of the DR3 region, after residue Thr-1874 in the sequence (Fig. 1). The strategy was to use GFP, a relatively small protein (238 amino acids, compared with the ∼5000 amino acids of RyR), as a structural marker (39Doi N. Yanagawa H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 183: 49-55PubMed Google Scholar, 40Niwa H. Inouye S. Hirano T. Matsuno T. Kojima S. Kubota M. Ohashi M. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13617-13622Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Through comparison of the three-dimensional reconstructions of the WT RyR2 and GFP-inserted RyR2, it would then be feasible to map the location of GFP and thus the region into which GFP was inserted. To minimize potential perturbation of the channel folding and function of RyR2, we added two glycine-rich spacers on either side of GFP (40Niwa H. Inouye S. Hirano T. Matsuno T. Kojima S. Kubota M. Ohashi M. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13617-13622Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Since the fluorescence of GFP depends on the proper folding of its own structure and the structure of the inserted region (40Niwa H. Inouye S. Hirano T. Matsuno T. Kojima S. Kubota M. Ohashi M. Tsuji F.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13617-13622Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 41Waldo G.S. Standish B.M. Berendzen J. Terwilliger T.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar), GFP could be used not only as a structural marker but also as an indicator of proper protein folding. Fig. 2A shows phase-contrast and fluorescent microscopic images of the HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2T1874-GFP. Green fluorescent HEK293 cells were readily detected after transfection (Fig. 2A, a), whereas no fluorescence was observed in HEK293 cells transfected with the WT RyR2 (data not shown). The green fluorescence indicates that the inserted GFP and its neighboring region are likely to have folded properly. A reticular pattern of distribution of RyR2T1874-GFP was observed in most of the fluorescent cells, as expected based on its function as an intracellular Ca2+ release channel (Fig.2B). In some cells, however, the fluorescence appeared as an amorphous mass due to heavy expression of the RyR2T1874-GFPprotein. To further demonstrate that RyR2T1874-GFP retains proper folding, we assessed its functional properties. We measured Ca2+ release from transfected HEK293 cells using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye fluo-3. As shown in Fig.2B, HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2T1874-GFPcDNA displayed multiple Ca2+ release events in response to repeated stimulation by caffeine (Fig. 2B, a), an activator of RyRs. Transfected cells pretreated with ryanodine, on the other hand, responded only to the first and not the second or third caffeine stimulation (Fig. 2B, b), suggesting that RyR2T1874-GFP is sensitive to ryanodine modification (42Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The immediate drop in fluorescence after the second and third caffeine stimulations was caused by fluorescence quenching by caffeine (42Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Similar Ca2+ release responses to caffeine and ryanodine were observed in HEK293 cells transfected with WT RyR2 (42Chen S.R. Li P. Zhao M. Li X. Zhang L. Biophys. J. 2002; 82: 2436-2447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). No caffeine- or ryanodine-induced Ca2+ release was detected in nontransfected HEK293 cells or in cells transfected with pCDNA3 vector DNA (data not shown). Thus, RyR2T1874-GFP is able to form a caffeine- and ryanodine-sensitive Ca2+ release channel in HEK293 cells. The functional properties of RyR2T1874-GFP were further characterized by [3H]ryanodine binding studies, which have been widely used as a functional assay for RyR channel activity, since ryanodine has access to its binding site only when the channel is open (43Tanna B. Welch W. Ruest L. Sutko J.L. Williams A.J. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 55-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows [3H]ryanodine binding to a cell lysate prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with RyR2T1874-GFP in the presence of a wide range of Ca2+ concentrations. Analysis of the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding by the Hill equation yielded an EC50 of 0.20 ± 0.02 μm (mean ± S.E., n = 3). This EC50 value is similar to that reported for the WT RyR2 (29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We also performed binding in the presence of various concentrations of [3H]ryanodine (Fig. 3B). Scatchard analysis of these binding data revealed that RyR2T1874-GFP exhibited high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding with a Kd of 2.75 ± 0.43 nm (n = 3), which is also similar to the behavior of [3H]ryanodine binding to WT RyR2 reported previously (38Li P. Chen S.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 118: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). No ryanodine binding activity was detected in lysates from HEK293 cells transfected with either pCDNA3 vector DNA or no DNA. Taken together, these results suggest that the insertion of GFP after Thr-1874 does not significantly alter the structure or function of RyR2. RyR2T1874-GFPretains the ability to interact with GST-FKBP12.6. Taking advantage of this property, we were able to purify the RyR2T1874-GFPprotein from transfected HEK293 cell lysate by affinity chromatography in a single step using GST-FKBP12.6 as the affinity ligand. The purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. A single high molecular weight band, which migrated at a slightly slower rate than the WT RyR2 (as expected due to the addition of GFP), was detected in the purified sample of RyR2T1874-GFP (Fig.4A). This band was recognized by both the anti-RyR and anti-GFP antibodies and hence corresponds to RyR2T1874-GFP. On the other hand, the purified WT RyR2 protein was recognized only by the anti-RyR antibody and not by the anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 4, B and C). RyR2T1874-GFP appears to be expressed in an intact form; no degradation products were detected. The purified RyR2T1874-GFPproteins were preserved in a thin layer of vitreous ice and imaged by cryo-EM. Fig. 5 shows a typical electron micrograph of frozen-hydrated RyR2T1874-GFP in which individual RyR2T1874-GFP particles are readily visualized. The particles displayed an apparently intact structure with multiple orientations similar to those observed in the WT RyR2 (29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Single particle image processing was then applied to obtain a more detailed structure of RyR2T1874-GFP. Fig.6A shows a surface representation of the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2T1874-GFP in three orientations (top, bottom, and side views). The overall form of the reconstructed RyR2T1874-GFPstructure resembles a mushroom in shape and consists of two major components: a large squarelike cytoplasmic assembly (290 × 290 × 130 Å) encompassing 10 distinct domains (labeled bynumerals in Fig. 6) and a smaller transmembrane assembly (120 × 120 × 70 Å, labeled TA). Overall, the three-dimensional reconstruction of RyR2T1874-GFP is very similar to that of the recombinant WT RyR2 obtained previously (29Liu Z. Zhang J. Li P. Chen S.R. Wagenknecht T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46712-46719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), but close examination reveals some small differences. The most noticeable difference was found on domain 9"
https://openalex.org/W2172254818,"The analysis of object motion and stereoscopic depth are important tasks that are begun at early stages of the primate visual system. Using sparse white noise, we mapped the receptive field substructure of motion and disparity interactions in neurons in V1 and MT of alert monkeys. Interactions in both regions revealed subunits similar in structure to V1 simple cells. For both motion and stereo, the scale and shape of the receptive field substructure could be predicted from conventional tuning for bars or dot-field stimuli, indicating that the small-scale interactions were repeated across the receptive fields. We also found neurons in V1 and in MT that were tuned to combinations of spatial and temporal binocular disparities, suggesting a possible neural substrate for the perceptual Pulfrich phenomenon. Our observations constrain computational and developmental models of motion-stereo integration."
https://openalex.org/W2149362050,"Polymerization of serpins commonly results from mutations in the shutter region underlying the bifurcation of strands 3 and 5 of the A-sheet, with entry beyond this point being barred by a H-bond network centered on His-334. Exposure of this histidine in antithrombin, which has a partially opened sheet, allows polymerization and peptide insertion to occur at pH 6 or less when His-334 will be predictably protonated with disruption of the H-bond network. Similarly, thermal stability of antithrombin is pH-dependent with a single unfolding transition at pH 6, but there is no such transition when His-334 is buried by a fully closed A-sheet in heparin-complexed antithrombin or in α1-antitrypsin. Replacement of His-334 in α1-antitrypsin by a serine or alanine at pH 7.4 results in the same polymerization and loop-peptide acceptance observed with antithrombin at low pH. The critical role of His-334 and the re-formation of its H-bond network by the conserved P8 threonine, on the full insertion of strand 4, are relevant for the design of therapeutic blocking agents.

Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar) provides a clear example of the way in which dysfunction and disease can result from conformational instability (2Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 3Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The inhibitory function of the serpins is dependent on a triggered opening of the five-stranded A β-sheet of the molecule to allow the insertion of the cleaved reactive center loop as an additional strand in the center of the sheet (4Loebermann H. Tokuoka R. Deisenhofer J. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 531-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar, 5Stratikos E. Gettins P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

As a consequence, the serpins are particularly vulnerable to mutations affecting the critical region of the molecule underlying the point of entry of the loop, between strands 3 and 5 of the sheet (7Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mutations in this shutter region (Fig. 1a) allow the aberrant opening of the A-sheet, with the risk of the insertion, into its lower half, of the reactive loop of another molecule to give intermolecular linkage and polymerization of the serpin. Even minor changes in the shutter region of α1-antitrypsin (8Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Takabe K. Takahashi H. Miyake K. Kira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12627-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and antichymotrypsin (9Poller W. Faber J.-P. Weidinger S. Tief K. Scholz S. Fischer M. Olek K. Kirchgesser M. Heidtmann H.-H. Genomics. 1993; 17: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) result in their polymerization and intracellular aggregation with consequent lung and liver disease and similarly with C1-inhibitor (10Eldering E. Verpy E. Roem D. Meo T. Tosi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2579-2587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and antithrombin mutations (11Lane D.A. Bayston T. Olds R.J. Fitches A.C. Cooper D.N. Millar D.S. Jochmans K. Perry D.J. Okajima K. Thein S.L. Emmerich J. Thromb. Haemost. 1997; 77: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) resulting in angioedema and thrombosis. But the best example of the critical function of this region comes from recent investigations of a novel form of familial neurodegenerative disease due to the aggregation within neurons of a brain-specific serpin, neuroserpin (12Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The polymerization and aggregation of neuroserpin results from mutations in its shutter region. Two of these mutations affect residues previously identified in other serpin diseases, Ser-53 and -56 (template numbering (13Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) is used throughout this paper). The dysfunction accompanying mutations of serines 53 and 56 is readily explicable by the alteration in packing of residues underlying the A-sheet at the point where a sliding movement opens the gap between strands 3 and 5A (2Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 7Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). But a third and novel mutation in neuroserpin (14Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Gerhard L. Baumann B. Lawrence D.A. Yepes M. Kim T.S. Ghetti B. Piccardo P. Takao M. Lacbawan F. Muenke M. Sifers R.N. Bradshaw C.B. Kent P.F. Collins G.H. Larocca D. Holohan P.D. Lancet. 2002; 359: 2242-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) has also focused attention on histidine 334 at the point of bifurcation of strands 3 and 5 (Fig. 1, b and c). This conserved histidine is centrally placed in the shutter region and is less directly involved in the critical packing interactions of sheet opening than either serine 53 or 56, but surprisingly the mutation of His-334 results in a much more severe neurodegenerative disease. An explanation for this is likely to be the key H-bond network centered on His-334, which bridges strands 3 and 5 of the A-sheet and notably links His-334 directly to the base of Ser-53 and indirectly to Ser-56 (Fig. 1, b andc). The potential role of His-334 as a guardian of sheet opening is indicated in the crystallographic structures of two serpins, antithrombin and heparin cofactor II (16Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J. Grootenhuis P.D. Hol W.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 17Baglin T.P. Carrell R.W. Church F.C. Esmon C.T. Huntington J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11079-11084Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Both of these serpins are exceptional in having, in their native states, a partial opening of the A-sheet with an initial insertion of the reactive loop (to a level of P14, see Fig. 1a). In both, the hydrogen bonding between strands 3 and 5 does not commence until His-334 (at the level of insertion of P8 in cleaved serpins), which appears as the first barrier to further opening of the sheet (Fig. 1b). The consequences of the loss of this barrier and of opening the A-sheet are potentially 2-fold. It can allow the complete insertion of the uncleaved reactive loop of the molecule to give the inactive latent form or it can allow the incorporation of the reactive center loop of another molecule resulting in serpin polymerization. Transition to the latent state takes place as a physiological mechanism in the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (18Mottonen J. Strand A. Symersky J. Sweet R.M. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Gerard R.D. Goldsmith E.J. Nature. 1992; 355: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), which exceptionally among the serpins has a glutamine rather than a histidine at 334 (19Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Transition to the latent form is also a significant pathological mechanism in the conformationally unstable mutants of antithrombin in which a premature conversion to the latent conformation can result in a catastrophic decrease in antithrombin activity with massive thrombosis (20Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More commonly though, with most serpins such as α1-antitrypsin, the opening of the A-sheet predominantly results in the formation of loop-sheet polymers with the insertion of the P7-3 portion of the loop of one molecule into the lower half of the A-sheet of the next molecule (21Sivasothy P. Dafforn T.R. Gettins P.G. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33663-33668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Here we show how studies of both types of transition in antithrombin and α1-antitrypsin confirm the critical function of His-334 as a barrier to premature opening of the A-sheet.

This mixture was applied to a heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography column previously equilibrated with the same buffer, and the column was thoroughly washed with equilibration buffer. The antithrombin was eluted using a gradient from 0.4 to 2 mNaCl in the equilibration buffer. Antithrombin peaks were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column. Antithrombin was concentrated in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, and snap-frozen. Latent antithrombin was prepared using the glycerol method (25Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. Mushunje A. Zhou A. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, native antithrombin was incubated with 40% glycerol in 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6) for 24–36 h at 50 °C, which gave nearly 100% latent formation. After incubation, the samples were diluted 4-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA loaded onto a HiTrap-Q-Sepharose column and washed with the same buffer. Latent antithrombin was eluted with a 0–0.5m NaCl gradient in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. The concentration of antithrombin was determined using an extinction coefficient of 6.5 (26Nordenman B. Nystrom C. Bjork I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Human α1-antitrypsin cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the expression vector pQE31 as previously described (27Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis was carried out by a two-step polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant α1-antitrypsin was expressed with an MRSHHHHHH tag at the N terminus and purified from the soluble fraction of E. coli lysate. Briefly, expression plasmids were transformed into SG13009 (pREP4) cells and grown in 2 liters of 2× tryptone-yeast extract medium at 37 °C untilA600nm = 0.8–1.0; then isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was transferred to 30 °C for a further 3 h. The cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer A (25 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl, and 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol), and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant of the cell lysate was loaded onto a HiTrap nickel-chelating column (5 ml), and after washing to baseline with buffer A, the bound protein eluted as a shouldered peak with an imidazole gradient (0–0.2m). The fractions containing antitrypsin were collected, dialyzed against buffer B (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), and loaded onto a HiTrap Q-Sepharose column (5 ml). The column was then washed with a NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in buffer B. α1-Antitrypsin was eluted as the major peak (second peak) around 0.2 m NaCl. The fractions were pooled, concentrated, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 5.3 (28Pannell R. Johnson D. Travis J. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 5439-5445Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). All α1-antitrypsin variants were confirmed to be in pure monomeric form by SDS and native PAGE. α1-Antitrypsin was mixed with trypsin (1:2 molar ratio) at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) for 15 min. Samples were then mixed with reduced SDS-loading buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min in a PCR block. SDS-gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) was performed in a 12% gel, and the protein was visualized with Coomassie Blue. Stoichiometries of inhibition were determined by incubating increasing concentrations of α1-antitrypsin with a fixed concentration of trypsin (1μ m). Reactions were incubated at room temperature (22 ± 1 °C) for 30 min. The residual amidolytic activity was determined by the addition of 0.1 mm S-2222 substrate in PBS with 0.1% PEG 8000. Linear regression analysis of the decrease in protease activity with an increasing concentration of α1-antitrypsin yielded the estimates for the stoichiometry of inhibition as the intercept on the abscissa. The rates of inhibition of trypsin by recombinant α1-antitrypsin variants were determined at room temperature by a discontinuous assay procedure as previously described (27Zhou A. Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27541-27547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, under pseudo first-order conditions, 10 μl of 0.5 μmα1-antitrypsin variants were mixed with 10 μl of 20 nm trypsin in PBS with 0.1% PEG 8000. The residual protease activity was determined at timed intervals by diluting the reaction mixture into 1 ml of the assay buffer containing 0.1 mm S-2222 substrate. The observed rate constant,kobs, for the reaction was obtained from the slope of a semilog plot of the residual protease activity against time, and the second-order rate constant, kapp, was calculated by dividing kobs by the initial α1-antitrypsin concentration. Circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed using a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter. Samples of α1-antitrypsin or antithrombin were prepared in 0.1m sodium acetate for pH 4–6, 0.1 m sodium phosphate for pH 6–8, 0.1 m Tris for pH 8–9, and 0.1m glycine for pH 9–10. All buffers were filtered, and samples were centrifuged before the experiment. Thermal unfolding experiments were performed by monitoring the CD signal at 222 nm between 25 and 95 °C using a heating rate of 2 °C/min at a concentration of 0.25 mg/ml for antitrypsin variants and 0.5 mg/ml for antithrombin. Melting points (Tm) were calculated using an expression for a two-state transition as described previously (30Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). All the results are the average of three experiments. The pH-dependent antithrombin thermal melting points were treated as a single transition between pH 5 and 8, and the pKa of this transition was fitted by GraFit (version 3.0, Erithacus Software Ltd.). Equilibrium unfolding was monitored by spectrofluorimetry (λex = 290 nm, λem = 350 nm) in the presence of guanidine chloride (GdmCl).1 Antithrombin was incubated in a buffer (50 mm phosphate or sodium acetate, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) containing various concentrations of GdmCl at 25 °C for about 16 h before spectral measurements. The final concentration of protein was 20 μg/ml. Equilibrium unfolding was fitted to a two-state model, and the midpoints [GdmCl]1/2 of unfolding curves at different pH were plotted against pH. Antitrypsin variants were incubated at 1 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at temperature from 37 to 65 °C. Samples were loaded onto an 8% (w/v) native gel. The proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue. Antithrombin at 0.5 mg/ml or α1-antitrypsin variants at 0.68 mg/ml were incubated at 37 °C in the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the P14-P3 12-mer peptide (acetyl-SEAAASTAVVIA) at different pH values or the 6-mer peptide (FLEAIG) for different time intervals. The results were analyzed by loading the samples onto an 8% (w/v) native gel with 7 m urea. Native antithrombin (1 mg/ml) was incubated with 2 mm of P14-8 peptide of antithrombin (acetyl-SEAAAS) and a tri-peptide (formyl-MLF) at 37 °C for 24 h. Samples were then washed several times with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, in a concentrator to remove most of the free peptides, with concentration to 14 mg/ml. Crystallization was performed using hanging drop methods as previously described (31Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Antithrombin-peptide complexes were mixed with equal amounts of latent antithrombin and equilibrated against 10–20% PEG 4000 in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.8, and 0.2 mNH4F, with or without 12% glycerol. Crystals grew to full size in ∼1 week. Diffraction data to 2.8 Å were collected from a single frozen crystal at Daresbury Synchrotron Radiation Source (station 14-2) and processed using Mosflm (32Leslie A.W.G.

Open table in a new tab Prolonged heating of antithrombin and α1-antitrypsin at temperatures above 50 °C results not only in their polymerization (Fig.2a) but also in a transition of a proportion of molecules to the latent conformation. This transition to the latent form is minor and barely detectable with α1-antitrypsin. However, latent antithrombin is readily formed, though it may not be apparent due to the immediate formation of a heterodimer (20Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with reversible sheet C linkage of the latent antithrombin to a molecule of active native antithrombin (Fig.2b). With antithrombin, the addition of glycerol to the incubation buffer suppresses polymer formation but allows the latent transition (20Zhou A. Huntington J.A. Carrell R.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such that incubation at 50 °C of antithrombin in 40% glycerol results in the quantitative preparation of latent antithrombin (25Carrell R.W. Huntington J.A. Mushunje A. Zhou A. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 14-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), free of polymers (Fig. 2b). The incubation of antithrombin at 50 °C for 16 h over a range of pH values (Fig.2c) shows the ready formation of polymers up to pH 5.5 but insignificantly so at pH values greater than 6. Above pH 6 there is a much slower conformational transition, with the formation of latent antithrombin (apparent as the heterodimer) and much less polymer formation until pH 10. The effect of pH on the opening of the A-sheet of serpins can also be assessed by the readiness with which they complex with synthetic P14-3 peptides. This is clearly seen in Fig.2d which shows the formation of the binary complex (seen as a 7 m urea stable component) in antithrombin incubated for 12 h at 37° with the P14-3 peptide. The rapid formation of the complex at pH 5 as compared with pH 6 and 7 indicates that the low pH favors sheet opening and hence peptide annealment. Serpins typically have a well defined thermal transition with antithrombin having a melting point (Tm) of 57.6 °C at pH 7.4. Antithrombin differs, however, from the archetypal serpin α1-antitrypsin in that its Tmundergoes an atypical change with pH (Fig.3a) with a transition at apparent pKa of 6.0 ± 0.1 (Fig.3b). A transition at pH 6 was similarly observed with guanidine chloride-induced antithrombin unfolding (data not shown). The inflection point at pH 6 suggested that the thermal stability of antithrombin was dependent on the protonation of an individual histidine residue, with the likely candidate being His-334. This histidine is uniquely exposed in antithrombin, which has a partially opened A-sheet, with His-334 forming the first interlinking H-bonds between s3A and s5A (Fig. 1, b and c). By comparison, in α1-antitrypsin, which is more thermally stable with Tm 63.4, His-334 is protected by the full closure of strands 3 and 5 in the A-sheet. To confirm that this difference in pH dependence is related to the exposure of His-334, the change in Tm was determined with a closed A-sheet conformation of antithrombin. Closure of the A-sheet of antithrombin was induced by addition of the core heparin pentasaccharide, which has been shown to result in full closure of the A-sheet with burial of His-334 to give a conformation of antithrombin superimposable with that of α1-antitrypsin (31Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3c, addition of the heparin pentasaccharide to antithrombin results in an increased thermal stability with conversion to a pH dependence curve similar to that of α1-antitrypsin and without the inflection at pH 6. To assess the contribution of His-334 to the stability of α1-antitrypsin, variants were expressed recombinantly with substitutions of His-334 by serine and alanine and with the variants named here as Wt for the wild type and H334S and H334A, respectively, for the variants. Both α1-antitrypsin variants retain their inhibitory activity and form stable complexes with trypsin identical to those of Wt (Fig.4a), and rates and stoichiometries of trypsin inhibition were unchanged (data not shown). Incubation of H334A for 1 h at a range of temperatures showed substantial polymerization at 45 °C, some 5–10 °C prior to equivalent polymerization of the recombinant Wt α1-antitrypsin (Fig. 4b). The H334S variant had a smaller increase in polymerization, intermediate between the Wt and H334A forms. The more ready opening of the A-sheet of H334Aversus Wt α1-antitrypsin is shown by the increased rate of peptide (P7-2) insertion with the H334A variant (Fig.4c). The inherent change in stability of the three forms is reflected in their thermal stability, with a decrease from aTm of 63.4 °C in Wt α1-antitrypsin to 59.6 °C in H334S and to 58.2 °C in H334A. The H334A mutant has a similar pH-dependentTm curve to those of antitrypsin and antithrombin-heparin pentasaccharide complexes (data not shown). This indicates that the transitions between pH 4 and 5.5 (Fig. 3,b and c) do not represent the protonation of His-334, which is consistent with the burial of His-334 both in antitrypsin and heparin-pentasaccharide-complexed antithrombin. A crystallographic finding, reported here (PDB accession number 1LK6), provides an unexpected insight with particular relevance to His-334. The finding was incidental to the determination of the structure of a ternary complex of antithrombin as part of a larger 2A. Zhou, P. E. Stein, J. A. Huntington, and R. W. Carrell, unpublished data. series of serpin-peptide complex structures. The ternary complex was formed by incubation of antithrombin with P14-9 and P6-4 synthetic loop peptides in the presence of glycerol. The 2.8 Å structure shows a glycerol molecule sited in the position occupied in six-stranded antithrombin by the side chain of threonine P8 (Fig. 1, d and e). Critically, a hydroxyl of the glycerol forms a hydrogen bond with the δ nitrogen of the His-334 imidazole with the bond length of 2.9 Å being identical t"

PSA chains structurally identical to the bacterial α2,8-linked capsular polysaccharides are also synthesized by the mammalian central nervous system, where they regulate neuronal function in association with the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Despite the structural identity between bacterial and NCAM PSAs, the respective polysialyltransferases (polySTs) responsible for polymerizing sialyl residues from donor CMP-sialic acid are not homologous glycosyltransferases. To better define the mechanism of capsule biosynthesis, we established the functional interchangeability of bacterial polySTs by complementation of a polymerase-deficient E. coli K1 mutant with the polyST genes from groups B or C N. meningitidis and the control E. coli K92 polymerase gene. The biochemical and immunochemical results demonstrated that linkage specificity is dictated solely by the source of the polymerase structural gene. To determine the molecular basis for linkage specificity, we created chimeras of the K1 and K92 polySTs by overlap extension PCR. Exchanging the first 52 N-terminal amino acids of the K1 NeuS with the C terminus of the K92 homologue did not alter specificity of the resulting chimera, whereas exchanging the first 85 or reciprocally exchanging the first 100 residues did. These results demonstrated that linkage specificity is dependent on residues located between positions 53 and 85 from the N terminus. Site-directed mutagenesis of the K92 polyST N terminus indicated that no single residue alteration was sufficient to affect specificity, consistent with the proposed function of this domain in orienting the acceptor. The combined results provide the first evidence for residues critical to acceptor binding and elongation in polysialyltransferase.

Despite extensive investigation of PSA biosynthesis, including identification of the polySTs catalyzing the polymerization of sialyl residues, we do not know how PSA synthesis is initiated, how chain extension is terminated, or how polySTs interact with donor (CMP-Neu5Ac) and acceptor (nascent PSA) substrates. In contrast, all mammalian sialyltransferases investigated to date include a common primary structural motif (the L, or large sialyl motif consisting of 48 or 49 amino acid residues), which is thought to function in donor binding, and an S (small)-sialyl motif of 23 amino acid residues believed to bind both donor and acceptor substrates (5Datta A.K.

Despite the structural identity between bacterial and mammalian PSA, the respective polySTs are not homologous glycosyltransferases, indicating the existence of at least two origins if not completely different mechanisms of sialyl homopolymer biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of bacterial PSA is thought to take place on the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane through the polyST-catalyzed addition of Neu5Ac residues from CMP-Neu5Ac donor to the nonreducing ends of nascent (acceptor) PSA chains. The functions of most of the proteins required for biosynthesis (encoded by the neugenes) have been identified (8Vimr E.R. Steenbergen S. Cieslewicz M. J. Industrial Microbiol. 1995; 15: 352-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), including those needed for Neu5Ac synthesis, activation, and polymerization (see Fig. 1). Epistasis analysis and complementation experiments showed that polymerase activity is dependent on the structural integrity of the polysaccharide translocation and capsule assembly apparatus (9Vimr E.R. Aaronson W. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 172: 1106-1117Crossref Google Scholar, 10Vimr E.R. Steenbergen S.M. Roth J. Rutishauser U. Troy II, F.A. Polysialic Acid, from Microbes to Man. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1993: 73-91Google Scholar), suggesting the multiprotein complex diagramed below in Fig. 1. Using an immunological approach, a similar conclusion was reached for biosynthesis of the K5 capsule (11Hodson N. Griffiths G. Cook N. Pourhossein M. Gottfridson E. Lind T. Lidholt K. Roberts I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27311-27315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Arrecubieta C. Hammarton T. Barrett B. Charesonsudjai S. Hodson N. Rainey D. Roberts I.S. J. Biol.

Thus, K1 or K5 mutants with defects in conserved polypeptides encoded by the kps genes exhibit reduced rates of polymerization and accumulate intracellular (untranslocated) polysaccharides. Our working hypothesis, that polymerization is closely linked to translocation through protein-protein and protein-polysaccharide interactions, is supported by the apparent processivity of polyST and the loss or reduction of activity when polyST is expressed in the absence of other neu orkps gene products. Understanding how capsular polysaccharide production is regulated requires knowledge of polyST function. To extend our analysis of polyST function, we carried out heterologous complementation experiments, establishing the interchangeability of polymerases for PSA expression in an E. coli K1 polyST-deficient recipient and providing direct evidence for the exclusive role of the polymerases in specifying all known PSA linkages. Then, on the basis of primary structural similarities, we created reciprocal chimeras between the K1 and K92 polySTs to identify the enzymic domains conferring linkage specificity. Site-directed alteration of selected K1 or K92 polyST residues provided additional functional information. The results extend our earlier conclusion that the K92 polyST is a bifunctional enzyme (13Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), demonstrate for the first time cross-species complementation of neuS, and establish the domain organization of the K1 and K92 enzymes responsible for specifying product linkage. These conclusions provide an experimental scaffold for future studies aimed at better understanding the functions of polySTs and the regulation of PSA biosynthesis in bacteria, neurons, and tumor cells. Laboratory E. coli K-12 strain DH5α was used as the recipient for all molecular cloning of the various polyST structural genes. E. coli K1 hybrid strains EV136 (neuS::Tn10) and EV240 (neuS::Tn10 nanA4) are derivatives of the wild type strain EV36 (13Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas RS218 is a clinical K1 isolate kindly provided by Dr. R. Silver of the University of Rochester School of Medicine, Rochester, NY. These strains do not synthesize a PSA capsule due to insertional inactivation of the polyST structural gene, neuS, but retain all other genetic information for precursor biosynthesis, polymer assembly, and PSA translocation. The nonpolar nanA4 mutation inactivates sialate lyase (aldolase), thus the strain cannot degrade free sialic acid. EV239 is aneuB25 relative of EV240 and will not synthesize PSA even with neuS+ expressed in trans, unless provided with an exogenous source of free Neu5Ac, because of the loss of sialate synthase activity encoded by neuB (13Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EV136 and EV240 synthesize PSA when neuS+ is provided intrans by transformation with either pSX92 or pSX305, encoding polySTs from E. coli K1 or K92 wild type strains (Fig. 2), respectively (13Steenbergen S.M.

H46 is specific for a minimal epitope of approximately eight α2,8-linked Neu5Ac residues, whereas αGpC recognizes the α2,9 linkages in PSAs from E. coli K92 or group C meningococci. Bacterial colonies that synthesize and export capsular polysaccharides on agar plates supplemented with 10% (v/v) antiserum produce precipitin halos that are indicative of PSA linkage (chemotype). endo-N was purified from phage K1F lysates as previously described (18Petter J.G.

Endogenous or exogenous polyST activity was determined in a total reaction volume of 15 μl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm magnesium acetate, and 5 mm dithiothreitol as described previously (9Vimr E.R. Aaronson W. Silver R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 172: 1106-1117Crossref Google Scholar, 13Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J.

Microbiol. 1990; 4: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that CMP-[4-14C]Neu5Ac (55 mCi mmol−1) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Data were expressed as picomoles of Neu5Ac transferred per unit of time per milligram of protein. Transfer to exogenous acceptors was normalized per milligram of acceptor. Neu5Ac tritiated on carbon-6 was obtained from CMP-[6-3H]Neu5Ac (20 Ci mol−1) by acid hydrolysis as previously described (18Petter J.G. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4354-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overlap extension PCR for the construction of genes encoding chimeric polypeptides was carried out as originally described (19Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). In two separate PCR amplifications, double-stranded fragments are generated and subsequently fused in PCR reaction 3. PCR reaction 1 uses a common 5′-far primer located 152 bases from the ATG start codons of either the K92 or K1neuS genes (5′-GCCGCCAAATGTTAATGTTAGGAC-3′), and the unique reverse overlap primer (Table I) that carries information for constructing the intended chimera. In PCR reaction 2, a 3′-far primer located 175 bases from the stop codon of either the K92 or K1 neuS genes (5′-CGGTTTATTATGGGGGGAACACAA-3′) and a primer that is the perfect complement of the overlap primer used in PCR reaction 1 (forward primers, Table I) are used to generate the second, or C-terminal fragment. When these two PCR products are mixed, denatured, and cooled the complementary overlaps anneal and the junction is extended by the template-dependent DNA polymerase. Finally, nested primers (5′-near and 3′-near) amplify the fragment bearing the chimeric construction and are cloned in pGEM-T Easy. The near primers are as follows: K1–5′-near, 5′-GGACTTTTGGAATTAAAAGATCTAC-3′; K92–5′-near, 5′-GGACTTTTGGAATTAAAAGATCGA-3′; K1–3′-near, 5′-CCATCCTCTTCAAAGAAAAGTAAC-3′; and K92–3′-near, 5′-GCATCCTCTTCAAAGAAA- AGTTAC-3′.Table ISpecific primers used for chimeric enzyme synthesis and mutagenesis by overlap extension PCRConstructForward primer1-aSlashes in parentheses indicate the position of overlap junctions between neuS homologues.,1-bResidues in parentheses indicate specific base change included in the primer for site-directed mutagenesis.Reverse primerpSX611, pSX612, and pSX6145′-AATAGTAGTTTGTATGAAGAAAA(/)TAA TTTATTATTTATTTGTTCA-3′5′-TGAACAAATAAATAATAAATTA(/)TTT TCTTCATACAAACTACTATT-3′pSX613 and pSX6155′-AATAGTACCTTGTATGAAGAAAA CAAC(/)TTTTTATTCATTTGCTCA-3′5′-TGAGCAAATGAATAAAAAGTTG(/)TTT TCTTCATACAAGGTACTATT-3′pSX6165′-AATCATTTGCTCAAGAATTAAT(T)TT GGCATTTGAGTGTTTTTTTT-3′5′-AAAAAAAACACTGAAATGCCAA(A) ATTAATTCTTGAGCAAATGAAT-3′pSX6175′-TGACGATTTAACTAATGGAATA(CC)T TTAAACTCAAAAATTTTTTT-3′5′-AAAAAAATTTTTGAGTTTAAA(GG) TATTCCATTAGTTAAATCGTCA-3′pSX6185′-TATAAAAACTCTTGCGTTATCAG(G)T TTATCTATTCTCATCAAGGT-3′5′-ACCTTGATGAGAATAGATAAA(C)C TGATAACGCAAGAGTTTTTATA-3′pSX6195′-TTTGTATGAAGAAAACAACTTATT(A) TTCATTTGCTCAAGAATTAA-3′5′-TTAATTCTTGAGCAAATGAATAA(T) AAGTTGTTTTCTTCATACAAA-3′pSX6205′-CTTGTATGAAGAAAATAATTT(T)TTA TTTATTTGTTCAACAATAAT-3′5′-ATTATTGTTGAACAAATAAATAA(A) AAATTATTTTCTTCATACAAG-3′pSX6215′-CATTTGCTCAAGAATTAATCTT(/)GG CATCTCAGTATTTTTTTCAGT-3′5′-ACTGAAAAAAATACTGAGATGCC(/) AAGATTAATTCTTGAGCAAATG-3′pSX6225′-CTCTGCTTTCTTTAATTGCCCTAAATG (/)ACTAATTATAAAAATATT-3′5′-AATATTTTTATAATTAGT(/)CAT TTAGGGCAATTAAAGAAAGCAGAG-3′pSX6235′-TCTGCTTTCTTTAATTGCCCTAAAT(T) AGCAACAATAAAAATATTT-3′5′-AAATATTTTTATTGTTGCT(A)ATT TAGGGCAATTAAAGAAAGCAGA-3′1-a Slashes in parentheses indicate the position of overlap junctions between neuS homologues.1-b Residues in parentheses indicate specific base change included in the primer for site-directed mutagenesis. Open table in a new tab Sufficient flanking DNA sequence was available for constructions involving K1 neuS (accession number M76370), but there was insufficient 3′-flanking data to construct chimeras fusing the C terminus of K92 NeuS (accession number M88479) to the N terminus of the K1 enzyme. Therefore, we sequenced pSX305 with a primer (5′-ATTAGCATCATCTTCTTTGGT-3′) identical to bp 1002–1022 of K92neuS to yield the 529 bp of new sequence 3′ to the K92neuS stop codon. These new sequence data are deposited under accession number AF318310. The conditions used for the first round of PCR were 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s interspersed at 60–65 °C for 30 s for annealing (this annealing temperature was optimized within the indicated range as determined individually for each primer set) and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. PCR reaction 3 was 35 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s. All primers (synthesized and PAGE-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.) were used at a concentration of 50 pmol reaction−1. Templates used for the first round of PCR were either the K1 (pSX92) or K92 (pSX305) neuS genes. In the second round of amplification, PCR reaction 3, 1 μl of each first round reaction was added as template. Taq polymerase was used in the PCR reactions for the initial set of chimeric polySTs. DNA sequencing of these constructs revealed unintended base changes introduced by the polymerase. Therefore, all subsequent amplifications were carried out using the PCR SuperMix High Fidelity purchased from Invitrogen. This PCR mix is a combination of the proofreading polymerase from Pyrococcus sp. GB-D andTaq DNA polymerase. After verification of product formation the PCR product was purified using the Wizard PCR Prep DNA purification system from Promega. After purification the products were A-tailed and cloned into the pGEM-T Easy Vector following the manufacturer's directions and transformed into DH5α for further analysis or storage. All constructs were sequenced using the pUC/M13 Forward and Reverse primers to verify the junction formed and to ensure no unplanned mutations were introduced during PCR amplifications. Any construct with an altered phenotype was completely sequenced on both strands using the previously named universal primers as well as threeneuS-specific primers that allowed complete double-stranded sequencing in two to three more reactions. DNA sequencing was carried out at the University of Illinois Keck Center for Biotechnology using standard automated sequencing and data retrieval systems. The plasmids were transformed into EV240 to test for polyST activity. Mutagenesis of the K1 or K92neuS genes was performed either by overlap extension (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) or using the Altered Sites II in vitro Mutagenesis System fromPromega, in which the BglII-BamHI fragments of pSX92 or pSX305 were cloned into the mutagenesis vector. The primers used for the mutagenesis reactions by overlap extension are listed in Table I. The other mutagenic primers with their respective plasmids are as follows: pSX624, 5′-TCTTGGCATTTCAGTGTTTTTTTCAGTTGCCAAGACGATAAGAAA-3′; pSX625, 5′-CCTACTAAATTTTTGTATAAATGACTCTGCTTTCTTTAATTGCCC-3′; pSX626, 5′-GACGATAAGAAAATTACTACGCTTACTAAATTTTTGTATAAAAAG-3′; where the underlined residues indicate the base(s) altered to make the desired mutant polySTs. All mutant neuS copies were sequenced as described above to ensure that only the intended alteration was introduced by the mutagenesis. In addition to the immunological analysis of PSA chemotypes with linkage-specific antisera described above, sensitivity to K1-specific phage was used to confirm the synthesis of α2,8 sialyl linkages by plaque assay. Strains synthesizing K1 or K92 capsules are sensitive to bacteriophage infection and produce a characteristic plaque phenotype (21Cieslewicz M. Vimr E. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 237-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Where indicated, linkage assignments were confirmed by endo-N digestion and TLC analysis on silica gel G (Merck Research Laboratories) in an isopropanol, ammonium hydroxide, water (6:1:2) solvent system as previously described (18Petter J.G. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4354-4363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sialyl oligomers of defined length for use as chromatography standards were produced by partial acid hydrolysis of colominic acid as previously described (22Vimr E.R. McCoy R.D. Vollger H.F. Wilkison N.C. Troy F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1971-1975Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Oligomers were identified colorimetrically with orcinol or by autoradiography using a Kodak BioMax Transcreeen LE intensifying screen for 14C-labeled sialic acids or Dupont Cronex Quanta-III intensifying screen after autoradiographic enhancement with Fluoro-Hance (rpi Research Products, Mount Prospect, IL). We previously showed that when neuS is expressed in an E. coli K-12 strain such as DH5α, a genetic background lacking the kps and neu genes for capsule biosynthesis (Fig. 1), polyST is unable to initiate PSA synthesis in vitro but transfers Neu5Ac from CMP-Neu5Ac to the exogenous acceptor colominic acid (13Steenbergen S.M. Wrona T.J. Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Steenbergen S.M. Vimr E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As expected from these previous results, we observed that neither K92 neuS nor synD or synE expressed a polyST that was capable of initiating PSA synthesis in the K-12 background when provided with an in vitro source of the nucleotide sugar donor, CMP-Neu5Ac (TableII). A control plasmid (pUE14) expressing the group B meningococcal CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase encoded bysynB (Fig. 2), as expected, also had no polyST activity (Table II). In contrast, each of the recombinant polySTs expressed in E. coli K-12 transferred sialyl residues from CMP-Neu5Ac to both the cognate and heterologous exogenous acceptors, although with different relative efficiencies (Table II), indicating that at least for exogenous acceptors the mechanism of acceptor binding does not absolutely discriminate on the basis of sialyl linkage. Addition of monomeric Neu5Ac to the extracts as a potential exogenous acceptor did not result in polyST activities above the no-acceptor controls, indicating that none of the polySTs tested could use free sialic acid as exogenous acceptor. We concluded that all bacterial polySTs possess structurally similar acceptor binding sites. However, exogenous sialyl oligomers are poorly elongated (23Vimr E.R. Bassler B. Troy F.A. Abst. Ann. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1985; K152: 154Google Scholar, 24Ferrero M.A. Luengo J.M. Reglero A. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Chao C.-F. Chaung H.-C.

Troy F.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11427-11431Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, broadly extrapolating results derived from the use of exogenous acceptors to natural PSA elongation may be suspect to misinterpretation because of the failure to duplicate the in vivo process. To overcome the problems inherent with these in vitro systems we developed an in vivo complementation system that permits the detection of polyST activity under isogenic conditions.Table IIExogenous polyST activity expressed in E. coli K-12PlasmidRelevant genotypePolyST activity with2-aData are normalized (except the no acceptor control) to 1 mg of acceptor per assay.No acceptor2-bActivities are comparable to E. coli K-12 strain DH5α with no plasmids.CABos-12GpCpmol/mg proteinpUE14synB1.20.4ND2-cND, not determined.NDpUE3synD0.6471365NDpSX92K1neuS1.612001694 ± 1062-dS.D. between independent measurements.NDpSX305K92 neuS0.9671308100pSX316synE4.2662878039802-a Data are normalized (except the no acceptor control) to 1 mg of acceptor per assay.2-b Activities are comparable to E. coli K-12 strain DH5α with no plasmids.2-c ND, not determined.2-d S.D. between independent measurements.

Similarly, a double mutant with defects in neuB and nanA is dependent on an exogenous source of free Neu5Ac for PSA biosynthesis due to lack of an active synthase encoded by neuB (15Vimr E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6191-6197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.3 shows the time course of PSA synthesis when strain EV138 (nanA4 neuB25) is continuously pulsed with exogenous radiolabeled Neu5Ac. The sialic acid internalized by the sialate permease encoded by nanT is spared from the catabolic pathway by inactivation of sialate lyase (nanA) and thus can only participate as an intermediate in PSA biosynthesis (27Vimr E.R. Troy F.A. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 854-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ringenberg M.C. Lichtensteiger C. Vimr E.R. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The internalized Neu5Ac is activated for glycosyltransfer by the synthetase encoded by neuA, which couples Neu5Ac with CTP to produce intracellular CMP-Neu5Ac detectable by 5 min after beginning the pulse (Fig. 3). PSA steadily accumulated at the origin of the chromatogram without observable intermediates. The solvent system used for the TLC analysis separates Neu5Ac monomers through oligomers of about 10 sialyl units in length. The absence of detectable oligomeric sialic acid in vivo is consistent with the processive activity of polyST inferred previously from in vitro results (23Vimr E.R. Bassler B. Troy F.A. Abst. Ann. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol. 1985; K152: 154Google Scholar, 24Ferrero M.A. Luengo J.M. Reglero A. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 575-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Chao C.-F. Chaung H.-C.

The simplest interpretation of the current results is that PSA is elongated processively in vivo by a single polyST before chain termination by an unknown mechanism. To determine if all extant bacterial PSA chemotypes were dependent on the genetic origin of their cognate polymerases, we carried out complementation experiments with the neuS homologuessynD or synE from N. meningitidisgroups B and C, respectively (Fig. 2). The immunoreactivities of the resulting polysaccharide products confirmed that polyST linkage specificity is retained when these enzymes catalyzed PSA synthesis in the heterologous mutant K1 background (TableIII).

All three GGAs (1, 2, and 3) bind to the mannose 6-phosphate receptor tail via their VHS domains, as well as to the adaptor protein complex-1 via their hinge domains. The latter interaction has been proposed to be important for cooperative packaging of cargo into forming clathrin-coated carriers at the trans-Golgi network. Here we present evidence that GGA1 function is highly regulated by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Cell fractionation showed that the phosphorylated pool of GGA1 resided predominantly in the cytosol and that recruitment onto membranes was associated with dephosphorylation. Okadaic acid inhibition studies and in vitro dephosphorylation assays indicated that dephosphorylation is mediated by a protein phosphatase 2A-like phosphatase. Dephosphorylation of GGA1 induced a change in the conformation to an “open” form as measured by gel filtration and sucrose gradient analyses. This was associated with enhanced binding to ligands because of release of autoinhibition and increased binding to the adaptor protein complex-1 γ-appendage.

All three GGAs bind to an acidic cluster dileucine (AC-LL) sorting motif on the cytoplasmic tails of the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) via their VHS domains (8Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C.

Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the GGAs differ from each other in certain aspects. GGAs 1 and 3, but not GGA 2, are subject to autoinhibition mediated by binding of internal AC-LL motifs to the ligand binding site on the VHS domain (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This autoinhibition requires phosphorylation of a casein kinase 2 (CK2) site just upstream of the internal AC-LL (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby the autoinhibition is relieved to enable GGAs 1 and 3 to function in cargo binding has not been examined.Recent evidence indicates that the GGAs cooperate with AP-1 in the sorting and packaging of the MPR cargo molecules into clathrin-coated carriers. Immunoelectron microscopic studies showed that the GGAs and AP-1 co-localize within clathrin-coated buds and vesicles at the TGN (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Puertollano R. van der Wel N.N. Green L.E. Eisenberg E. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar) and live cell fluorescent imaging has revealed that the GGAs and AP-1 exit the TGN in the same clathrin-coated tubules (13Puertollano R. van der Wel N.N. Green L.E. Eisenberg E. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition to these morphologic studies, in vitrobinding assays have provided evidence for a direct interaction between the hinge domains of GGAs and the γ-appendage of AP-1 (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression of a truncated form of GGA, lacking the hinge domain that mediates AP-1 interaction, caused accumulation of CD-MPR at the TGN (8Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that the GGAs mediate sorting of MPRs at the TGN and facilitate their entry into forming AP-1-containing clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). In support of this, a mutant MPR that failed to bind GGAs, but did bind AP-1, was poorly incorporated into AP-1-positive clathrin-coated carriers forming at the TGN (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).AP-1 was also shown to possess an associated CK2, which was capable of phosphorylating GGAs 1 and 3 (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The resulting phosphorylation-induced autoinhibition of the ligand binding site on the VHS domain was postulated to cause a directed transfer of the MPR cargo from GGAs 1 and 3 to AP-1. To explain the lack of detectable GGAs in isolated CCVs (2Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the phosphorylated GGAs 1 and 3 return to the cytosol after transferring their cargo to AP-1 (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).In the present study we have examined the regulation of GGAs 1 and 3 phosphorylation. Using in vivo metabolic labeling, we established that membrane-associated GGA1 is predominantly dephosphorylated, whereas the cytosolic pool is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation was associated with a marked change in conformation that favored increased ligand binding as well as binding to the γ-appendage of AP-1. A model is proposed whereby GGAs 1 and 3 function at the TGN is regulated by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation.DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study provide insight into the dynamic nature of the phosphorylation of GGAs 1 and 3 and how this serves to regulate the function of these proteins. We have previously reported that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of serine 355 in the hinge domain of GGA1 results in autoinhibition because of binding of an internal AC-LL motif in the hinge to the ligand binding site in the VHS domain (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also showed that GGA1 (as well as GGAs 2 and 3) interacts directly with AP-1 and that AP-1 contains an associated CK2 that can phosphorylate serine 355 to induce autoinhibition (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The current findings extend these observations in several significant ways. First, we document that the cytosolic form of GGA1 is phosphorylated in both COS cells and Sf9 cells and that the molecule becomes dephosphorylated upon membrane recruitment. This dephosphorylation is prevented by low levels of okadaic acid that have been reported to selectively inhibit PP2A (15Bertrand F. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nanogram amounts of purified PP2A dephosphorylate GGA1. Together these findings implicate PP2A as the phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of GGA1 that occurs upon membrane recruitment. A likely source of the PP2A are the two MPRs that have been reported (and confirmed by us) to have this phosphatase bound to their cytoplasmic tails (17Varlamov O. Kalinina E. Che F.Y. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we show that dephosphorylation of GGA1 causes three measurable effects: a change in conformation to a larger or “open” form, an increase in binding avidity toward AC-LL ligands, and an increase in binding to the γ appendage of AP-1. Whereas GGA1 has at least three sites of phosphorylation,2 we found that the phosphorylation status of serine 355 was the key determinant in all three effects.The large conformational change in GGA1 that is induced by dephosphorylation of serine 355 is very striking. The increase in Stokes radius of ∼20 Å may be contributed by the flexible hinge domain as it moves out of the VHS ligand binding groove that it had previously occupied in the phosphorylated/autoinhibited state. This would explain that mechanism of release of the autoinhibition. The unoccupied VHS ligand binding groove will now be available for interacting with the AC-LL on the MPR cytoplasmic tail (18Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Shiba T. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Kawasaki M. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Earnest T. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a phosphoserine in the CI-MPR COOH-terminal sequence DDpSDEDLLHI enhances binding to the VHS domain by fitting into the binding groove for the AC-LL motif (20Kato Y. Misra S. Puertollano R. Hurley J.H. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 532-536PubMed Google Scholar). Serine 355 is located two residues further upstream from the AC-LL motif in the GGA1 hinge. Therefore at this point it is not clear whether the phosphorylated serine 355 binds directly to the VHS domain or induces a conformational change that favors binding of the downstream AC-LL motif to the VHS binding groove. Either way, phosphorylation of serine 355 enhances binding of the hinge motif to the VHS domain, resulting in a “closed” or autoinhibited form of the molecule. When this occurs, the region of the hinge that interacts with the γ appendage of AP-1 appears to become less accessible because binding to the γ appendage is greatly impaired.We have previously proposed a working model for how the GGAs may cooperate with AP-1 in the packaging of MPRs into clathrin-coated transport carriers at the TGN (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The current findings allow us to refine and extend the model as depicted in Fig.6. Autoinhibited phosphorylated GGAs 1 and 3 are recruited from the cytosol onto the Golgi via ARF·GTP (21Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) where they encounter the MPRs on smooth membranes (panels Aand B). PP2A bound to the cytoplasmic tails of the MPRs could dephosphorylate the GGAs, triggering a large intramolecular rearrangement whereby the flexible hinge domain moves out of the VHS ligand binding groove (panel C). This relieves the autoinhibition and allows the unoccupied VHS to interact with the AC-LL motifs of the MPRs (panel D). The GGA-MPR complex could then interact with AP-1 in forming clathrin-coated buds via binding of the GGA hinge to the AP-1 γ-appendage (panel E). This association could possibly be stabilized by common binding partners, including γ-synergin (7Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Page L.J. Sowerby P.J. Lui W.W. Robinson M.S. J.

Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The AP-1-associated CK2 could then act on GGAs 1 and 3 and the MPRs (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 18833-18842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the GGA hinge will restore the ability of the internal AC-LL motif to bind to the VHS domain, thereby serving as a competitive inhibitor to release the bound MPR (panel F). The displaced MPR can then bind to AP-1. This binding will be enhanced by phosphorylation of CK2 sites present in the cytoplasmic tails of both MPRs (24Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) an event that is closely associated with their exit from the TGN (28Meresse S. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At some point during this process, the μ1 subunit of AP-1 is also phosphorylated (27Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This causes a conformational change that enhances binding to the MPR cytoplasmic tails. The combination of increased ligand binding avidity by AP-1 with impaired ligand binding by GGAs 1 and 3 would favor the directed transfer of MPR cargo molecules from the GGAs to AP-1. As the clathrin-coated bud extends and incorporates more AP-1 molecules, the MPRs become trapped in the CCVs. The phosphorylated GGAs 1 and 3, on the other hand, would be expected to return to the cytosol (panel G). This could explain why the GGAs have been undetectable in isolated CCVs whereas AP-1 is highly concentrated in these structures (2Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).The rate of formation of the CCVs may be governed by the MPR concentration (cargo load) (29Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Once the CCVs bud from the TGN, a cytosolic form of PP2A plays a role in the “uncoating” process by dephosphorylating the μ1 subunit of AP-1 (27Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This allows the AP-1 to dissociate from the vesicle following clathrin release (27Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The phosphoregulation of these various protein-protein interactions would be expected to enhance the efficiency of sorting and packaging of cargo molecules into AP-1 transport carriers. It is curious that GGA2, in contrast to GGAs 1 and 3, is not phosphorylated and does not appear to be subject to autoinhibition (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Perhaps its function is regulated by another form of post-translational modification. Alternatively, GGA2 may somehow act in conjunction with GGAs 1 and 3 on the membrane and not require its own regulation. We plan to explore this issue in further studies.

All three GGAs bind to an acidic cluster dileucine (AC-LL) sorting motif on the cytoplasmic tails of the two mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) via their VHS domains (8Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C.

Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, the GGAs differ from each other in certain aspects. GGAs 1 and 3, but not GGA 2, are subject to autoinhibition mediated by binding of internal AC-LL motifs to the ligand binding site on the VHS domain (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This autoinhibition requires phosphorylation of a casein kinase 2 (CK2) site just upstream of the internal AC-LL (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The mechanism whereby the autoinhibition is relieved to enable GGAs 1 and 3 to function in cargo binding has not been examined.

Immunoelectron microscopic studies showed that the GGAs and AP-1 co-localize within clathrin-coated buds and vesicles at the TGN (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Puertollano R. van der Wel N.N. Green L.E. Eisenberg E. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar) and live cell fluorescent imaging has revealed that the GGAs and AP-1 exit the TGN in the same clathrin-coated tubules (13Puertollano R. van der Wel N.N. Green L.E. Eisenberg E. Peters P.J. Bonifacino J.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). In addition to these morphologic studies, in vitrobinding assays have provided evidence for a direct interaction between the hinge domains of GGAs and the γ-appendage of AP-1 (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression of a truncated form of GGA, lacking the hinge domain that mediates AP-1 interaction, caused accumulation of CD-MPR at the TGN (8Puertollano R. Aguilar R.C. Gorshkova I. Crouch R.J. Bonifacino J.S. Science. 2001; 292: 1712-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that the GGAs mediate sorting of MPRs at the TGN and facilitate their entry into forming AP-1-containing clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs). In support of this, a mutant MPR that failed to bind GGAs, but did bind AP-1, was poorly incorporated into AP-1-positive clathrin-coated carriers forming at the TGN (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). AP-1 was also shown to possess an associated CK2, which was capable of phosphorylating GGAs 1 and 3 (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The resulting phosphorylation-induced autoinhibition of the ligand binding site on the VHS domain was postulated to cause a directed transfer of the MPR cargo from GGAs 1 and 3 to AP-1. To explain the lack of detectable GGAs in isolated CCVs (2Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the phosphorylated GGAs 1 and 3 return to the cytosol after transferring their cargo to AP-1 (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In the present study we have examined the regulation of GGAs 1 and 3 phosphorylation. Using in vivo metabolic labeling, we established that membrane-associated GGA1 is predominantly dephosphorylated, whereas the cytosolic pool is phosphorylated. Dephosphorylation was associated with a marked change in conformation that favored increased ligand binding as well as binding to the γ-appendage of AP-1. A model is proposed whereby GGAs 1 and 3 function at the TGN is regulated by cycles of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. DISCUSSIONThe data presented in this study provide insight into the dynamic nature of the phosphorylation of GGAs 1 and 3 and how this serves to regulate the function of these proteins. We have previously reported that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of serine 355 in the hinge domain of GGA1 results in autoinhibition because of binding of an internal AC-LL motif in the hinge to the ligand binding site in the VHS domain (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also showed that GGA1 (as well as GGAs 2 and 3) interacts directly with AP-1 and that AP-1 contains an associated CK2 that can phosphorylate serine 355 to induce autoinhibition (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The current findings extend these observations in several significant ways. First, we document that the cytosolic form of GGA1 is phosphorylated in both COS cells and Sf9 cells and that the molecule becomes dephosphorylated upon membrane recruitment. This dephosphorylation is prevented by low levels of okadaic acid that have been reported to selectively inhibit PP2A (15Bertrand F. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nanogram amounts of purified PP2A dephosphorylate GGA1. Together these findings implicate PP2A as the phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of GGA1 that occurs upon membrane recruitment. A likely source of the PP2A are the two MPRs that have been reported (and confirmed by us) to have this phosphatase bound to their cytoplasmic tails (17Varlamov O. Kalinina E. Che F.Y. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we show that dephosphorylation of GGA1 causes three measurable effects: a change in conformation to a larger or “open” form, an increase in binding avidity toward AC-LL ligands, and an increase in binding to the γ appendage of AP-1. Whereas GGA1 has at least three sites of phosphorylation,2 we found that the phosphorylation status of serine 355 was the key determinant in all three effects.The large conformational change in GGA1 that is induced by dephosphorylation of serine 355 is very striking. The increase in Stokes radius of ∼20 Å may be contributed by the flexible hinge domain as it moves out of the VHS ligand binding groove that it had previously occupied in the phosphorylated/autoinhibited state. This would explain that mechanism of release of the autoinhibition. The unoccupied VHS ligand binding groove will now be available for interacting with the AC-LL on the MPR cytoplasmic tail (18Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H.

Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a phosphoserine in the CI-MPR COOH-terminal sequence DDpSDEDLLHI enhances binding to the VHS domain by fitting into the binding groove for the AC-LL motif (20Kato Y. Misra S. Puertollano R. Hurley J.H. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 532-536PubMed Google Scholar). Serine 355 is located two residues further upstream from the AC-LL motif in the GGA1 hinge. Therefore at this point it is not clear whether the phosphorylated serine 355 binds directly to the VHS domain or induces a conformational change that favors binding of the downstream AC-LL motif to the VHS binding groove.

As the clathrin-coated bud extends and incorporates more AP-1 molecules, the MPRs become trapped in the CCVs. The phosphorylated GGAs 1 and 3, on the other hand, would be expected to return to the cytosol (panel G). This could explain why the GGAs have been undetectable in isolated CCVs whereas AP-1 is highly concentrated in these structures (2Hirst J. Lui W.W. Bright N.A. Totty N. Seaman M.N. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 67-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar).The rate of formation of the CCVs may be governed by the MPR concentration (cargo load) (29Le Borgne R. Hoflack B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Once the CCVs bud from the TGN, a cytosolic form of PP2A plays a role in the “uncoating” process by dephosphorylating the μ1 subunit of AP-1 (27Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This allows the AP-1 to dissociate from the vesicle following clathrin release (27Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).The phosphoregulation of these various protein-protein interactions would be expected to enhance the efficiency of sorting and packaging of cargo molecules into AP-1 transport carriers. It is curious that GGA2, in contrast to GGAs 1 and 3, is not phosphorylated and does not appear to be subject to autoinhibition (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Perhaps its function is regulated by another form of post-translational modification. Alternatively, GGA2 may somehow act in conjunction with GGAs 1 and 3 on the membrane and not require its own regulation. We plan to explore this issue in further studies. The data presented in this study provide insight into the dynamic nature of the phosphorylation of GGAs 1 and 3 and how this serves to regulate the function of these proteins. We have previously reported that CK2-mediated phosphorylation of serine 355 in the hinge domain of GGA1 results in autoinhibition because of binding of an internal AC-LL motif in the hinge to the ligand binding site in the VHS domain (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We also showed that GGA1 (as well as GGAs 2 and 3) interacts directly with AP-1 and that AP-1 contains an associated CK2 that can phosphorylate serine 355 to induce autoinhibition (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The current findings extend these observations in several significant ways. First, we document that the cytosolic form of GGA1 is phosphorylated in both COS cells and Sf9 cells and that the molecule becomes dephosphorylated upon membrane recruitment. This dephosphorylation is prevented by low levels of okadaic acid that have been reported to selectively inhibit PP2A (15Bertrand F. Turowski P. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13856-13863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 16Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nanogram amounts of purified PP2A dephosphorylate GGA1. Together these findings implicate PP2A as the phosphatase responsible for the dephosphorylation of GGA1 that occurs upon membrane recruitment. A likely source of the PP2A are the two MPRs that have been reported (and confirmed by us) to have this phosphatase bound to their cytoplasmic tails (17Varlamov O. Kalinina E. Che F.Y. Fricker L.D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 311-322PubMed Google Scholar). Second, we show that dephosphorylation of GGA1 causes three measurable effects: a change in conformation to a larger or “open” form, an increase in binding avidity toward AC-LL ligands, and an increase in binding to the γ appendage of AP-1. Whereas GGA1 has at least three sites of phosphorylation,2 we found that the phosphorylation status of serine 355 was the key determinant in all three effects. The large conformational change in GGA1 that is induced by dephosphorylation of serine 355 is very striking. The increase in Stokes radius of ∼20 Å may be contributed by the flexible hinge domain as it moves out of the VHS ligand binding groove that it had previously occupied in the phosphorylated/autoinhibited state. This would explain that mechanism of release of the autoinhibition. The unoccupied VHS ligand binding groove will now be available for interacting with the AC-LL on the MPR cytoplasmic tail (18Misra S. Puertollano R. Kato Y. Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Nature. 2002; 415: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 19Shiba T. Takatsu H. Nogi T. Matsugaki N. Kawasaki M. Igarashi N. Suzuki M. Kato R. Earnest T. Nakayama K. Wakatsuki S. Nature. 2002; 415: 937-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It has been reported that a phosphoserine in the CI-MPR COOH-terminal sequence DDpSDEDLLHI enhances binding to the VHS domain by fitting into the binding groove for the AC-LL motif (20Kato Y. Misra S. Puertollano R. Hurley J.H. Bonifacino J.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 532-536PubMed Google Scholar). Serine 355 is located two residues further upstream from the AC-LL motif in the GGA1 hinge. Therefore at this point it is not clear whether the phosphorylated serine 355 binds directly to the VHS domain or induces a conformational change that favors binding of the downstream AC-LL motif to the VHS binding groove. Either way, phosphorylation of serine 355 enhances binding of the hinge motif to the VHS domain, resulting in a “closed” or autoinhibited form of the molecule. When this occurs, the region of the hinge that interacts with the γ appendage of AP-1 appears to become less accessible because binding to the γ appendage is greatly impaired. We have previously proposed a working model for how the GGAs may cooperate with AP-1 in the packaging of MPRs into clathrin-coated transport carriers at the TGN (11Doray B. Bruns K. Ghosh P. Kornfeld S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 8072-8077Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The current findings allow us to refine and extend the model as depicted in Fig.6. Autoinhibited phosphorylated GGAs 1 and 3 are recruited from the cytosol onto the Golgi via ARF·GTP (21Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) where they encounter the MPRs on smooth membranes (panels Aand B). PP2A bound to the cytoplasmic tails of the MPRs could dephosphorylate the GGAs, triggering a large intramolecular rearrangement whereby the flexible hinge domain moves out of the VHS ligand binding groove (panel C). This relieves the autoinhibition and allows the unoccupied VHS to interact with the AC-LL motifs of the MPRs (panel D). The GGA-MPR complex could then interact with AP-1 in forming clathrin-coated buds via binding of the GGA hinge to the AP-1 γ-appendage (panel E). This association could possibly be stabilized by common binding partners, including γ-synergin (7Takatsu H. Yoshino K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 271: 719-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Page L.J. Sowerby P.J. Lui W.W. Robinson M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 993-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and clathrin (9Zhu Y. Doray B. Poussu A. Lehto V.P. Kornfeld S. Science. 2001; 292: 1716-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 21Puertollano R. Randazzo P.A. Presley J.F. Hartnell L.M. Bonifacino J.S. Cell. 2001; 105: 93-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The AP-1-associated CK2 could then act on GGAs 1 and 3 and the MPRs (12Doray B. Ghosh P. Griffith J. Geuze H. Kornfeld S. Science. 2002; 297: 1700-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar,23Meresse S. Ludwig T. Frank R. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18833-18842Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the GGA hinge will restore the ability of the internal AC-LL motif to bind to the VHS domain, thereby serving as a competitive inhibitor to release the bound MPR (panel F). The displaced MPR can then bind to AP-1. This binding will be enhanced by phosphorylation of CK2 sites present in the cytoplasmic tails of both MPRs (24Le Borgne R. Schmidt A. Mauxion F. Griffiths G.

https://openalex.org/W2023361082,"Site-directed mutagenesis has been used to investigate the role of glutamic acid 183 in chloroperoxidase catalysis. Based on the x-ray crystallographic structure of chloroperoxidase, Glu-183 is postulated to function on distal side of the heme prosthetic group as an acid-base catalyst in facilitating the reaction between the peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide with the formation of Compound I. In contrast, the other members of the heme peroxidase family use a histidine residue in this role. Plasmids have now been constructed in which the codon for Glu-183 is replaced with a histidine codon. The mutant recombinant gene has been expressed inAspergillus niger. An analysis of the produced mutant gene shows that the substitution of Glu-183 with a His residue is detrimental to the chlorination and dismutation activity of chloroperoxidase. The activity is reduced by 85 and 50% of wild type activity, respectively. However, quite unexpectedly, the epoxidation activity of the mutant enzyme is significantly enhanced ∼2.5-fold. These results show that Glu-183 is important but not essential for the chlorination activity of chloroperoxidase. It is possible that the increased epoxidation of the mutant enzyme is based on an increase in the hydrophobicity of the active site.

Chloroperoxidase (CPO 1The abbreviations used are: CPOchloroperoxidaseIEFisoelectric focusingALAδ-aminolevulinic acid; EC 1.11.1.10) is a heavily glycocylated heme peroxidase secreted from the filamentous fungus Caldariomyces fumago (1Morris D.R.

Natural product research in the 1940s discovered the biosynthesis of chlorinated products by C. fumago (4Clutterbuck P.W. Mukhopadhyay S.L. Oxford A.E. Raistrick H. Biochem. J. 1940; 34: 664-677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Caldariomycin (2,2-dichloro-1,3-cyclopentanediol) is the major chlorinated compound found in C. fumago cultures. Much later, enzyme and tracer experiments delineated the role of CPO in the biosynthesis of caldariomycin (5Beckwith J.R. Clark R. Hager L.P. J. Biol.

CPO is undoubtedly the most versatile member of the heme peroxidase family. In addition to catalyzing chlorination, bromination, and iodination reactions (7Hager L.P. Morris D.R. Brown F.S.

CPO also catalyzes chiral benzylic (23Zaks A. Dodds D.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 10419-19424Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and propargylic hydroxylations (24Hu S. Hager L.P. Biochem.

The stereoselective abilities of CPO in chiral catalysis suggest that native CPO and/or engineered CPO mutants have the potential to become important industrial catalysts. chloroperoxidase isoelectric focusing δ-aminolevulinic acid The initial reaction of CPO with hydrogen peroxide generates an oxidized intermediate, Compound I. This oxidized intermediate contains one oxygen atom and both of the oxidizing equivalents originally present in hydrogen peroxide. One of the oxidizing equivalents is associated with the conversion of heme ferric iron to an oxyferryl iron species, and the other is generated by the removal of one of the electrons from the heme porphyrin, generating a porphyrin π cation radical (26Roberts J.E. Hoffman B.M. Rutter R.J. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2118-2121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rutter R.J. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 257: 7958-7961Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). It is assumed that the versatile functions of CPO must be based on a CPO unique active site structure that includes a proximal thiolate ligand to the heme iron and a glutamic acid residue distal to the heme (28Sundaramoorthy M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1367-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Glu-183 functions as a general acid-base catalyst in facilitating the formation of Compound I. In contrast, most if not all other peroxidases have histidines functioning in this role. In previous experiments, the proximal thiolate ligand (Cys-29) has been replaced with a histidine residue and the mutant enzyme was expressed in C. fumago (29Yi X. Mroczko K.M. Wang X. Hager L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; (12412–12417)PubMed Google Scholar). In this mutant, thekcat for chlorination and peroxidation was reduced ∼95%. The catalase and epoxidation activity in the mutant were reduced ∼70%. It is obvious that cysteine 29 plays an important role in CPO catalysis. However, unlike the comparable cytochrome P450 Cys to His mutant, the replacement of CPO cysteine 29 with histidine does not totally abolish CPO activities. The distal Glu-183 also plays an important role in the catalytic reactions of CPO. Attempts to express a Glu-183 to His mutant in C. fumago were unsuccessful probably because the mutation is a lethal event. Previous attempts to produce CPO knock-outs in C. fumago also systematically failed. Because it is highly unlikely that CPO, a secreted enzyme, is an essential gene product in C. fumago, there must be an alternate explanation for these failures. The opposite strand DNA to the DNA coding for CPO contains an open reading frame; thus, it is quite possible that CPO mutations could prove to be lethal by producing a mutation in the opposite strand DNA. Recently, Conesaet al. (30Conesa A. van de Velde F. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17635-17640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) have shown that the wild typeCPO gene can be expressed in Aspergillus nigerwith the recombinant protein retaining the catalytic properties of the native C. fumago enzyme. Therefore, this expression system was chosen for the production of the Glu-183 to His mutant. This paper describes the preparation, expression, properties, and catalytic activities of this CPO mutant. Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Invitrogen. T4 DNA ligase was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). Purified oligonucleotides were purchased from Keck Biotechnique Center at University of Illinois. Unless otherwise noted, chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used without further purification. Mutations were carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit of Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The mutations were introduced via PCR amplification of pTZC using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. The primers contained a silent mutation site that could be used in a convenient mutant-screening assay. Primers for site-directed mutagenesis were designed with the aid of the Wisconsin GCG Package, version 9.1 (Madison, WI). PCR reactions were carried out in a PerkinElmer thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Standard “hot-start” PCR was performed using high fidelity pfupolymerase. The PCR products were extracted and purified from agarose gels using kits purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The desired mutations were identified by restriction analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression vector pgpd/CPOE183H was constructed via a three-way ligation. The three DNA sequences used in the construction were: 1) a 230-bp AflIII/XmnI fragment derived from pCPO3 (30Conesa A. van de Velde F. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17635-17640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) that contained the N-terminal CPO coding sequence, 2) a ∼900-bpXmnI/BamHI fragment derived from pTZC (31Mead D.A. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. Protein Eng. 1986; 1: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) that contained the remaining CPO coding sequence, and 3) an A. niger expression vector, pAN52–5Not (GenBankTMaccession number Z32750), that contained an A. nidulans gpdpromoter and the A. niger trpC terminator sequences (32Conesa A. van den Hondel C.A. Punt P.J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2000; 66: 3016-3023Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The XmnI/BamHI fragment contained the E183H mutation. The A. niger vector was digested withNcoI and BamHI to create an insertion site for the CPO sequences (Fig. 1). Plasmid gpd/CPOE183H was co-transformed with pAB4-1 in A. niger MGG029 according to previously described procedures (33Conesa A. Weelink G. van den Hondel C.A. Punt P.J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Transformants were screened in situ by immunodetection as described previously (34Zong, Q., Expression of Recombinant Chloroperoxidase.Ph.D. thesis, 1997, University of Illinois.Google Scholar). The mutant clones were grown in roller bottles at 22 °C for 5–7 days. Each bottle contained 300 ml of 5% maltose, 5% yeast extract, 0.5% casein amino acids, 50 μm hemin (Sigma), and 100 μm δ-aminolevulinic acid (Sigma) and the Hutner metal ion supplement (35Hutner S.H. Provosoli L. Schatz A. Haskins C.P. Proc. Am. Phil. Soc. 1950; 94: 152-153Google Scholar). To stabilize the mutant chlorination and epoxidations activities, all of the purification buffer solutions contained 50 μm hemin. Crude culture medium containing the secreted enzyme (1.5 liters) was concentrated 50-fold and applied to a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B ion-exchange chromatography column (4 × 30 cm) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Bis/Tris at pH 6.5. The flow rate was adjusted 1 ml/min. Chromatography was carried out at 4 °C. The protein was eluted from the column with a step gradient of 50 mmBis/Tris buffer at pH 6.5 containing 10–70 mm ammonium sulfate. Each fraction was assayed for chlorination activity to identify the active fractions. The active fractions appeared in the eluent fractions containing 28 mm ammonium sulfate. The enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon, Newburyport, MA). The purity of the mutant enzyme was examined by 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel (Invitrogen) under denaturing condition (36Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207530) Google Scholar). The enzymes were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. IEF electrophoresis was performed using the Pharmacia Phastsystem with IEF PhastGels (pH 3–9) and the Pharmacia IEF Mix 2.8–6.5 kit. IEF gels were visualized by silver staining. Heme proteins were quantitatively determined using the hemochromogen analysis developed by Deeb and Hager (37Deeb S.S. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 1024-1031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This information provided a basis for comparing the relative enzymatic activities of the mutant and native CPO. Because both apomutant and holomutant enzymes were secreted in the A. niger cultures, the total concentration of mutant enzyme was measured in a dot blot assay. Aliquots of the partially purified mutant enzyme or aliquots of the crude culture medium were loaded onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was incubated with anti-CPO rabbit polyclonal IgG antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After incubation, the membrane was washed and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G for 1 h. After this second incubation step, the membrane was washed and then reacted with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide for 10 min for color development. The total concentration of apomutant plus holomutant enzyme was estimated by comparing the dot blot results with the results obtained from serial dilutions of known concentrations of native CPO. Far-UV-CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. Two spectra were recorded from 250 to 200 nm at 0.1-nm intervals with a spectral bandwidth of 1 nm (the spectra were averaged). The concentration of partially purified samples for both the mutant and native CPO control was identical (50 μg/ml). The relation between activity and pH was examined from pH 2.5 to 7.0 using the potassium phosphate buffers. All UV-visible absorption measurements were determined in a Shimadzu UV-1201 spectrophotometer using 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes. The chlorination of monochlorodimedone to dichlorodimedone was used for measuring the chlorination activity of the mutant CPO (7Hager L.P. Morris D.R. Brown F.S. Eberwein H. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 1769-1777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 2.75, 20 mm KCl, 0.5 mm monochlorodimedone, 2 mm H2O2, and a suitable aliquot of the enzyme in a total volume of 3 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the decrease in absorbance at 278 nm was monitored at room temperature. One unit of chlorination activity was defined as the formation of 1 μmol of dichlorodimedone per second. The epoxidation ofp-nitrostyrene was used to measure epoxidation activity according to the procedure developed by Rai et al. (38Rai G.P. Sakai S. Florez A.M. Mogollon L. Hager L.P. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2001; 343: 638-645Crossref Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.2 mmp-nitrostyrene, and 2 mmH2O2 plus a suitable aliquot of the enzyme in a total volume of 3 ml. The activity was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 312 nm as a function of time. One unit of epoxidation activity was defined as the formation of 1 μmol ofp-nitrostyrene oxide per second. The oxidation of reduced methylene blue was used to measure catalase activity (38Rai G.P. Sakai S. Florez A.M. Mogollon L. Hager L.P. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2001; 343: 638-645Crossref Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, 0.2 mm dithionite reduced methylene blue, 2 mmH2O2, and a suitable aliquot of enzyme in a total volume of 3 ml. One unit of catalase activity was defined as the formation of 1 μmol of the oxidized form of methylene blue per second. A. niger produces the E183H mutant enzyme at levels comparable to the expression of wild type CPO in A. niger. However, a majority of the mutant CPO expressed in A. niger is in the form of apoenzyme having no heme incorporated. By comparing the relative levels of apomutant and holomutant enzymes estimated from a hemochromogen assay and a dot blot immunoassay, the ratio of apoenzyme to holoprotein was ∼1.5 to 1. A similar observation has been made in the expression of recombinant wild type CPO in A. niger (30Conesa A. van de Velde F. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17635-17640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Most disturbingly, the E183H presented serious problems in early attempts to purify and characterize the mutant enzyme. In early studies, the Glu-183 mutant lost most of its chlorination and epoxidation activity in simple dialysis and ultrafiltration steps. Acetone precipitation, a regular purification step used with native CPO, could not be used because the mutant lost almost all activity when exposed to acetone at −20 °C. Subsequently, it was discovered that the loss of the chlorination and epoxidation activity during dialysis and ultrafiltration could be prevented by the addition of iron protoporyphyrin IX to the mutant enzyme preparations. The presence of heme greatly stabilized the E183H extracts, and in addition, 90% of the mutant protein now appeared in the form of holoenzyme. In contrast, holoenzyme represented only one-third of the mutant enzyme population in untreated extracts. Conesa et al. (30Conesa A. van de Velde F. van Rantwijk F. Sheldon R.A. Punt P.J. van den Hondel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17635-17640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) found that secreted wild type CPO inA. niger was subject to partial degradation by secreted protease activity. In our initial problems concerning the instability of the E183H mutant enzyme, we considered protease degradation as a potential cause of the instability. This turned out not to be true. Ten different protease inhibitors either singly or in kit form were tested and were found to have no effect. The inhibitors tested were antipain-dihydrochloride, bestatin, chymotatin, E-64, leupeptin, pepstatin, phosphoramidon, pefablioc SC, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Other reagents such as bovine serum albumin, glycerol, and sorbitol had no effect on the stability of the E183H enzyme. In regular culture broth, the secretion level of the mutant protein (apoenzyme plus holoenzyme) was quite low (∼2 mg/liter). The addition of ALA to the culture medium increased the secretion level ∼4-fold. ALA synthase is thought to be a crucial enzyme to regulate heme synthesis. There are a few reports regarding an increase in heme protein production by ALA inducement. For example, Herbaud et al. (39Herbaud M.L. Aubert C. Durand M.C. Guerlesquin F. Thony-Meyer L. Dolla A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) found that the highest cytochrome c3 production was obtained whenEscherichia coli was grown in LB medium supplemented with δ-aminolevulinic acid under aerobic condition (39Herbaud M.L. Aubert C. Durand M.C. Guerlesquin F. Thony-Meyer L. Dolla A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1481: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that the regulative effects of ALA and hemin on ALA synthase were done through transcriptional regulation (40Ades I.Z. Stevens T.M. Drew P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 253: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In these studies on the production of mutant CPO by A. niger, the addition of δ-aminolevulinic acid significantly enhanced the production of the E183H mutant enzyme. The instability of the mutant enzyme precluded the normal initial acetone precipitation routinely used to purify native CPO. Even the presence of heme did not protect Glu-183 from denaturation by acetone. DEAE ion exchange chromatography was used exclusively for purification of the mutant enzyme. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” all purification buffers contained 50 μm of hemin to stabilize the mutant enzyme. The specific activity of the partially purified E183H increased by 145-fold, and the enzyme showed a major band in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2) and had a RZ value of 1.2 (Fig. 3).Figure 3Absorption spectrum of the partially purified E183H. The RZ value, ratio ofA400 to A280, is 1.2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To evaluate the effect of the distal substitution on the various activities of CPO, the activities of the E183H mutant were measured in three different assays. The chlorination activity of the mutant enzyme decreased to a level of ∼15% of the wild type activity, and the catalase activity decreased to 50% of the native CPO catalytic activity (Fig. 4). As outlined under “Experimental Procedures,” the epoxidation ofp-nitrostyrene was used to assay the epoxidation activity of the E183H mutant according to the procedure developed by Rai et al. (38Rai G.P. Sakai S. Florez A.M. Mogollon L. Hager L.P. Adv. Synth. Catal. 2001; 343: 638-645Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast to the results obtained for the chlorination and dismutation mutant activities, epoxidation activity unexpectedly increased 2.5-fold (Fig. 4). To further elucidate the role of Glu-183 as a general acid-base catalysis, the pH optimum of the E183H mutant was examined. The enzyme activity was measured at various pH values ranging from pH 2.5 to 7.0. The concentration of H2O2 used in these studies was optimized for each pH value. The mutant was most active at pH 3.0, whereas its native counterpart was at pH 2.75 (Fig. 5). The E183H mutant showed a slightly higher pI value based on their isoelectric focusing gel properties (Fig.6), but this was expected for the replacement of a negatively charged by a positively charged one.Figure 6pI of the E183H mutant. This figure illustrates IEF using a PhastGel (pH 3–9) for the E183H mutant and native CPO, which shows that the pI of the mutant is slightly higher than that of native CPO. Lane 1, markers; lane 2, mutant CPO; lane 3, native CPO.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CD spectrum was used to exclude the possibility that activities of mutant enzyme were decreased by large structure changes. The CD data showed that there were some small differences in intensity in the peptide bond region between the mutant and native CPO; however, the overall shapes of the two spectra were the same (Fig. 7). The CD spectra of the mutant proteins (80.5% α-helix, 6.2% β-turn, and 15.7% unordered) were very similar to that of wild type (79.6% α-helix, 0.6% β-sheet, 6.4% β-turn, and 16.2% unordered). The result indicated that the amino acid substitutions had no significant effect on the overall folding of the mutant enzyme. The discovery that hemin protects the mutant enzyme during purification and the observation that the apoform of the mutant can be converted to the holoenzyme in the presence of hemin were extremely important observations because hemin allowed the purification and characterization of this mutant enzyme. This discovery may also offer a new approach to the production of mutant CPOs. Wild type apoCPO can be produced in E. coli in large quantities; however, under the very best conditions, only small amounts of holoenzyme could be obtained by reconstitution procedures (41Zong Q. Osmulski P.A. Hager L.P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12420-12425Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the E183H apomutant readily reconstitutes to holoenzyme and because the E183H mutant is more active than wild type CPO in chiral epoxidation catalysis, it appears logical to assume that further mutation of E183H in E. coli is an obvious choice for examining the active site requirements for chiral catalysis. Histidine plays a key role as a general acid-base catalyst in the formation of Compound I in the plant peroxidases. Poulos and Kraut (42Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10322-10330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proposes that the distal histidine assists the peroxide anion to bind the heme iron by acting as a general base catalyst while accepting a proton from the neutral hydrogen peroxide when it binds to the iron and by acting as a general acid catalyst by donating a proton to the departing hydroxide anion (42Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10322-10330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several mutant peroxidases have revealed histidine as an important active site residue. In wild type CPO, a glutamic acid residue replaces the plant peroxidase histidine distal residue and is postulated to function as the acid-base catalyst, facilitating the formation of Compound I. By analogy to the experiments with horseradish peroxidase where replacement of the distal histidine leads to large losses in activity (43Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9798-9806Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), it would be expected that replacement of the distal glutamic acid in CPO also should be deleterious. This is certainly true in terms of the halogenation activity of CPO. The rate of enzymatic chlorination in the Glu-183 to His mutant falls by ∼85%. This indicates that the distal Glu residue in native CPO is important but not essential for the halogenation activity of the enzyme. The van der Waals volume of histidine (98.8 cm3 mol−1) is larger than that of histidine (85.9 cm3 mol−1), so some distortion of the mutant active site should be expected. The fact that the mutant heme prosthetic group is more loosely held supports the conclusion that there has been a change in the geometry of the active site. The x-ray structure of native CPO identifies a proton shuttle among Glu-183, His-105, and Asp-106 (44Sundaramoorthy M. Mauro J.M. Sullivan A.M. Terner J. Poulos T.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1995; 51: 842-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). When Glu-183 is replaced with a histidine residue, the normal orientation of this triad could be partially destroyed. Such a change could obviously impair the chlorination activity of the mutant. In studies with horseradish peroxidase mutants, it has been shown that the loss of a hydrogen bond between the distal His-42 and Asp-70 induces severe functional defects in peroxidase activity (45Tanaka M. Ishimori K. Mukai M. Kitagawa T. Morishima I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9889-9898Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, previous experiments have shown that the modification of a single histidine residue with diethyl pyrocarbonate totally inactivates CPO with respect to chlorination activity (46Blanke S.R. Hager L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12454-12461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A quite different picture emerges from a comparison of the catalytic activity of the mutant and native CPOs in the epoxidation reaction. In this case, the mutant is ∼2.5-fold more active than the native enzyme. In focusing on the origin of this increase in activity, it is highly unlikely that the increase in activity could be associated with the formation of Compound I, the first step in all CPO oxidations. The rate constant for the formation of Compound I in the reaction of native enzyme with hydrogen peroxide is 2.4 × 106m−1sec−1 (47Araiso T. Rutter R. Palcic M.M. Hager L.P. Dunford H.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1981; 59: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), whereas the rate constants for both the chlorination and epoxidation activity of native CPO are magnitudes lower. Thus, the overall rate for both chlorination and epoxidation reactions must reside in the second step involving the reaction between Compound I and the oxidizable substrate. It seems probable that the distortion of the active site that inhibits the chlorination activity must actually facilitate the reaction between the olefinic substrate and the oxygen atom in the oxyferryl Compound I species, perhaps by allowing a closer approach of the olefinic substrate to the oxygen atom of the oxyferryl group in Compound I. Clearly, the olefinic substrate must approach the Compound I intermediate from the distal side of the heme. In the mechanism-based suicide reaction between CPO Compound I andcis-β-methyl styrene, an oxygen-carbon bond is formed in the inactive intermediate (48Debrunner P.G. Dexter A.F. Xia Y.-M. Hager L.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12791-12798Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In a similar vein, the proton shuttle among Glu-183, His-105, and Asp-106 that is important for chlorination activity appears unimportant for epoxidation activity. The diethyl pyrocarbonate treatment that kills chlorination activity does not impair epoxidation activity. We thank Dr. Shaomin Tian for CD data processing."

Alternative splicing, RNA editing, and alternative translational initiation all allow for more than one protein isoform to be produced by individual genes. Alternative splicing is the most prevalent of the post-transcriptional mechanisms for producing protein isoforms. Conservative estimates predict that one- to two-thirds of human genes are alternatively spliced, and some of these genes have the potential to produce thousands of isoforms (reviewed in Refs. 3Black D.L.

Regulation of alternative splicing involves the interaction of cellulartrans-acting factors with specific cis-acting regulatory elements within a target pre-mRNA (8Smith C.W.J. Valcárcel J.

Such regulation can be positive, involving activator factors and enhancer sequences. Conversely, repressor proteins can mediate their influence via silencer elements. Although some model systems of regulated splicing involve the presence or absence of a single regulatory protein, the majority of examples appear to be more complex, with regulatory decisions being achieved by particular combinations of regulatory factors, each of which is expressed more widely than the splicing event that is being regulated (7Maniatis T.

PTB was originally identified as a potential splicing factor due to its ability to bind to polypyrimidine tracts at 3′-splice sites (14Garcia-Blanco M.A. Jamison S.F. Sharp P.A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 510-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Consistent with these varied roles, PTB can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, but is predominantly localized in the nucleus (37Perez I. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11881-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The optimal RNA binding sequence for PTB (UCUU in a pyrimidine-rich context) is found within silencer elements that act by binding PTB (26Perez I. Lin C.-H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). These elements are often found within the 3′-splice site polypyrimidine tract; and in some cases, PTB acts by directly competing for binding to the polypyrimidine tract with the splicing factor U2AF65 (23Lin C.-H. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1995; 1: 234-245PubMed Google Scholar, 27Singh R. Valcarcel J. Green M.R. Science. 1995; 268: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, PTB-binding sites are also found in other locations in the region of PTB-regulated exons, so it may also be able to inhibit splicing in other ways (reviewed in Ref. 13Wagner E.J. Garcia-Blanco M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3281-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Consistent with its expression pattern, most PTB-mediated repression of specific exons is widespread. Regulated selection of the exons occurs in a small subset of tissues where the repressive action of PTB is either absent or in some way modulated. PTB exists in two major alternatively spliced isoforms, termed PTB1 and PTB4, which arise from skipping or inclusion, respectively, of exon 9, which encodes a 26-amino acid insert. A minor isoform, PTB2, is produced by inclusion of exon 9 using an internal 3′-splice site, giving a 19-amino acid insert. In at least one case, these isoforms have differential activity, with PTB4 being more repressive upon α-tropomyosin exon 3 than PTB2 or PTB1 (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition to the PTB isoforms, at least two paralog genes, nPTB/brPTB and ROD1, with ∼70% amino acid identity to PTB have been identified. nPTB/brPTB (38Polydorides A.D. Okano H.J. Yang Y.Y.L. Stefani G. Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6350-6355Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 39Markovtsov V. Nikolic J.M. Goldman J.A. Turck C.W. Chou M.-Y. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) is expressed predominantly in neuronal cells, whereas ROD1 is expressed mainly in hematopoietic cells (40Yamamoto H. Tsukahara K. Kanaoka Y. Jinno S. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3829-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Cells expressing nPTB or ROD1 tend to express less PTB; and in the case of the alternative N1 exon of c-src, nPTB is less repressive than PTB, contributing to the neuronal selection of the N1 exon (39Markovtsov V. Nikolic J.M. Goldman J.A. Turck C.W. Chou M.-Y. Black D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The effect of nPTB on other splicing events is similar to that of PTB (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although no functional data have been reported on ROD1, a reasonable proposal is that, in neuronal or hematopoietic cells expressing nPTB or ROD1, many PTB-repressed splicing events will be unaffected, whereas a specific subset will be altered. Alterations in the expression of the alternatively spliced isoforms of PTB or in the expression of paralog genes therefore provide one way in which PTB activity can be modulated. We have been investigating two alternative splicing events that are regulated in smooth muscle (SM) cells. In α-actinin, a SM-specific exon is repressed by PTB in non-SM cells, leading to inclusion of the mutually exclusive alternative non-muscle (NM) exon (see Fig.1A) (28Southby J. Gooding C. Smith C.W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2699-2711Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Waites G.T. Graham I.R. Jackson P. Millake D.B. Patel B. Blanchard A.D. Weller P.A. Eperon I.C. Critchley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6263-6271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In α-tropomyosin (α-TM), exon 2 is included only as a result of repression of the mutually exclusive exon 3 in SM cells (see Fig. 1C) (42Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This repression is mediated in part by high affinity PTB-binding sites on either side of exon 3 (21Gooding C.G. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 26Perez I. Lin C.-H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro splicing experiments have shown that PTB mediates a low level of exon 3 repression in non-muscle extracts (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, in vivo, full repression is observed only in SM cells. In this respect, PTB-mediated repression of α-TM exon 3 differs from all other characterized splicing events regulated by PTB. In an attempt to understand how the tropomyosin and actinin splicing events are regulated, we investigated the expression of PTB isoforms in dedifferentiating rat aorta smooth muscle (RASM) cells. We found no change in the ratio of PTB1 and PTB4. However, in a number of SM tissues, we detected expression of a novel PTB paralog that is distinct from PTB, nPTB/brPTB, and ROD1. We refer to the new paralog as smPTB due to its initial identification and high levels of expression in SM tissues. smPTB is ∼70% identical to PTB and has additional 36- and 22-amino acid inserts in two of the linker regions separating RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains. Recombinant smPTB binds RNA in vitro and has splicing inhibitory activity. We propose that expression of smPTB may play a role in switching subsets of alternative splicing events in SM and other cells. Primary RASM cells were isolated by enzymatic dispersion and cultured as described (43Kemp P.R. Grainger D.J. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,44Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Total RNA from SM cells and tissues was made using TRI reagent (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Splicing patterns of the different genes were analyzed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Oligo(dT) was used for reverse transcription by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (45Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). PCR was carried out with a 32P-end-labeled primer using a hot start of 92 °C for 3 min, followed by enzyme addition at 80 °C. Thirty cycles were carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing temperature (variable) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, with a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min. A 55 °C annealing temperature was used for primer sets 5′-vin/3′-vin, TM1/TM4, P30/31 (smPTB + PTB) (see Fig. 4), P37/Pd3′2 (smPTB + PTB) (see Fig.2), P37/P38 (PTB-specific), and P12/P38 (human PTB plasmid markers). A 58 °C annealing temperature was used for primer set P32/P33 (smPTB-specific). A 60 °C annealing temperature was used for primer set EF1a5′/3′-act. In each case, the 5′-primer is stated first. For the PTB plasmid marker PCR, 10% Me2SO was included. Products were analyzed on 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used for PCR are as follows: EF1a5′, 5′-ATCAGCCAGGAACAGATG-3′; 3′-act, 5′-ACATGAAGTCGATGAAGGCCTG-3′; 5′-vin, 5′-GGTGATTAACCAGCCAATGATGAT-3′; 3′-vin, 5′-CTTCACAGACTGCATGAGGTT-3′; TM1, 5′-CGAGCAGAGCAGGCGGAG-3′; TM4, 5′-CAGAGATGCTACGTCAGCTTCAGC-3′; P12, 5′-AAGAGCCGTGACTACACACGC-3′; P30, 5′-GACCTGCCCTC(A/T)G(A/G)(T/A)GACAG-3′; P31, 5′-GCGTTCTCCTTC(C/T)TGTTGAACA-3′; P33, 5′-TCGGTGCACATCGCCATAGGCA-3′; P37, 5′-AAGAGCCGAGACTACACACGC-3′; P38, 5′-GAGGCTTTGGGGTGTGACTCT-3′; and Pd3′2, 5′-TTGCCGTCCGCCATCTGCACTA-3′.Figure 2Novel PTB in differentiated SM cells.A, alternative splicing of PTB exons 9 and 11.

Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). Full-length smPTB and PTB were cloned into vectors forin vivo transfection (pCMVSPORT), localization (pEGFPN1 or pEGFPC1), and overexpression in Escherichia coli (pET21). Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was used to amplify smPTB in two halves using gene-specific primers from day 0 rat aorta RNA. 3′-RACE (45Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar) was carried out as a first round with oligo(dT) and P32 (see below) as the forward gene-specific primer (30 cycles of 94 °C of 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s). This was followed by nested PCR with a forward gene-specific primer (P10) under the same cycle conditions. For 5′-cDNA, SMART RACE (Clontech) was used. Reverse transcription was carried out using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase with oligo(dT) plus a SMART oligonucleotide (P77). The first round of PCR was carried out (30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 60 s) with a 5′-primer mixture at a ratio of 5:1 P79/P78 plus the gene-specific 3′-reverse primer P33 (see above). Advantage GC2 polymerase (Clontech) was used. This was followed by 25 cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 2 min) of nested PCR with a 5′-primer (P80) and a gene-specific primer (P11 or P41). The oligonucleotides used for RACE were as follows: P10, 5′-TTCCTCAAGCTGCAGGCTTGGCCA-3′; P11, 5′-GGGAGCCTGAGGTGACCATTGAGC-3′; P32, 5′-ATGACAGTCAGCCCTCTCCGGTC-3′; P41, 5′-GAGCTGAGGCCATGTTCTGGACCTGGACCGGA-3′; P77, 5′-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACGCGGG-3′; and P80, 5′-AAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGT. The sequence of the complete rat smPTB open reading frame has been deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank (accession number AY223520). 35S-Labeled sense and antisense RNA probes corresponding to mouse smPTB amino acids 100–182 were transcribed in vitro and hybridized to day 10, 14, and 15 mouse embryo sections as described (46Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1912-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). PAC-1 or HeLa cells grown on coverslips were transiently transfected, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), with PTB or smPTB tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at the C or N terminus. After 24 or 48 h, the coverslips were inverted on a microscope slide, and GFP was visualized using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope with an MC100 camera attached for photographs. C-terminally His6-tagged recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as previously described (46Ellis P.D. Chen Q. Barker P.J. Metcalfe J.C. Kemp P.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1912-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with one modification for smPTB. To solubilize smPTB, it was necessary to re-extract the pellet after lysis using the non-detergent sulfobetaine (1 m; NDSB-201) in lysis buffer (47Goldberg M.E. Expert-Bezancon N. Vuillard L. Rabilloud T. Folding Des. 1995; 1: 21-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). High specific activity [α-32P]UTP-labeled RNA probes (20 fmol) were incubated with recombinant protein in 12 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 3% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, and 50 μg/ml E. colirRNA for 20 min at 30 °C. For competitive binding experiments, PTB4 and smPTB were premixed before addition of the RNA. Heparin was added to 0.25 mg/ml, and the reaction was left for 5 min at room temperature. Samples were irradiated on ice at 254 nm in a Spectrolinker cross-linker with a controlled energy dose of 1.92 mJ. RNA was digested with RNases T1 (1 unit/μl) and A (0.4 mg/ml), and the samples were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. PAC-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Transient transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE; total RNA was isolated using TRI reagent; and RT-PCR for α-actinin was carried out as previously described (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In view of the evidence for the involvement of PTB in controlling alternative splicing of α-TM and α-actinin and of the differential activity of the alternatively spliced PTB isoforms upon α-TM splicing (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze expression of PTB in a well characterized model cell system in which these events are regulated. Freshly isolated RASM cells are initially highly differentiated, but, over the course of 4–6 days in culture, become dedifferentiated and cease to express a number of genes associated with the differentiated contractile state (43Kemp P.R. Grainger D.J. Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We analyzed alternative splicing of α-TM, α-actinin, and vinculin/meta-vinculin in RNA from RASM cells at day 0 or 4 in culture and from the PAC-1 pulmonary artery SM cell line (Fig.1). RT-PCR analysis of α-actinin splicing indicated that, at day 0, the major product included the SM exon, with a small amount containing the larger NM exon (Fig.1A). A small quantity of product corresponding to skipping of both the NM and SM exons was also observed. Like the SM isoform, this “double-skipped” product, which has not been reported before, would result in a nonfunctional EF-hand domain. By day 4, there were roughly equal amounts of the SM and NM isoforms, with a decrease in the amount of the skipped product. The cultured PAC-1 cells were similar to the day 4 cells, but with more NM than SM inclusion and no double-skipped product. RT-PCR analysis of vinculin (Fig.1B) showed that the meta-vinculin isoform was expressed as a minor isoform only in day 0 RASM cells and was undetectable in day 4 and PAC-1 cells. Mutually exclusive splicing of α-TM exons 2 and 3 produced products of identical size. To differentiate them, the radiolabeled PCR products were digested withXhoI, which cuts within exon 2 to produce a 145-nucleotide product, or with PvuII, which cuts exon 3 products to produce a 150-nucleotide band (Fig. 1C). Double digests showed that the PCR product could be fully digested by both enzymes. The almost complete XhoI digestion and PvuII resistance of the day 0 PCR product showed that fully differentiated RASM cells predominantly expressed the exon 2-containing α-TM isoform. By day 4, PvuII digested a greater proportion of the PCR product compared with XhoI, indicating a substantial switch toward inclusion of exon 3 instead of exon 2. In comparison, in cultured PAC-1 cells, the majority of α-TM RNA contained exon 3. PAC-1 cells commonly show a greater degree of regulated splicing than observed here (21Gooding C.G. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 42Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 48Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Mak H.Y. Proudfoot N.J. Smith C.W.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but they served as a useful undifferentiated control sample. Taken together, the data indicate that the three alternative splicing events analyzed in RASM cells showed a substantial switch toward the non-SM pattern after 4 days in culture. Having observed the switch in alternative splicing of α-TM and α-actinin, both of which are regulated by PTB, we next analyzed expression of the PTB isoforms. RT-PCR was carried out using primers P37 and P38, which correspond to exons 8 and 11, respectively. This analysis allows the detection of alternative splicing of exon 9, which gives rise to the PTB1 and PTB4 isoforms. Unlike α-TM, α-actinin, and vinculin, alternative splicing of the PTB1 and PTB4 isoforms showed no significant changes between the day 0 and 4 RASM and PAC-1 samples (Fig.2B). Therefore, despite the fact that PTB4 has been shown to be a more active repressor of α-TM exon 3 compared with PTB1 (29Wollerton M. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E. Jackson R. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), changes in the ratio of the PTB isoforms do not cause the switch in α-TM and α-actinin splicing in dedifferentiating RASM cells. RT-PCR was not carried out under conditions that would allow quantitative analysis of absolute levels of expression. Nevertheless, we consistently observed that the levels of PTB products appeared to be lower in day 0 cells than in day 4 cells. Further analysis of PTB expression using primers P37 and Pd3′2, which prime within exons 8 and 12, respectively, produced a strikingly different result. A novel band (labeled smPTB in Fig.2, C and D) larger than PTB4 was the major PCR product in day 0 samples, but not in day 4 or PAC-1 samples. Cloning and sequencing of this PCR product showed that it was derived from a PTB-related gene that was distinct from PTB and the known paralogsROD1 (40Yamamoto H. Tsukahara K. Kanaoka Y. Jinno S. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3829-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and nPTB (38Polydorides A.D. Okano H.J. Yang Y.Y.L. Stefani G. Darnell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 7463-7479Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We refer to this new PTB paralog as smPTB due to its high expression in a number of SM tissues (see below). RT-PCR using smPTB-specific primers P32 and P33 confirmed that it was expressed in day 0 RASM cells, but not in day 4 or cultured PAC-1 cells (Fig. 2D). smPTB was also expressed in other SM tissues such as the uterus and vas deferens. At the time that we identified smPTB, no corresponding sequences could be identified by BLAST searches of available expressed sequence tag or genomic data bases. However, using 3′- and 5′-RACE, full-length smPTB cDNA was isolated from day 0 RASM cell RNA. The open reading frame encodes a 588-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 63.7 kDa and with 53–74% amino acid identity to PTB, nPTB, and ROD1 (Fig.3). Pairwise BLAST analyses showed that smPTB is more closely related to PTB than to either of the other genes. Subsequent to cloning the full-length smPTB cDNA, the corresponding rat gene sequence was identified using the ENSEMBL Trace Database, whereas the mouse gene was identified by BLAST analysis of annotated mouse genomic data bases and was located in contig 132920, corresponding to chromosome X A1.1. Both the rat and mouse genes are intronless. The mouse gene contains three possible polyadenylation addition signals giving a message size of 4.16, 5.09, or 6.53 kb. As determined by Northern blot analysis, the size of the rat smPTB mRNA is close to 6 kb (data not shown). smPTB has the same overall structural organization as PTB (Fig. 3), with four RRM domains and the same unu"

At least two mRNA instability elements reside within the PAI-2 transcript; one in the coding region and another within the 3′-untranslated region (UTR). For the latter, a functional AU-rich motif (ARE) has been identified that provides a binding site for a number of cellular proteins, including the mRNA stability protein, HuR. In this study, we used the yeast three-hybrid system to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library to identify other proteins that associate with the PAI-2 ARE. This screen identified tristetraprolin (TTP) as a PAI-2 mRNA ARE-binding protein. UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that TTP expressed in HEK293 cells could associate with the PAI-2 ARE in vitro. Co-transfection of plasmids expressing TTP and PAI-2 in HEK293 cells resulted in an increase in the decay rate of PAI-2 mRNA and loss of PAI-2 protein in a process that was dependent upon the PAI-2 3′-UTR. The 29-nt PAI-2 AU-rich element alone was also capable of conferring TTP-dependent mRNA instability to a reporter transcript. The extent of PAI-2 mRNA stability was remarkably sensitive to TTP since TTP-dependent PAI-2 mRNA decay occurred at TTP levels that were below Western blot detection limits.

PAI-2 is also a member of the OV-serpin family of serine protease inhibitors and has been considered as the most enigmatic member of this group of proteins (2Bachmann F. Thromb.

One of the most striking features of PAI-2 is that it exists in two molecular forms: a predominant non-glycosylated protein and a less abundant secreted glycosylated protein. The predominant intracellular location of PAI-2 has suggested additional functions for this u-PA inhibitor, and growing evidence has indicated an involvement for PAI-2 in the intracellular events associated with differentiation (3Jensen P.J.

Biochem. 1998; 256: 550-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) to the regulation of PAI-2 expression, significant regulation also occurs at the post-transcriptional level, most notably at the level of PAI-2 mRNA stability (16Maurer F.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression has proven to be a particularly important component in the global control of gene regulation. It is now well established that the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of mRNA is critical in the decision-making process of transcript longevity (18Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Most studies have focused on conserved AU-rich elements within the 3′-UTR of unstable cytokine or proto-oncogene transcripts. Typical elements are mostly of the AUUUA or UUAUUUAUU type or variants thereof (19Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar, 20Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and are mRNA destabilizing motifs that act, in part, by their ability to attract specialized RNA-binding proteins to elicit the decay process. These same elements have also been linked to other aspects of mRNA metabolism and processing including RNA trafficking (21Snee M. Kidd G.J. Munro T.P. Smith R. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4661-4669Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and translation (22Zhang T. Kruys V. Huez G. Gueydan C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 30: 952-958Crossref Google Scholar), indicating that a given AU-rich element has pleiotropic effects. A number of AU-rich element-binding proteins have been identified and shown to interact with these elements in many of these unstable transcripts including AUF-1 (23Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. DeMaria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652-7665Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), AUH (24Nakagawa J. Waldner H. Meyer-Monard S. Hofsteenge J. Jeno P. Moroni C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2051-2055Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the ELAV protein family members (25Good P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), and tristetraprolin (TTP) (26Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AUF-1 for example, engages AU-rich elements in a variety of these genes, and the affinity of interaction correlates with the ability of these sequences to serve as mRNA instability elements (27DeMaria C.T. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12179-12184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Members of the ELAV family including HuD, HuC, and HuR (HuA) can also interact with these same elements, but at least for HuR, this interaction is associated more with stabilization rather than destabilization of mRNA (28Levy N.S. Chung S. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6417-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 29Fan X.C. Steitz J.A.

Arguably the most powerful mRNA destabilizing protein identified is TTP. This protein is a critical regulator of TNF-α and GM-CSF mRNA instability (26Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Lai W.I Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar, 32Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Blood. 2000; 95: 1891-1899Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This has been decisively born out in TTP −/− mice, which develop a severe inflammatory phenotype because of the increase in cytokine expression resulting from the loss of negative regulation at the post-transcriptional level (26Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TTP is therefore clearly a mRNA destabilizing protein that acts at least in part by promoting deadenylation and by attracting the exosome to the transcript for rapid decay (33Chen C-Y. Gherzi R. Ong S.E. Chan E.L. Raijmakers R. Prujin Ger J.M. Stoecklin G. Moroni C. Mann M. Karin M. Cell. 2001; 107: 451-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). Previous studies have addressed the mechanisms underlying the post-transcriptional regulation of the PAI-2 gene. Two functional mRNA instability elements have been identified within the PAI-2 transcript, one within the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA (16Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and the other within exon 4 of the coding region (34Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13675-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Closer analysis of the 3′-UTR region of PAI-2 mRNA led to the identification of a nonameric AU-rich element (UUAUUUAUU) (ARE), 304-nt upstream from the poly(A) tail, as a mRNA destabilizing determinant (16Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This element was subsequently shown to provide a binding site for a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins (17Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), one of which was HuR, although the role of HuR in the post-transcriptional control of PAI-2 remains to be determined. To identify and characterize additional proteins that assemble on the PAI-2 ARE, a human leukocyte cDNA library was screened for PAI-2 AU-rich element-binding proteins using the yeast three-hybrid approach. This screen identified tristetraprolin (TTP) as a specific PAI-2 ARE-binding protein that associates with the PAI-2 AU-rich element and participates in the PAI-2 mRNA decay process. Since TTP is widely considered as a post-transcriptional regulator of cytokine gene expression in response to inflammatory signals our study suggests that the biological targets of TTP are not restricted to cytokines and implicates PAI-2 in a broader context of the inflammatory response associated with TTP. The reporter yeast strain L40-coat and the RNA bait plasmid vectors pIIIA/MS2-1 and pIIIA/MS2-2 (containing selection marker URA3, ADE2) (35SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar,36Zhang B. Gallegos M. Puoti A. Durkin E. Fields S. Kimble J. Wickens M.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) were generous gifts from Dr. Marv Wickens of the University of Wisconsin. The TTP mammalian expression plasmid CMV.hTTPtag (31Lai W.I Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar) (hereafter referred to as pTTP-HA) was provided by Dr. Paul Bohjanen (University of Minnesota). The wild-type PAI-2 expression plasmid pCI-PAI-2 contains the 1872-bp PAI-2 cDNA (9Schleuning W-D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbühler R. Kruithof E.K.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4564-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) inserted into theEcoR1 site of the expression plasmid pCl-neo (Promega, Madison, WI) (34Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13675-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The RNA bait plasmids were constructed as follows. The 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides of the ARE region (29 bp) of the human PAI-2 gene, were synthesized by Sigma Genosys: 5′-TTTTACTTTGTTATTTATTATTTTATATA-3′ and 5′-TATATAAAATAATAAATAACAAAGTAAAA-3′. After annealing, the double-stranded ARE oligonucleotide was inserted into theSmaI site of the pIIIA/MS2-2 and pIIIA/MS2-1, creating ARE/MS2-2 and ARE/MS2-1, respectively (36Zhang B. Gallegos M. Puoti A. Durkin E. Fields S. Kimble J. Wickens M.P. Nature. 1997; 390: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The insertion and orientation of the ARE in the plasmids was confirmed by PCR and sequence analysis (sequencing primer: 5′-CTGTCTCTATACTCCCCTATAG-3′). Plasmid pCMV-glo (hereafter referred to as pCI-glo), contains the rabbit β-globin gene driven by the CMV promoter (37Nanbu R. Menoud P-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pCI-glo-PAI-2 is the same as pCI-glo, but contains the entire 3′-UTR of the PAI-2 mRNA inserted into the 3′-UTR of the globin reporter gene (16Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCI-glo-ARE and pCI glo-2ARE are the same as pCI-glo, but contain either a single copy or two copies of the 29-nt PAI-2 ARE inserted into the 3′-UTR of the globin reporter gene, respectively. To prepare these plasmids, complementary oligonucleotides containing the single (29 nt) or tandem (58 nt) copy of the PAI-2 AU-rich element were synthesized. These oligonucleotides also included restriction sites for XhoI at each end to enable subcloning into the XhoI site of pCI-glo. Oligonucleotides were annealed, digested with XhoI, and inserted into theXhoI site of pCI-glo using standard techniques. The yeast three-hybrid screening procedures were performed essentially as described elsewhere (35SenGupta D.J. Zhang B. Kraemer B. Pochart P. Fields S. Wickens M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8496-8501Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 38Park Y.W. Tan S.L. Katze M.G. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 39Bernstein D.S. Buter N. Stumpf C. Wickens M. Methods. 2002; 26: 123-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The plasmids pIIIA/ARE-MS2-2 and pIIIA/ARE-MS2-1 were introduced into yeast L40-coat by transformation. A human leukocyte cell cDNA library (250 μg; Clontech) was transformed into L40/pIIIA/ARE-MS2-2 and L40/pIIIA/ARE-MS2-1. Double transformants (Trp+, Leu+, Ura+) were then plated onto Trp−, Leu−, His−, Ura− plates containing 5 mm 3-aminotriazole (3-AT). As a negative selection procedure, candidate yeast clones were transferred onto plates containing 0.1% 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA) to eliminate the majority of RNA-independent false positive colonies (38Park Y.W. Tan S.L. Katze M.G. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 1102-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The same yeast clones were also transferred onto Trp−, Leu−, His− Ura− plates containing 5 mm 3-AT (“master plates”). The 5-FOA-sensitive colonies identified on the master plates were subsequently patched onto non-selective plates (Trp−, Leu−) to select for colonies in which the RNA plasmid had been removed (“RNA-dropout colonies”): After 3–4 days growth, single yeast colonies that had the RNA plasmid dropped out (pink color) were spotted back onto Leu− Trp− plates containing 0.1% 5-FOA to confirm that the RNA plasmid had been removed and were able to grow. In parallel, yeast were also transferred to Leu−, His− plates containing 5 mm 3-AT to retest for the RNA-dependent activation of HIS3. In order to test candidate colonies for RNA sequence-specific activation of HIS3, the RNA dropout colonies expressing the putative RNA-binding protein cDNA, were retransformed with four different RNA plasmids: ARE/MS2−2, ARE/MS2−1, PAI-2 exon 4/MS2−2 as an unrelated RNA bait, and RNA bait vector pIIIA/MS2-2. After transformation, the single yeast colonies were picked and spotted onto Ura−, Trp−, Leu− plates to confirm the success of transformation and also onto Trp−, Ura−, Leu−, His− plates containing 5 mm3-AT to test for RNA sequence-specific activation of HIS3. Positive colonies should grow only with RNA bait plasmids containing the PAI-2 ARE sequence, but not with baits containing irrelevant RNA sequence or empty RNA bait vector alone. cDNA plasmids from positive clones were isolated and subjected to DNA sequencing analysis (GAL4 AD sequencing primer: 5′-TACCACTACAATGGAT-3′). The cDNA sequences were then BLAST-searched for gene homology with the GenBankTM databases at NCBI. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1× penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C under 5% CO2. HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with the PAI-2 expression plasmid pCI-PAI-2 (17Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and the TTP expression plasmid pTTP-HA, or globin/PAI-2 3′-UTR and TTP expression plasmids, by the calcium phosphate method (40Costa M. Shen Y. Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), except that the transfection mixture was allowed to incubate with the cells for 16–24 h, and the glycerol shock was omitted (31Lai W.I Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Fresh DMEM medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was then added and cells maintained for a further 24 h. Total RNA was extracted for Northern blotting as described below. Bluescript plasmids harboring the 29-nt PAI-2 AU-rich element (17Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) were used to transcribe the PAI-2 ARE RNA probes in vitro. Following linearization withXbaI, 1 μg of template was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the presence of 50 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 10 μm UTP, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm CTP, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Promega) and 50 units of T7 RNA polymerase. RNA probes were purified on a 6% polyacrylamide-urea denaturing gel, eluted in a 500 mm NH4CH3COO, 1 mm EDTA solution for 6 h at room temperature, ethanol precipitated at −80 °C, and resuspended in water (500–1000 cps/μl) as previously described (16Maurer F. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26074-26080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To prepare protein extracts for the UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation, confluent cells were collected by trypsinization, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, then lysed for 5 min on ice in 100 μl/106 cells of cytoplasmic extraction buffer (CEB; 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.1, 3 mmMgCl2, 14 mm KCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm NaF). The nuclei were pelleted for 1 min at 1000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was aliquoted, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared from isolated nuclei as previously described (41Costa M. Medcalf R.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of cell extracts was determined by the Bio-Rad protein dye reagent. For the binding assays, 4 μg of protein extract were preincubated with 150 μg of heparin and 40 units of RNase inhibitor (RNasin;Promega) for 10 min at room temperature in CEB buffer before addition of the RNA probe (200 cps) in a total volume of 20 μl. After a further 30 min incubation at room temperature, samples were transferred to a 96-well microplate, which was placed on ice and irradiated for 15 min at a distance of 5 cm from a UV source (Ultra LUM model UVB-20). RNA not associated with protein was digested with 100 units of RNase T1 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at room temperature. In some experiments the RNase T1-resistant RNA-protein complexes were further digested with 1 μg of RNase A (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 15 min. The samples were diluted to 0.4 ml in CEB buffer, and protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) added (total volume of 0.45 ml). These were incubated overnight at 4 °C in the presence of either preimmune rabbit serum (1:150 dilution) or crude polyclonal rabbit anti-HA (HA.11) antiserum (1:150 dilution) (BabCO, Richmond, CA). Immune complexes were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with CEB buffer, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels and autoradiography. Total RNA was purified from transfected cells as described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (42Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 20-μg aliquots of RNA were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gels containing 20% formaldehyde and subsequently transferred to Hybond-N+ membranes (Amersham Biosciences). The filters were hybridized with32P-labeled DNA probes as described (17Maurer F. Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1664-1673Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Membranes were processed by standard techniques and exposed to Kodak BioMax film (Eastman Kodak) at −80 °C with two intensifying screens. The labeled cDNA probes used for hybridization were obtained as follows: 752 bp of the exon 1–6 PCR-amplified fragment of PAI-2 cDNA (9Schleuning W-D. Medcalf R.L. Hession C. Rothenbühler R. Kruithof E.K.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4564-4567Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar); the 1.1-kb HindIII TTP cDNA fragment of pTTP-HA (CMV.hTTPtag (31Lai W.I Carballo E. Strum J.R. Kennington E.A. Phillips R.S. Blackshear P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4311-4323Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar)); and the 380-bpHindIII/BamHI fragment of pCMV-glo containing the globin cDNA fragment (37Nanbu R. Menoud P-A. Nagamine Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4920-4928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed as previously described (34Tierney M. Medcalf R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13675-13684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts (up to 50 μg) prepared from cells were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred to nylon membranes. Membranes were hybridized with antibodies directed against TTP (1:1000 dilution; kind gift from Dr. Andrew Clark) or PAI-2 (1:10,000 dilution; American Diagnostica). Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase were added (1:2,000 dilution) and the immunocomplexes assessed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The yeast three-hybrid approach was used to screen a human leukocyte cDNA library for proteins that interacted with the functional 29-nt AU-rich element within the 3′-UTR of PAI-2 mRNA. This genetic approach yielded seven positive clones that interacted with the PAI-2 AU-rich RNA bait in both an RNA-dependent and RNA sequence-dependent manner. Sequence analysis revealed that three of seven clones were identical, and all clones contained partial cDNA sequences (1399–1436 bp) that were homologous to human TTP (Fig. 1). The 5′-end point of the clones ended between −310 and −354 of the TTP cDNA. All clones had the identical 3′ structure, with the exception of one clone (clone 5) that contained a 43-bp deletion at the terminus of the 3′-UTR (Fig. 1). TTP contains 326 amino acids with three tetraprolin repeats and two zinc fingers of the 2 Cys-Cys-Cys-His class. All clones contained the two zinc finger domains and two of the three tetraprolin domains suggesting the functional importance of these domains for PAI-2 AU-rich RNA binding activity. To confirm that TTP could directly interact with the PAI-2 ARE, RNA probes containing a single copy of the PAI-2 AU-rich element were incubated with cytoplasmic extracts prepared from either mock-transfected HEK293 cells, or cells transiently transfected with 5 μg of plasmid pTTP-HA. Samples were UV cross-linked then immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies or preimmune serum, and subjected to SDS-PAGE (Fig.2, lanes 1–4). Replicate samples were digested with RNase T1 either alone (lanes 5–8) or in combination with RNase A (lanes 9–12) prior to immunoprecipitation. As shown, extracts prepared from cells transfected with 5.0 μg of pTTP-HA did not produce an immunoprecipitable complex in the presence of preimmune serum (lane 2). However, protein-RNA complexes were detected when samples were immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibodies (lane 4). Following RNase T1 digestion, two complexes of ∼120 and 55 kDa still remained (lane 8). When samples were digested with both RNase T1 and RNase A only a single complex of molecular mass 52 kDa was present (lane 12), although the 120-kDa complex was still present after longer exposure of gel to x-ray film. The 120-kDa complex most likely represents TTP associating with another protein and is more sensitive to RNase A possibly due to conformational changes. The slight reduction in molecular mass of the HA-containing RNA complex from 55 to 52 kDa is consistent with the further trimming of the RNA probe from the HA-tagged TTP protein by RNase A. Extracts derived from mock-transfected cells did not contain any HA-containing immune complexes. Taken together, these data indicate that TTP expressed in cells recognizes the AU-rich element in the PAI-2 3′-UTR. It was important to determine whether TTP could influence the post-transcriptional regulation of the PAI-2 gene. TTP has previously been shown to influence cytokine gene expression by associating with AU-rich elements and accelerating the decay rate of the cytokine transcript. To determine whether TTP could act in a similar manner on PAI-2 mRNA, plasmids expressing PAI-2 (pCI-PAI-2) and TTP (pTTP-HA) were co-transfected into HEK293 cells. In this experiment, cells were transfected with a fixed amount of pCI-PAI-2 (5 μg) and increasing amounts (0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 1.0, 5.0 μg) of plasmid pTTP-HA. As shown in Fig. 3panel A, cells transfected with pCI-PAI-2 expressed a PAI-2 transcript (lane 2, middle blot). However, the intensity of this transcript decreased as the expression levels of TTP increased (lanes 3–9). It is also evident that levels of PAI-2 mRNA were significantly reduced at relatively low levels of TTP mRNA expression (e.g. lane 6). Furthermore, higher concentrations of TTP resulted in the formation of a stable but truncated PAI-2 transcript (lanes 7–9; indicated witharrow). The significance of the formation of this truncated PAI-2 transcript is unclear, but it is unlikely to be of physiological significance"
https://openalex.org/W1991331678,"The immediate early gene,cyr61, is transcriptionally activated within minutes by serum and serum growth factors. The encoded Cyr61 protein is secreted into the extracellular matrix and promotes cell adhesion and migration. In this study, we sought to examine the expression profile ofcyr61 gene during neuronal cell death induced by various toxic stimuli and the mechanisms involved. Our data show that toxic stimuli, such as etoposide, significantly increased cyr61 mRNA levels in immortalized hippocampal progenitor (H19-7) cells. Cyr61 transcriptional activation was corroborated at the protein level as well. To identify the upstream signaling cascades involved incyr61 gene induction, the blocking effect of either JNK or p38 kinase-signaling pathway on cyr61 induction in response to etoposide was tested. Transfection of the cells with a kinase-deficient mutant MEKK, an upstream activator of JNK, significantly decreased the cyr61 expression induced by etoposide. In contrast, cyr61 mRNA levels did not change after pretreatment with SB203580, the p38 kinase inhibitor. When the induction of cyr61 was tested by using several of its deleted promoters driving the expression of reporter gene, the promoter activation occurred primarily within the region containing an SRE-like CArG box. In addition, the SRF, which binds to the CArG site, was directly phosphorylated by active JNK. Furthermore, the blockade ofcyr61 gene expression using an antisense encoding cyr61 sequence significantly inhibited the cell death induced by etoposide. Overall, these results suggest that the induction of the immediate early gene, cyr61, is important for neuronal cell death in the central nervous system hippocampal progenitor cells, and JNK activation, but not of p38, as well as the subsequent SRF phosphorylation are involved in cyr61 gene induction. The immediate early gene,cyr61, is transcriptionally activated within minutes by serum and serum growth factors.

Transfection of the cells with a kinase-deficient mutant MEKK, an upstream activator of JNK, significantly decreased the cyr61 expression induced by etoposide. In contrast, cyr61 mRNA levels did not change after pretreatment with SB203580, the p38 kinase inhibitor. When the induction of cyr61 was tested by using several of its deleted promoters driving the expression of reporter gene, the promoter activation occurred primarily within the region containing an SRE-like CArG box. In addition, the SRF, which binds to the CArG site, was directly phosphorylated by active JNK. Furthermore, the blockade ofcyr61 gene expression using an antisense encoding cyr61 sequence significantly inhibited the cell death induced by etoposide. Overall, these results suggest that the induction of the immediate early gene, cyr61, is important for neuronal cell death in the central nervous system hippocampal progenitor cells, and JNK activation, but not of p38, as well as the subsequent SRF phosphorylation are involved in cyr61 gene induction.

A remarkable feature of the CCN protein family is their organization into four conserved modular domains, which share sequence similarities with the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein, the von Willebrand factor type C repeat, and the thrombospondin type 1 repeat (6Chen C.-C. Chen N. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10443-10452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Cyr61 was originally identified in both mouse 3T3 fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and its mRNA is rapidly and transiently expressed by the serum and the serum growth factors (1O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, its recombinant protein is able to support cell adhesion and migration, enhances the proliferative effects of the basic fibroblast growth factor. Cyr61 is expressed during embryogenesis of the circulatory system and the cartilaginous skeleton, and enhances chondrogenesis in vitro (7O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, cyr61gene plays a role during neuronal differentiation (8Chung K.C. Ahn Y.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 255: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and promotes angiogenesis and the growth of certain tumors, probably through its angiogenic potential (9Tsai M.S. Bogart D.F. Li P.

This DNA fragment contains a sequence that resembles the serum response element (SRE) originally identified in the c-fos promoter. A deletion of the cyr61 SRE-like sequence abrogates its serum inducibility. Furthermore, this SRE-like sequence is sufficient to confer induction by the serum and growth factor and binds to a serum response factor (SRF). The SRE mediates c-fos induction in response to the growth factor, cytokines, and other extracellular stimuli that activate the MAPK pathways (12Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). The SRE in the c-fos promoter is comprised of an inner core known as the CArG box, which is recognized by a dimer of the SRF, and the ternary complex factor (TCF), a family of Ets-domain transcription factors (13Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Elk-1 is a member of the TCF family, which is phosphorylated by JNK and p38 as well as by ERK (14Janknecht R. Ernst W.H. Pingoud V. Nordheim A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5097-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 15Yordy J.S. Muise-Helmericks R.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6503-6513Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Several N-terminal phosphorylation sites have been identified within the SRF (16Marais R.M. Hsuan J.J. McGuigan C. Wynne J. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Specifically, the Ser-133 residue in the SRF is phosphorylated by CaM kinase II and IV (17Fluck M. Booth F.W. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 488-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and MAPKAP kinase 1 and 2 (also referred to as MK-1 and MK-2) (18Heidenreich O. Neiningers A.

Although there have been several reports of situations where JNK and/or p38 activation can occur without influencing cell death (19Lenczowski J.M. Dominguez L. Eder A.M. King L.B. Zacharchuk C.M.

Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 23Harper S.J. LoGrasso P. Cell Signal. 2001; 13: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 24Mielke K. Herdegen T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 61: 45-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, the possibility of whether cyr61 is expressed during the neuronal cell death induced by various toxic stimuli was investigated. The cyr61 mRNA levels were found to increase, and its encoded proteins were expressed and subsequently secreted into the extracellular space during etoposide-induced neuronal cell death in the embryonic hippocampal progenitor cells. Furthermore, the induction of cyr61was mediated by the JNK-dependent phosphorylation of SRF, and the blocking of cyr61 expression, through use of an antisense-expressing construct, suppressed the neuronal cell death induced by etoposide. These results suggest that the induction of the angiogenic factor cyr61 plays a key role during neuronal cell death. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), the fetal bovine serum, and the LipofectAMINE reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. The U0126 was purchased from New England BioLabs. The SB203580 and 1,9-pyrazoloanthrone were purchased fromCalbiochem. Both the Protein A-Sepharose and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. The cyr61promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter fusion constructs (−2062cyr61/CAT, −1700cyr61/CAT, ΔBglIIcyr61/CAT, −529cyr61/CAT, CArG-529cyr61/CAT) were prepared, as described previously (11Latinkic B.V. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding antisense Cyr61, pZeoSV-AS-cyr61, was constructed by inserting a 300-nucleotide antisense strand of cyr61 into the XhoI and EcoRI site of pZeoSV vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), causing an overlapping of transcriptional initiation of the start site and an exon 1 portion of thecyr61 gene. The fidelity of plasmid DNA was verified by nucleotide sequence in both strands. The plasmids encoding glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fused to the whole SRF proteins (residues 1–508: pGST-SRF508), N-terminal peptide (residues 1–140; pGST-SRF140), or C-terminal peptide (residues 198–508: pGST-SRF198/508) were kindly provided by K. Sobue (Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan). Mammalian expression vectors encoding kinase-deficient JNK1 (pCMV5-mJNK1) and JNK2 (pSr-HA-JNK2) were provided by J. S. Chun (Kwangju Institute of Science & Technology, Kwangju, Korea). The heterologous plasmids for the SRE-c-fos promoter/luciferase reporter gene (pWTGL3 and ppm18GL3) were provided by R. Prywes (Columbia University, New York, NY). The polyclonal anti-Cyr61 antibodies were prepared as described elsewhere (25Tamura I. Rosenbloom J. Macarak E. Chaqour B. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 1524-1532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immortalized hippocampal H19-7 cells were generated and cultured as described previously (26Eves E.M. Tucker M.S. Roback J.D. Downen M. Rosner M.R. Wainer B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4373-4377Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar,27Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The H19-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and then transiently transfected for 24 h using the LipofectAMINE reagents (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To make antisensecyr61-transfected H19-7 clones, antisense cyr61construct was transfected into H19-7 cells using calcium phosphate. Cells were cultured in medium containing 300 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum in DMEM in 5% CO2 at 33 °C for 14 days, and individual Zeocin-resistant clones were isolated. Cell death was quantified by the trypan blue staining method as described elsewhere (28Chung K.C. Park J.H. Kim C.H. Ahn Y.S. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1482-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Statistical analyses were completed with the aid of the StatView II program for Macintosh computers (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). All data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and preplanned comparisons with the control were performed by Dunnett's tstatistic. Apoptotic cells were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP fluorescein nick end-labeling (TUNEL) using the in situ death detection kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The cells were fixed for 30 min in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase was inactivated by incubation with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated in a permeabilizing solution (0.1% sodium citrate and 0.1% Triton X-100) for 2 min at 4 °C. The cells were labeled by incubation with the TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were labeled with peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Fab fragment) for 30 min at 37 °C and stained with a Vectastain ABS kit (Vector Laboratories). To detect internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, DNA fragmentation assay was performed as described elsewhere (45Lyons A.B. Samuel K. Sanderson A. Maddy A.H. Cytometry. 1992; 13: 809-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The total cellular RNA from the H19-7 cells was isolated by the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The total cellular RNA (10 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing 37% formaldehyde for 2 h and transferred onto nylon membranes by capillary transfer. The cyr61 cDNA was labeled with 32P using a Rediprime II kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the procedure provided by the manufacturer and used as a hybridization probe. Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5× Denhardt's reagent, 6× SSPE, 0.5% SDS at 42 °C for 18 h. After hybridization, the nylon membrane was rinsed twice in 1× SSPE containing 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 20 min, which was then subject to autoradiography at −70 °C for 3 days. For reverse transcription, a 2-μg aliquot of the total RNA was primed with a hexa-deoxyribonucleotide of the random primers (Invitrogen), and the first strand was synthesized using SuperScriptTMII ReverseTranscriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The cDNA/mRNA hybrids were amplified with the sense and antisense primers by PCR. After an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, temperature cycling was initiated for each cycles follows: 94 °C for 30 s, 68 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min for 25 cycles for cyr61, followed by a final elongation step at 72 °C for 10 min. The H19-7 cells were incubated with for 1 h in 10% fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM without methionine prior to labeling. The cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) and stimulated with 85 μm of the etoposide for the indicated times. The cell lysates were prepared, and the recovered culture medium was concentrated using a Centricon YM-30 (with 30-kDa molecular size cut-off). The cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated with the polyclonal anti-Cyr61 serum and analyzed as described elsewhere (27Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CAT assay was carried out with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent CAT assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay kit (Promega) and a luminometer. Cell lysates were prepared from 85 μmetoposide induced H19-7 cells. The lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting using a 1:1000 dilution of anti-phospho-JNK (New England BioLabs), 1:500 dilution of anti-phospho-p38 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-mouse IgG were used as secondary antibodies. The cell extracts were prepared after the H19-7 cells were treated with the etoposide, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with 300 μl of the lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.0% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.4), p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 200 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/μl aprotinin, 1 μg/μl leupeptin). The cell lysates were then incubated with 1 μg of the polyclonal anti-SRF antibodies for 14 h at 4 °C and added to the Protein A-Sepharose gels (Amersham Biosciences). After incubation for 2 h, the gels were washed four times with buffer A. The kinase reaction was carried out as described elsewhere. The gels were mixed with either the wild type or the deleted GST-SRF proteins in 20 μl of the kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 20 mmMgCl2, 20 mm MnCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2.5 μg/μl aprotinin, 2.5 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 20 μm ATP) and [γ-32P]ATP and allowed to incubate at 30 °C for 1 h. After 2-h incubation, the Sepharose gels were treated with the 2% SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were analyzed using PhosphorImager analysis. A 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel was prepared in the presence of 50 μg/ml of the bacterial recombinant wild type GST-SRF508 or the C-terminal deleted GST-SRF140 proteins as a substrate. The total cell extracts were prepared after stimulating the H19-7 cells with the etoposide and then applying them to the gel. All the gel renaturation and phosphorylation protocols were performed as previously described (27Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To examine whether or not IEG cyr61 is induced by various toxic stimuli in H19-7 cells, cyr61 mRNA expression was measured in response to several neurotoxins, such as etoposide, NMDA, or glutamate. As shown in Fig.1A, RT-PCR analysis clearly showed that the expression of a 361-bp fragment of cyr61 was abundantly amplified after being stimulated with 85 μmetoposide for 1 h. Furthermore, cyr61 gene expression increased significantly after stimulation with either 200 μm glutamate or 200 μm NMDA. As a positive control, cells were treated with basic fibroblast growth factor (10 ng/ml), which resulted in cyr61 induction, as previously reported (8Chung K.C. Ahn Y.S. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 255: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In a similar way, Northern blot analysis using the total RNAs isolated after being stimulated with the same concentration of etoposide, NMDA, and glutamate confirmed that IEG cyr61 is rapidly induced by these toxic stimuli (Fig. 1B). To clarify the upstream signal transduction pathways leading to cyr61induction, the effect of the DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide (29Gibson S. Widmann C. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10916-10922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), on cyr61 expression was examined. Etoposide stabilizes the DNA-topoisomerase II complexes by blocking DNA relegation. Initially, the alteration of cell viability was determined in response to various etoposide doses to test how etoposide affects cell viability in H19-7 cells (Fig. 2A). When 10–85 μm etoposide was added to the serum-containing medium, the cell viability decreased in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by the trypan blue staining method. Stimulation of the cells with 85 μm etoposide caused an approximate 51% decrease in cell viability, compared with the control cells. To determine whether the neuronal cell death was due to apoptosis or necrosis, the occurrence of DNA fragmentation was measured by means ofin situ TUNEL method as well as the detection of internucleosomal DNA ladder formation. The treatment with 85 μm etoposide significantly increased the TUNEL-positive cells and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2B). These results indicated that etoposide-treated H19-7 cells die by means of apoptosis. In addition, the effect of etoposide on cyr61 protein synthesis was also examined. Cyr61 protein is well known to be secreted into the extracellular space in a variety of cell types. The H19-7 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and stimulated with 85 μm etoposide, and the cell lysates and cultured media were prepared. The cell lysates and media were immunoprecipitated with the Cyr61 polyclonal antibodies. As shown in Fig. 3, the presence of 42-kDa protein band can be seen, corresponding to the molecular size of Cyr61 in the cell lysates within 5–10 h after the cells were stimulated with etoposide, and up to 24 h after stimulation. In addition, its outer cellular presence was maintained until 48 h after post-etoposide stimulation (Fig. 3). These findings suggest the occurrence of rapid Cyr61 synthesis by etoposide. However, once produced inside the cells, Cyr61 appears to be translocated gradually into the extracellular media. Next we sought to elucidate the upstream signaling pathways leading to the induction ofcyr61. Because the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), consisting of JNK, p38 kinase, and ERK, are potential candidates for cyr61 gene activation, we first examined whether they are activated in response to etoposide in H19-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, both JNK1 and JNK2 were transiently activated within 5–15 min post-etoposide stimulation, whereas no significant levels of active p38 kinase or ERK were detected. To investigate whether the mRNA induction ofcyr61 directly occurs by the JNK-dependent pathway, cells were transfected with kinase-inactive MEKK mutant, an upstream JNK kinase activator in the JNK-signaling cascade, which selectively inhibits JNK activation. As shown in Fig. 4B, the RT-PCR experiment revealed that blocking the JNK pathway results in a significant decrease in etoposide-induced cyr61expression, compared with the mock-transfected cells. However, blocking p38 and ERK activity with specific inhibitors did not significantly affect on cyr61 expression, compared with the control cells (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, Northern blot analysis confirmed that the cyr61 mRNA levels induced by the etoposide were considerably decreased after blocking the JNK pathway in the cells. However, blocking either p38 or ERK had little effect (Fig.4B). This suggests that the etoposide-induced expression ofcyr61 occurs by the JNK-dependent pathway but not by either the ERK or p38 kinase pathway. A 2-kb 5′-flanking DNA fragment of cyr61 gene functions as a serum-inducible promoter (11Latinkic B.V. O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3261-3267Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This DNA fragment contains a sequence resembling the serum response element. The transcriptional activation of the cyr61 gene was examined using a CAT reporter plasmid linked to a 2062-bpcyr61 promoter fragment (−2062cyr61/CAT) transiently expressed in H19-7 cells. Treatment of the H19-7 cells with 85 μm etoposide rapidly stimulated cyr61transcription, which reached a plateau after 4 h, as monitored by CAT activity (Fig. 5A). To analyze the role of the MAPK pathways in the promoter activity ofcyr61, the blocking effect of the ERK, JNK, or p38 kinase pathway was tested using either the chemical inhibitors of ERK and p38 kinase or a plasmid encoding kinase-inactive mutant MEKK (mMEKK) (Fig.5B). Following pretreatment of the H19-7 cells for 30 min with either 30 μm SB203580 or 10 μm U0126, the activation of the cyr61 promoter was unaffected. However, when a plasmid encoding kinase-deficient MEKK mutant and −2062cyr61/CAT-construct were co-transfected into the cells, stimulation with 85 μm etoposide caused significant inhibition of cyr61 induction, compared with control cells transfected with −2062cyr61/CAT alone. This indicates that the etoposide-induced transcriptional activation of the cyr61gene is mediated at least in part by JNK but not by p38 kinase or ERK activation. The results described above indicate that the 2062-bp cyr61 promoter contains a domain responsive to a JNK-dependent signaling pathway, which is activated by etoposide. To identify these domains, the cyr61promoter was subjected to deletion analysis (Fig.6A). The cyr61promoter has one SRF-binding domain (SRE or CArG box) between −1950 and −1900. Deleting this SRE (−1763cyr61/CAT) resulted in a complete loss of the etoposide-activated transcription of cyr61, compared with the −2062cyr61/CAT-transfecetd cells (Fig.6B). A further deletion of the promoter up to −529 (−529cyr61/CAT) had no effect, whereas an intact SRE-containing construct with an internal deletion (ΔBglIIcyr61/CAT) showed a significant increase in cyr61 promoter activity, compared with the −2062cyr61/CAT construct (Fig. 6B). The SRE enhancer region of the cyr61 promoter was further analyzed by linking it to the 529-bp fragment (CArG/−529cyr61/CAT). The results suggest that a domain containing a CArG box is sufficient for the fullcyr61 transcriptional activation by etoposide. The SRE was then tested to determine whether it is sufficient forcyr61 induction or other serum-inducible cis-regulatory elements, such as the TCF-binding motif where its presence appears to be crucial for inducing IEGs during neuronal cell death (27Chung K.C. Gomes I. Wang D. Lau L.F. Rosner M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2272-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Chung K.C. Kim S.M. Rhang S. Lau L.F. Gomes I. Ahn Y.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4676-4684Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, the TCF-binding motif was examined to determine if it acts together with the SRE to mediate a cyr61 induction in a synergistic way. To test this possibility, two heterologous SRE-c-fos promoter/luciferase constructs involving either the SRE alone (ppm18GL3) or a combined TCF-SRE (pWTGL3) were further analyzed (Fig. 7A). The plasmids, pWTGL3 and ppm18GL3, containing the −335 to −285 region of the murine c-fos promoter were constructed by their fusion into the −53 to +45 region of the human c-fos promoter subcloned into the upstream of the firefly luciferase gene in the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega) (31Wang Y. Prywes R. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1379-1385Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7B, irrespective of the mutation in the TCF site to abolish the binding of p62TCF, two heterologous SRE-c-fos promoter constructs showed similar and significant transcriptional activation, as monitored by their luciferase activity (Fig. 7B). Overall, these results suggest that the toxic signal of etoposide converges to the SRE region in the cyr61 promoter. Although the SRE-binding factor, SRF, was reported to be phosphorylated by CaM kinase-II and -IV (17Fluck M. Booth F.W. Waxham M.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The function of FasL during inflammation remains controversial. In this study, we examined the role of vascular endothelial FasL during acute myocardial ischemia-reperfusion that is closely associated with inflammation. Transgenic mouse lines were established that overexpress human FasL on endothelium under the control of the vascular endothelial cadherin promoter. Expression of FasL transgene was detected at both mRNA and protein levels, and functional transgene-encoded FasL protein was specifically expressed on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Transgenic mice developed normally and had normal hearts. When subjected to 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 72 h of reperfusion, myocardial infarct size was reduced by 42% in the transgenic mice compared with nontransgenic littermates (p < 0.05). Moreover, hemodynamic data demonstrated that transgenic hearts performed better following ischemia and reperfusion compared with nontransgenic hearts. Myocardial neutrophil infiltration was reduced by 54% after 6 h of reperfusion in transgenic hearts (p < 0.01). Neutrophil depletion prior to ischemia-reperfusion injury led to smaller infarcts that were not different between transgenic and nontransgenic mice, suggesting that endothelial FasL may attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury by abating the inflammatory response. These results indicate that vascular endothelial FasL may exert potent anti-inflammatory actions in the setting of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.

Cells differ markedly in their sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis due in part to differences in the expression of FLIP, an inhibitor of Fas-mediated death signaling (3Tschopp J. Irmler M. Thome M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Endothelial cells express high levels of FLIP and are relatively resistant to FasL-induced apoptosis (4Sata M.

FasL expression is detected at some immune privileged sites, for example, eye and testis (9Griffith T.S. Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar, 10Bellgrau D. Gold D. Selawry H. Moore J. Franzusoff A. Duke R.C.

Brunner T. Fletcher S.M. Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Science. 1995; 270: 1189-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). Although some studies have shown that FasL expression can promote allograft survival in transplantation models, other studies have reported that ectopic FasL promotes neutrophil infiltration and accelerates rejection (reviewed in Ref. 11Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). FasL-induced inflammatory responses can result from the release of interleukin-1β (12Miwa K. Asano M. Horai R. Iwakura Y. Nagata S. Suda T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and other cytokines that recruit neutrophils (13Hohlbaum A.M. Gregory M.S. Ju S.T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In this regard, it has been shown that ectopic FasL expression in cardiac myocytes promotes proinflammatory cytokine expression, leukocyte infiltration, and hypertrophy (14Nelson D.P. Setser E. Hall D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hewitt T. Klevitsky R. Osinska H. Bellgrau D. Duke R.C. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Heart grafts overexpressing FasL in cardiac myocytes also undergo accelerated rejection, accompanied by massive neutrophil infiltration (15Takeuchi T. Ueki T. Nishimatsu H. Kajiwara T. Ishida T.

Smith C.W. Entman M.L. Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar). Necrotic cardiomyocytes release cytokines causing leukocytes to transmigrate through the endothelium and accumulate at the ischemic site. Once in the myocardium, leukocytes release proteolytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species, causing further damage to the heart. Neutrophils play a critical role in reperfusion injury, and it has been shown that neutrophil depletion results in reduced myocardial infarct size (17Litt M.R. Jeremy R.W. Weisman H.F. Winkelstein J.A. Becker L.C. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1816-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18Romson J.L. Hook B.G. Kunkel S.L. Abrams G.D. Schork M.A. Lucchesi B.R. Circulation. 1983; 67: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar).Besides its expression on immune cells, FasL is also expressed at low levels on the vascular endothelium (4Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Administration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α down-regulates FasL expression in endothelial cells, and overexpression of FasL on the endothelium attenuates leukocyte extravasation induced by TNF-α (19Sata M. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that FasL overexpression on the vascular endothelium of carotid arteries inhibits transplant-associated intimal hyperplasia (20Sata M. Luo Z. Walsh K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6964-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that adenovirus-mediated delivery of FasL to injured vessels inhibits intimal hyperplasia in animals with preexisting immunity to adenovirus (21Luo Z. Sata M. Nguyen T. Kaplan J.M. Akita G.Y. Walsh K. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1776-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Sata M. Perlman H. Muruve D.A. Silver M. Ikebe M. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Walsh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data suggest that when expressed in endothelial cells, FasL may have anti-inflammatory actions.To elucidate further the function of FasL in endothelium, we constructed transgenic mouse lines that stably express FasL in vascular endothelium under the control of the vascular endothelial cadherin (VEcadherin) promoter. When subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, the hearts of VEcadFasL transgenic mice displayed significantly smaller infarct size and a reduction in functional impairment when compared with nontransgenic mice. Consistent with these data, a decrease in neutrophil activity was observed at an early time point in transgenic hearts compared with nontransgenic hearts. No differences in infarct size were seen between transgenic and nontransgenic mice that were treated with cytotoxic anti-neutrophil serum prior to injury. These data support the hypothesis that endothelial FasL acts to minimize neutrophil extravasation and organ damage following ischemia-reperfusion injury.DISCUSSIONIn this study we described the effects of endothelial FasL overexpression on myocardial damage following ischemia-reperfusion injury. We established a new mouse model that specifically expresses FasL in vascular endothelial cells. These mice developed normally and had normal hearts but exhibited a 42% reduction in infarct size following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Consistent with the smaller infarct size, VEcadFasL mouse hearts displayed less functional impairment than nontransgenic mice following the injury. The cardioprotective effect in the transgenic mice may be attributable to a 54% reduction in neutrophil accumulation in the reperfused tissue. Thus, overexpression of FasL on vascular endothelium may serve to minimize neutrophil recruitment, thereby reducing myocardial damage.A number of studies have analyzed the role of the Fas/FasL system in the heart. The α-MyHC-FasL transgenic mice that ectopically express FasL in cardiac myocytes develop mild cardiac hypertrophy associated with interstitial fibrosis and leukocyte inflammation (14Nelson D.P. Setser E. Hall D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hewitt T. Klevitsky R. Osinska H. Bellgrau D. Duke R.C. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis was not observed in the α-MyHC-FasL hearts, other experiments have provided direct evidence that Fas pathway can induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. In the study of Lee et al. (7Lee P. Sata M. Lefer D.J. Factor S.M. Walsh K. Kitsis R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H456-H463Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was shown that FasL expression promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis bothin vivo and in vitro and that Fas-deficientlpr mice displayed less cardiomyocyte apoptosis and correspondingly smaller infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hearts from lpr mice also display fewer apoptotic cellsex vivo after ischemia-reperfusion (31Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and intravenous administration of FasL-blocking antibody attenuates inflammation in the heart and reduces myocardial infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion injury (32Shiraishi H. Toyozaki T. Tsukamoto Y. Saito T. Masuda Y. Hiroshima K. Ohwada H. Kobayashi N. Hiroe M. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inflammation and hypertrophy in α-MyHC-FasL mouse hearts result from chronic, but undetectably low, levels of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes or tissue-resident inflammatory cells (13Hohlbaum A.M. Gregory M.S. Ju S.T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cardiac hypertrophy observed in α-MyHC-FasL mice may result from an activation of intrinsic growth regulatory signaling cascades that promote the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β within cardiac myocytes (33Badorff C. Ruetten H. Mueller S. Stahmer M. Gehring D. Jung F. Ihling C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this regard, Fas is reported to positively affect the growth of a number of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 34Budd R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); however, cell cycle entry in some of these cases may result from the execution of the apoptotic process (for example see Ref. 35Perlman H. Sata M. Krasinski K. Dorai T. Buttyan R. Walsh K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).In contrast to cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells express FasL, and overexpression of FasL in these cells normally does not affect viability or cell cycle status (4Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the overexpression of FasL by the endothelial cells of transgenic mice would be expected to alter immune responses in the absence of cytotoxic or proliferative effects on the endothelium. The marked differences between the heart phenotypes of VEcadFasL and α-MyHC-FasL mice clearly illustrate that FasL can exert either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory actions within an organ depending upon differences in cell type-specific expression or microenvironment. Ectopic expression of FasL in cardiac myocytes leads to inflammation and tissue damage, whereas overexpression of FasL on the vascular endothelium has an anti-inflammatory effect and protects the heart from injury. Similar to our findings in heart, both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of FasL expression have also been observed in other transgenic models. Transgenic mice expressing FasL in pancreatic beta cells display neutrophil infiltration and develop diabetes at a young age (36Kang S.M. Schneider D.B. Lin Z. Hanahan D. Dichek D.A. Stock P.G. Baekkeskov S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In this setting, ectopic expression of FasL will lead to the destruction of Fas-positive islet cells (37Muruve D.A. Nicolson A.G. Manfro R.C. Strom T.B. Sukhatme V.P. Libermann T.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, FasL is expressed on follicular cells of the thyroid (38Stassi G. Di Liberto D. Todaro M. Zeuner A. Ricci-Vitiani L. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Farina F. Zummo G. De Maria R. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and transgenic expression of FasL on thyroid follicular cells prevents thyroid allograft rejection (39Tourneur L. Malassagne B. Batteux F. Fabre M. Mistou S. Lallemand E. Lores P. Chiocchia G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1338-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that FasL-induced inflammation involves FasL that is expressed ectopically, whereas anti-inflammatory effects are associated with overexpression in cell types that normally express endogenous FasL (11Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Neutrophils accumulate at the site of ischemia within hours of reperfusion and damage the tissue by releasing proteases and oxidants (40Dreyer W.J. Michael L.H. West M.S. Smith C.W. Rothlein R. Rossen R.D. Anderson D.C. Entman M.L. Circulation. 1991; 84: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is well established that neutrophil depletion will reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart (17Litt M.R. Jeremy R.W. Weisman H.F. Winkelstein J.A. Becker L.C. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1816-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18Romson J.L. Hook B.G. Kunkel S.L. Abrams G.D. Schork M.A. Lucchesi B.R. Circulation. 1983; 67: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Neutrophils express both Fas and FasL and are susceptible to Fas-mediated cell death (41Liles W.C. Kiener P.A. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that FasL expressed on the endothelial surface may induce apoptosis in Fas-bearing neutrophils, thereby preventing their transmigration to myocardial tissue. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that neutrophil depletion will abrogate the protective action of the FasL transgene on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In contrast, expression of membrane-bound FasL is reported to promote neutrophil chemotaxis (42Shudo K. Kinoshita K. Imamura R. Fan H. Hasumoto K. Tanaka M. Nagata S. Suda T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Gregory M.S. Repp A.C. Holhbaum A.M. Saff R.R. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ksander B.R. J.

Eye Res. 2002; 75: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although FasL has no direct chemoattractant activity (45Behrens C.K. Igney F.H. Arnold B. Moller P. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In these situations, neutrophil chemotaxis may be the indirect result of pro-inflammatory cytokine release that is caused by the cytotoxic activity of FasL (12Miwa K. Asano M. Horai R. Iwakura Y. Nagata S. Suda T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar,13Hohlbaum A.M. Gregory M.S. Ju S.T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These effects may be minimized in the VEcadFasL mice due to the resistance of endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (4Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 46Sata M.

Invest. 1992; 90: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), potentially creating a microenvironment that promotes immunological tolerance to FasL.In summary, we constructed strains of mice that overexpress FasL on the vascular endothelium. These mice were protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart, displaying smaller infarct size, improved performance, and diminished neutrophil infiltration. These data show that endothelial cells can be engineered to express high levels of FasL, leading to reductions in injury-induced inflammation and organ damage. Fas ligand (FasL)1 is a type II membrane protein belonging to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family. It induces apoptosis in various cell types that bear the receptor Fas (also called APO-1 or CD95) (1Nagata S. Golstein P. Science. 1995; 267: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (3965) Google Scholar).

Administration of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α down-regulates FasL expression in endothelial cells, and overexpression of FasL on the endothelium attenuates leukocyte extravasation induced by TNF-α (19Sata M. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that FasL overexpression on the vascular endothelium of carotid arteries inhibits transplant-associated intimal hyperplasia (20Sata M. Luo Z. Walsh K. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6964-6971Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and that adenovirus-mediated delivery of FasL to injured vessels inhibits intimal hyperplasia in animals with preexisting immunity to adenovirus (21Luo Z. Sata M. Nguyen T. Kaplan J.M. Akita G.Y. Walsh K. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1776-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Sata M. Perlman H. Muruve D.A. Silver M. Ikebe M. Libermann T.A. Oettgen P. Walsh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1213-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). These data suggest that when expressed in endothelial cells, FasL may have anti-inflammatory actions. To elucidate further the function of FasL in endothelium, we constructed transgenic mouse lines that stably express FasL in vascular endothelium under the control of the vascular endothelial cadherin (VEcadherin) promoter. When subjected to ischemia-reperfusion, the hearts of VEcadFasL transgenic mice displayed significantly smaller infarct size and a reduction in functional impairment when compared with nontransgenic mice. Consistent with these data, a decrease in neutrophil activity was observed at an early time point in transgenic hearts compared with nontransgenic hearts. No differences in infarct size were seen between transgenic and nontransgenic mice that were treated with cytotoxic anti-neutrophil serum prior to injury. These data support the hypothesis that endothelial FasL acts to minimize neutrophil extravasation and organ damage following ischemia-reperfusion injury. DISCUSSIONIn this study we described the effects of endothelial FasL overexpression on myocardial damage following ischemia-reperfusion injury. We established a new mouse model that specifically expresses FasL in vascular endothelial cells. These mice developed normally and had normal hearts but exhibited a 42% reduction in infarct size following myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. Consistent with the smaller infarct size, VEcadFasL mouse hearts displayed less functional impairment than nontransgenic mice following the injury. The cardioprotective effect in the transgenic mice may be attributable to a 54% reduction in neutrophil accumulation in the reperfused tissue. Thus, overexpression of FasL on vascular endothelium may serve to minimize neutrophil recruitment, thereby reducing myocardial damage.A number of studies have analyzed the role of the Fas/FasL system in the heart. The α-MyHC-FasL transgenic mice that ectopically express FasL in cardiac myocytes develop mild cardiac hypertrophy associated with interstitial fibrosis and leukocyte inflammation (14Nelson D.P. Setser E. Hall D.G. Schwartz S.M. Hewitt T. Klevitsky R. Osinska H. Bellgrau D. Duke R.C. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1199-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although apoptosis was not observed in the α-MyHC-FasL hearts, other experiments have provided direct evidence that Fas pathway can induce apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. In the study of Lee et al. (7Lee P. Sata M. Lefer D.J. Factor S.M. Walsh K. Kitsis R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: H456-H463Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), it was shown that FasL expression promotes cardiomyocyte apoptosis bothin vivo and in vitro and that Fas-deficientlpr mice displayed less cardiomyocyte apoptosis and correspondingly smaller infarct size after ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hearts from lpr mice also display fewer apoptotic cellsex vivo after ischemia-reperfusion (31Jeremias I. Kupatt C. Martin-Villalba A. Habazettl H. Schenkel J. Boekstegers P. Debatin K.M. Circulation. 2000; 102: 915-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and intravenous administration of FasL-blocking antibody attenuates inflammation in the heart and reduces myocardial infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion injury (32Shiraishi H. Toyozaki T. Tsukamoto Y. Saito T. Masuda Y. Hiroshima K. Ohwada H. Kobayashi N. Hiroe M. Lab. Invest. 2002; 82: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is possible that the inflammation and hypertrophy in α-MyHC-FasL mouse hearts result from chronic, but undetectably low, levels of apoptosis in cardiac myocytes or tissue-resident inflammatory cells (13Hohlbaum A.M. Gregory M.S. Ju S.T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the cardiac hypertrophy observed in α-MyHC-FasL mice may result from an activation of intrinsic growth regulatory signaling cascades that promote the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β within cardiac myocytes (33Badorff C. Ruetten H. Mueller S. Stahmer M. Gehring D. Jung F. Ihling C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In this regard, Fas is reported to positively affect the growth of a number of cell types (reviewed in Ref. 34Budd R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar); however, cell cycle entry in some of these cases may result from the execution of the apoptotic process (for example see Ref. 35Perlman H. Sata M. Krasinski K. Dorai T. Buttyan R. Walsh K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 570-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).In contrast to cardiomyocytes, vascular endothelial cells express FasL, and overexpression of FasL in these cells normally does not affect viability or cell cycle status (4Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, the overexpression of FasL by the endothelial cells of transgenic mice would be expected to alter immune responses in the absence of cytotoxic or proliferative effects on the endothelium. The marked differences between the heart phenotypes of VEcadFasL and α-MyHC-FasL mice clearly illustrate that FasL can exert either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory actions within an organ depending upon differences in cell type-specific expression or microenvironment. Ectopic expression of FasL in cardiac myocytes leads to inflammation and tissue damage, whereas overexpression of FasL on the vascular endothelium has an anti-inflammatory effect and protects the heart from injury. Similar to our findings in heart, both pro- and anti-inflammatory effects of FasL expression have also been observed in other transgenic models. Transgenic mice expressing FasL in pancreatic beta cells display neutrophil infiltration and develop diabetes at a young age (36Kang S.M. Schneider D.B. Lin Z. Hanahan D. Dichek D.A. Stock P.G. Baekkeskov S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 738-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In this setting, ectopic expression of FasL will lead to the destruction of Fas-positive islet cells (37Muruve D.A. Nicolson A.G. Manfro R.C. Strom T.B. Sukhatme V.P. Libermann T.A. Hum. Gene Ther. 1997; 8: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In contrast, FasL is expressed on follicular cells of the thyroid (38Stassi G. Di Liberto D. Todaro M. Zeuner A. Ricci-Vitiani L. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Farina F. Zummo G. De Maria R. Nat. Immunol. 2000; 1: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), and transgenic expression of FasL on thyroid follicular cells prevents thyroid allograft rejection (39Tourneur L. Malassagne B. Batteux F. Fabre M. Mistou S. Lallemand E. Lores P. Chiocchia G. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1338-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These data support the hypothesis that FasL-induced inflammation involves FasL that is expressed ectopically, whereas anti-inflammatory effects are associated with overexpression in cell types that normally express endogenous FasL (11Green D.R. Ferguson T.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).Neutrophils accumulate at the site of ischemia within hours of reperfusion and damage the tissue by releasing proteases and oxidants (40Dreyer W.J. Michael L.H. West M.S. Smith C.W. Rothlein R. Rossen R.D. Anderson D.C. Entman M.L. Circulation. 1991; 84: 400-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). It is well established that neutrophil depletion will reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart (17Litt M.R. Jeremy R.W. Weisman H.F. Winkelstein J.A. Becker L.C. Circulation. 1989; 80: 1816-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 18Romson J.L. Hook B.G. Kunkel S.L. Abrams G.D. Schork M.A. Lucchesi B.R. Circulation. 1983; 67: 1016-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). Neutrophils express both Fas and FasL and are susceptible to Fas-mediated cell death (41Liles W.C. Kiener P.A. Ledbetter J.A. Aruffo A. Klebanoff S.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that FasL expressed on the endothelial surface may induce apoptosis in Fas-bearing neutrophils, thereby preventing their transmigration to myocardial tissue. In support of this hypothesis, we have shown that neutrophil depletion will abrogate the protective action of the FasL transgene on myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. In contrast, expression of membrane-bound FasL is reported to promote neutrophil chemotaxis (42Shudo K. Kinoshita K. Imamura R. Fan H. Hasumoto K. Tanaka M. Nagata S. Suda T. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 43Gregory M.S. Repp A.C. Holhbaum A.M. Saff R.R. Marshak-Rothstein A. Ksander B.R. J.

Eye Res. 2002; 75: 475-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although FasL has no direct chemoattractant activity (45Behrens C.K. Igney F.H. Arnold B. Moller P. Krammer P.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3240-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In these situations, neutrophil chemotaxis may be the indirect result of pro-inflammatory cytokine release that is caused by the cytotoxic activity of FasL (12Miwa K. Asano M. Horai R. Iwakura Y. Nagata S. Suda T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar,13Hohlbaum A.M. Gregory M.S. Ju S.T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 6217-6224Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). These effects may be minimized in the VEcadFasL mice due to the resistance of endothelial cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis (4Sata M. Suhara T. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 5Suhara T. Mano T. Oliveira B.E. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 46Sata M.

These mice were protected from ischemia-reperfusion injury in the heart, displaying smaller infarct size, improved performance, and diminished neutrophil infiltration.

Bucher D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28484-28490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) observed that cysteine substitutions at two residues within the pore region of the γ-subunit (human γSer541 and γSer543) led to changes in cation selectivity, suggesting that the channel selectivity filter is restricted to a limited site within the pore region of the γ-subunit. To address the role of residues within the β-subunit in conferring cation selectivity and amiloride sensitivity, we systematically mutated residues within the pore region (βGln523–βIle536) to cysteine (Fig. 1). Mutant βmENaCs were co-expressed with wild type αmENaC and wild type (or C-terminal truncated) γmENaC in Xenopus oocytes, and functional characteristics were examined. As with the α-subunit (8Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), changes in cation selectivity were observed with most mutants within this region. Large (>9-fold) increases in the inhibitory constant of amiloride were observed with mutations at βGly525, βGly529, and βSer531. Responses of mutant channels to sulfhydryl-reactive reagents indicated that the apparent accessibility to (2-aminoethyl) methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide (MTSEA) differed depending on whether a residue preceded or followed the selectivity filter. Furthermore, a putative amiloride-binding site, previously identified on the basis of site-directed mutations that dramatically increase the Ki for amiloride (12Schild L. Schneeberger E. Gautschi I. Firsov D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), was inaccessible to a large sulfhydryl-reactive reagent. Our observations, placed in context with previously published results suggest that ENaC pore regions have an asymmetric organization. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless specified otherwise. Mouse ENaC (α, β, and γ) cDNAs were previously cloned into pBluescript SK(−) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (15Ahn Y.J. Brooker D.R.

Amino acids in the region preceding and transitioning into the M2 region of βmENaC, βGln523–βIle536 (with the exception of βCys534), were individually mutated to cysteine using a polymerase chain reaction method as previously described (8Sheng S.

A truncation of the C terminus of γmENaC (R583X) was generated by insertion of a stop codon. This mutation increases function Na+ channel expression in Xenopus oocytes (16Schild L. Canessa C.M.

All mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing at sequencing facilities at the University of Pennsylvania or the University of Pittsburgh. T3 RNA polymerase (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) was used to synthesize cRNAs for mutant and wild type βmENaCs, wild type αmENaC and γmENaC from linearized DNAs. cRNAs were stored at −80 °C and diluted in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water prior to injection. Xenopus oocytes (stage V-VI) were pretreated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (type IV) in a Ca2+-free saline solution. ENaC cRNAs (1–3 ng/subunit in 50 nl of H2O) were microinjected into oocytes. The oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mmNaHCO3, 0.3 mm Ca(NO3)20.41 mm CaCl2, 0.82 mmMgSO4, 15 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2, supplemented with 10 μg/ml sodium penicillin, 10 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 μg/ml gentamycin sulfate. Whole cell currents were measured 18–96 h after cRNA injections. A two-electrode voltage clamp technique was used to measure the whole cell inward amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing wild type or mutant αβγmENaCs with a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and a TEV 200A Voltage Clamp amplifier (Dagan Corp., Minneapolis, MN). Data acquisition and analyses were performed using pClamp 7.0 software with a Pentium II-based PC (Gateway, 2000 Inc., N. Sioux City, SD). Amiloride-sensitive currents were defined as the difference of the current in the absence and the presence of 0.1 mm amiloride. Higher concentrations of amiloride (1 or 2 mm) were used to define amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes expressing the βG525C, βG529C, and βS531C mutants. Pipettes of borosilicate glass capillaries (Worldwide Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) were utilized to pull electrodes with a micropipette puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl, and the resistances were 0.5–3 megaohms in a 110 mm NaCl bath solution. Oocytes were bathed in a solution containing 110 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.40. For selectivity experiments, separate bath solutions containing either Na+, Li+, or K+ as the predominant cation were used. All measurements were carried out at room temperature (22–25 °C), and the bath solution was continuously perfused at 5 ml/min by gravity. Oocytes were typically incubated in the bath solution for at least 10 min before the current was recorded to allow currents to stabilize. Membrane potentials were clamped from −140 to +60 mV in 20-mV increments with the duration of 900 ms. Currents were measured at 600 ms after initiation of the clamp potential. Intersweep potential was held at the reverse potential. Macroscopic currents were recorded with each bath solution when stable membrane potentials were observed. Amiloride inhibitory constants (Ki) were determined by nonlinear regression analysis with Origin program 5.0 (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA), using the equation,I/Io=Kin′Kin′+[B]n′(Eq. 1) where Io and I represent inward current carried by Na+ at −100 mV clamping potential in the absence and presence of amiloride (B), respectively, andn′ is the Hill coefficient. To determine cation selectivity of wild type and mutant channels, oocytes were sequentially perfused with bath solutions containing K+, Na+, or Li+ as the predominant cation. Oocytes were subsequently bathed in the K+, Na+, or Li+solutions supplemented with 0.1 or 2 mm amiloride. Amiloride-sensitive currents measured at −100 mV were used to calculate the ratios of the K+ current (IK) and Li+ current (ILi) relative to the Na+ current (INa). The accessibility of mutant channels with cysteine substitutions within the pore region to sulfhydryl reagents was examined using the sulfhydryl-reactive reagents MTSEA and [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl]methanethiosulfonate bromide (MTSET) (Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc., North York, Canada). Na+ currents were measured before and 3 min following perfusion of oocytes with the methanethiosulfonate (MTS) reagent. Oocytes were washed with an MTS-free NaCl bath solution for >10 min to determine the reversibility of the current response. A bath solution containing 0.1 or 1.0 mm amiloride was then perfused into the oocyte chamber to determine the amiloride-insensitive component of the whole cell current. Rates of inhibition of Na+ currents by MTSEA were determined by clamping the membrane potential every 5 s at −100 and +60 mV for 900 ms following the arrival of the reagent to the recording chamber. Currents were measured at 600 ms after the initiation of the −100 mV clamp potential. Intersweep potential was held at the reverse potential. The time course of MTSEA inhibition of the currents is shown as relative currents plotted against time. The time constants were obtained by fitting the data with single exponential decay. The rates of inhibition were determined by the equation,R=(1/T)/C(Eq. 2) where R, T, and C represent the rate (m−1 s−1), time constant (s), and MTSEA concentration (m), respectively. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Student's t test was used for significance analyses with MS Excel 97 software. Several algorithms predicted that the second membrane-spanning domain of αmENaC begins between residues αVal590 and αSer592 (8Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The corresponding residues within βmENaC are βVal532 and βCys534 (see Fig. 1). In order to examine the role of residues within the pore region of the β-subunit in conferring cation selectivity, 13 of the 14 residues in the region preceding and transitioning into the second transmembrane domain of βmENaC, from βGln523 through βIle536, were individually mutated to cysteine. βCys534 is a naturally occurring cysteine. The functional characteristics of these βmENaC mutations were determined by their co-expression with wild type α- and γmENaC in Xenopusoocytes (Table I). Average whole cell amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents ranged from −1.6 to −12.5 μA for both wild type and mutant mENaCs, with the exception of αβG529Cγ and αβS531Cγ, whose whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents were less than −400 nA at −100 mV (data not shown). We previously observed that channels with cysteine residues at the analogous sites within αmENaC expressed low levels of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (8Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D.

In order to enhance levels of current expression with these mutants, βG529C and βS531C were co-expressed with wild type α-subunit and a γ-subunit with a truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (γR583X; see Table I). Na+ currents measured in oocytes expressing αβγR583X were 1.9-fold greater than in oocytes expressing wild type αβγENaC (see Table I), although no change in channel cation selectivity and only a modest (less than 2-fold) change in theKi for amiloride were observed.Table IExpressed amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents, Li+/Na+ and K+/Na+ current ratios, and inhibitory constant for amiloride (Ki) (mean ± S.E.

We also observed that αβG525Cγ exhibited a 1400-fold increase in the amiloride Ki, when compared with wild type ENaC (Table I and Fig. 2). Amiloride is a pore blocker, and we examined whether the substitution of cysteine residues at other sites altered the Ki for amiloride. Large increases in the Ki for amiloride inhibition were observed when cysteine residues were placed at two sites (βG529C and βS531C; Table I and Fig. 2). These sites are within the critical three-residue tract within ENaC subunits (8Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol.

Modest increases in theKi for amiloride inhibition were observed when cysteine residues were placed at other sites, including βPhe526, βVal532, and βLeu533. The Hill coefficients for wild type ENaC and all mutants examined, except for αβG529CγR583X, were between 0.74 and 0.99. The Hill coefficient for αβG529CγR583X was 0.36, suggesting that this mutation led to negative cooperative interactions among sites within the channel that participate in amiloride binding. The cation selectivities of wild type and β-subunit mutant mENaCs were determined by measuring the ratio of inward Li+ or K+ whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents (ILi andIK) relative to the inward amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) at a holding potential of −100 mV. Data are summarized in Table I and Figs. 3 and4. Oocytes expressing wild type αβγmENaC exhibited anILi/INa of 1.88 ± 0.14 and no detectable amiloride-sensitive inward current when bathed in a solution with K+ as the predominant cation, in agreement with previous studies (8Sheng S.

Cysteine substitutions at multiple sites within the βmENaC pore region altered theILi/INa of the channel, similar to that observed following cysteine substitutions within this region of the α-subunit (8Sheng S. Li J. McNulty K.A. Avery D. Kleyman T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8572-8581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The introduction of a cysteine residue at 9 of 13 sites with this region of β-subunit pore altered theILi/INa of the channel, although the changes inILi/INa of αβI536Cγ were modest. Increases in the Li+ to Na+current ratio of the channel were frequently observed and varied from 2.25 ± 0.14 to 5.56 ± 1.16. Two mutants exhibited a significant reduction in channel ILi/INa. The mutants αβF526Cγ and αβG529CγR583X exhibitedILi/INa of 1.20 ± 0.03 (p < 0.01, n = 6) and 0.30 ± 0.09 (p < 10−8, n = 5), respectively. The results suggest that multiple residues in the vicinity of the 3-residue tract of βENaC (βGly529–βSer531) that primarily governs ENaC selectivity affect, either directly or indirectly, cation selectivity.Figure 4Selected mutations within the 3-residue GGS tract of the selectivity filter alter cation selectivity.Representative whole cell currents recorded in oocytes expressing either wild type ENaC, αβG529CγR583X, or αβS531CγR583X are illustrated in A. Whole cell currents were determined in oocytes bathed in a solution containing Na+, Li+, or K+ at test potentials between −140 mV to +60 mV (20-mV increments). Whole cell currents recorded in oocytes expressing wild type ENaC in the presence of 100 μm amiloride are also shown. Dashed lines indicate zero current. Amiloride-sensitive current-voltage relationships of wild type, αβG529CγR583X, and αβS531CγR583X were obtained in the presence of K+(●), Na+ (▪), or Li+ (▴) bath solutions (B).

As previously observed (11Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the introduction of a cysteine residue at βGly529 resulted in channels that were permeable to K+ (Table I; Figs. 3 and4). The IK/INa for βG529C (8.9 ± 3.6, n = 5) was remarkably different (p < 0.001) from wild type. This channel (αβG529CγR583X) displayed outward rectification and its reverse potential in a K+ bath shifted markedly to the right compared with wild type ENaC (Fig. 4). Kellenberger et al.(11Kellenberger S. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Gautschi I. Schneeberger E. Schild L. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 13-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) previously observed that placement of an alanine residue at βGly529 resulted in channels that restricted K+ permeation but reversed the channelILi/INa. In agreement with these data, we observed that αβG529AγR583X channels had an IK/INa 0.013 ± 0.013 (n = 7, p > 0.90versus wild type) and anILi/INa of 0.60 ± 0.01 (n = 7, p < 0.0001versus wild type). These results indicate that βG529 is the only residue in the region of this study crucial for K+ exclusion, supporting the dominant role of the 3-residue (G/S)XS tract in the determination of ENaC cation selectivity. We examined the accessibility of extracellular MTSEA and MTSET to substituted cysteine residues within the pore region of βmENaC by measuring the effect of these MTS reagents on amiloride-sensitive whole cell Na+ currents. The addition of 0.5 mm MTSEA to the bath solution resulted in an irreversible decrease of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current by 28 ± 9% (n = 8; Figs. 5 and 6), in agreement with previous observations and reflects, in part, modification of Cys547 in the pore region of γmENaC by MTSEA (9Snyder P.M.

The response of αβγR583X to MTSEA was similar to wild type ENaC (data not shown). The effects of external MTSEA on whole cell Na+ currents in oocytes expressing β-subunit mutants were examined in order to identify residues within pore region accessible to MTSEA. Fractional amiloride-sensitive currents remaining following external MTSEA are shown in Fig. 5A. Cysteine substitutions at only 4 of 13 sites within the pore region of βmENaC resulted in significantly greater MTSEA-mediated inhibition of amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents than wild type mENaC. These residues were not contiguous but were either flanked by (βF524C, βG525C, and βL533C) or were within (βG530C) the 3-residue tract (βGly529–βSer531) that has a critical role in excluding K+ from the channel pore. Both αβG525Cγ and αβL533Cγ responded to MTSEA with >80% inhibition of amiloride-sensitive INa.Figure 6Representative whole cell recordings (A) and I/V relationships (B) were obtained in the absence or presence of MTSEA in oocytes expressing wild type ENaC, αβG525Cγ, or αβL533Cγ.

If this model is correct, the relative accessibility of βGly525 and βLeu533 to MTSEA should differ, and this difference should be reflected in the rates of channel inhibition in response to MTSEA. Fig. 7illustrates the rate of current loss over the initial 180 s following the addition of MTSEA to the bath solution. The rate of current reduction in response to MTSEA for αβG525Cγ channels (36.7 ± 1.1 m−1 s−1,n = 6) was approximately twice the rate observed for αβGL533Cγ channels (17.4 ± 1.4 m−1s−1, n = 5, p < 0.001) (Fig. 7 and Table II).

https://openalex.org/W1974594597,"In <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, two highly conserved proteins, Rvb1p/Tih1p and Rvb2p/Tih2p, have been demonstrated to be major components of the chromatin-remodeling INO80 complex. The mammalian orthologues of these two proteins have been shown to physically associate with the TATA-binding protein (TBP)<i>in vitro</i> but not clearly <i>in vivo</i>. Here we show that yeast proteins interact with TBP under both conditions. To assess the functional importance of these interactions, we examined the effect of mutating both <i>TIH2/RVB2</i> and <i>SPT15</i>, which encodes TBP, on yeast cell growth. Intriguingly, only those<i>spt15</i> mutations that affected the ability of TBP to bind to the TATA box caused synthetic growth defects in a<i>tih2-ts160</i> background. This suggests that Tih2p might be important in recruiting TBP to the promoter. A DNA microarray technique was used to identify genes differentially expressed in the<i>tih2-ts160</i> strain grown at the restrictive temperature. Only 34 genes were significantly and reproducibly affected; some up-regulated and others down-regulated. We compared the transcription of several of these Tih2p target genes in both wild type and various mutant backgrounds. We found that the transcription of some genes depends on functions possessed by both Tih2p and TBP and that these functions are substantially impaired in the<i>spt15</i>/<i>tih2-ts160</i> double mutants that confer synthetic growth defects."

Increased Km values, decreasedVmax values, and decreasedkcat values with both polyamine substrates, spermidine and spermine, indicated that L156F-SSAT is an inferior and less efficient acetyltransferase than wild-type SSAT. Transfection of L156F-SSAT into C55.7Res cells indicated that cellular SSAT activity per nanogram of SSAT protein correlated well with the in vitro data and was also ∼20-fold less for the mutant protein than for wild-type SSAT. Increased expression of L156F-SSAT was unable to restore cellular sensitivity to BE 3-3-3 despite providing measurable basal SSAT activity. Only a 4-fold induction of L156F-SSAT activity resulted from the exposure of cells to the polyamine analogue, whereas wild-type SSAT was induced ∼300-fold. Degradation studies indicated that BE 3-3-3 cannot prevent ubiquitination of L156F-SSAT and is therefore unable to protect the mutant protein from degradation. These studies indicate that the decreased cellular sensitivity to BE 3-3-3 is caused by the lack of SSAT activity induction in the presence of the analogue due to its inability to prevent the rapid degradation of the L156F-SSAT protein."
https://openalex.org/W2007595490,"In most eukaryotic organisms, cytochromec1 is encoded in the nucleus, translated on cytosolic ribosomes, and directed to its final destination in the mitochondrial inner membrane by a bipartite, cleaved, amino-terminal presequence. However, in the kinetoplastids and euglenoids, the cytochrome c1 protein has been shown to lack a cleaved presequence; a single methionine is removed from the amino terminus upon maturation, and the sequence upstream of the heme-binding site is generally shorter than that of the other eukaryotic homologs. We have used a newly developed mitochondrial protein import assay system from Trypanosoma brucei to demonstrate that theT. brucei cytochrome c1 protein is imported along a non-conservative pathway similar to that described for the inner membrane carrier proteins of other organisms. This pathway requires external ATP and an external protein receptor but is not absolutely dependent on a membrane potential or on ATP hydrolysis in the mitochondrial matrix. We propose the cytochromec1 import in T. brucei is a two-step process first involving a membrane potential independent translocation across the outer mitochondrial membrane followed by heme attachment and a membrane potential-dependent insertion into the inner membrane.

Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In many cases, mitochondrial protein import is receptor-mediated, is dependent upon an inner mitochondrial membrane potential, and requires the hydrolysis of ATP both in the cytosol and in the mitochondrial matrix. Constellations of proteins in the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and in the intermembrane space (IMS)1 have been implicated in the recognition, transfer, and integration of proteins from the cytosol (reviewed in Ref. 3Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Many of the imported mitochondrial proteins (notably the Rieske iron-sulfur protein (ISP) subunit of the cytochrome c reductase complex) have a bipartite, amino-terminal presequence that directs the proteins along a conservative sorting pathway; the first part of the presequence directs the protein into the mitochondrial matrix, and the second part of the signal causes the protein to be sorted into or through the inner mitochondrial membrane to its final destination (4Hartl F.-U. Schmidt B. Wachter E. Weiss H. Neupert W. Cell. 1986; 47: 939-951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The cytochrome c1 subunit of the cytochromec reductase complex of most eukaryotic organisms is synthesized as a preprotein with a long (60–80 amino acids) amino-terminal extension that has been shown to direct the import of the protein into the mitochondrion in the presence of a membrane potential (5Sadler I.

Although the cytochrome c1presequence does possess the characteristics of a typical conservative sorting signal and is processed in two distinct steps on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane, the precise pathway used for the import of this protein has remained controversial (9Nicholson D.W. Stuart R.A. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10156-10168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Glick B.S. Beasley E.M. Schatz G. Trends Biol. Sci. 1992; 17: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In contrast to the typical conservatively sorted preprotein, the cytochromec1 preprotein does not appear to require the presence of matrix ATP for import and sorting (11Stuart R.A. Gruhler A. van der Klei I. Guiard B. Koll H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 12Wachter C. Schatz G. Glick B.S.

To explain this observation, some researchers (14Gruhler A. Ono H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1349-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have suggested that the preprotein may bypass the ATP-requiring matrix chaperones by “looping” through the matrix on its way to the inner membrane along the conservative sorting pathway. Others (15van Loon A.P.G.M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2441-2448Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 16van Loon A.P.G.M. Brandli A.W. Pesold-Hurt B. Blank D. Schatz G.

Cell. 1992; 69: 809-822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) have suggested that a stretch of hydrophobic residues located within the amino-terminal presequence may act to arrest the transfer of the preprotein within the inner mitochondrial membrane (stop-transfer pathway), thus preventing the mature part of the protein from having any contact with the matrix. Regardless of the exact pathway, there is general agreement that cytochrome c1 protein import requires a membrane potential and external ATP (but not matrix ATP) and that the preprotein is processed first by the matrix processing protease and then by the Imp2 protease on the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane (9Nicholson D.W.

In addition, cytochrome c1 heme lyase, an enzymatic activity that is localized in the IMS, is required to form two covalent thioester bonds between the vinyl groups of hemeb and the cysteines in the CXXCH motif of the apoprotein (9Nicholson D.W.

Chem. 1982; 257: 13042-13047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) before the protein can be assembled into the reductase complex. Recent work has shown that the carboxyl-terminal region of the yeast cytochrome c1 protein contains a previously unrecognized targeting signal that acts in a membrane potential-dependent fashion to insert the α-helical membrane anchor of the protein into the inner membrane so that the mature protein has the proper Nout-Cinorientation (23Arnold I. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1469-1476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Apparently, both the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal targeting sequences are required by the yeast system for proper membrane insertion and orientation because the carboxyl-terminal signal, by itself, could direct the import to the intermembrane space of only a limited fragment of the yeast cytochromec1 protein. Our previous analysis of the kinetoplastid c1cytochromes has shown that an essential element that is required by both the stop-transfer pathway and the conservative sorting pathway models, namely a cleaved amino-terminal presequence, is totally absent; a single methionine is removed from the amino terminus of the kinetoplastid c1 cytochromes to form the mature protein (24Priest J.W. Wood Z.A. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The absence of a cleaved presequence on thesec1 cytochromes suggested that they might be imported into the mitochondrion along an alternative type of pathway that bypasses the mitochondrial matrix altogether. In Neurospora crassa, several types of proteins are imported into the mitochondrion in the absence of a cleavable presequence and along alternative pathways. The cytochrome c import pathway into the IMS does not utilize a receptor nor does it require a membrane potential or the hydrolysis of ATP (reviewed in Ref. 25Stuart R.A. Neupert W. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Import, which has been shown to require the presence of heme, a source of reducing equivalents, and a functional cytochrome c heme lyase, is thought to be driven by a conformational change that results from holoprotein formation (26Nicholson D.W. Kohler H. Neupert W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 164: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Nicholson D.W. Hergersberg C. Neupert W. J. Biol.

Cytochrome c heme lyase is itself imported into the IMS in the absence of a cleaved presequence. Import requires a membrane receptor but is not dependent upon either ATP hydrolysis or a membrane potential (29Lill R. Stuart R.A. Drygas M.E. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 449-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 30Diekert K. Kispal G. Guiard B. Lill R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11752-11757Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The enzyme is thought to be associated with the mitochondrial membrane. The ATP/ADP carrier protein (AAC) and other inner membrane metabolite carrier molecules are imported along a receptor-mediated pathway to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane in the absence of a membrane potential and without matrix ATP hydrolysis (31Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sollner T. Pfaller R. Griffiths G. Pfanner N. Neupert W.

Chem. 1998; 273: 16374-16381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). External ATP is required to maintain import competence (36Pfanner N. Tropschug M. Neupert W. Cell. 1987; 49: 815-823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to the other pathways, a membrane potential is required for the assembly of the AAC dimer and insertion of the functional complex into the inner membrane (33Koehler C.M. Jarosch E. Tokatlidis K. Schmid K. Schweyen R.J. Schatz G. Science. 1998; 279: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 34Ryan M.T. Muller H. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20619-20627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Because the kinetoplastid cytochromec1 must be inserted into the inner membrane, the AAC-type pathway seemed the most likely candidate of the alternative pathways that have been described so far. In this work we demonstrate that the Trypanosoma bruceicytochrome c1 is indeed imported along an alternative pathway. The import, membrane insertion, and proper orientation of the mature protein in the membrane are likely directed by a carboxyl-terminal signal sequence similar to the one described in the yeast system. Given that the T. brucei Rieske ISP subunit of the cytochrome c reductase complex is processed differently in these organisms than in other eukaryotes (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), we suggest that the assembly of the reductase complex may be different in the trypanosomes. A PCR was used to generate a coding sequence clone of the T. brucei cytochrome c1 using aTaqI genomic clone of the gene as target. 2J. W. Priest and S. L. Hajduk, unpublished observations.Deoxyoligonucleotides XD-1 (5′-ATGGCAGGTAAGAAAGCTCAC-3′) and OR-21 (5′-CTCTCGCTCCACATCATACAGGC-3′) were used for hot start PCR with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase as directed by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The resulting 816-bp product (GenBankTMaccession number AF102980; Fig. 1A) was cloned into theSmaI restriction site of Bluescript SK+ plasmid (Stratagene). Cleavage of the clone with BamHI generated a template for RNA synthesis with T7 RNA polymerase. A cDNA clone (pPNE-6) of the mitochondrial matrix HSP70 fromCrithidia fasciculata in Bluescript SK−(GenBankTM accession number M95682) was kindly provided by Dr. Paul Englund (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore) (38Effron P.N. Torri A.F. Engman D.M. Donelson J.E. Englund P.T. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 59: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Because the 1944-bp coding sequence did not transcribe and translate efficiently in vitro, the clone was shortened by excision of an EcoRV fragment from the 3′ end. The open reading frame of the resulting clone included the first 678 bp of the HSP70 coding sequence and terminated at an in-frame stop codon 54 bp downstream of the EcoRV restriction site in the Bluescript plasmid sequence. Thus the 26-kDa truncated HSP70 translation product (HSP70ΔRV) contained the 20-amino acid, cleaved, amino-terminal presequence, 206 amino acids of the mature HSP70 sequence, and 18 amino acids of unrelated sequence from the plasmid. The clone was cleaved with HinfI to generate a template for RNA synthesis with T3 RNA polymerase. The clone for the T. brucei Rieske ISP of the cytochrome bc1 complex was cleaved and transcribed as described previously (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 5′-7-Methyl-GpppG capped mRNA was synthesized from the plasmid templates using either the mMessage mMachine in vitrotranscription kit (Ambion) or the method described previously (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). If the latter method was used, the cap was often deleted from the cytochrome c1 reaction because this was not found to be necessary for efficient translation. In vitrotranslations were performed using a rabbit reticulocyte translation system (Promega) with [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). T. brucei (TREU 667) procyclic cells were grown in shaking cultures, collected by centrifugation, and lysed in a nitrogen cavitation bomb as described previously (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A crude mitochondrial fraction was isolated by differential centrifugation and stored in 50% glycerol storage buffer (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). A modified lysis, storage, and dilution buffer (0.25m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS/KOH (MOPS/KOH, MOPS buffer adjusted to pH 7.2 with KOH), pH 7.2, and 2 mm EDTA) (SME-20) was used to improve the reproducibility of the import reactions (39Bertrand K.I. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 106: 249-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Protein import reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte translation mixture to 20 μl of mitochondria (about 100 μg of protein from 1.5 × 108 cells) in basal import buffer composed of 0.25m sucrose, 20 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (final concentrations). The “complete” import buffer used in some reactions was made by supplementing basal import with an ATP-regenerating system (10 mm creatine phosphate, 0.1 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 2 mm ATP) and an energizing mixture (8 mm potassium ascorbate, 0.2 mmN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylphenylenediamine, and 5 mm NADH). Reactions were terminated by transfer to 4 °C, and the mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Unless otherwise indicated, pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of SME-20 buffer containing 30 μg/ml proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and digested at room temperature for 15 min. Antimycin A (15 μm) and oligomycin (30 μm) or carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (50 μm) and valinomycin (0.5 μm) were included in the indicated reactions to dissipate the membrane potential and thereby decrease the possibility of continued import during the protease digestion step. Following the addition of 1 volume of ice-cold SME-20 containing 4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), the mitochondria were again collected by centrifugation. Labeled proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, visualized by fluorography, and quantitated by storage phosphor autoradiography (Amersham Biosciences model 400E PhosphorImager) as described previously (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The analysis of imported proteins in the presence of proteinase K and the detergent CHAPS was performed by acetone precipitation as described previously (37Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20060-20069Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Scaled up import reactions (500-μl final volume containing 100 μl of reticulocyte lysate and the mitochondria from ∼3.0 × 109 cells) were performed for ISP, cytochrome c1, and cytochromec1 in the presence of 100 μm CCCP using basal import buffer supplemented with the ATP-regenerating system described above. Following a 30-min incubation at room temperature, the mitochondria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 500 μl of SME-20 buffer containing 30 μg/ml of proteinase K, 30 μm oligomycin, and 15 μm antimycin A. After a 15-min digestion at room temperature, 500 μl of SME-20 buffer containing 4 mm PMSF were added, and the mitochondria were again collected by centrifugation. The mitochondria from each import reaction were resuspended in 500 μl of SME-20 containing 1 mm PMSF and loaded onto the top of linear sucrose gradients as described by Opperdoes et al. (40Opperdoes F.R. Borst P. Bakker S. Leene W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 76: 29-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (1.18–2.0m sucrose with 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA on top of a cushion of 0.8 ml of 2.5 msucrose in the same buffer). The gradients were centrifuged for 17 h at 30,000 rpm (60,000 × g at the sample zone) at 6 °C in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments). Gradients were fractionated (12 times, 1 ml) from the bottom of the centrifuge tubes using a pump and a thin capillary tube to minimize mixing. The fractions were numbered in reverse order so that fraction 1 represented the top (least dense) fraction of the gradient. Each sucrose gradient fraction was slowly diluted with 9 ml of 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, with gentle vortexing and then centrifuged for 15 min at 15,700 × g at 4 °C in a swinging bucket rotor (10,000 rpm; Beckman Instruments JS 13.1 rotor). Mitochondrial pellets were dissolved in 50 μl of SDS sample loading buffer with 2 mm PMSF. The proteins from each fraction (20 μl/lane) were resolved on 12% polyacrylamide minigels and electrotransfered onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore). The blots were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the T. brucei cytochromec1. 3Z. A. Wood and S. L. Hajduk, unpublished observations.The rabbit serum was diluted 1:200 in phosphate-buffered saline (0.85% NaCl and 10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.2) (PBS) containing 0.3% Tween 20 (Tween/PBS).

Nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate were used to visualize the bound antibodies. As an additional confirmation that the anti-cytochromec1 antibody was indicating the correct location of the mitochondria on the sucrose gradient, one of the blots was probed with a mouse monoclonal antibody against the Rieske ISP of the cytochrome bc1 complex (III.30.21.3 ascites diluted 1:125 in Tween/PBS) (41Priest J.W. Hajduk S.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A biotin-labeled rat anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody was used as the secondary antibody for this blot (1:1000 in Tween/PBS; Zymed Laboratories Inc.). The Western blots were sprayed with En3Hance and exposed to x-ray film as directed by the manufacturer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Two additional 12% polyacrylamide gels (10 μl/lane from the cytochrome c1 import reaction gradient) were run to examine the protein profiles of the sucrose gradient fractions. One gel was transferred to a PVDF membrane, which was stained with AuroDye Forte as directed by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For a more accurate indication of the relative protein contents of each gradient fraction, the second gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (42Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Mitochondria from ∼3 × 108 cells (containing about 200 μg of protein) were resuspended in 100 μl of SME-20 buffer with proteinase K at various concentrations (0.1, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5, and 15 μg/ml). After a 15-min incubation at 4 °C, the samples were diluted with 9 volumes of cold SME-20 containing 1 mm PMSF, and the mitochondria were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. Control reactions (no addition during the initial incubation step at 4 °C) were diluted with 900 μl of either SME-20 buffer alone, SME-20 buffer with 1 mm PMSF, or SME-20 buffer with 1 mm PMSF and 1.5 μg of proteinase K (equivalent to the amount of protease found in the 15 μg/ml digestion). Mitochondrial pellets were washed once (without resuspension) with 150 μl of SME-20 with 1 mm PMSF. The mitochondrial pellets were then resuspended in 40 μl of import buffer with an ATP-regenerating system and the energizing mixture and were incubated with 10 μl of labeled rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 30 min at room temperature. Mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 μl of SME-20 buffer. One-half of each sample was collected by centrifugation, run on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and stained with Coomassie Blue. The other half of each sample was treated with 30 μg/ml proteinase K and analyzed as described for the standard import reaction. Sequences were aligned using the ClustalW program of Thompson et al.

ATP and ADP were made as 100 mm concentrated stocks at pH 7.2 and kept at −80 °C until use. A concentrated stock (1000 units/ml) of potato apyrase (grade VIII) was made in 20 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2. Atractyloside (potassium salt) was dissolved in water at a concentration of 10 mm. An inhibitory concentration of 400 μm atractyloside was chosen for the assays based upon studies done in Euglena gracilis by Datta and Kahn (45Datta D.B. Kahn J.S. J. Protozool. 1977; 24: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Valinomycin, CCCP, oligomycin, antimycin-A (mixture), and PMSF were made as 100-fold concentrated stocks in ethanol.

As with the E. gracilis cytochrome c1and the other kinetoplastid c1 cytochromes that have been cloned to date (24Priest J.W. Wood Z.A. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the T. brucei sequence does not have an amino-terminal extension that might act as a signal for protein import into the mitochondrion; the initial methionine (Met-1) of the protein aligns in close proximity with the mature amino termini of the yeast and E. gracilis proteins (Met-62 and Gly-2, respectively) (indicated in green). If the T. brucei cytochrome c1 is processed in the same manner as the C. fasciculata protein (24Priest J.W. Wood Z.A. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1992; 267: 20188-20195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mature amino terminus is formed by the removal of a single methionine residue to reveal Ala-2 (green arrowhead). Given that the kinetoplastid and euglenoid c1cytochromes lack the amino-terminal targeting sequence found in other eukaryotes, what sequence could act in its place? The trypanosome and other kinetoplastid cytochromes c1 (but not theE. gracilis protein) do contain a cluster of positively charged residues at the amino terminus (Fig. 1A,italics) that might play a role in protein import (24Priest J.W. Wood Z.A. Hajduk S.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 229-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although their precise role is unclear, concentrations of positively charged residues have been found at the amino terminus of a number of imported trypanosome mitochondrial proteins (37Priest J.W.

The T. brucei protein also has a region near the carboxyl terminus that is predicted to form a membrane-spanning α-helix (Fig.1A, amino acids 222–238 indicated byunderlines).

However, T4 early transcripts are also inactivated by the phage-encoded RegB protein synthesized shortly after infection (3Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Troitskayadagger E. Mathy N. Uzan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, RegB probably also cleaves essential host messengers. Indeed, it exerts a strong bacteriostatic/lethal effect onEscherichia coli cells (7Uzan M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 1F. Saida, M. Uzan, J.-Y. Lallemand, and F. Bontems, submitted for publication.1F. Saida, M. Uzan, J.-Y. Lallemand, and F. Bontems, submitted for publication. However, the in vitro activity of RegB is very low compared with its in vivo efficiency. In this context, of particular interest is the observation that the enzyme activity can be enhanced by a factor of up to 100 by the E. coli 30 S ribosomal subunit (9Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the S1 protein alone is sufficient to achieve the same level of stimulation (9Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Working on the properties of RegB, we wished to analyze how S1 promotes RegB reaction. S1 is the largest E. coli ribosomal protein (for review, see Ref. 10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is found in all Gram-negative and in several Gram-positive bacteria (11Farwell M.A. Roberts M.W. Rabinowitz J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3375-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A smaller form has also been described in plant chloroplasts (12Franzetti B. Carol P. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19075-19081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein plays an essential role in the initiation of translation (13Sorensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is, in particular, required for the translation of messengers possessing weak (14Roberts M.W. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2228-2235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or no (15Tzareva N.V. Makhno V.I. Boni I.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) Shine-Dalgarno consensus sequence. It is thus likely that it facilitates or even supplements the interactions between the Shine-Dalgarno region of the messenger and the 16 S ribosomal RNA. In addition, S1 is used by several phages. Besides its role in RegB activation, it is one of the four subunits of the replicase of RNA bacteriophages (for review, see Ref. 16van Duin J. Fraenkel-Conrad H. Wagner R. The Virus. Plenum, New York1988: 116-166Google Scholar) and it interacts with the β-protein of phage λ (17Muniyappa K. Mythili E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both its physiological function and its role in the RegB system involve the Shine-Dalgarno region suggests that S1 recognizes a similar signal in both cases. However, the nature of this signal is still an open question. The protein is able to bind poly(A), poly(U), and poly(C) oligonucleotides (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Using a procedure based on UV cross-linking, the S1-binding site on Qβ phage mRNA was shown to contain a poly(U) stretch located upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno GGAG sequence (18Boni I.V. Isaeva D.M. Musichenko M.L. Tzareva N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but other results indicate that S1 can also act as a poly(A)-binding protein (19Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, it has been proposed that S1 possesses two RNA-binding sites, one with better affinity for poly-pyrimidines, the others for poly-purines (19Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Draper D.E. Pratt C.W. von Hippel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Draper D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Draper D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The existence of two different RNA-binding sites may result from the fact that S1 consists of six repetitions of a conserved module found in many other proteins involved in RNA metabolism. The first two modules are responsible for the interactions of the protein with the ribosome, whereas the four C-terminal modules interact with mRNA (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This latter region has been proposed to be elongated in shape, with a length of about 200 Å (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) but it fixes short RNA molecules of about 10 nucleotides. Similarly, S1 is able to accelerate the RegB-mediated cleavage of an unstructured decanucleotide (9Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of several structured molecules of about 20 nucleotides (23Lebars I. Hu R.-M. Lallemand J.-Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).Considering the modular organization of S1, the discrepancy between the size of its RNA-binding region and that of several RegB targets, and the possible existence of two RNA-binding sites, we wondered whether all six modules were necessary for RegB activation. To approach this question, we cloned the sequences coding for twelve fragments of the S1 protein: the N-terminal bi-module, the C-terminal tetra-module, and the two three-modules, the three bi-modules, and the four mono-modules contained in the C-terminal region. The ability of all these fragments to enhance RegB cleavage was tested, and the interactions of two of them (the C-terminal tetra-module and the bi-module containing the fourth and fifth domains) with two RNAs were probed by NMR spectroscopy. The results indicate that RegB activation requires the cooperation of different sets of modules depending on the substrate but that all substrates tested interact similarly with either the bi- or the tetra-module, suggesting a common interaction surface. In the case of the tetra-module, the interactions involve the four domains, reopening the question of the spatial organization of this region.DISCUSSIONAs indicated in the introduction, the S1 protein is composed of six repeats of a conserved module of about 80 amino acids organized in a five-stranded β-barrel. The distance between the N and C termini of each module is ∼30 Å (29Bycroft M. Hubbard T.J. Proctor M. Freund S.M. Murzin A.G. Cell. 1997; 88: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar), a value compatible with that deduced for the entire protein (between 230 and 280 Å, with an axial ratio of about 10) from hydrodynamic or x-ray scattering experiments (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast with this large size, the dimension of the RNA-binding site seems rather small. It has been evaluated by different techniques to correspond to unstructured fragments of about 10–12 nucleotides (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,18Boni I.V. Isaeva D.M. Musichenko M.L. Tzareva N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 19Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), with lengths of about 40 Å. The generation by the SELEX method of high affinity RNA ligands to S1 provided molecules consisting of a pseudoknot whose central helix was also formed by 10 nucleotides (33Ringquist S. Jones T. Snyder E.E. Gibson T. Boni I. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 3640-3648Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The S1 protein is able to promote the cleavage of unstructured decanucleotides (e.g. JR10 used in this study). Considering the apparent discrepancy between the size of S1 and that of its RNA targets, we wondered whether all modules were necessary for a given biological activity or whether each has evolved to acquire specialized functions. A first answer to this question is provided by the observation that the first two modules are involved in ribosome binding, whereas the four following are responsible for the mRNA recognition, but the question remains open for the four C-terminal modules. We thus decided to analyze the ability of several fragments of the S1 protein, and in particular of all sub-fragments of the C-terminal region, to promote the RegB cleavage of several short RNAs.The cleavage experiments first confirm that the ability of S1 to enhance the RegB rate is due to the C-terminal region of the protein (F3–6 fragment), but they also suggest that the removal of the N-terminal part alters its properties (as indicated by the comparison of the F3–6 and S1 efficiencies with JR10 as substrate). They also demonstrate that the different C-terminal modules are not equivalent. The F45 fragment is the only bi-module able to accelerate the cleavage reaction (using the Selex molecules), but to a lesser extent than the entire protein. The third module is always required and is sufficient in the case of the Selex substrates to compensate for the difference. The sixth module has no influence on the cleavage of the Selex molecules but is strictly required for JR10. These experiments also show that there is a strong cooperativity between the modules. The fourth and fifth modules are only active when associated in the F45 fragment, as shown by the absence of activity of the F4 and F5 mono-modules and of the F34 and F56 bi-modules. The third module is only active when associated with the fourth and fifth in the F3–5 fragment, as shown by the absence of activity of the F3 and F34 fragments. Finally, the sixth is only active when associated with the three others in the F3–6 fragment, as shown by the absence of activity of the F6 and F56 fragments and by the very weak effect of the F4–6 three-module.A second observation is that the efficiency of the fragments depends on the substrates. The F45 fragment is sufficient to partially activate the cleavage of the Selex molecules but not of JR10. The F3–5 tri-module is sufficient to reproduce the effect of the entire S1 protein on the two Selex molecules, but the complete C-terminal region (F3–6) is required to accelerate the cleavage of JR10. Interestingly, a similar property of the sixth module (indispensable for one activity, dispensable for another) has been recently reported in the initiation of translation (34Boni I.V. Artamonova V.S. Dreyfus M. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5872-5879Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The authors showed that the S1 ssyFmutant codes for a protein lacking the sixth module (the last 92 residues of the protein, more precisely). They also showed that this mutation hardly affects the initiation of translation of the E. coli messenger RNA but abolishes the autorepression of S1 translation. This strongly suggests that the sixth module is indispensable for the down-regulation of the translation of S1 but dispensable for the initiation of translation. A related observation has also been made with the nucleolin protein (35Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 17: 14338-14343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nucleolin consists of four RNA binding domains of about 80 amino acids. It is able to bind two kinds of substrate: RNA fragments containing a short hairpin (NRE for nucleolin recognition elements) or an unstructured stretch of 11 conserved nucleotides (ECM for evolutionary conserved motif). Interestingly, the first two domains of nucleolin are necessary and sufficient for its specific interaction with the NRE hairpin, whereas all four domains are required for the binding of the unstructured ECM.Several hypotheses can account for the above results. First, it was not excluded that some of them result from structural problems induced by the truncation of the protein in fragments (some mono- or bi-modules, for example, may lose their structure). Alternatively, we may speculate that S1 possesses different RNA-binding sub-sites, one recognized by the Selex molecules across the fourth and fifth modules, another binding JR10 and spanning the third and sixth modules. This hypothesis is supported by several studies suggesting the existence of two S1 polynucleotide-binding sites (19Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Draper D.E. Pratt C.W. von Hippel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Draper D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 321-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 22Draper D.E. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 122: 339-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, we may also imagine that both molecules interacts with the F45 fragment but that JR10 needs more contacts (with the third and sixth modules) because its affinity is too low or because its interactions with the F45 fragment alone are insufficient to allow the proper orientation or conformation.The NMR experiments first demonstrated that all fragments are structured and stable and that the modules have conserved their integrity in all of them. In addition, together with the SAXS experiments, they strongly support the existence of a monomer-dimer equilibrium of the F3–6 fragment at pH 6.0. At first sight, this provided an elegant model to explain our results, in particular the strong cooperativity between the third and sixth modules observed in JR10 cleavage. Indeed, even with the hypothesis of a completely extended organization of the fragment, it is possible to bring the third module of one molecule in close vicinity to the sixth of a second in a symmetric dimer. It thus seemed possible to propose that the Selex molecules interact with the fourth and fifth modules either only in the monomer or in both the monomer and the dimer states, whereas the JR10 would bind the third and sixth modules in the dimeric form only. However, the subsequent controls at pH 8.0 indicated that the F36 fragment is always monomeric in cleavage buffer and thus ruled out this model.Actually, the NMR interaction experiments carried out at pH 8.0 show that the two substrates bind both the F45 and F3–6 fragments. In the case of the F45 fragment, the effects induced by the addition of both RNA seem similar. Their intensities, however, are different, suggesting that the ability of the F45 fragment to accelerate the cleavage of Selex26 but not of JR10 could be due to a stronger affinity of the protein for the first substrate. As for the F3–6 protein, most of the effects were observable in the two experiments, with the same bias in their intensities. However, we found at least two effects specific to interactions with Selex26. According to these results, the cleavage activation of the Selex and JR10 substrates obtained with different sets of modules would not result from interactions of the two RNAs with different sub-sites of the protein, but are more likely due to different use of the same interaction area. Interestingly, at the end of their study of nucleolin (35Ginisty H. Amalric F. Bouvet P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 17: 14338-14343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the authors note that they “were unable to detect interactions of [the NRE and EMC] RNA with the same nucleolin molecule.” This suggests that the situation we encountered here (different action of the fragments toward the two families of substrate, but strong similarities between the effects induced by the interaction, suggesting a common interaction surface) may be shared by the two systems.The comparison of the F36 difference map with the HSQC spectra of the F45, F3–5 and F6short proteins clearly shows that the binding of both RNAs on the F3–6 fragment induces modifications not only on the fourth and fifth modules but also on the third and sixth. This was not unexpected in the case of the JR10 substrate but it is more surprising with the Selex26 RNA. Again, this observation raises the problem of S1 spatial organization. First, we have to point out that the technique we used cannot distinguish between direct contact and indirect modification of the protein structure. And, considering the very large number of effects observed, it is unlikely that they all correspond to direct contacts. It is thus very likely that the binding of the substrates to the F3–6 fragment induces structural perturbations of the protein. Under these conditions, it is not impossible that there is no direct interaction between the RNA and the third and/or sixth modules, but merely coupling between the substrate binding and a perturbation of the structure and/or positioning of the two modules. Obviously, with this hypothesis, the fact that the third and sixth modules are necessary for complete activation of the reaction implies that the coupling acts in both directions: i.e.that it is necessary to allow the correct substrates binding. However, this is not the only possibility. A comparison was made between the cryo-electron microscope map of a S1 containing E. coliribosome and an x-ray crystallographic structure of the 30 S sub-unit lacking S1 (36Sengupta J. Agrawal R.K. Frank J. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11991-11996Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The deduced shape of the S1 protein is complex, with a central globular portion and two stretched arms, very different from the tri-axial body proposed in view of the SAXS experiments. In addition, the S1 protein possesses two cysteines, both in the fourth module. One (Cys-349) is exposed in the native protein but is protected in the presence of RNA (8Acharya A.S. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 76: 207-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The other (Cys-292) is protected in the entire protein but is accessible in the M1S1 truncated form of S1 lacking the sixth module (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This suggests a structural relationship between the fourth and the sixth modules. It thus seems possible to imagine that the four C-terminal modules of S1 are actually able to interact simultaneously with short RNA substrates. The bacteriophage T4, like many others, takes advantage of host ribonucleases to mature and degrade its transfer and messenger RNAs (1Mudd E.A. Prentki P. Belin D. Krish H.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3601-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,2Mudd E.A. Carpoussis A.J. Krisch H.M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 873-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, T4 early transcripts are also inactivated by the phage-encoded RegB protein synthesized shortly after infection (3Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Ruckman J. Parma D. Tuerk C. Hall D.H. Gold L. New Biol. 1989; 1: 54-65PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sanson B. Uzan M. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 297: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The RegB protein is a ribonuclease that specifically cleaves in the middle of the tetra-nucleotide GGAG (3Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), with a strong bias toward the GGAG found in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the early messengers (6Sanson B. Hu R.M. Troitskayadagger E. Mathy N. Uzan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, RegB probably also cleaves essential host messengers. Indeed, it exerts a strong bacteriostatic/lethal effect onEscherichia coli cells (7Uzan M. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 342: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). 1F. Saida, M. Uzan, J.-Y. Lallemand, and F. Bontems, submitted for publication.1F. Saida, M. Uzan, J.-Y. Lallemand, and F. Bontems, submitted for publication. However, the in vitro activity of RegB is very low compared with its in vivo efficiency. In this context, of particular interest is the observation that the enzyme activity can be enhanced by a factor of up to 100 by the E. coli 30 S ribosomal subunit (9Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the S1 protein alone is sufficient to achieve the same level of stimulation (9Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Working on the properties of RegB, we wished to analyze how S1 promotes RegB reaction. S1 is the largest E. coli ribosomal protein (for review, see Ref. 10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is found in all Gram-negative and in several Gram-positive bacteria (11Farwell M.A. Roberts M.W. Rabinowitz J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 3375-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). A smaller form has also been described in plant chloroplasts (12Franzetti B. Carol P. Mache R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19075-19081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein plays an essential role in the initiation of translation (13Sorensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). It is, in particular, required for the translation of messengers possessing weak (14Roberts M.W. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2228-2235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or no (15Tzareva N.V. Makhno V.I. Boni I.V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 337: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) Shine-Dalgarno consensus sequence. It is thus likely that it facilitates or even supplements the interactions between the Shine-Dalgarno region of the messenger and the 16 S ribosomal RNA. In addition, S1 is used by several phages. Besides its role in RegB activation, it is one of the four subunits of the replicase of RNA bacteriophages (for review, see Ref. 16van Duin J. Fraenkel-Conrad H. Wagner R. The Virus. Plenum, New York1988: 116-166Google Scholar) and it interacts with the β-protein of phage λ (17Muniyappa K. Mythili E. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1993; 31: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that both its physiological function and its role in the RegB system involve the Shine-Dalgarno region suggests that S1 recognizes a similar signal in both cases. However, the nature of this signal is still an open question. The protein is able to bind poly(A), poly(U), and poly(C) oligonucleotides (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Using a procedure based on UV cross-linking, the S1-binding site on Qβ phage mRNA was shown to contain a poly(U) stretch located upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno GGAG sequence (18Boni I.V. Isaeva D.M. Musichenko M.L. Tzareva N.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), but other results indicate that S1 can also act as a poly(A)-binding protein (19Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, it has been proposed that S1 possesses two RNA-binding sites, one with better affinity for poly-pyrimidines, the others for poly-purines (19Kalapos M.P. Paulus H. Sarkar N. Biochimie (Paris). 1997; 79: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 20Draper D.E. Pratt C.W. von Hippel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The existence of two different RNA-binding sites may result from the fact that S1 consists of six repetitions of a conserved module found in many other proteins involved in RNA metabolism. The first two modules are responsible for the interactions of the protein with the ribosome, whereas the four C-terminal modules interact with mRNA (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This latter region has been proposed to be elongated in shape, with a length of about 200 Å (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) but it fixes short RNA molecules of about 10 nucleotides. Similarly, S1 is able to accelerate the RegB-mediated cleavage of an unstructured decanucleotide (9Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of several structured molecules of about 20 nucleotides (23Lebars I. Hu R.-M. Lallemand J.-Y. Uzan M. Bontems F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13264-13272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Considering the modular organization of S1, the discrepancy between the size of its RNA-binding region and that of several RegB targets, and the possible existence of two RNA-binding sites, we wondered whether all six modules were necessary for"
https://openalex.org/W2011615470,"Eukaryotic mRNA capping enzymes are bifunctional, carrying both RNA triphosphatase (RTPase) and guanylyltransferase (GTase) activities. The Caenorhabditis elegans CEL-1 capping enzyme consists of an N-terminal region with RTPase activity and a C-terminal region that resembles known GTases, However, CEL-1 has not previously been shown to have GTase activity. Cloning of the cel-1 cDNA shows that the full-length protein has 623 amino acids, including an additional 38 residues at the C termini and 12 residues at the N termini not originally predicted from the genomic sequence. Full-length CEL-1 has RTPase and GTase activities, and the cDNA can functionally replace the capping enzyme genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The CEL-1 RTPase domain is related by sequence to protein-tyrosine phosphatases; therefore, mutagenesis of residues predicted to be important for RTPase activity was carried out. CEL-1 uses a mechanism similar to protein-tyrosine phosphatases, except that there was not an absolute requirement for a conserved acidic residue that acts as a proton donor. CEL-1 shows a strong preference for RNA substrates of at least three nucleotides in length. RNA-mediated interference inC. elegans embryos shows that lack of CEL-1 causes development to arrest with a phenotype similar to that seen when RNA polymerase II elongation activity is disrupted. Therefore, capping is essential for gene expression in metazoans.

Therefore, capping is essential for gene expression in metazoans. Most eukaryotic and viral mRNAs are modified at their 5′ end by a “cap” structure that consists of a 7-methylguanosine moiety attached to the 5′ terminus via a 5′-5′ linkage (1Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three sequential enzymatic activities are required to form the “cap 0” structure, m7GpppN.

Next, a GTP::mRNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) catalyzes transfer of GMP from GTP, resulting in a 5′-5′ linkage, GpppNp. These two activities are typically associated and copurify as mRNA capping enzyme. A third protein, RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase, adds a methyl group to the N-7 position of the guanine cap (1Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shuman S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 66: 1-40Crossref Google Scholar).Previously we characterized a putative capping enzyme gene, which we named cel-1, that emerged from the Caenorhabditis elegans genome sequencing project (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The open reading frame (ORF) of this gene originally predicted by the Nematode Sequencing Project was 573 amino acids. The C-terminal 340 amino acids exhibit very strong similarity to yeast and viral GTases. The N-terminal region has significant sequence similarity to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, including the active site consensus motif (I/V)HCXXGXXR(S/T)G (4Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A. Saper M.A. Dixon J.E. Cell. 1996; 87: 361-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 5Fauman E.B. Saper M.A. Trends Biochem.

We proved that the isolated N-terminal region (residues 1–236) of CEL-1 has RTPase activity (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Takagi T Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to demonstrate that the C-terminal region had GTase activity.The ORF used in the earlier study was based on predictions of exons within genomic sequence. Since then the C. elegans Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base has produced several cDNA sequences predicted to encode a longer form of CEL-1 that has additional residues at both the N and C termini. Protein produced from the longer ORF fully substitutes for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GTase and RTPase in vivo. The longer CEL-1 C-terminal domain has GTase activity in vitro. We further characterized the isolated RTPase domain both in vivo and in vitro. We analyzed its catalytic properties, including the effect of RNA chain length on the activity. Mutagenesis confirms a mechanistically conserved role for key residues found in both the RTPase and PTPs. Surprisingly, the CEL-1 RTPase did not require linkage to the GTase for targeting to pre-mRNA in S. cerevisiae. Finally, we used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to demonstrate that CEL-1 is essentialin vivo for development of C. elegans.DISCUSSIONHere we characterize the full-length C. elegans capping enzyme, CEL-1. Based on cDNAs in the EST databases, CEL-1 is a 623-amino acid protein with both RTPase and GTase activities. This matches the size of the enzyme-GMP intermediate detected in C. elegans nuclear extract (Fig. 1). Interestingly, multiple cDNAs for human and Xenopus capping enzymes have been described, possibly produced by alternative splicing of mRNA (31Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M.

Commun. 2000; 268: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These cDNA variants encode an intact N-terminal RTPase domain but have either internal deletions or truncations in the C-terminal GTase domain. As a result, the proteins from these variants would only have RTPase activity. PCR analyses showed that these short forms are expressed, but their physiological function is unknown. To date, no cDNAs corresponding to a shortened capping enzyme have been found in the C. elegans EST data base. CEL-1 was originally predicted to have 573 amino acids. CEL-1-(1–585) has RTPase activity but does not complement a S. cerevisiae GTase mutant ceg1Δ (Fig. 3). Therefore, CEL-1 residues 586–623 are not required for protein stability or proper localization but are essential for GTase activity.The CEL-1 RTPase domain (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was the founding member of a subfamily of PTP-like RNA phosphatases. This subfamily includes the capping enzyme RTPases and RNA tri- and diphosphatases, whose functions are unknown (Fig. 2B). All members contain a nucleophilic cysteine necessary for activity (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S.

On the other hand, mutation of a conserved aspartic acid residue in the RTPases (Asp-76 of CEL-1, Asp-66 of MCE, and Asp-60 of BVP; see Fig.2B) only slightly diminishes activity (Fig. 6; Refs.51Wen Y.

X-ray crystallography of MCE-(1–210) shows that Asp-66 is positioned differently from the essential general acid aspartate loop described for PTPs (52Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Apparently, the RTPase mechanism does not conserve the function of this residue.Both CEL-1-(13–221) and MCE-(1–210) can remove the γ-phosphate from the 5′ end of a dinucleotide (Fig. 7 and data not shown). However, maximal activity is observed on substrates that are three nucleotides or longer (Fig. 8 and data not shown). The S. cerevisiaeRTPase Cet1 is unrelated to PTPs, and its reaction mechanism is different from that of metazoan RTPases (40Lima C.D. Wang L.K. Shuman S. Cell. 1999; 99: 533-543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, Cet1 also acts on dinucleotide and trinucleotide RNAs efficiently (18Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Cho E.-J. Buratowski S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar).3Diphosphate-ended oligonucleotides such as ppApG, ppGpC, and ppGpCpC are active as guanylyl acceptors for mammalian and yeast GTases (68Vankatesan S.

Chem. 1984; 259: 13930-13936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Structural studies on RNA polymerase II suggest that RNA exits polymerase in the vicinity of the CTD (73Cramer P. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D. Science. 2001; 292: 1863-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (955) Google Scholar), where capping enzymes will be bound. Capping occurs around the time mRNAs are about 30 nucleotides in length (74Jove R. Manley J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8513-8521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 75Rasmussen E.B. Lis J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7923-7927Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Therefore, capping enzyme probably recognizes the first few phosphodiester bonds of nascent RNA that emerge from the body of pol II and immediately caps the mRNA.RTPases and GTases are typically linked with each other, either on the same protein (metazoans) or in a complex (yeast). In S. cerevisiae, the interaction between the GTase (Ceg1) and RTPase (Cet1) subunits is essential for cell viability. Cet1 cannot be replaced by the RTPase domains from MCE or CEL-1, presumably because these RTPases cannot interact with Ceg1. It was originally proposed that the primary role of the linkage between GTase and RTPase on a single polypeptide was to guide RTPase to pol II transcription complex (43Cho E.-J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3319-3326Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 64Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5189-5198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, both CEL-1-(13–221) and MCE-(1–210) can support viability when Ceg1 is replaced with MCE-(211–597), S. pombe pce1, or C. albicans Cgt1 (Fig. 4, Aand B). Because we did not detect any tight interaction between these RTPases and GTases (Fig.4C), we conclude that the metazoan RTPase domain can be targeted to pre-mRNA and function without any linkage to GTase. The primary function of the Cet1 interaction with Ceg1 is instead required for the activity of Ceg1 (10Cho E.-J. Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Takase Y. Takagi T. Komarnitsky P.B. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 24: 9307-9316Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Other fungal and metazoan GTases do not require an interaction with RTPase for activity (45Pei Y. Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28075-28082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 46Takagi T. Cho E.-J. Janoo R.T.K. Polodny V. Takase Y. Keogh M.-C. Woo S.-A. Fresco-Cohen L.D. Hoffman C.S. Buratowski S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar).Although we found that the link between RTPase and GTase domains is not absolutely required for the capping enzymes of metazoans or fungi other than S. cerevisiae, this does not mean that the interaction is unimportant. To substitute for Cet1 in vivo, it was necessary to overexpress the isolated metazoan RTPase domain with a strong promoter and a high copy plasmid (Ref. 76Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar and this study). In contrast, a low copy plasmid of the full-length enzyme was sufficient for rescuing a cet1Δ strain (52Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragon A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Transfection experiments showed that MCE-(1–210) is mostly cytoplasmic in mammalian cells (51Wen Y. Yue Z. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12226-12231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This may also be true in S. cerevisiae. Overexpression may be necessary to drive sufficient amounts of RTPase into the nucleus and into proximity with the mRNA 5′ end. Alternatively, RTPases may independently bind pol II or a pol II-associated protein. HIV-1 Tat protein binds to both full-length MCE as well as the isolated GTase and RTPase domains (77Chiu Y.-L. Coronel E. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12959-12966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). There could be a corresponding cellular protein(s) that mediates the association of RTPase domain with the pol II complex or RNA chain. Whatever mechanism is used, isolated RTPase domains function more efficiently in vivo when it is linked to a GTase domain.Finally, we examined the requirement for CEL-1 in vivo using RNA-mediated inactivation of the gene.cel-1(RNAi) embryos arrest development with a phenotype that is characteristic of a broad transcription defect. A similar phenotype is seen upon RNAi knockdown of ama-1 (pol II), ttb-1 (TFIIB), or multiple TAFs (23Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 24Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Blackwell T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30413-30416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 27Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Onecel-1(RNAi) phenotype is strikingly different from effects seen upon depletion of basal initiation factors. In those cases, levels of CTD phosphorylation at both serine 5 and serine 2 were lowered in parallel, often reduced to undetectable levels. For example, in ttb-1(RNAi) embryos, in which basal factor TFIIB is knocked down, both serine 5 and serine 2 phosphorylation are reduced to background (23Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 27Walker A.K. Rothman J.H. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5269-5279Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In cel-1(RNAi) embryos, CTD serine 5 phosphorylation appears to be relatively unaffected, whereas serine 2 phosphorylation is dramatically reduced (Fig. 9B). The only other example of this “uncoupling” of CTD serine 5 and 2 phosphorylation occurred when we depleted either of the P-TEFb components, CDK-9, or cyclin T (23Shim E.Y. Walker A.K. Shi Y. Blackwell T.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2135-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Levels of the CDK-9 kinase appear normal in cel-1(RNAi) embryos, however. Because serine 5 phosphorylation occurs primarily near the promoter, the generally normal levels incel-1(RNAi) embryos suggest that transcription initiation may be close to normal. The markedly decreased levels of serine 2 phosphorylation, a modification linked to elongation phase, suggests that the absence of capping enzyme interrupts the progression of transcription. It will be interesting to determine whether the lack of capping enzyme decreases the efficiency with which P-TEFb or other elongation factors are recruited to transcribed genes. This would be the latest of many connections have recently emerged between transcription elongation and mRNA processing. Most eukaryotic and viral mRNAs are modified at their 5′ end by a “cap” structure that consists of a 7-methylguanosine moiety attached to the 5′ terminus via a 5′-5′ linkage (1Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 135-184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three sequential enzymatic activities are required to form the “cap 0” structure, m7GpppN.

Next, a GTP::mRNA guanylyltransferase (GTase) catalyzes transfer of GMP from GTP, resulting in a 5′-5′ linkage, GpppNp. These two activities are typically associated and copurify as mRNA capping enzyme. A third protein, RNA (guanine-7-)-methyltransferase, adds a methyl group to the N-7 position of the guanine cap (1Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv.

Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The open reading frame (ORF) of this gene originally predicted by the Nematode Sequencing Project was 573 amino acids. The C-terminal 340 amino acids exhibit very strong similarity to yeast and viral GTases. The N-terminal region has significant sequence similarity to the protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) family, including the active site consensus motif (I/V)HCXXGXXR(S/T)G (4Denu J.M. Stuckey J.A.

We proved that the isolated N-terminal region (residues 1–236) of CEL-1 has RTPase activity (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 8Takagi T Taylor G.S. Kusakabe T. Charbonneau H. Buratowski S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9808-9812Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to demonstrate that the C-terminal region had GTase activity. The ORF used in the earlier study was based on predictions of exons within genomic sequence. Since then the C. elegans Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base has produced several cDNA sequences predicted to encode a longer form of CEL-1 that has additional residues at both the N and C termini. Protein produced from the longer ORF fully substitutes for the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GTase and RTPase in vivo. The longer CEL-1 C-terminal domain has GTase activity in vitro. We further characterized the isolated RTPase domain both in vivo and in vitro. We analyzed its catalytic properties, including the effect of RNA chain length on the activity. Mutagenesis confirms a mechanistically conserved role for key residues found in both the RTPase and PTPs. Surprisingly, the CEL-1 RTPase did not require linkage to the GTase for targeting to pre-mRNA in S. cerevisiae. Finally, we used RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) to demonstrate that CEL-1 is essentialin vivo for development of C. elegans. DISCUSSIONHere we characterize the full-length C. elegans capping enzyme, CEL-1. Based on cDNAs in the EST databases, CEL-1 is a 623-amino acid protein with both RTPase and GTase activities. This matches the size of the enzyme-GMP intermediate detected in C. elegans nuclear extract (Fig. 1). Interestingly, multiple cDNAs for human and Xenopus capping enzymes have been described, possibly produced by alternative splicing of mRNA (31Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M.

Commun. 2000; 268: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These cDNA variants encode an intact N-terminal RTPase domain but have either internal deletions or truncations in the C-terminal GTase domain. As a result, the proteins from these variants would only have RTPase activity. PCR analyses showed that these short forms are expressed, but their physiological function is unknown. To date, no cDNAs corresponding to a shortened capping enzyme have been found in the C. elegans EST data base. CEL-1 was originally predicted to have 573 amino acids. CEL-1-(1–585) has RTPase activity but does not complement a S. cerevisiae GTase mutant ceg1Δ (Fig. 3). Therefore, CEL-1 residues 586–623 are not required for protein stability or proper localization but are essential for GTase activity.The CEL-1 RTPase domain (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) was the founding member of a subfamily of PTP-like RNA phosphatases. This subfamily includes the capping enzyme RTPases and RNA tri- and diphosphatases, whose functions are unknown (Fig. 2B). All members contain a nucleophilic cysteine necessary for activity (3Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S.

This characteristic structure is conserved among cellular and most viral gene transcripts, in many cases synthesized by different RNA polymerases (2Furuichi Y. Shatkin A.J. Adv.

By contrast, in yeast species the three reactions for cap synthesis are each catalyzed by a separate enzyme (5Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Nagata S. Mizumoto K. J. Biol.

The TPase domain of metazoan capping enzymes includes a conserved active site motif, (I/V)HCXXGXXR(S/T)G, which is also characteristic of protein tyrosine phosphatases (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F.

TPases of unicellular eukaryotes do not contain the Cys motif and use a different catalytic mechanism (7Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Imajo-Ohmi S. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M. Nakamura A. Gotoh H. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 116-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Shuman S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). GTases of metazoan and unicellular origin share several identifiable motifs characteristic of a nucleotidyltransferase superfamily (13Wang S.P. Deng L. Ho C.K. Shuman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9573-9578Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), including a highly conserved KXDG sequence. This motif, and notably the lysine, is necessary for formation of an enzyme-guanylylate GTase intermediate via phosphoamide linkage of GMP to the ε-amino group of the conserved lysine (2Furuichi Y.

In yeast species loss of any one of the three cap-forming enzymes is lethal (5Shibagaki Y. Itoh N. Yamada H. Nagata S. Mizumoto K. J. Biol.

Despite differences in sequence, structural organization, and TPase catalytic mechanism, mammalian capping enzyme cDNA clones effectively complement growth of yeast deletion strains, demonstrating evolutionary and functional conservation of capping from unicellular to higher eukaryotes (14Yue Z.

For this purpose we used RNA interference (RNAi) inCaenorhabditis elegans (16Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (11908) Google Scholar). Based on sequence comparisons, a C. elegans putative bifunctional capping enzyme gene (cel-1) was identified previously, and the bacterially expressed N-terminal domain was shown to encode functional TPase (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, GTase was not obtained either as a C-terminal domain or bifunctional capping enzyme (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have cloned enzymatically active C. elegans bifunctional capping enzyme containing additional N- and C-terminal sequences. They include a 3′ exon not obtained in the previously reported, presumptive full-length clone but which we found is necessary for TPase, GTase, and RNA capping activity as well as for complementation of yeast deletion strains. Double-stranded (ds) RNA corresponding to capping enzyme fed or injected into C. elegans was shown to induce high penetrance embryonic lethality. Progeny of RNAi-treated animals died early in development, showing characteristics of the RNAi phenotypes of other RNA processing genes (17Piano F. Schetter A.J. Morton D.G. Gunsalus K.C. Reinke V. Kim S.K. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Bio. 2002; 12: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The C. elegans capping enzyme sequence was identified on cosmid C03D6 (Wormpep C03D6.3). ESTs yk798b08, yk786d02, yk784d09, and yk790d02 corresponding to capping enzyme were provided by Dr. Yuji Kohara (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). Reverse transcription-PCR (Invitrogen) was used to isolate a full-length capping enzyme clone with C. elegans total RNA as template and gene-specific 5′ and 3′ primers based on the EST sequences 5′ (5′-GCGCGGATCCATGGCTACACGAGGACCAACACCTGACAAAGCG-3′) and 3′ (5′-GCGCGGATCCAAATGTAGGAGAATGATTATCAGAGTTTTTGTC-3′). A new capping enzyme clone that initiated at the thirteenth amino acid downstream of the first methionine was also obtained using as 5′ primer (5′-GCGGATCCATGGGACTGCCTGATAGATGGCTGCA-3′) and the same 3′ primer. Subclones were generated by PCR from the full-length cDNA. The cDNAs with BamH1 sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced to ensure that no mutations were introduced during subcloning. For protein expression, all C. eleganscapping enzyme constructs generated by PCR were subcloned from pCR 2.1 into the BamH1 site of pET42a (Novagen), in-frame with the N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. Mutagenesis at the enzyme active sites was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and appropriate primers. All mutations were verified by sequencing. For S. cerevisiae complementation, constructs were subcloned into the BamH1 site of yeast shuttle vectors p424 (2μ TRP1) or p414 (CEN TRP1) (18Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Expression of the C. elegans genes in these plasmids is under the control of the constitutive yeast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. All constructs were verified by sequencing. pET42a plasmids containing the different capping enzyme clones were used to express GST fusion proteins in the TNT T7 Quick Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). Products were affinity-purified by binding to GST-agarose beads (Sigma), which were then washed extensively in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol) followed by buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) 3 times before performing enzyme assays with the bound proteins. Soluble His6-tagged full-length human capping enzyme was expressed from pHis (T)-hCAP1a (19Tsukamoto T. Shibagaki Y. Murakoshi T. Suzuki M. Nakamura A. Gotoh H. Mizumoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) as described previously (20Wen Y. Shatkin A.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). T7 polymerase run-off RNA (72-mer) labeled with [γ-32P]GTP (50 μCi, 5000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) was transcribed fromBamH1-linearized pBlueScript SKII+ (Stratagene). The 5′ end-labeled RNA was passed through a Chroma Spin-10 column (BD Biosciences) and incubated with translated, affinity-purified proteins in buffer B. Products were analyzed by polyethyleneimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography (TLC) in 0.8 m acetic acid containing 0.9 m LiCl followed by autoradiography. In vitro translated and affinity-purified proteins bound to beads were incubated in buffer B with [α-32P]GTP (10 μCi, 3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) and 0.10 μg of inorganic pyrophosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Guanylylation of proteins was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. For cap formation T7 polymerase run-off RNA (72-mer), synthesized as above with GTP instead of [γ-32P]GTP, was incubated with the different proteins in GTP-labeling buffer for 30 min at 25 °C. Cap formation was analyzed as described previously (14Yue Z. Maldonado E. Pillutla R. Cho H. Reinberg D. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12898-12903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Haploid S. cerevisiae strains YBS2 [MATa, leu2, lys2,trp1, ceg1::hisG, p360-(CEN, URA, CEG1)] and YBS20 [MATa, trp1, his3, ura3,leu2, ade2, can1,cet1::LEU2, p360-(CEN,TRP,CET1)] (11Changela A.

Trp+ transformants obtained at 30 °C were tested for the ability to grow in the presence of 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA), which selects against cells that retain either the CEG1- orCET1-containing URA3 plasmid (21Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). dsRNA was introduced into C. elegans N2 (Bristol) strain using either “feeding” from bacterial expression (22Timmons L. Court D.L. Fire A. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 263: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar) or injection of dsRNA synthesized in vitro from the Δ clone (see Fig. 2A) as previously described (17Piano F. Schetter A.J. Morton D.G. Gunsalus K.C. Reinke V. Kim S.K. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Bio. 2002; 12: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In preliminary tests, injection of dsRNA was found to be more robust than “feeding” and, therefore, was used for the phenotypic analysis. Time-lapse digital movies were made essentially as previously described (23Piano F. Schetter A.J. Mangone M. Stein L. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1619-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Embryos were dissected out of animals at ∼36 h after injection of dsRNA and mounted on a 2% agarose pad. Time-lapse analyses of early embryos were made using a Leica DMLA microscope with a 40× lens and differential interference contrast optics to record 300 frames at 10-s intervals. Terminal phenotypes were recorded from 18–22-h-old embryos that had been incubated at 25 °C (wild-type embryos hatch after 12 h at this temperature) using a Hamamatsu Orca II camera mounted on a Leica DMRA2 microscope and a 63× lens and differential interference contrast optics. Openlab software (Improvision) was employed for the digital capturing. Previous sequence analyses (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) indicated that C. elegans contains a bifunctional capping enzyme with conserved active sites and other defining motifs and significant sequence similarity to other capping enzymes (Fig.1A). C. elegansTPase expressed in bacteria required for divalent cation-independent enzymatic activity a cysteine present at position 124 in an active site motif. This same mechanism was also demonstrated for mammalian TPase (10Wen Y. Yue Z. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12226-12231Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Changela A. Ho C.K. Martins A. Shuman S. Mondragón A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and is completely different from the metal cofactor-dependent TPase of S. cerevisiae and other unicellular organisms (12Shuman S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the previous studies (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), TPase was obtained as an active, soluble protein inEscherichia coli transformed with the N-terminal domain of the C. elegans capping enzyme clone (cel-1). However, GTase could not be expressed in either bacteria or reticulocyte lysate. Sequence comparisons did not reveal any other putative capping enzymes in C. elegans, but recent EST data from a large scale cDNA project 2Y. Kohara, manuscript in preparation. and from an ovary cDNA library (23Piano F. Schetter A.J. Mangone M. Stein L. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1619-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) suggest that the C. elegans capping enzyme contains additional terminal sequences. These analyses also suggested that Wormpep C03D6.2 is part of cel-1 (C03D6.3). These new, additional sequences could be required for GTase activity. Based on this information, reverse transcription-PCR was used to isolate capping enzyme cDNA clones encoding proteins with extended N and C termini compared with cel-1 (Fig.1B). The previously studied (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) 574-amino acid open reading frame clone (cel-1, referred to here as clone Δ) was extended either at the C terminus by 37 amino acids (+C), at the N terminus by 12 residues (+N), or at both ends (N + C). Also constructed were capping enzyme subclones for TPase expression either with (R + N) or without (R) the N-terminal extension and for GTase with (G + C) or without (G) the thirteenth exon (Fig.2A). Although bacterial expression of these constructs as GST, maltose binding protein, or His6-tagged fusions yielded either insoluble aggregates or very low levels of expression, soluble GST fusion proteins of the predicted sizes were obtained in a coupled in vitro T7 transcription/translation system (Fig. 2B). In vitrosynthesized, affinity-purified GST fusion proteins were tested for TPase activity using a [γ-32P]GTP 5′ end-labeled RNA 72-mer as substrate. As shown by TLC analysis (Fig.3), protein encoded by the Δ clone without extended termini (lane 5), like GST (lane 3) and products made without adding DNA (lane 4), had no detectable TPase activity as compared with release of32Pi by treatment with recombinant human capping enzyme (lane 2) or of 32P from [γ-32P]GTP by calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (lane 1). In contrast to clone Δ, products directed by clones that contained extensions at the N (lane 8) or C termini (lanes 7 and 11) or both ends (lanes 6 and 13) actively liberated32Pi from the RNA substrate. TPase produced from the subclone with the N-terminal extension was active (R + N,lane 9) but was inactive without this additional sequence (R, lane 10). Mutation of the active site cysteine to serine, i.e. C124S in +C (lane 12) and C136S in N+C (lane 15) nearly abolished TPase activity. The expressed products were also tested for guanylyltransferase activity using [α-32P]GTP and assaying the formation of radiolabeled capping intermediate Gp-GTase. Products without the 37-amino acid C-terminal extension were inactive (Fig. 4,lanes 4, 7, 11, and 12). The addition of the new 3′ exon predicted in Wormbase yielded active bifunctional capping enzyme in the presence (lane 5) or absence of the extended N terminus (lane 6). Consistent with a requirement for the added 3′-terminal residues, active GTase was also expressed from subclones with (lane 13) but not without them (lane 12). Mutation of the active site lysine to alanine in the KXDG motif (K311A in clone N + C, lane 8, and K299A in clone +C, lane 9) abolished GTase activity. To verify that the results obtained with separate TPase and GTase also apply to coupled reactions that result in caps, RNA was incubated with [α-32P]GTP and the C-terminally extended products either with (Fig. 5, lane 3) or without the extra N-terminal sequences (lane 5). In both cases the RNA triphosphate 5′ end was converted to GpppG (Fig.5). Cap structures were not formed when the C-terminal extension was missing (lanes 2 and 4). These results provide evidence for C. elegans cDNA clones encoding bifunctional capping enzyme and indicate that capping activity in vitro depends on the presence of the new 3′ exon but not the additional N-terminal sequences. Functional conservation of capping enzymes has been demonstrated previously by growth complementation of yeast deletion strains transformed with mouse or human capping enzyme expression constructs (14Yue Z. Maldonado E. Pillutla R. Cho H. Reinberg D. Shatkin A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12898-12903Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15Saha N. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16553-16562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A plasmid shuffle strategy was used to determine whether C. elegans capping enzyme also could complement haploid S. cerevisiae deletion strains that are missing either GTase (ΔCEG1, Fig. 6) or TPase (ΔCET1). The C. elegans capping enzyme constructs were cloned into plasmids containing S. cerevisiae 2μ TRP1 or CEN TRP1 under transcriptional control of the constitutive yeast glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter. In contrast to the in vitro results, only constructs containing extensions at both termini supported growth of the deletion strains. This same requirement was seen with both single- and multicopy expression constructs (Fig. 6and data not shown). Mutant clone N + C C136S, which encoded essentially inactive TPase (Fig. 3, lane 15), failed to complement ΔCet1 (Fig. 6). However, it did support the growth of ΔCeg1, but to a lesser extent than the wild-type N + C clone, consistent with a weak interaction of CET1 with mammalian GTase (24Ho C.K. Lehman K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4671-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The inactive GTase mutant (N + C K311A) did not complement in the ΔCeg1 strain. It also failed in ΔCet1, in agreement with CEG1 requiring CET1 for allosteric (25Cho E.-J. Rodriguez C.R. Takagi T. Buratowski S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3482-3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and/or stabilizing (26Hausmann S. Ho C.K. Schwer B. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36116-36124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) interactions. The N + C clone contains a potential initiator codon at amino acid 13 in-frame with the putative start codon at position one. The possibility that synthesis of the capping enzyme begins at the downstream ATG in N + C was tested by mutating the methionine codon at position 13 to alanine (N + C M13A). The resulting clone complemented growth in both ΔCEG1 and ΔCET1 strains, indicating that initiation at the first methionine in the N + C construct is sufficient for capping function. The combined findings indicate that C. elegans bifunctional capping enzyme is encoded in 13 exons and contains a total of 623 amino acids. To test if capping enzyme is essential for the viability of a metazoan, dsRNA corresponding to nucleotides 1–1722 (encoding amino acids 1–574) of the worm, bifunctional protein was injected into C. elegans (23Piano F. Schetter A.J. Mangone M. Stein L. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1619-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). TheC. elegans strain used in these experiments showed less than 1% embryonic lethality when treated with dsRNA from more than 350 genes tested as part of a large RNAi project (17Piano F. Schetter A.J. Morton D.G. Gunsalus K.C. Reinke V. Kim S.K. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Bio. 2002; 12: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, when treated with dsRNA from the capping enzyme gene (cel-1), 100% of the embryos failed to hatch (Fig.7). One- or two-cellcel-1(RNAi) embryos contained cytoplasmic granules not usually seen in wild-type embryos. These granules, however, are commonly observed when other genes predicted to function in mRNA processing are tested (17Piano F. Schetter A.J. Morton D.G. Gunsalus K.C. Reinke V. Kim S.K. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Bio. 2002; 12: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Despite the presence of aberrant cytoplasmic granules, other basic cell biological events appeared normal during the first embryonic cell divisions, consistent with the idea that these early stages are not dependent on newly transcribed genes (27Powell-Coffman J.A. Knight J. Wood W.B. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 472-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, analysis of terminal phenotypes showed defects that included embryos with no gut granules (94%,n = 79) but variable levels of differentiation including twitching (a sign of muscle differentiation) and other cell types. Similar results were obtained by feeding dsRNA (data not shown). A C. elegans putative cap methyltransferase clone C25A1.3 (1149 nucleotides) coding for a 383-amino acid protein was also isolated based on sequence alignments and data bank comparisons. Translation products directed by the clone had low enzymatic activity (<1% of recombinant human RNA methyltransferase) and did not complement a yeast ABD1 deletion strain (data not shown).C. elegans treated with duplex RNA corresponding to the putative full-length RNA methyltransferase clone elicited an embryonic lethal phenotype with low penetrance (9%, n = 384). mRNA capping is characteristic of eukaryotic cells. Caps are added to RNA polymerase II nascent transcripts by the sequential action of TPase, GTase, and RNA methyltransferase. These enzymes have been cloned from mammalian, yeast, and other cellular and viral origins, and their study has facilitated insights into extensive biochemical linkages, for example between transcription and RNA processing, including capping, that regulate gene expression (4Shatkin A.J. Manley J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 28Manley J.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 790-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar,29Maniatis T. Reed R. Nature. 2002; 416: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). In yeasts and other unicellular species the three cap-forming reactions are catalyzed by separately encoded proteins, and the corresponding genes are necessary for viability. In multicellular organisms capping occurs by the same series of reactions, but they are carried out by only two proteins, bifunctional capping enzyme with TPase and GTase in the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively, and a separately encoded RNA methyltransferase. In addition, metazoan and unicellular TPases use very different catalytic mechanisms. Despite these variations on the basic theme, mammalian capping enzymes complement growth of yeast deletion strains, consistent with evolutionary conservation of a process with important functional consequences at multiple levels of gene expression including initiation of transcription, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport, translation, and RNA turnover. RNAi provided an opportunity to test the effects of depleting capping enzyme in a multicellular organism. To assure that the authentic RNA was used, C. elegans capping enzyme clones were isolated, and expressed proteins were analyzed for TPase, GTase, and RNA capping activities. Previously, bacterial expression of the N-terminal portion of a putative bifunctional capping enzyme clone demonstrated that it encoded TPase (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, despite sequence similarities to other capping enzymes, cloning and expression of C. elegans GTase remained elusive. The results reported here provide the explanation, namely that an additional, 13th exon encoding 37 C-terminal amino acids is required. This extension is necessary for enzymatically active GTase expressed either as the bifunctional protein or separately from a 3′ domain subclone. In our studies of the bifunctional protein, active TPase was also obtained with the clone containing the additional 3′ exon, either with or without a 5′ extension that consisted of another ATG followed by 12 additional codons. Although the 5′ domain previously expressed in bacteria yielded active enzyme (8Takagi T. Moore C.R. Diehn F. Buratowski S. Cell. 1997; 89: 867-873Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), TPase made in vitro with this subcloned domain was inactive without the N-terminal extension. Surprisingly, the C-terminal extension was sufficient in the cell-free translated bifunctional protein not only for GTase but also for TPase activity and RNA capping, suggesting that the C-terminal sequences may facilitate overall protein folding into domains that affect both enzymatic activities. Structural studies should help elucidate the functional effects of the 3′ exon sequences. In contrast to the results with the in vitro products, growth complementation of yeast deletion strains was obtained only with expression constructs, either single or multi-copy plasmids, which encoded a 623-amino acid bifunctional protein containing both the N- and C-terminal extensions. The N-terminal sequences may have a role in protein-protein interactions that increases stability and/or promotes capping in the context of the intact cell. RNAi analysis using the full-length product of the capping enzyme gene confirmed and extended initial observations made during a large-scale RNAi project (23Piano F. Schetter A.J. Mangone M. Stein L. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1619-1622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), including the presence of aberrant cytoplasmic granules in one-cell embryos. Recently, a new large-scale project identified a number of additional genes whose RNAi phenotype showed similar granules. Significantly, all the genes in this phenotypic class (phenocluster) whose putative function could be assigned based on sequence analysis were predicted to play a role in RNA processing (17Piano F. Schetter A.J. Morton D.G. Gunsalus K.C. Reinke V. Kim S.K. Kemphues K.J. Curr. Bio. 2002; 12: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that cel-1(RNAi) terminal phenotypes show variable amounts of differentiation but no gut formation (as assayed by birefringent gut granules). These late embryonic phenotypes are reminiscent of developmental mutations in genes that are necessary to pattern the embryo properly (for example, see Kemphues et al. (30Kemphues K.J. Priess J.R. Morton D.G. Cheng N.S. Cell. 1988; 52: 311-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar)). Several non-exclusive hypotheses can account for these findings. For example, the RNAi effect may be variable, or cel-1 may have an indirect effect by altering the stability of some critical developmental genes. Another possibility is that cel-1 is differentially required in different tissues by directly affecting post-transcriptional regulation of specific developmental genes. We do not favor the first hypothesis because we saw a robust RNAi effect (100% of the embryos from mothers treated with cel-1 dsRNA died). Future work will be required to test if any specific connection exists between embryonic patterning and RNA capping in animals. We thank Drs. Y. Kohara for the EST clones, K.

GTPase-activating protein guanine-nucleotide exchange factor glutathione S-transferase nuclear export signal open reading frame protein A RanGTP-binding domain wild-type green fluorescent protein guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site nuclear localization signal thrombin cleavage site GTPases of the Ras superfamily act as molecular switches in a number of cellular processes (5Takai Y. Sasaki T. Matozaki T. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 153-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). The two states of the switch are the GDP- and the GTP-bound forms of the GTPase where the GTP-bound state is the “on”-state based on its interaction with downstream effectors or target proteins. These target proteins represent the molecular links between a given GTPase and the regulated cellular process. The Ras-like GTPase Ran (Gsp1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is an abundant, soluble protein shuttling between the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm with a predominant localization in the nucleoplasm at steady state. Typical for all members of this superfamily, Ran has low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis and guanine-nucleotide exchange activities, which are activated by a specific cytoplasmic GTPase-activating protein (GAP)1 (RanGAP1/Rna1p) and a nuclear guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (RanGEF) (RCC1/Prp20p), respectively. Besides RanGAP1 and RanGEF, several Ran-binding proteins have been identified (6Künzler M. Hurt E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3233-3241PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of most of these proteins is restricted to either the GDP- or the GTP-bound state of the GTPase. The major classes of RanGTP-binding proteins are the RanBP1 homologous proteins, which act as coactivators of RanGAP1-mediated GTP hydrolysis on Ran, and the family of nuclear transport receptors or karyopherins. Binding of RanGTP to latter class of proteins is the basis of the essential role of Ran in nucleocytoplasmic transport (6Künzler M. Hurt E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 3233-3241PubMed Google Scholar, 7Komeili A. O'Shea E.K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 341-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 8Macara I.G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

Fusions between wt and mutant GSP1and the DNA-binding domain of E. coli LexA protein were constructed by inserting PCR-generated StuI-PstIGSP1 fragments into the SmaI-PstI sites of the two-hybrid vector pBTM116 (17Bartel P.L. Fields S. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 254: 241-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). For pNOPPATA1L-YRB30 and pGALPATG1L-YRB30 the whole ORF of YRB30 was amplified from genomic DNA as a NcoI-BamHI fragment and inserted into the corresponding sites of pNOPPATA1L (pUN100-NOP1p::ProtA-TEV::ADH1t) (17Bartel P.L.

Recloning of theNOP1p::GFP(S65T)::YRB30::GAL4tfusion gene as a SacI-KpnI fragment from pNOPGFP2L-YRB30 into the corresponding sites of pRS424 or pRS426 yielded analogous plasmids with TRP1 orURA3 marker genes, respectively. pET9d-GST-TEV-YRB30 was generated by replacing aNcoI-SacI fragment containing the MAD2gene from pET9d-GST-TEV-MAD2 (G. Stier, European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) Heidelberg, Germany) with the corresponding fragment from pGALPATG1L-YRB30. For expression of a His6-tagged fusion protein in E. coli the entire YRB30 ORF was ligated as aNcoI-BamHI fragment (see above) into pET9d-His6-TB adjacent to the Thrombin cleavage site (G.

Gerstberger and E. Hurt, manuscript in preparation. To check the correct orientation of the insert a NcoI site was introduced immediately upstream of the 3′-BamHI site. For overexpression studies, YRB30 was expressed under control of the galactose-inducible GAL1-promoter from high copy number vector pRS426GAL1 (18Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5767-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). For this purpose, full-length and truncated YRB30 ORFs were cloned as PCR-generatedSpeI-XhoI fragments. Expression of all proteins was verified by Western blot analysis using the anti-Yrb30p antiserum or commercially available anti-ProtA, anti-GFP, anti-His6, or anti-GST antibodies.

Plasmids for expression of GST, His6-Gsp1wt, His6-Yrb1, His6-Rna1, GST-Yrb1, His6-Xpo1, and GST-Kap95 were described previously (20Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol.

Gerstberger) and His6-Gsp1ΔDE (this study) were derived from pTrcHisA-GSP1(G21V) (22Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) by replacing the NheI-HindIII GSP1(G21V) fragment by analogous PCR-generated fragments coding for Gsp1wt and Gsp1p (1–212). A plasmid for expression of His6-Kap95p inE. coli was constructed by inserting the KAP95ORF as BamHI fragment from pGEX4T3-KAP95 (1–861) (20Enenkel C. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16499-16502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) into the BamHI site of pPROEX1. The YRB30 gene was disrupted by replacing the entire open reading frame of YRB30 with a PCR-generated HIS3-cassette in the diploid strain W303-D. The disruption was verified by PCR, and haploidyrb30::HIS3 strains were obtained by sporulation and tetrad dissection of the heterozygous diploid strain. Mating of haploid disruption strains of opposite mating type led to homozygous diploid disruption strains. A rabbit polyclonal antiserum against Yrb30p was raised against His6-Yrb30p fusion protein expressed in BL21(DE3) cells (23Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6003) Google Scholar) and affinity purified over Talon beads (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Immunization of two rabbits was performed by a commercial antibody service (J. Pineda, Berlin, Germany). For detection of Yrb30p in immunoblots, the resulting antisera were used at a dilution of 1:4000. The two-hybrid screen was performed as described previously (24Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar) but using L40Δgal4 cells for transformation of the bait-plasmids. In vitrointeraction between recombinant proteins was assayed as described previously (25Künzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the pull-down assay from yeast extract a culture from wt strain W303–1A was grown at 30 °C to an A600 of 1.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed using a Fritsch Pulverisette 6 (Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). Endogenous glutathione in the supernatant was removed by gel filtration using G25-fine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Loading of extract with GTPγS was done according to loading of Gsp1p with GTP (25Künzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Purified GST-Yrb30p (∼15 μg) was rebound to 50 μl of GSH-Sepharose in universal buffer (25Künzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) containing 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol and one tablet of Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Roche Diagnostics) per 50 ml, washed, and incubated with ∼800 μg of protein of the corresponding supernatant. After washing the bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, as well as mass spectrometry. Affinity purification of ProtA fusion proteins was performed essentially as described (26Senger B. Simos G. Bischoff F.R. Podtelejnikov A. Mann M. Hurt E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2196-2207Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Assays were described previously (27Deane R. Schafer W. Zimmermann H.P. Mueller L. Görlich D. Prehn S. Ponstingl H. Bischoff F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5087-5096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-Yrb30p or GST-Yrb1p as a control were incubated in universal buffer (25Künzler M. Hurt E.C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with Gsp1pGTP. After washing, the complexes were incubated for 12 min at 4 °C with His6-Rna1p or buffer alone. The released proteins were collected. After washing the bound fraction was eluted by boiling with sample buffer. Human Ran loaded with GTP and Rna1p from Schizosaccharomyces pombe were kindly provided by R. Bischoff (Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). Classical and confocal fluorescence microscopy of living cells expressing GFP(S65T) fusion proteins was done as described previously (28Hellmuth K. Lau D.M. Bischoff F.R. Künzler M. Hurt E. Simos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6374-6386Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE, immunoblot, and preparation of yeast cell extracts were performed according to standard protocols. To identify novel yeast Ran-binding proteins a two-hybrid screen was performed using both wt (40 million of interactions tested) and two dominant mutant forms (G21V and T26N; 29 million or 46 million of interactions tested, respectively) of yeast Ran, Gsp1p. These mutant forms are locked in the GTP-bound and the GDP-bound state, respectively (29Lounsbury K.M. Richards S.A. Carey K.L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32834-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Among the preys identified, we pulled out a number of already known Ran-binding proteins, such as members of the karyopherin family, the yeast homolog of RanBP1 (Yrb1p), and Mog1p (Table II). In addition, we identified a number of candidate novel Ran-binding proteins (Yrbs), most of them in the screen with the wt form of Gsp1p. Comparably few preys were identified with the mutant forms of Gsp1p.Table IIList of identified two-hybrid preysBaitPreyNumber of clones (number of independent fusions)FunctionGsp1 wtKAP123 (YRB4)2-aAlready known Yrb.1Karyopherin (importin)Gsp1 wtKAP109 (CSE1)2-aAlready known Yrb.1Karyopherin (exportin)Gsp1 wtNUP42 (RIP1)2-bProteins that bind to yeast Ran probably via three-hybrid interactions involving karyopherins.29 (6)NucleoporinGsp1 wtNUP1592-bProteins that bind to yeast Ran probably via three-hybrid interactions involving karyopherins.6 (3)NucleoporinGsp1 wtSLZ12-cORFs selected for further analysis.19 (7)MeiosisGsp1 wtSHE1 (YBL031W)2-cORFs selected for further analysis.2 (1)UnknownGsp1 wtSEC31Cell polarityGsp1 wtFRS24 (1)Protein synthesisGsp1 wtYER139C2-cORFs selected for further analysis.1UnknownGsp1 wtYEL043W2-cORFs selected for further analysis.2 (1)UnknownGsp1 T26NMOG12-aAlready known Yrb.5 (3)Multicopy suppressor of gsp/ts mutationsGsp1 T26NYPL009C2-cORFs selected for further analysis.3 (1)UnknownGsp1 T26NYBR225W2-cORFs selected for further analysis.1UnknownGsp1 G21VYRB12-aAlready known Yrb.10 (3)RanBP1Gsp1 G21VYGL164C (YRB30)2-cORFs selected for further analysis.3 (1)Unknown2-a Already known Yrb.2-b Proteins that bind to yeast Ran probably via three-hybrid interactions involving karyopherins.2-c ORFs selected for further analysis. Open table in a new tab As a first approach to confirm a physical interaction between these candidate Ran-binding proteins and Gsp1p, we fused selected ORFs (see Table II) to a TEV-cleavable ProtA moiety and expressed the fusion proteins under control of the NOP1 or the GAL1 promoter. After affinity purification over IgG-Sepharose we probed the column loads and the TEV eluates with a specific antiserum against Gsp1p. In none of the cases we could detect an enrichment of Gsp1p in the eluate (data not shown). The fact that one of the ORFs, YGL164C (YRB30), was found as the only prey besides Yrb1p in the two-hybrid screen with the G21V mutant, suggested that the protein bound specifically to the GTP-bound form of Gsp1p, which may be underrepresented in our cell lysate because of RanGAP1(Rna1p)-mediated GTP hydrolysis. We hypothesized that a putative Yrb30p-Gsp1pGTP complex would be stabilized in therna1–1 mutant strain, in which GTP hydrolysis is inhibited. We therefore expressed and affinity-purified the ProtA-tagged Yrb30p driven from a galactose-inducible GAL1 promoter from both wild-type and rna1–1 mutant yeast cells. As predicted, we could enrich Gsp1p using ProtA-Yrb30p when purified from therna1–1 background (Fig. 1). In contrast, no Gsp1p could be copurified with ProtA-Yrb30p from the wt strain or with ProtA alone. A similar result was obtained if Yrb30p was expressed from the constitutive NOP1 promoter (data not shown). In an inverse approach, we coexpressed GFP-tagged Yrb30p with ProtA-tagged Gsp1p in its wt form or in its G21V mutant form, respectively, under control of the NOP1 promoter in wt cells. Proteins were purified over ProtA-Sepharose and eluted by TEV cleavage. The eluates were analyzed by immunoblotting using a GFP antiserum. In agreement with the two-hybrid data we detected GFP-Yrb30p coeluting with ProtA-Gsp1(G21V) but not with the wt form of Gsp1p (Fig.1). We conclude that Yrb30, initially found in a two-hybrid screen with Gsp1(G21V), interacts specifically with the GTP-bound form of Gsp1pin vivo. To test whether Yrb30p could bind to Gsp1p directly, we performed pull-down assays using recombinant proteins produced in E. coli. We immobilized GST-Yrb30p, as well as GSTp alone, as a negative control and GST-Yrb1p (yRanBP1) and GST-Kap95p (yImpβ) as positive controls on GSH-Sepharose beads and analyzed binding of His6-tagged Gsp1p, loaded either with GTP or GDP, to these beads. Like the already known RanGTP-binding proteins, Yrb30p showed clear binding of Gsp1pGTP but not of Gsp1pGDP in this assay, which indicates that these proteins interact directly and specifically (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we could demonstrate that Yrb30p binds human Ran with the same specificity (data not shown). As an alternative approach to test the specificity of the interaction between Yrb30p and Gsp1pGTP, we tested whether we could pull down endogenous Gsp1p from a yeast extract using an excess of immobilized GST-Yrb30p. To convert all GTPases in the yeast extract to their GTP-bound state, half of the extract was loaded with GTPγS whereas the other half was mock-treated (see “Experimental Procedures”). Indeed, Yrb30p was able to pull down Gsp1p that was verified by mass-spectrometry but only from the GTPγS-treated extract (Fig.2B), suggesting a high specificity and affinity for Gsp1pGTP. Having established the direct interaction between Yrb30p and Gsp1pGTP we were interested in delimiting the domain of Yrb30p required for binding to Gsp1pGTP. For this purpose we created various N- and C-terminal truncations of GST-Yrb30p and tested them for binding to His6-Gsp1pGTP as outlined above. As shown in Fig. 3A only the N-terminal 127 amino acids of Yrb30p were dispensable for RanGTP binding. Hence, the minimal RBD of Yrb30p comprises residues 128 to 440. This domain is much larger than the RBD of RanBP1 (∼130 residues) and does not show any sequence similarity to the RBDs of RanBP1 or importin β, suggesting a novel motif for RanGTP binding (Fig. 3B, RBD). A BLAST search with the YRB30 coding sequence reveals homologues of Yrb30p in S. pombe(GenBankTM accession numbers CAA90468.2 andCAA21820.3), Ashbya gossypii, 4F. Dietrich, T. Gaffney, and P. Philippsen, personal communication.Neurospora crassa (GenBankTM accession numberCAC04441.1), Candida albicans (Candida data base (genolist.pasteur.fr/ CandidaDB) number CA5261) (Fig.3B), and Candida glabrata (GenBankTMaccession number AAA35271.1). These proteins show sequence identities of 30 to 40% and similarities of 50 to 60% with highly conserved sequence blocks that are spread over the entire sequence and not restricted to the RanGTP-binding domain. It was shown previously (30Vetter I.R. Arndt A. Kutay U. Görlich D. Wittinghofer A. Cell. 1999; 97: 635-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) that importin β and RanBP1 bind to different surfaces on RanGTP thus enabling the formation of ternary complexes. To get an idea about the epitope on RanGTP recognized by Yrb30p, we tested how His6-Kap95p (yeast importin β) and His6-Yrb1p (yRanBP1) would interfere with the in vitro interaction between GST-Yrb30p and His6-Gsp1pGTP. In a first experiment, GST-Yrb30p was bound to GSH-Sepharose beads and incubated with a mixture of His6-Gsp1pGTP and His6-Yrb1p. With increasing concentrations of His6-Yrb1p the amount of His6-Gsp1pGTP bound to GST-Yrb30p was decreasing suggesting that Yrb1p and Yrb30p compete for an overlapping binding site on Gsp1GTP (Fig. 4A). To test whether Yrb30p could build trimeric complexes, like Yrb1p, with karyopherins, we incubated GST-Yrb30p pre-bound GSH-Sepharose with His6-Kap95p and His6-Gsp1p either in its GTP- or GDP-bound form. As shown in Fig. 4B Yrb30p was able to build trimeric complexes with Kap95p and Gsp1pGTP. In contrast to Yrb1p, no trimeric complexes were observed with His6-Gsp1pGDP. In summary, the binding site for Yrb30p on RanGTP appears to overlap with the one for RanBP1 but is distinct from the one for importin β. All RanGTP-binding proteins known so far, including the karyopherins and the RanBP1-related proteins, inhibit RanGEF (RCC1)-mediated GTP-to-GDP exchange on Ran, presumably by competition with RCC1 for binding to RanGTP. Accordingly, GST-Yrb30p also had an inhibitory effect on RCC1-mediated guanine nucleotide exchange (Fig.5A). The dissociation constant of the Yrb30p-Gsp1pGTP complex derived from the concentration of GST-Yrb30p necessary for half-maximal inhibition was 10 nm, which is ∼five times higher than the value for Yrb1p (21Künzler M. Gerstberger T. Stutz F. Bischoff F.R. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4295-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) but still significantly lower than for importin β, suggesting a rather high affinity. Because Yrb30p showed similar binding characteristics like Yrb1p, the coactivator of RanGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis on Ran, we checked whether Yrb30p would show a similar biochemical behavior. RanGAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis on RanGTP was measured as release of32P from Ran loaded with [γ-32P]GTP as described earlier (24Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). Addition of GST-Yrb30p did not coactivate the reaction but acted as an inhibitor like karyopherins (Fig.5B). We were able to confirm this result in pull-down assays where we incubated pre-formed complexes between His6-Gsp1pGTP and GST-Yrb1p or GST-Yrb30p, respectively, with recombinant His6-Rna1p (Fig. 5C). Under the applied conditions, we observed release of Gsp1p only from Yrb1p but not from Yrb30p."

Two recent experimental developments now provide the basis for the direct measurement of differences in thermodynamic parameters of spectroscopically identified reactive intermediate complexes whose kinetic competence has been verified. These developments are 1) the transient-state multiwavelength spectroscopic approach, which can produce resolved component reaction time courses of enzyme reactions (1Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14585-14590Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 2Tally J.F. Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11284-11293Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar); and 2) the Le Chatelier forced equilibrium approach, which produces significant concentrations of reactive transient intermediate complexes in solution under true thermodynamic equilibrium conditions (3Fisher H.F. Maniscalco S.J. Tally J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 4Anderson K.S. Sammons R.D. Leo G.C. Sikorski J.A. Benesi A.J. Johnson K.A.

Here, we report the results of the first set of such thermodynamic measurements on reactive intermediates of the bovine liver l-glutamate dehydrogenase (blGDH)1 reaction. The Experimental System—The stoichiometry of the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction is shown in Equation 1.

Maniscalco S.J. Singh N. Fisher H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29592-29597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ERI (enzyme-NADPH-α-iminoglutarate) is highly blue-shifted, ERC (enzyme-NADPH-α-carbinolamine) is highly red-shifted (1Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14585-14590Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and ERK (enzyme-NADPH-α-ketoglutarate) is slightly blue-shifted. The Le Chatelier Force (Ammonia Dam) Approach to the Study of Reactive Central Complexes—Here, we allow an amino acid dehydrogenase reaction containing high concentrations of the enzyme, the amino acid substrate, NAD(P), and a product, ammonia, to reach the equilibrium shown in Scheme 2, a process which is usually complete in 3–40 min. This application of high concentrations of free reactants from both ends of the chemical reaction tends to drive the reaction toward the center, building up high and readily observable concentrations of the enzyme central complexes. Beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase obtained from Sigma as an ammonium sulfate suspension was dialyzed against three changes of 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 0.05 mMES, and 0.05 m CHES buffer at the required pH and was filtered through Norit A and a 0.45-μm filter. The pH was adjusted with potassium hydroxide and phosphoric acid. The concentration of the enzyme was measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm, ε = 54,400 m−1 cm−1. Potassium phosphate, potassium hydroxide, phosphoric acid, MES, CHES, NADP, and ammonium sulfate were purchased from Sigma.l-glutamic acid was purchased from Calbiochem. All were used without further purification. Spectra were collected in conventional 1-cm quartz cuvettes in a Hewlett-Packard diode-array model 8450A spectrophotometer equipped with magnetic stirring and thermostatted by pelletier devices to provide temperatures accurate to within 0.1 °C. The initial concentrations were [E] = 5–40 μm; [O] = 380 μm; [G] = 45 mm; [N] = 300 mm, in a 0.1 m potassium phosphate, 0.05m MES and 0.05 m CHES buffer adjusted to the appropriate pH. The reference cuvette contained corresponding concentrations of G, O, and N in the same buffer. A spectrum ofE alone at the same concentration as in the experimental solution was also subtracted from that of the experimental solution. Except where otherwise stated, the results reported here were obtained at 20 °C. Each spectrum was resolved into the sum of species-relatable spectroscopic components as previously described (1Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14585-14590Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Possible contributions were considered from the following array of model spectra: free NADPH (R), the enzyme-NADPH complex (ER), the enzyme-NADPH-l-glutamate complex (ERG), and the ERK complex obtained from stable complexes as well as ERI and ERC complexes obtained from the resolution of transient-state absorbanceversus time and wavelength arrays. Application of Cramer's rule to a determinant made up of Beer's law equations using these model spectra and the experimentally observed one permitted a least squares regression solution using Matlab 6 software (1Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14585-14590Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The filtration experiment was carried out by loading an equilibrated solution into a 10-ml syringe equipped with a Swinney adaptor holding a 0.22-μm Millipore filter and expressing various amounts of filtrate. A typical resolution of a spectrum of a forced equilibrium solution into distinct components is shown in Fig.1. 3As a refinement to the spectroscopic resolution procedure described in Ref. 1Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14585-14590Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, we now correct the reaction spectrum for the contribution of the small loss of NADP to form free R and the ERI and ERC complexes. It can be seen that the only R-containing complexes present at measurable concentrations are the highly blue-shiftedERI complex and the highly red-shifted ERC complex. Given the reaction conditions, the presence of freeE is precluded, and the remainder of the enzyme that is unaccounted for must be a mixture of HEOG andEOG′ forms. This qualitative pattern of complexes is observed throughout the observed pH range. The results of a series of such resolved spectra over the pH range of 6.0–9.5 are shown by the data points in Fig. 2.Figure 2The pH dependence of resolved reactive intermediate complexes. The open triangles (▵) show the relative concentrations of the ERI complex. Each point represents the average of 3–20 experimental values. The open squares (■) represent the relative concentrations of the ERC complex. All concentrations are expressed as fractions of the total enzyme [E T]. The solid lines represent the best overall fit of the data to Equation 1. The vertical lines through each symbol show the estimated probable error. [E T] varied from 5–40 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Evidence that the Le Chatelier forced systems we have used in this work are at (or at least very close to) true thermodynamic equilibrium is provided by the following experimental observations: 1) The equilibrium constant for the O + Ḡ ⇌ R + N̄ + K + H̄can be expressed as K eq = [R]2[N̄] [H̄ +]/(([O] − [RT]) [Ḡ]) for a reaction started with O, G, and N and an amount of enzyme too low to permit the absorption of enzyme complexes to contribute to the observed signal. The components indicated by the superbar are considered to be “buffered”; that is, their concentrations remain constant throughout the reaction. The value of the equilibrium constant was measured over a range of very low enzyme concentrations. The observed pH-dependent value of 5.3 × 10−14m2 obtained at 20 °C agrees very well with that of 7.3 × 10−14m2 reported by Subramanian (6Subrananian S. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 7: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for the same reaction run at 25 °C, corrected for the ΔH0 of 17 kcal/mol−1 reported in the same study. Fig.3 shows the values of ΔG0calculated from K eq values from the same reaction at high enzyme concentration and varying pH using values of [R]free obtained from the spectral component analysis. The variations from the theoretical value (indicated by the arrow in the figure) are not sufficiently large enough to effect our conclusions materially. 2) Addition of small amounts of α-ketoglutarate to a presumably equilibrated reaction mixture rapidly reverses the reaction. 3) Forcing an equilibrated solution through a 0.22-μm filter in a syringe fitted with a Swinney adaptor produced a filtrate containing the essentially same concentration of free NADPH as that calculated by spectroscopic resolution in the original equilibrated solution. 4) Raising or lowering the temperature of a high enzyme equilibrated reaction mixture substantially and reversibly changes both the concentration of free R in accordance with the positive ΔH0 of the chemical reaction and alters the relative concentrations of the ERI and ERC components (data not shown). The reversal of temperature changes from 0 to 35 °C showed only a small hysteresis effect. Given the observations and assumptions described above, the system can now be described by Scheme 3, which can be evaluated by Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7.

Solid bars refer to protonated forms, and open bars refer to their unprotonated counterparts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The results shown in Fig. 5 lead to the potentially important conclusion that both HERI andERI are thermodynamically highly unfavored structures, whereas the unprotonated ERC structure is only slightly less stable than the HEOG and EOG complexes. We now interpret the data of Fig. 2 in the context of Scheme 3. The data show that at pH values at or above 8, 70% of the total enzyme is tied up asERI or ERC complexes under the conditions of the experiment and that throughout the pH range, the concentration of the carbinolamine complex exceeds that of the α-imino complex by at least 6-fold. It is also apparent from Fig. 2 that the pH dependence of both the reactive intermediate complexes observed in this system involves the ionization of a single proton. Because the apparent pKvalues of these complexes differ, it is conceivable that we could be observing the ionization of a different functional group in each case. However, evidence from other studies argues strongly that, to the contrary, we are titrating the same functional group in all three complexes and that the pK app differences reflect differences in the local interactions of that group with the varying chemical bond makeup of each individual complex. Piszkewicz et al. (6Subrananian S. Biophys. Chem. 1978; 7: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) showed that blGDH could be inactivated by pyridoxal or pyridoxal phosphate and that at pH values of less than 10 only one molecule of either reacted rapidly. They also showed that incorporation of the pyridoxyl moiety into the protein involved imine formation with (and only with) lysine 126 of the enzyme. They found an apparent pK = 8.0 for the reaction. Subsequent studies have found this particular residue to be conserved in all the pyridine nucleotide-linked α-amino acid dehydrogenases (7Piszkewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2622-2626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its unmodified presence is an obligatory requirement for catalysis. Assuming then that the marked differences in the pK values observed represent only shifts in the pK of the same residue, it follows that they must be because of corresponding differences in the bonding state of that residue in each of the three different complexes. The reaction shown in Equation 8 results in Equations 9 and 10. EH+K1⇌EH′+K2⇌E′+H+Equation 8 pKobs=−logK1K21+K2Equation 9 pKobs≠pKintEquation 10 The feature shown in Equation 8 occurs repeatedly throughout Scheme 3 on which we have based our interpretation of the observed pH dependences of the EOG, ERI, and ERC complexes and would appear to provide a sound basis for explaining our results. It may also be noted that the apparent pK values defined by the inflection points of the ERI andERC pH dependence curves shown in Fig. 2 do not correspond to any single pK value obtained from our analysis. Thus, such a phenomenological pK value has no real physical significance and represents only the result of the assembly of relationships of the type shown in Equation 8, which occur in a system described by the model shown in Scheme 3. A comparison of both the absolute and relative concentrations of theERI and ERC complexes at equilibrium, shown as dashed horizontal lines, and those in the transient local steady state, shown as solid curved lines in Fig. 6, reveals some striking differences between the compositions of the thermodynamic and kinetic states. At equilibrium, the concentration ofERC is far greater than that of ERI at all pH values. In the transient state, on the other hand, ERI dominates the early burst phase and remains at higher concentrations than ERC throughout the major portion of the reaction time course. The figure shows that at pH 7.6 the transient-state concentration of EOGT is about twice that of its equilibrium concentration. This situation may be expressed in any of three equivalent sets of conceptual terms. 1) In terms of classic chemical kinetics, EOG exhibits some degree of kinetic rather than purely thermodynamic control. 2) In the language of absolute reaction rate (or activated complex) theory, EOG formation is preceded by a low transition state barrier and followed by a relatively high barrier. 3) In steady-state kinetic terms,EOG itself has a low forward commitment factor and must be preceded by a complex having a relatively high commitment factor. The transient local steady-state concentration of the ERI complex is nearly identical to its equilibrium value. Therefore,ERI is 1) under thermodynamic control, 2) lies between low transition barriers, and 3) its forward commitment factor is effectively balanced by those of the preceding and following complexes. The transient local steady-state concentration of the ERC complex is 10-fold lower than its equilibrium value. Therefore, 1) its concentration is dominated by kinetic control, 2) the transition state barrier preceding its formation is higher than that following it, and 3) its forward commitment factor is substantially greater than that of the preceding complex. It can be seen from Fig. 5 that the unprotonated forms of both the imino and carbinolamine complexes are thermodynamically more stable than their corresponding protonated forms at pH ≥ 7.6. Although high reactivity of minor species is always a possibility, the predominance of unprotonated post-hydride transfer species fits in well with the postulated kinetic mechanism (9Maniscalco S.J. Saha S.K. Vicedomine P. Fisher H.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lack of appearance of any of the relatively tight blue-shifted ERK complex from the equilibrium mixture is easily explained by the driving of theERK + N ⇌ ERI far to theERI form because of the presence of the high concentration of ammonium. The absence of any trace of the red-shifted ERG complex is somewhat more difficult to account for. This dead-end inhibitory complex, although slow to form, is so very tight that it constitutes the final complex in the transient-state reaction, and the release of free NADPH from the ERG complex is the rate-limiting step in the steady-state forward reaction. Although the inhibition of the GDH reaction by ammonia is quite complex, we will show elsewhere that the high concentration of ammonia is successful in competing with the α-amino group of l-glutamate at the ammonia binding site of the enzyme, forcing the substrate to bind in a mode in which hydride transfer is precluded. 4S. K. Saha, J. F. Tally, S. J. Maniscalco, S. A. Adediran, and H. F. Fisher, unpublished data. In a previous report on the transient-state resolved component time courses of the Clostridium symbiosum glutamate dehydrogenase (csGDH) reaction, we have demonstrated the occurrence of isomeric forms of ERI, ERC, and ERK complexes (3Fisher H.F. Maniscalco S.J. Tally J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). These isomeric forms differ from the previously identified entities in that their spectral 340-nm peak is unshifted and therefore spectroscopically indistinguishable from that of free NADH. Their existence has been established and their location on the reaction coordinate has been determined by the kinetic competence of this anomalous free R to participate actively in the reaction at several mechanistically separate points. We have ascribed the characteristic of an unshifted spectra to open forms of the enzyme complexes in which the reduced nicotinamide moiety is exposed to a largely aqueous environment, in contrast to the hydrophobic environment of the closed forms. “pH jump” experiments performed on the csGDH transient-state reaction confirmed an obligatory alternation between open and closed forms along the reaction pathway (11Saha S.K. Fisher H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1431: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Had such open unshifted complexes been present in significant concentrations in the equilibrated blGDH solutions we have described here, they would necessarily have led to anomalously high values for the stoichiometric equilibrium constant K eq. No such effect was observed in any of our blGDH experiments. Furthermore, pH jump experiments on blGDH transient-state studies reported elsewhere (4Anderson K.S. Sammons R.D. Leo G.C. Sikorski J.A. Benesi A.J. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1460-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) showed the occurrence of measurable amounts of open forms only in the prehydride transfer phase of the reaction. The lack of appearance of open forms in the equilibrated blGDH solutions reported here suggests that the basis of this aspect of the difference in kinetic behavior of the two GDH species is thermodynamic in nature; the “open⇌ closed” equilibria lie much farther to the right in the blGDH reaction. We have recently shown the presence of a generally conserved active site motif in this class of enzymes (12Fisher H.F. Maniscalco S.J. Bioorg. Chem. 2002; 30: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). It consists of a close-packed atomic tetrad made up of the ε-amino nitrogen atom of lysine 126, an oxygen atom of the carboxylate group of aspartate 168, 5Although residue 168 was assigned as an Asn in the blGDH crystal structure reported by Peterson and Smith (13Peterson P.E. Smith T.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 769-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), it is in fact a highly conserved Asp residue in all other GDH structures. Dr. T. Smith has informed us that the Asn assignment was based on very early amino acid sequence studies (7Piszkewicz D. Landon M. Smith E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 2622-2626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that residue 168 is most probably an Asp. the nitrogen atom of the α-amino group of the substrate, and the oxygen atom of a water molecule hydrogen bonded to lysine 126. Superposition of x-ray crystal structures of different complexes of a variety of these dehydrogenases showed that these tetrads very nearly, but not quite exactly, mapped each other. Although the atom-to-atom center distances around the tetrad averaged about 2.8 Å, they differ individually by as much as 1 Å. Computer modeling of these structures correspondingly predicted a wide variety of hydrogen bonding patterns in this motif. Fig. 5indicates ΔG0 differences between the EOG,ERI, and ERC structures of the order of 1–5 kcal/mol−1. This is about the range of values expected for either the formation of a strong H-bond or the difference between the breaking of one weak bond and the formation of a different strong H-bond. Although still a matter of conjecture, this agreement may not be coincidental. 6A detailed description of the relationships between the geometric pattern of active site residues and the corresponding catalytic and thermodynamic properties in the various complexes identified here will be presented elsewhere. Finally we note that although the thermodynamic characterization of the transient ERI and ERC complexes provided here presents an essential but very elementary step in the full understanding of the structural and chemical nature of these catalytically important entities, the approach whose application we have demonstrated may contribute certain features that could be quite useful in extending studies of enzymatic catalysis to a deeper level of understanding. At the present time, the methods available for determining the structures of enzymes in various complexes (such as x-ray crystallography, neutron diffraction, NMR, IR) all require substantial periods of time for their completion. Their application therefore has been restricted to unreactive complexes. On the other hand, as seen in Fig. 1, the ERC and ERI complexes remain intact for at least one month. Enzyme assays conducted on aliquots of the equilibrated solution show no loss or enzyme activity during that time period. Thus, the Le Chatelier forced equilibrium approach permits the application of such time-requiring methods to the examination of the transient reactive intermediate complexes that constitute the heart of an enzymatic reaction."
