https://openalex.org/W2075216911,"Spectacular advances in superconductors have taken place in the past two years. The upper temperature for superconductivity has risen from 23 K to 122 K, and there is reason to believe that the ascent is still ongoing. The materials causing this excitement are oxides. Those oxides that superconduct at the highest temperatures contain copper-oxygen sheets; however, other elements such as bismuth and thallium play a key role in this new class of superconductors. These superconductors are attracting attention because of the possibility of a wide range of applications and because the science is fascinating. A material that passes an electrical current with virtually no loss is more remarkable when this occurs at 120 K instead of 20 K."

Today the mixing ratio is about 1.7 parts per million by volume, and, having doubled once in the past several hundred years, it will double again in the next 60 years if current rates continue. Carbon isotope ratios in methane up to 350 years in age have been measured with as little as 25 kilograms of polar ice recovered in 4-meter-long ice-core segments. The data show that (i) in situ microbiology or chemistry has not altered the ice-core methane concentrations, and (ii) that the carbon-13 to carbon-12 ratio of atmospheric CH4 in ice from 100 years and 300 years ago was about 2 per mil lower than at present. Atmospheric methane has a rich spectrum of isotopic sources: the ice-core data indicate that anthropogenic burning of the earth's biomass is the principal cause of the recent 13CH4 enrichment, although other factors may also contribute."

https://openalex.org/W1981003305,"Electron microscopic study of the reversible P1 to I1 phase transition in anorthite (transition temperature T(c) = 516 Kelvin) shows that the antiphase boundaries (APBs) with the displacement vector R = 1/2[111] become unstable at T(c), and numerous small APB loops are formed. These interfaces are highly mobile, and their vibration frequency increases strongly with temperature. These observations suggest that close to T(c), breathing-motion-type lattice vibrations of the framework cause the two different configurations around the calcium atoms, which are related by a translation of R approximately 1/2[111], to interchange dynamically through an intermediate I1 configuration. The high-temperature I1 structure is interpreted as a statistical-dynamic average of highly mobile antiphase domains of primitive anorthite."

https://openalex.org/W1974168334,About 60 percent of strontium-90 contained in polished rice in 1960 is due to root absorption from soil. The amount of cesium-137 absorbed by rice plants directly from fallout during the period between ear-shooting and harvest is assumed to be about 20 percent of total cesium-137 in the plant.

Some properties of these substances are reported. CS(2) may be naringenin, but the stronger inhibitor, C(1), has not yet been identified."

dioxide by the management of forests. William Booth's article (News & Comment, 7 Oct., p. 19) treats the planting of trees; the challenge is the management of forests."

https://openalex.org/W2017210845,"The fundamental fact for quantum physics which has emerged from experimental investigations in the field is a double duality of wave and particle concepts. The wave theory of light, firmly grounded by the wave explanations of interference and diffraction and by Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of light waves, is now recognized as giving but one aspect of the nature of radiation. The corpusclar aspect of radiation is revealed in the photoelectric effect and in the Compton effect. In these effects Planck’s constant appears as a universal constant which connects the wave and particle modes of description of the same radiation."
