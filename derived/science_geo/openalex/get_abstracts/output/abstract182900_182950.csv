In this study, we demonstrate that NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) plays a major role in transcriptional activation of ARE-driven genes and identify Nrf2-dependent genes by oligonucleotide microarray analysis using primary cortical astrocytes from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice. Nrf2−/−astrocytes had decreased basal NQO1 activity and no induction bytert-butylhydroquinone compared with Nrf2+/+ astrocytes. Similarly, both basal and induced levels of human NQO1-ARE-luciferase expression in Nrf2−/− astrocytes were significantly lower than in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes. Furthermore, human NQO1-ARE-luciferase expression in Nrf2−/−astrocytes was restored by overexpression of Nrf2, whereas ARE activation in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes was completely blocked by dominant-negative Nrf2. In addition, we observed that Nrf2-dependent genes protected primary astrocytes from H2O2- or platelet-activating factor-induced apoptosis. In support of these observations, we identified Nrf2-dependent genes encoding detoxification enzymes, glutathione-related proteins, antioxidant proteins, NADPH-producing enzymes, and anti-inflammatory genes using oligonucleotide microarrays. Proteins within these functional categories are vital to the maintenance and responsiveness of a cell defense system, suggesting that an orchestrated change in gene expression via Nrf2 and the ARE gives a synergistic protective effect against oxidative stress.

The ARE plays an important role in transcriptional activation of downstream genes such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), UDP-glycosyltransferase 1A6, glutamate-cysteine ligase (previously known as γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), thioredoxin reductase-1 (TXNRD1), thioredoxin, and ferritin (2Lee J.-M.

NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that can bind to an NF-E2/AP-1 repeat sequence in the promoter of the ॆ-globin gene (13Moi P. Chan K. Asunis I. Cao A. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9926-9930Google Scholar). Nrf2 has two kinds of binding partners, a cytoplasmic repressor and multiple nuclear binding partners. Itoh et al. (14Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Google Scholar, 15Itoh K. Ishii T. Wakabayashi N. Yamamoto M. Free Radic. Res. 1999; 31: 319-324Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its repressor Keap1 (mouse), released under conditions of oxidative stress, and translocated into the nucleus. This cytoplasmic repressor of Nrf2 was also identified in human and rat (14Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Google Scholar, 16Bloom D. Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2191-2200Google Scholar, 17Dhakshinamoorthy S. Jaiswal A.K. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3906-3917Google Scholar). The suggested binding partners that have been demonstrated to bind with Nrf2 consist of other basic leucine zipper proteins such as small Maf (18Itoh K. Chiba T. Takahashi S. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Katoh Y. Oyake T. Hayashi N. Satoh K. Hatayama I. Yamamoto M. Nabeshima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 313-322Google Scholar, 19Marini M.G.

Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Google Scholar), and cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (22Katoh Y. Itoh K. Yoshida E. Miyagishi M. Fukamizu A. Yamamoto M. Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 857-868Google Scholar). The DNA binding sequence of Nrf2 (5′-TGA(C/G)TCA-3′) (23Motohashi H. Shavit J.A. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2953-2959Google Scholar) is very similar to the ARE core sequence (5′-TGACnnnGC-3′) (1Rushmore T.H. Morton M.R. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11632-11639Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that Nrf2 binds to the ARE sequence, leading to transcriptional activation of downstream genes encoding GSTs (24Chanas S.A. Jiang Q. McMahon M. McWalter G.K.

Masutani H. Yamaguchi Y. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18399-18406Google Scholar). Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that Nrf2 is a critical transcription factor for both basal and induced levels of NQO1 expression in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (2Lee J.-M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Google Scholar, 3Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Google Scholar). In contrast to the clear evidences for a role of Nrf2 in ARE activation, the upstream signaling pathway is controversial. For example, mitogen-activated protein kinase (30Yu R. Lei W. Mandlekar S. Weber M.J. Der C.J. Wu J. Kong A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27545-27552Google Scholar), protein kinase C (31Huang H.C. Nguyen T. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Google Scholar), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (3Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Google Scholar, 32Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Google Scholar, 33Li J. Johnson J.A. Physiol.

Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1147-1156Google Scholar) have been suggested to play an important role in ARE activation. The function of Nrf2 and its downstream proteins has been shown to be important for protection against oxidative stress- or chemical-induced cellular damage in liver (36Chan K. Han X.D. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4611-4616Google Scholar, 37Enomoto A. Itoh K. Nagayoshi E. Haruta J. Kimura T. O'Connor T. Harada T. Yamamoto M. Toxicol. Sci. 2001; 59: 169-177Google Scholar) and lung (38Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Google Scholar) as well as for prevention of cancer formation in the gastrointestinal tract (39Fahey J.W. Haristoy X. Dolan P.M. Kensler T.W. Scholtus I. Stephenson K.K. Talalay P. Lozniewski A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7610-7615Google Scholar, 40Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Google Scholar) and promotion of the wound-healing process (41Braun S. Hanselmann C. Gassmann M.G. auf dem Keller U. Born-Berclaz C. Chan K. Kan Y.W. Werner S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5492-5505Google Scholar). In addition, many chronic neurodegenerative diseases (i.e.Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease) are thought to involve oxidative stress as a component contributing to the progression of the disease. The regulation and cell-specific expression of these genes in cells derived from brain could therefore be important for understanding how to protect neural cells from oxidative stress. One of the Nrf2-dependent ARE-driven genes, NQO1, has been demonstrated to play an important role in protecting cells against oxidative stress (42Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Talalay P. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 231-240Google Scholar, 43Murphy T.H. De Long M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Google Scholar, 44Radjendirane V. Joseph P. Lee Y.H. Kimura S. Klein-Szanto A.J. Gonzalez F.J. Jaiswal A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7382-7389Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of NQO1 and one GST isoenzyme does not protect N18-RE-105 rodent neuroblastoma cells from free radical-mediated toxicity (45Duffy S. So A. Murphy T.H. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 69-77Google Scholar), althoughtert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ) treatment, which up-regulates a battery of ARE-driven genes, protects N18-RE-105 cells from glutamate toxicity (43Murphy T.H. De Long M.J. Coyle J.T. J. Neurochem. 1991; 56: 990-995Google Scholar). These observations imply that the coordinate up-regulation of ARE-driven genes, not one or two genes, is more efficient in protecting cells from oxidative damage. A recent study identified the ARE-driven genes including NQO1 that are responsible for protecting IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis (32Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Google Scholar, 33Li J. Johnson J.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 9: 137-144Google Scholar). Therefore, Nrf2, which mediates transcription of ARE-driven genes, is presumably the driving force behind increasing a cluster of protective genes that play an important role in cellular defense against oxidative stress. In the central nervous system, astrocytes have been shown to express many of these protective ARE-driven genes and ARE-driven human placental alkaline phosphatase in primary cortical neuronal cultures derived from transgenic reporter mice (34Johnson D.A. Andrews G.K. Xu W. Johnson J.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1233-1241Google Scholar). To further understand how Nrf2 contributes to the regulation of ARE-driven genes in astrocytes and how expression of these genes affects the sensitivity of astrocytes to oxidative stress, we compared primary cortical astrocyte cultures derived from Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2−/− mice. Astrocytes were treated with tBHQ to induce nuclear translocation of Nrf2 leading to ARE activation and H2O2 or platelet-activating factor (PAF) (46Hostettler M.E. Knapp P.E. Carlson S.L. Glia. 2002; 38: 228-239Google Scholar) to determine differential sensitivity. To understand how Nrf2-dependent genes are associated with this differential sensitivity, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis. Nrf2 knockout mice were generated by replacing the basic leucine zipper domain with thelacZ reporter construct as described previously (47Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Google Scholar). Nrf2+/− mice were bred with Nrf2+/− mice, and primary cortical astrocyte cultures were prepared individually. Cerebral cortices from newborn pup littermates were removed, placed in ice-cold Hanks' balance salt solution (3 ml/pup; Invitrogen), centrifuged at 300 ×g for 2 min, and digested individually in 0.5 mg/ml trypsin (Invitrogen) in Hanks' balance salt solution at 37 °C for 25 min. Tissues were washed twice with Hanks' balance salt solution and resuspended in minimal essential medium with Earle's salt (Mediatech) containing heat-inactivated (55 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (107) and horse serum (107) (both from Atlanta Biologicals, Inc.). Cell suspensions were sieved through cell strainers (70 ॖm; Falcon) and plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml. The medium was changed after 24 h of initial plating and every 3 days thereafter. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified three-gas incubator (57 O2, 907 N2, and 57 CO2; Forma Scientific, Inc.). The Nrf2 genotype of each culture was determined by a PCR-based method (3′-primer, 5′-GGAATGGAAAATAGCTCCTGCC-3′; 5′-primer, 5′-GCCTGAGAGCTGTAGGCCC-3′; andlacZ primer, 5′-GGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC-3′) from genomic DNA (DNeasy DNA isolation kit, QIAGEN Inc.). Cells were used for experiments between 5 and 10 days in vitro. Typically, >957 of the cells in the cultures (both Nrf2−/−and Nrf2+/+) were astrocytes as determined by immunostaining of the astrocyte-specific marker glial fibrillary acidic protein (1:1000 dilution; Dako Corp.) (data not shown). Astrocytes in 96-well plates were transfected with human NQO1 (hNQO1)-ARE-luciferase (80 ng/well) and cytomegalovirus (CMV)-ॆ-galactosidase reporter constructs (20 ng/well) by the calcium phosphate transfection method as described previously (2Lee J.-M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Google Scholar, 3Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Google Scholar). For overexpression, pEF (control vector), pEF-wild-type Nrf2, and pEF-dominant-negative Nrf2 were transfected together with hNQO1-ARE-luciferase and CMV-ॆ-galactosidase. After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with chemicals for another 24 h, and luciferase and ॆ-galactosidase activities were determined (2Lee J.-M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Google Scholar, 3Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Google Scholar). Reporter gene expression is presented as the ratio of luciferase to ॆ-galactosidase activity (for transfection efficiency correction). Endogenous NQO1 enzymatic activity was determined by a colorimetric method for whole cell extracts (with menadione as a substrate) (48Prochaska H.J. Santamaria A.B. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 169: 328-336Google Scholar) and histochemistry for fixed cultures (LY 83583 as a substrate) (34Johnson D.A. Andrews G.K. Xu W. Johnson J.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1233-1241Google Scholar) as described previously. For glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunit (GCLM) and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC) Western blotting, 50 ॖg of whole cell extracts (2Lee J.-M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Google Scholar, 3Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20011-20016Google Scholar) were used. Representative Western blots are shown in the figures. Total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) levels were measured as described previously (34Johnson D.A. Andrews G.K. Xu W. Johnson J.A. J. Neurochem. 2002; 81: 1233-1241Google Scholar). Cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt assay (Promega), and apoptotic cell death was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Primary astrocytes in 96-well plates were pretreated with vehicle (0.017 Me2SO) or tBHQ (50 ॖm). After 48 h, cells were treated with H2O2 (0–300 ॖm, 4 h) or PAF (0–50 ॖm, 24 h). For PAF treatment, the medium was changed with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The media were changed with fresh media, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5–3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)tetrazolium salt substrate was added. After a 2-h incubation, the absorbance at 490 nm was measured. Percent cell viability was calculated byA490(treatment)/A490(control)× 1007. For TUNEL staining, astrocytes in eight-chamber slides were pretreated (0.017 Me2SO or 50 ॖm tBHQ, 48 h), treated (phosphate-buffered saline; 150 ॖmH2O2, 4 h; or 20 ॖm PAF, 24 h), and stained according to the manufacturer's protocol. Nrf2−/− and Nrf2+/+ primary astrocytes were treated with vehicle (0.017 Me2SO) or tBHQ (50 ॖm) for 24 h. Biotinylated cRNA was prepared from total RNA, and fragmented cRNA was hybridized to MG U74 Av2 arrays (Affymetrix) (32Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Google Scholar, 33Li J. Johnson J.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 9: 137-144Google Scholar). Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 was used to scan and analyze the relative abundance of each gene (scaling target signal 2500 and default analysis parameters). Data were analyzed by rank analysis as previously described (32Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Google Scholar, 33Li J. Johnson J.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 9: 137-144Google Scholar). Briefly, the definition of increase, decrease, or no change of expression for individual genes was based on ranking the difference call from two intergroup comparisons (2 × 2 matrix),viz. no change = 0, marginal increase = 1, marginal decrease = −1, increase = 2, and decrease = −2. The final rank reflects the sum of the four values (2 × 2 matrix) corresponding to the difference calls. The cutoff values for increase/decrease were set as +4/−4 (2 × 2 matrix). The reproducibility of paired comparisons was based on the coefficient of variation (S.D./mean) for the fold change of the ranked genes. A distribution curve of the coefficient of variation (CV) was used to determine its cutoff value. The cutoff values were CV < 1.0 and ≥1.2-fold for increased genes and CV > −1.0 and ≤−1.2-fold for decreased genes. This method of analysis is critical in generating an accurate list of genes associated with Nrf2 and tBHQ treatment. Because these littermate cultures were derived from mice of mixed background, there is the possibility that some changes in expression may be associated with differences in genetic background. However, this type of matrix analysis selects for consistent reproducible changes associated with the presence of Nrf2 and tBHQ treatment in lieu of random changes due to genetic background (32Li J. Lee J.-M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Google Scholar,33Li J. Johnson J.A. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 9: 137-144Google Scholar). Gene categorization was based on the NetAffx Database. 2Available at www.NetAffx.com. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and cDNA was synthesized (reverse transcription system, Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Aliquots of cDNA were used for PCR amplification using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega). PCR primers specific to each gene are as follows: NQO1, 5′-CATTCTGAAAGGCTGGTTTGA-3 and 5′-CTAGCTTTGATCTGGTTGTCAG-3′; GST Mu1, 5′-CTCCCGACTTTGACAGAAGC-3′ and 5′-CAGGAAGTCCCTCAGGTTTG-3′; GST A4, 5′-GCCAAGTACCCTTGGTTGAA-3′ and 5′-CAATCCTGACCACCTCAACA-3′; UDP-glycosyltransferase 1A6, 5′-TAGTGCTTTGGGCCTCAGTT-3′ and 5′-CCAAGCATGTGTTCCAGAGA-3′; GCLM, 5′-ACCTGGCCTCCTGCTGTGTG-3′ and 5′-GGTCGGTGAGCTGTGGGTGT-3′; GCLC, 5′-ACAAGCACCCCCGCTTCGGT-3′ and 5′-CTCCAGGCCTCTCTCCTCCC-3′; TXNRD1, 5′-GGGAGAAAAAGGTCGTCTA-3′ and 5′-ACATTGGTCTGCTCTTCATC-3′; HO-1, 5′-TACACATCCAAGCCGAGAAT-3′ and 5′-GTTCCTCTGTCAGCATCACC-3′; protamine-1, 5′-CAGCAAAAGCAGGAGCAG-3′ and 5′-GACAGGTGGCATTGTTCCTT-3′; and ॆ-actin, 5′-AGAGCATAGCCCTCGTAGAT-3′ and 5′-CCCAGAGCAAGAGAGGTATC-3′. Initially, to choose an ARE activator for this study, we tested several known ARE activators in other cell types such as tBHQ in IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells (2Lee J.-M. Moehlenkamp J.D. Hanson J.M. Johnson J.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 286-292Google Scholar, 3Lee J.-M. Hanson J.M. Chu W.A. Johnson J.A. J. Biol.

A. 2000; 97: 12475-12480Google Scholar). Nrf2−/− and Nrf2+/+ astrocytes were transfected with hNQO1-ARE-luciferase and treated with vehicle, tBHQ, H2O2, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. First, the basal level of hNQO1-ARE-luciferase expression in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (3086.5 ± 320.7) (V in Fig. 1B) was significantly higher than in Nrf2−/− astrocytes (657 ± 91.6) (V in Fig. 1A). Second, none of the tested chemicals activated the ARE in Nrf2−/− astrocytes (Fig.2A). Third, only tBHQ increased reporter gene expression in Nrf2+/+astrocytes (Fig. 2B), suggesting that a tBHQ-specific signaling pathway mediates Nrf2-dependent ARE activation in primary astrocytes.Figure 2Nrf2-dependent AREactivation and NQO1 expression. A, primary astrocytes were transfected with hNQO1-ARE-luciferase (80 ng/well) and CMV-ॆ-galactosidase (20 ng/well). After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with tBHQ (0–20 ॖm) for 24 h. Luciferase and galactosidase activities were measured, and ARE-luciferase gene expression was calculated by the ratio of luciferase to galactosidase activity. Each data barrepresents the mean ± S.E. (n = 6). B, primary astrocytes were treated with tBHQ (0–50 ॖm) for 72 h, and NQO1 activity was determined from cell lysates. Eachdata bar represents the mean ± S.E. (n= 6). C, primary astrocytes were treated with vehicle (0.017 Me2SO) or tBHQ (50 ॖm) for 72 h, and NQO1 activity was determined by histochemistry using LY 83583 as a substrate. Magnification is ×200.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) hNQO1-ARE-luciferase gene expression and endogenous NQO1 activity were determined in tBHQ-treated Nrf2−/− and Nrf2+/+ astrocytes. In Nrf2−/− astrocytes, basal ARE-luciferase reporter gene expression was markedly decreased, and there was no induction of reporter gene expression by tBHQ compared with Nrf2+/− and Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (Fig. 2A). Similarly, both basal and induced levels of endogenous NQO1 activity in Nrf2−/− astrocytes were significantly lower than in Nrf2+/− and Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (Fig. 2B), implying that Nrf2 plays an important role in both basal and induced ARE-driven gene expression in mouse primary cortical astrocytes. In addition, histochemical detection of NQO1 activity confirmed the Nrf2-dependent NQO1 gene expression. The NQO1 staining of vehicle-treated Nrf2+/+ astrocytes was significantly higher than that of vehicle-treated Nrf2−/− cells (Fig. 2C, upper left panel versus lower left panel), and tBHQ increased NQO1 staining intensity only in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (lower left panel versus lower right panel). To further investigate the role of Nrf2 in ARE activation, we transfected Nrf2−/− astrocytes with an Nrf2 overexpression vector to restore ARE activation and Nrf2+/+ astrocytes with dominant-negative Nrf2 to inhibit ARE activation. Dominant-negative Nrf2 (N-terminally truncated Nrf2) inhibits endogenous Nrf2 function by occupying and limiting its binding partners and DNA-binding sites (5Alam J. Wicks C. Stewart D. Gong P. Touchard C. Otterbein S. Choi A.M. Burow M.E. Tou J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27694-27702Google Scholar). Indeed, overexpression of Nrf2 led to dramatic ARE activation in Nrf2−/− astrocytes (Fig.3A). tBHQ did not activate the ARE in pEF-transfected Nrf2−/− astrocytes. However, tBHQ did activate the ARE in Nrf2-overexpressing Nrf2−/− astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Finally, dominant-negative Nrf2 blocked both basal and induced ARE activation by tBHQ in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (Fig. 3B). Nrf2 regulates ARE-driven genes involved in detoxification and antioxidant potential. Therefore, we hypothesized that Nrf2−/− astrocytes would be more sensitive to oxidative stress compared with Nrf2+/+astrocytes due to reduced levels of detoxification and antioxidant potential. To investigate this differential sensitivity, we pretreated Nrf2−/− and Nrf2+/+ astrocytes with tBHQ (50 ॖm, 48 h) to increase ARE-driven gene expression and then with H2O2 to investigate differential sensitivity. Also, we used the potent inflammatory agent PAF (46Hostettler M.E. Knapp P.E. Carlson S.L. Glia. 2002; 38: 228-239Google Scholar) to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of Nrf2. As shown in Fig. 4A, vehicle-pretreated Nrf2−/− astrocytes were more sensitive to H2O2-induced cytotoxicity compared with vehicle-pretreated Nrf2+/+ astrocytes. Furthermore, tBHQ pretreatment significantly increased cell viability in Nrf2+/+ (but not Nrf2−/−) astrocytes (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Nrf2−/− astrocytes were more sensitive to PAF compared with Nrf2+/+ astrocytes, and tBHQ pretreatment protected only Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (Fig.4B). TUNEL staining and the corresponding phase-contrast microscope pictures confirmed this differential sensitivity. As shown in Fig. 4C, the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in H2O2- or PAF-treated Nrf2−/− astrocytes were greater than in the corresponding Nrf2+/+ astrocytes. Although tBHQ did not decrease the number of TUNEL-positive cells in Nrf2−/− astrocytes, tBHQ pretreatment decreased TUNEL-positive cells in both H2O2- and PAF-treated Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (data not shown). Consistent with the TUNEL data, H2O2 and PAF induced more caspase-3 activation in Nrf2−/−astrocytes than in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (data not shown). These observations suggest that Nrf2−/−astrocytes are more sensitive to oxidative stress and inflammation compared with Nrf2+/+ astrocytes and that coordinate up-regulation of ARE-driven genes by tBHQ further protects Nrf2+/+ cells from H2O2- and PAF-induced cytotoxicity. To identify the Nrf2-dependent genes that play an important role in protecting astrocytes from H2O2- and PAF-induced apoptosis, we performed oligonucleotide microarray analysis. The genes changed by Nrf2 and/or tBHQ were identified by four comparisons, as depicted in Fig.5A. tBHQ increased 16 genes (stromal cell-derived factor, Induced in fatty liver dystrophy-2, histones 1H2B and H2A,histone H1, TG-interacting factor,Thy-1.2 glycoprotein, Lumican,cysteine- and histidine-rich-1, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-2, proteasome 26 S subunit, and six expressed sequence tags) and decreased 27 genes in Nrf2−/− astrocytes (comparison I in Fig.5A), suggesting that the changes in expression of these genes are Nrf2-independent. Genes changed by Nrf2 in the absence of tBHQ (comparison II) are listed in Table I, and genes changed by tBHQ in the presence (comparison III) or absence (comparison I) of Nrf2 are listed in Table II. Interestingly, the majority of the genes increased by tBHQ in Nrf2+/+ astrocytes (97"
https://openalex.org/W1973948354,"Genetic evidence from mutant mice suggests that α<sub>2</sub>-HS glycoprotein/fetuin-A (Ahsg) is a systemic inhibitor of precipitation of basic calcium phosphate preventing unwanted calcification. Using electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering, we demonstrate that precipitation inhibition by Ahsg is caused by the transient formation of soluble, colloidal spheres, containing Ahsg, calcium, and phosphate. These ""calciprotein particles"" of 30–150 nm in diameter are initially amorphous and soluble but turn progressively more crystalline and insoluble in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion. Solubilization in Ahsg-containing calciprotein particles provides a novel conceptual framework to explain how insoluble calcium precipitates may be transported and removed in the bodies of mammals. Mutational analysis showed that the basic calcium phosphate precipitation inhibition activity resides in the amino-terminal cystatin-like domain D1 of Ahsg. A structure-function analysis of wild type and mutant forms of cystatin-like domains from Ahsg, full-length fetuin-B, histidine-rich glycoprotein, and kininogen demonstrated that Ahsg domain D1 is most efficient in inhibiting basic calcium phosphate precipitation. The computer-modeled domain structures suggest that a dense array of acidic residues on an extended β-sheet of the cystatin-like domain Ahsg-D1 mediates efficient inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2036629661,"Amphetamine (AMPH) elicits its behavioral effects by acting on the dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) to induce DA overflow into the synaptic cleft. Facilitated exchange diffusion is the classical model used to describe AMPH-induced DA efflux. This model hypothesizes that AMPH-induced DA efflux is mediated by DAT and results from the transport of AMPH into the cell followed by a counter movement of DA out to the extracellular compartment. To further characterize the action of AMPH, we used the patch clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration combined with amperometry on human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells stably transfected with the human DAT (DAT cells). In DAT cells, AMPH-induced DAT-mediated currents were blocked by cocaine. We demonstrate that DA efflux mediated by DAT is voltage-dependent, electrogenic, and dependent on intracellular Na(+) concentration in the recording electrode. Intracellular Na(+) fluorescence, as measured by confocal microscopy using a Na(+)-sensitive dye, was enhanced by AMPH application. Furthermore, the ability of AMPH to induce DA efflux was regulated by intracellular Na(+) concentration and correlated with the size of the DAT-mediated, AMPH-induced ion flux across the plasma membrane. In the absence of intracellular Na(+) but the presence of high intracellular Cl(-), AMPH-induced inward currents elicited DA efflux proportionally to their dimension and duration. Thus, we propose that AMPH-induced DA efflux depends on two correlated transporter processes. First, AMPH binds to the DAT and is transported, thereby causing an inward current. Second, because of this AMPH-induced inward current, Na(+) becomes more available intracellularly to the DAT, thereby enhancing DAT-mediated reverse transport of DA."

Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most lethal form of malaria in humans and is responsible for more than 2 million deaths per year. Because of the increasing resistance of this parasite toward the commonly used antimalarial drugs there is an urgent need for the development of a vaccine (1Miller L.H. Baruch D.I. Marsh K.

P. falciparuminvades erythrocytes and develops and expands within this host cell followed by release of invasive merozoite forms into the blood stream. The merozoite is exposed to the host immune system, and proteins involved in the invasion process are potential vaccine candidates. The invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites is a rapid and complex process that relies on an orchestrated cascade of interactions between invading parasite and host cell (3Barnwell J.W. Galinski M.R.

In this report, we demonstrate that EBA-181 binds to the surface of erythrocytes in a sialic acid-dependent manner to a trypsin-resistant/chymotrypsin-sensitive receptor. To evaluate the function of this protein we have disrupted the gene in P. falciparum and analyzed the effect on merozoite invasion.

P. falciparum parasites were cultured in human 0+erythrocytes according to standard procedures (35Trager W. Jansen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). The 3D7 parasite strain was obtained from David Walliker at Edinburgh University. W2mef is derived from the Indochina III/CDC strain. W2mef and 3D7 parasites were transfected as described previously (22Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7289-7294Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Wu Y.

Transfectants were selected with 10 nm WR99210 and where relevant were grown in 4 μm ganciclovir to select against transgenic parasites expressing thymidine kinase. Transfected parasites with integrated plasmids were cloned. Chromosome 1 of P. falciparum was sequenced by the Sanger Centre (www.sanger.ac.uk). Pulse-field gel electrophoresis, preparation of intact chromosomes, and isolation of genomic DNA were performed as described previously (25Rubio J.P. Thompson J.K. Cowman A.F.

DNA sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Southern blotting was carried out using standard procedures. The pHTKΔ181 plasmid vector for disruption of the EBA-181gene was constructed using pHTK (24Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J.

The 5′ (∼1 kb) and 3′ flanks (∼1.2 kb) for homologous recombination into theEBA-181 gene were amplified from genomic DNA of W2mef or 3D7 with the primer pairs 5′- GATCACTAGTATGAAAGGGAAAATGAATATGTG-3′/5′-GATCAGATCTAAGACTCCTATAGGTATAACACTC-3′ (inserts a 5′ SpeI and 3′ BglII site) and 5′-GATCGAATTCTCGGAATCAGGTTTAAATCCAACTGATG-3′/5′-GATCCCATGGTCTAAAACAATTATATGTAGGGTC-3′ (inserts a EcoRI and NcoI site), respectively. Both fragments were inserted into the appropriate restriction sites of pHTK such that they flanked the human dihydrofolate reductase gene, resulting in the vectors pHTKΔ181W2mef and pHTKΔ1813D7. Rabbit and mouse antisera were raised against two domains of the EBA-181 protein using the pGEX system (Amersham Biosciences). One immunogen is located between the F2 domain and the 3′ cysteine-rich region (EBA181ex) and encompasses the amino acids 755–1339 of EBA-181 (Fig. 1). The coding region was amplified from genomic DNA (3D7) using the primers 5′-ACAGGATCCAGTGAGAAAAATGGAGAGGAAG-3′ and 5′-AGCGCTCGAGGTCAAAATCTTTTTCATCTTTTTGTTG-3′ and cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pGEX-4T. The second immunogen (EBA181ct) comprises the cytosolic domain of EBA-181 encompassing amino acids 1510–1568.

EBA181ex, EBA181ct, and EBA-175 rabbit antisera were diluted 1:250, and HSP70 antisera was diluted 1:5000. The secondary antibody was sheep anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Silenus). The immunoblots were developed by chemiluminescence using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on synchronized W2mef, W2mefΔ181c1, and W2mefΔ181c2 parasites. Smears of mature schizonts were air-dried and fixed for 1 min with 100% methanol at −20 °C. Slides were incubated for 1 h with a mixture of rabbit anti-EBA-175 (1:1000) and mouse anti-EBA-181 (1:1250), washed 3 times for 10 min with 0.05% Tween 20, phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated for 1 h with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled sheep anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Silenus Laboratories), rhodamine-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Chemicon), and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:1250, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Dual-color fluorescence images were captured using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope and a digital camera (PCO sensicam).

Bound proteins were eluted from the erythrocyte by incubation with 20 μl of 1.5 m NaCl for 15 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × gfor 5 min. An equal volume of 2× SDS reducing sample buffer was added. In the next step the remaining 225 μl of depleted supernatant was used in a second round of binding with 100 μl of new packed, uninfected erythrocytes. Similar to the first cycle of binding and elution, proteins bound to the erythrocytes were eluted from the erythrocytes, and an aliquot of the further-depleted supernatant was mixed with 2× SDS reducing sample buffer. This procedure was repeated four times. The samples from each step were separated by 6% SDS-PAGE, and parasite proteins were detected by Western blotting. Parasite erythrocyte invasion assays were performed to characterize the invasion phenotype of the W2mefΔ181 transgenic lines (7Reed M.B. Caruana S.R. Batchelor A.H. Thompson J.K. Crabb B.S. Cowman A.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7509-7514Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Surface modification of the erythrocytes was achieved by similar treatment as previously described; 500 μl of packed erythrocytes were incubated with either 50 milliunits of neuraminidase, trypsin (0.1 or 1.5 mg/ml), chymotrypsin (1.5 mg/ml), or a combination of neuraminidase (50 milliunits) and trypsin (0.1 mg/ml), neuraminidase (50 milliunits) and trypsin (1.5 mg/ml), or chymotrypsin (1.5 mg/ml) and trypsin (0.1 mg/ml). Synchronized parasites were treated with neuraminidase and trypsin to prevent re-invasion as follows. Ring stage cultures were adjusted to 2% parasitemia and treated with neuraminidase for 1 h at 37 °C (50 milliunits for 200 μl of packed, infected erythrocytes in 1 ml of RPMI-1640, HEPES, 0.2% NaHCO3). After washing twice with RPMI, HEPES, 0.2% NaHCO3, the infected cells were incubated with trypsin (1 mg/ml in RPMI-1640, HEPES, 0.2% NaHCO3) for 1 h at 37 °C followed by incubation with trypsin inhibitor (1 mg/ml in RPMI-1640, HEPES, 0.2% NaHCO3, Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. The cultures were washed, resuspended in complete medium, and incubated overnight under standard conditions. The invasion assays were prepared the following day by mixing equal amounts of infected double-enzyme-treated cells (schizont stage) with uninfected normal or enzyme-modified erythrocytes to a final hematocrit of 3%. 100-μl aliquots of each culture were put into a 96-well microtiter plates in triplicate. The parasitemia in each well was counted by FACScan using Retic-COUNT (BD Biosciences). After 36 h of incubation, the parasitemia of each well was counted again by FACScan and compared with the starting parasitemia. Control wells with unstained culture and stained uninfected erythrocytes were included in FACScan counting to enable background correction. The EBA-181 gene has been identified from theP. falciparum genome and is composed of 4 exons and 3 introns and spans 5049 bp (Fig. 1, PFA0125c) (29Gardner M.J. Hall N. Fung E. White O. Berriman M.

The exon/intron structure is identical to that described for other members of the ebl family includingEBA-140 and EBA-175 and encodes a putative polypeptide of 1567 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 181 kDa (18Adams J.H. Blair P.L. Kaneko O. Peterson D.S. Trends Parasitol. 2001; 17: 297-299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The predicted protein consists of an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence, two cysteine-rich regions in the extracellular domain (F1/F2 DBL and 3′ Cys-rich domain), a transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. EBA-181 has similarity to EBA-175 and EBA-140, particularly in the F1/F2 domain, with 25.3 and 24.6% identity, respectively. EBA-181 is not as closely related to EBA-175 as is EBA-140, with 37% identity between the latter two proteins within the F1/F2 domain. Nevertheless, EBA-181 is clearly a member of theebl family due to its structural similarity and its sequence identity. The similarity of EBA-181 to EBA-175 and EBA-140 suggests that they may share a similar function with respect to merozoite invasion (Fig. 1). To determine whether EBA-181 is expressed in P. falciparumasexual stages we raised antibodies against a portion of the ectodomain and the cytoplasmic tail of this putative protein (Fig. 1). Synchronized 3D7 parasites were sampled every 8 h throughout the asexual life cycle and analyzed by immunoblots using the anti-EBA181ex antibodies. A major band of ∼190 kDa was observed predominantly in the 24- and 32-h time points (Fig.2A). A second minor band of ∼170 kDa was also detected with the same antibody and may represent a processed product. A protein of the same size and pattern of expression was observed with the anti-EBA181ct antibodies (Fig. 2, Aand B). This confirms the specificity of the anti-EBA181ex and anti-EBA181ct antibodies and the identification of EBA-181 inP. falciparum. Comparison of EBA-181 expression with that of EBA-175 through the asexual blood stage of the life cycle shows that they have identical patterns of expression (Fig. 2C). Analysis of EBA-181 expression in two different P. falciparum lines suggests that this protein can be expressed in different amounts with respect to other proteins. Schizont pellets of 3D7 and W2mef were analyzed by immunoblots using anti-EBA181ex antibodies (Fig. 3). The signal observed for the 190-kDa protein band in 3D7 was significantly higher compared with W2mef with the same antibody. Sequence analysis of theEBA-181 gene in the region to which the antibody was raised showed no differences between 3D7 and W2mef, suggesting that the observed difference in signal was due to expression rather than altered reactivity of the antibodies (data not shown). This was confirmed by analysis of the same schizont samples in both parasite lines with antibodies to EBA-175 and HSP-70. Both of these proteins were expressed at approximately equivalent levels (Fig. 3B). These results suggest that EBA-181 is expressed in 3D7 at significantly higher levels compared with that observed in W2mef. The subcellular localization of EBA-181 was determined by immunofluorescence using anti-EBA181ex rabbit antibodies and compared with EBA-175 by co-localization with anti-EBA-175 mouse antibodies. EBA-175 is localized in the microneme organelles at the apical end of the merozoite (30Sim B. Toyoshima T. Haynes J. Aikawa M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 157-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Anti-EBA-181 antibodies give a punctate pattern in mature schizonts that co-localizes with EBA-175 (Fig.4). Similarly, EBA-181 co-localizes with EBA-175 at the apical end of free merozoites, suggesting that the subcellular localization of EBA-181 is within the micronemes, consistent with it playing a role in merozoite invasion (Fig. 4). EBA-175 and EBA-140 have been shown previously to bind to erythrocytes, and to determine whether EBA-181 also binds we performed assays with normal and enzyme-treated red blood cells (10Mayer D.C. Kaneko O. Hudson-Taylor D.E. Reid M.E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5222-5227Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 11Thompson J.K. Triglia T. Reed M.B. Cowman A.F.

Parasitol. 2002; 119: 159-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Incubation of parasite culture supernatants with untreated erythrocytes showed that EBA-181 binds to these cells and can be eluted from the surface using 0.3 m NaCl (Fig. 5A,first lane). The specificity of EBA-181 binding to erythrocytes was examined by modifying the surface of the red cells. Treatment with neuraminidase, which removes the sialic acid moieties from the cell surface, eliminates binding of EBA-181 to the erythrocytes (Fig. 5A, second lane), showing that the receptor for EBA-181 on the erythrocyte surface contains sialic acid. To further investigate the properties of the EBA-181 receptor, we tested binding to trypsin- and chymotrypsin-treated erythrocytes. The EBA-181 erythrocyte receptor was resistant to 1.5 mg/ml trypsin (Fig.5A, third and fourth lanes); however, it was sensitive to chymotrypsin (Fig. 5A, fifth lane). The properties of the EBA-181 receptor are in contrast to those of glycophorin A, the receptor for EBA-175 (Fig. 5B). EBA-181 interacts with trypsin-treated but not chymotrypsin-treated erythrocytes. EBA-175 binds to chymotrypsin-treated but not trypsin-treated erythrocytes. Therefore, the major EBA-181 receptor is not glycophorin A. These results show that EBA-181 binds to erythrocytes via a sialoglycoprotein that is trypsin-resistant and chymotrypsin-sensitive. The physical properties of EBA-181 binding to its erythrocyte receptor are consistent with the characteristics of glycophorin B. To test if EBA-181 binds to glycophorin B we used S-s-U− erythrocytes that lack detectable levels of this protein (Fig.6), which was verified by immunoblots with anti-glycophorin B antibodies (data not shown). Binding assays of parasite culture supernatants showed detectable levels of EBA-181 eluted from S-s-U− erythrocytes in comparable amounts to that observed with normal erythrocytes (Fig. 6A). EBA-181 binding could be depleted by both S-s-U− and normal erythrocytes after two rounds of incubation with fresh cells, and these results were similar to that observed in identical experiments with EBA-175 (Fig. 6, A and B). The ability to deplete EBA-181 from parasite culture supernatants could be ablated by pretreatment of normal erythrocytes with neuraminidase, confirming the requirement for sialic acid on the erythrocyte surface. These results suggest that EBA-181 binding to the erythrocyte surface does not occur via glycophorin B. The physical properties of the sialoglycoprotein to which EBA-181 binds suggests that it is a novel receptor, and we have termed it receptor E. To analyze the role of EBA-181 in merozoite invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum, we constructed a transfection plasmid to generate parasites that lack expression of this protein. The plasmid pHTKΔ181 was derived from pHTK and constructed such that it would integrate into the EBA-181 gene via double crossover recombination (Fig.7A) (24Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The parasite lines 3D7 and W2mef were transfected with pHTKΔ181, and transfectants were selected with WR99210. Transfected lines were obtained for both 3D7 and W2mef, and these populations maintained the plasmid primarily as episomes, which was shown by hybridization of probes to chromosomes after separation by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (Fig.7B and data not shown). To select parasites that had integrated the plasmid into chromosome 1, where EBA-181resides, the 3D7 transfectants were grown on ganciclovir and WR99210. The resulting parasites were analyzed to determine whether integration had occurred into the EBA-181 gene. The 3D7 parasites transfected with pHTKΔ181 were analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and shown that they maintain the plasmid as an episome even after selection on WR99210 and ganciclovir (data not shown) (24Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This suggested that either the plasmid was not competent for integration or the disruption of EBA-181 in 3D7 was deleterious. Further attempts to obtain 3D7 parasites that had integrated the pHTKΔ181 plasmid or constructs containing different regions of the gene were unsuccessful. We conclude that disruption ofEBA-181 in 3D7 is deleterious. In contrast to 3D7, analysis of W2mef parasites transfected with pHTKΔ181 suggested that the plasmid had rapidly integrated into chromosome 1 without selection on ganciclovir (24Duraisingh M.T. Triglia T. Cowman A.F. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Hybridization of anEBA-181 probe to chromosomes from W2mef transfected with the plasmid revealed a number of bands that do not correspond to chromosomes and is typical of the pattern observed for an episomal-maintained plasmid. This was confirmed by hybridization of thehDHFR probe to the same chromosome blots where the same bands were observed. After a single cycle of drug selection thehDHFR probe hybridized predominantly to chromosome 1, suggesting that the plasmid had integrated. Analysis of parasites after a second cycle of drug selection showed that no episomal plasmid remained, and all parasites appeared to have integrated this region of the plasmid into the smallest chromosome (Fig. 7B). These transfected parasites were cloned to generate W2mefΔ181c1 and W2mefΔ181c2 Southern hybridization with genomic DNA from W2mefΔ181c1 and W2mefΔ181c2 confirmed that the plasmid had integrated into theEBA-181 gene by double crossover recombination (Fig.7C) (24Duraisingh M.T.

The mechanism by which long chain fatty acids (LCFAs) enter cardiac myocytes is not well understood but appears to occur predominantly by protein-mediated transport. Here we report the cloning, expression pattern, and subcellular localization of a novel member of the fatty acid transport protein (FATP) family termed FATP6. FATP6 is principally expressed in the heart where it is the predominant FATP family member. Similar to other FATPs, transient and stable transfection of FATP6 into 293 cells enhanced uptake of LCFAs. FATP6 mRNA was localized to cardiac myocytes by in situ hybridization. Immunofluorescence microscopy of FATP6 in monkey and murine hearts revealed that the protein is exclusively located on the sarcolemma. FATP6 was restricted in its distribution to areas of the plasma membrane juxtaposed with small blood vessels. In these membrane domains FATP6 also colocalizes with another molecule involved in LCFA uptake, CD36. These findings suggest that FATP6 is involved in heart LCFA uptake, in which it may play a role in the pathogenesis of lipid-related cardiac disorders.

Circulation. 1955; 12: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Extraction of fatty acids complexed to albumin by the heart is very efficient, with as much as 70% of the LCFAs1 from the blood entering the myocytes during a single transition through the cardiac capillary system (2Ballard F.B. Danforth W.H. Naegle S. Bing R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1960; 39: 717-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Albumin-bound fatty acids are generated in the heart from triglycerides contained in lipoprotein particles by the action of lipases. Lipoprotein lipase is bound to the luminal face of endothelial cells after secretion from the parenchymal cells of the heart (3Henson L.C. Schotz M.C. Harary I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 487: 212-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Unlike hepatocytes, which have direct contact with the blood, fatty acids in the heart must first traverse the endothelial cell barrier. It is unclear how the LCFAs in the blood are transported across the endothelial cells, but it is unlikely that the entire LCFA-albumin complex leaves the circulation, because albumin does not diffuse through the clefts between cardiac vascular endothelial cells in significant amounts (4Bassingthwaighte J.B. Noodleman L. van der Vusse G. Glatz J.F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1989; 88: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Once in the interstitial fluid between endothelial cells and myocytes, fatty acids are again bound to albumin and rapidly taken up by the muscle cells. Although it was originally believed that uptake of LCFAs into cardiac myocytes is purely mediated by diffusion across the sarcolemma (4Bassingthwaighte J.B. Noodleman L. van der Vusse G. Glatz J.F. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1989; 88: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 5DeGrella R.F. Light R.J. Basic Res.

A fatty acid transport protein (FATP) was identified by expression cloning from a murine adipocyte cDNA library as a protein that facilitates the uptake of LCFAs when overexpressed in adipocytes (9Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). This protein, later renamed FATP1 (10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), is induced during adipocyte differentiationin vitro and is expressed in fat tissue and in the brain, heart, kidneys, and skeletal muscle but not the liver. Subsequently, we reported the discovery of a large family of FATPs characterized by the presence of an FATP signature sequence of 311 amino acids that is highly conserved among FATP family members (10Hirsch D.

FATP expression patterns include proteins exclusively or predominantly expressed in the liver, kidneys, small intestine, or in white adipose tissue (WAT). All FATPs are integral membrane proteins (12Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol.

Metab. 2001; 12: 266-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and detailed subcellular localization studies have been reported for FATP1 and FATP4. The intestinal FATP, FATP4, is localized to the apical side of enterocytes and mediates the uptake of dietary fatty acids (14Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). FATP1 is present in the heart but is also strongly expressed in adipose tissue where its subcellular localization can change on insulin stimulation from an intracellular perinuclear compartment to the plasma membrane (15Stahl A. Evans J.G. Pattel S. Hirsch D. Lodish H.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 477-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The mechanisms and requirements for LCFA uptake through FATPs are poorly understood. Acyl-CoA synthetase activity has been demonstrated for several FATPs (16Choi J.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4671-4683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Coe N. Smith A. Frohnert B. Watkins P. Bernlohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that this activity is required for transport. This notion has been challenged, however, by the recent observation that catalytic and transport activities of the yeast FATP homologue, FAT1, can occur independently (18Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition to FATPs, two other proteins have been implicated in myocardial LCFA uptake: the cytoplasmic heart-specific fatty acid-binding protein and CD36. The strongest support for the role of these proteins comes from data demonstrating that in both heart-specific fatty acid-binding protein (6Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and CD36 (19Coburn C.T. Knapp Jr., F.F. Febbraio M. Beets A.L. Silverstein R.L. Abumrad N.A. J. Biol.

Here we show that a novel member of the FATP family, FATP6, is a functional fatty acid transporter with a heart-specific expression pattern. Further, FATP6 localizes to the sarcolemma of cardiac myocytes juxtaposed with blood vessels where it colocalizes with CD36. This fact suggests that a novel mechanism may exist for the uptake of LCFAs into cardiac myocytes using FATP6, thus potentially implicating the molecule in a broad range of physiological and pathological cardiac functions. Clones encoding human FATP6 were identified by a search of public data bases for sequences similar to murine FATP1–5 coding regions using the BLASTX algorithm (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment containing the entire hsFATP6 coding sequence was inserted into the mammalian expression vectors pMet7 or pIRES-neo (Clontech) for transient and stable transfections, respectively. Transient transfection assays were performed as described previously (10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For stable transfections, cells that had taken up the DNA were selected with 1 mg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). BODIPY-fatty acid uptake assays using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter and 14C-labeled fatty acid uptake assays were performed as described previously (10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 14Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol.

In situhybridizations were performed essentially as described previously (14Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol.

Briefly, paraformaldehyde-fixed dehydrated sections were hybridized with 35S-radiolabeled (5 × 107 cpm/ml) cRNA probes generated from the open reading frame of FATP6. After hybridization, slides were washed and dehydrated. To detect the localization of mRNA transcripts, the slides were dipped in Kodak NBT-2 photoemulsion and exposed for 7 days at 4 °C followed by development with Kodak Dektol developer. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and eosin and photographed. Controls for the in situ hybridization experiments included the use of a sense probe, which showed no signal above background in all cases. Human mRNA blots were obtained from Clontech. Blots were probed with32P-labeled DNA probes generated by PCR from the 5′-untranslated region of FATP6 using the Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences). Unfixed rhesus monkey or mouse heart was washed with Hanks' buffered salt solution containing 1 mm EDTA, infused with 2.3 m sucrose solution, and embedded in O.C.T. 4583 compound. The material was cut into thick sections (15–40 μm). The sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% normal donkey serum to block nonspecific binding. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 1 h. The sections were mounted in 90% glycerol/phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml paraphenylinediamine and examined with a Zeiss LSM10 confocal system. Anti-FATP6 serum was raised by immunization of rabbits with the last 90 C-terminal amino acids fused to GST. Serum was affinity-purified over protein A columns and found to have minimal cross-reactivity against other FATP family members. Monoclonal anti-caveolin 3 antibodies and anti-CD31 were purchased from BD Biosciences. The anti-CD36 monoclonal antibody was a generous gift from Dr. Maria Febbraio. We initially reported the 3′ sequence of a sixth human FATP gene using BLAST screens of FATP1 against the NCBI public data bases (10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Using the known 3′ FATP6 sequence, we screened public data bases of human expressed sequence tags and identified a full-length cDNA for FATP6. The cDNA clone was confirmed by sequencing and was found later to be identical to a cDNA sequence deposited in GenBankTM as VLCS-H1 (AF064254). The FATP6 cDNA encodes for a 619-amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of 70.1 kDa. Alignments of the full-length FATP6 protein with the full-length sequences of all other known human FATPs were done using the ClustalW algorithm. Fig.1 A shows that FATP6 is a member of the FATP family and is most closely related to FATP2 (51.1% identity). FATP6 is part of a larger group including FATP5 and FATP3 that is clearly distinct from the FATP1 and FATP4 genes (Fig. 1). Using radiation hybrid mapping, we localized hsFATP6 to human chromosome 5q23 (D5S1896). hsFATP6 sequence and localization was also confirmed by the human genome project, which showed that the coding region of the gene is distributed over 10 exons spanning 67 kb on chromosome 5q. Using alignments of hsFATP6 against the translated mouse genome, we were able to identify a murine homologue (mmFATP6). The mmFATP6 protein is 78% identical to hsFATP6 and is also encoded in 10 exons spanning 55.6 kb on mouse chromosome 18. An FATP6-specific probe from the 5′-untranslated region of the gene was used to detect its expression pattern using Northern blot analysis of human tissue mRNAs. FATP6 was strongly expressed in heart but was absent from the lung, spleen, brain, rectum, colon, liver, muscle, stomach, ileum, jejunum, and pancreas (Fig. 1 B). Moderate levels of FATP6 (approximately 20–40 times lower than in the heart by densitometric quantification of Northern blot data) were found in the placenta (Fig.1 B), testis, and adrenal glands (data not shown). FATP6 mRNA was present at very low levels in kidney, bladder, and uterus (Fig. 1 B). A tissue Western blot of 12 murine organs revealed that mmFATP6 is predominantly expressed in the heart in this species (Fig. 1 C). Weak mmFATP6 expression was observed in the testis (Fig. 1 C). To identify the cell type that expresses FATP6, in situ hybridizations were performed with human heart sections. A sense probe showed only a very low background signal (Fig.2 A), whereas the corresponding FATP6-specific antisense probe showed a strong signal with silver grain accumulations over cells identified by morphology as cardiac myocytes (Fig. 2 B). To further study the subcellular localization of FATP6, we raised an antiserum against the C-terminal portion of FATP6. Sections of rhesus monkey hearts were co-incubated with anti-FATP6 serum and anti-caveolin 3 antibodies (Fig.3). Caveolin 3 is highly expressed by cardiac myocytes and was used as a plasma membrane marker (21Tang Z. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2255-2261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy showed FATP6 in virtually all cardiac myocytes (Fig. 3, middle panels). Staining was FATP6-specific, because preincubation of the FATP6 and caveolin 3 antisera with the FATP6 fusion protein antigen abolished FATP6 but not caveolin 3 staining (Fig. 3 A). At higher magnifications (Fig. 3,C and D), FATP6 protein was found almost exclusively on the sarcolemma. Unlike the caveolin 3 staining, however, FATP6 was not evenly distributed along the membrane but was concentrated in shorter segments. Myocytes derive most of their LCFA from the interstitial space adjacent to the microcapillaries. To test whether FATP6 was concentrated on sarcolemma sections in the direct vicinity of blood vessels, we costained heart sections with FATP6 and a marker for endothelial cells, CD31 (Fig.4, left panels). FATP6 expression was clearly observed in the areas directly adjacent to the microvasculature, whereas expression was absent in the areas of larger blood vessels (Fig. 4, A and B). This expression pattern was apparent at higher magnifications as shown in Fig.4 C, where a small branch of a blood vessel is surrounded by FATP6 expression on the myocytes above and below the blood vessel. This expression pattern is consistent with a role of FATP6 in the uptake of LCFAs from the interstitial space into cardiac myocytes.Figure 4FATP6 is localized adjacent to blood vessels. Fresh-frozen rhesus monkey heart sections were either stained with anti-CD31 antibodies (left panels) or an FATP6-specific antiserum (middle panels), and an overlay projection is shown in the right panels. The barrepresents 20 μm in A and B and 5 μm in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that FATP6, like the other FATP family members, facilitates the uptake of long chain fatty acids, we transiently transfected COS cells with mammalian expression vectors containing either FATP1, FATP4, or FATP6 into 293 cells (Fig.5 A). Transfected cells were identified by CD2 cotransfection, and uptake of BODIPY-labeled LCFA was determined as described previously (10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 14Stahl A. Hirsch D.J. Gimeno R. Punreddy S. Ge P. Watson N. Kotler M. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 299-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Stable cell lines overexpressing FATP6 were generated by the transfection and selection of 293 cells. Initially, approximately 30 independent FATP6 clones were isolated. However, the cell lines with the highest uptake rates lost the ability to take up fatty acids after a few generations possibly because of fatty acid toxicity. Uptake of 14C-labeled oleate by one of the stable FATP6 cell lines with intermediate uptake rates is shown in Fig. 5 B along with uptake by cells stably expressing FATP1 or the expression construct alone. Fig. 5,A and B, demonstrates that overexpression of FATP6 can indeed increase uptake of LCFAs. We further tested the substrate preference of hsFATP6 in comparison with hsFATP4 and hsFATP1 using stably transfected cell lines (Fig.5 C). Interestingly, FATP6 and FATP1 had a higher preference for palmitate and linoleate compared with FATP4, the major intestinal LCFA transporter (Fig. 5 C). As expected, none of the FATPs tested increased the uptake of fatty acids with chain length shorter than C10 (Fig. 5 C). Because both FATP1 and FATP6 are expressed in the heart, we wanted to compare their overall abundance. To this end, we performed Western blots with equal amounts of WAT and heart lysates from mice next to titrations of known amounts of FATP1 or FATP6 antigen. The blots were probed with FATP1 and FATP6 sera, respectively, and signals were quantitated by densitometry. FATP6 was absent from WAT but was robustly expressed in the heart. FATP1 was more than 10 times more abundant in WAT than in the heart (Fig. 6). After calibrating the Western blot signals to the antigen titrations, we were able to directly compare the FATP1 and FATP6 signals in the heart (Fig. 6 B). FATP1 was expressed at ∼100 pg/ml heart lysate (1 mg/ml total protein), whereas FATP6 was more than 20 times (2139 pg/mg lysate) more abundant (Fig. 6 B), which indicates that FATP6 is the predominant FATP in the heart. Because both FATP6 and CD36 are plasma membrane proteins that have been implicated in the uptake of LCFAs into cardiomyocytes, we wanted to test a possible interaction between these proteins. To this end, we stained sections of mouse hearts with antibodies against FATP6 (red channel), CD36 (green channel), caveolin 3 (blue channel) and a DNA-specific dye (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, pink channel). As in sections of primate hearts, murine FATP6 was present in subregions of the plasma membrane (Fig. 7,A, panel I and B, panel I). Staining of the same sections with an anti-CD36-specific monoclonal serum showed a similar staining pattern (Fig. 7, A,panel II, and B, panel II), with streaks on the sarcolemma and pronounced globular aggregates (Fig. 7,white arrows). In contrast, caveolin 3 was evenly distributed along the plasma membranes of all myocytes (Fig. 7,A, panel III, and B, panel III). The overlay of FATP6 and CD36 signals (Fig. 7, A,panel IV, and B, panel IV) showed that FATP6 was distributed somewhat more broadly along the sarcolemma. Significant colocalization of FATP6 with CD36 was most apparent in the globular aggregates (Fig. 7, white arrows). The overlay of FATP6, CD36, and caveolin staining (Fig. 7, A, panel V, and B, panel V) showed further that all three molecules are present in these membrane specializations (Fig.7, white arrows) as indicated by the appearance of the white areas. These data provide evidence suggesting that members of the FATP family may interact with CD36. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for cardiac myocytes, and changes in fatty acid metabolism have been implicated in cardiac disease. The mechanism by which fatty acids from the interstitial space enter myocytes is not well understood, but it has been proposed that the bulk of this uptake occurs via protein-mediated transport (6Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 7Sorrentino D. Stump D. Potter B.J. Robinson R.B. White R. Kiang C.L. Berk P.D. J.

Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel member of the fatty acid transport protein family, termed FATP6, in humans and mice. Heart muscle expresses other FATP family members, most notably FATP1 as well as FATP6. FATP6 is heart-specific, however, whereas FATP1 is expressed in a variety of other organs including adipocytes, skeletal muscle, and the brain (9Schaffer J.E. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1994; 79: 427-436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar, 10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 2000; 279: E1072-E1079Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further supporting the notion that FATP6 is the predominant cardiac FATP is our finding that the protein is more than 20 times more abundant than FATP1 in mouse heart lysates. The heart also has a very distinct uptake pattern of fatty acids and shows, in contrast with WAT, a preference for palmitate compared with oleate (23Becker W. Bruce A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 325-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this trend is reflected by the LCFA uptake pattern of the FATP6-stable cell line, which is consistent with the idea that a significant part of the cardiac LCFA uptake is mediated by FATP6. Amino acid sequence comparisons of the FATP family show that human FATP6 is most closely related to hsFATP2, a fatty acid transporter predominantly expressed in the liver and kidneys. FATP2 is the homologue of a rat gene previously identified by others as a very long chain acyl-CoA synthase (24Uchiyama A. Aoyama T. Kamijo K. Uchida Y. Kondo N. Orii T. Hashimoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30360-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This notion was subsequently challenged by the finding that FATP2 can function as a fatty acid transporter (10Hirsch D. Stahl A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8625-8629Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). It is unlikely that FATP6 is a peroxisomal very long chain acyl-CoA synthase, because our immunofluorescence studies of FATP6 distribution in cardiac myocytes clearly demonstrated that FATP6 is almost exclusively localized to the plasma membrane of cells. However, the mechanism by which FATPs transport LCFAs across phospholipid bilayers is poorly understood, and long chain as well as very long chain acyl-CoA activities have been demonstrated for several mammalian FATP and yeast FATP (16Choi J.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4671-4683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Coe N. Smith A. Frohnert B. Watkins P. Bernlohr D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36300-36304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility that uptake is coupled to CoA activation of LCFA, either directly by FATPs or by a closely associated long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, cannot be excluded (13Stahl A. Gimeno R.E. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 266-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In this context, it is noteworthy that recent studies of the yeast FATP homologue FAT1 (18Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that specific mutations in FAT1 can distinguish the fatty acid import from the very long chain acyl-CoA synthetase activities. Zou et al. (18Zou Z. DiRusso C.C. Ctrnacta V. Black P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31062-31071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) noted that two mutations (S258A and D508A) greatly diminished long chain and very long chain acyl-CoA synthesizing activity and that these residues are conserved in FAT1 and FATPs 1 through 5. Alignment of murine and human FATP6 sequences with the other family members shows that both residues are also conserved in FATP6 (data not shown), which suggests that these mammalian proteins could also function as LCFA transporters in the absence of catalytic activity. Most importantly, direct measurements of long chain (C16:0) and very long chain (C24:0) acyl-CoA activity of hsFATP6 by Steinberg et al. (25Steinberg S.J. Mihalik S.J. Kim D.G. Cuebas D.A. Watkins P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15605-15608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) showed no activity above background when the protein was overexpressed in COS-2 cells. Combined with the data presented here, this finding demonstrates clearly that acyl-CoA activity is not required for FATP6-mediated LCFA uptake. FATP6 is exclusively targeted to areas of the sarcolemma that are directly juxtaposed to microvasculature. This characteristic of FATP6 contrasts with the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter Glut4, which on translocation to the sarcolemma is evenly distributed on the plasma membrane (26Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. James D.E. Lienhard G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7815-7819Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), and possibly reflects the faster diffusion rate of glucose compared with albumin-bound LCFAs. Although FATP overexpression alone leads to an increase in LCFA uptake, it is likely that in vivo several proteins interact to facilitate efficient uptake of fatty acids in the heart. In addition to FATPs, several other proteins have been implicated in LCFA uptake by cardiac myocytes, most notably CD36 and fatty acid-binding proteins, and it has been suggested that these proteins may interact to facilitate efficient LCFA uptake (13Stahl A. Gimeno R.E. Tartaglia L.A. Lodish H.F. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 266-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate for the first time that FATPs are in close physical proximity to CD36 on the plasma membrane. This fact supports the idea that scavenger receptors may help to sequester LCFAs on the plasma membrane and subsequently pass them on to FATPs for uptake. Changes in heart fatty acid metabolism have been linked to various cardiac disorders, especially cardiac hypertrophy (27Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 36-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and ischemic injury (28Lopaschuk G.D. Belke D.D. Gamble J. Itoi T. Schonekess B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). Although normal hearts use fatty acids as their primary energy source, hearts of patients with cardiac hypertrophy rely on glucose metabolism accompanied by a dramatic decrease in fatty acid oxidation (27Barger P.M. Kelly D.P. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1999; 318: 36-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29van der Vusse G.J. van Bilsen M. Glatz J.F. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 279-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Deletion of the genes involved in fatty acid use in the heart has in fact been shown to cause cardiomyopathy (6Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 30Strauss A.W. Powell C.K. Hale D.E. Anderson M.M. Ahuja A. Brackett J.C. Sims H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10496-10500Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fatty acid use can interfere with recovery from ischemic injury, and agents that block fatty acid oxidation, such as etomoxir and dichloroacetate, improve the recovery of contractile function after ischemic injury in rats (28Lopaschuk G.D. Belke D.D. Gamble J. Itoi T. Schonekess B.O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1213: 263-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A recent study comparing FATP1 expression levels in healthy hearts with hearts from patients with cardiomyopathy found no changes in mRNA levels for this transporter (31Pohl J. Fitscher B.A. Ring A. Ihl-Vahl R. Strasser R.H. Stremmel W. Eur. J. Med. Res. 2000; 5: 438-442PubMed Google Scholar). FATP6 expression was not measured, however. It will be of great interest to determine whether FATP6 is altered during the development of cardiac abnormalities and whether overexpression or inhibition of the transporter can affect cardiac disease.

Although reversible formation of protein-SSG is a prevalent form of protein sulfhydryl modification, mechanisms of protein-SSG formation are not resolved. Unless intracellular GSSG concentrations reach unusually high levels, GSSG is unlikely to be the mediator of protein-SSG formation based on typical redox potentials for cysteine residues (14Ziegler D.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 305-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 15Gilbert H.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 8-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Consequently, glutathione-thiyl radical andS-nitrosoglutathione (GS-NO) have been considered as potential alternative mediators (5Thomas J.A. Poland B. Honzatco R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 6Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 242: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 10Klatt P.

In this context, we considered the unusually low pKa (=3.5) of the active site cysteine of glutaredoxin (16Mieyal J.J. Starke D.W. Gravina S.A. Hocevar B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8883-8891Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Srinivasan U. Mieyal P.A. Mieyal J.J.

Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-19Google Scholar, 19Schoneich C. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease.

Accordingly, we reasoned that glutaredoxin might react preferentially with the glutathione-thiyl radical to form a glutaredoxin-S-S-glutathione-disulfide anion radical (GRx-SSG⨪) and that this enzyme intermediate could facilitate transfer of the GS-radical either to form GSSG or protein-SSG adducts. To test this hypothesis, two GS-radical generating systems were used,i.e. Fe(II)-ADP/H2O2 + GSH (20Floyd R.A. Lewis C.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2645-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Floyd R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 225: 263-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and HRP/H2O2 + GSH (22Harman L.S. Carver D.K. Schreiber J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1642-1648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that glutaredoxin catalyzes the formation of GSSG in the GS-radical generating systems. The catalysis of GSSG formation is dependent on molecular oxygen, and it is distinguished from glutathione peroxidase-like activity. Moreover, glutaredoxin enhanced the rate ofS-glutathionylation of GAPDH in the presence of GS-radicals. This model reaction mimics the intracellular formation of GAPDH-SSG under oxidative conditions where GSSG content is not substantially changed (23Chai Y.C. Hendrich S. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25010-25015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin also enhanced the rate of formation of GAPDH-SSG when GSSG or GS-NO were used as the glutathionyl donors, but these reactions were much less efficient than the GS-radical transfer reaction. In comparison to GAPDH, both actin and PTP1B were found to be superior substrates for GRx-facilitated S-glutathionylation under GS-radical transfer conditions. Both actin and PTP1B are implicated in redox signal transduction, and both have been shown to be susceptible to intracellular regulation via reversible glutathionylation, probably involving glutaredoxin as the deglutathionylation catalyst (9Barrett W.C.

Our current findings further characterize glutaredoxin as a versatile catalyst capable of facilitating S-glutathionylation of redox signal mediators. Water was initially purified by reverse osmosis. It was further purified by a Millipore MilliQ system. Finally, it was treated with 5 g of Chelex (Bio-Rad)/1 liter to remove potentially contaminating metals. Ferrous chloride (FeCl2), hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, sodium nitrite, sodium dibasic phosphate, and potassium monobasic phosphate were from Fisher Scientific. ADP, glutathione reductase from yeast, glutathione peroxidase from bovine erythrocytes, glucose, trichloroacetic acid, and mono-carboxymethyl-BSA (BSA-CM) were from Sigma. NADPH, GAPDH, horseradish peroxidase, acetylated cytochrome c, and glucose oxidase were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. [35S]Glutathione was from ICN Radiochemicals. Glutaredoxin was isolated and purified as described previously (3Yang Y. Jao S.-C. Nanduri S. Starke D.W. Mieyal J.J. Qin J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17145-17156Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Sodium-potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 m) was used in all of the assays, diluted from 1 m stock solution that was prepared by adding 1 m potassium monobasic phosphate to 1 m sodium dibasic phosphate until the measured pH was 7.5. Stock solutions of Fe(II)·ADP complex were made by mixing equal volumes of FeCl2 (20 mm) and ADP (100 mm) solutions at least 1 h before beginning the experiments. Complete reaction mixtures contained 0.1 msodium-potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), various amounts of glutaredoxin, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.5 mm GSH, 2 units/ml GSSG reductase, and premixed 0.5 mm FeCl2, 2.5 mm ADP, and 0.05 mmH2O2. Reactions were initiated with the Fe(II)·ADP and H2O2 mixture. Controls omitting glutaredoxin and/or Fe(II)·ADP and H2O2 were performed in parallel. NADPH oxidation (equivalent to GSSG formation) was monitored at 340 nm using the extinction coefficient ε340 = 6.2 mm−1 cm−1. Factors correcting for path length in the plate reader were calculated and used to express rates as nmol GSSG formed per minute. Glutaredoxin enzyme was added as indicated in the figure legends, and time courses of product formation and dependence on enzyme concentration were determined. Experiments were conducted as described above with the exception that all of the solutions were bubbled for 15 min with an N2 lance. In some experiments, glucose (0.1 mm) and glucose oxidase (300 units/ml) were added to ensure complete oxygen depletion. Experimental results with N2 purging in the absence or presence of the glucose oxidase system were indistinguishable. Reactions were conducted as described above with the exception that partially acetylated cytochrome c (30–90 μm) was added to the initial mixture. Rates of GSSG formation were determined as above. Changes in absorbance at 550 nm were recorded in a plate reader, and rates of cytochrome c oxidation were calculated using ε550 = 18.5 mm−1cm−1. Glutathionyl radicals were generated by horseradish peroxidase utilizing H2O2 and GSH adapted from the studies of Harman et al. (22Harman L.S. Carver D.K. Schreiber J. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1642-1648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mason et al. (26Mason R.P. Rao D.N.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 319-329Google Scholar). The assays measured the incorporation of [35S]glutathione into GAPDH. Reaction mixtures contained 0.1 m sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 0.2 mg/ml HRP, 0.5 mm [35S]GSH (∼0.5 nCi/nmol), 28 μm GAPDH, 2 mg/ml BSA-CM). Glutaredoxin was added in various concentrations as indicated (see “Results”), and H2O2 was added to initiate the reaction. Reactions were quenched either immediately after initiation or at various reaction times by adding trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration) to precipitate the proteins. The precipitates were washed twice with 20% trichloroacetic acid and then solubilized with scintillation fluid and transferred into vials, and counts/minute were determined. BSA-CM served as a non-thiol-containing bulk protein to facilitate quantitative precipitation of GAPDH. The amount of GAPDH-SSG [35S]mixed disulfide was quantified according to the specific radioactivity calculated from GSH content and measurement of radiolabel in each reaction mixture. Incorporated radioactivity was confirmed to represent GAPDH-SSG formation by documenting quantitative release of radiolabel with 10 mmdithiothreitol. Glutathione disulfide (35S-labeled, ∼1 nCi/nmol) was prepared by incubating 5 mm GSSG with a trace amount of [35S]GSH overnight at room temperature.S-Nitrosoglutathione was prepared as described previously (27Clancy R.M. Abrahamson S.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) by combining [35S]GSH with equimolar amounts of acetic acid and sodium nitrite at room temperature for ≥5 min. We confirmed in separate model preparations with unlabeled GSH that this reaction gives stoichiometric conversion based on the extinction coefficient of GS-NO at 338 nm (ε338 = 980m−1 cm−1) (28Lobysheva I.I. Serezhnkov V.A. Vanin A.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 64: 153-158PubMed Google Scholar). GS-radical, GS-NO, and GSSG were compared as glutathionyl-donors for their relative ability to support S-glutathionylation of GAPDH in the absence or presence of glutaredoxin. Reaction mixtures contained 0.1m sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, 2 mg/ml BSA-CM, and 28 μm GAPDH, and one of the GS-donors was added to initiate the reaction as follows: [35S]GSSG (∼1 nCi/nmol; 0.05 or 0.5 mm) or [35S]GS-NO (∼1 nCi/nmol; 0.05 or 0.5 mm) or GS-thiyl radical (∼0.5 nCi/nmol; estimated as ≤0.01 mm). The concentration of GS-radicals probably represents an overestimate based on the amount of GSSG accumulated (GSSG reductase assay) in 15 min in the HRP GS-radical generating system. The reactions were quenched with trichloroacetic acid, and [35S]GAPDH-SSG was quantified according to the specific radioactivity of the respective glutathionyl donor as described above. Production of reactive oxygen species in cells is broadly implicated in signal transduction mechanisms as well as pathophysiological changes. However, characterization of the proximal mediators of these events is still unclear and under active investigation. To examine the participation of glutathione thiyl radical and the potential roles of glutaredoxin in regulating these events, we used the well known system comprised of the Fe(II)·ADP complex and H2O2 (20Floyd R.A. Lewis C.A. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2645-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21Floyd R.A. Arch. Biochem.

Med. 1997; 23: 373-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to produce hydroxyl radicals in the absence or presence of GSH and glutaredoxin. Hydroxyl radical production in the absence of GSH was documented by the conversion of salicylate to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate as reported previously (30Das D.K. George A. Liu X. Rao P.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 1004-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and the radical transfer reaction of hydroxyl radicals with GSH to produce glutathionyl thiyl radicals (18Wardman P. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 1-19Google Scholar) was confirmed by documenting GSH concentration-dependent inhibition of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate formation in the Fe(II)-ADP/H2O2 system with salicylate (data not shown). Although glutathionyl radical can form the disulfide anion radical (GSSG⨪) and react with oxygen to form superoxide and GSSG (31Yim M.B. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Winterbourn C.C. Metodiewa D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), this overall reaction is disfavored at neutral pH (33Wardman P. von Sonntag C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (See “Discussion,” Scheme FS1). Upon the addition of glutaredoxin, the formation of GSSG is accelerated over a time course that is linear for at least 5 min, consistent with a catalytic role for the enzyme. Accordingly, the reaction is enzyme concentration dependent (Fig. 1), and it depends on the native enzyme for activity, i.e. boiled enzyme is inactive (data not shown).Figure 1Dependence of GS-radical-mediated GSSGformation on glutaredoxin concentration. Glutaredoxin (0–0.88 μm) was preincubated at 30 °C with 0.5 mmGSH, 0.2 mm NADPH, and 2 units/ml GSSG reductase in 0.1m sodium/potassium phosphate buffer (see “Experimental Procedures”). Reactions were initiated by addition of a pre-made complex (containing 0.5 mm FeCl2 and 2.5 mm ADP) and 50 μmH2O2. Reactions were monitored continuously at 340 nm, and GSSG formed per minute was calculated from the initial linear portion of the time courses (≥4 min) according to the extinction coefficient of NADPH ε340 = 6.2 mm−1 cm−1. Inset, comparison of glutathione peroxidase and glutaredoxin as catalysts of GSSG formation from GSH and H2O2 in the absence of GS-radicals. Conditions were as described above with the exception that the Fe (II)·ADP complex was omitted precluding GS-radical formation and the H2O2 concentration was varied as shown. Either glutathione peroxidase (0.002 units/ml,triangles) or glutaredoxin (1 unit/ml,rectangles) was added as potential catalysts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The accelerated formation of GSSG is distinguished from a glutathione peroxidase-like activity of glutaredoxin, because glutaredoxin had no effect on the rate of formation of GSSG with only H2O2 and GSH in the absence of the Fe(II)·ADP complex. In contrast, glutathione peroxidase (positive control) added under the same conditions in the absence of Fe(II)·ADP efficiently catalyzed H2O2-dependent GSSG formation as expected. (Fig. 1, inset). To determine whether the glutaredoxin-catalyzed reaction involves the participation of molecular oxygen, we studied the effect of depleting oxygen. Fig.2 documents that the enzyme-catalyzed reaction requires O2 for efficient turnover and suggests coincident formation of superoxide (see “Discussion,” SchemeFS2).Figure FS2Catalytic mechanism of GS-radical scavenging by glutaredoxin. The scheme displays the proposed mechanism of oxygen-dependent glutaredoxin catalysis of GS-radical scavenging.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm this interpretation, we measured concomitant reduction of ferricytochrome c, which is diagnostic for superoxide formation (Fig. 3). Estimation of the stoichiometry of GSSG formation and superoxide formation (cytc reduction) is complicated by the presence of Fe(III)·ADP, which can compete with cyt c3+for reaction with superoxide (see “Discussion”). Such competition is indicated by the increasing rate of cyt c reduction that occurred as the cyt c concentration was increased (Fig.3). A significant consequence of oxidative stress in cells is the accumulation of protein-SSG-mixed disulfides, possibly representing a protective mechanism (2Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A.

Biophys. 1995; 319: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar).S-Glutathionylation of specific proteins has now been demonstrated also upon activation of signaling cascades in cell culture as well and probably represents a mode of regulation (9Barrett W.C.

Although many key proteins with specific cysteine residues that are subject to reversible glutathionylation have been characterized (2Mieyal J.J. Gravina S.A. Mieyal P.A. Srinivasan U. Starke D.W. Packer L. Cadenas E. Biothiols in Health and Disease. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1995: 305-372Google Scholar, 10Klatt P. Lamas S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4928-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), the mechanism(s) of formation of protein-SSG is unclear. One such protein whose glutathionylation has been studied in various contexts is glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. This abundant cytosolic protein has been observed to accumulate as GAPDH-SSG in cells after oxidative insults even though the GSSG concentration did not change substantially (23Chai Y.C. Hendrich S. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 24Chai Y.C. Ashraf S.S. Rokutan K. Johnston Jr., R.B. Thomas J.A. Arch. Biochem.

Biochem. 1994; 221: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suggesting that a form of the glutathione moiety other than GSSG was the proximal mediator of glutathionylation. Therefore, we tested the relative effectiveness of GS-radical to serve as the precursor of protein-SSG formation and examined whether glutaredoxin would facilitate the reaction. In this case, the GS-radical generating system was horseradish peroxidase, utilizing H2O2 as oxidant and GSH as reductant. This system allowed us to minimize direct reaction of H2O2 with GAPDH (35Lind C. Gerdes R. Schuppe-Koistinen I. Cotgreave I.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), because we could use a concentration of H2O2 10-fold lower than that for the Fe(II)·ADP/H2O2 system (described above) and still generate a significant steady-state concentration of GS-radical over the reaction time. Therefore,S-glutathionylation of GAPDH could be studied under conditions more closely related to a cellular signaling environment,i.e. low H2O2. Using this HRP GS-radical generating system, glutaredoxin did accelerate the rate of [35S]GAPDH-SSG formation in a time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner (Fig.4, inset). No enhancement of GAPDH-SSG formation occurred when the glutaredoxin enzyme was boiled before it was added or when either H2O2 or HRP was omitted from the reaction mixture (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that the enhancement of GAPDH-SSG formation requires native glutaredoxin and it is dependent on GS-radical formation. Fig.5 shows that removal of oxygen does not affect net GAPDH-SSG formation from GS-radicals in the presence of GRx (hatched bars), in contrast to the effect on GSSG formation (Fig. 2). However, in the absence of GRx, less GAPDH-SSG is formed under anaerobic conditions. Thus, the enhancement of GAPDH glutathionylation by GRx is greater in the absence of O2. This distinction suggests an oxygen-independent rate-limiting step for the GRx-mediated glutathionylation of proteins (see “Discussion,” Scheme FS4).Figure FS4Hypothetical mechanism of GS-radical transfer by glutaredoxin. The main scheme (inbox) displays a working hypothesis for glutaredoxin-facilitated S-glutathionylation of proteins by GS-radicals. An alternative less likely scheme is shown inbrackets (see “Discussion”).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Besides GSSG and the glutathione-thiyl radical, considerable attention has been focused on GS-NO as a potential mediator of protein-SSG formation (10Klatt P.

Therefore, we tested the relative ability of GSSG, GS-radical, and GS-NO to mediate GAPDH-SSG formation in the absence and presence of glutaredoxin (TableI). Although both GSSG and GS-NO could substitute for the GS-radical generating system and glutaredoxin accelerated GAPDH-SSG formation, the relative efficiency of these reactions was poor. Comparing the values in the right-most column of Table I, the GRx-mediated reactions for GS-NO and GSSG at 50 μm (>5× the concentration of GS-radical (<10 μm)) yielded less than half of the amount of GAPDH-SSG formed in the GS-radical reaction. Only at a very high concentration (500 μm) were GS-NO and GSSG as good or better donors for GRx-mediated GAPDH-glutathionylation as GS-radical at <10 μm.Table IGlutaredoxin-mediated GAPDH-S-glutathionylation with various glutathionyl donorsGS donor[35S]GAPDH-SSG formed in 15 minminus GRxplus GRxGRx-mediatedμmμmμmGS-radical (≤10 μm)0.7 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.21.2 ± 0.3GS-NO (50 μm)0.1 ± 0.10.4 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.2GS-NO (500 μm)1.0 ± 0.43.0 ± 0.62.0 ± 1.0GSSG (50 μm)0.2 ± 0.00.7 ± 0.20.5 ± 0.2GSSG (500 μm)1.1 ± 0.23.9 ± 0.32.8 ± 0.5GS-radical, GS-NO, and GSSG were compared for their relative ability to support 35S glutathionylation of GAPDH in the absence or presence of glutaredoxin.

These factors are integral parts of the innate machinery that translates initial detection of foreign pathogens, for example by epithelial cells, into activation of these cells, including production of chemokines and cytokines to in turn attract and activate professional immune cells. The innate system further involves NF-κB factors to produce antipathogenic effectors as well as chemokines and cytokines to mediate evolving cell-cell communications needed to coordinate responses. Depending on the exact nature of the initial innate response, NF-κB factors then help to develop the appropriate adaptive responses by lymphocytes. In the final phase of the immune response, NF-κB factors have important roles during the expansion and differentiation of lymphocytes involved in the adaptive response. Beyond the innate and adaptive antipathogenic responses, NF-κB factors are also essential during development and maintenance of lymphoid organ structures (6Franzoso G. Carlson L. Poljak L.

NF-κB is a collective term for a family of dimeric complexes comprised of combinations of five polypeptides, RelA, c-Rel, RelB, p50/NF-κB1, and p52/NF-κB2. p50 and p52 are the N-terminal parts of the longer p105/NF-κB1 and p100/NF-κB2 proteins, respectively, and they are generated by proteolytic processing (1Ghosh S.

High levels of p50 are produced constitutively by a cotranslational mechanism. In contrast, usually only small amounts of p52 exist in cells, but higher amounts may be induced by select signals. To activate NF-κB, appropriate environmental signals must bring about the release of NF-κB dimers from their bound cytoplasmic inhibitors, in particular from the prototypical inhibitor IκBα and its close relatives, IκBॆ and IκBκ (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar, 2Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar, 4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

NF-κB factors are in addition subject to various direct and indirect mechanisms that modulate their ability to stimulate transcription, dependent also on promoter context (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar, 2Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar, 5Brown K. Claudio E. Siebenlist U. Targeted Therapies in Rheumatology. Martin Dunitz Ltd., London, UK2002: 381-401Google Scholar), but the release from the inhibitors is a first and necessary step in the activation process. Most of the NF-κB activation signals, and in particular inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1, induce the phosphorylation of the IκBs followed by the rapid ubiquitin- and proteasome-mediated degradation of the inhibitors, thus freeing NF-κB dimers to migrate to the nucleus to initiate gene transcription (1Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar, 2Li Q. Verma I.M. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 725-734Google Scholar, 4Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev.

IκBs are phosphorylated on two conserved serines by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. IKKs consist of the catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKॆκ, and the regulatory subunit IKKγ (also known as Nemo). Most signals have been shown to activate NF-κB by the classical, IKK-dependent pathway and, in particular, to be dependent on the IKKॆ catalytic and IKKγ/Nemo regulatory subunit to bring about the degradation of small IκB inhibitors (1Ghosh S.

Genet. 2002; 11: 2371-2375Google Scholar). In addition to the small IκBs, the long forms of the NF-κB1 and NF-κB2 proteins, p105 and p100, can also act as cytoplasmic inhibitors of bound Rel proteins due to the presence of IκB-like inhibitory ankyrin domains in their C-terminal halves (1Ghosh S.

Martin Dunitz Ltd., London, UK2002: 381-401Google Scholar). p105 may be completely degraded in response to some signals in a manner similar to that of small IκBs, including IKKॆ/IKKγ-induced phosphorylation of two serines embedded in a small IκB-like phosphorylation motif (12Heissmeyer V. Krappmann D. Hatada E.N. Scheidereit C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1024-1035Google Scholar). Recently, a second or alternative signaling path has been reported to liberate NF-κB activity via induced processing of p100 inhibitor (13Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar, 14Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Google Scholar). Although physiologic signals for this pathway were not reported, processing was mediated by the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and IKKα. In the present report, we demonstrate that physiologic signaling via the lymphotoxin ॆ receptor (LTॆR) in stromal cells induced the degradation of IκBα via the classical pathway, and it induced processing of p100 via an alternative pathway. p100 processing was shown to be dependent on NIK and IKKα but independent of IKKॆ and IKKγ/Nemo. Therefore, the p100 processing pathway was entirely independent of the IKK complex, not just of the IKKॆ kinase subunit. We also demonstrate that transient activation of the classical pathway caused the transient activation of p50-RelA dimers, whereas the delayed and protein synthesis-dependent p100 processing led to the delayed and sustained liberation of p50-RelB and p52-RelB complexes. We also provide an explanation and supporting evidence for how p100 processing liberated p50-RelB complexes. IKKα−/− and IKKॆ−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were kindly provided by Drs. Q. Li and I. M. Verma, and IKKγ−/− MEFs were kindly provided by Drs. M. Pasparakis and K. Rajewsky. NF-κB1−/− and NF-κB2−/− MEFs were kindly provided by Dr. E. Claudio. To prepare embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type and aly/alymice, 12-day-old embryos were dissected, heads and inner organs were removed, and remaining parts were minced, filtered, and subjected to trypsin (0.257) digestion for 10 min at 37 °C. The resulting cells were filtered and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Fibroblasts were plated into 6-well plates at 105 cells/well 24 h prior To Whom It May Concern: stimulation. After treatment, cells were lysed in 100 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 47 SDS, 207 glycerol, sonicated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. MEFs were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were analyzed 24 h after transfection. Expression vectors for IKKα, IKKॆ, and NIK were kindly provided by Drs. R. Geleziunas and W. C. Greene (15Geleziunas R. Ferrell S. Lin X. Mu Y.

Human p100 was excised from a previously described expression vector (16Bours V. Burd P.R. Brown K. Villalobos J. Park S. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 685-695Google Scholar) and inserted into pcRSV (Invitrogen). For each nuclear preparation, 5 × 105 cells were plated 24 h prior to stimulation. Stimulation was done under serum-free conditions. Following stimulation, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared essentially as described (17Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Google Scholar). Briefly, fibroblasts were mechanically removed, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 400 ॖl of low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After a 15-min incubation on ice, Triton-X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.67, and the suspension was vigorously vortexed for 10 s. The nuclei were pelleted, and the supernatant served as cytoplasmic extract. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 ॖl of high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 400 mmNaCl, supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) and incubated for an additional 15 min on ice. 2.5 ॖl of this preparation were used in DNA binding reactions. An NF−κB-binding site from the κ light chain enhancer was used as a probe: 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (Promega, Madison, WI). Oct1 oligonucleotides were used in controls: 5′-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAGAA-3′. Complementary and annealed oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ– 32P]ATP. Approximately 20,000 cpm of probe were used per assay. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 15 min in a total volume of 25 ॖl containing 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ॖg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 47 glycerol. For supershift analyses, nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibodies for 30 min on ice prior to adding the probe. For Western blot analyses, 20 ॖl of each preparation were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The efficiency of the nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation was confirmed in several ways, including by the fact that entry of factors was dependent on stimulation and by the fact that RelA did not enter nuclei in NEMO-deficient cells, whereas RelB did (see Fig.6, A andC). For immunoprecipitation, cytoplasmic and nuclear preparations were generated from 1.5 × 106 cells/condition. These extracts were adjusted to 150 mm NaCl and mixed with anti-RelB antibodies (SC-848) or anti-NEMO antibodies (SC-8330) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as a negative control that had been conjugated to agarose beads (Pierce). Following a 2-h incubation at 4 °C, the agarose beads were washed four times in 150 mmNaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.3, 107 glycerol, 17 Triton-X-100, and the immunoprecipitated preparations were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The agonistic monoclonal anti-murine LTॆR antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. J. Browning and used at 10 ॖg/ml. For EMSA supershift experiments, the following antibodies to detect murine proteins were used: anti-RelA (SA-171) (Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA); anti-RelB (SC-226X), anti-c-Rel (SC-71X), anti-NF-κB1 (SC-114X), anti-NF-κB2 (SC-848X) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For Western analyses, the following antibodies were used: anti-IκBॆ (SC-945), anti-IκBα (SC-371), anti-RelB (SC-226), anti-c-Rel (SC-71) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polyclonal anti-murine RelA, anti-murine p105, and anti-human p100 antibodies (also detects murine p100) were raised against the 13 C-terminal amino acids (RelA), the 15 N-terminal amino acids (p105), and the 398 N-terminal amino acids (p100), respectively. TNFα was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ); Light and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Light was used at 20 ng/ml. The IKKॆ-specific inhibitor PS1145 was kindly provided by Dr. J. Adams, Millennium Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA). To inhibit protein synthesis, cells were pretreated with 50 ॖm cycloheximide (Sigma) for 30 min prior to stimulation. NF-κB2-deficient mice are impaired in their splenic microarchitecture, they lack Peyer's patches, and they are severely impaired in lymph node formation, primarily due to defects within the stromal compartment (6Franzoso G.

These deficiencies in secondary lymphoid organs, which also include loss of follicular dendritic cell networks, in turn contribute to defective immune responses in these mutant mice. Similar deficiencies have been noted inaly/aly mice (20Matsumoto M. Iwamasa K. Rennert P.D. Yamada T. Suzuki R. Matsushima A. Okabe M. Fujita S. Yokoyama M. J.

Matsuda F. Tashiro K. Ikuta K. Suzuki M. Kogishi K. Serikawa T. Honjo T. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 74-77Google Scholar). Overexpression of the wild-type form of NIK induces processing of the p100 protein of NF-κB2 to p52, but its mutant form (aly) does not (13Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Google Scholar). Furthermore, splenocytes fromaly/aly mice contain much less of the p52 protein of NF-κB2 than aly/+ mice while maintaining normal levels of p100 (21Yamada T. Mitani T. Yorita K. Uchida D. Matsushima A. Iwamasa K. Fujita S. Matsumoto M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 804-812Google Scholar). NIK-induced processing in B cells depends on IKKα (14Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Google Scholar), and thus IKKα-deficient B cells contain much less p52 protein (14Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krähn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.-C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Google Scholar). Finally, although IKKα-deficient animals die perinatally, which limits their analysis, it could nevertheless be shown that these mutant mice are deficient in Peyer's patches organogenesis (27Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H. Kurosawa K. Uchida D. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 631-636Google Scholar). Based on these data, we hypothesized that critical functions of the LTॆ receptor on stromal cells depend on signaling via NIK, IKKα, and NF-κB2 and thus may involve processing of p100. To test for this possibility, we subjected MEFs to an agonistic antibody directed against the LTॆR. We investigated with Western analyses for the expression of the NF-κB2 proteins p100 and p52, as well as the NF-κB1 proteins p105 and p50, the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB)α, IκBॆ, RelA, RelB, and c-Rel at six time points during an 8-h stimulation with anti-LTॆR antibodies (Fig.1). We also tested for expression of these proteins at 15 min and 8 h of stimulation with TNFα. The experiments revealed a marked decrease in p100 and a concomitant increase in p52, beginning just before 4 h and maximal by 8 h of stimulation via the LTॆR. No such changes in p100 and p52 levels were seen with TNFα stimulation. TNFα instead caused the nearly complete degradation of IκBα and the partial degradation of IκBॆ by 15 min of stimulation; IκBα levels were partly restored by 8 h of stimulation. LTॆR stimulation induced only a partial degradation of IκBα, which showed a delayed onset when compared with that induced by TNFα. The amounts of IκBα began to increase again after 2 h of stimulation via the LTॆR and were above starting levels by 8 h. Most likely this was due to increased synthesis in response to activated NF-κB, in the absence of continued degradation of this inhibitor (see below). We failed to observe consistent changes in the amounts of the other proteins analyzed in Fig. 1, with the exceptions of RelB, whose amounts were increased, and p105, whose amounts were modestly decreased after 8 h of stimulation with TNFα. In contrast to p52, the amounts of the p50 form of NF-κB1 did not increase after LTॆR stimulation. These data indicated that LTॆ receptor stimulation in MEFs caused processing of p100 to generate p52 and a more modest degradation of the IκBα inhibitory protein, implying engagement of two pathways to activate NF-κB. Light and the membrane-bound LTॆ2α are natural ligands of the LTॆ receptor. In addition to the agonistic antibody, Light could also be shown to induce processing of p100 to p52 in MEFs, whereas platelet-derived growth factor did not (Fig.2). Given the delayed onset of processing, we asked whether the underlying mechanisms might involve intermediate steps requiring protein synthesis. Light-induced processing of p100 was sensitive to the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (Fig. 2), and this result was confirmed when cells were stimulated with the agonistic antibody to the LTॆ receptor (data not shown). Thus, signal-induced processing of p100 required the new or continued synthesis of a protein, which could explain the slow onset of processing upon stimulation. Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying LTॆR-induced processing by taking advantage of mutant mice impaired or lacking in various signaling components. We generated MEFs fromaly/aly mice, which carry a mutation in NIK. Agonistic antibodies to the LTॆR failed to induce processing of p100 to p52 in aly/aly MEFs (Fig.3A). Therefore, NIK was required for LTॆR-mediated processing of p100, consistent with the ability of NIK to induce processing in transfected cells and the impaired LTॆR-induced NF-κB transcriptional activity in NIK-mutated and NIK-deficient MEFs (27Matsushima A. Kaisho T. Rennert P.D. Nakano H. Kurosawa K. Uchida D. Takeda K. Akira S. Matsumoto M. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 631-636Google Scholar, 28Yin L. Wu L. Wesche H. Arthur C.D. White J.M. Goeddel D.V. Schreiber R.D. Science. 2001; 291: 2162-2165Google Scholar). NIK was shown previously to depend on IKKα to induce processing in B cells, and consistent with this, LTॆR signaling also failed to induce processing in MEFs from IKKα-deficient mice (Fig. 3A; the 8-h-stimulated lane for these mutant cells contained slightly more protein, but the ratio of p100 to p52 did not change). Interestingly, MEFs from mice lacking IKKॆ or those lacking IKKγ (also known as Nemo) were permissive for LTॆR-induced processing of p100, as were MEFs deficient in NF-κB1 (Fig. 3A). (IKKα/IKK1-, IKKॆ/IKK2-, and Nemo/IKKγ-deficient mice are described in Refs.29Li Q. Lu Q. Hwang J.Y. Buscher D. Lee K.F. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Google Scholar, 30Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Google Scholar, 31Schmidt-Supprian M. Bloch W. Courtois G. Addicks K. Israel A. Rajewsky K. Pasparakis M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 981-992Google Scholar.) The regulatory subunit IKKγ and the two catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKॆ together constitute the classical IKK core complex. Therefore, although LTॆR-induced processing did require the IKKα subunit, it was nevertheless independent of the classical, IKKγ (Nemo)-containing IKK complex that controls degradation of the small IκB inhibitors in response to many signals. By comparison with wild-type MEFs, the amounts of p100 appeared to be somewhat reduced in NF-κB1- and IKKॆ-deficient MEFs but were especially reduced in IKKγ-deficient MEFs. Nevertheless, processing still occurred in response to LTॆR stimulation, resulting in a more substantial depletion of p100 in the mutant versus wild-type cells (a longer exposure of the IKKγ-deficient MEFs is shown in Fig.3A, lower panel). Basal and LTॆR-induced activation of NF-κB via the classical IKK to IκB degradation path may be required for optimal p100 expression. MEFs deficient in IKKγ may have contained especially low levels of p100 because the classical activation pathway was completely blocked in these mutant cells, whereas residual activity may have persisted in the IKKॆ-deficient mutants due to the presence of IKKα. We also used an IKKॆ-specific inhibitor, PS1145, to provide further support for the suggested role of the classical activation route in maintaining p100 levels while having no role in processing. To control for the activity of this inhibitor, we confirmed a dose-dependent inhibition of TNFα-induced degradation of IκBα after 15 min of stimulation (Fig.3B). Increasing amounts of PS1145 also decreased the amounts of p100 after 8 h of stimulation via the LTॆ receptor, presumably due to reduced new synthesis of p100, whereas processing to p52 was essentially unaffected (Fig. 3B). Therefore, optimal expression of p100 depended on basal and induced activation of the classical, IKK-mediated pathway for NF-κB, but processing of p100 did not and instead only depended on the IKKα subunit. It remained theoretically possible that the inability to process p100 in IKKα-deficient and NIK-impaired MEFs in response to LTॆ stimulation was not directly related to loss of IKKα or NIK function. We therefore tested whether transfection of these mutant and wild-type MEFs with p100 together with IKKα, IKKॆ, or NIK could confirm the conclusions reached with Fig. 2. Overexpression of IKKα and especially of NIK in wild-type MEFs induced processing of p100 to generate p52, whereas IKKॆ did not (Fig.4A). IKKα and NIK were similarly able to induce processing in IKKγ (Nemo)-deficient (Fig.4B), IKKॆ-deficient (Fig. 4D), and NIK-impaired (aly/aly) (Fig. 4E) MEFs. This confirmed that the classical Nemo/IKKॆ pathway was irrelevant for processing and that the inability of aly/aly MEFs to allow processing could be overcome simply by supplying wild-type NIK or IKKα. This latter result also placed IKKα downstream of NIK, which was confirmed by the fact that overexpression of IKKα in IKKα-deficient MEFs resulted in processing, whereas overexpression of wild-type NIK did not (Fig. 4C). Therefore, we concluded that processing of p100 to p52 as induced by LTॆR stimulation depended on and proceeded via NIK and then IKKα but was independent of classical IKKγ (Nemo) and IKKॆ-dependent NF-κB activation; classical IKK activity did, however, help maintain p100 levels. Next, we investigated LTॆR-initiated NF-κB activation in EMSAs designed to determine the composition of activated NF-κB. Wild-type MEFs contained some basal κB DNA binding activity composed primarily of p50 homodimers and p50-RelA heterodimers (faster and slower migrating shifted bands, respectively), as assessed in EMSA supershift experiments with antibodies to the various NF-κB subunits (Fig. 5A). Approximately equal amounts of extracts were loaded, and this was confirmed in separate EMSAs in which DNA binding activity to the cognate site for the Octamer-1 transcription factor was assessed (data not shown). LTॆR stimulation for 2 h resulted in increased amounts of DNA binding activity composed primarily of p50-RelA and, to a lesser degree, p50-RelB (Fig. 5B; RelA supershifts marked). After 8 h of stimulation, the binding activity of p50-RelA dimers had decreased, whereas p50-RelB activity had increased further, and p52-RelB activity could be detected as well (Fig. 5C; RelB and p52 supershifts marked). In addition, p50 homodimer binding activity appeared to have increased somewhat. No significant c-Rel DNA binding activity was noted in these MEFs, although this antibody was able to detect c-Rel binding in lympho"

As a consequence, organisms have regulatory mechanisms that maintain nutrient homeostasis and deal with damage caused by stress. For example, deficiency of an essential nutrient often induces expression of the genes involved in acquiring that nutrient. Stresses such as heat shock or reactive oxygen species increase expression of genes whose products reverse the resultant cellular damage. As a rule, these regulatory systems are reactionary in nature, responding to the stress to alter levels of gene expression and/or protein activity. An alternative strategy would be to increase expression of the required genes prior to, rather than in response to the specific stress. We designate this latter strategy as “proactive” regulation to distinguish it from the commonly recognized “reactive” responses. In this report, we describe an apparent proactive mechanism of zinc homeostasis in the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, the up-regulation of a metal tolerance gene in zinc-deficient cells as protection against “zinc shock.” Zinc is an essential nutrient required for many processes. Its chemical properties make this metal a useful catalytic and/or structural cofactor in many proteins. Despite its importance however, excess zinc is toxic. Zinc toxicity may involve competition with other metal ions for the active sites of enzymes or intracellular transport proteins. For this reason, organisms have evolved with mechanisms of zinc homeostasis that tightly control the intracellular level of zinc as extracellular concentrations change. An indication of the exquisite precision of this control was recently obtained in studies ofEscherichia coli, where regulatory systems controlling zinc uptake and efflux apparently strive to maintain the free intracellular zinc concentration at less than one atom per cell (1Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that eukaryotic cells also maintain very low levels of cytoplasmic labile zinc under steady-state conditions (2Cheng C. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 3Atar D. Backx P.H. Appel M.M. Gao W.D. Marban E. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2000; 529: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Studies of yeast have revealed several components of zinc homeostasis in this organism (5Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Among these, the ZRC1 gene encodes a potential transporter protein of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) family (6Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This family also includes bacterial, plant, and mammalian proteins involved in zinc efflux and compartmentalization.ZRC1 is known to contribute to zinc tolerance (7Kamizono A. Nishizawa M. Teranishi Y. Murata K. Kimura A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 8Conklin D.S. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the Zrc1 protein was localized to the yeast vacuole membrane (9Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 79-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 10Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 39187-39194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Our recent in vitro studies provided evidence that Zrc1 directly mediates vacuolar zinc transport, most likely via a zinc/H+ antiport mechanism (11MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39187-39194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The COT1 gene encodes a related protein that may act analogously to Zrc1 in cobalt detoxification (8Conklin D.S. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 244: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 12Conklin D.S. McMaster J.A. Culbertson M.R. Kung C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3678-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cot1 also contributes to zinc detoxification (13Bloss T. Clemens S. Nies D.H. Planta. 2002; 214: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) and both Zrc1 and Cot1 appear to be required for sequestration of zinc in an intracellular storage compartment for later use under zinc-limiting conditions (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). During the transition from zinc-replete to zinc-limiting conditions, many genes are induced to maintain adequate supplies of zinc for cell growth. Three such genes, ZRT1, ZRT2, andFET4 encode plasma membrane transporters responsible for zinc uptake under deficient conditions (15Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 16Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 17Waters B.M. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33749-33757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). All three genes are targets of the Zap1 transcriptional activator (18Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), a central player in zinc homeostasis. Zap1 is active in zinc-limited cells and is repressed by high cytoplasmic/nuclear zinc (19Bird A.J. Zhao H. Luo H. Jensen L.T. Srinivasan C. Evans-Galea M. Winge D.R. Eide D.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3704-3713Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). When active, Zap1p binds to an 11-bp sequence, the zinc response element (ZRE),1 in the promoters of its target genes (20Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). DNA microarray analysis has suggested that at least 46 genes in yeast are direct targets of Zap1 regulation (21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this group and others (22Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) noted ZRC1 among these Zap1 target genes. These data raise an intriguing question. Why would a transporter involved in zinc storage and detoxification be up-regulated under zinc-limiting conditions? One potential explanation was suggested by our previous studies of zinc uptake by zinc-deficient cells. Due to the induction of ZRT1, ZRT2, and FET4, the maximum capacity for zinc uptake by zinc-limited cells is ∼100-fold greater than in zinc-replete cells (15Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 16Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, when even a low concentration of zinc is added back to zinc-limited cells, the metal is rapidly overaccumulated, a condition we refer to as zinc shock. In this report we show that the increased expression of ZRC1 in zinc-limited cells is essential for the cell's ability to tolerate the stress of zinc shock. Four different media were used for yeast cultures. YPD and synthetic-defined (S.D.) medium with 2% glucose (23Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar) are zinc-replete and contain no strong chelators. Low zinc medium (LZM) and chelex-treated synthetic-defined (CSD) medium were prepared as previously described (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). LZM is zinc limiting because of the inclusion of 1 mm EDTA and 20 mmcitrate as divalent cation chelators. CSD is zinc limiting because zinc is removed from the medium with the chelex-100 ion exchange resin. Zinc supplemented into CSD is much more bioavailable than in LZM due to the absence of strong chelators in CSD. Cell density determinations and β-galactosidase assays were performed as previously described (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar).S. cerevisiae strains CM100, 102, 103, 104, and 142 were also previously described (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). All newly constructed strains are isogenic to CM100. CM141 (MATα zrt1::LEU2 zrc1::HIS3) was derived from a cross of ZHY1 (15Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and CM102. The CM146 (MATa zrc1mZRE) strain was constructed by integrating the insert of YCpzrc1mZRE at the chromosomal ZRC1 locus. Transformants were selected by complementation of the zinc-sensitive phenotype of a zrc1 cot1 double mutant strain (CM104), and the presence of the mutation was verified using PCR. The cot1 mutation was then removed by backcrossing to a wild-type strain. To construct the YEpzrc1mZRE plasmid, overlap PCR was used to generate transversion mutations in the ZRE sequence of the ZRC1promoter (24Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The resulting fragment was inserted intoBlpI-, BstXI-digested YCpZRC1 (11MacDiarmid C.W. Milanick M.A. Eide D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39187-39194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) by gap repair. Construction of YEpZRC1-lacZ was previously described (21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). YEpzrc1mZRE-lacZ was constructed by amplifying theZRC1 promoter from YEpzrc1mZRE and inserting the fragment into YEp353 by gap repair. All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Total protein was extracted from yeast, and immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (25Gitan R.S. Eide D.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Anti-Vma1 antibody was obtained from Molecular Probes. Zinc uptake was assayed as described (15Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Standard zinc uptake assays were performed in LZM lacking EDTA (LZM-EDTA) to increase the bioavailability of the zinc tracer. To determine cell-associated zinc after growth in65Zn2+-containing medium, 1-ml aliquots of cells were collected on glass fiber filters (Whatman) and washed twice with 5 ml of wash buffer (20 mm sodium citrate, pH 4, 1 mm EDTA). Radioactivity retained on the filters was quantified with a gamma counter. 65Zn2+ uptake by cells loaded with FuraZin-1 (see below) was assayed in the same buffer used for assays of fluorophore fluorescence to allow direct comparison of total cell and vacuolar zinc accumulation under these conditions. Yeast cultures (250 ml) were grown to log phase in LZM + 2 μmzinc. Cells were harvested, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline at a final density of 3 × 108 cells/ml. 50 μg of FuraZin-1 acetoxymethyl (AM) ester was dissolved in 16.6 μl of a 20% Pluronic solution (both obtained from Molecular Probes) and the solution diluted 4-fold with Me2SO to give a stock solution of 1.25 mm fluorophore and 5% Pluronic. Fluorophore was added to a 1-ml aliquot of the cell suspensions to give a final concentration of 25 μm. Another 1-ml aliquot of each strain was treated in parallel but without exposure to fluorophore. The cell suspensions were incubated at 30 °C in the dark for 1 h with agitation. The cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with 5 ml of chilled zinc uptake buffer (10 mm MES-Tris, pH 6.5, 4 mm MgCl2, 2% glucose) and 1 mmEDTA and then incubated at 30 °C for another 30 min. This step allowed the cells to redistribute cytoplasmic fluorophore to the vacuole and complete its hydrolysis. The cells were then chilled and washed twice with MES-Tris uptake buffer (−EDTA). Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of uptake buffer and maintained on ice prior to zinc uptake assays. Fluorimetric assays of fluorophore speciation were performed in a Hitachi F3010 spectrofluorimeter. To start the assay, an aliquot of loaded cells (100 μl) was added to 4 ml of MES-Tris uptake buffer and 100 μm zinc. The temperature of the cuvette was maintained at 30 °C using a recirculating water bath. With the instrument set at maximum scan speed, the excitation wavelength was varied from 250 to 450 nm, and the intensity of emission at 500 nm was recorded. Spectra were recorded at the start of the assay and at 2-min intervals for up to 6 min. To correct for the effects of fluorophore leakage during the experiment, immediately before each measurement a 1-ml aliquot of the assay was removed and filtered through a 0.45-μm syringe filter. After completion of the experiment, unloaded cells were added to samples of the filtered buffer to give the same cell density as present in the initial suspensions. Spectra of these samples were immediately recorded and the curves subtracted from the original spectra. This procedure provided a one-step correction for both cellular autofluorescence and leakage of fluorophore from the cells during the experiment. The corrected traces were scanned to obtain emission intensities at the excitation wavelengths of 325 and 380 nm. A previous study indicated that both Zrc1 and Cot1 contribute to tolerance of excess zinc (13Bloss T. Clemens S. Nies D.H. Planta. 2002; 214: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the yeast strain INVSC2, wild-type and cot1 cells were resistant to zinc concentrations up to ∼5 mm. Mutant zrc1 cells tolerated up to 1 mm, but the zrc1 cot1 mutant was not viable at this zinc concentration. In our strain background (W303), we obtained qualitatively similar results (Fig.1). Wild-type cells showed tolerance to up to 6 mm zinc. The zrc1 mutation caused a slight defect in zinc tolerance, reducing the inhibitory concentration by 1–3 mm. The cot1 mutation had little effect, only lowering the maximum tolerable concentration to 5 mm. In contrast to these minor effects, the zrc1 cot1 double mutant strain showed a ∼50-fold reduction in the tolerable zinc concentration (0.07 mm) relative to the single mutants. These observations demonstrated that Zrc1 and Cot1 are functionally redundant for protection against high levels of zinc under steady-state conditions. However, even with the loss of both genes, yeast was still tolerant of a relatively high concentration of zinc (70 μm). Previous studies suggested a role for Zrc1 in zinc-limited cells. Specifically, expression of the ZRC1 gene is induced in zinc-limited cells in a Zap1-dependent manner (21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore, theZRC1 promoter contains a potential ZRE that is functional when inserted into a heterologous promoter (21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). To further examine this regulation, a mutant ZRC1 promoter-lacZ fusion was generated in which all nucleotides in the putative ZRE were altered by transversion mutations. Strains bearing wild-type or ZRE mutant reporter plasmids were cultured in LZM supplemented with a range of zinc levels and then assayed for β-galactosidase activity (LZM is zinc limiting because it contains EDTA, which chelates most zinc in the medium rendering it unavailable to cells). The wild-type promoter was strongly induced under zinc-limited conditions (Fig.2A). Added zinc reduced expression to ∼20% of the maximal level. This basal expression ofZRC1 is Zap1-independent (21Lyons T.J. Gasch A.P. Gaither L.A. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Eide D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7957-7962Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Consistent with this conclusion, mutation of the ZRE completely eliminated zinc-responsive regulation without affecting basal expression. This result supports the contention that ZRC1 is transcriptionally regulated by Zap1 through this ZRE. Furthermore, the ZRE mutant promoter provided a useful reagent for subsequent studies (see below). Transcriptional control of ZRC1 was also reflected in altered protein levels. We examined the accumulation of protein expressed from a functional (data not shown) epitope-tagged allele ofZRC1 regulated by its own promoter and integrated into its native chromosomal location. Immunoblot analysis showed that two closely spaced bands representing forms of the Zrc1 protein accumulated to higher levels in zinc-deficient cells (LZM + 0.3–10 μm zinc) compared with zinc-replete cells (Fig.2B). No bands of this size were detected in protein from a control strain expressing untagged Zrc1 (data not shown). The level of a loading control protein, Vma1, was minimally affected by zinc status. The Zap1-dependent regulation ofZRC1 suggested that the Zrc1 protein is required during zinc deficiency. Supporting this hypothesis, it was previously reported thatzrc1 mutants grew poorly compared with wild type under zinc-limiting conditions (22Miyabe S. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Contrary to that previous result, however, we found no defect in zinc-limited growth (LZM + 0.3–10 μm zinc) for zrc1, cot1, orzrc1 cot1 cells (Fig.3A). The explanation for the apparent discrepancy between our results and the prior study will be presented under “Discussion.” The sensitivity of the zrc1 cot1 mutant to high zinc (LZM + 30–1000 μm zinc) is consistent with the redundancy of Zrc1 and Cot1 in steady-state zinc tolerance. To determine the effect of these mutations on zinc accumulation, we measured the total zinc content of wild-type and mutant strains after growth over a range of added zinc. Again, at zinc concentrations of 10 μm or less, these mutations had no effect on cell zinc content (Fig. 3B). In medium supplemented with 30 μm zinc or more, all three mutant strains accumulated less zinc than wild type, and the zrc1 cot1 double mutant accumulated less than either single mutant. Notably, these effects of zrc1 and cot1 mutations on growth and zinc accumulation were observed only at zinc concentrations in LZM of greater than 10 μm. This concentration was previously identified as the transition point between zinc deficiency and repletion (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). This can also be seen as such here because for the wild-type strain, the maximum growth rate is observed at 10 μm zinc and higher. Thus, we found no evidence that Zrc1 or Cot1 are required for zinc-limited growth or alter zinc homeostasis in zinc-limited cells. To test for an effect of high ZRC1 activity on zinc homeostasis in zinc-deficient cells, we overexpressed the gene from a multicopy plasmid and measured the effect on total cellular zinc accumulation. We confirmed an increase in Zrc1 protein level due to overexpression in both high and low zinc media (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4A, overexpression of ZRC1 significantly increased cellular zinc content when cells were grown under zinc-replete conditions. Importantly, it had no effect in zinc-deficient conditions (Fig.4A, inset). The effect of this increased zinc accumulation on cytoplasmic zinc availability was then determined. Methods to directly measure cytoplasmic labile zinc are not currently available, but we have previously shown that an indirect assessment of this parameter can be made using a Zap1-regulated reporter gene (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). ZRE-lacZ reporter activity was significantly increased in cells that overexpressed ZRC1, indicating reduced cytoplasmic labile zinc. This observation is consistent with a model whereby Zrc1 expression results in zinc transport from the cytoplasmic/nuclear compartment into an organelle. Again however, an effect of Zrc1 was only seen in cells that were zinc-replete. In summary, the experiments shown in Figs. 3 and 4 revealed no evidence for an effect of Zrc1 on zinc homeostasis in yeast cells during growth under steady-state zinc-deficient conditions. Thus, while it is not possible to rule out a more subtle role not revealed by these assays, these experiments did not provide an obvious explanation for why ZRC1 is up-regulated in zinc-deficient cells. In the experiments shown in Fig. 1, zinc-replete cells were used to inoculate plates. Zinc-replete cells have repressed high-affinity zinc uptake systems and do not accumulate excess zinc when inoculated into fresh medium. In contrast, when zinc-limited cells are resupplied with zinc, they rapidly accumulate large quantities because of the high activity of the plasma membrane zinc transporters (15Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). We refer to this condition as zinc shock. During zinc shock, newly acquired zinc rapidly enters the cytoplasm where it can accumulate to high levels. We hypothesized that yeast detoxify this excess zinc by rapid transport into an intracellular compartment. If this is true, the high expression of the ZRC1 zinc tolerance gene in zinc-deficient cells may be required to mediate the rapid sequestration of excess cytoplasmic zinc during zinc shock. This model predicts that azrc1 mutant will be hypersensitive to zinc shock; a prediction we confirmed (Fig.5A). The medium used in this experiment, CSD, is made zinc limiting by treatment with a chelating resin. Because CSD contains no strong chelators, the availability of added zinc is many orders of magnitude higher than for equivalent concentrations of total zinc in LZM. When zinc-limited zrc1mutants (i.e. pregrown in LZM + 1 μmZnCl2) were inoculated into CSD medium supplemented with as little as 1 μm zinc, zrc1 cells failed to grow. In contrast, neither the wild-type nor the cot1 mutant showed any growth defect up to 10 μm zinc (the increase in growth yield observed for the wild-type and cot1 strains with increased zinc is due to zinc-limitation in CSD with less than 1 μm added zinc). The zrc1 cot1 mutant was even more sensitive to zinc shock than the zrc1 mutant, indicating Cot1 also contributes to zinc shock tolerance. None of these cell types were zinc sensitive when inoculated from zinc-replete cultures (i.e. pregrown in LZM + 1 mmZnCl2) (Fig. 5B). Thus, the sensitivity is a consequence of the transition from zinc-limited to zinc-replete conditions. The retarded growth of the zrc1 cot1 mutant when inoculated from zinc-replete under zinc-limiting conditions does not correspond to zinc toxicity (because growth at higher zinc concentrations is similar to wild-type), and may be due to the low vacuolar zinc stores in this mutant (14MacDiarmid C.W. Gaither L.A. Eide D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2845-2855Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). While the Zrt1, Zrt2, and Fet4 plasma membrane uptake transporters are induced in zinc-limited cells, Zrt1 is the major pathway of zinc uptake; mutation of ZRT1 reduces zinc uptake in zinc-deficient cells by ≥80% (16Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predicted that zinc shock results largely from the high activity of Zrt1 in deficient cells. To test this prediction, we examined the effect of azrt1 mutation on the zinc sensitivity of a zrc1mutant. As before, zinc-deficient cells were inoculated into CSD medium containing no zinc or 1 μm added zinc. Thezrt1 mutation completely suppressed the zinc sensitivity associated with the zrc1 mutation (Fig. 5C). These data indicate that the high level of zinc accumulation mediated by Zrt1 in zinc-limited cells is responsible for the zinc sensitivity of zrc1 mutants undergoing zinc shock. Poor growth of thezrt1 and zrt1 zrc1 mutants without added zinc is likely due to the impaired zinc uptake in these strains. To assess if zinc sequestration is altered in zrc1 and cot1 mutants during zinc shock, we first assayed the effects of these mutations on zinc accumulation. Accumulation of substrate on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane can directly inhibit the transporters responsible for uptake, for example via trans-inhibition (26Stein W.D. Channels, carriers, and pumps: an introduction to membrane transport. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 199-200Google Scholar, 27Grenson M. Pont J.J.H.H.M.D. Molecular aspects of transport proteins. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1992: 219-245Google Scholar). Data from zinc uptake experiments (15Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) predicted that in the absence of any intracellular compartmentalization during zinc shock, cytoplasmic zinc levels would rise into the millimolar range within minutes. Under these conditions, mutant strains unable to sequester zinc might exhibit impaired zinc uptake due to trans-inhibition. To test this prediction, zinc accumulation by wild-type, zrc1,cot1, and zrc1 cot1 mutants under zinc shock conditions was compared; i.e. zinc-deficient cells were transferred to an uptake buffer that c"

Because of its low toxicity, SAHA is currently evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. SAHA and TSA induce apoptosis, which is characterized by mitochondrial stress, but so far, the critical elements of this apoptotic program remain poorly defined. To characterize in more detail this apoptotic program, we used human cell lines containing alterations in important elements of apoptotic response such as: p53, Bcl-2, caspase-9, and caspase-3. We demonstrate that caspase-9 is critical for apoptosis induced by SAHA and TSA and that efficient proteolytic activation of caspase-2, caspase-8, and caspase-7 strictly depends on caspase-9. Bcl-2 efficiently antagonizes cytochrome c release and apoptosis in response to both histone deacetylase inhibitors. We provide evidences that translocation into the mitochondria of the Bcl-2 family member Bid depends on caspase-9 and that this translocation is a late event during TSA-induced apoptosis.

We also demonstrate that the susceptibility to TSA- and SAHA-induced cell death is regulated by p53. histone deacetylase wild type catalytic-inactive caspase-3 catalytic inactive caspase-3 WT caspase-9 dominant negative daunorubicin 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine histone deacetylase inhibitor green fluorescent protein p53 dominant negative polyADP-ribosyltransferase suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid trichostatin-A z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone neomycin tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid adenovirus early region 1A Histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 are emerging as important components that affect the dynamics of chromatin folding during gene transcription (1Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). HDACs catalyze the hydrolyisis of acetyl groups from amino-terminal lysine residues of the nucleosomal core histones (1Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar, 2Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDIs) are promising agents for anticancer therapy; they exhibit strong antitumor activities in vivo with low toxicity in preclinical studies.HADC inhibitors belong to a heterogenous class of compounds that includes derivatives of short chain fatty acids, hydroxamic acids, cyclic tetrapetides, and benzamides. Among the hydroxamic acids, trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are commonly used inhibitors of HDACs (3Melnick A. Licht J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 322-332Google Scholar, 4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Google Scholar).Numerous anti-proliferative effects have been reported for TSA and SAHA, including induction of G0/G2 cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and selective apoptosis of transformed cells (5Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707Google Scholar, 6Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cordon-Cardo C. Thaler H.T. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5165-5170Google Scholar). SAHA, in particular, shows strong anti-proliferative effects but low toxicity in vivo and is currently under clinical trials for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors (3Melnick A. Licht J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 322-332Google Scholar, 4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Google Scholar).The cystein proteases, which belong to the family of caspases, play a critical role in the apoptotic response (9Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Google Scholar, 10Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar, 11Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar). Several anticancer drugs exert their antineoplastic activity by inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Various of these antitumor drugs trigger mitochondrial stress that can lead to apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9 activates the effectors caspase-3 and -7, which then trigger cell fragmentation by cleaving selected death substrates and also process different caspases, thus leading to the generation of the amplification loop (12Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Google Scholar, 13Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Google Scholar).An alternative apoptotic pathway is triggered by the cell surface death receptor (extrinsic pathway), which includes caspase-8 and caspase-10 as apical caspases (10Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar, 11Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar, 14Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Google Scholar). However by cleaving Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, these caspases can induce mitochondria permeabilization and activation of the amplifier function of the apoptosome (15Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Google Scholar).Chemoresistance is frequently caused by aberrant apoptosis that in some instances has been related to defects in caspase activation (16Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X. McCombie R. Herman J.G. Gerald W.L. Lazebnik Y.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 207-211Google Scholar, 17Liu J.R. Opipari A.W. Tan L. Jiang Y. Zhang Y. Tang H. Nunez G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 924-931Google Scholar). Therefore, the definition of the apoptotic pathway that is induced by a particular anticancer drug is important to design therapeutic trials and clinical treatment.The mechanism of HDI-induced apoptosis has only been marginally addressed. The role of the tumor suppressor p53 in the HDI-triggered apoptosis is not clear. Some reports have suggested an effect of p53 in this apoptotic response (18Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Google Scholar), whereas other studies have pointed to a p53-independent apoptotic response (22Vrana J.A. Decker R.H. Johnson C.R. Wang Z. Jarvis W.D. Richon V.M.

Mitochondrial stress and release of cytochrome c mark the apoptotic response to HDIs (5Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707Google Scholar, 23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hahn E.G. Schuppan D. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 233-240Google Scholar), and changes in the expression of Bcl-2 family members such as Bcl-2, Bax, or Bad have been detected in some cell lines (26Herold C. Ganslmayer M. Ocker M. Hermann M. Geerts A. Hahn E.G. Schuppan D. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 233-240Google Scholar, 27Sawa H. Murakami H. Ohshima Y. Sugino T. Nakajyo T. Kisanuki T. Tamura Y. Satone A. Ide W. Hashimoto I. Kamada H. Brain Tumor Pathol. 2001; 18: 109-114Google Scholar). Caspase-3 activation was reported by different studies (5Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707Google Scholar, 23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hahn E.G. Schuppan D. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 233-240Google Scholar), but cell death after SAHA treatment was observed also in the presence of pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar). However, the same study suggested that a caspase not efficiently inhibited by zVAD-fmk could be involved in transducing the apoptotic signal triggered by SAHA (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar).Our work was designed to identify the critical elements involved in transducing HDI-induced apoptotic signals. Human cell lines containing known mutations in key elements of the apoptotic pathway allowed us to elucidate caspase-9 requirements in the apoptotic response to HDIs. We show that HDI-induced proteolytic activation of caspase-2, caspase-8, and caspase-7 was strictly dependent on caspase-9. Moreover, HDIs provoke, late during apoptosis, translocation of the Bcl-2 family member Bid into the mitochondria, and this translocation also depends on caspase-9. We also show that Bcl-2 efficiently antagonizes cytochrome c release and apoptosis in response to TSA. Finally, we demonstrate that the susceptibility to cell death in response to TSA and SAHA treatment is regulated by p53.DISCUSSIONThe definition of the apoptotic pathway triggered by an anti-cancer drug is important to predict the efficacy of a particular chemotherapeutic treatment including that agent. The HDIs are promising anticancer drugs as they selectively induce differentiation and cell death of transformed cells, and some of them are now under clinical trials for both solid and hematological tumors (3Melnick A. Licht J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 322-332Google Scholar, 4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Google Scholar, 6Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3003-3007Google Scholar).The selectivity of HDIs toward transformed cells as compared with untransformed normal cells has been confirmed by our work. We provide evidence that a single oncogenic lesion, such as EIA expression, renders IMR90 fibroblasts highly susceptible to cell death when grown in the presence of SAHA or TSA. We have also confirmed that mitochondria play a central role during HDI-mediated apoptotic response (5Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707Google Scholar, 23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar, 24Zhu W.G. Lakshmanan R.R. Beal M.D. Otterson G.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1327-1333Google Scholar, 26Herold C. Ganslmayer M. Ocker M. Hermann M. Geerts A. Hahn E.G. Schuppan D. J. Hepatol. 2002; 36: 233-240Google Scholar). In addition, our data demonstrate that the initiator caspase-9 is critical for this cell death pathway. In IMR90-E1A and in MCF-7 cells, abrogation of caspase-9 activity suppressed apoptosis in response to TSA or SAHA and blocked processing of PARP, caspase-2, -7, and -8.TSA- and SAHA-induced processing of Bid and subsequent translocation to mitochondria were also dependent on caspase-9. These data suggest that Bid could play a role in the amplification loop rather than during the initial phase of the process in HDI-induced cell death. A late function of Bid is supported by the time-lapse analysis. Translocation of Bid to mitochondria was observed in vivo during TSA-induced cell death after 46.17 (±25.01) min from the appearance of the first signs of cell death (cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing). A previous study suggested that a caspase not efficiently inhibited by zVAD-fmk could be responsible for Bid cleavage in response to SAHA (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar). The current study supports the notion that this caspase is caspase-9 or a caspase regulated by caspase-9.Our findings do not exclude a role for the initiator caspase-2 and -8 upstream of caspase-9 during HDI-induced cell death. We used proenzyme cleavage as marker of caspase-2 and -8 activation. However, regulative caspases might also be activated in the absence of proteolytic processing (44Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L. Humke E.W. Reed J.C. Dixit V.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8359-8362Google Scholar). Recent studies have showed that caspase-2 can be activated independently from proteolytic processing (45Read S.H. Baliga B.C. Ekert P.G. Vaux D.L. Kumar S. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 739-745Google Scholar), and therefore, further investigations are needed to assess whether caspase-2 plays a role as regulator of the mitochondrial integrity (28Paroni G. Henderson C. Schneider C. Brancolini C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15147-15161Google Scholar,46Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y. Science. 2002; 297: 1352-1354Google Scholar, 47Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29803-29809Google Scholar, 48Guo Y. Srinivasula S.M. Druilhe A. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13430-13437Google Scholar), upstream of caspase-9 during apoptosis induced by HDIs. Concerning caspase-8, a critical role of this initiator caspase during HDI-induced cell death should be excluded since it has been reported that its inhibition, through expression of the cowpox virus protein CrmA, did not affect SAHA-induced cell death (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar).We demonstrate that p53 is essential for an efficient apoptotic response to TSA and SAHA treatments. The role of p53 has been investigated by using primary human fibroblasts transformed with E1A and Ha-Ras-V12 where p53 was inactivated by ectopic expression MDM2 or p53DN mutant (42Seger Y.R. Garcia-Cao M. Piccinin S. Cunsolo C.L. Doglioni C. Blasco M.A. Hannon G.J. Maestro R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 401-413Google Scholar). Our data are in disagreement with a previous report, which suggested the existence of a p53-independent apoptotic pathway in response to SAHA (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar). Indeed, although we find that p53 does affect the rate of HDI-induced cell death, prolonged treatments with these inhibitors can also induce a p53-independent response. It is thus likely that such a delayed p53-independent response was the one described previously (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar).Moreover, it has also been reported that conditional expression of p53 failed to modify the apoptotic response to SAHA in U937 cells (22Vrana J.A. Decker R.H. Johnson C.R. Wang Z. Jarvis W.D. Richon V.M. Ehinger M. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7016-7025Google Scholar). U937 cells do not express p73 (51Stiewe T. Putzer B.M. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 464-469Google Scholar), and it is known that the p53 family members p63 and p73 can modulate the p53 apoptotic response (49Zacchi P. Gostissa M. Uchida T. Salvagno C. Avolio F. Volinia S. Ronai Z. Blandino G. Schneider C. Del Sal G. Nature. 2002; 419: 853-857Google Scholar, 50Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Google Scholar). In fact, the combined loss of p63 and p73 results in the failure of cells containing functional p53 to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage (50Flores E.R. Tsai K.Y. Crowley D. Sengupta S. Yang A. McKeon F. Jacks T. Nature. 2002; 416: 560-564Google Scholar). Therefore, the absence of p73 expression might account for the inability of these cells to mount a p53-dependent apoptosis in response to SAHA (22Vrana J.A. Decker R.H. Johnson C.R. Wang Z. Jarvis W.D. Richon V.M. Ehinger M. Fisher P.B. Grant S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7016-7025Google Scholar).A differential behavior was noted for TSA- and SAHA-induced apoptosis relative to the rate of the dependence from p53. Cells lacking functional p53 were still resistant to cell death after long term treatments with SAHA (48 h), whereas apoptosis was induced in the same cells after long term treatments with TSA. One could postulate that since TSA is an inhibitor of HDACs at nanomolar range, whereas SAHA is efficient at micromolar range (3Melnick A. Licht J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 322-332Google Scholar), this difference could mirror the potency of the two HDIs. In fact, we observed that histone H3 acetylation was more pronounced in cells treated with TSA.Several models could be proposed for the relationship between HDIs and p53. It has been reported that TSA up-regulates p53 in endothelial cells (20Kim M.S. Kwon H.J. Lee Y.M. Baek J.H. Jang J.E. Lee S.W. Moon E.J. Kim H.S. Lee S.K. Chung H.Y. Kim C.W. Kim K.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 437-443Google Scholar), whereas HDAC1 can regulate p53 deacetylation, thereby reducing its transcriptional activity by targeting it for degradation (19Juan L.J. Shia W.J. Chen M.H. Yang W.M. Seto E. Lin Y.S. Wu C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20436-20443Google Scholar, 21Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Google Scholar). Therefore, TSA and SAHA might activate p53, thus inducing the expression of p53 target genes involved in apoptosis. Array analysis of gene expression in our cellular system will allow us to better define the mechanism through which p53 regulates the apoptotic susceptibility to HDIs.Interestingly, production of reactive oxygen species is crucial for cell death induced by SAHA (23Ruefli A.A. Ausserlechner M.J. Bernhard D. Sutton V.R. Tainton K.M. Kofler R. Smyth M.J. Johnstone R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10833-10838Google Scholar, 25Butler L.M. Zhou X. Xu W.S. Scher H.I. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11700-11705Google Scholar), and transcription of redox-related genes, formation of reactive oxigen species, and oxidative degradation of mitochondria components have been suggested to be critical for a p53-dependent apoptosis (43Polyak K. Xia Y. Zweier J.L. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Google Scholar). As schematized in Fig.7, we propose a model where the pattern of genes affected by TSA and SAHA can be influenced by the presence of p53 (directly or indirectly), and these genes can regulate the rate of cell death (apoptotic threshold).In conclusion, our findings support the notion that HDI-induced apoptosis requires caspase-9 activation through the release of cytochrome c in a Bcl-2-dependent and p53-sensitive manner. This pathway seems to be common to other anticancer-treatments; however, one difference can be noted when TSA is compared with the DNA-damaging agent daunorubicin in cells lacking caspase-3 activity. Bid, PARP, caspase-2, and -8 processing can still occur in MCF-7/C3CI cells treated with TSA. This suggests that HDIs could effect the rate of caspase activation even when the amplification loop, which is largely based on caspase-3, is defective. Definition of the molecular events that permit overcoming the caspase-3 defect is an interesting question that requires further work. Histone acetyl transferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 are emerging as important components that affect the dynamics of chromatin folding during gene transcription (1Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar). HDACs catalyze the hydrolyisis of acetyl groups from amino-terminal lysine residues of the nucleosomal core histones (1Narlikar G.J. Fan H.Y. Kingston R.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 475-487Google Scholar, 2Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases inhibitors (HDIs) are promising agents for anticancer therapy; they exhibit strong antitumor activities in vivo with low toxicity in preclinical studies. HADC inhibitors belong to a heterogenous class of compounds that includes derivatives of short chain fatty acids, hydroxamic acids, cyclic tetrapetides, and benzamides. Among the hydroxamic acids, trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) are commonly used inhibitors of HDACs (3Melnick A. Licht J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 322-332Google Scholar, 4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Google Scholar). Numerous anti-proliferative effects have been reported for TSA and SAHA, including induction of G0/G2 cell cycle arrest, differentiation, and selective apoptosis of transformed cells (5Medina V. Edmonds B. Young G.P. James R. Appleton S. Zalewski P.D. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3697-3707Google Scholar, 6Richon V.M. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Webb Y. Breslow R. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cordon-Cardo C. Thaler H.T. Rifkind R.A. Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5165-5170Google Scholar). SAHA, in particular, shows strong anti-proliferative effects but low toxicity in vivo and is currently under clinical trials for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors (3Melnick A. Licht J.D. Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2002; 9: 322-332Google Scholar, 4Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 194-202Google Scholar). The cystein proteases, which belong to the family of caspases, play a critical role in the apoptotic response (9Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 459-470Google Scholar, 10Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar, 11Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar). Several anticancer drugs exert their antineoplastic activity by inducing tumor cell apoptosis. Various of these antitumor drugs trigger mitochondrial stress that can lead to apoptosome-mediated caspase-9 activation. Caspase-9 activates the effectors caspase-3 and -7, which then trigger cell fragmentation by cleaving selected death substrates and also process different caspases, thus leading to the generation of the amplification loop (12Adrain C. Martin S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 390-397Google Scholar, 13Wang X. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2922-2933Google Scholar). An alternative apoptotic pathway is triggered by the cell surface death receptor (extrinsic pathway), which includes caspase-8 and caspase-10 as apical caspases (10Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Google Scholar, 11Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Google Scholar, 14Nagata S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 29-55Google Scholar). However by cleaving Bid, a Bcl-2 family member, these caspases can induce mitochondria permeabilization and activation of the amplifier function of the apoptosome (15Bouillet P. Strasser A. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1567-1574Google Scholar). Chemoresistance is frequently caused by aberrant apoptosis that in some instances has been related to defects in caspase activation (16Soengas M.S. Capodieci P. Polsky D. Mora J. Esteller M. Opitz-Araya X. McCombie R. Herman J.G. Gerald W.L. Lazebnik Y.A. Cordon-Cardo C. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2001; 409: 207-211Google Scholar, 17Liu J.R. Opipari A.W. Tan L. Jiang Y. Zhang Y. Tang H. Nunez G. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 924-931Google Scholar). Therefore, the definition of the apoptotic pathway that is induced by a particular anticancer drug is important to design therapeutic trials and clinical treatment. The mechanism of HDI-induced apoptosis has only been marginally addressed. The role of the tumor suppressor p53 in the HDI-triggered apoptosis is not clear. Some reports have suggested an effect of p53 in this apoptotic response (18Sambucetti L.C. Fischer D.D. Zabludoff S. Kwon P.O. Chamberlin H. Trogani N. Xu H. Cohen D. J. Biol.

We provide new insights of Egr1 involvement in proliferation and survival of TRAMP C2 prostate cancer cells by the identification of several new target genes controlling growth, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis such as cyclin D2, P19ink4d, and Fas. Egr1 regulation of these genes, identified by Affymetrix microarray, was confirmed by real-time PCR, immunoblot, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Furthermore we also showed that Egr1 is responsible for cyclin D2 overexpression in tumorigenic DU145 human prostate cells. The regulation of these genes by Egr1 was demonstrated using Egr1 antisense oligonucleotides that further implicated Egr1 in resistance to apoptotic signals. One mechanism was illustrated by the ability of Egr1 to inhibit CD95 (Fas/Apo) expression, leading to insensitivity to FasL. The results provide a mechanistic basis for the oncogenic role of Egr1 in TRAMP C2 prostate cancer cells.

The mortality of this disease is due to metastasis to the bone and lymph nodes. Prostate cancer progression is thought to proceed from multiple defined steps through prostatic intra-epithelial neoplasia, invasive cancer, and progression to androgen-independent and refractory terminal phase (44Nagle R.B. Petein M. Brawer M. Bowden G.T. Cress A.E. J. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 16 (suppl.): 26-29Google Scholar, 50Scher H.I. Heller G. Urology. 2000; 55: 323-327Google Scholar). A large fraction of early onset, and up to 5–107 of all prostate cancer patients, may have an inherited germline mutation that has facilitated the onset of carcinogenesis. However, in the majority of cases, no inherited gene defects are involved, and cancer arises as a result of a series of acquired somatic genetic changes affecting many genes on several chromosomes. Although the molecular mechanism of prostate cancer progression remains largely unknown, a few genes such as E-cadherin, α-catenin, TGF-ॆ,1 and insulin-like growth factors I and II have been shown to be aberrantly expressed and are markers of prostate cancer (34Lamharzi N. Schally A.V. Koppan M. Regul. Pept. 1998; 77: 185-192Google Scholar, 69Wolk A. Mantzoros C.S. Andersson S.O. Bergstrom R. Signorello L.B. Lagiou P. Adami H.O. Trichopoulos D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 911-915Google Scholar). To clearly understand the multistep progression of this disease many other genes remain to be identified. One of the overexpressed genes found in prostate cancer tissue is the transcription factor early growth response gene 1 (Egr1) (18Eid M.A. Kumar M.V. Iczkowski K.A. Bostwick D.G. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2461-2468Google Scholar, 62Thigpen A.E. Cala K.M. Guileyardo J.M. Molberg K.H. McConnell J.D. Russell D.W. J. Urol. 1996; 155: 975-981Google Scholar). This gene could have an important function because its expression level increases with the degree of malignancy as measured by the Gleason grade of the tumor (18Eid M.A. Kumar M.V. Iczkowski K.A. Bostwick D.G. Tindall D.J. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2461-2468Google Scholar). This seems to be specific to prostate tumor cells, because in mammary and lung tumors, as well as most normal tissues, Egr1 expression is low. Egr1 overexpression is correlated with the loss of its co-repressor NAB2 in primary prostate carcinoma. This disruption of the balance between Egr1 and NAB2 expression results in a high Egr1 transcriptional activity in prostate carcinoma cells (1Abdulkadir S.A. Carbone J.M. Naughton C.K. Humphrey P.A. Catalona W.J. Milbrandt J. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 935-939Google Scholar). A recent study based on the cross breeding of Egr1−/− mice with TRAMP mice showed significantly delayed prostate tumor formation in the Egr1-deficient TRAMP mouse compared with TRAMP-Egr1+/+ mice (2Abdulkadir S.A. Qu Z. Garabedian E. Song S.K. Peters T.J. Svaren J. Carbone J.M. Naughton C.K. Catalona W.J. Ackerman J.J. Gordon J.I. Humphrey P.A. Milbrandt J. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 101-107Google Scholar). The TRAMP mouse is a well known model of prostate cancer (20Foster B.A. Gingrich J.R. Kwon E.D. Madias C. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3325-3330Google Scholar) in which tumors progress to metastases in a window from 8 to 24 weeks of age. Although Egr1 loss did not appear to prevent tumor initiation, Egr1 deficiency delayed the progression of prostate tumors in these mice. Significantly, several gene products associated with aggressive prostate cancer such as TGF-ॆ and insulin-like growth factor II (37Liu C. Adamson E. Mercola D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11831-11836Google Scholar, 60Svaren J. Ehrig T. Abdulkadir S.A. Ehrengruber M.U. Watson M.A. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38524-38531Google Scholar) have been identified as regulated by Egr1. These observations strongly suggest that Egr1 is involved in prostate cancer progression despite its known role as a tumor-suppressor in several other types of human cancers (29Huang R. Fan Y. de Belle I. Niemeyer C. Gottardis M. Mercola D. Adamson E. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 102-109Google Scholar). In this present study on the role of Egr1, we have used the tumorigenic C2 prostate cancer cell line which was established from a prostate tumor from a single TRAMP mouse tumor. These tumorigenic cells express a high constitutive level of Egr1 protein. Transcriptional regulation by Egr1 was assessed using Affymetrix array technology. The unique step used here was to perform a microarray analysis using cells rendered deficient in Egr1 as the comparison sample for the identification of Egr1 target genes, in prostate cancer cells. The results provide new insight into the involvement of endogenous Egr1 in proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells by the identification of several new target genes specifically controlling growth, cell cycle progression, and the apoptosis pathway. C2 TRAMP cells were grown as described elsewhere (20Foster B.A. Gingrich J.R. Kwon E.D. Madias C. Greenberg N.M. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3325-3330Google Scholar). The cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes at a density of 100,000 cells per well 1 day before transfection. The transfection was performed as described by the manufacturer with the GenePorter reagent (16 ॖl) (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc, San Diego, CA) and 0.1 ॖm antisense oligonucleotide (AS or ctl). Sequences of the AS and mismatch control oligonucleotide (ctl) were used as described (65Virolle T. Adamson E.D. Baron V. Birle D. Mercola D. Mustelin T. de Belle I. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1124-1128Google Scholar). The sequence of ctl oligonucleotide corresponds to AS sequence with 4 bases mutated. One day before transfection the cells were seeded in duplicate into 35-mm dishes at a density of 70,000 cells per dish. At day 0 cells were transfected as described above. 4 h later the cells were harvested for counting and for protein and total mRNA extraction. This procedure was repeated each day after transfection according to a time course from day 0 to day 6. The day after transfection, the cells were ultraviolet-C (UVC) irradiated (40 J/m2) in a Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) or treated with 100 ng/ml of Fas L recombinant protein (Oncogene Research Products, Darmstadt, Germany). One or two days after UVC irradiation or 9 and 18 h after Fas L treatment, detached and trypsinized cells were pooled and incubated with 0.27 trypan blue to determine the percentage of dead cells. C2 cells were transfected as described above. After 16 h the cells were counted and seeded into 6 well plates (200 cells/well) in RPMI medium with 0.1 ॖm of antisense oligonucleotide. After 8 days incubation at 37 °C, the colonies were stained with 27 crystal violet. The protocol recommended by Affymetrix (www.affymetrix.com) was used for mRNA quality control and gene expression analysis from C2 cells transfected either with AS or ctl oligonucleotides. The probes were hybridized to Affymetrix MGU75Av2 arrays representing ∼12,000 mouse transcripts. Detailed protocols for data analysis and documentation of the sensitivity, reproducibility, and other aspects of the quantitative microarray analysis using Affymetrix technology were used as reported previously (39Lockhart D.J. Dong H. Byrne M.C. Follettie M.T. Gallo M.V. Chee M.S. Mittmann M. Wang C. Kobayashi M. Horton H. Brown E.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 1675-1680Google Scholar). mRNA expression level was quantified by real-time one-step RT-PCR using the LightCycler-RNA-Amplification Kit SYBR Green I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A standard curve from several dilutions of a sample of total RNA was established to calculate the relative amount of each gene. Values were then normalized to the relative amounts of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase determined from a similar standard curve. Each gene was amplified using the appropriate specific primers (sequences available upon request). For the Western blot analysis, proteins were blocked and reacted with antibodies to Egr1 (C19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), mouse and human cyclin D2 (sc-593 and sc-181, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), p19ink4d (sc-1063, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or CD95 (anti-mouse Fas/TNFRSF6 (CD95) antibody, R & D Systems, Inc., Minneapolis, MN). To cross-link protein on DNA targets the cells were incubated in 17 formaldehyde at 4 °C during 30 min. After extraction as described elsewhere (13de Belle I. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 162-169Google Scholar), the chromatin was fragmented by sonication to obtain an average size of 1.5-kb DNA fragment. The DNA fragments mix was then immunoprecipitated using a specific Egr1 antibody and a non-immune serum as a negative control. After cross-link reversal as described elsewhere (13de Belle I. Mercola D. Adamson E.D. BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 162-169Google Scholar), the screening for identification of the regulatory sequence of captured Egr1 target genes was performed by PCR using the following primers located in the 5′ regulatory sequences of the following genes: p19ink4d, 5′-ctggtcgctgcacgctgac-3′ (forward) and 5′-agtggataccggtggactgt-3′ (reverse) (−599 and −1, respectively, from the ATG); cyclin D2, 5′-ggcgagctgaggagagccg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctccatagccagccggcca-3′ (reverse) (−269 and +6, respectively, from the ATG); cyclin G2, 5′-ccagcatcccccaagctact-3′ (forward) and 5′-cttcatctgcagcaaatacacc-3′ (reverse) (−601 and +6, respectively, from the ATG); Mad, 5′-aagcggccggtggcccgc-3′ (forward) and 5′-gctgtcgccatcctgcacc-3′ (reverse) (-48 and +11, respectively, from the ATG); CD95, 5′-cagtggtgagtcagtgggttt-3′ (forward) and 5′-gacagcccagatccacagcat-3′ (reverse) (−272 and +345, respectively, from the ATG). Genomic DNA input was used as a control for the amplification efficiency of each primers pair. Non-immune immunoprecipitated DNA and DNA immunoprecipitated from AS-transfected C2 cells were used as negative controls. The amplified products were resolved on 2.77 agarose gel. To examine the functional significance of Egr1 overexpression in prostate cancer cells, we inhibited its expression using an AS in TRAMP C2 prostate cancer cells. To assess the efficiency and the specificity of AS, we performed Western blot analyses of the protein expression of Egr1 and other Egr family members, Egr2, Egr3, and wt1, 24 h after transfection of the antisense and control oligonucleotides (Fig. 1A). As seen in Fig. 1A, the antisense oligonucleotide strongly decreased Egr1 expression, while there was no effect on Egr2 and WT1 expression. Egr3 seems to be slightly increased when Egr1 was inhibited. In contrast, the ctl did not alter the protein expression pattern of the cells. These results demonstrated that a 24-h treatment with a low concentration, 0.1 ॖm, of the AS oligonucleotide efficiently and specifically inhibited Egr1 expression. To examine the time course of Egr1 inhibition in C2 cells, proteins were extracted each day for 6 days following AS transfection of antisense and control oligonucleotide-treated cells. Egr1 expression in the presence of AS was undetectable from day 1 to day 3, became detectable on day 4, and was fully restored on day 5 to day 6 (Fig.1B, top panel). As expected, the use of the ctl did not change Egr1 expression level (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). These results show that AS is stable enough over 3 days to allow almost complete and specific inhibition of Egr1 expression for a prolonged period following a single treatment. To determine the involvement of Egr1 in the proliferation rate of C2 cells, the growth of the cells in which Egr1 expression was inhibited by AS oligonucleotide (C2-AS) was compared with the control corresponding to C2 cells transfected with control oligonucleotide (C2-ctl). Briefly the cells were transfected at day 0 with either AS or ctl and the proliferation rate was directly assessed every day until day 6 by cell counting (Fig. 2A). As seen in Fig. 2A, the proliferation rate of C2-AS cells was strongly reduced during the first 3 days after transfection and started to rise again on day 4. Between day 4 and 5 the slope of the proliferation curve was approximately equal to the slope of the control (C2-ctl cells), indicating that the cells recovered their expected proliferation rate (Fig. 2A). The proliferation time course was well correlated to the pattern of Egr1 inhibition seen in Fig.1B. Indeed, as long as Egr1 expression was inhibited, the proliferation rate of C2 cells was markedly reduced and then resumed as soon as Egr1 expression recovered. In addition, comparison between C2-AS and C2-ctl cells in a colony forming assay showed 747 fewer colonies in C2-AS (average of 32 colonies (±6) for C2-ctlversus 8.3 colonies (±3) for C2-AS), suggesting that the tumorigenicity of the cells may decrease when Egr1 is inhibited (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, cell cycle analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, performed at day 2 after transfection, showed fewer cells (about 117 less) in the G1 phase of C2-ctl cells than C2-AS cells (data not shown). The sum of results strongly argue in favor of a role for Egr1 in the control of growth and cell cycle progression in prostate cancer cells. To determine the genes that are involved in Egr1-mediated transformation, comparative analyses of mRNA populations from C2 cells 1 day after transfection with AS or with ctl oligonucleotide were performed using Affymetrix microarray hybridization. Affymetrix analysis revealed a large number of genes (at least 180) involved in the control of proliferation, death, and malignant progression. Most of these had not previously been identified as part of an Egr1 signaling pathway. Although many genes are direct Egr1 target genes, others could be indirectly regulated by Egr1 or modulated after the change of the physiological behavior of the cells due to the inhibition of Egr1 expression. However it is important to consider that those genes could be as important as the direct target genes to maintain, potentiate, or regulate Egr1 effect. Genes displaying the highest Affymetrix expression changes upon treatment with AS are listed in TableI.Table IAffymetrix analysis of genes regulated in C2 cells that express Egr1 constitutively compared with antisense treated cellsDown-regulated by Egr1GeneRatioFunctionProstate CA linkEgr1 target geneSAA3 (serum amyloid A 3)43.2Inhibition of proliferation (53Shainkin-Kestenbaum R.

To confirm the Affymetrix microarray analysis results, the expression of some genes listed in Table I was independently tested by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. In these experiments, total RNA extracts from Egr1 expressing and non-expressing C2 cells were used as templates. The -fold induction/repression calculated from real-time RT-PCR assays compared with the corresponding ratio determined in the Affymetrix analysis (Table II), produced remarkable concordance. The induction or repression of specific target genes by Egr1 was in the same direction in all cases examined and commonly exhibited a similar degree of change. Indeed, the Pearson correlation coefficient of the Affymetrix and real-time PCR results was 0.78, which is significant (p = 0.008, χ2). These results confirm the reliability of the Affymetrix analysis.Table IIComparison of Affymetrix array with real-time RT-PCR ratio for mRNA levelsGeneAffymetrix ratioReal-time PCR ratioSAA343.272.7 ± 12.87GBP134.25.3 ± 0.44p19ink4d12.32.1 ± 0.22Mad9.44.6 ± 0.95IκBα8.68.2 ± 0.38Cyclin G25.62.7 ± 0.56CD954.94.4 ± 0.63RB-like 242.0 ± 0.26TIS11−16.7−3.3 ± 0.66DNA-I-like 2−6−6.6 ± 0.50Gα12−4.4−7.6 ± 0.71Cyclin D2−4.3−9.1 ± 1.23Changes in the expression level of several Egr1 target genes given in Table I were independently tested using quantitative RT-PCR analysis of RNA from C2-ctl and C2-AS treated cells.

Furthermore, several genes identified here, have been directly linked to human prostate cancer. Indeed, inhibitor κBα (IκBα) was shown in several prostate cancer cell lines to inhibit growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis by inhibition of NF-κB activity (31Huang S. Pettaway C.A. Uehara H.

https://openalex.org/W2001181621,"Medulloblastoma is a malignant, invasive embryonal tumour of the cerebellum which manifests preferentially in children. A subset of cases is associated with colon cancer and APC germline mutations (Turcot syndrome), and APC and beta-catenin point mutations occur in up to 10% of sporadic cases, indicating the involvement of the Wnt pathway in the development of medulloblastoma. In 39 sporadic cerebellar medulloblastomas screeened for alterations in the AXIN1 gene, another component of the Wnt pathway, we found missense AXIN1 mutations in two tumours, CCC-->TCC at codon 255 (exon 1, Pro-->Ser) and TCT-->TGT at codon 263 (exon 1, Ser-->Cys). Furthermore, the A allele at the G/A polymorphism at nucleotide 16 in intron 4 was significantly over-represented in medulloblastomas (39 cases; G 0.76 vs-A 0.24) compared to healthy individuals (86 cases; G 0.91 vs A 0.09; P=0.0027). RT-PCR revealed large deletions in the AXIN1 gene in 5/12 (42%) medulloblastomas, consistent with a previous report. However, we observed such deletions at a similar frequency also in normal brain tissue (6/12, 50%). Since there are multiple complementary, inverted sequences present in the AXIN1 gene, these large deletions may represent RT-PCR errors due to stem-loop secondary structures."

Although we reported previously that PGE2 inhibited gastric irritant-induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation in primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells, we show here that PGE2 inhibits the ethanol-dependent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Of the four main subtypes of PGE2 receptors, we also demonstrated, using subtype-specific agonists, that EP2 and EP4 receptors are involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis. Activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors is coupled with an increase in cAMP, for which a cAMP analogue was found here to inhibit the ethanol-induced apoptosis. The increase in cAMP is known to activate both protein kinase A (PKA) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathways. An inhibitor of PKA but not of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocked the PGE2-mediated protection of cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis, suggesting that a PKA pathway is mainly responsible for the PGE2-mediated inhibition of apoptosis. Based on these results, we considered that PGE2 inhibited gastric irritant-induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells via induction of an increase in cAMP and activation of PKA, and that this effect was involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of the gastric mucosa from gastric irritants in vivo.

PGs, especially PGE2, also have strong cytoprotective effects on the gastric mucosa as a consequence of various indirect mechanisms that include increased epithelial mucus production and bicarbonate secretion (2Keogh J.P.

Gastroenterology. 1986; 91: 1415-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In contrast, it is still unclear as to whether or not PGE2 directly protects gastric mucosal cells from various gastric irritants. Gastropathy, such as gastric ulcer and gastritis, is caused by damage to the gastric mucosa due to its exposure to various gastric irritants such as ethanol and acids. It appears that these gastric irritants damage the gastric mucosa by inducing not only necrosis but also apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells (9Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1092-G1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, a stimulated rate of apoptosis of gastric mucosal cells was reported at the onset of gastric ulceration (10Konturek P.C. Brzozowski T. Konturek S.J. Pajdo R. Konturek J.E. Kwiecien S. Taut A. Hahn E.G. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1999; 50: 211-225PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis associated withHelicobacter pylori infection was suggested to be involved in the development of atrophic gastritis caused by H. pyloriinfection (11Moss S.F. Calam J. Agarwal B. Wang S. Holt P.R. Gut. 1996; 38: 498-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). We recently reproduced such gastric irritant-induced apoptosis in vitro by using primary cultures of guinea pig gastric mucosal cells. Various gastric irritants (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrochloric acid) induced apoptotic DNA fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and caspase activation (9Tomisato W.

We also found that these gastric irritants induced apoptosis through a common pathway in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role (13Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to examine the direct cytoprotective effect of PGE2 on gastric mucosal cells, we investigated previously the effect of PGE2 on this gastric irritant-induced apoptosis in cultured guinea pig gastric mucosal cells, and we found that PGE2inhibited the apoptosis caused by various gastric irritants (ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrochloric acid) (15Hoshino T. Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism governing this inhibitory effect of PGE2 on apoptosis has, however, yet to be elucidated. For example, although PGE2receptors have been pharmacologically subdivided into four main subtypes (EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4) (16Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar), the EP subtype involved in the PGE2-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells has not been revealed. In this study, we examine the molecular mechanism of this PGE2-mediated inhibition of ethanol-induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells, and we suggest that PGE2 inhibits gastric irritant-induced apoptosis through EP2- and EP4-mediated increases in cAMP and activation of protein kinase A (PKA).

Male guinea pigs (4 weeks of age) were purchased from Shimizu Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). All experiments and procedures described here were approved by the Animal Care Committee of Okayama University. Gastric mucosal cells were isolated from guinea pig fundic glands as described previously (17Rokutan K. Yamada M. Torigoe J. Saito T. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G526-G533PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated gastric mucosal cells (1 × 106 cells/dish) were cultured for 48 h in RPMI 1640 containing 0.3% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in type I collagen-coated plastic culture plates (Iwaki) under the conditions of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. After removing non-adherent cells by washing with RPMI 1640, cells that were attached to the plate at about 50% confluence were used. Guinea pig gastric mucosal cell preparations cultured under these conditions have been characterized previously (17Rokutan K. Yamada M. Torigoe J. Saito T. Am. J.

Cells were preincubated with PGE2 for 2 h and were then exposed to ethanol by replacement of the entire bathing medium with fresh medium containing ethanol and the same concentration of PGE2. For monitoring cell viability, cells were incubated with MTT solution at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 2 h. Isopropyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid were added to the cells at final concentrations of 50% and 20 mm, respectively. The absorbance of each sample at 570 nm was determined by a spectrophotometer using a reference wavelength of 630 nm (19Wolf B.B. Green D.R. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mmKCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT). Suspensions were sonicated and centrifuged, after which the supernatants were incubated with fluorogenic peptide substrates (Ac-DEVD-MCA (caspase-3), Ac-IETD-MCA (caspase-8), and Ac-LEHD-MCA (caspase-9)) in reaction buffer (100 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 10% sucrose, 0.1% CHAPS, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 15 min at 37 °C. The release of aminomethylcoumarin (AMC) was determined using a fluorescence spectrophotometer. One unit of protease activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required for releasing 1 pmol of AMC/min. Pro-caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 cleavage was monitored by immunoblotting with specific antibodies against these caspases. Cell lysates (20 μg of protein) were applied to 12 (for caspase-3 and actin detection) or 8% (for caspase-8 and caspase-9 detection) polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and subjected to electrophoresis, and then proteins were immunoblotted with the anti-caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, or actin antibody. After ethanol treatment, cells were washed in fractionation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 20 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 8.0), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA) and resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. After homogenization on ice using a tight fitting Dounce homogenizer, nuclei were spun down at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was further spun at 14,000 rpm for 25 min for separation into cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. The mitochondrial fraction was then resuspended in buffer D (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05% SDS). Protein concentrations in these fractions were determined by the Bradford method. Samples (4 μg) were applied to 15% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS and subjected to electrophoresis, and then proteins were immunoblotted with the anti-cytochrome c or anti-actin antibody. All values are expressed as the means ± S.E. A Student's t test for unpaired results was performed for the evaluation of differences between the groups. Differences were considered to be significant for values ofp < 0.05. We reported previously (15Hoshino T. Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis.

In this study, conditions were changed slightly for inducing apoptosis in that gastric mucosal cells were incubated with 4% ethanol for 6 h. Fig.1 shows that PGE2 inhibited ethanol-induced apoptosis under these conditions. In this way, PGE2 (0.1–10 μm) attenuated an ethanol-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 1). In this experiment, cells were first incubated with PGE2(preincubation step) and then with ethanol in the presence of the same concentration of PGE2 (incubation step). We confirmed that PGE2 must be present in both steps in order to inhibit efficiently the ethanol-induced apoptosis (data not shown), as described previously (15Hoshino T. Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This method of PGE2 treatment was thus used in all subsequent experiments. We reported previously (13Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that various gastric irritants activated caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 in gastric mucosal cells. We also reported that PGE2 suppressed the ethanol-mediated activation of caspase-3 (15Hoshino T. Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We therefore examined here the effect of PGE2 on the activation of various caspases, including caspase-3, where caspase activities were examined by the use of fluorogenic peptide substrates (Ac-DEVD-MCA (for caspase-3), Ac-IETD-MCA (for caspase-8), and Ac-LEHD-MCA (for caspase-9)). Since these peptides can be cleaved by other caspases (for example, caspase-7 can recognize and cleave Ac-DEVD-MCA) (21Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Timkey T. Garcia-Calvo M.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3768) Google Scholar), it is more appropriate to describe our findings in terms of caspase-3-, caspase-8-, or caspase-9-like activity, instead of caspase-3, caspase-8, or caspase-9 activity, respectively. Ethanol treatment clearly activated all of the caspases tested (Fig. 2A), as has been found previously (13Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PGE2 suppressed the activation of not only caspase-3-like activity but also that of caspase-9- and caspase-8-like activities (Fig. 2A). By employing immunoblotting experiments, using specific antibodies against these caspases, we observed pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-8, and pro-caspase-9 cleavage by ethanol treatment (Fig. 2B), as has been found previously (13Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PGE2 suppressed the cleavage of each of all these pro-caspases (Fig. 2B). The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria activates caspase-9 in collaboration with Apaf-1 (23Cain K. Bratton S.B.

Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that various gastric irritants, including ethanol, stimulated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Therefore, PGE2–mediated suppression of ethanol-induced activation of caspase-9-like activity (Fig. 3) suggests that PGE2 inhibits the ethanol-stimulated release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. We therefore examined the effect of PGE2 on the ethanol-dependent release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. As shown in Fig. 3, the amount of cytochromec in the cytosolic or mitochondrial fraction was increased or decreased, respectively, by the ethanol treatment, suggesting that ethanol stimulated the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. In the presence of PGE2, however, the ethanol-induced release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria was inhibited (Fig. 3). Therefore, it would appear that the target of PGE2 for inhibiting apoptosis is located upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction in the ethanol-induced apoptosis pathway. Although the inhibition of ethanol-induced caspase-9 activation by PGE2 was partial (Fig. 2), that of release of cytochrome c was almost complete (Fig. 3), suggesting that the ethanol-induced apoptosis partially involves cytochromec-independent activation of caspase-9, which was reported recently (24Morishima N.

Dinh T.H. Newton D.L. Rybak S.M. Magun B.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1983-1994PubMed Google Scholar) in other cell types. PGE2 receptors have been pharmacologically subdivided into four main subtypes, EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4 (16Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). We used agonists specific for each EP receptor in order to identify EP receptors involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis. Both ONO-AE1-259-01 (an EP2agonist) and ONO-AE1-329 (an EP4 agonist) suppressed the ethanol-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig.4, B and D). The extent of the suppression was similar to that achieved by PGE2 (Fig. 1). We also found that each of these agonists suppressed the ethanol-mediated activation of caspase-3-, caspase-8-, and caspase-9-like activities to much the same extent as did PGE2 (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, each of these agonists suppressed the cleavage of pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-8, and pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 5B). Based on findings reported previously (26Suzawa T. Miyaura C. Inada M. Maruyama T. Sugimoto Y. Ushikubi F. Ichikawa A. Narumiya S. Suda T. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1554-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using these agonists (ONO-AE1-259-01 and ONO-AE1-329), it is reasonable to postulate that, for the concentrations of each of them used in the experiments described in Figs. 4 and 5, they act as specific agonists for the EP2 or EP4 receptor. On the other hand, neither ONO-DI-004 (an EP1 agonist) nor ONO-NT-012 (an EP3 agonist) suppressed the ethanol-induced decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4, A and C). We also found that neither of these agonists suppressed the ethanol-mediated activation of caspase-3-, caspase-8-, and caspase-9-like activities (Fig. 5A) and ethanol-mediated cleavage of pro-caspase-3, pro-caspase-8, and pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 5B). On the evidence presented in previous papers (4Suzuki K. Araki H. Mizoguchi H. Furukawa O. Takeuchi K. Digestion. 2001; 63: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Suzawa T. Miyaura C.

Consequently, the results provided in Figs. 4 and 5 suggest that EP2 and EP4 but not EP1 and EP3 receptors are involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis.Figure 5Effects of EP receptor agonists on ethanol-induced caspase activation. Cultured gastric mucosal cells were preincubated with ONO-DI-004 (EP1 agonist; 10 μm), ONO-AE1-259-01 (EP2 agonist; 1 μm), ONO-NT-012 (EP3 agonist; 1 μm), ONO-AE1-329 (EP4 agonist; 1 μm), or PGE2 (1 μm) for 2 h and then further incubated for 6 h with 4% ethanol (EtOH) in the presence of the same concentration of each agonist or PGE2 as that used in the preincubation step. Cell lysates were prepared, and caspase-3-, -8-, or -9-like activities were measured by a fluorometric assay using Ac-DEVD-MCA, Ac-IETD-MCA, and Ac-LEHD-MCA, respectively. One unit of protease activity was the amount of enzyme required for releasing 1 pmol of AMC/min. Values are means ± S.D.; n = 3. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 (A). Pro-caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9 cleavage was monitored by immunoblotting with specific antibodies against these caspases. The relative intensity of each band to control was shown. For control experiment, the amount of actin in each sample was monitored (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The intracellular signaling pathways differ among the various EP receptor subtypes; EP1 is coupled to Ca2+ mobilization, whereas EP3 receptor activation inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, in contrast to EP2 and EP4 receptor activation in which adenylate cyclase activity is stimulated (16Coleman R.A. Smith W.L. Narumiya S. Pharmacol. Rev. 1994; 46: 205-229PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the results described above suggest that stimulation of adenylate cyclase activity (increase in cAMP) is involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, a cAMP analogue, pCPT-cAMP, was used. As shown in Fig. 6, pCPT-cAMP attenuated the ethanol-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. The concentration of pCPT-cAMP required for expressing this activity was much the same as that for other cAMP-dependent phenomena (28Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Webster C.R. Usechak P. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: G727-G738Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 30Rideout H.J. Larsen K.E. Sulzer D. Stefanis L. J. Neurochem. 2001; 78: 899-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that activation of adenylate cyclase coupled with activation of EP2 and EP4 receptors plays an important role in the signal transduction mechanism associated with the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis. The increase in cAMP then activates two types of kinase, PKA and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), that are important for various signal transduction mechanisms related to apoptosis (31Li J. Yang S. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13026-13034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). On this basis, we next examined the involvement of these kinases in the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis, using an inhibitor for each kinase. H-89 (an inhibitor of PKA) blocked the PGE2-mediated protection of cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7A). It is reasonable to consider that H-89 used in the experimental results described in Fig. 7A acts as a specific inhibitor for PKA based on the results of previous papers where similar concentrations of this inhibitor were used (32Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). H-89, at the concentrations used in the experimental results shown in Fig. 7A, did not affect cell viability in the absence of ethanol and PGE2 or in the presence of ethanol only (data not shown). On the other hand, wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3K) did not affect the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis (Fig. 7B). Higher concentrations of wortmannin (more than 20 nm) showed toxicity in the absence of ethanol (data not shown). Based on previous papers (33Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R. Ashendel C. Zalkow L. Matter W.F. Dodge J. Grindey G. Vlahos C.J. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2419-2423PubMed Google Scholar) where wortmannin was used, the concentrations of this drug used in the experiments described here should have been enough to inhibit PI3K. Therefore, it seems that PKA rather than PI3K is involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells. A number of clinically used anti-ulcer drugs are related in their action to achieving increased intracellular levels of PGE2. Furthermore, NSAIDs, one of the major causes of gastric ulcers, are thought to damage the gastric mucosa by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and decreasing the levels of circulating PGE2 at the gastric mucosa. Therefore, it is clear that PGE2 is one of the most important protective factors for the gastric mucosa in vivo. PGE2 protects the gastric mucosa both directly and indirectly. Compared with indirect PGE2-protective mechanisms, the mechanism of the direct protection is relatively unclear. For example, EP receptors involved in the indirect protection of the gastric mucosa by PGE2 have been revealed as follows: inhibition of gastric motility and stimulation of bicarbonate secretion by PGE2 are mediated by EP1 receptor (34Takeuchi K. Yagi K. Kato S. Ukawa H. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Watabe A. Sugimoto Y. Honda A. Irie A. Namba T. Negishi M. Ito S. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20175-20178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); the stimulation of mucin production by PGE2 is mediated by EP4 receptor (36Hassan S. Kinoshita Y. Min D. Nakata H. Kishi K. Matsushima Y. Asahara M. Wang H.Y. Okada A. Maekawa T. Matsui H. Chiba T. Digestion. 1996; 57: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); the increase in gastric mucosal blood flow by PGE2 is mediated by EP3receptor (37Araki H. Ukawa H. Sugawa Y. Yagi K. Suzuki K. Takeuchi K. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14 Suppl. 1: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); and inhibition of acid secretion by PGE2 is mediated by EP2/EP3 receptors (5Yokotani K. Okuma Y. Osumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 653-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 38Naribayashi-Inomoto Y. Ding M. Nakata H. Narumiya S. Sugimoto Y. Honda A. Ichikawa A. Chiba T. Kinoshita Y. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, at the present time we have had no concrete evidence as to the role of EP receptors in the direct protection of the gastric mucosa by PGE2. In a continuation of our previous work (15Hoshino T. Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that showed that PGE2 inhibited gastric irritant-induced apoptosis in primary cultures of gastric mucosal cells, we examined this phenomenon here in order to understand the underlying molecular mechanism of the direct protection of the gastric mucosa by PGE2. By using agonists specific for each receptor, we have identified that both EP2 and EP4 receptors are involved in the PGE2-mediated protection of gastric mucosal cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis. Relating this to our conclusions, it was recently reported (39Houchen C.W. Sturmoski M.A. Anant S. Breyer R.M. Stenson W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G490-G498Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that inhibition of irradiation-induced apoptosis by PGE2 in intestinal epithelium of the jejunum was mediated by the EP2 receptor, using a knockout mouse of this receptor. Since we reported previously that all gastric irritants tested (NSAIDs, ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and hydrochloric acid) induced apoptosis through a common pathway in which mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role (9Tomisato W. Tsutsumi S. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1092-G1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Takano T. Rokutan K. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 168-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we assumed that PGE2 inhibited apoptosis by these gastric irritants other than ethanol through EP2 and EP4 receptors. Therefore, it appears that PGE2 protects the gastric mucosa by various mechanisms (both direct and indirect) via different EP receptors. The conclusion arrived at above is apparently not consistent with some previous reports. The expression of EP receptors in the gastrointestinal tract of mouse has been examined by in situhybridization studies where it was shown that the expression of EP4 mRNA could be detected in gastric mucosal cells; however, expression of EP2 mRNA was not detected in any types of cells from the stomach by this method (40Morimoto K. Sugimoto Y. Katsuyama M. Oida H. Tsuboi K. Kishi K. Kinoshita Y. Negishi M. Chiba T. Narumiya S. Ichikawa A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G681-G687PubMed Google Scholar). We consider that this experiment cannot exclude the possibility that EP2 is weakly expressed in gastric mucosal cells, because it was recently reported (39Houchen C.W. Sturmoski M.A. Anant S. Breyer R.M. Stenson W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: G490-G498Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) that EP2 is expressed in the stomach of the mouse, using RNase protection assay. Furthermore, it was recently found that the gene encoding EP2 is inducible in macrophages; EP2 mRNA was detected only after a change of medium or following the addition of LPS to the medium (41Ikegami R. Sugimoto Y. Segi E. Katsuyama M. Karahashi H. Amano F. Maruyama T. Yamane H. Tsuchiya S. Ichikawa A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 4689-4696Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is also possible that an unknown stimulus under our culture conditions induces EP2 mRNA expression. In such a case, the anti-apoptotic activity of PGE2 in normal gastric mucosa may be mainly mediated by EP4, whereas EP2 could be involved in such activity only in the presence of pathological conditions such as gastritis. Unfortunately, genes encoding the EP receptors in guinea pig have not been cloned, meaning that these possibilities cannot be further examined at present. It has been reported that the EP1 receptor is mainly responsible for the gastro-protective effect of PGE2in vivo through the inhibition of gastric motility (37Araki H. Ukawa H. Sugawa Y. Yagi K. Suzuki K. Takeuchi K. Aliment. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 14 Suppl. 1: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 42Takeuchi K. Araki H. Umeda M. Komoike Y. Suzuki K. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 1160-1165PubMed Google Scholar). In these reports, the authors examined an acute phase of gastric lesions (1 h after administration of high doses of gastric irritants), suggesting that they damaged gastric mucosal cells mainly through necrosis (not apoptosis). We reported previously (15Hoshino T. Takano T. Tsutsumi S. Tomisato W. Tsuchiya T. Mizushima T. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2002; 47: 2370-2379Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that gastric irritant-induced apoptosis, but not necrosis, was inhibited by PGE2 in cultured gastric mucosal cells. Therefore, we consider that PGE2 protects the gastric mucosa from necrosis via an EP1-mediated inhibition of gastric motility and from apoptosis via an EP2/EP4-mediated direct inhibition of apoptosis. We have also revealed here a part of the intracellular signal transduction pathway for the PGE2-mediated protection of cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis in gastric mucosal cells. By using a cAMP analogue and inhibitors for PKA and PI3K, we propose that PGE2-activated EP2/EP4 receptors stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, thus increasing cAMP, which then activates PKA and brings about an inhibition of apoptosis. Inhibition of apoptosis by cAMP has been reported for various cell types (43Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E.

J. 2000; 349: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated BAD is inert for inhibiting Bcl-2, and Bcl-2 can suppress release of cytochromec from mitochondria (50Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2233) Google Scholar). Therefore, activation of PKA by PGE2 in our system may phosphorylate BAD, which could then explain the PGE2-mediated suppression of ethanol-induced release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 3). However, since we could not detect the band of phosphorylated BAD in guinea pig gastric mucosal cells using antibodies directed against phosphorylated human BAD (data not shown), we are unable to be certain of this point at this time. Alternatively, since PKA was reported to induce Bcl-2 expression via activation of cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (51Chen W. Yu Y.L. Lee S.F. Chiang Y.J. Chao J.R. Huang J.H. Chiong J.H. Huang C.J. Lai M.Z. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4636-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the PGE2-mediated protection of cells from ethanol-induced apoptosis is explained by this mechanism.

Two cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p40phox and p47phox, contain PX domains.

To delineate the mechanisms by which these PX domains interact with PI-containing membranes, we measured the membrane binding of these domains and respective mutants by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer techniques and also calculated the electrostatic potentials of the domains as a function of PI binding. Results indicate that membrane binding of both PX domains is initiated by nonspecific electrostatic interactions, which is followed by the membrane penetration of hydrophobic residues.

Since the discovery of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain as an effector for PIs, many PI-binding domains, including FYVE (Fablp,YOTB, Vac1p, and EEA1), ENTH (epsin N-terminalhomology), FERM (four-point one,ezrin, radixin, moesin), and PX (Phox) domains, with different PI specificities and affinities have been identified. The PX domain was initially identified as a conserved structural module of about 130 amino acids in the p40phox and p47phox subunits of the NADPH oxidase complex (1Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2353-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The PX domain has been since found in over 100 eukaryotic proteins (2Sato T.K. Overduin M. Emr S.D.

NADPH oxidase is a multisubunit protein complex consisting of cytosolic components p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac as well as a membrane-bound heterodimer of p22phox and gp91phox. When invasive microorganisms are sequestered, the cytosolic subunits translocate to the membrane surface and fuse with the membrane-bound subunits, creating the activated complex (15Babior B.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 1464-1476Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Activated NADPH oxidase then produces superoxide, which in turn generates microbicidal reactive oxygen species in phagocytic vesicles. Chronic granulomatous disease, which confers severe susceptibility to infection, is due to naturally occurring mutations in the NADPH oxidase complex, including some in the p47phox subunit. p47phox is a prerequisite for assembly of the entire complex (16Cross A.R. Erickson R.W. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15519-15525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Diebold B.A. Bokoch G.M. Nat.

Paclet M.H. El Benna J. Pocidalo M.A. Morel F. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both p40phox and p47phox contain PX domains. The recently determined x-ray crystal structures of these PX domains (7Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T.

However, the PI-dependent membrane-binding mechanisms of these PX domains as well as their roles in NADPH oxidase activation are relatively poorly understood. Evidence indicates that these PX domains have distinct membrane binding properties. For instance, the p47phox-PX has a unique secondary binding site that nonspecifically binds anionic phospholipids, including phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) and phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). Furthermore, the p40phox-PX was shown to be localized at PtdIns(3)P-rich endosomes when expressed ectopically in mammalian cells (7Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D.

This study was undertaken to determine the origin of differential membrane targeting mechanisms of p40phox-PX and p47phox-PX, with an emphasis on elucidating the roles of PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,4)P2 in their membrane binding. Results from in vitro membrane binding measurements by monolayer and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analyses, electrostatic potential computation, and subcellular localization measurements using enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged domains provide new insight into how differently PtdIns(3)P and PtdIns(3,4)P2mediate the membrane targeting of p40phox-PX and p47phox-PX, respectively, which in turn provide an important clue to the understanding of the membrane recruitment mechanisms of p40phox and p47phox subunits of NADPH oxidase. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (POPA), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine (POPS), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1,2-Dipalmitoyl derivatives of PtdIns(3)P, phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate, PtdIns(3,4)P2, and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate were synthesized as described elsewhere (20Kubiak R.J. Bruzik K.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 2415-2418Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These derivatives were selected over naturally occurring PIs containingcis-unsaturated sn-2 acyl groups due to difficulties involved in the chemical synthesis of the latter. Since the concentration of PIs used in this study was limited to 3 mol %, the effect of their sn-2 acyl chains on the membrane structure would not be significant. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis. The Liposofast microextruder and 100-nm polycarbonate filters were from Avestin (Ottawa, Canada). Fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin was from Bayer, Inc. (Kankakee, IL). Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes for molecular biology were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). (3-[3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate and octyl glucoside were from Sigma and Fisher, respectively. The Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Mutations of p40phox-PX were performed by the overlap extension PCR method (21Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6825) Google Scholar). Each construct was subcloned into the pET21a vector containing a C-terminal His6 tag and transformed into DH5α cells for plasmid isolation. After verifying the DNA sequence of each construct, the plasmid was transformed into BL21(DE3) cells for protein expression. One liter of 2× YT medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with BL21(DE3) cells harboring each construct and grown at 37 °C until absorbance at 600 nm reached 1.0. At this time, 1 mm of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and cells were then incubated at 25 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested for 10 min at 4000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mmNaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 0.3 mNaCl, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10 mm imidazole. The solution was then sonicated for 8 min using a 30-s sonication followed by 30-s cooling on ice. This was followed by centrifugation at 48,000 × g to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was filtered into a 50-ml tube, and 1 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was added. The mixture was incubated on ice with gentle stirring (80 rpm) for 1 h. After this time, the mixture was poured onto a column, which was washed with 20 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 0.3m NaCl and 15 mm imidazole. Subsequently, the protein was eluted from the column in six fractions using 0.5 ml of 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, containing 0.3m NaCl and 300 mm imidazole. Purity was checked on an 18% polyacrylamide gel, and samples were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml for gel filtration chromatography. The 1-ml sample was loaded onto a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 0.1 m NaCl. Fractions corresponding to the p40phox-PX peak, as checked electrophoretically, were pooled and concentrated to 1 ml. Protein concentration was then determined using the BCA method (Pierce). The full-length human p40phox (residues 2–339) and W207R mutation were expressed and purified as described (7Bravo J. Karathanassis D. Pacold C.M. Pacold M.E. Ellson C.D. Anderson K.E. Butler P.J. Lavenir I. Perisic O. Hawkins P.T. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 829-839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Mutants of p47phox-PX and full-length p47phox were constructed, expressed, and purified as previously described (12Karathanassis D. Stahelin R.V. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C.M. Cho W. Williams R.L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). EGFP in pEGFP vector (Clontech) was modified by PCR to remove the first methionine and to add two amino-terminal glycines and anEcoRI site. The modified EGFP gene was inserted into a modified pIND vector (Invitrogen) between the EcoRI andXhoI sites to yield a plasmid, pIND/EGFP. p40phox-PX was cloned by PCR to remove the stop codon and add two C-terminal glycines and an EcoRI site. The PCR product was digested with NotI and EcoRI and ligated into pIND/EGFP to generate a C-terminal EGFP-fused p40phox-PX with spacer sequence GGNSGG. EGFP-fused constructs of p40phox-PX mutants, p47phox-PX, and p47phox-PX mutants were generated by the same method. The penetration of p40phox-PX and p47phox-PX into the phospholipid monolayer was measured by monitoring the change in surface pressure (π) at constant surface area using a 10-ml circular Teflon trough and Wilhelmy plate connected to a Cahn microbalance as previously described (22Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). All our monolayer measurements were performed at 23 °C, since at higher temperature water evaporation and protein instability caused significant experimental problems. A lipid monolayer containing various combinations of phospholipids was spread onto the subphase composed of 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl until the desired initial surface pressure (π0) was reached. After the signal stabilized (∼5 min), 30 μg of proteins were injected, and the increase in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored for 45 min while stirring the subphase at 60 rpm. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 20 min. It has been shown empirically that Δπ caused by a protein is mainly due to the penetration of the protein into the lipid monolayer. For example, in the case of the C2 domain of cytosolic phospholipase A2, excellent agreement was found between large Δπ caused by several residues in the calcium binding loops (22Bittova L. Sumandea M. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9665-9672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and their actual membrane penetration measured by fluorescence (23Nalefski E.A. Falke J.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17642-17650Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and electron spin resonance studies (24Ball A. Nielsen R. Gelb M.H. Robinson B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6282-6292Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (e.g.[p40phox-PX] ≥ 2.0 μg/ml); therefore, protein concentration in the subphase was maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximum value. The resulting Δπ was plotted versus π0, from which the critical surface pressure (πc) was determined as the x-intercept (26Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). All SPR measurements were performed at 23 °C. A detailed protocol for coating the L1 sensor chip has been described elsewhere (27Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the sensor chip surface, 90 μl of vesicles containing various phospholipids (see Table I) were injected at 5 μl/min to give a response of 4000 resonance units. Similarly, a control surface was coated with vesicles, typically without the PI of interest, to give the same resonance unit response as the active binding surface. Under our experimental conditions, no binding was detected to this control surface beyond the refractive index change for the PX domains. Each lipid layer was stabilized by injecting 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH three times at 100 μl/min. Typically, no decrease in lipid signal was seen after the first injection. Kinetic SPR measurements were done at the flow rate of 60 μl/min. 90 μl of protein in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.1m KCl was injected to give an association time of 90 s, whereas the dissociation was monitored for 400 s or more. The lipid surface was regenerated using 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH. After sensorgrams were obtained for five different concentrations of each protein within a 10-fold range of Kd, each of the sensorgrams was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it. The association and dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: protein + (protein binding site on vesicle) ↔ (complex) using BIAevalutation 3.0 software (Biacore) as described previously (28Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 29Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30Stahelin R.V.

The dissociation constant (Kd) was then calculated from the equation, Kd =kd/ka. Mass transport (31Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar, 32Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) was not a limiting factor in our experiments, since change in flow rate (from 2 to 60 μl/min) did not affect kinetics of association and dissociation. After curve fitting, residual plots and χ2values were checked to verify the validity of the binding model. Each data set was repeated three times to calculate a S.D. value. Also,Kd values were separately determined from equilibrium SPR measurements. For these measurements, the flow rate was reduced to 2 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the association phase, which in turn allows resonance unit values to reach saturating response values (Req).Req values were then plotted versusprotein concentrations (C), and the Kdvalue was determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation: Req =Rmax/(1 + Kd/C), where Rmax is a maximalReq value.Table IBinding parameters for p40phax-PX and mutants determined from SPR analysisProteinsPIs1-aMol % of PtdIns(3)P (or PtdIns(3,4)P2 for p47phox-PX) in POPC/POPE/PI (77 - x:20:x) vesicles.kakdKd- Fold increase in Kd1-b-Fold increase in Kd relative to the binding of p40phox-PX to POPC/POPE/PtdIns(3)P (77:20:3) vesicles.%m−1s−1s−1mp40phox-PX0NM1-cNM, not measurable.NMNMp40phox-PX0.2(7.5 ± 0.8) × 105(9.0 ± 0.9) × 10−2(1.2 ± 0.2) × 10−792p40phox-PX0.5(9.0 ± 1.2) × 105(3.6 ± 0.4) × 10−2(4.0 ± 0.7) × 10−831p40phox-PX1(1.0 ± 0.3) × 106(9.3 ± 0.8) × 10−3(9.3 ± 3.0) × 10−97p40phox-PX3(1.0 ± 0.2) × 106(1.3 ± 0.3) × 10−3(1.3 ± 0.4) × 10−91p40phox-PX5(1.2 ± 0.3) × 106(8.0 ± 1.0) × 10−4(6.7 ± 1.9) × 10−100.51p40phox-PX3(1.0 ± 0.2) × 106(1.3 ± 0.3) × 10−3(1.3 ± 0.4) × 10−91F35A3(2.1 ± 0.4) × 105(9.0 ± 0.9) × 10−3(4.3 ± 0.9) × 10−833R58Q3(9.0 ± 0.8) × 104(2.1 ± 0.3) × 10−2(2.3 ± 0.4) × 10−7177R60A3(3.2 ± 0.5) × 105(7.3 ± 0.8) × 10−3(2.3 ± 0.4) × 10−818L82A3(1.2 ± 0.3) × 106(1.9 ± 0.7) × 10−3(1.6 ± 0.4) × 10−91.2Y94A3(6.2 ± 0.6) × 105(2.2 ± 0.3) × 10−2(3.5 ± 0.6) × 10−827V95A3(1.0 ± 0.2) × 106(7.7 ± 0.8) × 10−3(7.7 ± 2.0) × 10−96R105A3(2.6 ± 0.3) × 105(1.2 ± 0.3) × 10−2(4.6 ± 1.3) × 10−835p47phox-PX3(1.6 ± 0.3) × 104(6.1 ± 0.7) × 10−4(3.8 ± 0.8) × 10−829p47phox-PX31-dPOPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3,4)P2 (74:20:3:3).(9.6 ± 0.9) × 104(1.4 ± 0.2) × 10−4(1.5 ± 0.3) × 10−91.2FYVE-Vps27p3(3.5 ± 0.5) × 103(1.8 ± 0.3) × 10−4(5.1 ± 1.1) × 10−8391-a Mol % of PtdIns(3)P (or PtdIns(3,4)P2 for p47phox-PX) in POPC/POPE/PI (77 - x:20:x) vesicles.1-b -Fold increase in Kd relative to the binding of p40phox-PX to POPC/POPE/PtdIns(3)P (77:20:3) vesicles.1-c NM, not measurable.1-d POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3,4)P2 (74:20:3:3).

PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdSer were docked onto the p47phox-PX structure using the bound sulfate ions as guides in placing the lipid phosphate groups. Steric clashes were fixed manually. A stable HEK293 cell line expressing the ecdysone receptor (Invitrogen) was used for all experiments. Briefly, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 98% humidity until 90% confluent. Cells were passaged into eight wells of a Lab-TechTM chambered cover glass for later transfection and visualization. Only cells between the 5th and 20th passages were used. For transfection, 80–90% confluent cells in Lab-TechTM chambered cover glass wells were exposed to 150 μl of unsupplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5 μg of endotoxin-free DNA and 1 μl of LipofectAMINETM reagent (Invitrogen) for 7–8 h at 37 °C. After exposure, the transfection medium was removed, the cells were washed once with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and overlaid with fetal bovine serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing ZeocinTM (Invitrogen) and 2 μg/ml ponasterone A (Invitrogen) to induce protein production. Images were obtained using a four-channel Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. EGFP was excited using the 488-nm line of an argon/krypton laser. A linepass 505-nm filter was used on channel 1 for all experiments. A ×63, 1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective was used for all experiments. Immediately before imaging, the induction medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 150 μl of 1 mmHEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm KCl, 0.67 mmd-glucose, 6.4 mm sucrose and then overlaid with the same buffer. For p47phox-PX translocation measurements, PtdIns(3,4)P2 was delivered to HEK293 cells by the lipid-shuttle method using histone or neomycin as a lipid carrier as described (36Ozaki S. DeWald D.B. Shope J.C. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 11286-11291Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, PtdIns(3,4)P2 (20 μm) and histone (or neomycin) (20 μm) were incubated together for 10 min at 25 °C and then sonicated for 2 min in a water bath sonicator. Translocation was initiated by treating cells with the lipid-shuttle complex, and the translocation of p47phox-PX was monitored by scanning cells every 5–10 s. Treatment of cells with histone or PtdIns(3,4)P2 alone did not induce translocation of p47phox-PX after 20 min. In control experiments, cells were treated with 100 nm wortmannin for 30 min to determine the effects of PI 3-kinase on PX domain subcellular localization.

https://openalex.org/W2096630683,"Several intracellular membrane trafficking events are mediated by tyrosine-containing motifs within the cytosolic domains of integral membrane proteins. Many such motifs conform to the consensus YXXΦ, where Φ represents a bulky hydrophobic residue. This motif interacts with the medium chain () subunits of adaptor complexes that link the cytosolic domains of integral membrane proteins to the clathrin coat involved in vesicle formation. The YXXΦ motif is similar to motifs in which the tyrosine residue is phosphorylated by tyrosine kinases. Tyrphostins (structural analogs of tyrosine) are inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and function by binding to the active sites of the enzymes. We previously showed that, in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, some tyrphostins can inhibit the interaction between YXXΦ motifs and the 2 subunit of the AP-2 adaptor complex (Crump, C., Williams, J. L., Stephens, D. J., and Banting, G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 28073–28077). A23 is such a tyrphostin. We now show that molecular modeling of tyrphostin A23 into the tyrosine-binding pocket in 2 provides a structural explanation for A23 being able to inhibit the interaction between YXXΦ motifs and 2. Furthermore, we show that A23 inhibited the internalization of125I-transferrin in Heb7a cells without having any discernible effect on the morphology of compartments of the endocytic pathway. Control tyrphostins, active as inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity, but incapable of inhibiting the YXXΦ motif/2 interaction, did not inhibit endocytosis. These data are consistent with A23 inhibition of the YXXΦ motif/2 interaction in intact cells and with the possibility that different tyrphostins may be used to inhibit specific membrane trafficking events in eukaryotic cells."

AREs vary considerably, however, in both size and sequence context. To assess the heterogeneity involved in control of mRNA stability by ARE motifs, human mRNA sequences from IL-1α-stimulated HEK293 cells and T98G cells were screened for either instability or stability using both cDNA (950 ARE containing sequences) and Affymetrix oligonucleotide (U95Av2 GeneChip) array analysis. Although ARE-containing mRNAs exhibited a broad range of stability, IL-1α promoted stability in a subset of mRNAs that were unstable when transcriptionally induced by tumor necrosis factor α. Stabilization of granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor and IL-8 mRNAs by IL-1α was achieved only after 2 h of stimulation, required ongoing protein synthesis, and depended on the activation of p38 MAPK. In contrast, stabilization of Gro3 mRNA in response to IL-1α was achieved immediately and was insensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis and p38 MAPK activation. In concert, these findings demonstrate that ARE sequences are functionally heterogeneous; only a subset of unstable mRNAs is sensitive to stabilization by IL-1α. Moreover, IL-1α promotes stabilization of unstable mRNAs through distinct mechanistic pathways that distinguish between specific mRNA sequences.

Although much attention has been directed at the role of transcription in the activation of inflammatory gene expression, post-transcriptional events, particularly the stability of specific mRNAs, have also been shown to be important in control of gene expression (4Guhaniyogi J. Brewer G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 265: 11-23Google Scholar, 5Mitchell P. Tollervey D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 193-198Google Scholar). Indeed many mRNAs encoding inflammatory gene products are inherently unstable, although decay may be controlled selectively in response to extracellular stimulus. The importance of these mechanisms is illustrated in studies of the post-transcriptional control of TNFα1 mRNA wherein both mRNA stability and translation have been shown to be critical determinants of the magnitude of the inflammatory response (6Kontoyiannis D. Pasparakis M. Pizarro T.T. Cominelli F. Kollias G. Immunity. 1999; 10: 387-398Google Scholar, 7Carballo E. Lai W.S. Blackshear P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 1001-1005Google Scholar). Adenosine uridine-rich elements (AREs) found in the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of many inflammatory cytokines and growth factors are well known to promote rapid mRNA degradation (8Caput D.

Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that rates of mRNA decay can be modified in response to extracellular stimulation (10Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol.

Cooper J.A. Resch K. Kracht M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6742-6753Google Scholar). For example, IL-1α has been shown to enhance the stability of a variety of cytokine and chemokine mRNAs that otherwise exhibit short half-lives, and this depends, at least in part, upon the presence of ARE motifs in the 3′-UTRs (10Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 11Stoeckle M.Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 917-920Google Scholar, 12Holtmann H.

A recent search of human sequence databases has identified over 900 human mRNAs that contain one or more ARE motifs (13Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Google Scholar), and it seems unlikely that all such mRNAs will exhibit comparable sensitivity to regulatory mechanisms governing their stability. Indeed, studies using mRNAs with defined ARE sequences have demonstrated sequence-specific functional heterogeneity that reflects the differential participation of distinct ARE binding proteins (14Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7268-7278Google Scholar, 15Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6960-6971Google Scholar, 16Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). To further evaluate the functional heterogeneity of AREs, we determined the sensitivity of a set of ARE-containing mRNAs to IL-1α-induced stabilization. We also assessed the mechanistic diversity of IL-1α-mediated mRNA stabilization with respect to the pathways through which stimulus and mRNA decay mechanism are coupled. As a first step, we examined the expression of multiple ARE containing mRNAs using cDNA and oligonucleotide array analysis. The results demonstrate that, although many IL-1α-inducible, ARE-containing mRNAs are unstable, a subset of the mRNAs are stabilized by the stimulus. This effect is specific for IL-1α, because TNFα induces transcription of many of the same genes but does not lead to stabilization of their mRNAs. Finally, within the set of IL-1α-inducible and stabilized mRNAs, there appear to be multiple intracellular pathways through which the stabilization end point can be achieved. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, antibiotics, glutamine, agarose, guanidine isothiocyanate, and cesium chloride were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Rockville, MD). Anhydrous ethanol, Sarkosyl, and formamide were obtained from International Biotechnologies, Inc. (New Haven, CT). Magna nylon transfer membrane was obtained from Micron Separations Inc. (Westboro, MA). Fetal bovine serum was purchased from BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). Actinomycin D (ActD) and cycloheximide (CHX) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Recombinant human IL-1α and TNFα were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA) was the source of [α-32P]dCTP. SB203580 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). HEK293 cells and T98G glioblastoma cells were obtained from Dr. Xiaoxia Li and Dr. George Stark, respectively (Lerner Research Institute). Both cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 107 fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin in humidified 57 CO2. Total cellular RNA was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate-cesium chloride method (17Chirgwin J.M. Pryzbyla R.J. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5295-5299Google Scholar). Northern hybridization analysis was done as previously described (18Tebo J.M. Kim H.S. Gao J. Armstrong D.A. Hamilton T.A. Blood. 1998; 92: 4742-4749Google Scholar). RNA labeling and hybridization were carried out according to the protocol supplied by Affymetrix. In brief, RNA was isolated by the guanidine/CsCl method (17Chirgwin J.M. Pryzbyla R.J. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5295-5299Google Scholar), and 10 ॖg of total RNA per sample was converted to double-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 polymerase site. The resulting cDNA was then used as template forin vitro transcription with biotinylated CTP and UTP to generate cRNA. 15 ॖg of fragmented cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U95Av2 GeneChips. The arrays were washed and stained according to supplied protocols and scanned using an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner. Raw image data was processed and normalized using Microarray Analysis suite 4.0. cDNA array and hybridization were carried out as previously described (19Frevel M.A.E. Bakheet T. Silva A.M. Hisong J.G. Khabar K.S.A. Williams B.R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 425-436Google Scholar). The ARE cDNA array used in this study was composed of ∼950 ARE-containing genes defined in the ARED data base (13Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Google Scholar), 18 genes potentially involved in AU-directed mRNA decay, and 50 housekeeping genes. Briefly, for each array hybridization, RNAs from treated and untreated cells were labeled with Cy3 and Cy5, respectively. The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs were pooled and hybridized to the array slide under a coverglass in a CMT hybridization chamber for 16 h. Subsequently, slides were washed and scanned on a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon). Raw fluorescence data were acquired with the GenePix software and imported into the GeneSpring software version 4.2 for further analysis. To evaluate the functional heterogeneity of ARE-containing mRNAs with respect to instability and stimulus-induced stabilization, the decay characteristics of multiple mRNAs were determined in IL-1α-stimulated cells using both oligonucleotide and cDNA array analyses. HEK293 cells and T98G glioblastoma cells were used to prepare three RNA populations: 1) untreated, 2) stimulated for 2 h with IL-1α, or 3) stimulated for 2 h with IL-1α followed by addition of ActD for an additional 4 h. The three total RNA samples from each cell line were used for preparation of cRNA and subjected to array analysis using either the Affymetrix U95Av2 GeneChips or a custom cDNA array prepared using the sequences defined in the ARED data base of ARE-containing mRNAs (13Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Google Scholar). The analysis restricted consideration of IL-1α-inducible mRNAs to those showing >5-fold induction after 2 h of stimulation. The IL-1α inducibility of individual mRNAs varied between cell lines (only a subset were identified in both 293 and T98G cells). These were segregated as either stable (less than 907 decay over 4 h), moderately stable (10–607 decay over 4 h), or unstable (greater than 607 decay over 4 h). The mRNAs identified using these selection criteria are listed in TableI; each classification contains approximately equal numbers of mRNAs. Interestingly, within all three groups the majority of mRNAs contain an ARE (defined as having at least one AUUUA pentamer) within the 3′-UTR. Although some mRNAs in each group did not possess even one AUUUA pentamer, stretches of poly U- or AU-rich regions may also destabilize mRNA (these have been designated class III AREs) (16Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). Nonetheless, it is apparent that ARE-containing mRNAs exhibit considerable heterogeneity in terms of their rates of decay in the presence of IL-1α ranging from very stable to very unstable. 47 of 60 mRNAs classified as stable or moderately stable contained AREs, and these could be unstable mRNAs that are stabilized in response to IL-1 stimulation. Some of these mRNAs may, however, be inherently stable, and, because decay was not assessed in the absence of IL-1α, we cannot conclude that IL-1α caused a change in their stability.Table IStability of IL-1-inducible mRNAsmRNAAccession numberCell typeIL-11-aIncrease (-fold) relative to untreated sample.IL-1/ActD1-aIncrease (-fold) relative to untreated sample.ARE1-bNC indicates that no complete 3′-UTR sequence could be found in GenBank™.Unstable mRNAs JunBM29039293 (T98G) 66 (15)3 (−27)Yes IEX-1S981914T98G (293) 56 (23)6 (2)Yes PhosphohydrolaseAF017786T98G 506No GADD45BAF078077293 47−3No TNF A20M59465293 (T98G) 36 (15)3 (2)Yes NGFBX52599T98G 18−2.8Yes MAD-3 (IkBα)M69043293 (T98G) 17 (6)−20 (−4)Yes Polydomain proteinAL079279T98G 14−2No TTP-likeM92843293 132Yes Pilot mRNAX63741293 122Yes MusculinAF017786T98G 11−6No Ephrin-A1M57730T98G 11−3No Ser/Thr kinaseD14497T98G 11−3Yes AminopeptidaseM22324T98G 10−2No HSCL100X68277293 (T98G) 10 (16)−11 (−17)Yes IAP1AF099935T98G 102Yes GADD34U83981293 101Yes TIP-3AB000734T98G 10−3No CD69Z22576T98G91Yes GOS3L4916929392Yes SKIP1U058752938−4Yes Transducin-like enhancerM99438T98G8−4Yes IRF1L05072T98G (293)7 (5)−2 (−3)Yes Kinesin heavy chainU06698T98G6−2Yes GlcNAc6STAB014679T98G6−4No RhoBM12174T98G6−1Yes B2-bradykinin receptorX86163T98G61Yes TNFαXM1658232936−1Yes Protein phosphataseU159322936−3No Tissue factorJ0293129361Yes ETR101M628312935−2No STAT-inhibitor 3AB004904T98G5−8NC ARCAAM35296T98G5−1NC c-JunJ04111T98G5−14Yes DEPPAB0227182935−3Yes His-rich glycoproteinM1314929351NoModerately stable mRNAs GMCSFNM000758T98G269149Yes GRO2XM003510293 85 24Yes BMP-2AM22489T98G 278Yes DiubiquitinBC012472T98G 16 12No TRAF1U19261T98G 145No PilotX63741293 145Yes MAFFNM012323T98G (293) 13 (11)9 (7)Yes ATF3L19871293 (T98G) 10 (5)3 (1)Yes Receptor for 4–1BBU03398T98G93Yes WAF-1U03106T98G85Yes BLIMP1AF084199T98G86Yes TNF-inducible IAPAF099935T98G83Yes KallikreinM25629T98G74No PDH7AB006757T98G74No C-CSFX03656T98G72Yes CX3C chem. precursorU84487T98G73Yes FAST1AF076292T98G64NC AQP-1U41518T98G64Yes MucinU3283T98G62Yes Protein-Tyr phosphataseU1593229362Yes RelX7504229352Yes HGC6.1.2AB016900T98G52No HB15Z11697T98G53Yes HOX2X16665T98G53Yes NOR1D78579T98G52Yes 21-Hydroxylase BM26856T98G52No HCG1X81006T98G52Yes DSCR1U85267T98G54Yes AQP-3BC01356629353NoStable mRNAs IL-8M28130T98G (293)604 (31)629 (28)Yes GRO3M36821T98G (293)198 (26)191 (24)Yes Endothelin-1J05008T98G197222Yes GRO1X54489293 88101Yes ExodusU64197T98G (293) 86 (10)154 (14)Yes ICAM-1M24283T98G 58 50Yes IL-6X04430T98G 55 53Yes VCAM-1M73255T98G 42 34Yes COX-2U04636T98G 38 41Yes SCYB10X02530T98G3033Yes NK4 homologousAA631972T98G2731No PTX3M31166T98G2626Yes My1X63131T98G1518No MN SODX07834T98G1419Yes GTP cyclohydrolaseU19523T98G1213Yes B94M92357T98G1213No MCP-2Y16645T98G1212Yes CalpainX85030T98G1110Yes TSG-6M31165T98G1113Yes IL-1BM15330T98G1010Yes MCP-1M28225T98G10 9Yes Fibulin-2X82494T98G 912No HOX11S38742T98G 8 7Yes HSP27 (ISG12)X67325T98G 7 9No ELAM-1M24736293 7 8Yes PAI-1NM000602T98G 6 7Yes GPP130U55853T98G 6 7Yes Act-2J04130T98G 6 5Yes Tenacin-receptorAL049689293 6 7Yes Gln cyclotransferaseU19523T98G 5 4Yes Chromagranin AU06698T98G 5 4No1-a Increase (-fold) relative to untreated sample.1-b NC indicates that no complete 3′-UTR sequence could be found in GenBank™. Open table in a new tab To confirm the behavior of specific mRNAs seen in array analysis, cultures of HEK293 and T98G cells were stimulated with IL-1α for 2 h, and some cultures were further treated with ActD for an additional 4 h. Total RNA was prepared, and the levels of selected mRNAs were determined by Northern hybridization analysis. In each cell line, we examined two unstable mRNAs and two stable (or moderately stable) mRNAs. The results confirmed the data presented in Table I; the selected mRNAs were strongly induced by IL-1α, and they either decayed rapidly (TNF A20, c-Jun, mannose binding protein) or were stable in the presence of IL-1α (GM-CSF, Gro3, Gro1, IL-8) (Fig.1, lanes 1–3). To identify unstable mRNAs in which stability was enhanced by IL-1α treatment, we took advantage of a prior observation that, although TNFα and IL-1α can both induce transcription of the mouse KC (CXCL1) chemokine mRNA, only IL-1α treatment promotes its stabilization (20Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 2: 590-596Google Scholar, 21Tebo J. Datta S. Kishore R. Kolosov M. Major J.A. Ohmori Y. Hamilton T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12987-12993Google Scholar). Each of the mRNAs induced by IL-1α could also be induced in response to TNFα treatment but in this instance, they all exhibited rapid decay (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). It is noteworthy that those mRNAs that are stabilized by IL-1α exhibit markedly greater accumulation in response to IL-1α as compared with TNFα, whereas those that are unstable in both conditions show comparable expression in response to either stimulus. In cultures treated initially with TNFα to induce detectable levels of each mRNA, the addition of IL-1α along with ActD also resulted in the stabilization of Gro3 and GM-CSF in T98G cells and IL-8 and Gro3 in 293 cells, whereas the other mRNAs, although expressed, were not stabilized (Fig. 1, lane 6). These findings clearly establish that these specific mRNAs are inherently unstable but can be stabilized in response to treatment with IL-1α. The preceding findings establish that ARE-containing mRNAs are functionally heterogeneous with respect to their sensitivity to IL-1α-mediated stabilization. To assess whether there exists further heterogeneity within the set of mRNAs that are subject to such stabilization, we compared the stabilization of IL-8, GM-CSF, and Gro3 mRNAs in IL-1α-stimulated T98G cells with respect to their individual dependence on time, protein synthesis, and p38 MAPK activation. As a first approach, we determined whether enhanced stability of each mRNA is acquired immediately or, rather, only after some stimulation period. T98G cells were stimulated for 1, 2, or 4 h with IL-1α followed by the addition of ActD for a further 2-h period to assess decay (Fig. 2). At 1 h after stimulation both IL-8 and GM-CSF mRNAs decayed rapidly. After 2 h of stimulation, however, both these mRNAs exhibited enhanced stability. In contrast, Gro3 mRNA, although only modestly induced at 1 h, was already stable and exhibited very limited decay at any of the time points. The time requirement for stabilization of GM-CSF and IL-8 suggested the possibility that synthesis of a new protein might be required as part of the stabilization process induced by IL-1α. To test this, T98G cells were stimulated with IL-1α in the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for 2 h and washed thoroughly to remove the reversible inhibitor prior to the addition of fresh medium containing ActD. Cultures were harvested at various times afterward, and levels of specific mRNA were determined (Fig.3). The stabilization of both GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs was reduced appreciably when the stimulation was carried out in the presence of CHX. In contrast the stability of Gro3 was largely unaltered in CHX pre-treated cells. IL-1α can stabilize TNFα-induced mRNAs immediately in the absence of transcription, whereas stabilization of IL-1α-induced GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs requires protein synthesis. To resolve this apparent conflict we reasoned that TNFα might provide a partial signal, corresponding to the protein synthesis requirement, which is completed upon the later addition of IL-1α. To evaluate this possibility, the effect of CHX on the ability of IL-1α to stabilize TNFα-induced mRNA was determined. T98G cells were first stimulated with TNFα for 2 h in the presence or absence of CHX. After thorough washing to remove the inhibitor, the cells were treated with IL-1α and ActD, and mRNA levels were determined following further incubation. TNFα-induced Gro3 and GM-CSF mRNAs were both unstable in the absence of IL-1α and were stabilized when IL-1α was added during the decay incubation (Fig.4). Inclusion of CHX during the 2-h stimulation with TNFα enhanced the accumulation of both mRNAs equivalently but did not alter decay rates as compared with cells stimulated without CHX. In cells treated with CHX and TNF, however, IL-1α did not stabilize GM-CSF mRNA but the ability to stabilize Gro3 mRNA was not affected. These results demonstrate that the stabilization of select mRNAs in response to IL-1α requires protein synthesis and suggest that there are at least two pathways that control ARE-dependent mRNA decay. IL-1α-induced stabilization of some mRNAs is believed to depend upon activation of the p38 MAPK (10Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 22Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 3065-3068Google Scholar). This has been demonstrated in multiple settings through the use of the specific p38 protein kinase inhibitor SB203580 and by overexpression of constitutively active forms of both MKK6 and MK2 (upstream and downstream kinases in the p38 kinase cascade, respectively). To determine if IL-1α-mediated mRNA stabilization is p38-dependent, we examined the decay of selected mRNAs in IL-1α-treated cells with or without the addition of the kinase inhibitor SB203580. Cultures of T98G cells were stimulated with IL-1α for 2 h prior to the addition of ActD with or without SB203580. Although the stability of GM-CSF was reduced by inhibition of p38 kinase activity, Gro3 mRNA remained relatively stable (Fig.5A). Gro3 and GM-CSF mRNAs were both unstable when induced by TNFα treatment, and both were stabilized if IL-1α was added at the same time as ActD (Fig.5B). The ability of IL-1α to stabilize TNFα-induced GM-CSF was blocked by SB203580, whereas the stimulus-induced stabilization of Gro3 mRNA was not altered. This further supports the possibility that GM-CSF and Gro3 mRNA sequences are controlled by distinct IL-1α-sensitive mRNA decay mechanisms. This differential behavior apparently reflects cell type- and stimulus-specific mechanisms, because recent findings using similar methodologies demonstrate that Gro3 mRNA stability induced in monocytic THP-1 cells by lipopolysaccharide is sensitive to the effects of the p38 inhibitor (19Frevel M.A.E. Bakheet T. Silva A.M. Hisong J.G. Khabar K.S.A. Williams B.R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 425-436Google Scholar). The experimental protocol used in the preceding experiments involved the addition of the p38 inhibitor 2 h after the IL-1α stimulus when GM-CSF mRNA had been stabilized. In many cases, the activation of p38 MAPK in response to IL-1α or TNFα stimulation is rapid and transient and has returned to near basal levels within a 2-h time period (24Lasa M. Abraham S.M. Boucheron C. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7802-7811Google Scholar, 25Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77Google Scholar). In concert with the findings in Fig. 2 demonstrating a selective delay in the acquisition of stability for IL-8 and GM-CSF mRNAs, this suggests that p38 kinase activity impacts on stabilization of these mRNAs only after the 2-h time. Indeed, pre-treatment of T98G cells with SB203580 for 30 min before the addition of IL-1α did not alter the amount of GM-CSF, IL-8, or Gro3 mRNA measured at 2 h (Fig. 6,lanes 3 and 4). As expected, when SB203580 was added to cells along with ActD 2 h after IL-1α, there was a significant reduction in the amounts of GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNA following a further 2-h incubation period (Fig. 6, lanes 5and 6). Gro3 mRNA was insensitive to the p38 inhibitor as previously seen (Fig. 2). These findings suggest that it is not the initial burst of p38 activity following IL-1α stimulation but, rather, some modest residual kinase activity in the post 2-h activation that is required for stabilization of sensitive mRNAs. A similar observation regarding the time during which p38 kinase modulates mRNA stability has recently been reported (24Lasa M. Abraham S.M. Boucheron C. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7802-7811Google Scholar) The importance of AREs in determining the rate of decay of select mRNAs is well established, and the ability of extracellular stimuli to modulate ARE-dependent mRNA turnover is now recognized (8Caput D.

Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). The large number of mRNAs containing such sequences within their 3′-UTRs suggests that there is likely to be substantial heterogeneity in their function (13Bakheet T. Frevel M. Williams B.R. Greer W. Khabar K.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 246-254Google Scholar). The current study was therefore undertaken to assess the scope of this diversity with particular emphasis on sensitivity to IL-1α-mediated stabilization. This has been accomplished by examining the behavior of ARE-containing mRNAs in IL-1α-stimulated cells using a combination of cDNA and oligonucleotide arrays and by assessing the intracellular events associated with the stabilization of a select set of mRNAs. The results demonstrate first that there is a broad range of decay rates for ARE-containing mRNAs induced in response to IL-1α. Second, only a subset of unstable ARE-containing mRNAs acquires enhanced stability via the action of IL-1α. Finally, IL-1α treatment appears to utilize at least two separate pathways to achieve stabilization of individual mRNAs. The one or more mechanisms governing acquired stabilization of GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs are dependent on time, continuing protein synthesis, and the activation of p38 MAPK. In contrast, the stabilization of Gro3 mRNA occurs immediately and is insensitive to inhibitors of protein synthesis and p38 kinase activity. Because these mechanisms operate differentially on the two different mRNA populations, they are apparently dependent upon functionally distinct regulatory sequences within the mRNAs themselves. Because the range in decay rates for different ARE-containing mRNAs is quite large, the identification of mRNAs whose stability is subject to modulation in response to IL-1α requires the ability to examine the rate of message decay in the absence of IL-1α. Many of the IL-1α-induced mRNAs are also induced transcriptionally in response to TNFα but are not stable in this circumstance. The ability of IL-1α to stabilize such mRNAs in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor ActD demonstrates directly the independent stabilization response. Some TNFα-induced mRNAs, however, remain unstable in the presence of IL-1α, and this establishes the scope of heterogeneity for ARE-containing sequences with respect to stimulus sensitivity. Within the subset of IL-1α-induced, ARE-containing mRNAs that are also stabilized in response to IL-1α, at least two classes of mRNA can be distinguished, based upon their different temporal requirements for acquisition of enhanced stability. Although Gro3 mRNA appears to be stabilized immediately, both GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs do not exhibit enhanced stability in IL-1α-treated T98G cells until nearly 2 h after the initial exposure to IL-1α. This time dependence appears to reflect a requirement for ongoing protein synthesis, because inhibition of protein synthesis with CHX during this 2-h time period prevents their stabilization. Although IL-1α can stimulate mRNA stabilization immediately in the presence of ActD, this only occurs in cells that have been pre-stimulated with TNFα and the ability of TNFα to promote this 舠priming activity舡 also exhibits sensitivity to CHX. These findings suggest that IL-1α or TNFα can induce thede novo expression of one or more new gene products that are requisite to the mRNA stabilization mechanism. Alternatively, they may reflect a requirement for the continuous production of one or more short-lived proteins from constitutively expressed mRNAs. The differential ability of TNFα and IL-1α to modulate stability of the same mRNAs is somewhat surprising in light of the broadly overlapping signaling and biological response profiles exhibited by these two pro-inflammatory stimuli (25Saklatvala J. Dean J. Finch A. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 63-77Google Scholar). Both agents have in common the activation of multiple protein kinase cascades, including ERK1/2, JNK, and p38. Because p38 MAPK activity has been shown to be necessary for IL-1α-induced mRNA stabilization (10Lasa M. Mahtani K.R. Finch A. Brewer G. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4265-4274Google Scholar, 22Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Google Scholar, 23Neininger A. Kontoyiannis D. Kotlyarov A. Winzen R. Eckert R. Volk H.D. Holtmann H. Kollias G. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3065-3068Google Scholar), the inability of TNFα to promote mRNA stability suggests that IL-1α- and TNFα-mediated p38 activation events are not equivalent or that p38 activation is necessary but not sufficient for stabilization. The requirement for p38 MAPK activation in the IL-1α-induced stabilization of GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs, as reported by others (22Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Google Scholar,26Stoecklin G. Stoeckle P. Lu M. Muehlemann O. Moroni C. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 1578-1588Google Scholar), is confirmed in T98G cells in the present study through the use of the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Interestingly, IL-1α-mediated stabilization of Gro3 mRNA was relatively insensitive to the p38 inhibitor providing further evidence that there is more than one pathway through which mRNA stability can be affected by this stimulus. Because sensitivity to the p38 inhibitor varies with different mRNAs, the underlying mechanisms apparently depend upon the ability of the decay mechanism(s) to discriminate between the mRNA sequences. The activation of p38 MAPK that is necessary for stabilization of GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs apparently occurs only several hours after the addition of IL-1α. This is indicated by the finding that p38 inhibitors do not alter the accumulation of specific mRNAs during the first 2 h of stimulation but do antagonize the stabilization response after the 2-h time point. Thus the early burst of p38 activation that is well characterized as part of the response to many pro-inflammatory stimuli may not link to downstream effector mechanisms involved in mRNA decay. This is consistent with a recent report suggesting that a quantitatively modest but prolonged activation of p38 in IL-1-stimulated cells is requisite to stabilization of COX-2 mRNA (24Lasa M. Abraham S.M. Boucheron C. Saklatvala J. Clark A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7802-7811Google Scholar). Moreover, this raises the possibility that the difference between TNFα and IL-1α treatments with respect to the stabilization of mRNA resides in differential ability to promote a later activation profile. Collectively, our findings lead to a hypothesis that there are at least two sequential steps in the IL-1α-activated process leading to stabilization of both GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs. The first step appears to be the production, either de novo or from existing mRNAs, of one or more proteins required for subsequent events in the stabilization response to IL-1α. The second step might be a delayed and prolonged activation of p38 MAPK. Indeed, the p38 kinase inhibitor can block IL-1α-induced stabilization of IL-8 mRNA at times ranging from 2 up through 8 h after initial stimulation of the cells (data not shown). It is appealing to speculate that these two steps are functionally related; the early, protein synthetic event might prepare the cell for the secondary activation of p38 kinase. This could involve an effect on the activation of the kinase itself or the production of a target for the p38 kinase cascade that participates in controlling the downstream RNA degradation process. Nevertheless, this process is distinct from the IL-1α-dependent stabilization of Gro3 mRNA that is independent of both protein synthesis and p38 MAPK activation. The functional differences in behavior of individual ARE-containing mRNAs are likely to be encoded within the ARE sequences themselves, but the specific features that determine instability as compared with stimulus sensitivity are not understood. ARE motifs have been previously classified into at least three categories based in part upon the distribution of AUUUA pentamers (16Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar). Class I AREs contain multiple isolated AUUUA motifs, class II AREs contain at least two overlapping UUAUUUA(A/U)(A/U) nonamers, and class III AREs contain no AUUUA motifs but generally contain U-rich or AU-rich regions. Recent reports suggest that the stability of certain mRNAs containing class I or class II AREs are controlled by the action of separate ARE binding proteins that differentially recognize and bind these sequences in vivo in a cell type-specific fashion (14Chen C.Y. Xu N. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7268-7278Google Scholar, 15Xu N. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6960-6971Google Scholar). GM-CSF and IL-8 mRNAs both contain class II AREs, whereas the Gro3 ARE can be classified as type I. Thus these mRNAs could be targeted by distinct ARE binding proteins that are differentially regulated by the two pathways discussed previously. A comparison of stimulus sensitivity with ARE classification for a selection of the unstable ARE-containing mRNAs identified in this study, however, reveals no definitive relationship between ARE class and overall sensitivity to IL-1α-induced stabilization (Table II). Whether stimulus sensitivity is encoded within the ARE per se is not established for certain. Studies using defined ARE motifs have shown that short sequence segments from certain mRNAs (40–65 nucleotides, GM-CSF, vascular epidermal growth factor) are sufficient to provide both instability and stimulus sensitivity suggesting that such sequence elements do encode both properties (22Winzen R. Kracht M. Ritter B. Wilhelm A. Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Muller M. Gaestel M. Resch K. Holtmann H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4969-4980Google Scholar, 27Goldberg-Cohen I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13635-13640Google Scholar). Indeed, in at least one case, the sensitivity to stimulus was encoded in only a portion of the full ARE allowing these two properties to be separated (27Goldberg-Cohen I. Furneaux H. Levy A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13635-13640Google Scholar).Table IIARE class and sensitivity to stabilization by IL-1α are not relatedAUUUAsClass 12-aARE classification is based upon examination of known 3′-UTR sequences using the criteria defined by Chen and Shyu (16).Class 2Class 3Stable2-bAll mRNAs are stabilized by IL-1α as shown either in the present study or in prior reports.mRNAs IL-87X Gro15X Gro29X Gro37X IL-63X GM-CSF8X G-CSF4X COX221X IL-1ॆ6X ELAM8XUnstable mRNAs C-JUN3X GADD452X TNFα8X IEX-15X TNFA204X C-FOS3X IFNॆ0X IkBα3X MAN BP4X2-a ARE classification is based upon examination of known 3′-UTR sequences using the criteria defined by Chen and Shyu (16Chen C.-Y.A.

Open table in a new tab It is apparent, then, that substantial diversity exists within ARE-containing mRNAs with regard to regulation of their stability by extracellular stimulation. This functional heterogeneity is clearly based upon sequence differences between individual mRNAs and operates in a fashion that can vary with respect to cell type, stimulus, and intracellular signaling pathways. Because the function of stimulus-induced alterations in mRNA stability can produce very dramatic changes in the accumulation of target mRNAs and hence their encoded protein products, this diversity of mechanism will be important to dissect in detail and may ultimately lead to important opportunities for precisely tailored interventional manipulation of inflammatory gene expression in human disease."

We investigated how inhibition of glucose metabolism could affect death receptor-mediated apoptosis in human tumor cells of diverse origin. We show that both substitution of glucose for pyruvate and treatment with 2-deoxyglucose enhanced apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, CD95 agonistic antibody, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Inhibition of glucose metabolism enhanced killing of myeloid leukemia U937, cervical carcinoma HeLa, and breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells upon death receptor ligation. Caspase activation, mitochondrial depolarization, and cytochrome crelease were increased under these conditions. Glucose deprivation-mediated sensitization to apoptosis was prevented in MCF-7 cells overexpressing BCL-2. Interestingly, the human B-lymphoblastoid cell line SKW6.4, a prototype for mitochondria-independent death receptor-induced apoptosis, was also sensitized to anti-CD95 and TRAIL-induced apoptosis under glucose-free conditions.

Glucose deprivation enhanced death receptor-triggered formation of death-inducing signaling complex and early processing of procaspase-8.

In this respect, understanding the mechanisms that regulate tumor cell sensitivity to death ligand-induced apoptosis should be an important objective in the development of therapies to treat human malignancies. Recent studies (13Thakkar N.S. Potten C.S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 2057-2060PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) have revealed that apoptosis induced by various death receptor-independent treatments is blocked in ATP-depleted cells. Furthermore, although the ATP-dependent steps in apoptosis have not been completely elucidated, it has been suggested that the nuclear transport of pro-apoptotic factors could be one of the processes requiring an active energy metabolism (15Yasuhara N. Eguchi Y. Tachibana T. Imamoto N. Yoneda Y. Tsujimoto Y. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). More controversial is the role of ATP in death receptor-mediated apoptosis as completely opposite results have been reported regarding the effect of ATP depletion on CD95-mediated apoptosis (14Ferrari D.

Thus, some groups have reported (16Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1835-1840PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp.

Most of these studies were performed in glucose-free medium, in the presence of the mitochondrial inhibitor oligomycin, to prevent ATP production from both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and thus achieve maximal depletion of cellular ATP (14Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 16Eguchi Y. Shimizu S. Tsujimoto Y.

However, besides causing ATP depletion, inhibition of F0F1-ATPase by oligomycin may interfere in the apoptotic program by preventing cytosol acidification and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (18Matsuyama S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 318-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Furthermore, oligomycin can cause cell death by apoptosis or necrosis (14Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 20Wolvetang E.J. Johnson K.L. Krauer K. Ralph S.J. Linnane A.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). An elevated number of tumor cells display a high rate of glycolysis under aerobic conditions, and some of them depend on the glycolytic flux to maintain the cellular levels of ATP and metabolism (21Racker E. Am. Sci. 1972; 60: 56-63PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mathupala S.P. Rempel A. Pedersen P.L. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar).In vivo (23Volland S. Amtmann E. Sauer G. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) as well as in vitro (23Volland S. Amtmann E. Sauer G. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 24Halicka H.D. Ardelt B. Li X. Melamed M.M. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 444-449PubMed Google Scholar) studies have revealed that sensitivity of tumor cells to TNF-α is increased under conditions of reduced glucose metabolism. These findings have led some investigators to propose the use of glucose anti-metabolites in combination with TNF-α as a possible anti-tumor treatment (24Halicka H.D. Ardelt B. Li X. Melamed M.M. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 444-449PubMed Google Scholar). However the mechanism underlying the facilitation of TNF-α action by 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG) has not been characterized. More recently, it was reported that glucose deprivation enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis by down-regulating the expression of cFLIP through the ceramide-AKT-FLIP pathway (25Nam S. Amoscato A. Lee Y. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 337-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have examined the effect of glucose deprivation on apoptosis induced upon activation of different death receptors of the TNF/nerve growth factor receptor family in human tumor cells whose ATP levels are largely dependent on the activity of the glycolytic pathway. The results obtained indicated that under conditions of glucose metabolism inhibition, death receptor-induced apoptosis was considerably enhanced in U937 myeloid leukemic, SKW6.4 B-lymphoblastoid, MCF-7 breast carcinoma and HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. Inhibition of glucose metabolism promoted the activation of both mitochondria-dependent and -independent pathways of death receptor-induced apoptosis. Finally, our data indicate that the sensitization mechanism probably involves the increased processing of apical procaspase-8 at the DISC upon death receptor activation.

The human breast tumor cell line MCF-7 was kindly donated by Dr. M. Ruiz de Almodovar (Department of Radiology, University of Granada). Human U937 myeloid leukemic, SKW6.4 B-lymphoblastoid, HeLa cervical carcinoma, and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells were maintained in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm glutamine, and gentamycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2, 95% air incubator. MCF-7 cells stably overexpressing human BCL-2 (MCF-7BCL-2) and mock-transfected cells (MCF-7neo) were generated as described (26Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation under glucose-free conditions was performed by washing cells twice in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium and incubating them in the same medium with 1 mm glutamine, 2 mm pyruvate, and 5% dialyzed FBS. Control cultures were incubated with 2 g/liter glucose instead of pyruvate. Treatment with 2-DG was performed in normal RPMI 1640 medium with 1 mm glutamine and 10% FBS. Hypodiploid apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry according to published procedures (27Gong J. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 218: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Basically, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in cold 70% ethanol, and then stained with propidium iodide while treating with RNase. Quantitative analysis of sub-G1 cells was carried out in a FACScan cytometer using the Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Phosphatidylserine exposure on the surface of apoptotic cells was examined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin-V-FLUOS (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), following instructions provided by the manufacturer. Viable MCF-7 and HeLa cells were determined by the crystal violet method as described (26Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin condensation was assessed after staining of cellular DNA with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (alone or in combination with 1 μm propidium iodide) and viewing the cell preparations under a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescent microscope. ATP was determined luminometrically as described (14Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For measurements of mitochondrial depolarization, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS with 40 nm 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide(3) and 5 μm propidium iodide and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Generation of ROS was quantified by adding H2DCFDA to the culture medium at a concentration of 5 μm, for the last 30 min of treatment. Similar results were obtained when staining with H2DCFDA was performed at room temperature in PBS. Quantitative analyses of ΔΨm(mitochondrial membrane potential) and ROS production were carried out in a FACScan cytometer using the Cell Quest software. MCF-7 and HeLa cells were detached with RPMI/EDTA, washed with PBS, and collected by centrifugation. U937 and SKW6.4 cells were washed with PBS. Protein content was measured before lysing the cells in Laemmli sample buffer under reducing conditions. Cell lysates were sonicated, and proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide minigels and detected as described (26Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar). For measurements of cytochrome c release from mitochondria and BAX redistribution, cells were lysed and cytosolic fractions were separated from mitochondria and nuclei as described previously (28Chandra J. Niemer I. Gilbreath J. Kliche K.O. Andreeff M. Freireich E.J. Keating M. McConkey D.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4220-4229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal protein loading in each lane was verified by incubating membranes with anti-α-tubulin antibody. DISC precipitation was performed using biotin-tagged recombinant TRAIL (Bio-TRAIL) (29MacFarlane M. Harper N. Snowden R. Dyer M. Barnett G. Pringle J. Cohen G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6809-6810Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 30Harper N. Farrow N. Kapstein A. Cohen G. MacFarlane M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34743-34752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which was a gift from Nick Harper (MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, UK). U937 cells (75 × 106 cells/treatment) were washed twice in sterile PBS and incubated for 12 h in glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium with 1 mm glutamine, 2 mm pyruvate, and 5% dialyzed FBS. Control U937 cells were incubated in the same medium with 2 g/liter glucose instead of pyruvate. After this incubation, the same number of control and glucose-deprived cells were treated with Bio-TRAIL for the times indicated in the figure legends. DISC formation was then stopped, and unbound TRAIL was removed by washing the cells three times in ice-cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 3 ml of lysis buffer (30 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, containing CompleteTM protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)) for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. To provide an unstimulated receptor control, Bio-TRAIL was added to lysates from untreated cells. The TRAIL DISC was then precipitated using 30 μl of streptavidin-agarose beads at 4 °C overnight. Precipitates were washed six times with lysis buffer, and receptor complexes were eluted with 30 μl of sample buffer. Western blotting was performed as described above. To address the question of the effect of ATP depletion on death receptor-mediated apoptosis, we first tested whether glucose removal was sufficient to deplete intracellular ATP in U937 cells. Incubation of U937 cells in a glucose-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with pyruvate, glutamine, and 5% dialyzed FBS, as described under “Experimental Procedures,” led to a marked drop in ATP levels (Fig.1). The ATP decrease occurred more rapidly when cells were incubated under the same conditions with 1% dialyzed serum (Fig. 1a). Because viability of cultures upon glucose deprivation was better maintained in medium containing 5% dialyzed FBS, this serum concentration was used in all experiments shown in the present work. When U937 cells were incubated in the absence of glucose and pyruvate, cells died rapidly, probably due to the lack of a carbon source rather than lack of ATP (not shown). We next examined the effect of glucose deprivation on apoptosis induced either by the DNA-damaging drug etoposide or by activators of different death receptors. We observed that in cultures of U937 cells treated with the DNA-damaging drug etoposide under glucose-deprived conditions apoptosis was inhibited (Fig. 1b), in agreement with reported data (14Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Los M. Wesselborg S. Schulze-Osthoff K. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 979-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In contrast, when apoptosis was induced by ligation of CD95, TNFR, or TRAILR, we observed a marked increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in glucose-free medium, as measured by sub-G1 DNA content (Fig. 1b). Inhibition of etoposide-induced apoptosis and enhancement of death receptor-induced apoptosis were also observed in cells incubated under glucose-free conditions with 1% FBS (not shown), in which the ATP content was very low (10% of normal level). It was previously reported that 2-DG, a non-metabolizable glucose analogue that inhibits glucose metabolism, enhanced TNF-α-induced apoptosis in U937 cells (24Halicka H.D. Ardelt B. Li X. Melamed M.M. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 444-449PubMed Google Scholar). We have confirmed these data and demonstrated that anti-CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis was also clearly enhanced when U937 cells were incubated in the presence of 2-DG (Fig. 1c). At the concentration used (5 mm), 2-DG alone did not have a considerable effect on cell death. ATP loss upon 2-DG treatment occurred with similar kinetics to that observed in glucose removal experiments, although the decrease in ATP levels after 20 h of 2-DG treatment was 50% (not shown). To establish further that the death process promoted by glucose metabolism inhibition was apoptosis, U937 cells were treated for 20 h with 2-DG in the presence of death receptor activators, and several features of apoptosis were examined. Results shown in Fig.1c indicate that this death was dependent on caspase activation, as it was completely inhibited by the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Furthermore, results not shown indicated that there was an increase in the number of cells showing nuclear condensation and fragmentation in cultures incubated in the presence of both 2-DG and death receptor activator. In these experiments, 2-DG alone did not have a significant effect on cell death (not shown). Under these conditions, a low percentage of cells (<10% in all cases) was stained with propidium iodide, indicating loss of membrane integrity. However, these cells also displayed marked nuclear apoptotic changes suggesting that the observed changes in membrane permeability were probably due to secondary necrosis. Finally, we determined death receptor-induced translocation of phosphatidylserine to the external side of the plasma membrane when glucose uptake and utilization were inhibited by 2-DG. Results not shown indicated that annexin-V binding to cells upon death receptor triggering was also enhanced in the presence of 2-DG. We next tested whether the regulation by glucose metabolism of death receptor-induced apoptosis was cell type-specific. Accordingly, we carried out some experiments on tumor cells of non-hematopoietic origin such as human breast tumor MCF-7 cells and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells. MCF-7 cells are very resistant to CD95-mediated apoptosis mainly because they express very low levels of CD95 at the cell surface (26Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to analyze the role of glucose metabolism in death receptor-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells, we used TRAIL as an apoptosis trigger. Data shown in Fig. 2a demonstrate that both glucose withdrawal and 2-DG facilitated the activation by TRAIL of caspase-dependent loss of viability in cultures of breast tumor MCF-7 cells. Likewise, glucose removal from the medium strongly enhanced CD95-mediated cell death in cervical carcinoma HeLa cells (Fig. 2b). Death receptor-induced apoptosis can occur by at least two different pathways (31Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). One of them involving the mitochondria is facilitated when protein synthesis is inhibited and is inhibited in cells overexpressing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family members (32Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Zha J. Korsmeyer S.J. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22532-22538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In this respect, death receptor-induced apoptosis in U937 cells is markedly enhanced in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (33Noguchi K. Naito M. Kataoka S. Yonehara S. Tsuruo T. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1271-1277PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibited in clones overexpressing BCL-2 (34Monney L. Otter I. Olivier R. Ravn U. Mirzasaleh H. Fellay I. Poirier G.G. Borer C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 340-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis is required for death receptor-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. In order to understand the step in death receptor-triggered cell death that is modulated by glucose levels, we first examined whether or not inhibition of glucose metabolism may regulate the mitochondria-regulated apoptotic pathway. To this end we analyzed in U937 cells the depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, two mitochondrial parameters that have been largely implicated in death receptor-mediated apoptosis (35Brahma C.A. Ian T. Streets K. Trautwein C. Brenner D.A. Lemasters J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6353-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Fig. 3a shows that although death receptor activation induced mitochondrial depolarization in U937 cells in the absence of 2-DG, this event was further stimulated upon ligation of death receptors in cells incubated in the presence of 2-DG. Likewise, release of cytochrome cinto the cytosol of U937 cells was facilitated in the presence of glucose anti-metabolite (Fig. 3b). In breast tumor MCF-7 cells the mitochondrial pathway is also important in death receptor-triggered apoptosis because these cells are deficient in caspase-3 expression, which is required to activate the non-mitochondrial pathway after death receptor activation (31Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in MCF-7 cells overexpressing BCL-2 or BCL-xL, both CD95 (26Ruiz-Ruiz C. Munoz-Pinedo C. Lopez-Rivas A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5673-5680PubMed Google Scholar) and TRAILR-induced apoptosis (36Srinivasula S.M. Datta P. Fan X.J. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Huang Z. Alnemri E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36152-36157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) are considerably inhibited, indicating a role of mitochondria in death receptor-mediated apoptosis. In MCF-7BCL-2 cells, we examined the effect of glucose deprivation in TRAIL-induced apoptosis. As shown in Fig.3c, TRAIL induced significant death when added to glucose-free mock-transfected cultures (MCF-7neo). Results presented in Fig. 3c demonstrate that overexpression of BCL-2 completely abrogated apoptosis induced by the death ligand in cells deprived of glucose. These results also suggest that in those cell lines in which mitochondria are involved in death receptor-induced apoptosis, glucose deprivation does not overcome BCL-2 protection. The human SKW6.4 B-lymphoblastoid cell line has been extensively used in studies of apoptosis activation by death receptors, particularly CD95. These cells do not require mitochondria-regulated events to undergo apoptosis upon death receptor activation (31Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). In order to get further insight into the mechanism of glucose depletion-promoted enhancement of death receptor-induced apoptosis, we examined the sensitivity of SKW6.4 cells to CD95 antibody and recombinant TRAIL. As shown in Fig. 3d, incubation of these cells in glucose-free medium increased their sensitivity to both CD95 antibody and TRAIL. Altogether, these results suggested that glucose deprivation must regula"
https://openalex.org/W2141495592,"We demonstrate that Dvl-1, casein kinase Iε (CKIε), and Frat-1 activate the Wnt signaling pathway cooperatively. The amino acid region 228–250 of Dvl-1 was necessary for its binding to Frat-1, and the interaction of Dvl-1 with Frat-1 was enhanced by CKIε. Coexpression of Dvl-1 and Frat-1 caused accumulation of β-catenin synergistically in L cells. Both proteins also activated the transcriptional activity of T-cell factor-4 (Tcf-4) synergistically in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, but coexpression of Dvl-1-(Δ228–250), which lacks the amino acid region 228–250 from Dvl-1, and Frat-1 did not. Dvl-1, but not Dvl-1-(Δ228–250), acted synergistically with CKIε to activate Tcf-4. Depletion of CKIε by double-stranded RNA interference in HeLa S3 cells led to the inhibition of Wnt-3a-induced phosphorylation of Dvl and the binding of Dvl-1 to Frat-1. Furthermore, depletion of CKIε reduced the Wnt-3a-induced accumulation of β-catenin, although it did not affect the basal level of β-catenin. These results indicate that CKIε-dependent phosphorylation of Dvl enhances the formation of a complex of Dvl-1 with Frat-1 and that this complex leads to the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.

Wnt proteins constitute a large family of cysteine-rich secreted ligands that control development in organisms ranging from nematode worms to mammals (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the Wnt signaling pathway regulates axis formation, organ development, and cellular proliferation, morphology, motility, and fate (2Miller J.R. Hocking A.M. Brown J.D. Moon R.T.

Phosphorylated β-catenin forms a complex with Fbw1 (βTrCP/FWD1), which resides in an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (9Kitagawa M. Hatakeyama S. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Ishida N. Hattori K. Nakamichi I.

Ubiquitination of β-catenin induces its rapid proteosomal degradation (11Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3797-3804Crossref PubMed Scopus (2131) Google Scholar).When Wnt binds to the Frizzled/LRP co-receptor at the cell surface, a cytoplasmic protein, Dvl, antagonizes GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin. Once the phosphorylation of β-catenin is reduced, it dissociates from the Axin complex, and β-catenin is no longer degraded, resulting in its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Stabilized β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus, where it binds to transcriptional factors such as the Tcf/lymphoid enhancer binding factor and thereby stimulates the transcription of Wnt target genes (1Wodarz A. Nusse R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 59-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar,12Bienz M. Clevers H.

Three Dvl genes,Dvl-1, -2, and -3, have been isolated in mammals. Dvl homologs are conserved in Drosophila(Dishevelled, abbreviated Dsh) and Xenopus(Xenopus dishevelled, abbreviated Xdsh). All Dvl and Dsh family members contain the following three highly conserved domains: an N-terminal DIX domain; a central PDZ domain; and a DEP domain.

The Frat family consists of three members: Frat-1, -2, and -3. It has been shown that different sites of Frat-1 interact with GSK-3 and Dvl-1 and that Wnt-1 disintegrates the complex formation of Frat-1, Dvl-1, and Axin, resulting in the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway (21Li L.

However, how these three proteins, Dvl-1, CKIε, and Frat-1, functionally interact with one another to regulate the Wnt signaling pathway is not known.Here we demonstrate that CKIε enhances the binding of Dvl-1 and Frat-1 and that the interaction of Dvl-1 with Frat-1 is important for the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway.

Once the phosphorylation of β-catenin is reduced, it dissociates from the Axin complex, and β-catenin is no longer degraded, resulting in its accumulation in the cytoplasm. Stabilized β-catenin is translocated into the nucleus, where it binds to transcriptional factors such as the Tcf/lymphoid enhancer binding factor and thereby stimulates the transcription of Wnt target genes (1Wodarz A.

It is likely that amino acid residues other than those that mediate initial contact with agonist will be important for inducing gating transitions. Characterization of receptor-ligand interactions using site-directed mutagenesis and photolabeling studies provides limited information as to the state-dependent nature of ligand binding domains (1Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, identification of all residues lining the neurotransmitter binding-site, irrespective of the conformational state of the receptor, represents a critical step to understanding receptor-ligand interactions at allosteric proteins. Identification of amino acid residues important in agonist/antagonist binding at γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAAR)1 reveals that the GABA-binding sites are located at β-α subunit interfaces. Consistent with the agonist-binding site of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), the GABA-binding site is formed by amino acid residues clustered in non-continuous protein segments of the extracellular amino-terminal domains of adjacent subunits. Multiple residues have been implicated in the formation of this binding site using a variety of approaches, including site-directed mutagenesis, photoaffinity labeling, and the substituted-cysteine accessibility method (SCAM). These include Phe64, Arg66, Arg119, and Ile120 of the α1subunit (2Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Holden J.H.

Of these residues, it is likely that some contact agonist/antagonist molecules directly, some maintain the overall structure of the binding site, while others mediate conformational dynamics within the site during allosteric transitions among the resting, active, and desensitized states. The GABAAR α1 subunit segment between Pro174 and Asp191 is homologous in position to the putative “loop F” of the nAChR (see Fig. 1) (11Galzi J.-L. Revah F. Black D. Goeldner M. Hirth C. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10430-10437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of this segment of the nAChR γ/ε and δ subunits have identified negatively charged amino acid residues that influence acetylcholine binding, channel gating, and perhaps potassium ion interactions (see Fig. 1) (12Czajkowski C.

Vajsar J. Engel A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 483-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of a soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), a protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nAChR, the secondary structure of the loop F region is predicted to be a random coil (17Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the loop F protein sequence is poorly conserved among all GABAAR subunit isoforms and other related ligand-gated ion channel subunits and may represent a unique structural element that could account for differences in agonist affinity, dimensions of binding pockets, and access pathways important for receptor-ligand interactions. Therefore, an analysis of the structure and the role(s) of the α1 subunit Pro174–Asp191segment in ligand binding and ion channel activation is fundamental for understanding GABAAR function. The development of SCAM has proved to be very powerful tool for identifying residues important for the pharmacology of both agonists and antagonists. Originally developed to identify the channel-lining residues of ligand-gated ion channels (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), SCAM has gained widespread use in the study of the ligand binding domains of these channels (2Boileau A.J. Evers A.R.

The method entails introduction of successive cysteine residues, one at a time, within a protein domain and expression of recombinant receptors in heterologous systems. Solvent accessibility of a given cysteine is determined by monitoring changes in function following application of a sulfhydryl-specific modifying reagent (18Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). The role of a given residue in the formation of a ligand binding site is determined by the ability of both agonists and antagonists to impede modification of the introduced cysteine by the sulfhydryl-specific reagent. Here, we used SCAM to examine the structure, solvent accessibility, and dynamics of the GABAA receptor α1 subunit Pro174–Asp191 region, which comprises the putative loop F of the GABA binding pocket. We demonstrate that this region is highly accessible and adopts a random coil/turn conformation. In addition, we identify several residues, Val178, Val180, and Asp183, that likely participate in forming part of the GABA-binding pocket. Moreover, we provide evidence that this region of the receptor undergoes conformational rearrangements during pentobarbital-mediated gating of the channel. The results are discussed in terms of a homology model of the GABAAR agonist binding site, based on the recently solved crystal structure of the AChBP (17Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). Rat cDNAs for the α1 and β2 subunits of the GABAAreceptor were used in this study. The α1 cysteine mutants were engineered using a recombinant polymerase chain reaction method, as described previously (2Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 61-74Google Scholar, 26Kucken A.M. Wagner D.A. Ward P.R. Teissére J.A. Boileau A.J. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 932-947PubMed Google Scholar). Cysteine substitutions were made in the α1 subunit at Pro174, Ala175, Arg176, Ser177, Val178, Val179, Val180, Ala181, Glu182, Asp183, Gly184, Ser185, Arg186, Leu187, Asn188, Gln189, Tyr190, and Asp191 (Fig.1). Cysteine substitutions were verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and double-stranded DNA sequencing. All wild-type and mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the vector pGH19 (27Liman E.R. Tygat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 28Robertson G.A. Warmke J.M. Ganetzky B. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) for expression in Xenopus laevisoocytes. Oocytes were prepared as previously described (29Boileau A.J. Kucken A.M. Evers A.R. Czajkowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 295-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). cRNA transcripts were prepared using the T7 mMessage machine (Ambion). GABAA receptor β2 and α1 or α1 mutant subunits were co-expressed by injection of cRNA (200–800 pg/subunit) in a 1:1 ratio (α:β). The oocytes were maintained in ND96 medium (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1.8 CaCl2 and 5 HEPES, pH 7.4)and supplemented with 100 μg/ml gentamicin and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Oocytes were used 2–7 days after injection for electrophysiological recordings. Oocytes under two-electrode voltage clamp were perfused continuously with ND96 at a rate of ∼5 ml/min. The holding potential was −80 mV. The volume of the recording chamber was 200 μl. Standard two-electrode voltage clamp procedures were carried out using a GeneClamp500 Amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc.). Borosilicate electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of 0.5–3.0 MΩ in ND96. Stock solutions of GABA (Sigma) and SR-95531 (Sigma) were prepared in water, while N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (100 mm) (MTSEA-biotin, Biotium, Hayward, CA) was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). All compounds were prepared fresh daily and MTSEA-biotin was diluted appropriately in ND96 such that the final concentration of Me2SO was ≤2%. This solvent concentration did not affect recombinant GABAAR. To measure the sensitivity to GABA, the agonist (0.0001–1 mm) was applied via gravity perfusion or by pipettor application (∼5–8 s) with a 3–15-min washout period between each application to ensure complete recovery from desensitization. Peak GABA-activated current (IGABA) was recorded. To correct for slow drift in the maximum amplitude of the response as a function of time, concentration-response data were normalized to a low concentration of GABA (EC2–EC5). Concentration-response curves were generated for each recombinant receptor, and the data were fit by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software (San Diego, CA; graphpad.com). Data were fit to the following equation I =Imax/(1 + (EC50/[A])n), whereI is the peak amplitude of the current for a given concentration of GABA ([A]), Imaxis the maximum amplitude of the current, EC50 is the concentration required for half-maximal receptor activation, and n is the Hill coefficient. To measure the sensitivity to SR-95531, GABA (EC50) was applied via gravity perfusion followed by a brief (20 s) washout period before co-application of GABA (EC50) and increasing concentrations of SR-95531. The response to the application of SR-95531 and GABA was normalized to the response elicited by the agonist alone. Concentration-inhibition curves were generated for each recombinant receptor, and the data were fit by non-linear regression analysis using GraphPad Prism software. Data were fit to the following equation: 1 − 1/(1 + (IC50/[Ant])n), where IC50 is the concentration of antagonist ([Ant]) that reduces the amplitude of the GABA-evoked current by 50% and n is the Hill coefficient. KI values were calculated using the Cheng-Prussof correction:KI = IC50/(1 + ([A]/EC50)), where [A] is the concentration of GABA used in each experiment and EC50 is the concentration of GABA that elicits a half-maximal response for each receptor (30Cheng Y. Prussof W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12320) Google Scholar). MTSEA-biotin was the sulfhydryl-specific reagent used in this study. It is a relatively impermeant compound (31Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 296: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) with dimensions (14.5 Å unreacted moiety; 11.2 Å reacted moiety) that are similar to SR-95531 (13.5 Å) but much longer than GABA (4.5 Å). Methanethiosulfonate reagents react 109–1010times faster with the ionized thiolate (RS-) form of cysteine than the unionized form (32Roberts D.D. Lewis S.D. Ballou D.P. Olson S.T. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5595-5601Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Based on these properties, it is reasonable to assume that MTSEA-biotin can occupy the GABA-binding site and that this reagent will principally modify extracellular cysteine residues that are solvent-exposed. Oocytes expressing either wild-type or mutant receptors were activated by GABA (EC50) at regular intervals until the peak current amplitude varied by ≤10% on two consecutive applications. Oocytes were then allowed to fully recover, after which a high concentration of MTSEA-biotin (2 mm) was applied (2 min). Following MTSEA-biotin application, cells were washed (5 min) with ND96, after which GABA (EC50) was again applied to determine the effect of MTSEA-biotin application on IGABA. The effect of MTSEA-biotin was calculated as the difference in the amplitude of the IGABA before and after MTSEA-biotin application as follows: (IGABApre −IGABApost/IGABApre) × 100, where post refers to the amplitude ofIGABA following MTSEA-biotin application and pre refers to the amplitude of IGABAprior to exposure to MTSEA-biotin. Rates were measured only for those cysteine mutants that had a >40% change in IGABA following MTSEA-biotin treatment (2 min, 2 mm). The rate at which MTSEA-biotin modified introduced cysteine residues was measured using low MTSEA-biotin concentrations as described previously (3Holden J.H. Czajkowski C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18785-18792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In general, the concentration of MTSEA-biotin used was 50 μm, with the exception of A181C (500 nm) and R186C (5 μm). The experimental protocol is described as follows: GABA (EC50) application (5 s); ND96 wash-out (25 s); MTSEA-biotin application (10–20 s); ND96 washout (2.2–2.3 min). The sequence was repeated until IGABA no longer changed following the MTSEA-biotin treatment (i.e. the control reaction had proceeded to apparent completion). The individual abilities of GABA, SR-95531, and pentobarbital to alter the rate of cysteine modification by MTSEA-biotin were determined by co-applying either GABA (5 × EC50), SR-95531 (40 ×KI), or an activating concentration of pentobarbital (500 μm) during the MTSEA-biotin pulse. In all cases, the wash times were adjusted to ensure that currents obtained from test pulses of GABA (EC50) following exposure to high concentrations of GABA, SR-95531, or pentobarbital were stabilized. This ensured complete wash-out of drugs and that any reductions in the current amplitude were the result of MTSEA-biotin application. For all rate experiments, the decrease in IGABAwas plotted as a function of the cumulative time of MTSEA-biotin exposure and fit to a single-exponential decay function using GraphPad Prism software. A pseudo-first order rate constant (k1) was determined and the second order rate constant (k2) was calculated by dividingk1 by the concentration of MTSEA-biotin used in the assay (33Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Second order rate constants were determined using at least two different concentrations of MTSEA-biotin. log (EC50) and log (KI) values were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, followed by a post-hoc Dunnett's test to determine levels of significance between wild-type and mutant receptors. Differences among the second order (k2) rates of covalent modification of the various mutants were assessed using the false positive discovery rate method (34Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. Royal Statistical Soc., Series B, Methodological. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). This method limited the expected percent of false positives to 5%. The false positive discovery rate is a more meaningful measure of error in large screening experiments than the more traditional approach of limiting the probability of one or more false positives (also known as experiment-wise error control). Before analysis, the rates were transformed to a log scale to obtain more normally distributed residuals. Results are reported in the original scale. Even using this approach, clear trends in the data did not always achieve significance as has been noted in other large assays using SCAM (35Williams D.B. Akabas M.H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 7417-7424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mature protein sequences of the rat α1 and β2 subunits were homology-modeled with a subunit of the AChBP (17Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. van der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the AChBP was downloaded from the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (code 1I9B) and loaded into Swiss Protein Bank Viewer (SPDBV, ca.expasy.ord/spdbv). The α1protein sequence from Thr12–Ile227 and the β2 protein sequence from Ser10–Leu218 were aligned with the AChBP primary amino acid sequence as depicted in Cromer et al.(36Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and threaded onto the AChBP tertiary structure using the “Interactive Magic Fit” function of SPDBV. The threaded subunits were imported into SYBYL (Tripos, Inc., St. Louis, MO) where energy minimization was carried out (<0.5 kcal/Å). The first 100 iterations were carried out using Simplex minimization (37Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Teukolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes in C: the Art of Scientific Computing. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1988: 301-327Google Scholar) followed by 1000 iterations using the Powell conjugate gradient method (38Powell M.J.D. Mathematic. Program. 1977; 12: 241-251Crossref Scopus (1435) Google Scholar). A β2/α1 GABA-binding site interface was assembled by overlaying the monomeric subunits on the AChBP scaffold, the resulting structure was imported into SYBYL, and energy was minimized. Our model is quite similar to models recently published for the nAChR and GABAAR ligand binding domains (36Cromer B.A. Morton C.J. Parker M.W. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 280-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 39LeNovère N. Grutter T. Changeux J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2002; 99: 3210-3215Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). It is worth noting that positioning of the α1 subunit Pro174–Asp191 (loop F) region is inexact since the α1 subunit has low homology to AChBP sequence in this region and contains three additional amino acid residues. This region and other regions with insertions were modeled by fitting structures from a loop data base. Cysteine substitutions were engineered at eighteen individual positions in the GABAAR α1 subunit (Pro174, Ala175, Arg176, Ser177, Val178, Val179, Val180, Ala181, Glu182, Asp183, Gly184, Ser185, Arg186, Leu187, Asn188, Gln189, Tyr190, and Asp191) and co-expressed with wild-type β2subunits in X. laevis oocytes for functional analysis using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. Expression of most mutant subunits produced GABA-activated channels with the exceptions of L187C and Q189C (Fig. 2 and Table I). The lack of functional expression of receptors carrying the L187C and Q189C mutations may indicate a role for these residues in receptor synthesis/assembly as they are conserved in all GABAAR and glycine receptor subunits. Expression of D183C produced a significant 7-fold rightward shift in EC50relative to wild-type values (EC50 = 1.6 μm). However, the KI values for the competitive antagonist, SR-95531, for mutant receptors were not significantly different from wild-type values (KI = 330 nm). Hill coefficients were not significantly different from wild type (Table I). In general, the maximum current amplitude was 1–10 μA for wild-type and mutant receptors, with the exception of R186C (<300 nA).Table IConcentration-response data for GABA activation and SR-95531 inhibition of wild-type and mutant receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytesReceptorGABASR-95531EC50nHnmut/wtKInHnmut/wtμmμmα1β21.6 ± 0.51.50 ± 0.2310.33 ± 0.060.94 ± 0.0651α1(P174C)β25.9 ± 2.81.78 ± 0.633.70.06 ± 0.021.48 ± 0.2330.2α1(A175C)β24.3 ± 1.50.98 ± 1.532.70.10 ± 0.021.48 ± 0.0430.3α1(R176C)β21.7 ± 0.41.10 ± 0.231.10.20 ± 0.091.00 ± 0.0830.6α1(S177C)β26.0 ± 0.81.05 ± 0.233.80.08 ± 0.020.84 ± 0.1430.2α1(V178C)β24.7 ± 0.31.44 ± 0.142.90.10 ± 0.021.41 ± 0.3130.3α1(V179C)β24.4 ± 1.01.21 ± 0.332.80.13 ± 0.021.39 ± 0.2330.4α1(V180C)β22.3 ± 1.11.40 ± 0.331.40.05 ± 0.011.19 ± 0.0430.2α1(A181C)β21.9 ± 0.31.01 ± 0.431.20.14 ± 0.051.80 ± 0.5030.5α1(E182C)β22.6 ± 0.71.05 ± 0.331.60.08 ± 0.011.56 ± 0.1530.3α1(D183C)β211.0 ± 2.01.90 ± 0.346.9*0.42 ± 0.101.18 ± 0.3131.3α1(G184C)β21.9 ± 0.31.30 ± 0.131.20.12 ± 0.041.51 ± 0.3130.4α1(S185C)β25.5 ± 1.01.10 ± 0.233.40.90 ± 0.031.04 ± 0.0232.7α1(R186C)β27.1 ± 1.71.40 ± 0.134.41.30 ± 0.500.90 ± 0.0633.9α1(L187C)β2no expressionα1(N188C)β21.4 ± 0.41.10 ± 0.130.90.15 ± 0.031.25 ± 0.0930.5α1(Q189C)β2no expressionα1(Y190C)β21.6 ± 0.61.10 ± 0.2310.34 ± 0.071.18 ± 0.0831α1(D191C)β22.3 ± 1.11.50 ± 0.231.40.77 ± 0.201.27 ± 0.3032.3Data represent the mean ± S.E. for three to four experiments (n).

Open table in a new tab Data represent the mean ± S.E. for three to four experiments (n).

Hill slopes and log (EC50) values were analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance followed by a Dunnett's test to determine the levels of significance (*, p < 0.01). These data suggest that cysteine substitution within this domain of the GABAAR α1 subunit protein is well tolerated. A major assumption of SCAM is that the side chain of the introduced cysteine is in a similar position as the side chain of the native residue. Since GABA and SR-95531 bind equally well to both mutant and wild-type receptors, it is likely that the structures of the receptors are similar. To define the surface accessibility of the α1 subunit P174C-D191C segment, wild type and mutant receptors were exposed to MTSEA-biotin (2 mm) for 2 min (Fig. 3). MTSEA-biotin had no effect on wild-type receptors. MTSEA-biotin significantly reduced IGABA at P174C (60.5 ± 1.1%, n = 3), R176C (39.3 ± 6.3%, n = 3), S177C (72.4 ± 1.7%,n = 3), V178C (88.1 ± 3.2%, n = 4), V180C (65.2 ± 2.0%, n = 4), A181C (76.3 ± 2.0%, n = 4), D183C (46.0 ± 8.7%,n = 6) and R186C (44.8 ± 1.7%, n= 4). MTSEA-biotin potentiated IGABA at N188C (31.3 ± 10%, n = 3). An apparent lack of reaction (as in the case of A175C, V179C, E182C, and D191C) may indicate that no reaction has occurred or that the outcome of modification is functionally silent. It should be noted that most residues in this region were modified, although the magnitude of the effect of modification did not always achieve statistical significance (e.g. G184C, S185C, and Y190C). The pattern of solvent accessibility is not indicative of either a β-strand or an α-helix, suggesting that this domain of the GABAAR α1subunit adopts either a loop or a random coil conformation (Fig.6).Figure 6A, model of the GABA-binding site at the β−α subunit interface illustrating the random coil structure of the α1 subunit loop F protein segment.

This strategy was useful, but relatively large amounts of tissue extracts were required to monitor the biological activities. Another strategy involving the measurement of intracellular second messenger levels has often been adopted in recent purification studies, and two methods have been successful to date. The first method is to monitor the second messenger levels in intact cultured cells obtained from a particular organ. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide and adrenomedullin (AM)1 were identified by monitoring the adenylyl cyclase activity in the anterior pituitary cells (5Miyata A. Arimura A. Dahl R.R.

Orexins and ghrelin were purified by monitoring a transient intracellular calcium elevation in HEK293 cells expressing OX1R or OX2R receptor (7Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I.

Cherry W.R. Weaver G.W. In Vitro. 1976; 12: 670-677Google Scholar). Vasopressin, for example, strongly stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity in LLC-PK1 cells (10Gorbulev V. Buchner H. Akhundova A. Fahrenholz F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 1-7Google Scholar). Among three isotypes of the vasopressin receptor, members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family (11Morel A. O'Carroll A.M.

Nature. 1992; 357: 336-339Google Scholar) and participates in physiological events such as anti-diuresis. Calcitonin (CT) also potently increases the cAMP production in LLC-PK1 cells (15Wohlwend A. Vassalli J.D. Bertrand D. Orci L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 128: 71-75Google Scholar). CT is secreted mainly from the thyroid gland and is involved in calcium resorption in the bone (16Friedman J. Raisz L.G. Science. 1965; 150: 1465-1467Google Scholar, 17Aliapoulios M.A. Goldhaber P. Munson P.L. Science. 1966; 151: 330-331Google Scholar) as well as calcium reabsorption in the kidney (18Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F181-F198Google Scholar). The CT receptor is also a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, and its cDNA clone was first isolated from a cDNA library constructed from LLC-PK1cells (19Lin H.Y. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lodish H.F. Goldring S.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1022-1024Google Scholar).Although CT receptor is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), expression of CT has not been identified in the CNS (20Rosenfeld M.G. Mermod J.J. Amara S.G. Swanson L.W. Sawchenko P.E. Rivier J. Vale W.W. Evans R.M. Nature. 1983; 304: 129-135Google Scholar, 21Hoppener J.W. Steenbergh P.H. Moonen P.J. Wagenaar S.S. Jansz H.S. Lips C.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1986; 47: 125-130Google Scholar). The CT in the systemic circulation secreted from the thyroid gland is not considered to be incorporated into the CNS beyond the blood brain barrier. Although some investigators report that brain extracts contain biologically active CT-like materials (22Fischer J.A. Tobler P.H. Henke H. Tschopp F.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1983; 57: 1314-1316Google Scholar, 23Sexton P.M. Hilton J.M. Brain Res. 1992; 596: 279-284Google Scholar, 24Hilton J.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Pozvek G. Dowton M. Quiza M. Sexton P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 982-992Google Scholar), the existence of a cognate ligand to CT receptor in the CNS remains controversial. This was another reason we chose LLC-PK1 cells to screen biologically active peptides by monitoring the adenylyl cyclase activity.In this paper, we report the isolation and structural determination of a novel biologically active peptide from porcine brain extract by monitoring the cAMP production in LLC-PK1 cells. Although the purified peptide showed higher sequence homology to CGRP, this peptide bound to CT receptor with a higher affinity and stimulated cAMP production at a potency 350-fold greater than CT. Thus, we designated this peptide as calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide (CRSP). The findings obtained in this study strongly suggest that CRSP is a candidate for the unidentified ligand to CT receptor in the CNS and may participate in physiological events by activating the central as well as peripheral CT receptor.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, CRSP, from a porcine brain extract by monitoring the cAMP production in LLC-PK1 cells. Amino acid sequence analysis and molecular cloning of CRSP and its precursor protein showed that this peptide shows significant sequence similarity to CGRP. CGRP is a potent vasodilatory peptide, and two isoforms have to date been reported in humans and rodents (31Poyner D., R. Sexton P.M. Marshall I. Smith D.M. Quirion R. Born W. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Foord S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 233-246Google Scholar, 32Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Google Scholar, 33Amara S.G. Arriza J.L. Leff S.E. Swanson L.W. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1985; 229: 1094-1097Google Scholar, 34Steenbergh P.H. Hoppener J.W. Zandberg J. Lips C.J. Jansz H.S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 403-407Google Scholar). CGRP type-α was generated from tissue-specific alternative splicing of mRNA transcribed from the CT gene (32Amara S.G. Jonas V. Rosenfeld M.G. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Nature. 1982; 298: 240-244Google Scholar). On the other hand, ॆCGRP gene encodes a CT-like sequence that is not transcribed into mRNA (34Steenbergh P.H. Hoppener J.W. Zandberg J. Lips C.J. Jansz H.S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 403-407Google Scholar). Both genes have striking sequence similarity to each other. Because one form of CGRP corresponding to αCGRP has been identified in the pig, we first considered that CRSP was a porcine counterpart of the ॆCGRP. However, this peptide has a distinct structure, function, and distribution compared with those of α- and ॆCGRP as described below. Compared with the amino acid sequence of porcine CGRP, this peptide has 907 identity in the 10-amino acid sequence from the N terminus, and two cysteines that are deduced to form an intramolecular disulfide bond are conserved. On the other hand, only 407 identity between CRSP and CGRP was observed in the 10-amino acid sequence from the C terminus. In contrast, the amino acid sequences of human and porcine CGRPs are highly conserved throughout the molecule (Fig.3). CRSP stimulated cAMP production in LLC-PK1 cells about 300-fold more potently than porcine CGRP (Fig. 5a). CRSP also stimulated the cAMP production in COS-7 cells expressing recombinant CT receptor in a manner similar to that in LLC-PK1 cells. On the other hand, this peptide did not augment the cAMP production at all in either Hs68 or Swiss 3T3 cells, in which it was stimulated by CGRP and adrenomedullin. Both α- and ॆCGRP are reported to be abundantly expressed in the rat spinal cord (24Hilton J.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Pozvek G. Dowton M. Quiza M. Sexton P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 982-992Google Scholar). On the other hand, Northern blot analysis data shows that CRSP is expressed predominantly in the hypothalamus and poorly in the spinal cord (Fig. 4). Although CRSP has structural similarity to CGRP, several lines of evidence listed above indicate that CRSP has characteristics distinct from those of CGRP and elicits its effects via the CT receptor. Thus, we designated this peptide as calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide (CRSP).By searching CRSP or related peptides in the EST database, one candidate peptide, named CGRP-I, was found in horse. In horse, another peptide named CGRP-II has been identified, which has 97, 87, and 897 identity with porcine and human α- and ॆCGRP, respectively, and this peptide is considered to be a counterpart of CGRP. The equine CGRP-I gene encodes a peptide having 777 identity with porcine CRSP, which is ∼107 higher than that with porcine CGRP (677). In particular, the sequence identity between equine CGRP-I and porcine CRSP is 807 in the 10-amino acid sequence from the C terminus, whereas that between equine CGRP-I and porcine CGRP is only 307. The high identity in the N-terminal region and low identity in the C-terminal region is one of the features that differentiates CRSP from CGRP as described above. Because no corresponding gene has so far been found in humans and rodents by database searching, the peptides having high identity with CRSP might be limited to species evolutionarily close to pig. Further biochemical and pharmacological analyses using synthetic equine CGRP-I should be performed to determine whether it actually elicits CRSP-like effects.CGRP, CT, AM, and amylin, belonging to the CT and CGRP superfamily, are widely distributed in the CNS as well as in the peripheral tissues and induce multiple biological effects, including vasodilation, calcium resorption in bone, and reduction in nutrient intake (31Poyner D., R. Sexton P.M. Marshall I. Smith D.M. Quirion R. Born W. Muff R. Fischer J.A. Foord S.M. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 233-246Google Scholar). However, their receptor systems are more complex than other biologically active peptides. Recent studies have verified that the functional AM receptor and CGRP receptor consist of two membrane proteins, CL receptor, and one of three RAMPs (30Christopoulos G Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 235-242Google Scholar). CGRP is considered to stimulate cAMP production via a CL receptor-RAMP1 complex (30Christopoulos G Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 235-242Google Scholar), whereas AM is shown to increase the intracellular signal via a CL receptor-RAMP2 or a CL receptor-RAMP3 complex (28McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Google Scholar). Furthermore, later studies showed that the expression of RAMP3 facilitated amylin to bind and activate CT receptor (29Muff R. Buhlmann N. Fischer J.A. Born W. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2924-2927Google Scholar, 30Christopoulos G Perry K.J. Morfis M. Tilakaratne N. Gao Y. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Foord S.M. Sexton P.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 235-242Google Scholar). Although CRSP was found to stimulate CT receptor, these previous data indicated that the CRSP receptor should be characterized in detail in endogenous as well as recombinant systems. As shown in Fig. 5, CGRP and AM predominantly stimulated cAMP production in Hs68 and Swiss 3T3 cells, respectively, but CRSP did not alter the cAMP concentration in either of these cell lines. As clearly shown in Fig.7b, CRSP did not stimulate cAMP production at all via porcine CL receptor in the presence or absence of porcine RAMPs in the COS-7 cell expression system. These findings demonstrate that CRSP does not stimulate endogenous and recombinant AM/CGRP receptors, although this peptide has high structural similarity to CGRP. However, CRSP stimulated cAMP production in the COS-7 cells expressing the recombinant CT receptor more potently than porcine CT (Fig.7a), and co-expression of RAMPs did not alter the cAMP production level induced by CRSP stimulation (Fig. 7b). Binding of 125I-labeled porcine CT to the COS-7 cells expressing the recombinant CT receptor was prominently displaced by CRSP (Fig. 7c). The evidence described above indicate that both CRSP and CT can stimulate the CT receptor, although a detailed analysis of ligand-receptor interaction is required to understand how two structurally distinct peptides can bind to the same receptor.Bolus injection of CRSP into rats transiently reduced the plasma calcium concentration, although its effect was weaker than that of salmon and porcine CT (Fig. 6). At least two mechanisms have been elucidated for the plasma calcium reduction. 1) CT receptor is abundantly expressed on osteoclast cells (35Ikegame M. Rakopoulos M. Zhou H. Houssami S. Martin T.J. Moseley J.M. Findlay D.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1995; 10: 59-65Google Scholar). Treatment of resorbing bones with CT increases loss of the ruffled border of the osteoclast cells and decreases the release of lysosomal enzymes from them, which results in a reduction in the plasma calcium level (16Friedman J. Raisz L.G. Science. 1965; 150: 1465-1467Google Scholar, 17Aliapoulios M.A. Goldhaber P. Munson P.L. Science. 1966; 151: 330-331Google Scholar). 2) Renal tubular epithelia express CT receptor. The excretion of plasma calcium through the kidney is stimulated by CT by inhibiting renal tubular calcium reabsorption (18Friedman P.A. Gesek F.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F181-F198Google Scholar). As both osteoclast and renal epithelial cells express CT receptor, CRSP is deduced to activate CT receptor on these cells and decrease the plasma calcium concentration. In contrast to the potent effects of CRSP on cAMP production on LLC-PK1cells and COS-7 cells expressing CT receptor, the plasma calcium-reducing activity of CRSP is much weaker than that of porcine CT. The difference in the biological potency of CRSP in the in vivo and in vitro system may indicate the presence of unidentified physiological effects and mechanisms distinct from those of CT.The CT receptor is also expressed in the CNS at a high level (36Hilton J.M. Chai S.Y. Sexton P.M. Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 1223-1237Google Scholar) in addition to the peripheral system. Although CT receptor in the CNS has been recognized to be involved in the regulation of appetite (37Freed W.J. Perlow M.J. Wyatt R.J. Science. 1979; 206: 850-852Google Scholar), gastric acid secretion (38Morley J.E. Levine A.S. Silvis S.E. Science. 1981; 214: 671-673Google Scholar), and analgesic effect (39Montemurro L. Schiraldi G. Fraioli P. Tosi G. Riboldi A. Rizzato G. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1991; 49: 71-76Google Scholar), endogenous ligands for the CT receptor in the brain remain unidentified. In fact, CT is mainly synthesized and secreted from the thyroid gland but is almost undetectable in the CNS. The CT secreted from the thyroid and circulating in the blood is not considered to be incorporated into the CNS beyond the blood brain barrier. Several attempts have been made to identify an endogenous ligand that stimulates cAMP production via CT receptor in the CNS. Fischer et al. (22Fischer J.A. Tobler P.H. Henke H. Tschopp F.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1983; 57: 1314-1316Google Scholar) reported that human calcitonin- and C-terminal adjacent peptide-like immunoreactivities were found in extracts of the human periventricular mesencephalic region. Sexton and Hilton (23Sexton P.M. Hilton J.M. Brain Res. 1992; 596: 279-284Google Scholar) detect salmon CT-like immunoreactivity in rat brain using an anti-salmon CT antibody. This finding was supported by CT bioassays including cAMP production and receptor binding to culture cells and brain membranes. In 1998, these authors reported the successful purification of brain CT-like peptide with a molecular mass of 3267 Da, which was N-terminally blocked but had a unique 6-amino acid sequence of EKSQSP in the molecule (24Hilton J.M. Mitchelhill K.I. Pozvek G. Dowton M. Quiza M. Sexton P.M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 982-992Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no subsequent study has been reported for this peptide. In our study, the structure of CRSP was determined by direct analysis of the peptide purified from porcine brain extracts, and the sequence of prepro-CRSP was deduced from cDNA cloning and analysis. The CT-like biological activity was confirmed by the data showing that synthetic CRSP stimulated cAMP production via recombinant CT receptor and reduced the rat plasma calcium concentration by bolus administration. These findings suggest that this peptide with low amino acid sequence similarity with CT is a cognate ligand for CT receptor in the CNS, although it is necessary to examine whether a unique CRSP receptor that is more specific than CT receptor is present or not. Identification of CRSP in other species as well as the elucidation of its physiological effects and expression profiles in the CNS and peripheral system will clarify the relationship between CRSP and the previously reported CT-like peptide. Isolation and sequence determination of new biologically active peptides have greatly advanced our understanding of the communication between cells and tissues. Various biologically active peptides, such as natriuretic peptides (1Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 118: 131-139Google Scholar, 2Sudoh T. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H.

The CT receptor is also a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor family, and its cDNA clone was first isolated from a cDNA library constructed from LLC-PK1cells (19Lin H.Y. Harris T.L. Flannery M.S. Aruffo A. Kaji E.H. Gorn A. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lodish H.F. Goldring S.R. Science. 1991; 254: 1022-1024Google Scholar). Although CT receptor is expressed in the central nervous system (CNS), expression of CT has not been identified in the CNS (20Rosenfeld M.G. Mermod J.J. Amara S.G. Swanson L.W. Sawchenko P.E.

Although some investigators report that brain extracts contain biologically active CT-like materials (22Fischer J.A. Tobler P.H. Henke H. Tschopp F.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 982-992Google Scholar), the existence of a cognate ligand to CT receptor in the CNS remains controversial. This was another reason we chose LLC-PK1 cells to screen biologically active peptides by monitoring the adenylyl cyclase activity. In this paper, we report the isolation and structural determination of a novel biologically active peptide from porcine brain extract by monitoring the cAMP production in LLC-PK1 cells. Although the purified peptide showed higher sequence homology to CGRP, this peptide bound to CT receptor with a higher affinity and stimulated cAMP production at a potency 350-fold greater than CT. Thus, we designated this peptide as calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide (CRSP). The findings obtained in this study strongly suggest that CRSP is a candidate for the unidentified ligand to CT receptor in the CNS and may participate in physiological events by activating the central as well as peripheral CT receptor. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we isolated a novel peptide, CRSP, from a porcine brain extract by monitoring the cAMP production in LLC-PK1 cells. Amino acid sequence analysis and molecular cloning of CRSP and its precursor protein showed that this peptide shows significant sequence similarity to CGRP. CGRP is a potent vasodilatory peptide, and two isoforms have to date been reported in humans and rodents (31Poyner D., R. Sexton P.M. Marshall I. Smith D.M. Quirion R. Born W. Muff R. Fischer J.A.

https://openalex.org/W2107644307,"The type 1 insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is a receptor-tyrosine kinase that plays a critical role in signaling cell survival and proliferation. IGF-IR binding to its ligand, insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) activates phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), promotes cell proliferation by activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and blocks apoptosis by inducing the phosphorylation and inhibition of proapoptotic proteins such as BAD. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) that is required for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 activation in response to Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor stimulation, and for oxidative stress- and TNFα-induced apoptosis. The results presented here indicate that ASK1 forms a complex with the IGF-IR and becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) in a manner dependent on IGF-IR activity. IGF-IR signaling inhibited ASK1 irrespective of TNFα-induced ASK1 activation and resulted in decreased ASK1-dependent JNK1 stimulation. Signaling through IGF-IR rescued cells from ASK1-induced apoptotic cell death in a manner independent of PI3K activity. These results indicate that IGF-IR signaling suppresses the ASK-1-mediated stimulation of JNK/p38 and the induction of programmed cell death. The simultaneous activation of MAP kinases and the inhibition of the stress-activated arm of the cascade by IGF-IR may constitute a potent proliferative signaling system and is possibly a mechanism by which IGF-I can stimulate growth and inhibit cell death in a wide variety of cell types and biological settings.

In mammalian cells, the assembly of a signaling complex at the cytoplasmic domain of IGF-IR results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and its target, Akt/PKB (6Kulik G. Klippel A.

Activation of IGF-IR by its ligand also initiates metabolic cascades that result in the stimulation of protein synthesis, glucose intake, glycogen synthesis, and lipid storage. The MAPK signaling cascade is conserved in evolution and controls transcriptional responses to mitogenic or stress stimuli by the sequential activation of protein kinases. There are at least 6 independent MAPK signaling units described in mammals (11Ichijo H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6087-6093Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The pathways that culminate in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) and stress-activated protein kinases (SAPK/JNK and p38) have been characterized in some detail. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK1) is a MAPKKK that activates the JNK/p38 pathway in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and FasL (12Chang H.Y. Nishitoh H. Yang X. Ichijo H.

As for other MAPKKK, deletion of the N-terminal domain of ASK1 results in its constitutive activation, suggesting that the N terminus contains a regulatory domain (15Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M.

Also, ASK1-induced death in cultured cells requires either the deletion of its N-terminal domain (19Hatai T. Matsuzawa A. Inoshita S. Mochida Y. Kuroda T. Sakamaki K. Kuida K. Yonehara S. Ichijo H.

Moriguchi T. Takagi M. Matsumoto K. Miyazono K. Gotoh Y. Science. 1997; 275: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that a pathway activated by trophic factor(s) could thus negatively regulate ASK1 activity. Given that IGF-I is a potent activator of cell proliferation, and that in many cases it can replace serum to stimulate growth of cells in culture, we sought to investigate whether IGF-I signaling modulates ASK1 activity. The results presented here indicate that IGF-IR signaling inhibits ASK1 and relieves ASK1-induced apoptotic cell death. We found that ASK1 formed a complex with IGF-IR both in the presence and in the absence of exogenously added IGF-I and became phosphorylated on tyrosine residue(s) on its regulatory N-terminal domain in a manner dependent on IGF-IR kinase activity. IGF-IR signaling inhibited ASK1 activation in the presence of TNF-α and attenuated ASK1-dependent JNK1 stimulation. We propose that one of the mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective activity of IGF-I signaling may involve the down-regulation of the stress-activated arm of the MAP kinase cascade through the phosphorylation and inhibition of ASK1. Unless indicated otherwise, human embryonic kidney 293 and L929 cells were grown in 60-, 100-, or 150-mm dishes at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin (Cellgro). 293 cells grown in 60- or 100-mm dishes were transiently transfected with 3–5 or 6–8 μg of the indicated plasmid constructs, respectively, using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and maintained in serum-free medium for the duration of the experiment. Lysates were collected 13–15 h after transfection. 8–10-h post-transfection, cultures of 293 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of recombinant TNFα (Sigma) for 20 min. In all transfection experiments, the amount of plasmid DNA transfected was equalized by the addition of pcDNA3.1 vector DNA. For the analysis of endogenous proteins, 8–10 150-mm dishes of L929 cells were incubated in serum-free media for 2 h and then either left untreated or treated with 200 nm wortmannin (Sigma) 20 min prior and during treatment with 100 ng/ml purified IGF-I (Sigma) for 10 additional minutes. Hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type and kinase-mutant human ASK1 (ASK1-HA and ASK1KD-HA) and the glutathione S-transferase fusion of MKK6KD were described previously (16Ichijo H. Nishida E.

The ASK1Y574A-HA construct was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using primers CCAACCAAAATCTATCAACCTTCTGCTTTGTCTATCAACAATGAAGTTGAGG and CCTCAACTTCATTGTTGATAGACAAAGCAGAAGGTTGATAGATTTTGGTTGG and a modification of the Stratagene's QuikChange protocol.

Plasmids containing the FLAG-tagged human JNK1 open reading frame under the regulation of the cytomegalovirus promoter have been described (26Abe K. Kurakin A. Mohseni-Maybodi M. Kay B.

Anti-HA antibodies (HA.11) were purchased from BabCO. Anti-IGF-IR (C-20), anti-ASK1 (N-19), anti-ASK1 (H-300), and protein A/G-Sepharose were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Purified anti-human JNK1/JNK2 and anti-JNK1 were purchased from BD PharMingen. All horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, FITC-conjugated anti-goat and Texas Red-conjugated anti-rabbit were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories and AP-conjugated anti-rabbit and AP-conjugated anti-mouse were purchased from Promega. Antiphospho-SAPK/JNK(Thr-183/Tyr-185) and antiphospho-tyrosine were purchased from Cell Signaling. Cells were collected, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and disrupted in lysis buffer (1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 3 mm dithiothreitol with the addition of Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). In immunoprecipitation experiments involving L929 cells, 1% Triton X-100 was replaced by 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% Triton X-100. Lysates were spun at 16,000 × g, supernatants were precleared by incubation with protein A/G-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C, and proteins were immunoprecipitated by incubation in appropriate antibodies followed by protein A/G PLUS-agarose. Pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer and then twice with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 20 mm β-glycerophosphate). Complexes were disrupted in Laemmli buffer (Invitrogen) and resolved in 7%, 3–8% Tris acetate gels or in 10% NuPage gels (Invitrogen). The separated polypeptides were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher and Schuell), blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) and detected using Kodak Biomax MR film (Kodak Eastman). Cells were disrupted in lysis buffer as described above and clarified with proteinA/G PLUS-agarose. Proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated as described above. The beads were washed three times in kinase buffer and incubated in the presence of 20 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2.5 μg of either GST-MKK6KM or myelin basic protein (Sigma). Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer, and the products were resolved in gels, which were dried and exposed to film or analyzed in a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). In all experiments, both the extent of phosphorylation and the amount of protein determined by Western blotting were determined with ImageQuant software. GST-MKK6KM was expressed in BL21 cells together with a thioredoxin-expressing vector to enhance solubility of the fusion protein and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitated ASK1-HA or ASK1KM-HA were incubated with 20 μm ATP, 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and immunoprecipitated IGF-IR in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. 32P incorporation was assessed by gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. Proteins were visualized using Coomassie Blue staining. 293 cells were grown on 22-mm square coverslips and treated as indicated. Cells were then fixed by immersion in −20 °C methanol for 20 min and blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) in 1% bovine serum albumin in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then incubated in goat anti-ASK1 (N-19) and rabbit anti-IGF-IR (C-20) in 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with FITC-conjugated, donkey anti-goat and Texas Red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed extensively (8–10 times, 15 min) with phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature and mounted in DAPI-Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Wide-field images were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse-800 microscope and appropriate filters and collected using Compix Simple PCI software. Images were then processed in a SGI Octane R12 computer running Bitplane's Advanced Imaging Software suite. Briefly, deconvolution was done using a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm with Huygens software and then processed by the Imaris imaging interphase (Bitplane AG). Percentages of apoptotic cells in cultures were determined by standard propidium iodide (PI) staining protocols and flow cytometry (27Darzynkiewicz Z. Li X. Gong J. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 15-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) 60 h after transfection. IGF-IR-expressing cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I and 200 nm wortmannin 12 h after transfection as indicated and maintained in their presence for the duration of the experiment. Fresh IGF-I was added to the cultures every 8 h. Given that maximal activation of ASK1 in cultured cells is achieved when cultures are maintained in the absence of serum, we hypothesized that a pathway activated by trophic factor(s) could negatively regulate ASK1 activity. IGF-I is a potent activator of cell proliferation and in many cases it can replace serum to stimulate growth of cells in culture. We therefore asked whether IGF-I would be sufficient to decrease ASK1 activity in serum-deprived L929 cells. The activity of ASK1 was reduced 40% in L929 cells grown in 10% serum in comparison to L929 cells maintained in the absence of serum (Fig.1, panels A and B). IGF-I treatment of serum-starved L929 cells decreased the activity of ASK1 to levels identical to those observed in cultures treated with 10% serum, implying that the inhibition of ASK1 activity by serum may be attributed to the effect of IGF-I. Recently, Chao and co-workers (28Kim A.H. Khursigara G. Sun X. Franke T.F. Chao M.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 893-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar) showed that ASK1 can be inhibited by Akt, a serine/threonine kinase that is activated by PI3K and has a crucial role in the signal transduction pathway initiated by IGF-I. To determine the contribution of Akt to the decrease in ASK1 activity induced by IGF-I, we incubated serum-starved, IGF-I-stimulated cells in the presence of wortmannin, a potent PI3K inhibitor. Inhibition of PI3K signaling did not have a significant effect on the decrease in ASK1 activity resulting from IGF-I stimulation of serum-starved cells (Fig. 1, panel B). In some experiments, we observed a moderate decrease in ASK1 activity in the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 1, panel A). This could be caused by a general effect of wortmannin on protein synthesis, even at the relatively short incubation times used in these experiments. Given that Akt activation was effectively inhibited by wortmannin in IGF-I-stimulated L929 cells (not shown), we concluded that the inhibition of ASK1 by IGF-I occurred, at least partially, upstream or independently of PI3K. Next, we transiently expressed a human ASK1 complementary DNA (cDNA) tagged with a hemagglutinin epitope (ASK1-HA) in the presence of a kinase-competent, full-length human IGF-IR cDNA (IGF-IR), a kinase-competent, myristylated intracellular domain of the IGF-IR β-chain (IGF-IRIC), or a kinase-inactive form of the myristylated IGF-IR intracellular domain (IGF-IRK) in 293 cells. As reported previously (3Liu J.P. Baker J. Perkins A.S. Robertson E.J. Efstratiadis A. Cell. 1993; 75: 59-72Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2561) Google Scholar), ectopically expressed ASK1-HA showed high constitutive activity in in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 1, panel C). We observed variability in ASK1-HA protein levels when it was expressed in cells in the presence of IGF-IR; therefore, to determine whether ASK1-HA activity was affected by IGF-IR signaling independent of variations in ASK1-HA protein levels, we determined the ratio between ASK1-HA kinase activity by radionuclide labeling and phosphorimager analysis and the densitometric values of ASK1-HA protein by immunoblot in cells expressing ASK1-HA in the presence of different forms of IGF-IR. ASK1 specific activity was decreased in the presence of full-length IGF-IR (Fig. 1, panel D). IGF-IRIC, which showed high constitutive kinase activity (Fig. 2, panel D and data not shown), further inhibited both ASK1 autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein by ASK1 (Fig. 1,panels C and D). This effect was partially abolished by mutation of the ATP binding site in the IGF-IR kinase domain. Mutation of lysine 1003 to arginine in the ATP binding site of the receptor has been shown to abolish its kinase activity (29Fernandez A.M. Kim J.K. Yakar S. Dupont J. Hernandez-Sanchez C. Castle A.L. Filmore J. Shulman G.I. Le Roith D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1926-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The partial (rather than complete) restoration of ASK1 kinase activity observed in the presence of the kinase-inactive form of the IGF-IR intracellular domain suggests that a kinase-independent mechanism for ASK1 inhibition by IGF-IR may exist. Given that the inhibition of ASK1 by IGF-I stimulation in L929 cells was only partially abolished by treatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin, we hypothesized that ASK1 was inhibited at a step upstream or independently of PI3K, possibly by the activated IGF-IR itself. To test this idea, we determined whether ASK1 was phosphorylated on Tyr. A decrease in the electrophoretic mobility of the ASK1-HA band in gradient gels was observed in the presence of kinase-active forms of the IGF-IR, but not when a kinase-inactive form of IGF-IR was used (Fig. 2, panel A). The slower migrating ASK1-HA forms were phosphotyrosine immunoreactive (Fig. 2, panel B). No phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity could be observed in ASK1-HA when it was expressed in the presence of a kinase-inactive form of the IGF-IRβ chain intracellular domain (Fig. 2, panel B). IGF-I stimulation of cells expressing full-length IGF-IR did not significantly increase ASK1-HA phosphotyrosine immunoreactivity, suggesting that transiently expressed IGF-IR may signal in the absence of exogenous IGF-I stimulation. To determine whether transiently expressed IGF-IR may become active in the absence of exogenously added serum or IGF-I, we assayed IGF-IR complexes immunoprecipitated from 293 cells in in vitro kinase assays and found that these complexes were able to transphosphorylate in vitro (data not shown). These observations suggest that IGF-IR may form kinase-active complexes when transiently expressed in 293 cells in the absence of ligand binding. Even though survival of 293 cell cultures requires the addition of serum or IGF-I to the media, we cannot rule out the possibility that suboptimal amounts of IGF-I may be produced by 293 cells maintained in serum-free conditions for the duration of the transient transfection experiments described in these studies, ∼12 h. We concluded that ASK1 is phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue in a manner dependent on IGF-IR activity and independent of exogenously added IGF-I. To determine whether ASK1 is a direct substrate for IGF-IR, we immunoprecipitated ectopically expressed IGF-IR, the intracellular domain of the IGF-IRβ chain and a kinase-mutant form of ASK1-HA from 293 cells and performed in vitro kinase assays in the presence of 32P-labeled γ−ATP. A kinase-mutant form of ASK1-HA (ASK1KM-HA), which possesses no detectable kinase activity (Fig. 2C, right panel), was labeled with32P when IGF-IR or the kinase-competent intracellular domain of the receptor's β-chain were present in the reaction (Fig.2C, left panel), suggesting that IGF-IR can phosphorylate ASK1 in vitro. Kinase-active ASK1-HA was included in the experiments as a control for the kinase reaction and to indicate the position of migration of 32P-labeled ASK1-HA protein bands in gels. Because the detection of a complex formed by IGF-IR and ASK1 would provide additional support for the notion that ASK1 is a substrate of the IGF-IR, we performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation experiments using lysates from L929 cells maintained in the presence of 10% serum or deprived of serum with and without IGF-I stimulation. We found that the β-chain of IGF-IR was present in complexes immunoprecipitated with an anti-ASK1 antibody in extracts from L929 cells maintained both in the presence and in the absence of serum (Fig. 3,panel A). A relative increase in the amount of IGF-IR β-chain present in complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-ASK1 was observed in lysates from serum-starved L929 cells. Given that ASK1 is a cytoplasmic protein, we next asked whether the interaction of ASK1 with IGF-IR involved the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor's β-chain, which encompasses its kinase domain. ASK1-HA was transiently expressed in 293 cells together with IGF-IR or with kinase-active and kinase-inactive forms of the IGF-IR β-chain intracellular domain and reciprocal immunoprecipitations were performed. Both a kinase-active and a kinase-inactive form of the IGF-IR β-chain, as well as the full-length receptor, were found in complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 3,panel B). Conversely, complexes immunoprecipitated with anti-IGF-IR antibodies contained ASK1-HA (Fig. 3, panel C). These results indicate that the interaction between ASK1 and the IGF-IR involves the cytoplasmic portion of the IGF-IR β-chain. Consistent with the constitutive nature of the interaction between the endogenous ASK1 and IGF-IR in L929 cells, the formation of IGF-IR/ASK1 complexes was not affected by mutation of the ATP-binding site in the IGF-IR kinase domain. It has been shown that the mechanism of ASK1 activation involves, in part, stimulus-dependent homo-oligomerization (30Liu H. Nishitoh H. Ichijo H. Kyriakis J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2198-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the interaction with IGF-IR blocks ASK1 homo-oligomerization and activation, and may explain why kinase-mutant forms of IGF-IR partially retained the ability to inhibit ASK1 (Fig. 1,panels C and D). We then sought to determine the subcellular localization of the interaction between ASK1 and IGF-IR. The two proteins were found in structures adjacent to the nucleus of 293 cells ectopically expressing ASK1 and the IGF-IR precursor (Fig. 3D, upper panels). The presence of ASK1/IGF-IR complexes in perinuclear structures may reflect the accumulation of immature forms of IGF-IR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment and their interaction with ASK1, which is associated with components of the unfolded protein response machinery that assembles at the ER membrane (31Nishitoh H. Matsuzawa A. Tobiume K. Saegusa K. Takeda K. Inoue K. Hori S. Kakizuka A. Ichijo H. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1345-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). In agreement with the observation that the intracellular domain of IGF-IR mediates its interaction with ASK1, we found that IGF-IRIC colocalized with ASK1 in a compartment juxtaposed to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane in 293 cells in a manner independent of its kinase activity (Fig. 3D, middle and lower panels). It has been shown that the N-terminal domain"

The association between PP2Cε and TAK1 was transiently suppressed by IL-1 treatment of the cells. Taken together, these results suggest that, in the absence of IL-1-induced signal, PP2Cε contributes to keeping the TAK1 signaling pathway in an inactive state by associating with and dephosphorylating TAK1.AY184801 Although TAK1 signaling plays essential roles in eliciting cellular responses to interleukin-1 (IL-1), a proinflammatory cytokine, how the IL-1-TAK1 signaling pathway is positively and negatively regulated remains poorly understood.

SAPKs relay signals in response to various extracellular stimuli, including environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines. In mammalian cells, two distinct classes of SAPKs have been identified, the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p38α, p38ॆ, p38γ, and p38δ) (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). Activation of SAPKs requires phosphorylation of conserved tyrosine and threonine residues present in the catalytic domain. This phosphorylation is mediated by dual specificity protein kinases, which are members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK) family. Of these, MKK3 and MKK6 phosphorylate p38, MKK7 phosphorylates JNK, and MKK4 can phosphorylate either. These MKKs, in turn, are similarly activated by the phosphorylation of conserved serine and threonine residues (1Garrington T.P. Johnson G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 211-218Google Scholar, 2Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Google Scholar). Recently, several MKK-activating MKK kinases have been identified (3Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Google Scholar). Some of these MKK kinases are also known to be activated by phosphorylation. In the absence of a signal, the constituents of the SAPK cascade return to their dephosphorylated, inactive state, suggesting an essential role for phosphatases in SAPK regulation. Protein phosphatases are classified into three groups, Ser/Thr phosphatases, Ser/Thr/Tyr phosphatases, and Tyr phosphatases, depending on their phosphoamino acid specificity. Dephosphorylation of SAPK signal pathway components requires the participation of a variety of phosphatases. In fact, participation by members of all three groups in the negative regulation of SAPK signaling pathways has been reported (4Tamura S. Hanada M. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 1060-1066Google Scholar). PP2C is one of four major protein serine/threonine phosphatases (PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C) found in eukaryotes. At least six distinct PP2C gene products (2Cα, 2Cॆ, 2Cγ, 2Cδ, Wip1, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase phosphatase) have been found in mammalian cells (5Tamura S. Lynch K.R. Larner J.

Of the six different members of the PP2C family, three (PP2Cα, PP2Cॆ, and Wip1) have recently been implicated in the negative regulation of SAPK signaling pathways (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Google Scholar,17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S.

We and others have reported that ectopic expression of mouse PP2Cα or PP2Cॆ-1 inhibited the stress-activated MKK3/6-p38 and MKK4/7-JNK pathways but not the mitogen-activated MKK1-ERK1 pathway (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Google Scholar, 17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Google Scholar). Thus, negative regulation by PP2Cα and PP2Cॆ-1 is selective for SAPK pathways. We have provided further evidence indicating that PP2Cॆ-1 associates with another upstream kinase, TAK1, and inhibits the SAPK signaling pathways by direct dephosphorylation of TAK1 (18Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Google Scholar). Takekawa et al. (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Google Scholar) have found that PP2Cα-2 dephosphorylates and inactivates MKK4, MKK6 and p38, both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, they reported that Wip1, whose expression is induced by ionizing radiation in a p53-dependent manner, inactivates p38 by specific dephosphorylation of a conserved threonine residue and suppresses subsequent p53 activation (10Fiscella M. Zhang H. Fan S. Sakaguchi K. Shen S. Mercer W.E. Vande Woude G.F. O'Connor P.M. Appella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6048-6053Google Scholar, 19Takekawa M. Adachi M. Nakahata A. Nakayama I. Itoh F. Tsukuda H. Taya Y. Imai K. EMB0 J. 2000; 19: 6517-6526Google Scholar). TAK1 was originally identified as a MKK kinase that functions in the transforming growth factor-ॆ signaling pathway (21Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Oishi I. Ueno N. Taniguchi T. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1995; 270: 2008-2011Google Scholar). TAK1 can activate both the MKK4-JNK and MKK6-p38 pathways (18Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Google Scholar). Studies of the mechanism of transforming growth factor-ॆ-induced activation of TAK1 have revealed that a TAK1-binding protein, TAB1, functions as an activator promoting TAK1 autophosphorylation (22Shibuya H. Yamaguchi K. Shirakabe K. Tonegawa A. Gotoh Y. Ueno N. Irie K. Nishida E. Matsumoto K. Science. 1996; 272: 1179-1182Google Scholar, 23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Google Scholar). Recent studies have indicated that TAK1 is also activated by various stimuli, including environmental stress and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor α), and TAB2, another TAK1 binding protein, has been found to link TAK1 and TRAF6 and acts as a mediator of TAK1 action in the IL-1-induced signaling pathway (24Shirakabe K.

In this study, we present evidence that a novel member of the PP2C family (PP2Cε) participates in the negative regulation of the TAK1 signaling pathway and suggest that PP2Cε is involved in the IL-1-induced regulation of TAK1. Restriction enzymes and other modifying enzymes used for DNA manipulation were obtained from Takara (Kyoto, Japan). Glutathione-agarose beads, protein A-agarose beads, Hybond-P membranes, Hybond-N+ membranes, [γ-32P]ATP, and RedivueTML [35S]methionine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.

The luciferase assay, ॆ-galactosidase enzyme assay, and TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems were supplied by Promega(Madison, WI). Amylose resin and anti-MBP antibody were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-hemagglutinin antibody (HA; 12CA5) and human IL-1ॆ were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-phospho-JNK, anti-phospho-p38, anti-phospho-MKK4, and anti-phospho-MKK3/6 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling(Beverly, MA). Anti-TAK1, anti-Myc, and anti-His antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems (New Haven, CT). All other reagents used were from Wako Pure Chemical (Osaka, Japan). We searched the expressed sequence tag data base for DNA clones encoding the amino acid sequences of the unique motifs conserved in mouse PP2C family members. Three different clones, each potentially encoding a novel member of the PP2C family, were found. These three cDNAs were designated clone-1, -2 (to be published elsewhere), and -3 (to be published elsewhere). A putative full-length cDNA of clone-1 was obtained by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods using the total RNA fraction isolated from the hearts of adult mice as the template. Nucleotide sequence data for the full-length cDNA are available in the GenBankTM data base under the accession numberAY184801. This sequence has been scanned against the data base, and all sequences with significant relatedness to the new sequence were identified (BF466920, BB611990, BB636411, BU052859, BB611559, AI613837,BM876958, AF117832, BF471931, AA509367, BE980311, BF464085, AA498729,AI481407, BG296608, BE948499, BB628580, BF465398, BB643596, BE983821,BB866395, BB662653, BB622909, BI220774, BE859571). Plasmids expressing PP2C, TAK1, TAB1, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and MKKs in mammalian cells were constructed using cDNAs encoding these proteins, under the control of the CMV promoter. Epitope tags were added to the constructs using synthesized oligonucleotides. Mutated cDNAs were generated by polymerase chain reactions. For bacterial expression of proteins, cDNAs encoding the proteins were subcloned into pGEX (Amersham Biosciences) or into pMAL-C2X (New England Biolabs) to generate glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins or maltose-binding protein (MBP) fusion proteins. Other expression plasmids were prepared as described elsewhere (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Google Scholar, 26Kusuda K. Kobayashi T. Ikeda S.

TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation Systems (Promega) were used to determine the start codon of PP2Cε cDNA. 293 cells and 293IL-1RI (27Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Google Scholar) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 (v/v) fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. At ∼50–707 confluence the cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate transfection method or using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The total amount of DNA used for transfection was 1 ॖg per 12-well plate, 2 ॖg/6-cm plate, and 10 ॖg/10-cm plate. After transfection, the cells were cultured for 48 h and harvested. α-Casein was phosphorylated by protein kinase A and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (28Tamura S. Kikuchi K. Hiraga A. Hosokawa M. Tsuiki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 349-356Google Scholar, 29McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-425Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A was purified as described by Reimann and Beham (30Reimann E.M. Beham R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 51-55Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was gel-filtered by Sephadex G-25 and the isolated32P-labeled casein was stored at −20 °C before use. To obtain 32P-labeled TAK1, 293 cells (2 × 106) were cotransfected with 5 ॖg of pcDNA3-HA-TAK1 and 5 ॖg of pcDNA3-HA-TAB1, using the calcium phosphate transfection method. The cell lysates were prepared 48 h after the transfection, and the TAK1-TAB1 complex was immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). After immunoprecipitation, the beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.057 (v/v) Tween 20 and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 30 min at 30 °C. The immune complex containing the autophosphorylated TAK1 was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and subsequently with phosphatase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.017 (v/v) Brij 35, and 2 mm MnCl2). Aliquots were stored at −20 °C before use. In order to prepare the phosphorylated JNK, 2 ॖg of pcDNA3-Myc-JNK was transfected into 293 cells (2 × 105) using LipofectAMINE. IL-1 (500 units/ml) was added to the medium 48 h after the transfection, and the cells were incubated for 15 min. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 17 (v/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads. The immune complex was washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.057 (v/v) Tween 20 and then with the kinase buffer and stored in aliquots at −20 °C before use. In order to prepare the GST-phospho-MKK4, pEBG2T-MKK4, pcDNA3-HA-TAK1, and pcDNA3-HA-TAB1 were cotransfected into 293 cells. The cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection, and the GST-phospho-MKK4 was isolated from the cell lysates with glutathione-Sepharose beads. The phosphorylated GST-MKK4 was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm glutathione, 0.25m sucrose, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm EGTA) and stored at −20 °C before use. Casein phosphatase activity was assayed by measuring the release of [32P]phosphate from 32P-labeled casein, essentially as described previously (28Tamura S. Kikuchi K. Hiraga A. Hosokawa M. Tsuiki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 524: 349-356Google Scholar). TAK1 phosphatase activity was determined by incubating the 32P-labeled TAK1 with the indicated amounts of recombinant MBP-PP2Cε or MBP-PP2Cॆ-1 in phosphatase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-sample buffer, and the reaction mixture was subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. To determine the JNK phosphatase activity, the phosphorylated JNK was incubated with the indicated amounts of recombinant MBP-PP2Cε, together with recombinant GST-c-Jun and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5–3 ॖCi) in the kinase buffer. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. In order to determine the MKK4 phosphatase activity, the phospho-MKK4 was incubated with the recombinant MBP-PP2Cε for 30 min at 30 °C in phosphatase buffer. The proteins in the reaction mixture were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-phospho-MKK4 and anti-MBP antibodies. Cells transfected with the indicated expression plasmids were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the indicated antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to 107 (w/v) SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight with the primary antibodies at 4 °C, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at 25 °C, and developed by chemiluminescence using CDP-Star as the substrate. Total RNA was extracted from the mouse tissues with RNAzol B (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.). The denatured RNA (15 ॖg) was electrophoresed in a 1.07 (w/v) agarose gel and transferred onto a Hybond-N+ membrane, and Northern hybridization was carried out as described previously (15Terasawa T. Kobayashi T. Murakami T. Ohnishi M. Kato S. Tanaka O. Kondo H. Yamamoto H. Takeuchi T. Tamura S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 307: 342-349Google Scholar). A32P-labeled probe representing the entire coding sequence of the PP2Cε cDNA was used for the hybridization. A reporter gene activity assay was performed as described previously (18Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Google Scholar, 32Beltman J. Erickson J.R. Martin G.A. Lyons J.F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3772-3780Google Scholar). The pGL3-AP-1/luciferase reporter gene was used to measure AP-1-dependent transcriptional activity. Luciferase activity was determined with a luciferase assay system (Promega). A ॆ-galactosidase reporter plasmid, under the control of a ॆ-actin promoter, was cotransfected to normalize the transfection efficiency. The obtained cDNA clone (clone-1) contained a single oligonucleotide of 1566 bp (Fig.1A). The first Met codon and the first stop codon downstream were at nucleotide 238 and 1318, respectively. However, the fourth Met codon at nucleotide 409 was in the context of the translational start consensus sequence (A at −3 and G at +4, where the A in ATG is +1) (33Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed an in vitro translation of the cDNA clone to determine which Met was the actual translational initiation codon. The largest size of the proteins synthesized in vitro was 34 kDa (Fig.1B). This size matched that of the protein from the fourth Met codon, which is composed of 303 amino acids. The bands of the smaller sizes may presumably be the proteolytic products of the 34-kDa protein. Therefore, we tentatively concluded that the open reading frame resided between 409 and 1318 nt. The primary sequence contained six motifs commonly conserved in PP2C family members in addition to a basic amino acid cluster unique to this 34-kDa protein (34Pilgrim D. McGregor A. Jackle P. Johnson T. Hansen D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1159-1171Google Scholar). This suggested that the encoded protein was a novel PP2C family member, and it was designated PP2Cε. Overall, the homogeneity between PP2Cα and PP2Cε was 267. To determine whether the recombinant PP2Cε possessed protein phosphatase activity, MBP-PP2Cα or MBP-PP2Cε fusion proteins were expressed inE. coli and then purified with amylose resin. The purified MBP-PP2Cε fusion protein exhibited substantial Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent and okadaic acid-insensitive protein phosphatase activity (data not shown). The specific activity of MBP-PP2Cε was similar to that of MBP-PP2Cα when phosphorylated α-casein was used as the substrate (data not shown). Northern hybridization was performed on mouse tissues to clarify the tissue distribution of PP2Cε mRNA. A strong signal of 5.9-kb mRNA was observed in the brain, and a weak signal corresponding to the same size was also found in the heart (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, a mRNA signal of 2.2 kb was observed only in the testis (Fig. 1C). Although the PP2Cε mRNA signal was not observed in liver, lung, or skeletal muscle by Northern blot analysis, we were able to detect the PP2Cε mRNA signal in these tissues by polymerase chain reaction, suggesting that PP2Cε mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in a variety of tissues (data not shown). Three distinct PP2C family members (PP2Cα, PP2Cॆ, and Wip1) have previously been implicated in the regulation of the SAPK systems (14Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Google Scholar, 17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Google Scholar, 18Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Google Scholar, 19Takekawa M. Adachi M. Nakahata A. Nakayama I. Itoh F. Tsukuda H. Taya Y. Imai K. EMB0 J. 2000; 19: 6517-6526Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that PP2Cε was also involved in the regulation of SAPK signaling pathways. In 293 cells, IL-1 stimulates the activity of the transcription factor complex AP-1 through the activation of TAK1 and JNK (35Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J-I. Cao Z. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 398: 252-256Google Scholar). We transfected 293 IL-1RI cells, which express the IL-1 receptor, with the expression plasmid of PP2Cε and then assayed the AP-1 activity using an AP-1-dependent luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 2A). Similar to our previously reported data with transfected PP2Cॆ-1 (18Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Google Scholar), PP2Cε inhibited the IL-1-induced activation of AP-1 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). We next asked whether the TAK1-induced activation of AP-1 is also affected by the co-expression of PP2Cε (Fig. 2B). The expression of TAK1 alone in 293 IL-1RI cells activated the AP-1 reporter gene. This enhanced activity was substantially suppressed by PP2Cε, suggesting that TAK1 itself or a component(s) that lies downstream of TAK1 is a substrate of PP2Cε. Since TAK1 activates both JNK and p38 signaling pathways via MKK4/7 and MKK3/6, respectively, we also tested whether TAK1-induced activation of JNK or p38 was suppressed by PP2Cε. We expressed Myc-JNK (Fig.2C) or FLAG-p38 (Fig. 2D) with HA-TAK1 in 293 cells and tested the effect of PP2Cε co-expression on the TAK1-enhanced activation of JNK and p38. PP2Cε was found to inhibit the TAK1-enhanced activation of either JNK or p38. These results indicated that a signaling component(s) situated between TAK1 and JNK/p38 could be a substrate of PP2Cε. We next determined whether MKK3b-induced activation of p38 is affected by PP2Cε in 293 cells. The expression of PP2Cα suppressed the MKK3b-enhanced phosphorylation of p38 in 293 cells (Fig.3A), confirming our previous observation performed using COS7 cells (17Hanada M. Kobayashi T. Ohnishi M. Ikeda S. Wang H. Katsura K. Yanagawa Y. Hiraga A. Kanamaru R. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 172-176Google Scholar). In contrast, PP2Cε expressed in the cells exhibited no effect on the phosphorylation level of p38 (Fig. 3B), indirectly suggesting no direct effect on MKK3 and thereby raising the possibility that TAK1, which lies upstream of MKK3, might be the substrate of PP2Cε. To determine whether TAK1 is a substrate of PP2Cε, we examined the dephosphorylation of TAK1 after incubation with PP2Cε in vitro (Fig. 4B). HA-TAK1 and its promoter HA-TAB1 were co-expressed in 293 cells, and HA-TAK1 was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts with anti-TAK1 antibody. When the immunoprecipitated TAK1 complex was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP, TAK1 became autophosphorylated. The immunoprecipitate containing the phosphorylated TAK1 was washed and next incubated with bacterially produced MBP-PP2Cε or GST-PP2Cॆ-1. TAK1 was dephosphorylated by PP2Cॆ-1 (Fig. 4A), confirming our previous observation (18Hanada M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Komaki K. Ohnishi M. Katsura K. Kanamaru R. Matsumoto K. Tamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5753-5759Google Scholar). Similarly, TAK-1 was dephosphorylated by MBP-PP2Cε in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4B). We next tested whether PP2Cε could dephosphorylate MKK4 or JNKin vitro (Fig. 4, C and D). Phosphorylated MKK4 or JNK was incubated with increasing concentrations of PP2Cε in vitro. PP2Cε did not dephosphorylate either MKK4 (Fig. 4C) or JNK (Fig. 4D) at the concentrations high enough to dephosphorylate TAK1. Based on these results, we propose that PP2Cε suppresses TAK1 signaling pathways by directly dephosphorylating TAK1 itself. To investigate the mechanism of PP2Cε action on TAK1 in more detail, we searched for a dominant negative form of PP2Cε in various point mutants of PP2Cε, defective in protein phosphatase activity. We prepared expression constructs for five different point mutants of PP2Cε, in which each of five different amino acids, known to be conserved in PP2C family members and to play essential roles in the enzyme activity, was replaced by another amino acid. We found that three of the resulting recombinant proteins exhibited essentially no activity against phosphorylated α-casein (Fig. 5A). In addition, one of these mutants, PP2Cε(D/A), in which Asp-245 had been replaced by Ala, was able to inhibit the dephosphorylation of TAK1 by PP2Cε in vitro (Fig. 5B). PP2Cε(D/A), expressed in 293 cells, reversed the inhibition of the TAK1-activated AP-1 reporter gene by the wild-type PP2Cε (Fig. 5C). Furthermore, expression of PP2Cε(D/A) in 293 cells enhanced further the TAK1-activated AP-1 reporter gene (Fig. 5D). These results support the ideas that PP2Cε(D/A) acts as a dominant negative form and that the endogenous PP2Cε may in fact participate in the negative regulation of the SAPK signaling pathways. Since TAK1 was found to be a substrate of PP2Cε, we next asked whether the phosphatase was able to associate with TAK1. To answer this question, we co-expressed HA-TAK1 and HA-PP2Cε or HA-PP2Cε(D/A) in 293 cells (Fig.6A). The cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-TAK1 antibody. Co-precipitated HA-PP2Cε was detected by immunoblotting using anti-HA antibody. The results demonstrated that both PP2Cε and PP2Cε(D/A) were co-immunoprecipitated with TAK1 (Fig. 6A). We considered the possibility that PP2Cε might associate preferentially with the phosphorylated TAK1, the substrate of PP2Cε. The TAK1(S/A) mutant, in which Ser-192 is replaced by Ala, is defective in both phosphorylation and activation (23Kishimoto K. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7359-7364Google Scholar). We co-expressed HA-PP2Cε and Myc-TAK1 or Myc-TAK1(S/A) in 293 cells and immunoprecipitated the Myc-TAK1 or Myc-TAK1(S/A) by anti-Myc antibody from the cell extracts. Immunoblot analysis using anti-HA antibody revealed that, simila"

To determine the role of endothelial-matrix interactions in barrier regulation, we induced cell shrinkage by exposing confluent endothelial monolayers to hyperosmolarity. The dominant effect of a 15-min hyperosmolar exposure was an increase in the trans-endothelial electrical resistance, indicating the induction of barrier strengthening. Hyperosmolar exposure also increased activity of focal adhesion kinase and E-cadherin accumulation at the cell periphery. Concomitantly, the density of actin filaments increased markedly. In EC monolayers stably expressing constitutively active or dominant negative isoforms of Rac1, the actin response to hyperosmolar exposure was enhanced or blocked, respectively, although the response in trans-endothelial resistance was unaffected, indicating that the endothelial barrier enhancement occurred independently of actin. However, in monolayers expressing a kinase-deficient mutant of focal adhesion kinase, the hyperosmolarity-induced increases in activity of focal adhesion and peripheral E-cadherin enhancement were blocked and the induced increase of electrical resistance was markedly blunted. These findings indicate that in EC exposed to hyperosmolar challenge, the involvement of focal adhesion kinase was critical in establishing barrier strengthening.

A decrease in barrier properties increases fluid flux and promotes tissue edema that in vital organs such as lung or brain could potentially be life threatening. Permeability of the EC barrier depends largely on the restriction to fluid transport across the paracellular pathway that contains tight junctions and adherens junctions (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar). Tight junctions are the primary determinants of barrier function (2Tsukita S. Furuse M. Itoh M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (2006) Google Scholar). Barrier-deteriorating agents cause EC contraction by activating Ca2+-dependent myosin light chain kinase, thereby widening the junctions and causing hyperpermeability of the EC barrier (3Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. J. Invest. Med. 1995; 43: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar). In a previous study, we reported that exposing lung capillaries to a 1-min hyperosmolar stimulus caused an immediate hyperpermeability response followed by a gradual return of barrier properties to normal (4Ragette R. Fu C. Bhattacharya J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that even while challenged by barrier-deteriorating stimuli, EC institute repair mechanisms that reestablish adequacy of the barrier. However, these repair processes remain inadequately understood. In this regard, the role of focal adhesions requires consideration. EC exposed to barrier deteriorating stimuli develop focal adhesion complexes at points of cell-matrix contact (5Bhattacharya S. Fu C. Bhattacharya J. Greenberg S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16781-16787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Although the barrier regulatory role of this response remains unclear, evidence from other cell types indicates that focal adhesion formation causes activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 6Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). It is proposed that in EC exposed to the barrier-deteriorating agent, thrombin, actin-induced translocation of FAK to focal adhesions reduces barrier deterioration (7Mehta D. Tiruppathi C. Sandoval R. Minshall R.D. Holinstat M. Malik A.B. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 779-789Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The actin cytoskeleton may be particularly relevant in this regard, because receptor-mediated enhancement of actin (8Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar) or actin stabilization by phallicidin (9Phillips P.G. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1994; 20: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) strengthens, whereas actin depolymerization by cytochalasins deteriorates the barrier (10Shasby D.M. Shasby S.S. Sullivan J.M. Peach M.J. Circ. Res. 1982; 51: 657-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). However, the specific mechanisms induced by FAK leading to barrier strengthening in EC remain unclear. Here we considered the possibility that FAK may be responsible for cross-talk between focal adhesions and cadherins. Dynamic regulation of the EC barrier is attributable to E-cadherin (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar, 11Rubin L.L. Hall D.E. Porter S. Barbu K. Cannon C. Horner H.C. Janatpour M. Liaw C.W. Manning K.

Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). At intercellular junctions, the cadherins form homophilic interactions between their extracellular domains on adjacent cell membranes, whereas their cytoplasmic domains bind β-catenin or plakoglobin (γ-catenin) that in turn associates with the actin-binding protein, α-catenin, thereby establishing a linkage between the cadherin-catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2917) Google Scholar,14Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Evidence that this linkage is important for barrier regulation comes from findings that barrier-deteriorating stimuli deplete both the cadherin-catenin complex (15Rabiet M.J. Plantier J.L. Rival Y. Genoux Y. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 488-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) as well as actin (16Ehringer W.D. Yamany S. Steier K. Farag A. Roisen F.J. Dozier A. Miller F.N. Microcirculation. 1999; 6: 291-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) from the cell periphery. The FAK substrate α-actinin also binds β-catenin (17Tsukatani Y. Suzuki K. Takahashi K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1997; 173: 54-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), thus providing a link between focal adhesions and the cadherin-catenin complex and thereby raising the possibility that focal adhesion assembly stabilizes the cadherin complex. We considered these issues in the context of hyperosmolar exposure that causes a cell shrinkage-induced activation of focal adhesion proteins as indicated by increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK (18Malek A.M. Goss G.G. Jiang L. Izumo S. Alper S.L. Stroke. 1998; 29: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This response provided an opportunity to test whether in EC FAK is involved in the stabilization of the cadherin complex and possibly of barrier properties. Accordingly, we generated EC expressing a truncated form of deleted FAK (del-FAK) in which cadherin expression in the plasma membrane was markedly diminished. Our findings indicate that although hyperosmolarity increased barrier properties and peripheral cadherin recruitment in wild type EC, both effects were markedly blunted in EC-expressing del-FAK, indicating that EC employ FAK-dependent signaling mechanisms as a means to barrier strengthening.

Cells were plated at a density of 1 × 105/cm2. EC phenotype was confirmed by cell uptake of fluorescent labeled-acetylated low density lipoprotein in imaged monolayers. For EC barrier quantification, we determined TER in RLMEC monolayers grown on sterile polycarbonate inserts held at 37 °C (Endohm, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). After a 30-min base-line period, experimental solutions were added and TER was determined every 15 s for the first 10 min and then at 1-min intervals for the subsequent 20 min. The data were corrected for the resistance of the insert alone. The plasmid pBS-FAK (a gift of Dr. James Parsons, Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Virginia, VA) was prepared by cloning the full-length FAK cDNA into the pBluescript, K5 vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (19Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A.

This plasmid was used for the generation of del-FAK DNA by deleting sequences among the EaeI sites at 1176 and 2793 bp (amino acids 392–931) in the FAK gene (Fig.1A). This deletion includes a segment containing tyrosine residues that are critical for FAK activation. These residues include Tyr-397 at which FAK autophosphorylates (20Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1442) Google Scholar). Del-FAK DNA (1.6 kb) was subcloned into the plasmid vector pBK-CMV (7.76 kb) atBamH1-XhoI sites and then introduced into the bacterial strain MV10. We selected the clone (kanamycin, 50 μg/ml) containing the 1.6-kb segment (pSLRCU33) corresponding to del-FAK variant (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) using restriction enzymes (BamH1-XhoI). Each 2 μg of plasmid pSLRCU33 or the empty vector was stably transfected in RLMEC using nominal procedures (Lipofectin, Invitrogen). To confirm transfection of the del-FAK construct in RLMEC, we prepared primers based on the full-length FAK cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number M86656) (19Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For PCR, the parameters were: denaturing at 95 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturing, annealing, and extension at 95, 59, and 72 °C for 1, 1, and 2 min, respectively, in 3 mmMgCl2. In the presence of these primers, amplification by RT-PCR is expected to yield a 600-bp product only in cells containing the del-FAK construct (Fig. 1B), confirming successful transfection of the del-FAK construct. In wild type and empty vector-transfected cells, the same primers yielded only the expected RT-PCR product of 2.2 kb (Fig. 1B). V12Rac1GFP and N17Rac1GFP constructs were generously provided by Dr. P.

Chimeras between enhanced GFP and GTPases were derived by insertion of the mutated GTPase open reading frames betweenEcoR1/SalI into the pEGFP-Cl expression vector downstream to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) coding sequence (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA).

Plasmid DNA, V12Rac1GFP, N17Rac1GFP, and vector pEGFP-Cl were amplified by the standard protocol and adjusted at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in water.

Subsequently, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mmNaF, 0.5% SDS, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1% SDS, and 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Total cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined using a protein analysis kit (BCA, Pierce). Cells were rinsed 2× PBS and solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 300 mm sucrose, 1.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The cells were scraped from the plate and centrifuged (10 min). The supernatant was collected. The cell pellet was suspended in 100 μl of SDS immunoprecipitation buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 1% SDS) and then boiled for 10 min and diluted to 300 μl with Triton X-100 buffer. Equal amounts of extracted proteins were immunoprecipitated and loaded for SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (4Ragette R. Fu C. Bhattacharya J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 685-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were precleared for 30 min with 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads followed by incubation with primary antibodies (4 μg for 2 h). Antibody-antigen complexes were precipitated with 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by washing the agarose beads three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and one time with PBS. Bound proteins were eluted in 40 μl of 4× Laemmli's loading buffer. The proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting. For the analysis of FAK autophosphorylation, we used the reported immune complex kinase assay (21Calalb M.B. Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 954-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We immunoprecipitated p125FAK from wild type or del-FAK-transfected RLMEC. The immunoprecipitated complexes were washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with kinase buffer (pH 7.4, 20 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2). The pellet was resuspended in 30 μl of the kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol), and the sample was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with frequent agitation. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 10 μl of 4× SDS-PAGE gel sample buffer followed by boiling for 5 min, and all of the products were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Direct exposures were used to visualize FAK autophosphorylation. The amount of FAK present in the reactions was visualized by immunoblotting of the same membrane with anti-FAK monoclonal antibody. Using glutathioneS-transferase-tagged p21- activated kinase-p21 binding domain (PAK-PBD) protein beads that specifically bind active Rac1, we obtained immunoprecipitates from EC lysates as per the methods reported previously (24Lewis A. Di Ciano C. Rotstein O.D. Kapus A. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C271-C279Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) using the assay kit from Cytoskeleton Inc. (Denver, CO). For positive and negative controls for the active and inactive small GTPases, the non-hydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPγS, and GDP were used, respectively. Cell lysates obtained from untreated cells were incubated with 100 μm GTPγS or 1 mm GDP in the presence of 10 mm EDTA for 15 min at 30 °C to ensure efficient loading with the added nucleotide. To terminate the reaction, the lysates were placed on ice and supplemented with 60 mm MgCl2. These control samples were then incubated with the glutathione S-transferase-tagged PAK-PBD protein beads and washed in the same manner as the other samples. Captured proteins were removed from the beads by boiling the samples in Laemmli buffer, and the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. RLMEC monolayers grown on glass coverslips were fixed (4% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, 20 min, 22 °C), rinsed (3× PBS), permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100), and stained using rhodamine-phalloidin. For immunofluorescence, cells were incubated with diluted primary antibodies (1:50) in blocking solution, 4% goat serum in PBS (1 h at 22 °C), and washed with 3× PBS. Fluorescence-conjugated antibodies then were added (1:500, 1 h at 22 °C) and washed with 3× PBS. The glass coverslips were mounted upside down on object slides using fluorescent-mounting medium (Dako Corporation Carpinteria, CA). Confocal images were obtained by means of a laser-scanning microscope (Pascal LSM, Carl Zeiss) and subjected to image analysis as described below (MCID 5, Imaging Research, St. Catherine, Canada). TER of RLMEC monolayers was stable at 37 ± 3 ohm/cm2 for up to 40 min (mean ± S.E.,n = 6). Exposure of monolayers to isosmolar medium (300 mosm) did not change TER from base line (Fig.2A). However, in monolayers exposed to medium-made hyperosmolar by the addition of sucrose (350 mosm), TER decreased in the first minute and then increased in the subsequent ∼10 min (Fig. 2A). The increase was sustained at a steady level for 5–7 min after which TER gradually returned to base line in 20–30 min. The increase of TER was abrogated by the addition of isosmolar medium (Fig. 2B), and it could be repeated subsequently in the same monolayer (data not shown). These findings indicated that subsequent to an initial decrease of barrier properties, the dominant effect of hyperosmolar exposure was to enhance the EC barrier. Because hyperosmolar exposure increases protein tyrosine phosphorylation in EC (18Malek A.M. Goss G.G. Jiang L. Izumo S. Alper S.L. Stroke. 1998; 29: 2631-2640Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and because actin polymerization is proposed to cause barrier strengthening (8Garcia J.G. Liu F. Verin A.D. Birukova A. Dechert M.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Bamberg J.R. English D. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 689-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar, 9Phillips P.G. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1994; 20: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), we exposed monolayers to inhibitors of tyrosine kinase and actin polymerization. The TER increase was inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, and by the inhibitors of actin polymerization, latrinculin B (Fig.2C) and cytochalasin D (data not shown). Although hyperosmolar exposure is reported to increase the cytosolic Ca2+ (25Paemeleire K. de Hemptinne A. Leybaert L. Exp. Brain Res. 1999; 126: 473-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM had no effect on the present TER response to hyperosmolarity (Fig. 2C). Not shown are results from experiments in which we incubated monolayers separately with the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase blocker SB203580 (25 μm), the protein kinase C blocker calphostin C (500 nm), or the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase blocker wortmannin (50 nm) (n = 3 for each inhibitor). A single monolayer was pretreated with the nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor l-NAME (30 μm). None of these treatments affected the TER response to hyperosmolarity. The maximum increase in TER correlated non-linearly with an osmolar concentration (Fig. 2D) with 80% of the response being established at 350 mosm. Hence, for the studies described below, we exposed EC to this hyperosmolar concentration for 15 min. Because genistein blocked the TER response to hyperosmolarity, we considered that hyperosmolar cell shrinkage might increase cell-matrix interactions, leading to activation of focal adhesion proteins. By confocal microscopy of wild type cells under base-line conditions, immunofluorescence of the focal adhesion marker protein paxillin was largely localized to the nuclear and perinuclear regions (Fig.3A, left image). Following hyperosmolar exposure, the fluorescence became pronounced as aggregates localized to the cell periphery in a pattern characteristic of focal adhesion formation (Fig. 3A, right image) (6Abedi H. Zachary I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). This focal adhesion response was absent in del-FAK-expressing monolayers (Fig. 3B). Exposure of plated EC to hyperosmolar sucrose also increased tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin (Fig. 3C). FAK activity, which was less in del-FAK-transfected monolayers than in wild type monolayers under base-line conditions (Fig. 3, D and E), increased 3-fold in wild type monolayers exposed to hyperosmolar medium (Fig. 3,D and E). By contrast, hyperosmolar exposure caused no enhancement of FAK activity in del-FAK-transfected cells (Fig. 3, D and E). Under non-stimulated conditions, TER was 30 ± 5% less in del-FAK-expressing monolayers than in wild type monolayers or in monolayers expressing vector alone (p < 0.05; n = 4). Following hyperosmolar exposure, the increase of TER was blunted in del-FAK-expressing monolayers to 60 ± 5% of that of wild type monolayers (Fig. 3F). Taking these findings together, we interpret that hyperosmolar exposure increased focal adhesion formation and that inhibition of this response inhibited the hyperosmolarity-induced barrier enhancement. To further consider the role of the cytosolic Ca2+, we carried out immunoprecipitations from monolayers treated with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM. Predictably, BAPTA-AM blocked the tyrosine phosphorylation of the Ca2+-dependent focal adhesion protein Pyk2 (Fig.4A) (26Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), but it did not modify phosphorylation responses for FAK or paxillin (data not shown). These results together with the above lack of an inhibitory effect on TER by BAPTA-AM indicate that the hyperosmolarity-induced TER increase was Ca2+-independent. In EC lysates, bands were evident at 125 and 68 kDa (Fig. 4, B and C), corresponding to FAK and paxillin, respectively (Fig. 3A). However, as opposed to the responses in plated EC, no increase of tyrosine phosphorylation was evident in lysates prepared either from suspended EC exposed to hyperosmolar sucrose (Fig. 4B,lanes 3 and 4) or from plated EC exposed to hyperosmolar urea (Fig. 4C, lane 3). The implications of these findings are discussed below. In considering the barrier regulatory function of FAK, we addressed the role of cadherins. Immunoprecipitation studies using mAbs against either VE- or E-cadherin indicated that although E-cadherin was well expressed in RLMEC (Fig.5A), the expression of VE-cadherin was weak (Fig. 5B), indicating that E-cadherin was the dominant cadherin type expressed in these EC. We confirmed that the mAb against VE-cadherin was capable of recognizing rat antigens (Fig. 5B) and that as reported by others (27Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) it recognized a band in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Fig.5B). Detergent-based fractionation of EC lysates into cytosolic and membrane fractions followed by quantitative immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting revealed that in wild type EC, E-cadherin content was greater in the membrane than the cytosolic fraction (Fig.5A, lanes 1 and 2). Hyperosmolar exposure increased the membrane content (Fig. 5A,lanes 2 and 4) while decreasing the cytosolic content (Fig. 5A, lanes 1 and 3). These compartmental changes were approximately equal as quantified by band densitometry (Fig. 5C). Accordingly, hyperosmolarity increased the membrane-cytosol ratio for E-cadherin (Fig.5C). In del-FAK-expressing cells, E-cadherin content was less under control conditions than in wild type cells (p < 0.01) (Fig. 5, A and C). Moreover, the membrane content was less than the cytosolic (Fig.5A, lanes 5 and 6, and C). Furthermore, in contrast to the wild type response, in del-FAK-expressing cells, E-cadherin failed to increase following hyperosmolar exposure (Fig. 5A, lanes 6 and 8), resulting in similar membrane-cytosol ratios under control and hyperosmolar conditions (Fig. 5C). Responses in monolayers expressing the empty vector were similar to those of wild type monolayers (Fig. 5A, lanes 9–12, and C). In wild type cells under base-line conditions, confocal microscopy revealed the distribution of E-cadherin as a discontinuous line of fluorescence that marked the cell periphery (Fig. 5D,left image). Following hyperosmolar exposure, this peripheral fluorescence became pronounced and was now evident as a continuous line (Fig. 5D, right image), indicating increased E-cadherin expression. In del-FAK-expressing monolayers, the peripheral fluorescence was poorly developed under both base-line and hyperosmolar conditions (Fig. 5E), indicating abrogation of E-cadherin expression and pointing to FAK as critical factor in the hyperosmolarity-induced enhancement of E-cadherin. Because latrinculin B inhibited the hyperosmolarity-induced TER increase (Fig. 2C), we considered the involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in the present barrier response. Confocal microscopy of untreated wild type cells revealed actin distribution as reflected in rhodamine-phalloidin fluorescence as a thin band at the cell periphery and a perinuclear condensation (Fig. 6A,left image). A 15-min hyperosmolar exposure markedly enhanced the density of filamentous actin in wild type cells but not in del-FAK-expressing cells (Fig. 6, A–C). Immunoblotting with an actin-recognizing mAb indicated that, as expected, actin content was higher in the membrane than in the cytosolic fraction under control conditions (Fig. 7, A and B). In wild type cells, hyperosmolar exposure increased membrane actin content almost 2-fold (Fig. 7B, comparesecond and fourth bars) w"

By using a rat ureteral obstruction model, we showed previously that L-selectin plays an important role in leukocyte infiltration into the kidney. Here we report the purification, identification, and characterization of an L-selectin-binding heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) expressed in the rat kidney. Partial amino acid sequencing and Western blotting analyses showed that the L-selectin-binding HSPG is collagen XVIII, a basement membrane HSPG. The binding of L-selectin to isolated collagen XVIII was specifically inhibited by an anti-L-selectin monoclonal antibody, EDTA, treatment of the collagen XVIII with heparitinase or heparin but not by chemically desulfated heparin. A cell binding assay showed that the L-selectin-collagen XVIII interaction mediates cell adhesion. Interestingly, collagen XVIII also interacted with a chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and presented it to a monocytic cell line, THP-1, which enhanced the α4β1 integrin-mediated binding of the THP-1 cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Thus, collagen XVIII may provide a link between selectin-mediated cell adhesion and chemokine-induced cellular activation and accelerate the progression of leukocyte infiltration in renal inflammation.

Weissman I.L. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1983; 304: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Subsequently, this molecule was found to be expressed on other types of leukocytes, such as neutrophils and monocytes, and to be involved in leukocyte migration into inflamed tissues (2Ley K.

In agreement with these reports, L-selectin-deficient mice show severely impaired lymphocyte homing and leukocyte infiltration to sites of inflammation (5Arbonés M.L. Ord D.C. Ley K. Ratech H.

L-selectin-binding molecules are found not only in the high endothelial venules of peripheral lymph nodes but also in non-vascular tissues, such as the white matter and choroid plexus of the central nervous system and the renal tubules (7Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that leukocyte infiltration into the kidney interstitium induced by ureteral obstruction was significantly reduced by the administration of an anti-rat L-selectin blocking mAb1 or a sulfated glycolipid, sulfatide, which binds to L-selectin in vitro(8Suzuki Y. Toda Y. Tamatani T. Watanabe T. Suzuki T. Nakao T. Murase K. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Tadano-Aritomi K. Ishizuka I. Miyasaka M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine L-selectin-reactive molecules that are expressed in the kidney. We first identified sulfatide, a sulfated glycolipid expressed in the renal distal tubules, as an L-selectin-binding molecule in the kidney (9Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J. Pathol. 1999; 188: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses revealed that, in addition to sulfatide, L-selectin-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are both expressed in the kidney (10Li Y.-F. Kawashima H. Watanabe N. Miyasaka M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Versican was identified as one of the L-selectin-binding chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (11Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol.

Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Miyasaka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) have remained undefined. In the present study, we isolated these L-selectin-binding HSPGs from the rat kidney and identified them as collagen XVIII, a basement membrane HSPG. We also found that collagen XVIII interacts with monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and induces the integrin activation of monocytes, raising the possibility that collagen XVIII plays a role in renal inflammation by bridging selectin- and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. A recombinant soluble form of rat L-selectin (LEC-IgG) has been described previously (7Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar).

(15Krisko I. DeBernardo E. Sato C.S. Kidney Int. 1977; 12: 238-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The fraction containing L-selectin-binding molecules (1 m NaCl fraction) was prepared as described previously (13Watanabe N. Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Miyasaka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The 1 m NaCl fraction was dialyzed against deionized water and lyophilized. The sample was then solubilized in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, 7 m urea, 0.1% octyl glucoside, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 1 mm PMSF, pH 7.4) and dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15m NaCl, pH 7.4). After dialysis, the buffer composition was adjusted to buffer B containing 0.046% Tween 20, 3 mmCaCl2, 0.93 mm PMSF, 4.6 μg/ml pepstatin, 4.0 μg/ml leupeptin. To 800 μl of this solution, 63.45 μl of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled with 5 milliunits of heparitinase (0.0788 milliunits/μl beads) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 h with agitation. After brief centrifugation to remove the beads, the supernatant was concentrated, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto a Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were visualized by staining with Ponceau S, and the 160- and 180-kDa bands were excised separately. In the next step, each membrane strip was blocked with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (Wako Pure Chemicals Co., Osaka, Japan), 0.1 m acetic acid, washed with buffer C (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0), and then incubated with 0.5 μg of trypsin (sequencing grade from bovine pancreas; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in buffer C at 37 °C for 15 h. After the reaction, peptides were fractionated on a reversed-phase C-18 column (3.9 × 150 mm; Millipore Co., Bedford, MA) at 1 ml/min under a 40-min gradient from 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid to 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid, 12% (v/v) acetonitrile, 28% (v/v) 2-propanol. The peak fractions detected by absorbance at 220 nm were collected and dried. The fractions (peaks 1 and 2 of the 160-kDa protein and peak 2 of the 180-kDa protein) were subjected to gas-phase microsequencing using a model 492 protein sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

A polyclonal antibody RES.16 was raised against the recombinant rat endostatin using conventional methods. Briefly, rat endostatin in complete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) was injected into a rabbit subcutaneously, followed by booster injections in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 2-week intervals. The polyclonal antiserum was affinity-purified on a CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) column coupled with the recombinant rat endostatin as described elsewhere (18Saarela J. Rehn M.

Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (13Watanabe N. Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Miyasaka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Ten milliliters of the 1 m NaCl fraction was mixed with 40 ml of buffer D (50 mm Tris-HCl, 8m urea, 1 mm PMSF, pH 8.0) and 2 ml of Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4 °C for 12 h. After incubation, the beads were packed in a column (Poly-Prep chromatography column; Bio-Rad) and washed with 10 ml of buffer D and then with 10 ml of buffer D containing 0.3 m NaCl. Collagen XVIII was eluted with 250 mm imidazole in buffer D, dialyzed against PBS, and stored at −80 °C until use. A portion of the purified collagen XVIII was biotinylated as described previously (12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). ELISA was performed as described previously (12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D.

Purified collagen XVIII was incubated overnight with a mixture of heparitinase (0.1 unit/ml), heparitinase I (0.1 unit/ml), and heparitinase II (0.1 unit/ml) in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, 0.14 m NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.8, at 37 °C. The disaccharide products were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide (2-AB) and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (19Kawashima H. Atarashi K. Hirose M. Hirose J.

Eluates were monitored using a fluorescence detector with excitation and emission wavelengths of 330 and 420 nm, respectively. Murine lymphoma EL-4 cells transfected with the BCMGSNeo vector containing rat L-selectin cDNA (RM-1) (20Watanabe T. Song Y. Hirayama Y. Tamatani T. Kuida K. Miyasaka M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or untransfected EL-4 cells were used for the L-selectin-mediated cell adhesion assay as described previously (12Kawashima H.

Chemokine-induced cell adhesion to VCAM-1 was determined as follows. Purified collagen XVIII (1 μg/ml) and/or VCAM-1 (0.5 μg/ml) were immobilized in the wells of 4-mm-diameter 96-well EIA/RIA plates (Corning Glass) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, the plates were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Various concentrations of MCP-1 were added to the wells, which were incubated for 2 h, and then washed with PBS containing 1 mmCaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. THP-1 cells (provided by Dr. Katsuhiko Ishihara, Osaka University Graduate school of Medicine) were labeled with 5 μm2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR), and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2% fetal calf serum (medium A). The cells were then added to the wells (5 × 104 cells/well) in triplicate. After a 10-min incubation at 37 °C, the wells were filled with medium A and sealed with parafilm. The plates were inverted for 20 min at 37 °C to allow non-adherent cells to detach from the bottom surface of the wells. The remaining bound cells were lysed, and the fluorescence intensity was measured as described previously (12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence staining of frozen sections of the rat kidney (male Wistar rat, 8-week-old) was performed as described previously (11Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Watanabe N. Hirose J. Hirose M. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). L-selectin binding HSPGs (13Watanabe N. Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Miyasaka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with core protein sizes of 160 and 180 kDa were purified by preparative SDS-PAGE, and their partial amino acid sequences were analyzed. The sequences of two fragments from the 160-kDa protein and one fragment from the 180-kDa protein were determined (Fig.1A). All the sequences obtained showed significant homology to that of human collagen XVIII (21Abe N. Muragaki Y. Yoshioka H. Inoue H. Ninomiya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 576-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Oh S.P. Kamagata Y. Muragaki Y. Timmons S. Ooshima A. Olsen B.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1994; 91: 4234-4238Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), suggesting that both the 160- and 180-kDa proteins are rat counterparts of human collagen XVIII. We next performed Western blotting analysis using a polyclonal antibody, RES.16, which had been raised against rat collagen XVIII. As shown in Fig. 1B, 160- and 180-kDa proteins that were precipitated with LEC-IgG were specifically reactive with RES.16. The binding of these proteins to LEC-IgG was apparently mediated by the C-type lectin domain of L-selectin, given that the binding was blocked by EDTA and the anti-rat L-selectin-blocking mAb HRL3 but not by the non-blocking anti-rat L-selectin mAb HRL2. Collectively, these results show that the L-selectin-binding HSPGs with core protein sizes of 160 and 180 kDa were both rat collagen XVIII. A GenBankTM data base search revealed that a partial sequence of rat collagen XVIII (GenBankTM accession number AF 189709) contains an unusual His11 segment. Because His repeating sequences have been widely used as an affinity tag for recombinant proteins to facilitate their binding to matrices containing immobilized Ni2+ ions, we next tried to purify rat collagen XVIII using nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose coupled with Ni2+ ions (Ni-NTA-agarose). The 1 m NaCl fraction from DEAE-Sepharose chromatography (13Watanabe N. Kawashima H. Li Y.-F. Miyasaka M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1999; 125: 826-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) containing collagen XVIII was applied to the Ni-NTA-agarose column, and the bound material was then eluted with 250 mm imidazole. As shown in Fig.2, whereas the 1 m NaCl fraction contained many proteins, the imidazole eluate contained almost exclusively proteins of 160 and 180 kDa. These bands were reactive with the RES.16 antibody in Western blotting analysis. 2H. Kawashima, unpublished observations. These results indicate that collagen XVIII was purified to an apparent homogeneity by Ni-NTA-agarose column chromatography. By having obtained purified collagen XVIII, we next examined if collagen XVIII could directly interact with L-selectin. As shown in Fig. 3A, biotinylated collagen XVIII bound to immobilized LEC-IgG but not to control human IgG, and the binding was inhibited by HRL3 or EDTA but not by HRL2. Treatment of the biotinylated collagen XVIII with heparitinase but not chondroitinase ABC or keratanase inhibited its binding to LEC-IgG (Fig.3B). These results indicate that heparan sulfate (HS) chains of collagen XVIII interact with the lectin domain of L-selectin. To examine the structural features of the HS chains required for the interaction of collagen XVIII with L-selectin, we next performed an inhibition assay using various chemically modified glycosaminoglycans. As shown in Fig. 4A, the binding of biotinylated collagen XVIII to LEC-IgG was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by intact heparin containing bothN- and O-sulfation. The blocking ability of intact heparin was comparable with that of chondroitin sulfate (CS) E, which strongly interacts with L-selectin (12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K.

On the other hand, the binding was not inhibited by chemically modified heparins, such as CDSNAc-heparin, CDSNS-heparin, and NDSNAc-heparin, indicating that both N- and O-sulfation of HS/heparin chains are required for the interaction of collagen XVIII with L-selectin. Consistently, disaccharide composition analysis showed that HS chains of collagen XVIII contained abundant N- and O-sulfated disaccharide units (Fig. 4B). Peak areas of ΔDiHS-0S, ΔDiHS-6S, ΔDiHS-NS, ΔDiHS-di(6,N)S, ΔDiHS-di(U,N)S, and ΔDiHS-tri(U,6,N)S in Fig. 4Bwere 8.1, 28.2, 19.9, 15.7, 20.4, and 7.7%, respectively. We (12Kawashima H. Hirose M.

Invest. 1998; 101: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) have shown previously that HS chains can interact with L- and P-selectin but not E-selectin or CD44. Consistent with this, biotinylated collagen XVIII bound L- and P-selectin-IgG but not E-selectin-IgG or CD44-IgG (Fig. 5). In contrast, biotinylated polymeric sialyl Lewis X (sLeX), a common ligand for selectins (27Foxall C. Watson S.R. Dowbenko D. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Asa D. Brandley B.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar), bound the three selectins. Biotinylated versican bound L- and P-selectin-IgG and CD44-IgG, whereas aggrecan (RC-PG) bound selectively to CD44-IgG, as described previously (12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D.

Matsuzawa Y. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To determine whether the L-selectin-collagen XVIII interaction could mediate cell adhesion, we next performed a cell-binding assay using L-selectin transfectants. As shown in Fig.6, rat L-selectin transfectants (RM-1 cells) bound to collagen XVIII-coated wells at a higher level than did untransfected EL-4 cells, and the binding was inhibited by HRL3 or EDTA but not by HRL2. These results indicate that the L-selectin-collagen XVIII interaction can mediate cell adhesion. We next examined the tissue distribution of L-selectin ligands and collagen XVIII in the kidney (Fig. 7). Consistent with our previous observations (7Tamatani T. Kuida K. Watanabe T. Koike S. Miyasaka M. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 1735-1745PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shikata K. Suzuki Y. Wada J. Hirata K. Matsuda M. Kawashima H. Suzuki T. Iizuka M. Makino H. Miyasaka M. J.

Immunol. 1999; 11: 393-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), LEC-IgG bound abundantly to tubules but only slightly, if at all, to the vascular bundles in the outer medulla of the rat kidney (Fig. 7A), whereas the anti-collagen XVIII antibody RES.16 reacted with the vascular bundles and the basement membranes of the tubules of the outer medulla (Fig.7B). Thus, L-selectin ligands and collagen XVIII appeared to colocalize in the basement membranes of the renal tubules of the outer medulla. In contrast, collagen XVIII was also detected in the glomeruli and tubules in the renal cortex, where no LEC-IgG binding was observed (Fig. 7, C and D), suggesting that the collagen XVIII expressed in these regions is not reactive with L-selectin. HSPGs are proposed to function as “reservoirs” for chemokines and to present them to leukocytes efficiently (29Tanaka Y. Adams D.H. Shaw S. Immunol. Today. 1993; 14: 111-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Among various chemokines, MCP-1 has been shown to play a critical role in renal inflammation (30Schlöndorff D. Nelson P.J. Luckow B. Banas B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 610-621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 31Lloyd C.M. Minto A.W. Dorf M.E. Proudfoot A. Wells T.N.C. Salant D.J.

Invest. 1999; 103: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). We thus examined the possibility that collagen XVIII interacts not only with L-selectin but also with MCP-1 and presents it to leukocytes. As shown in Fig.8A, MCP-1 bound to immobilized collagen XVIII in a dose-dependent manner. The binding was inhibited by heparitinase but not by chondroitinase ABC treatment, indicating that MCP-1 interacts with HS chains of collagen XVIII. Binding of MCP-1 to immobilized collagen XVIII was inhibited by LEC-IgG in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 8B). Similarly, binding of LEC-IgG to immobilized collagen XVIII was inhibited by MCP-1 (Fig. 8C), suggesting that MCP-1 and L-selectin interact with the same or overlapping carbohydrate structure in the HS chains of collagen XVIII. We then investigated the possible functional consequences of the collagen XVIII-MCP-1 interaction. To this end, MCP-1 was applied to wells that had been coated with collagen XVIII alone or with a mixture of collagen XVIII and VCAM-1. We then applied to each well a monocytic cell line, THP-1, that expresses a receptor for MCP-1, CCR2B, and α4β1 integrin. The THP-1 cells did not bind collagen XVIII in an L-selectin-dependent manner under the conditions used in this experiment, and thus were useful to determine the effect of chemokine presentation by collagen XVIII on integrin-mediated cell adhesion. As shown in Fig.9A, THP-1 cells bound to the wells that had been coated with a mixture of collagen XVIII and VCAM-1 but not to the wells coated with collagen XVIII or VCAM-1 alone in a manner dependent on the dose of MCP-1, indicating that MCP-1 that had been immobilized on collagen XVIII activated the binding of THP-1 cells to VCAM-1. This up-regulated adhesion was apparently mediated by α4β1 integrin, since the adhesion was blocked by either the anti-α4 integrin mAb HP2/1 or the anti-β1 integrin mAb 4B4 (Fig. 9B). In this study, we have purified L-selectin-binding HSPGs in the kidney and identified them as collagen XVIII. Treatment with heparitinase, but not with any other GAG-degrading enzymes, abolished the L-selectin binding (Fig. 3B), indicating that HS chains of collagen XVIII bind to L-selectin. Unlike sulfatide, collagen XVIII bound to L-selectin in a divalent cation-dependent manner. This binding was inhibited by the mAb HRL3, which inhibits the binding of L-selectin to lymph node high endothelial venules (14Tamatani T. Kitamura F. Kuida K. Shirao M. Mochizuki M. Suematsu M. Schmid-Schönbein G.W. Watanabe K. Tsurufuji S. Miyasaka M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These results indicate that HS chains on collagen XVIII are recognized by the lectin domain of L-selectin, which is known to interact with sLeX-like sugar chains on L-selectin ligands such as CD34 and glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule-1 (GlyCAM-1) (33Hemmerich S.

Collagen XVIII is a triple helical endothelial/epithelial basement membrane protein characterized by multiple interrupted triple helical regions and a unique C-terminal endostatin domain (21Abe N.

Collagen XVIII became the focus of medical interest when an 18-kDa anti-angiogenic peptide with tumor-suppressing activity, named endostatin, turned out to be the C-terminal part of collagen XVIII (16O'Reilly M.S.

More recently, it was reported that collagen XVIII is modified with HS chains in the human kidney (18Saarela J. Rehn M. Oikarinen A. Autio-Harmainen H. Pihlajaniemi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 611-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and in various organs in the chick (35Halfter W. Dong S. Schurer B. Cole G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25404-25412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our present finding that the binding of rat collagen XVIII to L-selectin and MCP-1 is mediated by HS chains of collagen XVIII is consistent with these previous reports. Amino acid sequencing and Western blotting analyses showed that the 160- and 180-kDa proteins are both rat collagen XVIII (Fig.1). To date, three variants of mouse collagen XVIII (36Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4705-4711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 37Rehn M. Hintikka E. Pihlajaniemi T. Genomics. 1996; 15: 436-446Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and two variants of human collagen XVIII (38Saarela J. Ylikarppa R. Rehn M. Purmonen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) have been reported. In the mouse and human, collagen XVIII transcripts corresponding to the short variant are predominantly expressed in the kidney (36Rehn M. Pihlajaniemi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4705-4711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Saarela J. Ylikarppa R. Rehn M. Purmonen S. Pihlajaniemi T. Matrix Biol. 1998; 16: 319-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The human collagen XVIII short variant is 180 kDa after heparin lyase II and III treatment (18Saarela J. Rehn M. Oikarinen A. Autio-Harmainen H. Pihlajaniemi T. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 611-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). It is unclear at present whether the 160- and 180-kDa proteins detected in the rat kidney represent forms produced by alternative splicing or proteolytic cleavage. However, the presence of two forms does not appear to be due to the cleaving off of the C-terminal 18-kDa endostatin domain from the core protein, because both proteins were reactive with the RES.16 antibody, which recognizes the rat endostatin domain. It appears that proteoglycans can selectively interact with particular adhesion molecules depending on differences in their GAG modifications. As reported previously, versican modified with CS B and CS C (12Kawashima H. Hirose M. Hirose J. Nagakubo D. Plaas A.H.K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35448-35456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) as well as CS E (19Kawashima H. Atarashi K. Hirose M. Hirose J. Yamada S. Sugahara K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12921-12930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) binds L- and P-selectin and CD44, whereas the rat chondrosarcoma proteoglycan aggrecan, which is modified exclusively with CS A (28Fujimoto T. Kawashima H. Tanaka T. Hirose M. Toyama-Sorimachi N. Matsuzawa Y. Miyasaka M. Int. Immunol. 2001; 13: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), selectively binds CD44 (Fig. 5). Collagen XVIII modified with highly sulfated HS (Fig. 4B) bound both L- and P-selectin but not CD44 (Fig. 5). It should be noted, however, that only a subset of collagen XVIII, such as that expressed in the basement membrane of distal tubules, bound L-selectin, whereas collagen XVIII in other locations did not (Fig. 7). This result implies that only a subset of collagen XVIII species present in the rat kidney is modified with L-selectin-reactive HS chains. Although the precise carbohydrate structure required for L-selectin binding has yet to be determined, our present results suggest that both N- and O-sulfation of heparin/HS chains are required for the interaction with L-selectin (Fig. 4A). Although only a weak expression of MCP-1 in tubular epithelial cells has been reported in the normal kidney (39Prodjosudjadi W. Gerritsma J.S. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. Bruijn J.A. Clin. Nephrol. 1995; 44: 148-155PubMed Google Scholar), a strong expression of MCP-1 has been detected in various renal diseases. For example, strong tubular epithelial expression of MCP-1 was found in kidney biopsies of patients with membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, and glomerulosclerosis (39Prodjosudjadi W. Gerritsma J.S. van Es L.A. Daha M.R. Bruijn J.A. Clin. Nephrol. 1995; 44: 148-155PubMed Google Scholar). MCP-1 expression was also found in the glomeruli from biopsies of patients with proliferative glomerulonephritis, Wegener's disease, and lupus nephritis (40Rovin B.H. Rumancik M. Tan L. Dickerson J. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 536-542PubMed Google Scholar). Our finding that collagen XVIII interacts with MCP-1 and presents it to a monocytic cell line to induce α4β1 integrin activation in vitro (Figs. 8 and 9) indicates that collagen XVIII may bind locally produced MCP-1 and present it to infiltrating monocytes in the diseased kidney. Under physiological conditions, L-selectin-reactive molecules are selectively localized to the epithelial cells of distal tubules, where leukocytes do not normally traffic. The paucity of leukocytes in the kidney parenchyma under physiological conditions can probably be explained by the absence of leukocyte accessibility to collagen XVIII and other L-selectin-binding molecules in the kidney. However, in the diseased kidney, where massive mononuclear cell infiltration can be observed, it is possible that collagen XVIII interacts with L-selectin on the infiltrating cells and/or presents chemokines to them, and may accelerate the progression of inflammatory processes. Experimental verification is now required to assess the actual involvement of collagen XVIII in leukocyte migration under pathological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2107678524,"Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the terminal step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways. In HepG2 cells, the maximum repression of basal glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase) gene transcription by insulin requires two distinct promoter regions, designated A (located between −231 and −199) and B (located between −198 and −159), that together form an insulin response unit. Region A binds hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, which acts as an accessory factor to enhance the effect of insulin, mediated through region B, on G6Pase gene transcription. We have previously shown that region B binds the transcriptional activator FKHR (FOXO1a) in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that FKHR also binds the G6Pase promoter in situ and that insulin inhibits this binding. Region B contains three insulin response sequences (IRSs), designated IRS 1, 2, and 3, that share the core sequence T(G/A)TTTT. However, detailed analyses reveal that these three G6Pase IRSs are functionally distinct. Thus, FKHR binds IRS 1 with high affinity and IRS 2 with low affinity but it does not bind IRS 3. Moreover, in the context of the G6Pase promoter, IRS 1 and 2, but not IRS 3, are required for the insulin response. Surprisingly, IRS 3, as well as IRS 1 and IRS 2, can each confer an inhibitory effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene, indicating that, in this context, a transcription factor other than FKHR, or its orthologs, can also mediate an insulin response through the T(G/A)TTTT motif. Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the terminal step in the gluconeogenic and glycogenolytic pathways. In HepG2 cells, the maximum repression of basal glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase) gene transcription by insulin requires two distinct promoter regions, designated A (located between −231 and −199) and B (located between −198 and −159), that together form an insulin response unit. Region A binds hepatocyte nuclear factor-1, which acts as an accessory factor to enhance the effect of insulin, mediated through region B, on G6Pase gene transcription. We have previously shown that region B binds the transcriptional activator FKHR (FOXO1a) in vitro. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that FKHR also binds the G6Pase promoter in situ and that insulin inhibits this binding. Region B contains three insulin response sequences (IRSs), designated IRS 1, 2, and 3, that share the core sequence T(G/A)TTTT. However, detailed analyses reveal that these three G6Pase IRSs are functionally distinct. Thus, FKHR binds IRS 1 with high affinity and IRS 2 with low affinity but it does not bind IRS 3. Moreover, in the context of the G6Pase promoter, IRS 1 and 2, but not IRS 3, are required for the insulin response. Surprisingly, IRS 3, as well as IRS 1 and IRS 2, can each confer an inhibitory effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene, indicating that, in this context, a transcription factor other than FKHR, or its orthologs, can also mediate an insulin response through the T(G/A)TTTT motif. glucose 6-phosphate glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit hepatocyte nuclear factor insulin response sequence chromatin immunoprecipitation endoplasmic reticulum phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 insulin response factor chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase glutathioneS-transferase hepatic glucose production isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside wild-type triple mutant protein kinase B site-directed mutation Glucose-6-phosphatase catalyzes the final step in the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways, the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate (G6P)1 to glucose and inorganic phosphate (1Mithieux G.

Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 132-139Google Scholar), pancreatic islets (6Arden S.D. Zahn T. Steegers S. Webb S. Bergman B. O'Brien R.M. Hutton J.C. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 531-542Google Scholar), and brain (7Khan A. Zong-Chao L. Efendic S. Landau B.R. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 627-629Google Scholar). The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and is thought to exist as a multicomponent system consisting of a catalytic subunit in addition to specific transporters for G6P, glucose, and inorganic phosphate (1Mithieux G. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 137-145Google Scholar, 2Foster J.D. Pederson B.A. Nordlie R.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1997; 215: 314-332Google Scholar, 3van de Werve G. Lange A. Newgard C.

To date the glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6Pase) (8Lei K.J. Shelly L.L. Pan C.J. Sidbury J.B. Chou J.Y. Science. 1993; 262: 580-583Google Scholar) and the G6P transporter (9Gerin I. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Achouri Y. Collet J.F. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 235-238Google Scholar) are the only components of the system that have been identified. Recently, several novel genes encoding putative glucose transporters have been identified, but whether any of these transporters are localized to the ER is currently unknown (10Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Google Scholar). A promising candidate appears to be GLUT9, which, like G6Pase, is predominantly expressed in liver and kidney (11Phay J.E. Hussain H.B. Moley J.F. Genomics. 2000; 66: 217-220Google Scholar). Moreover, although GLUT9 does not contain a carboxyl-terminal di-lysine ER retention motif, it does contain a weak amino-terminal di-arginine ER retention motif (12Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Google Scholar). In vivo studies in liver and in situ studies in liver-derived cell lines or in primary hepatocytes have shown that G6Pase gene expression is stimulated by glucose, glucocorticoids, cAMP, fatty acids, leptin, and ॆ3-adrenergic receptor agonists, whereas expression is inhibited by tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-6, and insulin (see Ref. 13Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12108-12118Google Scholar for individual citations). Insulin inhibits basal as well as glucose-, glucocorticoid-, cAMP-, and fatty acid-stimulated G6Pase gene expression. In HepG2 cells, the effect of insulin on basal mouse and human G6Pase gene transcription is mediated through a multi-component insulin response unit, which consists of two regions, designated regions A and B (14Streeper R.S.

Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1885-1889Google Scholar). In the mouse G6Pase promoter, region A is located between −231 and −199, whereas region B is located between −198 and −158. Region B contains an insulin response sequence (IRS), because it can confer an inhibitory effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene (14Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11698-11701Google Scholar,15Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Google Scholar). In contrast, region A acts as an accessory element to enhance the effect of insulin on G6Pase expression mediated through region B. The accessory factor that binds region A has been identified as hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 (HNF-1) (15Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Google Scholar). Multiple distinct IRSs have been identified through which insulin can stimulate gene transcription, but only two inhibitory IRSs have been well characterized (17O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Google Scholar). One of these inhibitory IRSs was identified through studies on the glucagon promoter (18Philippe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7224-7227Google Scholar, 19Grzeskowiak R. Amin J. Oetjen E. Knepel W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30037-30045Google Scholar), whereas the other was first identified through studies on the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter (20Forest C.D. O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1302-1310Google Scholar, 21O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Google Scholar). This PEPCK IRS has the sequence TGTTTTG (21O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Forest C.D. Magnuson M.A. Granner D.K. Science. 1990; 249: 533-537Google Scholar, 22O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C. Powell D.R. Granner D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1747-1758Google Scholar); similar elements were subsequently identified that mediate inhibitory effects of insulin on transcription of the genes encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) (23Suwanickul A. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Google Scholar), tyrosine aminotransferase (24Ganss R. Weih F. Schutz G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 895-903Google Scholar), and G6Pase (14Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11698-11701Google Scholar). The IGFBP-1 promoter has two of these motifs arranged as an inverted palindrome (23Suwanickul A. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17063-17068Google Scholar), whereas inspection of the region B sequence in the G6Pase promoter reveals that it has three of these motifs arranged in tandem (14Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11698-11701Google Scholar). A comparison of the sequences of the IRS motifs from these genes suggests that the consensus sequence of this element is T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(G/T), which we refer to as the PEPCK-like IRS (25O'Brien R.M. Streeper R.S. Ayala J.E. Stadelmaier B.T. Hornbuckle L.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 552-558Google Scholar). The identity of the insulin response factor (IRF) that binds this motif and mediates the action of insulin has been elusive. Candidates have included C/EBP (26O'Brien R.M. Lucas P.C. Yamasaki T.

However, detailed mutagenesis studies revealed that the effect of insulin on gene transcription mediated through this element does not correlate with the binding of any of these factors. More recently, substantial attention has focused on the potential role of the winged helix/forkhead transcription factor FKHR (FOXO1a) and its orthologs, FKHRL1 (FOXO3a) and AFX (FOXO4a), as the elusive IRF. FKHR and its orthologs emerged as candidates for the IRF indirectly from genetic experiments in Caenorhabditis elegans that identified a homologous transcription factor, Daf-16, as the target of an insulin-like metabolic signaling pathway (30Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Google Scholar, 31Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that FKHR can bind the PEPCK, IGFBP-1, and G6Pase IRSsin vitro (16Ayala J.E. Streeper R.S. Desgrosellier J.S. Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Barr F.G.

Burchell A. Guo S. Walther R. Unterman T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36324-36333Google Scholar). In addition, FKHR was shown to stimulate PEPCK, IGFBP-1, and G6Pase fusion gene expression (32Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Scheimann A.O. Yee D. Jackson J.G. Barr F.G. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3140-3146Google Scholar, 34Schmoll D. Walker K.S. Alessi D.R. Grempler R. Burchell A. Guo S. Walther R. Unterman T.G. J. Biol.

It has been proposed that insulin inhibits FKHR-, FKHRL1-, and AFX-mediated transcriptional activation through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent activation of PKB, which leads to the phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of these factors (33Tang E.D.

Although these studies support the hypothesis that FKHR and its orthologs are the insulin response factors that bind the PEPCK-like IRS motif and mediate the inhibitory effect of insulin on gene transcription through this element, other results are not consistent with this model. Thus, there are several studies that suggest PKB either is not required or is not sufficient for insulin-regulated PEPCK and G6Pase gene expression (43Dickens M. Svitek C.A. Culbert A.A. O'Brien R.M. Tavare J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20144-20149Google Scholar, 44Agati J.M. Yeagley D. Quinn P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18751-18759Google Scholar, 45Kotani K. Ogawa W. Hino Y. Kitamura T. Ueno H. Sano W. Sutherland C. Granner D.K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21305-21312Google Scholar). In addition, a detailed base-by-base analysis of the PEPCK IRS indicated that the effect of insulin mediated through this element on heterologous gene transcription does not correlate with FKHRL1 binding (46Hall R.K. Yamasaki T. Kucera T. O'Brien R, M. Granner D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30169-30175Google Scholar). Because many of the reported studies on FKHR, FKHRL1, and AFX have involved overexpression of wild-type or mutated forms of these proteins, one concern is that these factors are simply displacing the endogenous IRF. Therefore, the experiments described in this report were specifically designed to assess what role, if any, endogenous transcriptional activators, such as FKHR, play in the repression of basal G6Pase gene transcription by insulin. Our results, derived from fusion gene analyses, are consistent with a model in which insulin inhibits basal G6Pase gene transcription by inhibiting the function of a transcriptional activator, such as FKHR. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrate that FKHR does bind the G6Pase promoter in situ and that insulin inhibits this binding. However, our experiments also revealed that the three G6Pase IRSs are functionally distinct. Thus, detailed gel retardation analyses show that FKHR binds IRS 1 with high affinity and IRS 2 with low affinity but that it does not bind IRS 3. Moreover, mutational analyses demonstrate that, in the context of the G6Pase promoter, only IRS 1 and 2, but not IRS 3, are required for the insulin response. Surprisingly, IRS 1 and IRS 2 are equally important for the insulin response despite their very different affinities for FKHR. Moreover, IRS 3, as well as IRS 1 and IRS 2, can confer an inhibitory effect of insulin on the expression of a heterologous fusion gene. These observations suggest that a transcription factor other than FKHR, or its orthologs, can also mediate an insulin response through the T(G/A)TTTT motif. [α-32P]dATP (>3000 Ci mmol−1) was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Specific antisera to FKHR (sc-11350) and rabbit IgG (sc-2027) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The generation of mouse G6Pase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) fusion genes, containing promoter sequences located between −231 and +66, −198 and +66, and −158 and +66, relative to the transcription start site, has been described (14Streeper R.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar) to introduce single point mutations into all three of the region B IRS motifs (15Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A. O'Brien R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9208-9213Google Scholar). The resulting construct, designated −751 region B SDM (15Streeper R.S. Eaton E.M. Ebert D.H. Chapman S.C. Svitek C.A.

A truncated version of this construct, designated −231 TM, was generated within the context of the −231 to +66 G6Pase promoter fragment using PCR. The same three-step PCR strategy (47Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Google Scholar) was used to introduce various point mutations into the individual region B IRS motifs all within the context of the −231 to +66 G6Pase promoter fragment. The constructs generated contained either mutations in the individual IRS motifs (designated −231 IRS 1 SDM, −231 IRS 2 SDM, and −231 IRS 3 SDM), mutations in two of the three IRS motifs (designated −231 IRS 1 + 2 SDM), mutations that switched the sequence of IRS 3 to that of IRS 1 (designated −231 IRS 1:2:1), or mutations that switched the sequence of both IRS 1 and IRS 2 to that of IRS 3 (designated −231 IRS 3:3:3). All promoter fragments generated by PCR were completely sequenced, using the U. S. Biochemical Corp. Sequenase kit, to verify the absence of polymerase errors. The plasmid TKC-VI contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter ligated to the CAT reporter gene (22O'Brien R.M. Noisin E.L. Suwanichkul A. Yamasaki T. Lucas P.C. Wang J.C.

The TK promoter sequence extends from −480 to +51 and contains aBamHI site located between positions −40 and −35. Various double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the G6Pase promoter sequence between −197 and −159 or G6Pase IRS 1 (GATCACCTGTTTTT) or G6Pase IRS 3 (GATCACCTATTTTA) were synthesized withBamHI-compatible ends and cloned, as a single copy in same orientation as found in the G6Pase gene, or as multiple copies, intoBamHI-cleaved TKC-VI by standard techniques (14Streeper R.S.

The CAT reporter gene was then replaced with the more sensitive firefly luciferase reporter by re-isolating the various TKC-VI promoter constructs, as BamHI-XhoI fragments, from the plasmids described above and ligating them into the pGL3-Mod vector. This vector is based on the pGL3 Basic firefly luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI) but contains a modified polylinker (50Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M.

The generation of human IGFBP-1-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase fusion genes, containing promoter sequences located between −1205 and +68, −132 and +68, and −103 and +68, relative to the transcription start site, has been described (51Suwanichkul A. Cubbage M.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol.

Allander S.V. Morris S.L. Powell D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30835-30841Google Scholar). The construction of a human pcDNA3-FKHR expression vector has also been previously described (32Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Scheimann A.O. Yee D. Jackson J.G. Barr F.G. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3140-3146Google Scholar). All plasmid constructs were purified by centrifugation through cesium chloride gradients (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Rat H4IIE hepatoma cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.57 (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2.57 (v/v) newborn calf serum. Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown in the same media supplemented with 57 (v/v) Nu serum IV (Becton Dickinson). H4IIE and HepG2 cells were transiently transfected in suspension with the plasmids indicated in the figure legends using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as previously described (22O'Brien R.M.

In experiments using HepG2 cells, an expression vector encoding the insulin receptor, courtesy of Dr. Jonathan Whittaker, was co-transfected with the reporter gene construct. CAT and ॆ-galactosidase assays were performed exactly as previously described (14Streeper R.S. Svitek C.A. Chapman S. Greenbaum L.E. Taub R. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol.

For comparisons of basal gene expression, basal CAT activity directed by the various fusion gene constructs was corrected for the ॆ-galactosidase activity in the same samples. Because insulin stimulates Rous sarcoma virus-ॆ-galactosidase expression in HepG2 cells and SV40-Renilla luciferase expression in H4IIE cells (data not shown), for comparisons of the effect of insulin on fusion gene expression, CAT or firefly luciferase activity from control and insulin-treated cells was corrected for the protein concentration in the cell lysate, as measured by the Pierce BCA assay. Each construct was analyzed in duplicate or in quadruplicate in multiple transfections, as specified in the figure legends, using several independent plasmid preparations. A plasmid encoding a glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-FKHR fusion protein (32Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Scheimann A.O. Yee D. Jackson J.G. Barr F.G. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3140-3146Google Scholar) was transformed into Escherichia coli (XL1-Blue). This plasmid was derived from the pGEX-5X-3 vector (Amersham Biosciences) such that fusion gene expression can be induced by isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) (32Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Scheimann A.O. Yee D. Jackson J.G. Barr F.G. Powell D.R. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3140-3146Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown to an A600 of ∼0.7 in LB supplemented with 200 ॖg/ml ampicillin, and GST-FKHR expression was induced by incubation with 1 mm IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation; resuspended in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and lysed by sonication. Complementary oligonucleotides representing the wild type G6Pase region B sequence between −196 and −155 (Table I) were synthesized withBamHI-compatible ends, gel-purified, annealed, and then labeled with [α-32P]dATP by using the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I to a specific activity of ∼2.5 ॖCi/pmol (49Sambrook J.

Labeled oligonucleotide (∼7 fmol) was incubated with bacterial lysate (∼12 ॖg) in a reaction volume of 20 ॖl containing, at final concentrations, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 57 glycerol (v/v), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 ng of poly(dG-dC)·poly(dG-dC). For competition experiments, unlabeled competitor DNA was mixed with the labeled oligomer at the indicated molar excess prior to the addition of bacterial extract. After incubation for 10 min on ice, the reactants were loaded onto a 67 polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed at 4 °C for 120 min at 190 V in 0.5× TBE (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F.

Following electrophoresis the gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR5 film, and binding was analyzed by autoradiography.

SERCA1a and SERCA1b, the developmentally regulated isoforms of the ATP2A1 gene, arise through alternative splicing at the 3′-end of theATP2A1 transcript (6Brandl C.J. deLeon S. Martin D.R. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3768-3774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SERCA1a accounts for more than 99% of SERCA isoforms expressed in adult rat fast twitch skeletal muscle, whereas SERCA1b is predominant in neonatal muscle (7Wu K.D. Lytton J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C333-C341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SERCA2a is the major isoform in heart and slow twitch skeletal muscle, whereas SERCA2b and SERCA3 are more ubiquitously expressed. Brody disease is a rare inherited disorder of skeletal muscle, resulting in exercise-induced impairment of skeletal muscle relaxation, stiffness, and cramps (8Brody I.A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1969; 281: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+uptake and Ca2+-ATPase activities in muscle samples obtained from Brody's patients are reduced to levels ranging from 0 to 50% compared with activities measured in normal controls (9Karpati G.

Sequencing of ATP2A1 DNA from Brody disease patients has revealed a number of frameshift mutations that truncate SERCA1 (14Odermatt A. Taschner P.E. Khanna V.K. Busch H.F. Karpati G. Jablecki C.K.

All of these mutations lead to loss of SERCA1a function. However, mutations inATP2A1 account for only about half of Brody disease cases, and the genetic basis for the other Brody syndrome patients remains to be discovered (17Karpati G. MacLennan D.H. Serratrice G. Pouget J. Azulay J.-P. Exercise Intolerance and Muscle Contracture. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1999: 45-54Crossref Google Scholar). Recent advances in transgenic mouse technology have made it possible to address the physiological relevance of increases or decreases in SERCA expression. Overexpression of SERCA2 in the myocardium resulted in enhanced myocardial function (18He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.J. Rockman H.A. McDonough P.M. Bluhm W.F. Meyer M. Sayen M.R.

By contrast, the ablation ofATP2A2 was lethal, and heterozygous SERCA2+/−mice manifested impaired cardiac contractility and delayed cardiomyocyte relaxation (21Periasamy M. Reed T.D. Liu L.H. Ji Y. Loukianov E. Paul R.J. Nieman M.L. Riddle T. Duffy J.J. Doetschman T. Lorenz J.N. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2556-2562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Ablation of the ATP2A3 gene encoding SERCA3 was not lethal, but defects were noted in endothelium-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cell Ca2+ signaling in SERCA3-null mice (22Liu L.H.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate both the role of SERCA1 in physiological functions and the mechanisms by which SERCA1 mutations could cause Brody disease. Since the ATP2A1 gene is expressed almost exclusively in fast-twitch fibers, it was of particular interest to investigate the effects of its disruption on the function of muscles such as the diaphragm, where fast twitch fibers make up a large fraction of the total fibers. SERCA1−/− mice were born with normal body weight and normal gross morphology. However, affected mice developed cyanosis and gasping respiration and died shortly after birth. Histopathological analysis of mice at term revealed congestion and hypercellularity of the lung, consistent with failure of the respiratory musculature to produce sufficient chest expansion to open the lung alveoli after birth. Analysis of the diaphragm muscle revealed increased fiber size variability and prominent hypercontracted regions in scattered muscle fibers. The demonstrable loss of SERCA1 protein from diaphragm and skeletal muscles was accompanied by a dramatic reduction in Ca2+ uptake activity in homogenates from these tissues. No compensatory responses were detected in mRNA or protein levels for other Ca2+ regulatory proteins. A significant impairment of the contractile response of isolated diaphragm muscles to electrical stimulation was also measured. These results demonstrate that the loss of SERCA1 in the diaphragm of mice leads to neonatal death from respiratory failure. A λ phage clone containing part of the mouse ATP2A1 gene was isolated from a strain 129/SvJ genomic library (a gift of Dr. J. Rossant, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Canada) and partially characterized by Southern blot analysis, restriction mapping, and DNA sequence analysis. The cloned 15-kb fragment contained the 3′-end of the promoter and the sequence corresponding to exons 1–9 of the human ATP2A1 gene, which encode amino acids 1–365. In over 154 codons sequenced, no amino acid substitutions were observed in the mouse sequence relative to that of human SERCA1, thereby confirming the identity of the gene (23Zhang Y. Fujii J. Phillips M.S. Chen H.S. Karpati G. Yee W.C. Schrank B. Cornblath D.R. Boylan K.B. MacLennan D.H. Genomics. 1995; 30: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). This conclusion was strengthened when a partial sequence of the corresponding region was retrieved from the murine genome via the Ensembl Genome Browser (available on the World Wide Web at www.ensembl.org). Strikingly, the similarity between the human and mouse ATP2A1 gene regions extended beyond the conserved sequences within the exons; the overall size of the introns was very similar in the two species. The targeting construct was prepared with the pBluescript II SK− vector as a backbone. The PGK-Neo and PGK-TK cassettes in plasmids pGEM7(KJ1)SalI-R and pGEM7(TK)SalI, respectively, were used in construction. The targeting vector was constructed by replacing ∼4.2 kb of genomic sequence with the PGK-Neo expression cassette (see Fig. 1A). The cassette was inserted between a 5.2-kb EcoRI-AvrII gene fragment located 1.8 kb upstream of exon 1 and a 0.9-kbBamHI-HindIII fragment containing exon 5. The orientation of the PGK-Neo cassette was the same as that of theATP2A1 gene. The PGK-TK expression cassette was inserted at the HindIII site 0.7 kb downstream from exon 5. The construct was linearized at the NotI site in the vector and transfected by electroporation into ES cells. Twenty-four hours after electroporation, the cells were exposed to G418 at 200 μg/ml and 2 μm gancyclovir to select cells containing theneo gene and lacking the HSV-tk gene, respectively. Three hundred clones resistant to both drugs were picked and expanded 10 days after electroporation. DNA from individual ES cell clones was digested with EcoRI and analyzed by nonradioactive Southern blotting (24Zvaritch E. Backx P.H. Jirik F. Kimura Y. de Leon S. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Lester J.W. Kranias E.G. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14985-14991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) using two different probes. Probe 1 was a 1.8-kb HindIII-XbaI fragment located 2.8 kb downstream from exon 5. Probe 2 was a 2-kb fragment specific for theneo gene. Fourteen ES cell lines containing the disruptedATP2A1 gene were used for blastocyst-mediated transgenesis. Blastocyst injection was carried out by Dr. M. Rudnicki (MacMaster University, Hamilton, Canada). Five chimeric mice with 50–70% chimerism were produced and mated to CD1 mice. Germ line transmission of the recombinant gene was achieved with only one chimera, and this mouse was used as a founder of the murine line with targeted ablation of the ATP2A1 gene. Genotyping was performed by nonradioactive Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from tail clips, using probe 1 and probe 2, and by PCR analysis using a combination of three primers that amplify both wild-type and mutant alleles. For PCR analysis, the following primers were used: primer 1 (5′-GGTAGAGCTCCCTGCTGAGGAAGGTAAG-3′), corresponding to genomic sequence in exon 2 that was deleted in the targeted allele; primer 2 (5′-GTCAGCCCGATAGACCTTTCCCAT-3′), complementary to sequence in exon 5; and primer 3 (5′-GCTATTCGGCTATGACTGGGCACAACAGACAATCG-3′), corresponding to the sequence of the neo cassette. PCR conditions for simultaneous amplification of the wild-type 3.6-kb product and the mutant 2.8-kb allele were as follows: denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at 64 °C, and extension for 3 min at 72 °C. Skeletal muscles isolated from hind limb or diaphragm muscle from five mice of the same genotype were combined and homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer in ice-cold buffer consisting of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 20 μm CaCl2, 0.25m sucrose, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete™ protease mixture. Homogenates were centrifuged at 4,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were used for measurement of the Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+transport, as described previously (25Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, Ca2+transport activity in homogenates was assayed in 150 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm MOPS-Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm potassium oxalate, and about 20 μg of protein. For the measurement of Ca2+ dependence of Ca2+ transport, free Ca2+ concentrations were calculated using the computer program of Fabiato and Fabiato (26Fabiato A. Fabiato F. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1979; 75: 463-505PubMed Google Scholar).45Ca2+ was present at a specific activity of about 106 cpm/μmol. The uptake reaction was initiated by the addition of homogenates, incubated at room temperature for 7 min, and stopped by filtration through a 0.3-μm Millipore filter, followed immediately by washing with 10 ml of 100 mm KCl. Radioactivity on the filter was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Experiments were carried out with three independent homogenate preparations. Total homogenates like those used in Ca2+ uptake assays were separated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Primary monoclonal mouse antibodies used were as follows: A52 (diluted 1:5000) against SERCA1; 2A7-A1 (diluted 1:500) against SERCA2a (Affinity Bioreagents Inc.); 34-C (diluted 1:1000) against ryanodine receptors (Affinity Bioreagents); and R3F1 (diluted 1:1000) against Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Research Diagnostic Inc.). Binding of primary antibody was detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody and an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce Super Signal). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Total RNA was isolated from diaphragm or limb muscles using Triazol reagent, following the method described in the kit (Invitrogen). Trace genomic DNA contamination from total RNA was removed by 2 units of DNase I treatment (Ambion) in a 100-μl reaction for 10 min at 37 °C and then extracted once with phenol/chloroform and twice with chloroform. The integrity of each of the RNA samples was assessed by electrophoresis (28 S:18 S ratio), and the concentration was estimated by spectrophotometry using theA260/A280. Two micrograms of total RNA from each sample were subjected to hexamer random primed first-strand cDNA synthesis in a volume of 20 μl using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the guidelines of the manufacturer. The absence of contaminating DNA from each RNA sample was confirmed by PCR by omitting reverse transcriptase from the RT reaction. Equal amounts (2 μl) of the reverse transcription product were subjected to PCR amplification of SERCA1a, SERCA1b, SERCA2a, SERCA2b, SERCA3, phospholamban, and sarcolipin. Analysis of the expression of the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), was carried out to normalize the level of expression of the genes of interest. The step-cycle program was adjusted within the linear range of amplification for specific transcripts. The PCR amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide gels, stained with SYBR Green (Stratagene), and signals were detected using the Fluor-S MultiImager System (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Band intensities of the amplified fragments were normalized to the corresponding amount of GAPDH. Mouse sequences of SERCA1 (GenBankTM accession number NM_007504), SERCA2 (GenBankTM NM_009722), SERCA3 (GenBankTMXM_122224), sarcolipin (GenBankTM NM_025540.1), phospholamban (GenBankTM NM_023129), and GAPDH (GenBankTMM32599) were used to create primers for amplification of SERCA1a and SERCA1b, using sense primer (5′-TTCCTCATCCTCTATGTCGACC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CTGAAGATGCATGGCTATTGG-3′); SERCA2a, using sense primer (5′-TGATCCTCATGGATGAGACG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CCACATCACACAGTGAGTTGG-3′); SERCA2b, using sense primer (5′-TGATCCTCATGGATGAGACG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-AGTCAAGACCAGAACATATCGC-3′); both SERCA1 and SERCA2, using sense primer (5′-GACGAGTTTGGGGAGCAGCT-3′) and antisense primer (5′-AGGTGGTGATGACAGCAGG-3′); both SERCA2 and SERCA3, using sense primer (5′-TGCCTGGT(G/A)GAGAAGATGAATG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CCCTTCACAAACATCTTGC-3′); sarcolipin, using sense primer (5′-GTCCTTCTGGAGTTCTCATCC-3′) and antisense primer (5′-GTCAGGCATTGTGAGTGTGG-3′); phospholamban, using sense primer (5′-TGCCTTCCTGGCATAATGG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-ATGTTGCAGGTCTGGAGTGG-3′); and GAPDH, using sense primer (5′-CTTCACCACCATGGAGAAGG-3′) and antisense primer (5′-CATGGACTGTGGTCATGAGC-3′). The enzymes and fragment sizes used to confirm and discriminate specific transcripts are listed in TableI. To measure the relative ratio of SERCA1a to SERCA1b expression, SERCA1a and SERCA1b primers were used to co-amplify the SERCA1a and SERCA1b fragments. Since the two fragments differ in length by 42 bp, with the longer fragment representing the adult form, SERCA1a, they could be distinguished and quantified. To determine the levels of SERCA2a and SERCA2b, sets of specific primers were used to amplify SERCA2a and SERCA2b individually. To measure the SERCA1 to SERCA2 and SERCA2 to SERCA3 mRNA ratios, the co-amplified products were digested using the specific enzymes listed in Table I to produce digestion fragments that could be used for quantification.Table IAmplified fragments and enzymes used to confirm and discriminate specific transcripts by semiquantitative RT-PCRIsoformProduct sizeDiagnostic restriction enzymeCleavage productsbpbpSERCA1192NcoI113, 79SERCA2192BanI113, 79SERCA2213PvuII117, 96SERCA3213AvaI126, 87SERCA1a265BglII181, 84SERCA1b223AvaII147, 76SERCA2a215DdeI162, 53SERCA2b211MspI155, 56PLN204DpnI149, 55SLN250AvaII135, 115GAPDH254BglI177, 77Each fragment amplified using a specific set of primers was confirmed by digestion with a diagnostic restriction enzyme.

The ratios between the two transcripts co-amplified for SERCA1 and SERCA2 and for SERCA2 and SERCA3 were quantified using the digestion fragments obtained with the appropriate enzyme. Experiments were performed on isolated diaphragm muscle strips from newborn homozygous ATP2A1 mice and their wild-type littermates. Isometric contractile properties of diaphragm muscles were measured in vitro from neonatal mice within 0.5–5 h following delivery by caesarian section on day 19 or 20 of embryogenesis. Each diaphragm muscle was exposed, removed with intact ribs and tendons, and placed into oxygenated Krebs solution (95% O2, 5% CO2) containing 118 mm NaCl, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 1.2 mm KHPO4, 1.9 mm CaCl2, and 1.2 mmMgSO4, pH 7.4, and maintained at 4–10 °C. Each diaphragm was trimmed and cut into a single strip suitable for study. Diaphragm muscle was mounted vertically in a jacketed muscle bath (Radnotti Glass, Monrovia, CA) containing oxygenated Krebs solution (33 °C) between a plexiglass clamp and a servomotor (Cambridge Technologies, model 300H Dual Mode Servo) used to measure force output. Stimulation was applied by a Grass S88 stimulator (Grass Instruments, Quincy, MA) via closely flanking platinum wire electrodes. A supramaximal stimulation voltage was used (110–120 V) with a pulse duration of 0.2 ms. Force data were collected on-line using a 640A signal interface (Aurora Scientific Inc.) connected to a National Instruments 16-bit A/D card and analyzed using the Dynamic Muscle Control and Data Acquisition (DMC) and Dynamic Muscle Analysis (DMA) Software (Aurora Scientific). Muscle length was adjusted to obtain maximal isometric twitch force. Peak isometric force amplitude (g) and the maximal rates of force development (+dF/dt) and relaxation (−dF/dt) were determined during a twitch and across a range of stimulation frequencies from 10 to 100 Hz. Diaphragm fatigability was also assessed using a 3-min stimulation protocol consisting of 350-ms contractions at 100 Hz, once per second Fatigue data are expressed as a percentage of initial force data. After the contractile and fatigue properties were measured, the diaphragm muscle strips were trimmed of the remnants of the central tendon and rib, blotted on filter paper, and weighed on an analytical balance. Total muscle fiber cross-sectional area of each muscle strip was determined by dividing the muscle mass (mg) by the product of muscle length and 1.06 mg/mm3, the density of mammalian skeletal muscle. Force data were normalized for total muscle fiber cross-sectional area. After genotyping, samples from animals in some 2 dozen litters were collected and processed by various pathological techniques: 1) paraffin embedding for histopathological evaluation of entire 10-, 15-, and 18-day embryos and term neonatal mice; 2) paraffin embedding of limb and diaphragm muscles from neonatal term mice; and 3) electron microscopy of limb and diaphragm muscles of term mice. For paraffin studies, whole bodies of neonatal or embryonic mice were fixed by immersion in 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 5 μm, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and analyzed by light microscopy. Diaphragm and limb muscles were dissected immediately after death, flash-frozen in OCT blocks cooled by isopentane in liquid nitrogen, and cut into 5-μm sections for analysis. For electron microscopy, diaphragm and limb muscles were fixed in situ by injection of 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde (in 200 mm Sørensen's phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) into the thoracic and abdominal cavities immediately after death. The diaphragm and limb muscles were then dissected into 1 × 1-mm cubes and immersed again in the same fixative at 4 °C. Muscle was processed for electron microscopy by postfixation with 1% osmium tetroxide in water for 1 h, washed in water, and dehydrated with ethanol and propylene oxide. Dehydrated tissues were embedded in plastic, sectioned at 60 nm, and stained with 5% uranyl acetate and 1% lead. Sections were viewed and photographed on a Hitachi60 electron microscope. Primary myoblast cultures were established from the limbs of E19 SERCA1+/+ and SERCA1−/− embryos, as described in Ref. 27Neville C. Rosenthal N. McGrew M. Bogdanova N. Hauschka S. Methods Cell Biol. 1997; 52: 85-116Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. Muscle tissue dissected from all four limbs was dissociated by fine mincing with microdissecting scissors, followed by treatment with 0.125% trypsin and 0.5% pancreatin and 0.01% of DNase (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 30 min at 37 °C. The enzymatic digestion was stopped by the addition of Ham's F-10 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Contaminating fibroblasts were removed selectively by preplating the cell suspension for 1 h at 37 °C. Suspensions enriched in myoblasts were then plated on dishes coated with 0.1% gelatin and grown in 20% fetal bovine serum in Ham's F-10 medium, supplemented with 5 nmbasic fibroblast growth factor. Cells were fed the following day and every third day thereafter. To induce differentiation, the growth medium was changed to 2% horse serum in Ham's F-10. The strategy illustrated in Fig.1A was followed to disrupt theATP2A1 gene. The targeting construct of 7.5 kb (middle panel of Fig. 1A) consisted of mouse genomic sequence in which the neo gene substituted for 4.2 kb of the ATP2A1 gene, corresponding to a 3′ portion of the promoter sequence and a 5′ fragment of the coding sequence, which included exons 1–4. After electroporation of ES cells, 300 colonies survived positive-negative selection in G418 and gancyclovir. Southern blot analysis using probe 1 (Fig. 1B) and probe 2 (data not shown) revealed that 14 clones contained the 6.4-kb EcoRI fragment that was diagnostic of a targeted allele. Blastocyst-mediated transgenesis yielded five male chimeric mice, but the progeny of only one of these mice carried the targeted allele in its germ line after breeding with wild-type females. After five generations of cross breeding with CD1 strain mice, heterozygous mice were mated to produce wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant offspring, as demonstrated by PCR analysis of tail DNA (Fig. 1C). Genotype analysis of 299 offspring of heterozygous matings yielded 81 (27%) wild-type, 144 (48%) heterozygous, and 74 (25%) homozygous mutant mice, which is almost identical to a normal 1:2:1 Mendelian ratio. All pups were born alive, and SERCA1−/− mice were indistinguishable from wild-type SERCA1+/+ littermates in their gross appearance at birth. The average birth weight (g) of SERCA1+/+ (1.4 ± 0.08), SERCA1+/− (1.37 ± 0.11), and SERCA1−/− (1.38 ± 0.13) mice did not differ significantly. Within minutes, SERCA1−/− animals displayed abnormal signs that were characterized by gasping respiration, limited chest wall movements, and progressive cyanosis. Affected mice demonstrated slow limb movements and delayed relaxation of skeletal muscles that was reminiscent of the cramping that characterizes Brody patients. Unfortunately, contractile measurements on skeletal muscles in these mice were not feasible due to the fragile texture and small size of the limb muscles. We assume that the contractile properties of the limb muscles would be similar to those observed with diaphragm muscle and would, therefore, be consistent with our observations on the movements of the live animals. SERCA1−/− mice died within 30 min to 2 h after birth. A survey of multiple organs from 10-, 15-, and 18-day SERCA1−/−embryos revealed no significant morphological abnormalities (data not shown). Studies of term SERCA1−/− mice that died shortly after birth of respiratory failure revealed prominent hypercontracted regions in scattered fibers (Figs. 2,G and H) and increased fiber size variability (Fig. 2H) in diaphragm muscle. Morphological analysis of hind limb muscles of SERCA1−/− and SERCA1+/+mice revealed uniform fiber size and no pathological alterations in myofiber architecture (data not shown). Analysis of the lung of SERCA1−/− mice revealed diffuse congestion and hypercellularity (Fig. 2F). In contrast, analysis of SERCA1+/+ animals revealed uniform"

The Sp/KLF proteins play diverse roles in regulating gene expression during development. For example, EKLF/KLF1 is important for β-globin gene expression (5Nuez B. Michalovich D. Bygrave A. Ploemacher R. Grosveld F. Nature. 1995; 375: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 6Perkins A.C. Sharpe A.H. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), and LKLF/KLF2 plays critical roles in lung development, T cell maturation, and in endothelial cells (7Kuo C.T. Veselits M.L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21180-21185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Sp/KLF proteins contain a characteristic DNA binding domain (DBD) at or near their C terminus that consists of three Krüppel-type Cys2His2 zinc fingers that bind GC and CACCC boxes in regulatory elements of genes. Different members of the family exhibit similar DNA-binding specificity, but in general the Sp1-like subgroup has a higher affinity for GC boxes and the KLF subgroup proteins bind more strongly to CACCC sequences. Once bound to DNA the proteins are thought to regulate transcription by recruiting co-regulatory molecules. The N-terminal domains of different Sp/KLF family members exhibit little or no homology, and differential cofactor recruitment by these divergent domains may in part explain why some members behave as activators, whereas others act as repressors. The situation is complex as other regions of the proteins, such as the zinc finger domain also mediate protein-protein interactions, and individual proteins may recruit both co-activators and co-repressors. For instance, EKLF/KLF1 has been shown to activate transcription by recruiting the histone acetylase proteins p300/CBP and P/CAF through its N terminus and the chromatin remodeling complex E·RC1 through its zinc finger domain (10Armstrong J.A. Bieker J.J. Emerson B.A. Cell. 1999; 95: 93-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The zinc finger domain can also recruit a histone deacetylase complex to silence gene expression (11Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Other KLFs that can repress transcription include BKLF/KLF3, KLF8, and Ap-2rep/KLF12. These proteins recruit co-repressors of the C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) family (12Schuierer M. Hilger-Eversheim K. Dobner T. Bosserhoff A.K. Moser M. Turner J. Crossley M. Buettner R. J. Biol.

Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Their interaction with CtBP is mediated through a short amino acid motif, of the form Pro-X-Asp-Leu-Ser (PXDLS), that is present in all three proteins (13Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Aside from this motif, there is very little homology between the N-terminal repression domains of BKLF/KLF3, KLF8, and Ap-2rep/ KLF12. The CtBP co-repressors bind numerous other regulatory proteins, including many conventional DNA-binding proteins, and accessory molecules, such as polycomb and the viral protein E1A (13Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The mode of action of CtBP is yet to be fully elucidated. CtBP proteins can recruit histone deacetylases (16Zhang C.L. McKinsey T.A. Lu Jr., Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 17Sundqvist A. Sollerbrant K. Svensson C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 183-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), however, deacetylase-independent repression has also been observed. CtBP interacts with polycomb group proteins (18Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and proteins such as Ikaros (19Koipally J. Georgopoulos K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19594-19602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) that are contained in chromatin remodeling complexes, suggesting that CtBP proteins may also participate in regulation of gene expression through the non-covalent modification of chromatin structure. We have found that BKLF/KLF3 is a potent transcriptional repressor, and during our analysis of transcriptional repression by BKLF (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), we noted that abrogation of CtBP recruitment does not entirely abolish this function. This suggested that BKLF may recruit one or more additional cofactors to regulate transcription. A two-hybrid screen against BKLF identified the LIM-only protein FHL3 as another BKLF partner protein. FHL3 is a member of the recently recognized four and half LIM domain (FHL) family, which consists of FHL1–4, ACT, and KyoT1 (20Taniguchi Y. Furukawa T. Tun T. Han H. Honjo T. Mol. Cell.

These proteins are made up of four LIM domains, plus one N-terminal “half” LIM domain whose amino acid sequence resembles that of a single GATA type zinc finger. LIM domains are composed of a double zinc finger motif that co-ordinate two zinc ions and are primarily thought to mediate protein-protein interactions (27Bach I. Mech. Dev. 2000; 91: 5-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). The term LIM originates from the isolation of three Caenorhabditis elegans transcription factors, LIN-11,Isl-1, and Mec-3, proteins in which this domain was first described (28Freyd G. Kim S.K. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1990; 344: 876-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). FHL1 and 2 are highly expressed in skeletal muscle and have been observed to be present in the cytoplasm. Consequently FHL proteins were originally hypothesized to play a role in cytoskeletal function in muscle cells (24Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Charleston B. Pell J.M. Loughna P.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 840-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recently, however, FHL family members have also been detected in the nucleus, and it now appears that in this compartment several FHL family members function as transcriptional co-regulators. The testis-specific protein ACT serves as a co-activator of CREM and CREB (21Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and its restricted expression pattern helps explain how testis-specific gene activation by CREM is mediated. FHL2 has been shown to act as a specific co-activator of the androgen receptor (AR) (23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) and the zinc finger protein Wilms tumor-1 (WT1) (29Du X. Hublitz P. Gunther T. Wilhelm D. Englert C. Schule R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and as a co-repressor of the multi-zinc finger protein PLZF (30McLoughlin P. Ehler E. Carlile G. Licht J.D. Schafer B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37045-37053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Sub-cellular partitioning also appears to be important for the regulation of FHL function. FHL2 has been observed in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, and its translocation to the nucleus in response to Rho signaling can lead to potent stimulation of AR-mediated gene expression (31Muller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 736-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Additionally, ACT interacts with the kinesin KIF17b, and this interaction is thought to regulate its nuclear/cytoplasmic partitioning (32Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To date, the FHL proteins described have been found to behave as conventional transcriptional co-regulators, raising the possibility that they may be involved in recruiting the basal transcriptional machinery or chromatin remodeling enzymes, but their precise mechanism of action has not yet been defined. Here we show that FHL3 binds BKLF and acts as a co-repressor. We also demonstrate that FHL3 contacts CtBP2, a separate BKLF co-repressor. Because sub-cellular distribution of FHL factors may affect their function, we were interested in examining the cellular location of FHL3. We present evidence that FHL3, CtBP2, and BKLF proteins exist in a large complex only in the nucleus and that FHL3 is significantly enriched in the nucleus only when it is co-expressed with both BKLF and CtBP2. We suggest that FHL3, and other members of the FHL family, operate as linking modules that stabilize multiprotein transcriptional complexes in the nucleus in addition to their reported roles in the cytoplasm. The Clontech two-hybrid system was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. A human erythroleukemia (K562) cell cDNA library in the gal4 activation domain (AD) fusion vector, pGAD10, was transfected into the yeast strain HF7c harboring the gal4DBD-BKLF-(1–268) fusion protein expressed from pGBT9. Candidate interactors were re-tested by co-transfecting gal4DBD-bait proteins and gal4AD-prey proteins into HF7c. Transformants were selected on Trp/Leu-deficient plates and patched onto Trp/Leu/His-deficient media. Growth was scored after 30 h. Controls containing bait and prey alone were also conducted and were negative for growth up to more than 72 h. Full-length BKLF and FHL3 were cloned into the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), and 35S-labeled in vitro translated proteins were generated using T7 polymerase and the TnT system fromPromega. GST fusion proteins were prepared and binding assays were carried out as previously described (33Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled 300-bp fragment from the coding sequence of FHL3 was used to probe two commercial filters, a multiple tissue Northern blot containing mRNA from human adult tissues, and a blot containing mRNA from various cancer cell lines, both from Clontech. Hybridization was performed at high stringency, using ExpressHyb (Clontech). These membranes were stripped and re-probed using a human β-actin probe supplied by Clontech. NIH-3T3 cells were cultured and transfected, using the calcium phosphate method, as described previously, as were chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and growth hormone reporter assays (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). COS cells were cultured and transfected, using the DEAE-dextran method, as previously described (15van Vliet J. Turner J. Crossley M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1955-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). K562 stable cell lines expressingBKLF were generated as described (34Crossley M. Tsang A.P. Bieker J.J. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15440-15444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the expression vector pEF1α.neo.BKLF. Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (35Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared during the procedure for preparation of nuclear extracts as above. To generate antibody-bead conjugates, 100 μl of pre-immune or immune sera was incubated with 100 μl of protein-A-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to a final volume of 1 ml with PBS, for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were then washed twice with 10 volumes of 200 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, and were resuspended in 10 volumes of 200 mm sodium borate, pH 9.0, with dimethylpimilimidate (Sigma) at a final concentration of 20 mm. Cross-linking was performed for 30 min at room temperature, and the reaction was stopped by washing once with 10 volumes of 200 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.0, and then incubation with 200 mm ethanolamine, pH 8.0, for 2 h at room temperature. Beads were then washed twice with 10 volumes of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.8, to remove non-cross-linked antibody, washed once with 10 volumes PBS, and resuspended in PBS. For immunoprecipitation of nuclear extracts, 80–100 μl of extract from transfected COS cells were diluted 1:3 with Nonidet P-40 buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40/Igepal, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 8.0, 1 μg/μl leupeptin, 1 μg/μl aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The solution was pre-cleared with 10 μl each of protein-A and protein-G beads at 4 °C for 30 min. The supernatant was then immunoprecipitated with 10 μl of anti-BKLF or anti-FHL3 beads, or the corresponding pre-immune beads, with incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer with 100 mm dithiothreitol. The samples were treated at 60 °C for 5 min, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose overnight at 100 mA. Blots were then probed by standard Western blotting techniques with the appropriate primary antibody then bound with the appropriate secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and were detected using the PerkinElmer Life Sciences Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus kit. For immunoprecipitation of cytoplasmic extracts, a higher salt buffer was used during the immunoprecipitation step to maintain the salt concentration equivalent to that used for nuclear extracts. Subsequent washes were performed with the 150 mm NaCl Nonidet P-40 buffer. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were applied to a Superose6TM column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm EDTA and run at 0.25 ml·min−1 at 4 °C. The eluant was monitored at 280 nm. 1-ml fractions were collected, and constituent proteins were precipitated with 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid (Sigma). After washing with cold ethanol, samples were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and treated as described above for immunoprecipitation experiments. Protein standards were applied to the column separately (blue dextran, 2000 kDa; thyroglobulin, 670 kDa; ferritin, 440kDa; catalase, 232 kDa; aldolase, 158 kDa; albumin, 67 kDa; chymotrypsinogen A, 25 kDa; ribonuclease A, 14 kDa; Amersham Biosciences). A fusion protein between GST and full-length FHL3 was prepared as described (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein was then eluted from the GSH-agarose beads using 25 mm glutathione (GSH) in elution buffer (100 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 120 mm NaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The GSH-agarose beads were pelleted and re-extracted. The eluates were pooled, and the protein concentration was determined. The protein was lyophilized, and four 300-μg doses were used as antigens for rabbit inoculation. Inoculation and sera collection were performed by the Veterinary Services Division of the Institute of Medical and Veterinary Sciences (101 Blacks Rd., Gilles Plains, S.A., 5086, Australia). We have previously shown that BKLF can recruit the co-repressor protein CtBP2 to repress transcription (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). A short amino acid motif in BKLF, Pro-Val-Asp-Leu-Thr (PVDLT), is required for the interaction between BKLF and CtBP2, and when this motif is disrupted, repression by BKLF is compromised. However, some repression by BKLF is retained even when the PVDLT motif is mutated (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). This suggested that BKLF might recruit additional cofactors to repress transcription. We thus carried out a further two-hybrid screen to identify additional BKLF cofactors. The bait used in this screen consisted of the gal4DBD fused to amino acids 1–268 of BKLF (encompassing the repression domain of BKLF (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)). We screened a human erythroleukemia cell (K562) cDNA library. K562 cells express embryonic and fetal globins and are frequently used as a model of erythroid cells at the fetal stage of development (36Konopka J.B. Watanabe S.M. Witte O.N. Cell. 1984; 37: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 37Dean A. Ley T.J. Humphries R.K. Fordis M. Schechter A.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5515-5519Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This library was used as BKLF is highly expressed in erythroid cells (35Crossley M. Whitelaw E. Perkins A. Williams G. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1695-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and is believed to play a role in hematopoiesis (38Perkins A.C. Yang H. Crossley P.M. Fujiwara Y. Orkin S.H. Blood. 1997; 90 Suppl. 1: 575Google Scholar, 39Turner J. Crossley M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1169-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We screened 4 × 105 clones: 132 primaryHis+ colonies were isolated, 10 of which were also positive for the lacZ reporter. Sequencing revealed two clones that carried an 899-bp cDNA insert that matched the human gene termed four and a half LIM protein 3 (FHL3) (25Morgan M.J. Madgwick A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As a first test for the specificity of the interaction, these isolates were tested against the gal4DBD alone and negative control baits, including gal4DBDs fused to p53, the N finger of GATA-1, and lamin C protein. No interactions were observed (data not shown). We also swapped FHL3 into the bait plasmid and tested the ability of a gal4DBD-FHL3 bait to interact with a gal4AD-BKLF prey. As shown in Fig.1A the interaction is again observed, whereas there is no interaction with the negative control prey, gal4AD alone. The clones we isolated lacked half of the C-terminal LIM domain of FHL3. To isolate the full-length clone, primers were designed to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number HSU60116), and the K562 cDNA library was used as a template in a polymerase chain reaction. The resulting product was cloned, and sequencing confirmed the presence of a full-length cDNA encoding human FHL3. To verify this interaction in another system, a GST-FHL3 fusion protein was produced by expression in Escherichia coli. The protein was immobilized on GSH-agarose beads (Fig. 1B, lower panel) and mixed with radiolabeled BKLF generated by in vitro transcription and translation in the presence of [35S]methionine. GST-FHL3 strongly retained [35S]BKLF (Fig. 1B, lane 3,upper panel), whereas a negative control protein GST alone retained no BKLF protein (lane 2, upper panel). Thus, BKLF can interact with FHL3 in both a yeast two-hybrid assay, as either bait or prey, and in GST pull-down assays. Because FHL3 was first identified as a gene that was highly expressed in muscle cells, we wished to test whether it was expressed at appreciable levels in K562 and other selected cells. We probed a Northern blot containing RNA from various cancer cell lines, including K562 cells, with a probe generated from a portion of the coding sequence of FHL3 (Fig.2A). FHL3 message was detected in the K562 sample, and low level expression was also found in HeLa (fibroblast), SW480 (colorectal adenocarcinoma), A599 (lung carcinoma), and MOLT-4 (melanoma) RNA. We also probed a Northern blot of mRNA from various adult tissues and observed high level expression in skeletal muscle as well as lower levels in heart (Fig.2B). Thus, FHL3 mRNA is present not only in muscle tissue, as previously observed, but in erythroid cells of fetal type and other cancer cell lines. This result is consistent with other reports that FHL proteins function in several different cell types in addition to muscle cells. BKLF interacts with CtBP2 through a PVDLT motif centered around amino acid 72 (14). To determine whether FHL3 interacts with BKLF through this CtBP-contact region or through a distinct region, a series of BKLF deletions was generated. These constructs produce gal4DBD-BKLF fusion proteins and were tested for their ability to interact with gal4AD-FHL3 in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1C). This experiment indicated that FHL3 interacts strongly with BKLF in a region that lies between amino acids 160 and 224, but that amino acids 75–160 also contribute to binding. Importantly, this region is distinct from the domain in BKLF that binds CtBP2 (amino acids 51–75 (14Turner J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5129-5140Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)), and mutation of the PVDLT motif, which abrogates CtBP2 binding, has no effect on the interaction of BKLF with FHL3 (Fig. 1C). This raises the possibility that BKLF may be able to interact with both FHL3 and CtBP2 simultaneously, and the proximity of the FHL3 and CtBP2 binding sites within BKLF suggested that FHL3 might also make contacts with CtBP2 (see below). To determine whether FHL3 could bind CtBP2, we first used the yeast two-hybrid assay. We tested whether a gal4DBD-FHL3 protein could interact with a gal4AD-CtBP2 protein. A strong interaction was observed between FHL3 and CtBP2, and no interaction was seen with the gal4AD alone (Fig.3A). This interaction was also observed in a GST pull-down assay (Fig. 3B), as GST-FHL3 retained radiolabeled CtBP2 (lane 3), whereas GST alone did not (lane 2). The retention of radiolabeled CtBP2 by FHL3 in GST pull-down assays was generally low but was reproducible (see also Fig. 4C). Thus, FHL3 can also interact with CtBP2 in both a yeast two-hybrid assay and in GST pull-down assays. Interestingly, although the vast majority of CtBP-interacting proteins contain a PXDLS-like amino acid motif required for binding CtBP (13Turner J. Crossley M. Bioessays. 2001; 23: 683-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), FHL3 has no obvious PXDLS motif (see “Discussion”).Figure 4Mapping of the domains in FHL3 that bind BKLF and CtBP2. A, GST fusion proteins were prepared with various combinations of LIM domains from FHL3 and tested for binding to35S-labeled BKLF (B) and 35S-labeled CtBP2 (C) using GST pull-down assays. Results are summarized in Table I. Lane 1 in A contains molecular weight markers, and the Input lanes (lane 1) inB and C contain 20% of the radiolabeled BKLF and CtBP2, respectively, used in the assay. Equivalent amounts of GST-fusion proteins were used in each assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We used both GST pull-down assays and the yeast two-hybrid assay to determine which domains in FHL3 interacted with BKLF and which with CtBP2. A series of GST-FHL3 deletion constructs were generated and used in GST pull-down assays with radiolabeled BKLF and CtBP2 (TableI, and Fig. 4, B and C). The same domains of FHL3 were also used in the yeast two-hybrid system, as gal4DBD fusions, and were tested against galAD fusions with both BKLF (amino acids 1–268) and CtBP2. A summary of the GST pull-down assays and yeast two-hybrid assays is shown in Table I. The results indicate that LIM domains half, 1, and 2 (H–1–2) are sufficient for interaction with BKLF, whereas, only LIM domains half and 1 of FHL3 are sufficient for the interaction with CtBP2. Other domains of FHL3, however, also appear to contact BKLF and CtBP2 (for instance LIM domains 3–4 contact both BKLF and CtBP2, and LIM domain 4 contacts CtBP2), and in some instances results of the yeast two-hybrid assay and the GST pull-down assays are not consistent. Overall, these experiments suggest that folding of the entire FHL3 protein may be important and that the complete binding surfaces may be more complex than just one discreet contiguous domain. Our results are similar to previous attempts to map the interaction between FHL2 and the AR (23Muller J.M. Isele U. Metzger E. Rempel A. Moser M. Pscherer A. Breyer T. Holubarsch C. Buettner R. Schule R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 359-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) or PLZF (30McLoughlin P. Ehler E. Carlile G. Licht J.D. Schafer B.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37045-37053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In these cases, deletion studies showed that the LIM domains H–1–2 and 3–4 of FHL2 both interact with the AR with similar affinities (22Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8613-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and no single LIM domain of FHL2 was capable of interacting with PLZF (29Du X. Hublitz P. Gunther T. Wilhelm D. Englert C. Schule R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together these experiments are consistent with the view that the four and a half LIM domains in these proteins fold into a complex protein interaction surface that may wrap"

We analyzed wild type PrP in comparison with different PrP mutants and identified determinants of the in vivo folding pathway of PrP. The complete N terminus of PrP including the putative transmembrane domain and the first β-strand could be deleted without interfering with PrP maturation. Helix 1, however, turned out to be a major determinant of PrP folding. Disruption of helix 1 prevented attachment of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor and the formation of complexN-linked glycans; instead, a high mannose PrP glycoform was secreted into the cell culture supernatant. In the absence of a C-terminal membrane anchor, however, helix 1 induced the formation of unglycosylated and partially protease-resistant PrP aggregates. Moreover, we could show that the C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence, independent of its role in GPI anchor attachment, mediates core glycosylation of nascent PrP. Interestingly, conversion of high mannose glycans to complex type glycans only occurred when PrP was membrane-anchored. Our study indicates a bipartite function of helix 1 in the maturation and aggregation of PrP and emphasizes a critical role of a membrane anchor in the formation of complex glycosylated PrP.

Neuropathologic, genetic, and transgenic studies argue strongly in favor of a causal role of protein misfolding in the pathogenic process. Beyond this conceptual framework, prion diseases are exceptional in that they exist as sporadic, genetic, and infectious forms. Prion diseases are characterized by the formation of PrPSc,1 an abnormally folded isoform of the cellular prion protein PrPC, a highly conserved protein mainly present at the plasma membrane of neuronal and lymphatic cells. During transit through the secretory pathway, the C-terminal domain of PrPC is modified by the attachment of two N-linked complex carbohydrate moieties (Asn180 and Asn196) (1Stimson E. Hope J.

Structural studies revealed that the mammalian prion protein is composed of a flexibly disordered N terminus and a structured C-terminal domain. This autonomously folding domain contains three α-helical regions and a short, two-stranded β-sheet (6Donne D.G. Viles J.H. Groth D. Mehlhorn I. James T.L. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Wright P.E.

Indeed, the C-terminal region seems to confer pathogenicity; after limited proteolysis of PrPSc, a C-terminal fragment, denoted PrP 27–30 (aa ∼90–230), is formed which transmits the disease. Furthermore, studies in transgenic mice indicated that N-terminally truncated PrPC molecules (Δ23–89) support PrPSc propagation (9Fischer M. Rülicke T. Raeber A. Sailer A. Moser M. Oesch B.

Molecular dynamics simulations of human PrP suggest that the structured part of the protein is stabilized by the N-linked glycans. Moreover, the two partially sialylated oligosaccharide moieties generate a negative electrostatic field that covers the whole surface of helix 2 and helix 3 (11Zuegg J. Gready J.E. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 959-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Regarding the possible physiological or pathological relevance, PrP glycosylation has been shown to have an impact on the conformational transition of PrPCinto PrPSc, to influence the selective neuronal targeting of PrPSc, and to contribute to the phenomenon of strain diversity (12Collinge J.

The co- and posttranslational modifications of PrPC are initiated with the cleavage of the N-terminal signal peptide (aa 1–22) and the transfer of core glycans while the nascent chain is still associated with the translocon. Shortly after the protein is fully translocated the GPI anchor is attached to the acceptor amino acid close to the C terminus. The final maturation of PrPCincludes the processing of the core glycans into complex type glycans, a series of enzymatic reactions in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi compartment. Every asparagine present in the consensus sequence Asn-X-Ser and Asn-X-Thr can serve as an acceptor site for N-linked glycosylation; however, not all such sites present in a polypeptide are actually modified. Similarly, it is unknown why some of the core glycans, like those present in PrPC, are terminally processed, whereas others remain as high mannose structures. So far, it is assumed that the structure of the polypeptide is an important determinant for both modifications. In this study, we analyzed the in vivo folding and maturation of PrPC and showed that helix 1 as well as membrane attachment play a crucial role in the postranslational modifications of PrPC. For ectopic expression of PrP, pcDNA3.1–3F4 was used, which contains the mouse PRNP modified to express PrP-L108M/V111M for immunostaining with the monoclonal antibody 3F4 (21Gilch S. Winklhofer K.F. Nunziante M. Lucassen R. Spielhaupter C. Muranyi W. Groschup M.H. Riesner D. Tatzelt J. Schätzl H.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3957-3966Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Amino acid deletions and substitutions were introduced by PCR cloning techniques. The deletions include the following amino acids: ΔGPI, aa 230–254; ΔTM, aa 113–133; ΔH1, aa 141–171; ΔH1*, aa 144–156; ΔN, aa 27–89. In PrPmtGPI, the serines at positions 230–232 have been replaced by threonines. For the generation of PrP-CD4, the CD4 transmembrane sequence and cytoplasmic tail (aa 395–457) were fused to the C terminus of PrPΔGPI. CD4 sequences were amplified by PCR from pSPOX-CD4PrP (22Taraboulos A. Scott M. Semenov A. Avrahami D. Laszlo L. Prusiner S.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). All amino acid numbers refer to the mouse PrP sequence (GenBankTM accession numberM18070). The mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 was described earlier (23Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N2a and ScN2a cells were cultivated as described (24Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SH-SY5Y is a human neuroblastoma cell line (DSMZ number ACC 209). SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected by a liposome-mediated method using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 1-Deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) or castanospermine (Calbiochem) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added to the cell culture medium (10 μg/ml). For endo H digestion, protein lysates were adjusted to 0.5% SDS, boiled for 10 min, and then digested with endoglycosidase H (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 37 °C as specified by the manufacturer. As described previously (25Tatzelt J. Prusiner S.B. Welch W.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6363-6373Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped off of the plate, pelleted by centrifugation, and lysed in cold buffer A (0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate in PBS). The lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. After boiling in Laemmli sample buffer, supernatants and pellets were examined by immunoblotting. For proteolysis experiments, cells were lysed as described above and incubated with proteinase K (PK) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at the concentrations indicated in Fig. 6 at 4 °C for 60 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Pefabloc SC (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Residual PrP was detected by Western blotting. RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting as described earlier (26Winklhofer K.F. Reintjes A. Hoener M.C. Voellmy R. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45160-45167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). RNA bound to the membrane was hybridized with a 32P-labeled DNA probe specific for mouse BiP. As a positive control, mock-transfected cells were incubated with tunicamycin (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) for 1 h prior to RNA extraction. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence were performed as described previously (26Winklhofer K.F. Reintjes A. Hoener M.C. Voellmy R. Tatzelt J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45160-45167Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A Leica TCSNT/DMIRB confocal system (Heerbrugg, Switzerland) was used for confocal laser-scanning microscopy. Quantification was performed using AIDA 1.0 image analysis software (Raytest). Cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and subsequently labeled for 30 or 60 min with 300 μCi/ml Pro-mix L-[35S] in vitro cell label mix (Amersham Biosciences; >37 TBq/mmol) in methionine-free modified Eagle's medium medium. For the chase, the labeling medium was removed, and the cells were washed twice and then incubated in complete medium for the time indicated. Immunoprecipitation of PrP was carried out as described previously (24Winklhofer K.F. Tatzelt J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 463-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Gels were impregnated with Amplify (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and exposed to film. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then maintained on ice. Phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PIPLC) (Roche Molecular Biosciences) in PBS was added to the cells for 2 h at 4 °C (0.5 units/ml). The cells were washed extensively with PBS and then lysed with cold buffer A. The distribution of PrP was analyzed by the detergent solubility assay (see above). For PIPLC treatment of extracts, cells were lysed in Triton buffer (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS), and PIPLC was added to the lysate. After incubation on ice for 1 h, extracts were fractionated by centrifugation and analyzed by Western blotting. Trypsin treatment (0.25%, w/v) of the intact cells was carried out in the cell culture dish on ice. The digest was terminated by the addition of soy bean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen). The cells were collected by a brief centrifugation, washed with trypsin inhibitor, and then lysed in cold buffer A. PrP present in the cell culture supernatant was precipitated by trichloroacetic acid and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Wild type PrP and mutant PrP sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into the vector pPROEX-HTa (Amersham Biosciences) via the EheI and HindIII restriction sites to add a N-terminal extension of His6. Transformed Escherichia coli DH5α cells were grown at 37 °C to an OD = 0.6, and protein expression was induced for 3 h by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm). PrP was purified under denaturing conditions (8m urea, 50 mm Tris, pH 8) by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Proteins were eluted (8 m urea, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6), and fractions containing PrP were pooled. For the formation of the disulfide bonds, proteins were diluted (0.1 mg/ml) and air-oxidized overnight using CuSO4 (1 μm) as a catalyst (27Hornemann S. Korth C. Oesch B. Riek R. Wider G. Wuthrich K. Glockshuber R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). To concentrate PrP, proteins were adjusted to pH 8 with NaOH, rebound to an Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column, and eluted (8 m urea, 200 mm imidazole, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7). Refolding was induced by 50-fold dilution into 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7. For the limited proteolytic digestion, proteinase K (1 μg/ml; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for the times indicated in Fig. 5. The reactions were stopped by adding 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and boiling in Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. To study PrPC folding in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells, we expressed different PrP mutants with deletions proximal to helices 2 and 3 in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells (Fig.1A). The highly structured helix 2-loop-helix 3 motif was left untouched, because it contains the two complex N-linked glycans and the disulfide bridge, modifications known to be important for proper folding (1Stimson E. Hope J. Chong A. Burlingame A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 2Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H.

Wuthrich K. Nature. 1996; 382: 180-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar). Initially, we used the glycosylation status of the PrP mutants to monitor the efficiency of folding. After transient expression in N2a cells, the PrP mutants were analyzed by endo H digestion and Western blotting (Fig. 1B). Endo H only cleaves high mannose and hybrid structures; consequently, complex type glycans of wild type PrP (wtPrP) could not be liberated by this enzyme (Fig. 1B,wt). Similarly, PrP mutants devoid of the complete N terminus (ΔN, aa 27–89 deleted) or the putative transmembrane domain (ΔTM, aa 113–133 deleted) resisted endo H cleavage, revealing the presence of complex N-linked glycans (Fig. 1B, ΔN and ΔTM). However, after endo H digestion, the electrophoretic mobility of PrPΔH1 (aa 141–171 deleted) and of the double mutant PrPΔNΔH1 (aa 27–89 and 141–171 deleted) increased, indicating that mutants lacking helix 1 were not complex-glycosylated (Fig. 1B, ΔH1 and ΔNΔH1). Since the ΔH1 deletion includes helix 1 (aa 144–156) together with the second β-strand (aa 160–162) of the prion protein, we also tested a construct in which only helix 1 has been deleted (PrPΔH1*). PrPΔH1* expressed in N2a cells showed exactly the same phenotype as PrPΔH1, indicating that the absence of helix 1 was responsible for the observed effect. Of note, a faster migrating PrP species present in cell extracts from PrPΔTM-expressing cells was also sensitive to endo H digestion (Fig. 1B, ΔTM). To investigate the apparent lack of complex glycosylation of PrPΔH1 in more detail, we performed metabolic labeling experiments and analyzed PrP by immunoprecipitation. In addition, transfected cells were treated with DMJ, which inhibits α-mannosidase I, thereby interfering with terminal processing of N-linked glycans (28Fuhrmann U. Bause E. Legler G. Ploegh H. Nature. 1984; 307: 755-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). After the pulse, two major PrP species were detected in wtPrP- and PrPΔTM-expressing cells (Fig.2A, lanes 1 and 3). The faster migrating bands represented PrP containing high mannose N-linked glycans, which could be released by endo H (data not shown). The upper diffuse band was composed of PrP glycoforms that had undergone terminal processing (i.e. contained complex type glycans). Notably, these complex glycosylated PrP species of wtPrP and PrPΔTM were missing in cells that had been treated with DMJ (Fig. 2A,lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, PrPΔH1 was exclusively present as a faster migrating PrP species, identical to PrPΔH1 generated in the presence of DMJ (Fig. 2A,lanes 5 and 6). Pulse/chase experiments revealed that the majority of high mannose glycoforms of wtPrP and PrPΔTM were converted to complex structures within 30 min (Fig. 2B, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, the N-linked glycans of PrPΔH1 were not processed into complex structures (Fig. 2B, lane 6). These initial experiments revealed that deletion of the complete N terminus or of the internal putative transmembrane domain does not interfere with the complex glycosylation of PrP. Deletion of helix 1, however, generates a high mannose glycoform of PrP that is not terminally processed. To analyze the cellular trafficking of PrPΔH1, intact cells were incubated with trypsin to remove all cell surface proteins (Fig. 3A) or with PIPLC to liberate GPI-anchored proteins specifically (Fig.3B). After trypsin treatment, lysates prepared from wtPrP- or PrPΔTM-expressing cells had lost most of their PrP, indicating that it was localized at the cell surface (Fig. 3A,lanes 2 and 4). Similarly, after PIPLC treatment, wtPrP and PrPΔTM were found almost quantitatively in the cell culture supernatant (Fig. 3B, wt, ΔTM, lane 4). In contrast, the relative amount of PrPΔH1 present in extracts prepared from trypsin- or PIPLC-treated cells was not reduced when compared with the mock-treated control, nor was the cell culture supernatant of PIPLC-treated PrPΔH1-expressing cells enriched in PrP (Fig. 3,A, lane 6, and B, ΔH1, lane 4). Because the trypsin and PIPLC treatments were performed at 4 °C, possible secretion of PrPΔH1 would not have been detected in these assays. Therefore, transfected cells were cultivated in serum-free medium for 3 h at 37 °C, and then the cell culture supernatant was analyzed for the presence of PrP. In contrast to wtPrP, PrPΔH1 was efficiently secreted under these conditions. Interestingly, the faster migrating, endo H-sensitive glycoform of PrPΔTM was also secreted into the cell culture supernatant at 37 °C, indicating once more that the deletion of the putative transmembrane domain generated a heterogeneous PrP population, with the major fraction being folded correctly (Fig.3B, lanes 5 and 6). The results of these studies indicated that PrPΔH1 was not GPI-anchored; instead, it was secreted into the cell culture medium. To demonstrate further that PrPΔH1 failed to receive a GPI anchor, we performed an in vitro PIPLC digestion. After cell lysis in cold Triton X-100 buffer (0.1% in PBS) and subsequent centrifugation, wtPrP, like other GPI-anchored proteins, fractionated into the detergent-insoluble phase (Fig. 3C, Pellet,lane 1). Incubation of the cell lysates with PIPLC prior to centrifugation rendered the majority of wtPrP and PrPΔTM Triton X-100 soluble, indicative of their release from the GPI anchor (Fig. 3C, Sup, lanes 2 and 4). PrPΔH1, however, displayed a different solubility profile. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of PrPΔH1 was readily solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer at 4 °C (Fig. 3C, Sup, lane 5). Moreover, after PIPLC digestion of the extracts, the relative amount of PrPΔH1 found in the supernatant fraction was not increased (Fig.3C, Sup, lane 6). Consistent with the results described above (Fig. 3, A andB), the endo H-sensitive glycoform of PrPΔTM was also partially soluble in 0.1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 3C,Sup, lane 3). In the next step, confocal laser-scanning microscopy was performed to corroborate the findings from the biochemical analysis presented above. As expected, wtPrP, PrPΔTM, and PrPΔN were located predominantly on the surface of N2a cells. In cells expressing PrPΔH1 or PrPΔNΔH1, however, PrP immunoreactivity was found exclusively intracellularly, following a distinct pattern indicative of the Golgi compartment (Fig.4, N2a). Since PrPΔH1 is efficiently secreted, the intense staining of the post-ER compartment is probably not due to an intracellular retention but rather illustrates the highest local concentration of PrPΔH1 and PrPΔNΔH1 on their way to the cell surface. To exclude the possibility that either the described effects were specific for N2a cells or endogenous wtPrP might influence the processing of transfected PrP mutants, we included SH-SY5Y cells in our analysis, an established neuroblastoma cell line of human origin that does not express detectable amounts of endogenous PrP (data not shown). Indeed, the analysis of SH-SY5Y cells shown in Fig. 4 corroborated our findings in N2a cells; in SH-SY5Y cells staining of PrPΔH1 and PrPΔNΔH1 was also most intense in the Golgi compartment, whereas wtPrP, PrPΔTM, and PrPΔN were again targeted to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4,SH-SY5Y). Taken together, our data indicated that deletion of helix 1 has a profound effect on posttranslational modifications and cellular trafficking of PrP; GPI anchor attachment is prevented, and a high mannose glycoform of PrPΔH1 is secreted into the cell culture medium. Our data presented above revealed that the presence of helix 1 is a prerequisite for correct folding and trafficking of PrPC. We then thought of a way to interfere with the formation of helix 1 without having to delete this domain. Based on the NMR structure of mouse PrPC, a hydrophobic side chain at residue 204 of helix 3 interacts with phenylalanine 140, glutamic acid 145, tyrosine 148, and tyrosine 149 and thereby provides an essential stabilization of helix 1 structure (Fig. 5A). Of note, this residue, either methionine (human, mouse) or isoleucine (hamster), is extremely well conserved between species (29Wopfner F. Weidenhöfer G. Schneider R. von Brunn A. Gilch S. Schwarz T.F. Werner T. Schätzl H.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1163-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). To disrupt helix 1 packing, we substituted serine or arginine for methionine 204 to create PrP-M204S or PrP-M204R (Fig. 5B). The Western blot analysis presented in Fig. 5C indicated that both PrP-M204S and PrP-M204R did not receive complex glycans and were secreted into the cell culture supernatant, similarly to PrPΔH1. Support for the assumption that wtPrP and PrP-M204S had different conformations was provided by a biochemical characterization of the recombinant proteins. Wild type PrP and PrP-M204S were expressed in E. coli, purified, and oxidized as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 5D). After dilution into an aqueous buffer, the proteins were subjected to a limited proteolysis (Fig. 5E). In the case of r-wtPrP, a fragment of about 15 kDa was generated, most likely comprising the C-terminal globular domain. Western blot analysis with an antibody specific for the C terminus of PrP supported this idea (data not shown). In contrast, r-PrP-M204S was digested without a detectable intermediate (Fig. 5E). Thus, PrPC maturation seems to be dependent on an invariant hydrophobic amino acid located in helix 3, most likely due to a stabilization of helix 1 packing. A limited proteolytic digestion of recombinant wtPrP and PrP-M204S indicated conformational differences between these proteins. Based on previous studies, deletion of the GPI anchor results in the formation of detergent-insoluble PrP molecules that are not glycosylated (30Walmsley A.R. Zeng F.N. Hooper N.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 703-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Rogers M. Yehiely F. Scott M. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Notably, this misfolded PrPΔGPI molecule is a preferred substrate for the formation of a PK-resistant PrP isoform in an in vitro-based conversion model. The phenotype of full-length PrP lacking the C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence is illustrated in Fig. 6A; PrPΔGPI expressed in N2a cells was mainly unglycosylated and secreted into the cell culture medium. Surprisingly, when we deleted helix 1 from PrPΔGPI, we found that the double mutant was core-glycosylated (Fig. 6A, ΔH1ΔGPI). Encouraged by our previous results with the amino acid substitution at position 204, we introduced the same mutation into the GPI anchor-deficient PrP construct. Similarly to the deletion of helix 1, the M204S substitution prevented the formation of unglycosylated PrPΔGPI; PrP-M204SΔGPI was present as a high mannose glycoform sensitive to endo H digestion (Fig. 6A, M204SΔGPI). Support for the assumption that PrPΔGPI and PrP-M204SΔGPI had different conformations was provided by a limited proteolytic digestion. Whereas PrP-M204SΔGPI was PK-sensitive, a significant resistance against PK digestion was observed for PrPΔGPI (Fig. 6B). These results revealed that deletion or destabilization of helix 1 restored core glycosylation of PrPΔGPI in vivo. In contrast to PrPΔGPI, PrP-M204SΔGPI and PrPΔH1ΔGPI were glycosylated and sensitive to a limited proteolytic digestion. From previous studies, it is known that the location of the glycosylation consensus site with respect to its distance from the C terminus influences the efficiency ofN-linked glycosylation (34Whitley P. Nilsson I. Vonheijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In case of the prion protein, both acceptor sites for the core glycans are very close to the C terminus (Asn180 and Asn196). To analyze the role of the C-terminal GPI anchor signal sequence in the core glycosylation of PrPC, we mutated the cleavage/attachment site (ω site) for the GPI anchor. In PrPmtGPI, the serines at positions 230–232 have been replaced by threonines, which was expected to impair the efficiency of GPI anchoring (35Nuoffer C. Horvath A. Riezman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10558-10563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this way, the original length of the nascent PrP polypeptide chain (aa 1–254) wa"

TRAP220 contains two LXXLL motifs (LXM1 and LXM2) that are required for its interaction with NRs. Here we show that the nuclear receptor interaction domain (NID) of TRAP220 interacts weakly with Class I NRs. In contrast, SRC1 NID binds strongly to both Class I and Class II NRs. Interaction assays using nine amino acid LXXLL core motifs derived from SRC1 and TRAP220 revealed no discriminatory NR binding preferences. However, an extended LXM1 sequence containing amino acids −4 to +9, (where the first conserved leucine is +1) showed selective binding to thyroid hormone receptor and reduced binding to estrogen receptor. Replacement of either TRAP220 LXXLL motif with the corresponding 13 amino acids of SRC1 LXM2 strongly enhanced the interaction of the TRAP220 NID with the estrogen receptor. Mutational analysis revealed combinatorial effects of the LXM1 core and flanking sequences in the determination of the NR binding specificity of the TRAP220 NID. In contrast, a mutation that increased the spacing between TRAP220 LXM1 and LXM2 had little effect on the binding properties of this domain. Thus, a 13-amino acid sequence comprising an extended LXXLL motif acts as the key determinant of the NR binding specificity of TRAP220.

The NRs are subdivided into classes depending on their DNA binding and dimerization properties. Class I comprises the steroid hormone receptors, including the estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and progesterone (PR) receptors, which function as homodimers. The largest group (Class II) function as heterodimers with the 9-cis retinoic acid receptor (RXR), and includes receptors for retinoic acid (RAR), vitamin D (VDR), thyroid hormone (TR), and peroxisome proliferators (PPARs). Binding of cognate ligand induces a conformational change in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of NRs, which influences their function with respect to subcellular localization, dimerization, cofactor binding, and transcriptional activity (2Moras D. Gronemeyer H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 384-391Google Scholar). A wide range of NR cofactors have been identified which perform distinct functions at target promoters, including chromatin modification and remodeling and recruitment of the RNA polymerase II holoenzyme (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Google Scholar). A number of cofactors have been shown to bind the LBD directly via short amphipathic α-helices containing the LXXLL sequence (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 5Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar). Structural studies have demonstrated that a hydrophobic channel (AF2) is exposed on the surface of the LBD as a consequence of ligand binding (6Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D.

Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 87-94Google Scholar). This channel accommodates the LXXLL α-helix, which is held in place by hydrophobic interactions and a charged clamp involving two amino acids (lysine and glutamate) that are conserved throughout the NR family (12Shiau A.K. Barstad D. Loria P.M. Cheng L. Kushner P.J. Agard D.A. Greene G.L. Cell. 1998; 95: 927-937Google Scholar, 13Nolte R.T. Wisely G.B. Westin S. Cobb J.E. Lambert M.H. Kurokawa R. Rosenfeld M.G. Willson T.M. Glass C.K. Milburn M.V. Nature. 1998; 395: 137-143Google Scholar). The minimal sequence that can bind the AF2 surface (the LXXLL core motif) is contained within 8 amino acids (−1 to +7) (14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Google Scholar). Different cofactors have been shown to have variable numbers of functional LXXLL motifs. The p160 coactivators SRC1, TIF2/GRIP1, and ACTR/AIB1/pCIP have homologous NR interaction domains (NID) containing three LXXLL motifs (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 5Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Google Scholar, 15Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Tini M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 507-519Google Scholar). These motifs are highly conserved both in sequence and spacing, and it has been shown that at least two (preferably adjacent) motifs are required for high affinity binding of SRC1 to Class I receptors (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 5Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of multiple LXXLL motifs in coactivators facilitates cooperative binding to the AF2 surfaces of NR dimers. The mammalian mediator complex TRAP/DRIP/SMCC/ARC/CRSP contains a single subunit capable of binding to NR LBDs (17Fondell J.D. Ge H. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This protein, termed TRAP220, DRIP205, or PBP, contains two LXXLL motifs within the NID that are required for ligand-dependent binding to NRs (19Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G.

The transcriptional repressor RIP140 contains nine functional LXXLL motifs (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar), and a similar number have been identified in the ERα-binding protein PELP1 (27Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Google Scholar). Several cofactors have been found to display preferences for NR subclasses. For example, TIP60 has been reported to bind the Class I receptors, but displayed little interaction with VDR, TR, or RXR (22Gaughan L. Brady M.E. Cook S. Neal D.E. Robson C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46841-46848Google Scholar). The p160s interact with a wide range of NRs, although individual LXXLL motifs derived from these proteins display differential binding to NRs (14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H.

In addition, we have shown that LXXLL sequences derived from CBP and RIP140 show selectivity that is at least partly determined by the LXXLL core sequences (14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Google Scholar). Similarly, LXXLL motifs (or variants such as LXXIL and FXXLL) from other cofactors, such as PERC (31Kressler D. Schreiber S.N. Knutti D. Kralli A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13918-13925Google Scholar), NRIF3 (32Li D. Desai-Yajnik V. Lo E. Schapira M. Abagyan R. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3398-3412Google Scholar) have been reported to display selectivity in their interactions with NRs. TRAP220 was isolated on the basis of its interaction with Class II NRs such as TR, VDR, and PPARs, and it has been shown that ablation of either of its two LXXLL motifs had differential effects on binding to NRs. RXR binding was disrupted by mutation of LXM1, whereas TR, RAR, and VDR showed a preference for binding the distal motif, LXM2 (20Rachez C. Gamble M. Chang C.P. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Freedman L.P.

In this study we assessed the interaction of TRAP220 NID, LXXLL peptides, and full-length proteins with a panel of NR LBDs. We show that TRAP220 displays stronger interactions with certain Class II receptors in comparison to steroid receptors. We describe mutational analyses and mapping experiments that shed light on the molecular basis of the NR binding specificity of TRAP220. The following plasmids used in transient transfection experiments have been described previously: pSG5-SRC1e (16Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G.

Roeder. A cDNA-encoding full-length TRAP220 with an N-terminal HA tag was subcloned into the modified vector pSG5(PT) using uniqueXmaI and NotI sites. For yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, the p3ERE-lacZ reporter (46Metzger D. Losson R. Bornert J.M. Lemoine Y. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2813-2817Google Scholar), and vectors pBL1 and modified pASV3 (43Le Douarin B. Heery D.M. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar) expressing the human ERα DNA binding domain (DBD) and the VP16 acidic activation domain (AAD), respectively, were gifts from R. Losson and P. Chambon. The constructs AAD-AR-LBD-(625–919), AAD-PR-LBD-(633–933) (44Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Google Scholar), AAD-ERα-LBD-(282–595) (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar), AAD-RARα-LBD-(200–462), and AAD-RXRα-LBD-(230–467) (14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Google Scholar) have been described previously. The constructs AAD-PPARγ-LBD-(173–475) and AAD-TRβ-(1–456) were generated by cloning PCR fragments into the modified pASV3. The ER-DBD-LXXLL core motif fusion proteins including TRAP220 LXM1-(603–611) and TRAP220 LXM2-(644–652) and the TRAP220 LXM1 extended (600–612), were generated by ligation of phosphorylated, annealed oligonucleotide pairs into the pBL1 vector. ER-DBD-SRC1 LXM2 (formerly referred to as DBD-SRC1 motif 2) has been described previously (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). TRAP220 NID-(335–667) and SRC1 NID-(431–761) were produced by PCR and cloned into a modified pBTM116 vector generating LexA-TRAP220 NID and LexA-SRC1 NID, respectively. The LexA-TRAP220 NID-(335–667) mutants (A-H, spacer, mut1 and mut2) were generated using recombinant PCR techniques. All constructs generated by PCR were sequenced. The expression of fusion proteins in yeast was monitored by Western blotting using antibodies recognizing VP16, LexA (Autogen Bioclear), or the ERα F domain epitope tag at the N terminus of the ER-DBD fusion proteins, as described previously (43Le Douarin B. Heery D.M. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). For in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays, the control GST construct was a modified version of pGEX-2TK vector (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs GST-TRβ-LBD and GST-RXRα-LBD were gifts from K. Chatterjee and E. Kalkhoven, respectively. GST-ERα-LBD has been described previously (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar). pSG5(PT)-TRAP220 LXM1 mutant F was generated by replacing aXhoI/KpnI fragment of pSG5(PT)-TRAP220 with the corresponding fragment from pBTM116-TRAP220 NID mutant F. Maintenance of HeLa cells and transient transfection protocols were as described (45Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). The transfected DNA included pJ7-lacZ internal control plasmid (500 ng/well), p3ERE-TATA-LUC (1 μg), or pMAL-TK-LUC (2 μg) luciferase reporter plasmids, with either pMT-MOR (100 ng) or pRSV-TRβ (200 ng) expression vectors and varying amounts of pSG5-SRC1e or pSG5-TRAP220, as indicated. Empty pSG5 expression vector was used to standardize the amount of transfected DNA. The ligands used were 10−8m 17β-estradiol (E2 (for ERα)) and 10−7m 3,3′,5-triiodo-l-thyronine (T3) (for TRβ). Saccharomyces cerevisiae W303–1b (HMLα MATα HMRα his3–11, 15 trp1–1 ade2–1 can1–100 leu2–3, 11 ura3) was transformed sequentially with p3ERE-LacZ reporter plasmid, ER-DBD fusion protein expression plasmids and AAD-NR-LBD expression plasmids using the lithium acetate chemical transformation method (43Le Douarin B. Heery D.M. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). L40 (trp1 leu2 his3 ade2LYS2::(lexAop)4×-HIS3 URA3::(LexAop)8×-LacZ) was transformed sequentially with LexA-fusion protein expression vectors and AAD-NR-LBD expression vectors using electroporation (43Le Douarin B. Heery D.M. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar). Transformants containing the desired plasmids were selected on appropriate media and grown to late log phase in 15 ml of selective medium (yeast nitrogen base containing 2% w/v glucose and appropriate supplements) in the presence of 10−6mreceptor cognate ligand (E2, T3, promegestone (R5020), 9-cis-retinoic acid (9c-RA), all-trans-retinoic acid (AT-RA), rosiglitazone, mibolerone) or an equivalent amount of vehicle. Preparation of cell-free extracts was by the glass bead method and β-galactosidase assay of the extracts were performed as described (43Le Douarin B. Heery D.M. Gaudon C. vom Baur E. Losson R. Methods in Molecular Biology, Steroid Receptor Methods: Protocols and Assays. 176. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2001: 227-248Google Scholar, 46Metzger D. Losson R. Bornert J.M. Lemoine Y. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2813-2817Google Scholar). Reporter β-galactosidase activities in the presence or absence of ligand were determined for two transformants for each condition, in replicated experiments, as stated. Ligands were purchased from Sigma with the exception of rosiglitazone, which was a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline. Recombinant cDNAs in pSG5 or pSG5(PT) expression vectors were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α using isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction, purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and normalized amounts were incubated with 35S-radiolabeled protein in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mmdithiothreitol) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence or absence of 10−6m cognate ligand (E2, 9c-RA or T3), as described previously (16Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Google Scholar). Samples were washed three times, and bound proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Previous studies have shown that ectopic expression of the mammalian mediator complex protein TRAP220/DRIP205/PBP modestly enhances TRα/β, VDR, and PPARγ-mediated transcription in a ligand-dependent manner (19Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Google Scholar, 20Rachez C. Gamble M. Chang C.P. Atkins G.B. Lazar M.A. Freedman L.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2718-2726Google Scholar, 21Zhu Y. Qi C. Jain S. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25500-25506Google Scholar). We assessed the ability of TRAP220 to stimulate TRβ-mediated activation of the T3-responsive reporter gene, MAL-TK-LUC. This reporter contains a single thyroid response element (TRE) consisting of a direct repeat spaced by four nucleotides (DR4) within a thymidine kinase promoter and driving a firefly luciferase gene (41Collingwood T.N. Adams M. Tone Y. Chatterjee V.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1262-1277Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, increasing amounts of transiently transfected TRAP220 expression vector enhanced TRβ-mediated transcription of the MAL-TK-LUC reporter ∼2-fold in the presence of ligand. This is comparable to previously observed levels of TRAP220 enhancement of TRα-driven expression of T3-responsive reporters (19Yuan C.X. Ito M. Fondell J.D. Fu Z.Y. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7939-7944Google Scholar). Under similar conditions, the p160 nuclear receptor coactivator, SRC1e, also modestly enhanced TRβ activation of MAL-TK-LUC (Fig. 1 A). Co-expression with RXRα did not significantly increase the levels of reporter activity achieved in the presence or absence of coactivators (data not shown). We also assessed the ability of TRAP220 to enhance the activity of the Class I receptor ERα. As shown in Fig. 1 B, TRAP220 did not enhance ERα-mediated transcription of the 3ERE-TATA-LUC reporter gene (40Legler J. van den Brink C.E. Brouwer A. Murk A.J. van der Saag P.T. Vethaak A.D. van der Burg B. Toxicol. Sci. 1999; 48: 55-66Google Scholar), under similar transfection conditions to those used for TRβ. In contrast, co-transfection of SRC1e strongly enhanced ERα-mediated transcription both in the presence and absence of ligand, as reported previously (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 16Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Google Scholar, 44Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Google Scholar, 45Sheppard H.M. Harries J.C. Hussain S. Bevan C. Heery D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 39-50Google Scholar). The expression and nuclear localization of both TRAP220 and p160 coactivators in transiently transfected cells was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence using anti-HA antibodies (data not shown). The ability of TRAP220 to enhance transcription by TRβ but not ERα suggested that TRAP220 exhibits NR binding preferences. We therefore decided to compare the ability of SRC1 and TRAP220 NIDs to bind to a panel of NR LBDs in yeast two-hybrid experiments. Fusion proteins (shown schematically in Fig.2), consisting of the LexA-DNA binding domain (DBD) fused to amino acids 431–761 of SRC1 encompassing LXM1, LXM2, and LXM3 (SRC1 NID; Fig. 2 A), or amino acids 335–667 of TRAP220, encompassing LXM1 and LXM2 (TRAP220 NID; Fig.2 B), were assessed for binding to AAD-NR-LBD fusion proteins. Western blots using an antibody recognizing LexA confirmed that these constructs were expressed to similar levels in L40 (see Fig.6 B), and neither LexA-SRC1 NID nor LexA-TRAP220 NID was able to activate transcription of the reporter either alone or in the presence of VP16-AAD (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, strong ligand-dependent reporter activation was observed between SRC1 NID and the LBDs of the PR, ERα, RARα, RXRα, and full-length TRβ, (ranging from 80–160 units of reporter activity) and also a weaker but significant interaction with the AR LBD (25 units reporter activity). We also observed a significant binding to retinoid receptors in the absence of ligand (50 and 30 units of reporter activity for RARα and RXRα, respectively). The TRAP220 NID fusion protein also displayed strong ligand-dependent reporter activation when co-expressed with RXRα LBD, TRβ, and PPARγ LBD (140, 110 and 300 units of reporter activity respectively, Fig.2 B), and an intermediate level of reporter activation when co-expressed with RARα-LBD (40 units of reporter activity). Although no ligand-independent interactions were observed between TRAP220 NID and retinoid or thyroid receptors, the reporter activity indicated a strong interaction with PPARγ-LBD in the absence of exogenous ligand (120 units of reporter activity), consistent with our previous observation that yeast cells may contain endogenous ligands for PPARγ. 2V. H. Coulthard and D. Heery, unpublished results. In contrast to SRC1, the TRAP220 NID showed a greatly reduced ability to interact with Class I receptors, showing relatively weak ligand-dependent reporter activities when co-expressed with ERα LBD (20 units), PR LBD (3 units), and no detectable interaction with AR LBD. Thus, our results indicate that while the SRC1 NID interacts strongly with both steroid and Class II NRs, the TRAP220 NID shows a marked preference for binding to the Class II NRs such as TRβ, RXRα, and PPARγ.Figure 6Combinatorial effects of mutations in the extended LXM1 on the binding of the TRAP220 NID to ERα.

C, yeast two-hybrid experiment showing interaction of LexA-SRC1 NID and LexA-TRAP220 NID wt and mutant proteins with AAD-ERα as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether both LXXLL motifs of TRAP220 are required for binding the panel of LBDs used in this study, we generated LexA-TRAP220 NID constructs in which either LXM1 or LXM2 was mutated, by replacing the leucines +4 and +5 with alanines. As shown in Fig.2 C, interaction of the TRAP220 NID with TRβ and PPARγ LBD was dependent on the presence of two functional LXXLL motifs, as mutation of either motif resulted in a significant reduction in reporter activation. Similarly, the weak interaction with ERα LBD was abrogated by mutation of either LXM1 or LXM2, indicating a requirement for both motifs. In contrast, interaction of TRAP220 NID with RXRα LBD was severely reduced by mutation of LXM1 but largely unaffected by mutation of LXM2. This indicates that the RXRα LBD preferentially interacts with LXM1, consistent with a previous study that showed selective binding of RXRα LBD (albeit weak) to TRAP220 LXM1 in GST pull-down assays (28Ren Y. Behre E. Ren Z. Zhang J. Wang Q. Fondell J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5433-5446Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that 8–10 amino acid sequences encompassing the signature motif LXXLL are sufficient to bind to liganded NR LBDs, and this has been referred to as the core LXXLL motif (4Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Google Scholar, 14Heery D.M. Hoare S. Hussain S. Parker M.G. Sheppard H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6695-6702Google Scholar). To explore the nature of the specificity exhibited by the TRAP220 NID in more detail, we assessed the ability of LXXLL core motifs derived from SRC1 and TRA"
https://openalex.org/W2009142138,"CD45 is the major protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor on T cell surfaces that functions as both a positive and a negative regulator of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Although CD45 is required for the activation of TCR-associated Src family kinases, it also dephosphorylates phosphoproteins involved in the TCR-signaling cascade. This study links CD45 to the inhibitory activity of placental protein 14 (PP14), a major soluble protein of pregnancy that is now known to be a direct modulator of T cells and to function by desensitizing TCR signaling. PP14 and CD45 co-capped with each other, pointing to a physical linkage between the two. Interestingly, however, the binding of PP14 to T cell surfaces was not restricted to CD45 alone, with evidence showing that PP14 binds to other surface molecules in a carbohydrate-dependent fashion. Notwithstanding the broader molecular binding potential of PP14, its interaction with CD45 appeared to have special functional significance. Using transfected derivatives of the HPB.ALL mutant T cell line that differ in CD45 expression, we established that the inhibitory effects of PP14 are dependent upon the expression of intact CD45 on T cell surfaces. Based upon these findings, we propose a new immunoregulatory model for PP14, wherein one of its surface molecular targets, CD45, mediates its T cell inhibitory activity, accounting for the intriguing capacity of PP14 to elevate TCR activation thresholds and thereby down-regulate T cell activation.

Together, these various findings support a two-phase model for CD45 function wherein it is essential for T cell activation early on, but, subsequently, it is sequestered away from some of its tyrosine substrates within the antigen-presenting cell, T cell contact site, or immune synapse in order to enable sustained TCR signaling (10Thomas M.L.

T cell receptor antibody monoclonal Ab epidermal growth factor EGF receptor placental protein 14 amniotic fluid antigen-presenting cell CD45 exists in multiple isoforms, which arise through alternative mRNA splicing (21Ralph S.J.

Immunol. 1988; 141: 2781-2787PubMed Google Scholar). The CD45 cytoplasmic domain, which is shared among them, mediates the protein's phosphatase activity. This domain can be regulated by artificial means like, for example, using Ab directed against various extracellular CD45 epitopes (24Yakura H. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 14: 311-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or replacing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD45 with those of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and then stimulating the resulting chimeric protein with the cognate ligand, EGF (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although uncertainty continues to surround the precise identities and roles of the natural ligands of CD45, two especially interesting candidates have emerged. The human B cell adhesion molecule CD22, a sialic acid-binding lectin, binds to the CD45RO isoform (26Stamenkovic I. Sgroi D. Aruffo A. Sy M.S. Anderson T. Cell. 1991; 66: 1133-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) and modulates early TCR signaling through ligation of the CD45 extracellular domain (27Sgroi D. Koretzky G.A. Stamenkovic I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4026-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Galectin-1, another lectin, also binds to CD45 and, in so doing, induces apoptosis of Jurkat T cells (28Perillo N.L. Pace K.E. Seilhamer J.J. Baum L.G. Nature. 1995; 378: 736-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 29Walzel H. Schulz U. Neels P. Brock J. Immunol. Lett. 1999; 67: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 30Pace K.E.

Interestingly, both CD22 and galectin-1, as lectins, bind to multiple other non-CD45 glycoproteins as well. Placental protein 14 (PP14; progesterone-associated endometrial protein; glycodelin) is a 28-kDa glycoprotein of the lipocalin structural superfamily with documented immunoinhibitory properties (31Bolton A.E.

J. Obstet. Gynaecol. 1985; 92: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We have reported that PP14 directly inhibits human T cells and accounts for the T cell inhibitory activity of AF (37Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our findings further suggested that PP14 targets early events during TCR signal transduction (37Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), facilitates the dephosphorylation of TCR-induced phosphoproteins, (38Rachmilewitz J. Borovsky Z. Mishan-Eisenberg G. Yaniv E. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and has the intriguing capacity to elevate TCR activation thresholds (39Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Huang J.H. Chen A. Tykocinski M.L. Blood. 2001; 98: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This latter finding points to an unusual immunoregulatory mechanism for PP14 that is distinct from that of other better characterized T cell suppressive factors (such as cyclosporin A). Considering the possibility that CD45 might explain, at least in part, the effects of PP14 on the dephosphorylation of TCR-induced phosphoproteins and TCR activation thresholds, we proposed a connection between PP14 and CD45. Our data now establish the existence of both physical and functional links between the two, with a clear demonstration that CD45 is required for PP14-mediated immunoinhibition. Furthermore, this study offers an unexpected insight into the nature of PP14 binding to T cells, suggesting that PP14 does not interact with a single discrete surface receptor on T cells but rather with multiple surface molecules in a lectin-like fashion. Among these receptors, the abundant CD45 molecule appears to be, at least from the immunological standpoint, one of the most functionally significant targets of PP14. In this context, an interesting parallel emerges between PP14 and the lectins CD22 and galectin-1, whose immunoregulatory activities have been similarly linked to CD45. Based on our findings and the galectin-1 parallel in particular, we propose a T cell regulation model wherein PP14 interferes with the usual post-triggering sequestration of the CD45 phosphatase away from its critical substrates and thereby attenuates TCR signaling via an alteration of the local balance between tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were purified from the venous blood of healthy donors by density gradient centrifugation, as described (37Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells were isolated from the PBMC pool by first depleting monocytes via adherence to tissue culture flasks and then further purifying the non-adherent T cells with a magnetic cell isolation system (Milteny Biotec, Bergisch, Germany). The cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel) and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Biological Industries), 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin/ streptomycin. The Jurkat and the derivative J45 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Cell Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in the above medium. H45L13 and H45XL2 transfectants were provided by Dr. A. Weiss (University of California, San Francisco, CA) and maintained in the above medium supplemented with 2 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Discarded human AF samples were obtained from the Center for Human Genetics Laboratory at Hadassah Hospital and stored at −80 °C. Samples obtained from several patients (collected at 14–16 weeks of gestation) were pooled and filter sterilized before use. Anti-PP14 polyclonal Abs (34Morrow D.M. Xiong N. Getty R.R. Ratajczak M.Z.

Pathol. 1994; 145: 1485-1495PubMed Google Scholar) were coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) to generate an immunoabsorbent. Immunoabsorption was carried out by adding AF to Ab-coupled beads and incubating the mixture overnight at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered and used in assays as described. The presence of PP14 was verified by Western blotting. The coding sequence for full-length human PP14 (34Morrow D.M. Xiong N. Getty R.R. Ratajczak M.Z. Morgan D. Seppala M. Riittinen L. Gewirtz A.M. Tykocinski M.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 1485-1495PubMed Google Scholar), including its signal sequence, was fused in-frame to the coding sequences for the hinge, i.e.the CH1 and CH2 domains of human IgG1. This chimeric sequence was inserted into the Epstein-Barr virus episomal expression vector pIgG/REP7β (40Brunschwig E.B. Levine E. Trefzer U. Tykocinski M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5498-5505PubMed Google Scholar), generating pPP14·Fcγ1/REP7β. Stable 293 cell (ATCC) transfectants secreting PP14·Fcγ1 were grown in Ultraculture (Whittaker Bioproducts, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with hygromycin B (200 μg/ml; Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. To purify the protein, conditioned media were mixed with an equal volume of binding buffer (3.0 m sodium chloride/1.5 m glycine, pH 8.6). Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was added, and the suspension was mixed overnight at 4 °C. The matrix was collected and washed with 10-column volumes of 100 mm Tris/150 mm NaCl, pH 9.0. PP14·Fcγ1 was eluted with 100 mm Tris/150 mm NaCl, pH 12.0 into 1.4 volumes of 300 mmcitric acid, pH 6.0. The purified protein was concentrated and buffer exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline using Centricon-10 filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Co-localization of PP14 and CD45 was assessed in co-capping experiments. CD4+ T cells were incubated with either 2 μg/ml PP14·Fcγ1or 2 μg/ml CTLA-4·Fcγ1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml F(ab)2fragment goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). The cells were then fixed with methanol and, following rehydration, CD45 was detected with pan-specific anti-CD45 mAb (GAP8.3; ATCC) and Alexa-488-conjugated F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes); PP14·Fcγ1 was detected using Cy5-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Control cells (labeled with Alexa-488- or Cy5-conjugated Ab alone) were always prepared simultaneously for each experiment. Images were obtained using an LSM confocal laser scanning system attached to a Zeiss Axiovert 135M inverted microscope with a 100/1.3 plan-Neofluor lens. Cells were scanned by dual excitation of Alexa-488 (green) and Cy5 (red) fluorescence, with green and red overlapping fluorescence detected as a yellow signal. T cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml of either PP14·Fcγ1 or CTLA-4·Fcγ1 (R&D Systems) for 30 min at 37 °C, and the cells were then methanol fixed. After rehydration, the fixed cells were labeled with phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated F(ab)2 fragment goat anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). 1 × 104 cells per sample were analyzed on a FACScalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest software. Each cell type was loaded with 3 mm Indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells (3 × 106 per ml) were stimulated with anti-CD3 mAb (OKT3; 1:1000 dilution of ascites) at 37 °C. Fluorescence emission was measured by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). H45L13 and H45XL2 cells were stimulated for 48 h with anti-CD3 mAb immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads in combination with soluble anti-CD28 mAb in the absence or presence of either AF or PP14·Fcγ1. CD69 and CD40L expression were measured by direct immunofluorescence using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD69 and anti-CD40L mAb (Pharmingen), respectively, and the immunostained cells (1 × 104cells/sample) were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) using Cell Quest software. The data were calculated as the percentage of positive cells in the cell populations. Costimulation through T cell surface CD28 increases the stability of phosphorylated proteins (41Viola A. Schroeder S. Sakakibara Y. Lanzavecchia A. Science. 1999; 283: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), thereby amplifying TCR signaling and facilitating T cell activation. In light of our findings that B7-1-driven, CD28-mediated costimulation counteracts PP14 inhibition (39Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Huang J.H. Chen A. Tykocinski M.L. Blood. 2001; 98: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and that PP14 promotes the dephosphorylation of TCR-induced phosphotyrosines (38Rachmilewitz J. Borovsky Z. Mishan-Eisenberg G. Yaniv E. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that PP14 may function by promoting the activity of one or more protein tyrosine phosphatases. CD45 was a transmembrane protein tyrosine phosphatase of special interest in this regard, given that it contributes up to 80% of the tyrosine phosphatase activity in T cell membranes (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). As a first step, we performed fluorescence co-capping experiments to look for CD45 surface aggregation in response to the cross-linking of bound PP14·Fcγ1. Purified CD4+ T cells were sequentially treated with PP14·Fcγ1 followed by goat anti-human Ig as a cross-linking agent, and, in turn, CD45 epitopes were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, using anti-CD45 mAb as primary Ab. Representative co-capping data are shown in Fig. 1. Whereas CD45 was uniformly distributed over the surfaces of T cells not exposed to Fcγ1 fusion proteins and cross-linking Ab, it segregated into large aggregates, co-localizing with PP14 epitopes on T cells pre-treated with the PP14·Fcγ1/cross-linking Ab combination. Because an irrelevant Fcγ1 fusion protein control, CTLA-4·Fcγ1, was substituted for PP14·Fcγ1 in this instance, an aggregation of surface-associated CTLA-4·Fcγ1 (presumably bound via Fc receptors) could be visualized (albeit requiring a significantly higher red fluorescence gain for detection than that used for PP14·Fcγ1), but, importantly, no co-aggregation of CD45 was evident. Thus, the co-capping approach provided evidence for an association between CD45 and PP14 at the T cell surface, although we do not rule out the possibility of an indirect association between the two. Following up on these co-capping data, we turned to flow cytometry as a more quantitative tool for tracking PP14 binding events. First, we documented PP14·Fcγ1 binding to purified CD4+ T cells using phosphatidylethanolamine-conjugated anti-human Ig as a detecting reagent (Fig.2A). PP14·Fcγ1binding was substantially greater than that for CTLA-4·Fcγ1, which served as a negative control for nonspecific receptor-dependent Fcγ1 binding. The specificity of this binding was established by further showing that it could be competitively blocked by pre-incubating the cells with AF, used as a rich source of native PP14 (Fig. 2A). Building upon this ability to visualize bound PP14·Fcγ1by flow cytometry, we next compared the binding of PP14·Fcγ1 to Jurkat T cells, which endogenously express CD45, and J45, a CD45-deficient derivative cell line. Substantial binding of PP14·Fcγ1 (as compared with CTLA-4·Fcγ1) to Jurkat cells was readily detected (Fig.2B, top left panel). Surprisingly, there was comparable binding of PP14·Fcγ1to the J45-derivative cells (Fig. 2B, top right panel), despite the cells expressing substantially lower levels of surface CD45 (Fig. 2B,bottom panels). As was the case with purified CD4+ T cells, pre-incubating either of the cell lines with AF competitively blocked the binding of PP14·Fcγ1. 2J. Rachmilewitz and Z. Borovsky, unpublished data. Similar results were obtained when radiolabeled125I-PP14·Fcγ1 was used as a more sensitive probe, with comparable binding to both Jurkat and J45 cells (Fig.2C). Because no chemical cross-linking was required for detecting bound PP14·Fcγ1, this sensitive experimental approach additionally served to rule out any artifacts that could arise from chemical cross-linking. Thus, PP14 clearly binds to more than CD45. We further confirmed these results by comparing the binding of PP14·Fcγ1 to the HPB.ALL T cell line and its derivative H45, which were used as true CD45-negative cells (Fig. 2D). Once more, similar levels of bound PP14·Fcγ1 were detected in HPB.ALL and H45 cells (Fig. 2D,top panel) despite the absence of CD45 expression in the latter (Fig. 2D, bottom panel). The observation that PP14 binds to more than CD45 on T cell surfaces suggested a parallel to two other immunomodulatory proteins, CD22 and galectin-1, that mediate their functional effects through CD45, and, additionally, as lectins, bind to multiple surface glycoproteins. Therefore, we asked whether PP14 binding to T cell surfaces may be similarly dependent upon carbohydrate interactions. To this end, we tested the ability of several free carbohydrates to competitively block the interaction of PP14·Fcγ1 with T cells. The addition of 1 mg/ml asialofetuin, which contains terminal non-reducing Gal residues (42Townsend R.R. Hardy M.R. Wong T.C. Lee Y.C. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5716-5725Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), abrogated PP14·Fcγ1 binding to T cells (Fig. 3) as well as to J45 and H45 cell lines that are deficient in CD45 expression.2 In contrast, lactose and cellobiose (Glcβ1-4Glc) (which is identical to lactose except for the equatorial orientation of the 4-hydroxyl groups on the non-reducing Glc), both at a concentration of 60 mm, had substantially less effect on the binding of PP14·Fcγ1 to T cells (Fig. 3). This competitive inhibition with free carbohydrates is consistent with a carbohydrate-dependent interaction between PP14 and various glycoproteins at the cell surface, including CD45. With evidence in hand that PP14 binds to both CD45 and other non-CD45 cell surface molecules, we next turned to function, assessing whether CD45 has a special role in mediating the T cell inhibitory activities of PP14. Although CD45 is usually thought of in terms of its contributions to initial events in T cell activation, some have suggested, based upon its phosphatase activity and expected steric effects, that sustained co-localization of CD45 with the TCR complex may in fact be inhibitory to TCR signal transduction (20Shaw A.S. Dustin M.L. Immunity. 1997; 6: 361-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Supporting this idea is the finding that Ab-mediated co-cross-linking of CD45 and TCR suppresses receptor signaling and T cell activation (11Turka L.A. Kanner S.B. Schieven G.L. Thompson C.B. Ledbetter J.A. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 551-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 12Ledbetter J.A. Schieven G.L. Uckun F.M. Imboden J.B. J.

Furthermore, because the extracellular and transmembrane domains of CD45 are known to regulate the phosphatase activity of its intracellular domain (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the former two CD45 domains might play a role in PP14-mediated inhibition of TCR signaling. To test this hypothesis, we employed two transfected derivatives of the CD45-deficient HPB.ALL mutant T cell line, i.e. H45L13 (expressing wild-type CD45) and H45XL2 (expressing a recombinant EGFR·CD45 fusion protein composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR and the CD45 intracellular domain) (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This paired set of H45L13/H45XL2 transfectants has been used previously to demonstrate that a chimeric EGFR·CD45 retains the capacity of intact CD45 to restore TCR-mediated signaling in CD45-deficient cells (25Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). We first examined the differential effects of PP14 on calcium fluxes for this cellular pair. TCR stimulation induces protein tyrosine kinase activity followed by an increase in intracellular free calcium, both of which are dependent upon the surface expression of CD45 (43Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,44Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). TCR stimulation of both transfectants with anti-CD3 mAb resulted in an increase in intracellular free calcium (Fig.4A). Whereas anti-CD45 mAb (GAP8.3) treatment inhibited calcium flux in anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated H45L13, it did not do so in anti-CD3 mAb-stimulated H45XL2 (EGFR:CD45) cells,2 validating the experimental procedure. Significantly, the addition of AF (used as an abundant source of PP14) to H45L13 cells (expressing the wild-type CD45) substantially inhibited TCR-induced calcium mobilization. In contrast, there was only a minor decrease in the calcium response of H45XL2 cells (expressing the EGFR·CD45 chimeric protein) despite the fact that the concentration of AF used (50%) was significantly higher than that required for the inhibition of T cell function (10–25%) (Fig. 4A). Of note, we have demonstrated previously that the immunoinhibitory activities of AF are attributable to PP14 (37Rachmilewitz J. Riely G.J. Tykocinski M.L. Cell. Immunol. 1999; 191: 26-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In accord with these findings, AF that was immunodepleted of its PP14 demonstrated a significantly reduced capacity to inhibit calcium fluxes (Fig. 4A). The minor inhibitory activity that is still observed in this experiment can be attributed to the residual amounts of PP14 present in the immuno-deplete"

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4779-4788Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Direct interactions of these basic residues with negatively charged groups of heparin are observed in the crystal structure of an ATIII-pentasaccharide complex (13Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R.

Studies of heparin binding kinetics indicate that Lys-125 is the most important amino acid in the initial docking with heparin and that Arg-129, Lys-114, and Arg-47 are critical for the protein conformational change step leading to the high affinity, activated AT*H complex. Heparin binding leads to elongation of ATIII helix D by 1.5 turns at its carboxyl-terminal end as well as the formation of a new alpha helix, the P-helix, at its amino-terminal end (13Jin L.

These structural changes are associated with expulsion of the P14 residue from central beta sheet A and increased reactivity with factor Xa (15vanBoeckel C. Grootenhuis P. Visser A. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8495-8503Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Protein-heparin interactions are comprised of ionic and non-ionic components whose energies and relative strengths can be measured using polyelectrolyte theory. For example, in the case of thrombin, 86% of the free energy of heparin binding results from ionic interactions, whereas 14% derives from non-ionic interactions (17Olson S. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, for brain natriuretic peptide, non-ionic interactions contribute 94% of the heparin binding energy and only 6% is from ionic interactions (18Hileman R. Jennings R. Linhardt R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15231-15237Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antithrombin III heparin binding involves five to six ionic interactions that contribute only 40% of the binding energy (2Olson S.T. Bjork I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Olson S. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6353-6364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S. Olson S. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Non-ionic interactions are responsible for the remaining 60% of the binding energy. Although non-ionic interactions contribute more to the strength of ATIII heparin binding than do ionic interactions, work to date has focused mostly on arginines and lysines of the heparin binding site and ignored potentially important non-polar residues.The present study was designed to address the roles of ATIII phenylalanines 121 and 122 (Phe-121 and Phe-122) in heparin binding and activation. Phe-121 and Phe-122 were selected for investigation based on their proximity to positively charged residues of the pentasaccharide binding site and because, although not conserved across different branches of the serpin family, these phenylalanines are conserved in antithrombins from different vertebrate species (20Backovic M. Gettins P. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which also conserve the capacity for heparin binding and activation (21Jordan R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 227: 587-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The results of our work demonstrate that, although phenylalanines 121 and 122 make minimal direct contact with heparin, they nevertheless contribute significantly to antithrombin affinity for its cofactor and are responsible for 43% of the total binding energy and 77% of the free energy of non-ionic interactions. An F121A substitution decreased antithrombin affinity for heparin 13-fold, and an F122L substitution reduced heparin affinity >2000-fold through exclusively non-ionic effects. The large decrease in F122L affinity was due to a moderate decrease in the forward rate of the activating conformational change and greatly reduced stability of the AT*H complex. Binding equilibrium and kinetic data collected during the course of this work and information from the structure of an antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex also together suggest that Phe-122 and Lys-114 function cooperatively to coordinate the P-helix-mediated activating conformational change and to organize an extensive network of ionic and non-ionic interactions between positively charged antithrombin residues and heparin.DISCUSSIONAs illustrated in Fig. 3, phenylalanines 121 and 122 are located below the pentasaccharide and in the center of a cluster of positively charged residues (Arg-47, Lys-114, Lys-125, and Arg-129) known to participate in heparin binding (9Arocas V. Bock S. Olson S. Bjork I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10196-10204Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Desai U. Swanson R. Bock S. Bjork I. Olson S. J. Biol.

To investigate the roles of Phe-121 and Phe-122 in heparin binding and activation of ATIII, we made F121A and F122L substitution mutants on a β-antithrombin-like N135A background. F121A/N135A and F122L/N135A association rates for inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa in the absence and presence of full-length heparin and pentasaccharide were similar to control, and SDS-stable inhibitory complexes with target enzymes formed, indicating proper folding and function with respect to proteinase inhibition. However, the mutants displayed distinct heparin binding and activation defects. F121A/N135A exhibited a 13-fold decrease and F122L/N135A exhibited a >2000-fold decrease in affinity for full-length heparin. In both cases, reduced binding was entirely due to the loss of non-ionic interactions (hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions), whereas the number of ionic interactions remained unchanged. For binding of full-length heparin to F122L/N135A under physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength, formation of the weak AT-H intermediate in the two-step-induced fit mechanism for heparin activation of ATIII occurs normally, as indicated by its normal K 1. However, a moderate reduction in the value of k +2 and a large increase in the value of k −2 revealed that the >2000-fold loss of binding affinity results from a ∼20-fold reduction in the rate of the AT-H to AT*H conformational transition coupled with a >200-fold decrease in stability of the activated AT*H complex. The effects of the Phe-122 mutation on pentasaccharide binding are comparable to its effects on the binding of full-length heparin; however, in addition a slight decrease in the affinity of the first binding step is apparent for the pentasaccharide.The findings of our work on the functional contributions of phenylalanines 121 and 122 to antithrombin heparin binding and activation were evaluated from a structural point-of-view using high resolution x-ray structures for human plasma α antithrombin bound (pdb.1E03) and not bound (pdb.1E05) to pentasaccharide. From this analysis, we have identified a series of Phe-121- and Phe-122-mediated non-ionic interactions that appear to make significant contributions to the strength of ATIII-heparin binding. The structural analysis also revealed several Phe-121- and Phe-122-helix P interactions that appear to be critical for the conformational activation step and stabilization of the high affinity AT*H complex, which were defective in the kinetic studies of the F122L/N135A mutant.Phe-121 and Phe-122 Contributions to the Non-ionic Component of ATIII Heparin BindingFig. 3 shows that the most direct interaction between Phe-122 and the pentasaccharide involves the CZ of its phenylalanine side chain and the 3-O-sulfate on sugar F. Considering that extensive direct, non-ionic interactions between Phe-122 and the pentasaccharide are not observed in the co-crystal structure, it is paradoxical that the large loss of heparin binding affinity measured for the F122L mutant should be entirely accounted for by the loss of non-ionic interactions between ATIII and heparin (Table II). This disparity between the functional data and first inspection of the crystal structure can be resolved by hypothesizing that heparin makes non-ionic interactions with ATIII that do not directly involve the Phe-122 residue but are Phe-122-dependent.Further examination of the co-crystal structure (Fig. 3) reveals that the distal carbons of the Phe-122 phenyl ring form van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions with the hydrocarbon stems of the Arg-47 and Lys-114 side chains, positioning their respective terminal guanidinium and amino groups for multiple ionic and hydrogen bond interactions with the pentasaccharide. Measurements of the packing of the Phe-122 phenyl ring against the alkyl side chains of Arg-47 and Lys-114 in the ATIII-pentasaccharide complex are presented in Table V. TableVI lists measurements for specific ionic and non-ionic interactions formed between the pentasaccharide and the Arg-47 guanidinium side chain or Lys-114 epsilon amino group as a result of their positioning by the hydrophobic interactions between Phe-122 and Arg-47 and between Phe-122 and Lys-114 described in Table V. The overall conclusion from the information in Fig. 3 and Tables V and VI is that non-ionic interactions between Phe-122 and the proximal stems of the Arg-47 and Lys-114 side chains lead to extensive and specific contacts of their distal charged groups and the pentasaccharide. In the case of Arg-47, the guanidinium position specified by the interaction of its stem and the Phe-122 phenyl ring leads to four ionic and two non-ionic interactions involving the F, G, and H sugars of the pentasaccharide (see Fig. 3 and the right side of Table VI). In the case of the Lys-114 side chain, three different ionic interactions and five different non-ionic interactions with the pentasaccharide form as the result of the epsilon amino position specified by interactions of Phe-122 with Lys-114 CD and CE. The ionic and non-ionic interactions of Lys-114 with the cofactor are distributed over the pentasaccharide F, G, and H sugars, as shown in Fig. 3 and on the left side of Table VI.Table VPacking of Phe-122 against Arg-47 and Lys-114InteractionDistanceÅF122_CD1 - R47_CB4.3F122_CE1 - R47_CG4.6F122_CZ - R47_CD3.5F122_CE2 - K114_CD4.3F122_CZ - K114_CE4.7Van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts of Phe-122 atoms with Arg-47 and Lys-114 atoms in the I-chain of antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex (pdb.1E03).

Open table in a new tab In the F122L variant the distal CZ, CE1, and CE2 carbons of the normally occurring phenylalanine side chain are missing. As shown in Table V, these are exactly the carbons that mediate van der Waals and hydrophobic bonding of Phe-122 with Lys-114 and Arg-47. In the absence of the intact Phe-122 phenyl ring, positioning of Arg-47 and Lys-114 to develop the full range of non-ionic interactions described in Table VI will occur less efficiently. Although the unchangedZ value of F122L/N135A indicates that the normal number of ionic interactions with the pentasaccharide form despite the substitution, the substantial Kd ′ increase suggests that the distal carbons of the phenylalanine ring are necessary for participating in affinity-augmenting hydrophobic/van der Waals interactions, and to precisely position the Lys-114 and Arg-47 epsilon amino and guanidinium groups for highly directional hydrogen bonding, which also contributes to the strength of the interaction. Thus, we propose that a substantial component of the >2000-fold loss in binding energy results from the reduced ability of the substituting leucine residue to specifically promote the ATIII-pentasaccharide van der Waals, hydrophobic, and hydrogen bond interactions listed in TableVI. With respect to Lys-114, affected interactions in the F122L/N135A mutant would include the hydrophobic interaction between the stem of the lysine and sugar H of the pentasaccharide, and a trifurcated hydrogen bond between its epsilon amino group and three sites on sugar G. For Arg-47, the bifurcated hydrogen bond between the Arg-47 guanidinium and two sulfates of the H sugar are disfavored in the F122L/N135A mutant.Van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions between the hydrocarbon stem of lysine 125 and the phenyl rings of Phe-121 and Phe-122 may also organize its epsilon amino group for favorable ionic and non-ionic hydrogen bond interactions with the D, E, and F sugars of the pentasaccharide. However, it is not possible to address this issue directly by inspection of the pdb.1E03 co-crystal structure due to the absence of density for the Lys-125 side chain distal to its β carbon (see Fig. 3). The low electron density may be due to population of more than one conformation in pentasaccharide-bound ATIII. This appears possible based on the position of the Lys-125 Cα and Cβ atoms, and the potential of its epsilon amino group to form hydrogen bond or ionic interactions with multiple polar atoms on the D, E, and F sugars and different van der Waals/hydrophobic interactions with Phe-121 and Phe-122. The 13-fold loss of binding affinity observed for F121A relative to its N135A parent may result from the loss of hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions between the ring of Phe-121 and proximal carbons of the Lys-125 side chain and/or the failure of the epsilon amino group to be optimally positioned to hydrogen bond with the pentasaccharide.Proposed Roles of Phe-121, Phe-122, the P-helix and Lys-114 in the Heparin-dependent Conformational Change and Stabilization of AT*HFig. 4 A shows that Phe-121 and Phe-122 are partially exposed to solvent in the native conformation of antithrombin (1E05.i, left panel) but shift to a more hydrophobic environment when heparin is bound (1E03.i,right panel). Burial of Phe-121 and Phe-122 is associated with movement of heparin binding site lysine and arginine residues (Fig. 4 B) to positions in which extensive and specific ionic and non-ionic interactions with the pentasaccharide develop, as discussed above and enumerated in Table VI. Fig.5 shows that Phe-121 and Phe-122 are located in the center of the helix D, helix A, helix P, and N-terminal polypeptide structural elements that rearrange during the protein conformational change associated with heparin binding and activation. In this central location, Phe-121 and Phe-122 are ideally situated to contribute to and to coordinate the conformational change leading to high affinity binding of heparin and increased reactivity of the reactive loop with target proteinases.Figure 4A, Phe-121 and Phe-122 are partially exposed to solvent in the native conformation of antithrombin but shift to a more hydrophobic environment when heparin is bound.Drawings show the surface of antithrombin III in the Phe-121/Phe-122 region of the heparin binding site as viewed from the solvent.

This conformation-dependent helix is called the P-helix (13Jin L. Abrahams J. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R. Carrell R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar), and it is not present in native antithrombin (see Fig. 5) (34Skinner R. Abrahams J. Whisstock J. Lesk A. Carrell R. Wardell M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Two naturally occurring mutants disrupt P-helix formation due to substitutions of serine 116 or glutamine 118 with the imino acid proline (35Okijama K. Abe H. Maeda S. Motomura M. Tsujihata M.

S116P and Q118P variant antithrombins exhibit heparin binding defects and cause thrombosis, suggesting that P-helix formation is important for heparin binding and for the physiological expression of antithrombin activity. Structural and kinetic considerations further suggest that P-helix formation is of central importance in the conformational change generating the high affinity activated AT*H complex and that Phe-122 and the key pentasaccharide binding residue lysine-114 act cooperatively in the formation of AT*H.Fig. 4 B and Table VII show that P-helix formation is accompanied by the development of close contacts between Phe-121/Phe-122 and P-helix residues, including Lys-114. In native ATIII, Phe-122 and Lys-114 are well separated (seearrow tails in Fig. 4 B). However, in the complex with pentasaccharide, these residues have moved near to each other (seearrowheads in Fig. 4 B), and the Phe-122 phenyl ring is in van der Waals/hydrophobic contact with the side chains of P-helix residues Lys-114 and Thr-115 (see Table VII). Similarly, Phe-121 and Gln-118 move into close contact with each other (4.0 Å, see Table VII) in the structure of the P-helix-containing pentasaccharide-bound complex. Thus, extensive contacts between Phe-122 and Lys-114 in the crystal structure of the ATIII-pentasaccharide complex, but not in the structure of native antithrombin, suggest that these residues act cooperatively to form the P-helix and to stabilize the activated AT*H complex. This hypothesis is supported by similar three order of magnitude increases in the values of k −2 (= k off) for F122L/N135A (Table III) and K114A/N135A (11Arocas V. Bock S. Raja S. Olson S. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43809-43817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Therefore, based on the structural and kinetic considerations reviewed above, we propose that Phe-122 and Lys-114 act cooperatively through non-ionic interactions to promote ATIII binding to the pentasaccharide via a P-helix-mediated protein conformational change mechanism that promotes the formation and stabilization of the activated, high affinity AT*H complex.Table VIIPhe-121 and Phe-122-P helix contactsP helix amino acidDistanceÅF122_CD2T115_CG23.6F122_CE2K114_CD4.3F122_CZK114_CE4.7F121_CBQ118_CB4.0Distances between indicated atoms of Phe-121 and Phe-122 and P helix atoms were measured in the I-chain of the ATIII-pentasaccharide complex (pdb.1E03). Open table in a new tab ConclusionThis work establishes the importance of hydrophobic residues Phe-121 and Phe-122 for heparin binding and shows that, under physiological conditions of pH and ionic strength, Phe-122 is critical for inducing a normal rate of conformational change and stabilizing the activated heparin-ATIII complex, AT*H. The rich network of contacts between Phe-122, Lys-114, and the pentasaccharide and P-helix may explain why high affinity binding to heparin and the protein conformational change leading to ATIII activation are intimately linked processes. In addition to aligning Lys-114 and Arg-47 to make the extensive ionic, hydrogen bond, and hydrophobic interactions with the pentasaccharide, Phe-122 and Lys-114 act cooperatively in the formation and stabilization of the P-helix, which promotes high affinity binding to heparin and may also be a key element in propagating the protein conformational change that increases reactive loop reactivity with target enzymes. The sulfated polysaccharide heparin functions as an anticoagulant by binding to antithrombin III (ATIII)1 and greatly accelerating its rates of thrombin and factor Xa inhibition. Heparin binding to ATIII is a two-step process consisting of an initial weak interaction that induces a protein conformational change leading to the formation of a high affinity binary complex with the cofactor (AT*H) and ATIII activation (1Olson S.

These holoproteins undergo rapid maturation by presenilinase mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to the production of N- and C-terminal fragments. We show first that overexpression of the presenilinase-derived maturation product of presenilin 2 (CTF-PS2) increases Aॆ recovery, the production of which is almost abolished by a caspase 3 inhibitor and increased by staurosporine. This and the observation that the apoptotic inducer staurosporine enhances CTF-PS2 degradation clearly link CTF-PS2 to apoptotic cascade effectors. This prompted us to analyze the putative ability of CTF-PS2 to modulate cell death. CTF-PS2 overexpression decreases cell viability and augments both caspase 3 activity and immunoreactivity. This is accompanied by loweredbcl2-like immunoreactivity and increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and cytochromec translocation into the cytosol. Interestingly, CTF-PS2-induced caspase 3 activation is prevented by pifithrin-α, a selective blocker of p53 transcriptional activity. On line with the latter data, CTF-PS2 drastically increases p53 immunoreactivity and transcriptional activity. Of most interest is our observation that CTF-PS2 expression also triggers increased caspase 3 activity and immunoreactivity in fibroblasts in which presenilins had been deleted. Therefore, CTF-PS2 could modulate cell death out of the NTF/CTF heterodimeric complex thought to correspond to the biologically functional entity. This is the first direct demonstration that CTF-PS2 could exhibit some of its functions in the absence of the presenilin 2 N-terminal fragment (NTF-PS2) counterpart derived from the presenilinase cleavage.

This is the first direct demonstration that CTF-PS2 could exhibit some of its functions in the absence of the presenilin 2 N-terminal fragment (NTF-PS2) counterpart derived from the presenilinase cleavage. presenilin C-terminal fragment poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase human embryonic kidney cells N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl] glycine terminal dUTP nick-end labeling acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1 and PS2)1 have been the center of a huge amount of studies because most of the familial forms of Alzheimer's disease are due to inherited mutations on genes coding for these two parent proteins (for reviews, see Refs. 1Van Broeckhoven C.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 181-184Google Scholar). PS1 and PS2 are highly homologous transmembrane proteins mainly located in the early compartments of the secretory pathway where they undergo various post-transcriptional modifications (5Suh Y.-H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Google Scholar). Particularly interesting is the susceptibility of PS to an endoproteolytic cleavage, giving rise to N-terminal and C-terminal (CTF) fragments (6Ward R.V. Davis J.B. Gray C.W. Barton A.J.L.

This proteolytic event appears of major importance because intact PS holoproteins are poorly detectable in the brain of affected patients. The two proteolytic counterparts appear to accumulate with a 1/1 stoichiometry (7Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar), and this complex is thought to exhibit the PS-mediated phenotypes. Among other biological functions, PSs have been shown to control the production of the amyloid ॆ-peptides and to modulate cell death in response to various apoptotic stimuli (10Mattson M.P. Guo Q. Furukawa K. Pedersen W.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1-14Google Scholar, 11Checler F. IUBMB Life. 1999; 48: 33-39Google Scholar). Interestingly, these two functions are altered by Alzheimer's disease-related pathogenic mutations. Thus, all mutations increase the production of amyloid ॆ-peptides (12Selkoe D.J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 741-766Google Scholar) and, more specifically, the 42-amino-acid-long Aॆ that appears to be more implicated in the pathology than its shorter counterpart of 40 residues. More recently, we showed that wild type PS2 and, more potently, mutated PS2, trigger caspase 3 activation by a p53-dependent mechanism (13Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Google Scholar). This was accompanied by a decrease in PS1 expression, in agreement with a previous report showing that p53 depletion increases PS1 expression and delayed apoptotic cell death (14Roperch J.-P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tyunder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.-C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 835-838Google Scholar). Interestingly, the presenilinase-derived CTF fragment undergoes phosphorylation events (15Seeger M. Nordstedt C. Petanceska S. Kovacs D.M. Gouras G.K. Hahne S. Fraser P. Levesque L. Czernik A.J. St-George-Hyslop P. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Tanzi R.E. Greengard P. Gandy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5090-5094Google Scholar, 16Walter J. Capell A. Grünberg J. Pesold B. Schindzielorz A. Prior R. Podlisny M.B. Fraser P. St. George Hyslop P. Selkoe D.J. Haass C. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 673-691Google Scholar) that appear to affect its susceptibility to caspase-mediated proteolysis (17Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Brockhaus M. Reinhard D. Nelboeck P. Mous J. Grünberg J. Haass C. Jacobsen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20655-20659Google Scholar, 18Kim T.-W. Pettingell W.H. Jung Y.-K. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1997; 277: 373-376Google Scholar, 19Grünberg J. Walter J. Loetscher H. Deuschle U. Jacobsen H. Haass C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2263-2270Google Scholar). This could suggest that at least part of the PS-associated modulation of cell death could be related to the production of the CTF or its caspase-derived fragment referred to as CTFcas. Therefore, two main questions at least remained to be addressed. First, what are the mechanisms by which the CTF fragment could modulate the apoptotic cell death? Second, is CTF acting through the interaction of its N-terminal counterpart, or is it able to trigger a phenotype in absence of N-terminal fragments? Here we establish that the overexpression of CTF-PS2 augments Aॆ, the production of which is prevented by caspase 3 inhibitors. Furthermore, CTF-PS2 increases caspase 3 expression and activity and elevates both expression and transcriptional activity of p53. Of most interest, we show that this CTF-PS2-related phenotype was still observed in PS-deficient cells, indicating that CTF-PS2 could be biologically active per se in the absence of any heterodimeric interaction with its N-terminal counterpart. HEK293 cells stably expressing the C-terminal fragment of PS2 (CTF-PS2) were obtained and cultured as previously described (20Marambaud P. Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 134-138Google Scholar). Mice in which the genes of PS1 and PS2 were deleted (kindly provided by Drs. Bart De Strooper (Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium) and Paul Saftig (Christian Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany)) have been previously described (21Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 461-462Google Scholar). Mice fibroblasts were obtained and immortalized with SV40 large T antigen according to the procedure previously reported (22De Strooper B. Annaert W. Cupers P. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Schrijvers V. Wolfe M.S. Ray W.J. Goate A. Kopan R. Nature. 1999; 398: 518-522Google Scholar) and cultured as previously reported (23Armogida M. Petit A. Vincent B. Scarzello S. Alves da Costa C. Checler F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1030-1033Google Scholar). Transient transfection of fibroblasts with the cDNA encoding either for CTF-PS2 or empty vector was performed with DAC30 according to manufacturer's recommendations (Eurogentec, France). CTF-PS2 expression in stably and transiently transfected cells was checked by Western blot by means of the Ab333 antibodies (rabbit polyclonal anti-C-terminal fragment of PS2 (provided by W. Araki and T. Tabira) as previously described (24Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 160-168Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 ॖm staurosporine. Cells were harvested, pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, gently resuspended in 500 ॖl of 0.17 sodium citrate buffer containing 50 ॖg/ml propidium iodide, and incubated overnight under agitation. The propidium iodide fluorescence of individual nuclei was measured using a FACScan flow cytometer (program CellQuest, BD Biosciences) as described (13Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 6-well plates and then treated or not with 2 ॖm staurosporine for 24 h. After treatment cells were fixed for 30 min with 47 paraformaldehyde, rinsed in PBS, permeabilized overnight with 707 ethanol, and then processed for the dUTP nick-end labeling TUNEL technique according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Staining was assessed with peroxidase-conjugated antibody and revealed with a diaminobenzidine substrate as described (25Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Vincent B. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50980-50984Google Scholar). Fragmented DNA labeling corresponds to black spots. A second labeling with erythrosin B was carried to visualize the totality of the cells. HEK293 cells were cultured in 6-well plates and then incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2.0 ॖm staurosporine (Sigma). In some cases cells were either preincubated overnight with 100 ॖmAc-DEVD-al (caspase 3 inhibitor, Neosystem) before treatment with staurosporine or submitted to a co-incubation of 2 ॖmstaurosporine and 10 ॖm p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α. Cells were then analyzed as extensively described (26Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24065-24069Google Scholar). Fluorimetry was recorded at 360 and 460 nm for excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively, by means of a microtiter plate reader (Labsystems Floroskan II). Caspase-specific activity was calculated from the linear part of fluorimetry recording and expressed in units/h/mg of proteins (established by the Bio-Rad procedure). One unit corresponds to 4 nmol of amidomethylcoumarin released. Plated cells were rinsed, gently scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended in 100 ॖl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 27 SDS and a mixture of protease inhibitors, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Equal amounts of protein (50 ॖg) were separated on 8 and 127 SDS-PAGE gels for analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and active caspase 3, Bcl2, caspase 3 precursor (ProCPP32), and p53, respectively, and wet-transferred to Hybond C (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. Membranes were then blocked with nonfat milk and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: anti-PARP (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-active caspase 3 (rabbit polyclonal, R&D Systems), anti-Bcl2 (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz), anti-ProCCP32 (mouse monoclonal, Transduction Laboratories), and an anti-p53 (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz). Immunological complexes were revealed by enhanced electrochemiluminescence (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with either an anti-rabbit peroxidase or with an anti-mouse peroxidase (Immunotech) antibodies depending on the host used for the production of the primary antibodies listed above. HEK293 cells were grown in 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2.0 ॖm staurosporine. Cells were submitted to a cellular fractionating, and the cytosolic/mitochondrial fractions were electrophoresed on Tris-Tricine gels and Western-blotted as previously described (13Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Google Scholar). In brief, 25 ॖg of proteins were separated on 16.5 Tris-Tricine gels, immobilized in nitrocellulose sheets, and probed with an anti-cytochrome c(rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Technologies) antibody. Immunological complexes were revealed with an anti-rabbit peroxidase (Immunotech) and electrochemiluminescence detection (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The PG13-luciferase p53 gene reporter construct (kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein) has been previously described (27El-Deiry W. Kern S. Pietenpol J. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 45-49Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated in 12-cell plates until 707 confluence and then co-transfected with 1.0 ॖg of PG13-luciferase cDNA and 0.5 ॖg of a ॆ-galactosidase transfection vector (to normalize transfection efficiency) by means of the DAC30 transfection reagent according the manufacturer conditions (Eurogentec). Forty-eight hours after transfection, luciferase and ॆ-galactosidase activities were analyzed according to manufacturer's conditions (Promega kit). HEK293 cells stably expressing the CTF-PS2 (CPS2) were cultivated in 6-well plates, preincubated with the inhibitor of caspase 3, Ac-DEVD-al (Neosystem), for 16 h, and then submitted to a period of 7 h of secretion in the cultivating media containing 17 instead of 107 fetal calf serum and 10 ॖm phosphoramidon (Sigma). Media were then recovered and analyzed for total Aॆ by combined immunoprecipitation FCA18 (28Barelli H. Lebeau A. Vizzavona J. Delaere P. Chevallier N. Drouot C. Marambaud P. Ancolio K. Buxbaum J.D. Khorkova O. Heroux J. Sahasrabudhe S. Martinez J. Warter J.-M. Mohr M. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1997; 3: 695-707Google Scholar) and Western blot with WO2 as previously described (29Ancolio K. Dumanchin C. Barelli H. Warter J.M. Brice A. Campion D. Frébourg T. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4119-4124Google Scholar). The setting up and characterization of stably HEK293 cells overexpressing the CTF of PS2 was previously reported (24Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 160-168Google Scholar). We previously showed that overexpression of the CTF-PS2 in these cells (compare lanes without Ac-DEVD-al in Fig.1C) led to an increased recovery of total amyloid ॆ-peptides (24Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 160-168Google Scholar). Here we confirm that CTF-PS2-expressing HEK293 cells secrete more Aॆ than mock-transfected control cells in basal conditions (Fig. 1, A andB). Interestingly, the caspase 3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-al drastically reduces Aॆ recovery in both cell systems (Fig. 1,A and E) and concomitantly increases endogenous (MOCK) and overexpressed (CPS2) CTF-PS2-like immunoreactivity (Fig. 1, C and F). Conversely, CTF-PS2 immunoreactivity was drastically lowered by the treatment of transfected cells with the apoptotic stimulus staurosporine (Fig.1D) in an Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive manner (not shown). This was accompanied by a staurosporine-stimulated increase of Aॆ recovery in both mock- and CTF-PS2-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). This modulation of the CTF-PS2-mediated control of ॆAPP maturation by apoptotic effector and inhibitor led us to deeply examine the putative role of CTF-PS2 in the control of cell death. First, we examined the capacity of CTF-PS2 to alter cell viability by means of TUNEL and DNA fragmentation analyses. TUNEL of apoptotic cells shows that overexpression of CTF-PS2 increases the number of stained nuclei in both basal and apoptotic conditions when compared with mock-transfected cells (Table I). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis of propidium iodide nuclei incorporation also showed increased DNA fragmentation in basal and staurosporine-stimulated cells (Table I). These two CTF-PS2-mediated phenotypes clearly illustrate a pro-apoptotic phenotype underlying associated decrease in cell viability.Table ICTF-PS2 triggers DNA fragmentation and increases the number of tunel-positive cellsTUNEL labelingMockCTF-PS2t test, p7 of controlBasal3.3 ± 0.527 ± 4p< 0.005Staurosporine5.2 ± 0.240 ± 3p< 0.00005Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysisMockCTF-PS2t test, p7 of controlBasal3 ± 0.710 ± 1.7p< 0.05Staurosporine13 ± 4.921 ± 5.2p< 0.01Apoptosis and DNA fragmentation were monitored by Tunel and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses as described under 舠Materials and Methods舡 in mock- or CTF-PS2-expressing cells in the absence (basal) or in presence of staurosporine.

Open table in a new tab Apoptosis and DNA fragmentation were monitored by Tunel and fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses as described under 舠Materials and Methods舡 in mock- or CTF-PS2-expressing cells in the absence (basal) or in presence of staurosporine. Means ± S.E. correspond to three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. Another signature of such an apoptotic process is the drastic increase of the Ac-DEVD-al-sensitive caspase 3-like activity triggered by CTF-PS2 in both basal and staurosporine-induced conditions (Fig.2A). In agreement, Fig.2B shows a drastic reduction of the immunoreactivity of the pro-caspase 3 precursor in cells overexpressing CTF-PS2, reflecting an increased maturation of the inactive precursor into its bioactive counterpart in CTF-PS2 transfected cells. We further examined caspase 3 modulation through the monitoring of the cleavage of one of its favored substrate, the poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). It is well documented that PARP occurs as an inactive precursor that is proteolytically converted into its active counterpart by caspase 3. Thus the ratio between PARP precursor over its product is generally an index of caspase 3 activity. In mock-transfected cells, as expected, the apoptotic stimulus staurosporine increases PARP product (Fig.3A) and, therefore, reduces the above-described ratio (Fig. 3B). Here again, cells expressing CTF-PS2 are associated with increased production of PARP product in both basal and staurosporine-stimulated conditions (Fig.3A), resulting in a drastically lower ratio when compared with mock-transfected cells, which indirectly again reflects increased caspase 3 activity (Fig. 3B).Figure 3CTF-PS2 overexpression increases PARPcleavage in HEK293 cells.

The histograms in Brepresent the quantitative analysis of five independent determinations expressed as the ratio precursor/product densitometric analysis reflecting PARP activation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To delineate the mechanisms by which CTF-PS2 could exert its caspase 3-mediated pro-apoptotic phenotype, we examined the putative contribution of the mitochondrial pathway. Staurosporine increases the translocation of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial fraction to the cytosol in mock-transfected cells (Fig.4, A and B). Overexpression of CTF-PS2 triggers a significant increase of the translocation of cytochrome c (Fig. 4, A andB) associated with reduced immunoreactivity of the antiapoptotic oncogene Bcl2 (Fig. 5,A and B), whereas Bax-like immunoreactivity remained unaffected (not shown). This likely contributed to the perturbation of the mitochondrial membrane permeability, resulting in cytochrome c translocation. It should be noted that in agreement with these data, CTF-PS2-expressing cells show a 250 and 1757 increase in propidium iodide incorporation in basal and stimulated conditions, respectively, after cell treatment with etoposide, an apoptotic effector targeting the mitochondrial compartment (not shown).Figure 5CTF-PS2 overexpression decreases Bcl2-like immunoreactivity.

Bars represent five independent determinations (means ± S.E.) expressed in percent of control mock-transfected cells taken as 100.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined whether CTF-PS2 expression could elicit its pro-apoptotic phenotype by a p53-dependent mechanism. As shown in Fig.6A, stably transfected CPS2 cells show an increased level of p53 immunoreactivity that is virtually doubled in transfected cells (Fig. 6B). This increased immunoreactivity is accompanied by a drastic potentiation of p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6C). We took advantage of the recent description of pifithrin-α, a selective blocker of p53 transcriptional activity to show a direct relationship between CTF-PS2-mediated p53 and caspase 3 activations. Fig. 7 shows little if any effect of PTFα in mock-transfected cells examined in basal conditions, whereas about 507 of the caspase 3 activity was inhibited in CTF-PS2-expressing cells (compare black and white bars in Fig. 7), indicating that the higher caspase3 activity observed in basal conditions in the latter cell system (Fig.2A) was related to p53 activity. An identical blockade of caspase 3 activation was observed in staurosporine-stimulated conditions (Fig. 7), indicating that both basal and staurosporine-induced caspase activation triggered by CTF-PS2 expression were blocked by PTFα. This demonstrates the direct modulation of caspase 3 activity by p53 as the main mechanism underlying CTF-mediated proapoptotic phenotype. Finally, to examine whether the CTF-PS2 was able to elicit its pro-apoptotic function in absence of its presenilinase-derived N-terminal counterpart, we transiently transfected fibroblasts in which the genes coding for PS1 and PS2 were invalidated with CTF-PS2 cDNA. Analyses of caspase 3-like activity in basal and STS-induced apoptosis clearly shows that the CTF-PS2 remains proapoptotic in PS−/− fibroblasts (Fig.8C). It is noteworthy that the effect of CTF-PS2 was significant only in stimulated conditions (Fig.8C). This could be explained by the relatively low transfection efficiency observed (Fig. 8A). Accordingly, the immunoreactivity of active caspase 3 (Fig. 8B) was enhanced in staurosporine-treated CTF-PS2-transfected PS−/−fibroblasts. Additionally, these results show that CTF-PS2 triggers the same phenotype in cell types of different origin, namely HEK293 human cells (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7), mouse embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 8), and telencephalon-specific murine (TSM1) neurons (data not shown), indicating that its pro-apoptotic function is not cell-specific. PS are multipotent proteins likely involved in distinct functions including among others control of ॆAPP processing, Notch and Wnt pathways, and adhesion (5Suh Y.-H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Google Scholar). PS1 and PS2 also appear to be involved in the modulation of cell death, although the two parent proteins seem to behave differently in this paradigm. Thus, PS2 was clearly characterized by several groups as a proapoptotic effector (13Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem. 2001; 79: 1161-1168Google Scholar), whereas PS1 decreases the susceptibility of neurons to apoptotic stimuli (34Bursztajn S. DeSouza R. McPhie D.L. Berman S.A. Shioi J. Robakis N.K. Neve R.L. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9790-9799Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that although the two proteins elicit opposite phenotypes, they both appear to be linked to the tumor suppressor p53 activity. Thus, it was established that p53 down-regulated PS1 expression, thereby leading to delayed apoptotic response (14Roperch J.-P. Alvaro V. Prieur S. Tyunder M. Nemani M. Lethrosne F. Piouffre L. Gendron M.-C. Israeli D. Dausset J. Oren M. Amson R. Telerman A. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 835-838Google Scholar). By contrast, we recently showed that PS2 and its pathogenic mutant N141I-PS2 drastically increased p53 expression and transcriptional activity in various cell systems (13Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Google Scholar). Interestingly, this was accompanied by a reduction of PS1 expression, suggesting a cross-talk between the two congener proteins (13Alves da Costa C. Paitel E. Mattson M.P. Amson R. Telerman A. Ancolio K. Checler F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4043-4048Google Scholar). PS are rapidly processed in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to N-terminal (NTF-PS) and C-terminal (CTF-PS) fragments that appear to associate with a 1/1 stoichiometry (7Thinakaran G. Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.H. Spitzer L. Kim G. Ratovitsky T. Davenport F. Nordstedt C. Seeger M. Hardy J. Levey A.I. Gandy S.E. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Sisodia S. Neuron. 1996; 17: 181-190Google Scholar). This heterodimer is thought to correspond to the biologically active complex responsible for PS-associated functions. Whether the maturated fragments couldper se modulate PS-related functions remained a matter of speculation. However, a pivotal work by Vito et al. (35Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Google Scholar) indicates that ALG3, the C-terminal 103 amino acids of mouse PS2, was able to rescue a T cell hybridoma from Fas-induced apoptosis (35Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L. Science. 1996; 271: 521-525Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same group showed that a C-terminal fragment of PS2 that can be physiologically generated by proteolysis and alternative transcription was able to rescue HeLa cells from Fas- and tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis (36Vito P. Ghayur T. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28315-28320Google Scholar). These studies could be envisioned as clues of functions specifically associated with PS-derived maturated fragments, although it could be argued that overexpression of these products displace their endogenous counterparts from the biological heteromeric complex. This possibility would not explain how the sole expression of one fragment could trigger a phenotype if this just results in a substitution limited stoichiometrically by the other endogenous counterpart. We previously showed that CTF-PS1 and CTF-PS2 overexpression led to an up-regulation of ॆAPP processing, yielding increased amounts of both α- and ॆ/γ-derived products APPα and Aॆ, respectively (24Alves da Costa C. Ancolio K. Checler F. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 160-168Google Scholar). We confirm that Aॆ production is increased upon overexpression of CTF-PS2 in the present study. This phenotype appears blocked by caspase 3-like inhibitors and stimulated by staurosporine with accompanying increase or lowering of CTF-PS2-like immunoreactivity, respectively. This suggests that increased Aॆ production is related to the caspase-derived cleavage product of CTF-PS2. The fact that CTF-PS2 undergoes breakdown upon staurosporine stimulus also argues for the possibility that CTF-PS2 behaves as the precursor of a caspase-derived fragment that could control cell death. This would well agree with the study carried out by Walter et al. (32Walter J. Schindzielorz A. Grünberg J. Haass C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1391-1396Google Scholar) that showed that phosphorylation of PS2 slowed down caspase-mediated cleavage and retarded apoptosis in HeLa cells. The mechanisms by which CTF-PS2 could trigger cell death remained to be established. Here we show for the first time that CTF-PS2 overexpression led to increased caspase 3 activity and immunoreactivity, enhanced cleavage of one of the favorite caspase 3 substrates, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and decreased expression of the antiapoptotic oncogene bcl-2. Whether the physical interaction between CTF-PS2 with bcl-2 described by Passeret al. (37Passer B.J. Pellegrini L. Vito P. Ganjei J.K. D'Adamio L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24007-24013Google Scholar) could explain our observed increased translocation of cytochrome c in the cytosol remains to be established. We established that the CTF-PS2-associated cell death was a p53-dependent phenomenon. Thus, CTF-PS2 increases both p53 expression and transcriptional activity (see Fig. 7). That CTF-PS2-associated p53 modulation and caspase activation were directly linked was evidenced by the fact that pifithrin-α, a selective blocker of p53, fully prevents the CTF-PS2-induced caspase activation (see Fig. 8). The mechanisms by which CTF-PS2 triggers cell death appear similar to the one we described for PS2 itself. Therefore, the possibility that CTF-PS2-associated phenotype could account entirely for that observed with PS2 remains a possibility. Interestingly, we demonstrate that CTF-PS2 also triggers caspase 3 activation in cells devoid of presenilins. Thus, PS−/−cells respond to transient transfection with CTF-PS2 by an augmentation of both caspase 3 immunoreactivity and activity. This means that unlike what appears to be the case for APP processing, the presence of the N-terminal counterpart is not an absolute requirement for CTF-PS2 proapoptotic phenotype. It is interesting to note that CTF-PS2-like immunoreactivity could be detected in the liver of adult mice in which PS genes had been disrupted (35Vito P. Lacana E. D'Adamio L.

A. 1997; 94: 10479-10484Google Scholar).The PRK·GAPDH core complex is linked to photosynthesis, as these two enzymes are part of the Benson-Calvin cycle and use ATP and NADPH produced by the primary reactions of photosynthesis. PRK catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose 5-phosphate to form ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the CO2 acceptor in photosynthetic organisms, and GAPDH catalyzes the reversible reduction and dephosphorylation of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate using NADPH.We have purified a complex from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (10Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Google Scholar) that is made up of two dimeric PRK and two tetrameric GAPDH. The protein CP12 (20Wedel N. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9699-9704Google Scholar, 21Wedel N. Soll J. Paap B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10479-10484Google Scholar, 22Pohlmeyer K. Paap B.K. Soll J. Wedel N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 969-978Google Scholar) was found recently to be associated with this supramolecular edifice (23Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 129-136Google Scholar). The two enzymes, PRK and GAPDH, may each be obtained in a free independent state. When they are not associated with each other they form dimers (PRK) or tetramers (GAPDH). CP12 is tightly associated with GAPDH (23Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 129-136Google Scholar). The complex can be dissociated by harsh reduction and reversed by oxidizing conditions, because the oxidized partners can spontaneously reform a complexin vitro that is quite similar to the native state (10Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Google Scholar). In only a few cases has it been possible to assemble particles from their separate parts in vitro that resemble the native complexes (24Reed L.J. Pettit F.H. Eley M.H. Hamilton L. Collins J.H. Oliver R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3068-3072Google Scholar, 25Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Google Scholar). The association of these two enzymes also gives rise to new regulatory properties. PRK and GAPDH within the complex are regulated by NADP(H) rather than by NAD(H), whereas the independent stable enzymes are not (26Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12697-12702Google Scholar). Oxidized PRK may be active when associated with GAPDH or when dissociated from the complex upon dilution (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar). We have also shown that the complex may exist under mild reducing conditions (12Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Google Scholar) even if it is dissociated by severe reducing conditions (DTT concentrations up to 20 mm). But it dissociates faster upon dilution, as reduction weakens the complex.Whereas plant enzymes are heterotetrameric (A2B2), algal GAPDHs are homotetrameric and made up of only A subunits (27Cerff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 243-247Google Scholar, 28Qi J. Isupov M.N. Littlechild J.A. Anderson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35247-35252Google Scholar). The B subunit has a C-terminal extension that contains two cysteine residues believed to be involved in the regulation of the enzyme (29Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar, 30Scheibe R. Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 228-234Google Scholar, 31Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44946-44952Google Scholar). Nonetheless, studies on crude extracts of Chlamydomonas indicate that the algal enzyme that lacks these 28 amino acid residues can be activated reductively by light (32Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Huppe H.C. Kersanach R. Anderson L.E. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 51: 167-177Google Scholar). We have studied the regulation of this enzyme upon reduction or oxidation in its isolated state or within the PRK·GAPDH·CP12 complex to see if this reductive light activation is explained by the interaction of GAPDH with its protein partners. The same study was performed on the other partner, PRK. In previous studies (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar) we have fully characterized the activity of isolated PRK and PRK in the complex. PRK in the so-called oxidized complex was active as mentioned above, but this result has been disputed (33Miziorko H.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 95-127Google Scholar), as the cysteinyl sulfhydryls of PRK in the complex have never been directly tested. We have therefore used mass spectrometry coupled with protein chemistry to analyze the cysteinyl sulfhydryl contents of PRK, GAPDH, and CP12 in the complex, whatever its redox state.Finally, we have used a biosensor to study the interaction between the two enzymes depending on their redox states, as cellular redox signaling contributes to the control of the Benson-Calvin cycle and many other physiological processes (34Cooper C.E. Patel R.P. Brookes P.S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 489-492Google Scholar). The qualitative and quantitative aspects of these interactions have been analyzed.DISCUSSIONMany enzymes belonging to the Benson-Calvin cycle are regulated by dark-light transitions via thioredoxins in vivo (38Balmer Y. Buchanan B.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 191-193Google Scholar) (or dithiothreitol in vitro). In particular, thioredoxin (39Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24736-24740Google Scholar,40Geck M.K. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18034-18039Google Scholar) reduces the disulfide between Cys55 and Cys16 of inactive oxidized spinach PRK (41Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3333-3335Google Scholar, 42Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10694-10699Google Scholar).We have shown (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar) that oxidized PRK from C. reinhardtii may have some activity when it is associated with GAPDH, contrary to common belief, but no direct evidence of the regulatory disulfide bridge between Cys16 and Cys55 present in oxidized PRK, was given. We have now used alkylation of the so-called oxidized complex to show that there is one disulfide bridge in the PRK monomer. The activity of PRK is greatly increased when it is reduced, indicating that the Cys16–Cys55 bond is the target.Another troubling aspect of the activity of oxidized PRK concerns the P-loop. This contains residues that interact with the ॆ- and γ-phosphoryls of Mg2+-ATP (43Runquist J.A. Rios S.E. Vinarov D.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14530-14537Google Scholar). This loop should a priori be free to move for efficient catalysis. Some data for bacterial PRK (33Miziorko H.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 95-127Google Scholar, 44Harrison D.H. Runquist J.A. Holub A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5074-5085Google Scholar) suggest that the Cys16–Cys55 disulfide bridge found only in the eukaryotic enzymes could immobilize the P-loop, thereby preventing catalytic turnover. However, it is worthwhile to pinpoint that there are insertions and deletions in the plant and algal enzymes, such as an insertion of 15 residues after the P-loop of the eukaryotic enzyme that may modify its mobility even in the presence of the Cys16–Cys55 disulfide bridge. These sulfhydryl groups are also not essential for catalysis, as a Cys16–Cys55 double mutant of spinach PRK still has some activity (42Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10694-10699Google Scholar, 45Brandes H.K. Hartman F.C. Lu T.Y. Larimer F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6490-6496Google Scholar). The conformational constraint imposed by this bond is more likely to be responsible for the decreased PRK activity than the formation of the disulfide bridge itself (45Brandes H.K. Hartman F.C. Lu T.Y. Larimer F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6490-6496Google Scholar). Thus, although the bacterial PRK structure is a useful model, it may not be wise to extrapolate data obtained with it to eukaryotic PRKs, especially the eukaryotic enzyme in a multienzyme complex. Our results indicate that the conformational constraint near the P-loop could be attenuated when the PRK is within the complex, allowing oxidized PRK to be active. The interaction of PRK with GAPDH modifies the conformation of this enzyme (46Mouche F. Gontero B. Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Boisset N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6743-6749Google Scholar) and hence its kinetic properties (12Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Google Scholar, 14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar).There is now considerable published evidence from NMR studies that supramolecular edifices (protein-protein or DNA-protein complexes) appear to be flexible (47Finerty Jr., P.J. Muhandiram R. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 605-620Google Scholar, 48Yu L. Zhu C.X. Tse-Dinh Y.C. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9661-9666Google Scholar). The entropic cost of the decrease in conformational freedom must be offset, to some extent, by preserving the flexibility of other regions. These reports support the assertion made above by the authors, but only structural data will clarify this point. Our direct evaluation of the redox status of the regulatory cysteine residues now clearly shows that oxidized PRK may be catalytically active. This activity is, however, lower than the activity of the released metastable form, as the PRK-GAPDH association hampers the overall flexibility of these enzymes. The released PRK with decreased conformational constraint around the P-loop, because of a memory effect, and with greater overall flexibility is thus a better catalyst than the enzyme in the complex.Whereas each PRK monomer in the oxidized complex has one disulfide bridge, all the cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups of GAPDH are free and CP12 has two disulfide bridges. We found five cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups per PRK subunit by alkylation after reduction of the oxidized complex. The GAPDH content of thiol groups obviously does not change, but two or four thiol groups become titrated per CP12 monomer. Reduction of the PRK disulfide bridge is followed by an increase in enzyme activity, as mentioned above.Chlamydomonas GAPDH is an A4 homotetramer; the regulatory cysteine residues are thus absent (28Qi J. Isupov M.N. Littlechild J.A. Anderson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35247-35252Google Scholar, 31Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44946-44952Google Scholar). Nonetheless, incubation of a crude extract with DTT increased its enzyme activity 3-fold (32Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Huppe H.C. Kersanach R. Anderson L.E. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 51: 167-177Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, we saw the same increase in NADPH-dependent activity for GAPDH when it was part of the complex, but not for the isolated enzyme. We therefore proposed (49Heineke D. Burgi R. Heike G. Hoferichter P. Peter U. Flügge U.I. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 1131-1137Google Scholar) that this modulation had a physiological role, as the NADPH concentrations are increased in the light. Our present results also show that reducing the complex leads to a decrease in the use of NADH.As titration of the thiol groups in GAPDH in the complex reveals 4 SH groups whatever the redox state of the complex, the modulation of GAPDH activity is not linked to disulfide reduction. Our present finding also indicates that these effects are linked to heterologous interactions within the complex as there is no longer an effect once these interactions are weakened or broken. This supports the idea mentioned above that new properties may emerge as a consequence of conformation change within multienzyme complexes. It also shows that the regulation of an enzyme like PRK may modulate the regulation of another (GAPDH) via a 舠domino-like舡 effect.We have tested the effect of oxidizing agents on PRK and GAPDH activities, as oxidized thioredoxin causes the oxidation of the light-reduced enzymes. Treatment with oxidants caused the activity of reduced PRK isolated or released from the complex (e.g.using cystine) to decrease. This effect was reversed by reduction, as expected. The situation is quite different for GAPDH, as the loss of activity by the isolated enzyme that follows incubation with oxidized glutathione is very likely because of a modification of the active site cysteine (Cys156), as it is well documented for other GAPDHs (50Harris J.I. Waters M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-49Google Scholar). This is also supported by protection experiments using BPGA and by the fact that oxidized thioredoxins have no effect on GAPDH activity. The inactivation is not reversed by a reducing agent. It has been suggested that the oxidation of glycolytic enzymes may introduce an element of strain resulting from the formation of a disulfide bond, which then causes an irreversible conformational change, perhaps with displacement of an essential residue from the active site. GAPDH is not significantly inactivated by oxidized glutathione even after dissociation of the complex, like PRK. This may be because the cysteinyl sulfhydryl in this molecule is less exposed than is that in the isolated GAPDH. We checked this by measuring the enzyme kinetics of the isolated GAPDH and of the released form from the complex. The differences observed with the pseudo-affinity constants for BPGA clearly support the assertion made above. Thus, GAPDH retains the conformation it had within the complex (imprinting) even after the physical separation of PRK and GAPDH, so that the sulhydryl group of the Cys156 is poorly accessible to oxidized glutathione. This corroborates the imprinting effect previously reported (12Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Google Scholar, 13Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Google Scholar,26Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12697-12702Google Scholar).Finally, the complex we have purified is a suitable model with which to study protein-protein interactions, but most of the information on it stems from in vitro reconstitution experiments. This report, for the first time, describes the use of Biosensor technology to determine the dynamics of these interactions between PRK and the GAPDH·CP12 subcomplex under different redox states. The dissociation constants between the PRK and GAPDH·CP12 subcomplex are rather low (nm range), with the lowest value (14 ± 1.6 nm) being obtained with oxidized PRK. The probable conformational change caused by the chemical modification of GAPDH by oxidation has no influence on the binding of GAPDH to PRK andvice versa. The SPR results indicate that these enzymes (PRK and GAPDH/CP12) may reconstitute the complex under reducing conditions with a low dissociation constant (62 ± 10 nm) even if complex formation is sensitive to the redox state of PRK. Our results also suggest that this complex may form at pH 7, under oxidizing conditions (dark conditions) or at pH 8, under mild reducing conditions (light conditions).To conclude, thiol/disulfide exchange influences the state of activation of chloroplast PRK, in its isolated form and when it is part of a complex. On the other hand, the modulation of PRK activity influences the state of activation of GAPDH via protein-protein interactions, at least in the alga C. reinhardtii. A new mode of light regulation could emerge that involves a 舠domino effect舡 and this could well apply to enzymes that are not direct targets of light. Phosphoribulokinase (PRK)1 (EC 2.7.1.19) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (EC 1.2.1.13) form multienzyme complexes.

The PRK·GAPDH core complex is linked to photosynthesis, as these two enzymes are part of the Benson-Calvin cycle and use ATP and NADPH produced by the primary reactions of photosynthesis. PRK catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of ribulose 5-phosphate to form ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the CO2 acceptor in photosynthetic organisms, and GAPDH catalyzes the reversible reduction and dephosphorylation of 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate (BPGA) to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate using NADPH. We have purified a complex from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (10Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Google Scholar) that is made up of two dimeric PRK and two tetrameric GAPDH. The protein CP12 (20Wedel N. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9699-9704Google Scholar, 21Wedel N. Soll J. Paap B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10479-10484Google Scholar, 22Pohlmeyer K. Paap B.K. Soll J. Wedel N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 969-978Google Scholar) was found recently to be associated with this supramolecular edifice (23Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 129-136Google Scholar). The two enzymes, PRK and GAPDH, may each be obtained in a free independent state. When they are not associated with each other they form dimers (PRK) or tetramers (GAPDH). CP12 is tightly associated with GAPDH (23Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 129-136Google Scholar). The complex can be dissociated by harsh reduction and reversed by oxidizing conditions, because the oxidized partners can spontaneously reform a complexin vitro that is quite similar to the native state (10Avilan L. Gontero B. Lebreton S. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 78-84Google Scholar). In only a few cases has it been possible to assemble particles from their separate parts in vitro that resemble the native complexes (24Reed L.J. Pettit F.H. Eley M.H. Hamilton L. Collins J.H. Oliver R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 3068-3072Google Scholar, 25Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Google Scholar). The association of these two enzymes also gives rise to new regulatory properties. PRK and GAPDH within the complex are regulated by NADP(H) rather than by NAD(H), whereas the independent stable enzymes are not (26Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12697-12702Google Scholar). Oxidized PRK may be active when associated with GAPDH or when dissociated from the complex upon dilution (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar). We have also shown that the complex may exist under mild reducing conditions (12Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Google Scholar) even if it is dissociated by severe reducing conditions (DTT concentrations up to 20 mm). But it dissociates faster upon dilution, as reduction weakens the complex. Whereas plant enzymes are heterotetrameric (A2B2), algal GAPDHs are homotetrameric and made up of only A subunits (27Cerff R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 94: 243-247Google Scholar, 28Qi J. Isupov M.N. Littlechild J.A. Anderson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35247-35252Google Scholar). The B subunit has a C-terminal extension that contains two cysteine residues believed to be involved in the regulation of the enzyme (29Baalmann E. Scheibe R. Cerff R. Martin W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 505-513Google Scholar, 30Scheibe R. Baalmann E. Backhausen J.E. Rak C. Vetter S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1296: 228-234Google Scholar, 31Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44946-44952Google Scholar). Nonetheless, studies on crude extracts of Chlamydomonas indicate that the algal enzyme that lacks these 28 amino acid residues can be activated reductively by light (32Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Huppe H.C. Kersanach R. Anderson L.E. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 51: 167-177Google Scholar). We have studied the regulation of this enzyme upon reduction or oxidation in its isolated state or within the PRK·GAPDH·CP12 complex to see if this reductive light activation is explained by the interaction of GAPDH with its protein partners. The same study was performed on the other partner, PRK. In previous studies (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar) we have fully characterized the activity of isolated PRK and PRK in the complex. PRK in the so-called oxidized complex was active as mentioned above, but this result has been disputed (33Miziorko H.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 95-127Google Scholar), as the cysteinyl sulfhydryls of PRK in the complex have never been directly tested. We have therefore used mass spectrometry coupled with protein chemistry to analyze the cysteinyl sulfhydryl contents of PRK, GAPDH, and CP12 in the complex, whatever its redox state. Finally, we have used a biosensor to study the interaction between the two enzymes depending on their redox states, as cellular redox signaling contributes to the control of the Benson-Calvin cycle and many other physiological processes (34Cooper C.E. Patel R.P. Brookes P.S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 489-492Google Scholar). The qualitative and quantitative aspects of these interactions have been analyzed. DISCUSSIONMany enzymes belonging to the Benson-Calvin cycle are regulated by dark-light transitions via thioredoxins in vivo (38Balmer Y. Buchanan B.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 191-193Google Scholar) (or dithiothreitol in vitro). In particular, thioredoxin (39Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24736-24740Google Scholar,40Geck M.K. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18034-18039Google Scholar) reduces the disulfide between Cys55 and Cys16 of inactive oxidized spinach PRK (41Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3333-3335Google Scholar, 42Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10694-10699Google Scholar).We have shown (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar) that oxidized PRK from C. reinhardtii may have some activity when it is associated with GAPDH, contrary to common belief, but no direct evidence of the regulatory disulfide bridge between Cys16 and Cys55 present in oxidized PRK, was given. We have now used alkylation of the so-called oxidized complex to show that there is one disulfide bridge in the PRK monomer. The activity of PRK is greatly increased when it is reduced, indicating that the Cys16–Cys55 bond is the target.Another troubling aspect of the activity of oxidized PRK concerns the P-loop. This contains residues that interact with the ॆ- and γ-phosphoryls of Mg2+-ATP (43Runquist J.A. Rios S.E. Vinarov D.A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14530-14537Google Scholar). This loop should a priori be free to move for efficient catalysis. Some data for bacterial PRK (33Miziorko H.M. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 95-127Google Scholar, 44Harrison D.H. Runquist J.A. Holub A. Miziorko H.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5074-5085Google Scholar) suggest that the Cys16–Cys55 disulfide bridge found only in the eukaryotic enzymes could immobilize the P-loop, thereby preventing catalytic turnover. However, it is worthwhile to pinpoint that there are insertions and deletions in the plant and algal enzymes, such as an insertion of 15 residues after the P-loop of the eukaryotic enzyme that may modify its mobility even in the presence of the Cys16–Cys55 disulfide bridge. These sulfhydryl groups are also not essential for catalysis, as a Cys16–Cys55 double mutant of spinach PRK still has some activity (42Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10694-10699Google Scholar, 45Brandes H.K. Hartman F.C. Lu T.Y. Larimer F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6490-6496Google Scholar). The conformational constraint imposed by this bond is more likely to be responsible for the decreased PRK activity than the formation of the disulfide bridge itself (45Brandes H.K. Hartman F.C. Lu T.Y. Larimer F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6490-6496Google Scholar). Thus, although the bacterial PRK structure is a useful model, it may not be wise to extrapolate data obtained with it to eukaryotic PRKs, especially the eukaryotic enzyme in a multienzyme complex. Our results indicate that the conformational constraint near the P-loop could be attenuated when the PRK is within the complex, allowing oxidized PRK to be active. The interaction of PRK with GAPDH modifies the conformation of this enzyme (46Mouche F. Gontero B. Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. Boisset N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6743-6749Google Scholar) and hence its kinetic properties (12Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Google Scholar, 14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 85-91Google Scholar).There is now considerable published evidence from NMR studies that supramolecular edifices (protein-protein or DNA-protein complexes) appear to be flexible (47Finerty Jr., P.J. Muhandiram R. Forman-Kay J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 322: 605-620Google Scholar, 48Yu L. Zhu C.X. Tse-Dinh Y.C. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9661-9666Google Scholar). The entropic cost of the decrease in conformational freedom must be offset, to some extent, by preserving the flexibility of other regions. These reports support the assertion made above by the authors, but only structural data will clarify this point. Our direct evaluation of the redox status of the regulatory cysteine residues now clearly shows that oxidized PRK may be catalytically active. This activity is, however, lower than the activity of the released metastable form, as the PRK-GAPDH association hampers the overall flexibility of these enzymes. The released PRK with decreased conformational constraint around the P-loop, because of a memory effect, and with greater overall flexibility is thus a better catalyst than the enzyme in the complex.Whereas each PRK monomer in the oxidized complex has one disulfide bridge, all the cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups of GAPDH are free and CP12 has two disulfide bridges. We found five cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups per PRK subunit by alkylation after reduction of the oxidized complex. The GAPDH content of thiol groups obviously does not change, but two or four thiol groups become titrated per CP12 monomer. Reduction of the PRK disulfide bridge is followed by an increase in enzyme activity, as mentioned above.Chlamydomonas GAPDH is an A4 homotetramer; the regulatory cysteine residues are thus absent (28Qi J. Isupov M.N. Littlechild J.A. Anderson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35247-35252Google Scholar, 31Sparla F. Pupillo P. Trost P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44946-44952Google Scholar). Nonetheless, incubation of a crude extract with DTT increased its enzyme activity 3-fold (32Li A.D. Stevens F.J. Huppe H.C. Kersanach R. Anderson L.E. Photosyn. Res. 1997; 51: 167-177Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, we saw the same increase in NADPH-dependent activity for GAPDH when it was part of the complex, but not for the isolated enzyme. We therefore proposed (49Heineke D. Burgi R. Heike G. Hoferichter P. Peter U. Flügge U.I. Heldt H.W. Plant Physiol. 1991; 95: 1131-1137Google Scholar) that this modulation had a physiological role, as the NADPH concentrations are increased in the light. Our present results also show that reducing the complex leads to a decrease in the use of NADH.As titration of the thiol groups in GAPDH in the complex reveals 4 SH groups whatever the redox state of the complex, the modulation of GAPDH activity is not linked to disulfide reduction. Our present finding also indicates that these effects are linked to heterologous interactions within the complex as there is no longer an effect once these interactions are weakened or broken. This supports the idea mentioned above that new properties may emerge as a consequence of conformation change within multienzyme complexes. It also shows that the regulation of an enzyme like PRK may modulate the regulation of another (GAPDH) via a 舠domino-like舡 effect.We have tested the effect of oxidizing agents on PRK and GAPDH activities, as oxidized thioredoxin causes the oxidation of the light-reduced enzymes. Treatment with oxidants caused the activity of reduced PRK isolated or released from the complex (e.g.using cystine) to decrease. This effect was reversed by reduction, as expected. The situation is quite different for GAPDH, as the loss of activity by the isolated enzyme that follows incubation with oxidized glutathione is very likely because of a modification of the active site cysteine (Cys156), as it is well documented for other GAPDHs (50Harris J.I. Waters M. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 13. Academic Press, New York1976: 1-49Google Scholar). This is also supported by protection experiments using BPGA and by the fact that oxidized thioredoxins have no effect on GAPDH activity. The inactivation is not reversed by a reducing agent. It has been suggested that the oxidation of glycolytic enzymes may introduce an element of strain resulting from the formation of a disulfide bond, which then causes an irreversible conformational change, perhaps with displacement of an essential residue from the active site. GAPDH is not significantly inactivated by oxidized glutathione even after dissociation of the complex, like PRK. This may be because the cysteinyl sulfhydryl in this molecule is less exposed than is that in the isolated GAPDH. We checked this by measuring the enzyme kinetics of the isolated GAPDH and of the released form from the complex. The differences observed with the pseudo-affinity constants for BPGA clearly support the assertion made above. Thus, GAPDH retains the conformation it had within the complex (imprinting) even after the physical separation of PRK and GAPDH, so that the sulhydryl group of the Cys156 is poorly accessible to oxidized glutathione. This corroborates the imprinting effect previously reported (12Lebreton S. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20879-20884Google Scholar, 13Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 286-295Google Scholar,26Graciet E. Lebreton S. Camadro J.M. Gontero B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12697-12702Google Scholar).Finally, the complex we have purified is a suitable model with which to study protein-protein interactions, but most of the information on it stems from in vitro reconstitution experiments. This report, for the first time, describes the use of Biosensor technology to determine the dynamics of these interactions between PRK and the GAPDH·CP12 subcomplex under different redox states. The dissociation constants between the PRK and GAPDH·CP12 subcomplex are rather low (nm range), with the lowest value (14 ± 1.6 nm) being obtained with oxidized PRK. The probable conformational change caused by the chemical modification of GAPDH by oxidation has no influence on the binding of GAPDH to PRK andvice versa. The SPR results indicate that these enzymes (PRK and GAPDH/CP12) may reconstitute the complex under reducing conditions with a low dissociation constant (62 ± 10 nm) even if complex formation is sensitive to the redox state of PRK. Our results also suggest that this complex may form at pH 7, under oxidizing conditions (dark conditions) or at pH 8, under mild reducing conditions (light conditions).To conclude, thiol/disulfide exchange influences the state of activation of chloroplast PRK, in its isolated form and when it is part of a complex. On the other hand, the modulation of PRK activity influences the state of activation of GAPDH via protein-protein interactions, at least in the alga C. reinhardtii. A new mode of light regulation could emerge that involves a 舠domino effect舡 and this could well apply to enzymes that are not direct targets of light. Many enzymes belonging to the Benson-Calvin cycle are regulated by dark-light transitions via thioredoxins in vivo (38Balmer Y. Buchanan B.B. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 191-193Google Scholar) (or dithiothreitol in vitro). In particular, thioredoxin (39Geck M.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 18034-18039Google Scholar) reduces the disulfide between Cys55 and Cys16 of inactive oxidized spinach PRK (41Brandes H.K. Larimer F.W. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3333-3335Google Scholar, 42Milanez S. Mural R.J. Hartman F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10694-10699Google Scholar). We have shown (14Lebreton S. Gontero B. Avilan L. Ricard J. Eur.

The dissociation constants between the PRK and GAPDH·CP12 subcomplex are rather low (nm range), with the lowest value (14 ± 1.6 nm) being obtained with oxidized PRK. The probable conformational change caused by the chemical modification of GAPDH by oxidation has no influence on the binding of GAPDH to PRK andvice versa. The SPR results indicate that these enzymes (PRK and GAPDH/CP12) may reconstitute the complex under reducing conditions with a low dissociation constant (62 ± 10 nm) even if complex formation is sensitive to the redox state of PRK. Our results also suggest that this complex may form at pH 7, under oxidizing conditions (dark conditions) or at pH 8, under mild reducing conditions (light conditions). To conclude, thiol/disulfide exchange influences the state of activation of chloroplast PRK, in its isolated form and when it is part of a complex. On the other hand, the modulation of PRK activity influences the state of activation of GAPDH via protein-protein interactions, at least in the alga C. reinhardtii. A new mode of light regulation could emerge that involves a 舠domino effect舡 and this could well apply to enzymes that are not direct targets of light.

Here we evaluated the role ofEhPgp5 mRNA stability on MDR using actinomycin D.EhPgp5 mRNA from trophozoites growing without emetine had a half-life of 2.1 h, which augmented to 3.1 h in cells cultured with 90 μm and to 7.8 h with 225 μm emetine.

Biomembr. 1995; 27: 77-84Google Scholar). MDR is associated with the overexpression of a 170-kDa membrane molecule known as P-glycoprotein (PGP), an energy-dependent pump that extrudes drugs from the cells (5Endicott J.A. Ling V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 137-171Google Scholar, 6Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Smyth M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 1-6Google Scholar). In E. histolytica, MDR phenotype is given mainly by overexpression of the EhPgp1 and EhPgp5 genes, which are finely regulated by transcriptional factors (7Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Orozco E. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 201-211Google Scholar, 8Marchat L. Gómez C. Pérez D.G. Paz F. Mendoza L. Orozco E. Cell. Microbiol. 2002; 4: 725-737Google Scholar, 9Orozco E. López C. Gómez C. Pérez D.G. Marchat L. Bañuelos C. Delgadillo D. Parasitol. Int. 2002; 51: 353-355Google Scholar). AlthoughEhPgp1 is constitutively expressed in drug-resistant trophozoites of clone C2, EhPgp5 gene is overexpressed only when C2 cells are grown in a high emetine concentration (10Gómez C. Pérez D.G. López-Bayghen E. Orozco E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7277-7284Google Scholar, 11Pérez D.G. Gómez C. López-Bayghen E. Tannich E. Orozco E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7285-7292Google Scholar). Both genes are also amplified in the presence of a high drug concentration (12López C. Gómez C. Pérez D.G. Flores E. Orozco E. Arch. Med. Res. 1997; 28 (suppl.): 66-68Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic mdr genes has been considered as the major control point for PGP synthesis, although gene amplification mechanisms also participate in this event (12López C. Gómez C. Pérez D.G. Flores E. Orozco E. Arch. Med. Res. 1997; 28 (suppl.): 66-68Google Scholar, 13Shen D.W. Fojo A. Chin J.E. Roninson I.B. Richert N. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. Science. 1986; 232: 643-645Google Scholar). Moreover, there is growing evidence of pivotal post-transcriptional (14Lee C.H. Bradley G. Ling V.

Physiol. 2000; 184: 17-26Google Scholar) regulation of the PGP expression. On the other hand, mRNA stability has recently emerged as a critical control step in determining cellular stationary mRNA levels. The abundance of a particular mRNA can fluctuate many folds due to alterations in mRNA stability without any change in the transcription rate (21Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Google Scholar). The mRNA half-life is determined by a complex set of protein interactions at the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) depending on conserved cis-element sequences and secondary structures (for review, see Ref. 22Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Google Scholar). The 3′-UTR also contains consensus sequence elements that mediate mRNA nuclear export, cytoplasmic localization, translation efficacy, and polyadenylation control (23Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Google Scholar, 24Decker C.J. Parker R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 386-392Google Scholar). The pre-mRNAs are polyadenylated in a reaction involving 3′ endonucleolytic cleavage followed by poly(A) tail synthesis (25Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Google Scholar). Poly(A) tail is also a modulator of mRNA stability and translation (26Sachs A. Sonenberg N. Hershey J.W.B. Mathews M.B. Translational Control of Gene Expression. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2000: 447-465Google Scholar, 27Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Google Scholar). Strict control of poly(A) tail length is achieved by the concerted interplay of key factors, including poly(A) polymerase, deadenylases, and poly(A)-binding protein activities (25Zhao J. Hyman L. Moore C. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 405-445Google Scholar). Several reports have addressed the importance of mRNA stability on the mdr genes expression regulation.Pgp1, Pgp2, and Pgp3 mRNAs have a higher half-life in rat tumor cells than in normal cells (15Lee C.H. Bradley G. Ling V. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 177: 1-12Google Scholar), whereas rat MDR hepatocytes in culture present a higher amount of PGP2 protein due to a post-transcriptional mechanism controlling mRNA stability (14Lee C.H. Bradley G. Ling V. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 347-354Google Scholar). Human MDR1 mRNA has a half-life of 30 min, which is prolonged to more than 20 h upon treatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that protein synthesis inhibition may influence the stability of certain mRNAs (16Prokipcak R.D. Raouf A. Lee C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 627-634Google Scholar, 17Lee C.H. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 216: 103-110Google Scholar). However, molecular mechanisms controlling mdr mRNA stability remains to be elucidated. In E. histolytica, mRNA stability mechanisms have not been studied yet. The presence of higher levels of EhPGP5 protein in the multidrug-resistant trophozoites of clone C2 could be influenced by both transcriptional activation and increased mRNA stability. In this paper, we measured the EhPgp5 mRNA half-life in trophozoites of clone C2 grown at different emetine concentrations. Our data showed that EhPgp5 mRNA stability is increased at high emetine concentrations, indicating that mRNA half-life is also regulating the MDR phenotype. In addition, here we initiated the study of the mechanisms involved in mRNA turnover in this parasite. Trophozoites of the clones A (drug-sensitive) and C2 (drug-resistant) (strain HM1:IMSS) (28Orozco E. Hernandez F. Rodriguez M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1985; 15: 49-59Google Scholar) were axenically cultured in TYI-S-33 medium (29Diamond L.S. Harlow R. Cunnick C. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1978; 72: 431-432Google Scholar). Trophozoites of clone C2 were cultured without emetine (C2) or with 90 (C2(90)) and 225 (C2(225)) μm emetine. Logarithmic phase growing cultures were used in all experiments. All assays presented here were performed at least three times by duplicate. Actinomycin D (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) (0.5 mg/ml) was added to the trophozoites cultures to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml of medium, and cells were incubated at 37 °C for different times. Fresh medium supplemented with [3H]UTP (10 μCi/ml) was added to the actinomycind-treated trophozoites for 2 more hours in the absence of actinomycin D. Immediately, total RNA was isolated by TRIzol™ (Invitrogen). Incorporation of [3H]UTP in 20 μg of total RNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting system (Beckman) in duplicate samples, and data obtained were plotted. Cytotoxicity of actinomycin D and Me2SO was checked by cell viability using trypan blue and measuring the growth rate of the treated cultures. 100 ng of total RNA from trophozoites of clones A, C2, C2(90), and C2(225) were preincubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Stratagene). Single-stranded cDNAs were synthesized using 10 mm each dNTP and 100 ng of oligo(dT18) in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. The mixture was heat-denatured at 65 °C for 5 min and quick-chilled on ice. Then we added buffer used to synthesize the first-strand (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2), 100 mm dithiothreitol, 200 units of SuperscriptTMII RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and 40 units of SUPERase-in ribonuclease inhibitor (Ambion). This mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 1 h. To remove the excess RNA template, 2 units of RNase H (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. Quantitative multiplex PCR for EhPgp5 and actin cDNAs were performed with 1/5 volume of the reverse transcription mixture, 10 mm each dNTPs, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), and theEhPgp5 (5′-GTAGGAGGTGCAGTATTTCC-3′) sense and (5′-CCATCCTATTTCTTGTTTGAC-3′) antisense internal primers (30Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Samuelson J. Orozco E. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 164: 179-184Google Scholar). The actin (5′-AGCTGTTCTTTCATTATATGC-3′) sense and (5′-TTCTCTTTCAGCAGTAGTGGT-3′) antisense internal primers (31Edman U. Meza I. Agabian N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 4: 3024-3028Google Scholar) were used in the same sample as an internal control. PCR was done in 22 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 35 s, 72 °C for 90 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. Amplified products were separated by 6% PAGE. Total RNA from trophozoites of clones C2, C2(90), and C2(225) was obtained at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 h after actinomycin d-induced transcriptional blockage. EhPgp5 and actin mRNAs were measured by multiplex RT-PCR as described above, and intensity of the bands in ethidium bromide-stained gels was quantified by densitometric analysis in a PhosphorImager apparatus (Personal Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). The pixels given by the actin transcript in trophozoites of clones C2, C2(90), and C2(225) without treatment (t 0) were taken as 100% in each clone.EhPgp5 mRNA levels were normalized with respect to the actin amount in each lane. Experimental EhPgp5 mRNA half-life (the time at which 50% of mRNA molecules remained intact) was determined by plotting the EhPgp5 mRNA amount at different times on a semilogarithmic scale. In these estimations the EhPgp5 mRNA amount att 0 was taken as 100% in each clone. Theoretical half-life of the EhPgp5 mRNA was obtained from the logarithmically transformed best-fit line by linear regression analysis using the decay equation t 12 = ln 2/K, where K corresponds to the decay constant (32Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 475-493Google Scholar). 20 μg of total RNA from trophozoites of clones C2, C2(90), and C2(225) were hybridized with a 697 bp of [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)-labeled probe corresponding to the last 100 bp of theEhPgp5 coding region and 597 bp of the EhPgp53′-UTR genomic sequence. The probe was PCR-amplified from the P4 plasmid, which contains the last 1466 bp of theEhPgp5-coding region and ∼1500 bp of its 3′-UTR genomic sequence (7Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Orozco E. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 201-211Google Scholar), using the EhPgp5-3′-UTR-S (5′-AAAATAGTAGAACAAGGA-3′) sense and EhPgp5-3′-UTR-AS (5′-CGAACAAAGGCTTAAA-3′) antisense primers. AmplifiedEhPgp5-3′-UTR fragment was sequenced in a ABI PRISM automatic sequencer. Purified DNA probe was heat-denatured at 95 °C for 15 min and cooled at 4 °C for 3 min. Then, an RNA aliquot was added, and immediately, the DNA/RNA hybrid mixture was co-precipitated with ethanol at −20 °C overnight. A DNA/RNA pellet was collected by centrifugation, air-dried, and resuspended in 20 μl of S1 nuclease hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 40 mm MOPS, pH 7, 400 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA). The DNA/RNA hybrids were fully denatured at 85 °C for 10 min and subsequently incubated at 42 °C overnight. Then, samples were 10-fold diluted and treated with 1250 units of S1 nuclease (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h in the reaction buffer (300 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 1 mm NaCl, and 10 mm zinc acetate). At the same time, we performed a sequencing reaction of the EhPgp53′-UTR using the EhPgp5-3′-UTR-S primer. The sequencing products and RNA fragments protected of the S1 nuclease digestion were resolved through denaturing 8% PAGE at room temperature, vacuum-dried, and visualized in a PhosphorImager apparatus. Templates for transcript synthesis were prepared from pBluescript II SK (+/−) phagemid (pBS) (Stratagene), which contains the T7 λ phage promoter. The PSI19, PSII118, PSIII156, and PSIV189 DNA fragments that contain the last 100 bp ofEhPgp5 open reading frame and 19, 118, 156, and 189 bp of the 3′-UTR, respectively, were PCR-amplified using 1 unit of Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) and the P4 plasmid (7Descoteaux S. Ayala P. Orozco E. Samuelson J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 54: 201-211Google Scholar) as template. The primers used were EhPgp5-3′-UTR-S sense and the PSI-AS (5′-TTAATATTTATATGAATTA-3′), PSII-AS (5′-TTATTATGAATGATAAATA-3′), PSIII-AS (5′-AAAGAATAAAAACAAACT-3′), and PSIV-AS (5′-TATCATATAACAATTAAA-3′) antisense primers. Amplified products were directionally cloned into the BamHI andXhoI sites of pBS plasmid and sequenced in a ABI PRISM automatic sequencer. Recombinant plasmids (1 μg each) were linearized with XhoI restriction enzyme and in vitrotranscribed with T7 RNA polymerase using 1 mm each NTP, 100 mm dithiothreitol, and 40 units of recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 1 h according to the manufacturer protocol (Promega). Labeled EhPgp53′-UTR RNA fragments were produced by the addition of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the synthesis reaction. Finally, RNase-free DNase (10 units) was added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to remove DNA templates. Labeled RNA probes were purified by Sephadex G50 column filtration. EhPgp5 3′-UTR transcripts length was determined by 12% denaturing PAGE. Cytoplasmic extracts (CE) were obtained as described (33Schreiber E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Google Scholar) with some modifications for E. histolytica. Briefly, 1 × 106 trophozoites of clones C2, C2(90), and C2(225) were washed with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.8, supplemented with 10 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 15 min. Then 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmbenzamidine, 5 μg/ml each aprotinin, pepstatin A, leupeptin, and E-64) were added, and samples were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 min. The supernatant was mixed with 0.11 volume of 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 30 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl solution and centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (34Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). 5 × 105 cpm of each PSI19, PSII118, PSIII156, and PSIV189[α-32P]UTP-labeled probes and 60 μg of CE were separately incubated in the binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 40 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 4 mm spermidine, 5% glycerol) at 4 °C for 15 min in 20 μl of final volume. Subsequently, RNase A + T1 (10 μg + 20 units) (Sigma) were added to the mixture and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then, heparin (5 mg/ml) was added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 10 min. For competition assays, we used a 350-fold molar excess of the PSI19-, PSII118-, PSIII156-, and PSIV189-unlabeled probes. RNA-protein complexes were resolved at 130 V for 4 h on pre-electrophoresed 6% nondenaturing PAGE. Gels were vacuum-dried, and RNA-protein interactions were detected by scanning in a PhosphorImager apparatus. Total RNA was used for ligase-mediated poly(A) test (LM-PAT) according to the method described (35Sallés F.J. Strickland S. PCR Methods Applications. 1995; 4: 317-321Google Scholar). 1 μg of total RNA was incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with 10 units of RNase-free DNase I (Stratagene). Annealing and in situ ligation of 20 ng of oligo(dT18) to the 3′ end of poly(A) tails of total RNA were done at 42 °C for 30 min in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Subsequent annealing of 200 ng of hybrid oligo(dT18)-adapter primer (5′-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGAT18-3′) was done at 12 °C for 2 h. cDNA synthesis was performed using the first-strand buffer, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 200 units of SuperscriptTM II, and recombinant RNasin ribonuclease inhibitor (40 units) at 42 °C for 1 h. PCR was performed using 1/10 volume of the samples and the (5′-CTGAGCTCAGCTGTAGCT-3′) antisense primer complementary to the adapter region of the oligo(dT18)-adapter primer and theEhPgp5-3′-UTR-S sense oligonucleotide. An actin 3′-UTR (5′-GATCAATTCTTGCCTCAT-3′) sense primer was used as a control. Amplification for Ehgp5 and actin genes was done in 30 cycles at 95 °C at 30 s, 59 °C at 35 s, 72 °C at 90 s, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 7 min. PCR samples were separated on a 1.5% Tris-buffered EDTA-agarose gel then transferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with specificEhPgp5 and actin 3′-UTR [α-32P]dATP-labeled probes. To study the mechanisms controlling mRNA decay in E. histolyticawe first investigated the effect of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D on viability, growth, and mRNA synthesis in trophozoites of the drug-sensitive clone A and drug-resistant clone C2. Cell viability of trophozoites of clone C2 incubated 12 h with or without actinomycin D was 98%. At this time cell growth was slightly delayed in the actinomycin d-treated trophozoites in comparison with untreated cells (Fig.1 A). The effect of actinomycin D on cell growth and viability was similar in trophozoites of all clones tested (data not shown). Then we performed experiments to determine whether mRNA synthesis was affected by actinomycin D and the time required to inhibit at least 90% of mRNA synthesis. Results showed that actinomycin D affects the [3H]UTP incorporation into new synthesized RNA in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Untreated trophozoites of clones A and C2 incubated for 2 h (t 0) with [3H]UTP incorporated 16,450 and 14,660 cpm, respectively. Each value was taken as 100% incorporation for the corresponding clone (Fig. 1 B). Trophozoites of clones A and C2 preincubated for 30 min with the drug and then incubated with [3H]UTP for 2 h incorporated 50.4 and 59.9% of radioactivity, respectively. One hour later, both clones presented only 12% incorporation of [3H]UTP (Fig. 1 B). These low levels of RNA synthesis were maintained in trophozoites of both clones incubated with actinomycin D for up to 8 h (Fig. 1 B). As a control for mRNA integrity, equivalent amounts of total RNA were isolated at each time, and rRNA were visualized in ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels (Fig. 1 C). No appreciable changes in the rRNA amount were observed, indicating no significant RNA degradation. These data provided us a temporal window in which the mRNA decay could be analyzed. To investigate the EhPgp5mRNA stability in trophozoites growing with different emetine concentrations, we determined the EhPgp5 mRNA half-life in actinomycin d-treated trophozoites of clones C2, C2(90), and C2(225). EhPgp5 mRNA was measured from 0 to 12 h by semiquantitative RT-PCR assays in total RNA. We included actin primers in all reactions as internal control. Results showed thatEhPgp5 mRNA was present in untreated trophozoites of clone C2, and the signal diminished progressively at 2 and 4 h after the transcriptional blockage (Fig.2 A). In clone C2(90), theEhPgp5 transcript was detected up to 8 h after actinomycin D treatment (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, in clone C2(225) the EhPgp5 mRNA was detected even 12 h after the transcriptional blockage (Fig. 2 C). These data indicated that EhPgp5 mRNA amounts are reduced in a time-dependent manner in actinomycin d-treated trophozoites, but they are maintained for a longer time in the emetine-cultured cells. In contrast, we did not detect theEhPgp5 mRNA in untreated trophozoites of the wild type drug-sensitive clone A (Fig. 2 G), confirming thatEhPgp5 gene is not transcribed in the drug-sensitive trophozoites (36Delgadillo D.M. Perez D.G. Gomez C. Ponce A. Paz F. Bañuelos C. Mendoza L. Lopez C. Orozco E. Microb. Drug Resist. 2002; 8: 15-26Google Scholar). The EhPgp5 and actin mRNAs were quantified by densitometry and arbitrary expressed in pixels (Fig. 2,D–F). Pixels given by actin at t 0were taken as 100% in each clone, and the EhPgp5 percentage was expressed with respect to the actin mRNA levels. Att 0, the actin amount appeared almost unaltered, whereas EhPgp5 varied in the three clones. In trophozoites of clone C2, the EhPgp5 mRNA was 63% of the actin mRNA (Fig. 2 D), and in C2(90) it was 81% (Fig.2 E), whereas clone C2(225) exhibited similar levels of both transcripts (Fig. 2 F). The other bands seen in the gels were not related to the EhPgp5 transcript, as probed by Southern blot hybridization using the EhPgp5 probe (data not shown). To determine the experimental mRNA half-life, the results of normalized EhPgp5 mRNA levels were plotted in a semilogarithmic scale against the exposure time to actinomycin D (Fig.2 H). In these calculations, the amount of EhPgp5and actin mRNA at t 0 was taken as 100% in each clone. In trophozoites of clone C2, the experimentalEhPgp5 mRNA half-life was estimated in 2.1 h, whereas in C2(90) it was 3.1 h and 7.8 h in C2(225), confirming significant variations in the decay rates of the three clones. In addition, these experiments showed that actin mRNA decay remained with minimal changes during the 12-h course of the transcription inhibition in all clones. There are reports proposing that actin mRNA has a half-life between 24 and 33 h in mammalian cells (37Chrzanowska-Lightowlers Z. Preiss T. Lightowlers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27322-27328Google Scholar). According to our experiments, E. histolytica actin mRNA has a half-life longer than 12 h. Experimental values were close to the theoretical EhPgp5mRNA half-life predicted from the decay equation described under “Experimental Procedures.” The theoretical EhPgp5mRNA half-life was 1.2 h in the trophozoites of clone C2, 2.7 h in C2(90), and increased to 5.6 h in C2(225) (Table I).Table ITheoretical and experimental EhPgp5 mRNA half-life in E. histolytica trophozoites of clone C2 grown at different emetine concentrationsTheoretical mRNA half-lifeaAccording to the decay equation:t 1/2 = ln2/K.Experimental mRNA half-lifebAccording to the semilogarithmic data plotted in Fig.2 H.EhPgp5ActinEhPgp5Actin(h)(h)C21.2ND2.1> 12C2 (90)2.7ND3.1> 12C2 (225)5.6ND7.8> 12CANDNDNDNDND, Not determined.a According to the decay equation:t 1/2 = ln2/K.b According to the semilogarithmic data plotted in Fig.2 H. Open table in a new tab ND, Not determined. To determine whether the distinct EhPgp5 mRNA half-lives observed in the trophozoites of clones C2, C2(90), and C2(225) could be influenced by changes in the 3′-UTR length, we performed RNA protection assays with S1 nuclease (Fig. 3 A). Three RNA-DNA-protected fragments were found at nt 118, 156, and 189 downstream of the UAA stop codon of the EhPgp5 mRNA in all C2 clones (Fig. 3 A, lanes 2–4). These fragments, corresponding to different EhPgp5 3′-UTR variants, were denoted as PSII118, PSIII156, and PSIV189, respectively. Interestingly, clone C2(225) showed an extra protected fragment at the nt 19 (PSI19) (Fig. 3 A, arrow). The protected fragments detected were analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 3 B). The total pixels obtained from the transcript species in clone C2(225) were taken as 100%, and those from C2(90) and C2 clones were 53 and 47%, respectively. In clone C2, the PSIV189, PSIII156, and PSII118 variants showed levels of 26, 23, and 31 pixels, respectively (Fig. 3 C). In clone C2(90), PSIV189 and PSIII156 appeared in similar amounts (36 and 34 pixels), whereas PSII118 gave only 21 pixels (Fig. 3 D). In clone C2(225), the transcript PSI19 was 40% of total variants (68 pixels), whereas PSIV189, PSIII156, and PSII118gave 43, 39, and 23 pixels, respectively (Fig. 3 E). In clone C2(225), the PSIII156 and PSIV189 species increased almost 2-fold with respect to PSII118, whereas PSI19 was 3.3-fold, suggesting that they could be more stable (Fig. 3 E). The presence of various polyadenylation sites suggested that mRNA variants could influence the EhPgp5 mRNA steady-state levels, as has been reported for other cells (38Higgins C.F. Causton H.C. Dance G.S.G. Mudd E.A. Belasco J.G. Brawerman G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1993: 13-30Google Scholar, 39Wickens M. Anderson P. Jackson R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 220-232Google Scholar, 40Edwalds-Gilbert G. Veraldi K.L. Milcarek C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2547-2561Google Scholar). Differences in sequence at the 3′-UTR could be involved in the EhPgp5mRNA stability and polyadenylation site selection. The comparative analysis of the first 189 bases in the 3′-UTR EhPgp5 DNA showed that 3′-UTR sequences were identical in clones A, C2 (Fig.4), and C2(225) clones (data not shown), indicating that differences in sequence do not account for theEhPgp5 mRNA half-life or for the polyadenylation site choice. The EhPgp5 3′-UTR is 85% AU-rich, and it presents several putative consensus binding sequences for regulatory proteins. There are five putative consensus polyadenylation signals (PS) with the UA(A/U)UU sequence described for E. histolytica (41Bruchhaus I. Leippe M. Lioutas C. Tannich E. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 925-933Google Scholar) at nt 1, 17, 98, 127, and 174 (Fig. 4, open boxes). We also found several eukaryotic 3′-UTR elements including the canonical polyadenylation signal (AAUAAA) at nt 90 (Fig. 4, shadowbox) and three putative AU-rich elements (AUREs) conformed by the conserved AUUUA sequence (42Chen C.Y. Shyu A.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Google Scholar) at nt 19, 76, and 99 downstream from the UAA codon (Fig. 4, ellipses). In addition, two polypyrimidine tracts (Py) were detected at nt 31–44 and 142–159 (Fig. 4,discontinuous underlined) and a consensus cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), (UUUUUAU) at nt 146–154 (Fig. 4,continuous underlined). The CPE seems to promote cytoplasmic polyadenylation in eukaryotic cells (43Hake L. Mendez R. Ritcher J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 63: 685-693Google Scholar). Alignment of theEhPgp5 3′-UTR full-length with other mdr 3′-UTR sequences revealed a high divergence between 3′-UTRs mdrgene family members (data not shown). Stability of mRNA is also regulated through site-specific binding of cytoplasmic proteins to consensus sequences at the 3′-UTR mRNA. The presence of putative EhPgp5mRNA binding regulatory proteins was investigated by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays using the PSI19, PSII118 PSIII156 and PSIV189fragments as RNA probes (Fig.5 A). The results showed that PSIII156 and PSIV189 transcripts were able to form a RNA-p"
https://openalex.org/W2030101409,"In my youth I was overwhelmed by the variety of forms of life around me. Yes, while growing up in New York City! As a student at the Bronx High School of Science my teachers made every effort to convince me that no pursuit could be more exciting or rewarding than searching for explanations for the basic processes common to life. I agreed, but I knew this decision was insufficient, for I would have to choose the area of science that was just right for me. I was aware that major unanswered questions existed in all fields of science, particularly regarding the relationship of biochemistry to genetics, the two subjects that interested me most as a high school student. I decided to major in biochemistry, and enrolled at the City College of New York. I completed a year and a half of college study before being drafted into the army in the spring of 1944. I served in the infantry as a cannoneer during World War II. I fought in the Ardennes in the Battle of the Bulge. Understandably this was an awesome experience. Upon returning to college after the war I was more determined than ever to pursue a career in research. When faced with selecting a Ph.D. program to apply to, I received excellent advice from a knowledgeable professor and textbook author, Benjamin Harrow, chairman of the Biochemistry Department at City College of New York. He suggested exploring gene-enzyme relationships with Neurospora crassa as the ideal project for me. I agreed and applied to do my graduate work with George Beadle at Caltech or Edward Tatum at Yale. I was rejected by Caltech but fortunately was accepted by Yale. As it turned out, my mentor in graduate school at Yale was not Edward Tatum; it was David Bonner. Bonner had moved with Tatum from Stanford to Yale and had become his research associate. During the year I applied for admission to Yale, Tatum decided to return to Stanford. Fortunately for me, Bonner stayed on at Yale and took over direction of Tatum's remaining group. Bonner, a wonderful advisor, believed it was in the best interests of both student and advisor to have each student work independently on a well defined project. If successful, he said, we would receive partial credit for our discoveries and would qualify for a faculty position. For most beginning graduate students, selecting a project and deciding how to proceed is relegated to your research mentor and would reflect his or her research preferences. By choosing a specific scientist as your advisor you recognize the importance of his or her contributions. In my initial meeting with Bonner at Yale in June of 1948, as I recall, he handed me a fuzzy culture of a niacin-requiring mutant of Neurospora and gave me advice on how to go about identifying the niacin pathway intermediate this mutant was presumed to accumulate. Our ultimate goal, he said, was identifying all the intermediates in the niacin pathway so this knowledge could be exploited in investigations on gene-enzyme relationships. I was the only laboratory member assigned this type of project, probably because Bonner was aware that my background was principally in biochemistry. This project captured my full attention, and fortunately, I was successful. We identified two intermediates accumulated by niacin-requiring mutants, quinolinic acid and a derivative of kynurenine. The knowledge I acquired in these studies served as a valuable resource in decision making throughout the early stages of my career. Upon reviewing my research accomplishments and considering what I might emphasize in this article, I was most impressed by the variety of basic biological questions the members of my group have addressed. Early in my career I decided that one of my primary research objectives would be to provide a thorough understanding of all aspects of tryptophan metabolism and to use this knowledge in explaining basic processes of biology. In fact, tryptophan metabolism was the focus of most of my research. However, during the early stages of my career I did not appreciate the variety of scientific questions that I would have the opportunity to address using tryptophan metabolism as my experimental system. Our studies contributed to knowledge on the niacin and tryptophan biosynthetic pathways, enzyme structure/function relationships, organization of genes and operons, the existence of gene-protein colinearity, the molecular basis of suppression, coupling of transcription with translation, regulation of transcription, how tryptophan and tryptophan-tRNA serve as regulatory signals, and the regulatory mechanisms microorganisms use to control tryptophan synthesis and its degradation. The unanticipated role of RNA in regulation, transcription attenuation, was and continues to be one of our major interests. We had no inkling until the 1990s, when bacterial genomes were beginning to be sequenced, that attenuation was so widely used in nature. While we were conducting our investigations on tryptophan metabolism evolutionary questions continually arose. As soon as we understood the features of tryptophan metabolism in one organism we wished to know whether other organisms use the same genes, reactions, and regulatory processes. Despite my personal commitment to tryptophan metabolism, in the early 1980s I returned to studies withN. crassa as an experimental organism, addressing other important questions. The lesson to be learned from my experiences, I believe, is to always be on the alert. Important unanswered questions you never anticipated will invariably arise from the results of your current research. It may develop that your chosen experimental system is ideal for answering these questions. Throughout this article I will describe examples taken from my career, where answers led to questions I felt we should address. When I arrived at Yale 1n 1948 most members of the Bonner group were coping with the most significant question then concerning the Neurospora scientific community: how to establish the nature of the gene-enzyme relationship. It was some years after Beadle and Tatum (1Beadle G.W. Tatum E.L. Genetic control of biochemical reactions in Neurospora..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1941; 27: 499-506Google Scholar) had first proposed the one gene, one enzyme, one biochemical reaction hypothesis. Following the pioneering studies of Garrod in the early 1900s, linking heredity with metabolism, there were numerous observations relating metabolic defects with genetic disorders. Beadle and Tatum cemented this relationship in the early 1940s by selecting an organism, N. crassa, that could be used to isolate nutritional mutants. These mutants could then be genetically characterized to establish whether their inability to carry out specific biochemical reactions was because of mutations in specific genes. Most importantly, they observed that there was a one to one relationship between gene and biochemical reaction. Despite these findings, when I was completing my graduate studies in 1951 most scientists were skeptical of the validity of the one gene-one enzyme concept. At this time very little was known about the molecular nature and structure of genetic material or the structure of proteins, and virtually nothing was known about protein synthesis. It was not until the early 1950s that the findings of Hershey and Chase (2Hershey A.D. Chase M. Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acids in growth of bacteriophage..J. Gen. Physiol. 1952; 36: 39-56Google Scholar) and an earlier finding by Avery et al. (3Avery O.T. MacLeod C.M. McCarty M. Studies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types..J. Exp. Med. 1944; 79: 137-157Google Scholar) convinced most of us that genetic material was most likely DNA, and it was not until 1953 that Jim Watson and Francis Crick (4Watson J.D. Crick F.H.C. Molecular structure of nucleic acids..Nature. 1953; 171: 737-738Google Scholar) described their elegant structure for DNA. Following these major contributions we accepted as proven that the genetic material of most organisms was double-stranded DNA. Furthermore, it was not until the late 1950s that Seymour Benzer's (5Benzer S. The elementary units of heredity. In The Chemical Basis of Heredity. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, MD1957: 70-93Google Scholar) fine structure genetic analyses with the rII locus of phage T4 equated the genetic map with the structure of DNA. Similarly, it was not until the early 1950s that Sanger's studies (6Sanger F. The arrangement of amino acids in proteins..Adv. Protein Chem. 1952; 7: 1-28Google Scholar) with insulin established that proteins consist of linear sequences of amino acids. While I was in graduate school the goal considered most important by members of the Beadle-Tatum school was to identify a specific enzymatic reaction for which defective mutants could be isolated and then determine whether these mutants lacked that enzymatic activity. Our hope was that studies like these would provide definitive proof for the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis. Several members of the Bonner group were following this approach. Naomi Franklin, Otto Landman, Gabriel Lester, and Howard Rickenberg were examining one of the most popular experimental enzymes during this period, β-galactosidase, from bothNeurospora and Escherichia coli. They were hoping to use the knowledge and techniques being provided by Monod, and subsequently by Jacob and Monod and their exceptional coworkers, to explore the Beadle-Tatum gene-enzyme concept more directly. Impressed by this overriding goal of my mentor and the determination of my fellow students, I decided that I too should follow this path. In my third and last year of graduate study, 1950–1951, I abandoned my niacin pathway studies and initiated a search for the ideal “gene-enzyme” experimental system. No one in our group at Yale was contemplating what today would be considered the most obvious experimental approach: isolating and sequencing a specific gene and comparing this sequence with the amino acid sequence of its polypeptide product. Neither genes nor proteins could be analyzed in this way; we did not yet know that genetic material was DNA or that proteins consisted of linear sequences of amino acids. At this time the prevailing view in the field of genetics was that chromosomes consist of linear arrays of genes arranged like “beads on a string.” It was assumed that each gene was indivisible by genetic recombination. If these views were correct how could we determine the relative positions of independent mutational changes in a specific gene, except by structural analysis, which was not possible? We decided that our next step on the gene-enzyme problem should be to demonstrate convincingly that all mutants altered at a single genetic locus lack the specific enzyme that catalyzes the corresponding reaction. By the late 1940s numerous nutritional mutants of N. crassahad been isolated, many requiring the same metabolite. It was evident that amino acids, vitamins, purines, and pyrimidines are all synthesized by sequential enzyme-catalyzed reactions, mostly in separate pathways. However, these pathways were just beginning to be defined. Genetic analyses with these mutants established a very impressive one-to-one relationship between altered gene and loss of a specific biochemical reaction; this was the experimental basis of the Beadle/Tatum concept. It was also evident that a unique set of genes was associated with each metabolic pathway. However, very few of the enzymes in each newly discovered pathway had been identified, and those that were known did not catalyze reactions that were defective in the nutritional mutants that had been isolated. One of the earliest opportunities to examine mutants lacking a specific enzyme was provided by the findings of Umbreit et al. in 1946 (7Umbreit W.W. Wood W.A. Gunsalus I.C. The activity of pyridoxal phosphate in tryptophan formation by cell-free enzyme preparations..J. Biol. Chem. 1946; 165: 731-732Google Scholar). They demonstrated that extracts of wild type Neurospora contain an enzyme they named tryptophan desmolase, which catalyzes the last reaction in tryptophan synthesis, the covalent joining of indole withl-serine to form l-tryptophan. Tryptophan-requiring mutants of Neurospora had been identified that could not grow on indole; therefore these mutants should lack this enzyme activity if the Beadle/Tatum hypothesis were correct. Joseph Lein and Dave Hogness, of Hershell Mitchell's laboratory at Caltech, examined extracts of one such mutant, namedtd1, and reported that yes, it did lack tryptophan desmolase activity (8Mitchell H.K. Lein J. A Neurospora mutant deficient in the enzymatic synthesis of tryptophan..J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 175: 481-482Google Scholar, 9Hogness D.S. Mitchell H.K. Genetic factors influencing the activity of tryptophan desmolase in Neurospora crassa..J. Gen. Microbiol. 1954; 11: 401-411Google Scholar). Having spent my first 2 years studying niacin and tryptophan metabolism in Neurospora, I decided that tryptophan desmolase was promising as a potential subject for gene-enzyme analyses. I initiated my studies by partially purifying and further characterizing the wild type enzyme and confirming the absence of tryptophan desmolase activity in extracts of mutant td1. I also examined a second mutant altered at the same locus, mutant td2, and showed that it too lacked tryptophan desmolase activity (10Yanofsky C. The effects of gene change on tryptophan desmolase formation..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1952; 38: 215-226Google Scholar). Excited by the simplicity of this enzyme assay and these positive results, members of the Bonner group turned to isolating 20 additional mutants defective in the conversion of indole to tryptophan. We showed that each was genetically altered at the td locus and each lacked tryptophan desmolase activity. These initial findings were very encouraging, and they supported the basic assumption of the Beadle/Tatum concept. In the course of my studies with mutant td2 one culture grew in media lacking tryptophan. Instead of discarding this culture, we analyzed it genetically and discovered that its ability to grow without tryptophan was due to an unlinked suppressor mutation. The properties of this suppressed td mutant raised a new, then unanswerable, question. How does a suppressor mutation, a mutation in a gene other than the td gene, restore growth without tryptophan? My enzyme analyses revealed that the suppressor mutation acted by restoring the organism's ability to form an active tryptophan desmolase (10Yanofsky C. The effects of gene change on tryptophan desmolase formation..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1952; 38: 215-226Google Scholar). Probing still further, I observed that thetd2 suppressor gene was allele-specific; it had no effect on mutant td1. Obviously, then, mutants td1 andtd2 must have different alterations at the tdlocus. We next performed “reversion” analyses with all ourtd mutants and isolated several additional suppressors. Most of these restored tryptophan desmolase activity only when combined with their respective td mutant allele. On the basis of these findings we rephrased our previous question, as follows. If there is a one-to-one relationship between gene and enzyme and only td mutants lack tryptophan desmolase activity, how does a mutation in a gene distinct from the td locus restore this enzyme activity? My thoughts on possible explanations temporarily diverted attention from my primary objective, establishing the basis of the one gene-one enzyme relationship. I considered our suppression findings to be extremely interesting and believed that their explanation might provide additional insight into this relationship. This experience, I believe, was largely responsible for many of my subsequent decisions on how to proceed in planning future research. I decided then that our knowledge of basic biological processes was so poor it would be foolish to ignore interesting unexplained observations. Following this line of reasoning I set out to compare the properties of tryptophan desmolase isolated from the wild type strain and from several suppressed mutants. Throughout this period we were frustrated at how little we could do experimentally. The existing molecular technology was clearly inadequate. With a close friend and former member of the Bonner group, Sigmund Suskind, then a postdoctoral fellow performing immunological research at another institution, we designed a different approach that we thought might provide additional insight into the gene-enzyme relationship, The question we set out to answer was the following.Does suppressible mutant td2, but not non-suppressible mutant td1, produce an inactive form of the tryptophan desmolase enzyme?Using my partially purified wild type enzyme as antigen, Suskind prepared a rabbit antiserum that inhibited wild type tryptophan desmolase activity. We used this antiserum in a successful weekend experiment at Yale, analyzing extracts of mutants td1 andtd2 for an inactive tryptophan desmolase-like protein that would cross-react with our antiserum (11Suskind S.R. Yanofsky C. Bonner D.M. Allelic strains of Neurospora lacking tryptophan synthetase: a preliminary immunochemical characterization..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1955; 41: 577-582Google Scholar). Mutant td2extracts did in fact contain such a cross-reacting material, for which we coined the term “CRM,” whereas extracts of mutant td1did not. Comparable analyses were then performed with extracts of our other td mutants. All our suppressible mutants were shown to be CRM+, whereas all our non-suppressible mutants were CRM−. These findings implied, incorrectly, that suppression can restore a functional enzyme only if a mutant produces an inactive form of the wild type enzyme. (There are several reasonable explanations for our inability to isolate suppressors of our CRM− Neurospora mutants, which probably had chain termination mutations in the td gene.) On the basis of our findings I drew a number of interesting conclusions. I presented these at a very exciting symposium entitled “Enzymes, Units of Biological Structure and Function” held at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit in 1955 (Fig.1) (12Yanofsky C. Gene interactions in enzyme synthesis..in: Henry Ford Hospital International Symposium: Enzymes, Units of Biological Structure and Function. Academic Press Inc., New York1956: 147-160Google Scholar). My interpretations were of course influenced by new knowledge on DNA and protein structure and the mechanism of protein synthesis. I concluded that “the tdlocus is the only chromosomal area which directly controls tryptophan synthetase formation” (the accepted name had just been changed from desmolase to synthetase). I also concluded that “the tdlocus represents a physiologically indivisible unit, damage to any part of which results in a defect in tryptophan synthetase formation.” I stated that “it would seem likely that different portions of thetd locus are concerned with the synthesis of different parts of the tryptophan synthetase molecule.” In attempting to explain how a suppressor mutation restores enzyme activity I postulated that “some product of a suppressor gene cooperates with the altered template in the formation of small amounts of tryptophan synthetase.” Looking back on these interpretations, they were all naive guesses, but they proved to be correct. Unfortunately the experimental tools and approaches needed to establish their molecular validity were not available. These studies on missense suppression preceded the enormous interest in suppression aroused by studies on the genetic code and on nonsense mutations. As is so often the case, the significance of a finding is not appreciated until additional relevant knowledge is acquired. At this stage in my career I was deeply committed to doing everything I could to provide additional insight into the gene-enzyme relationship. I was disappointed at the difficulty I was experiencing attempting to purify the tryptophan synthetase of Neurosporaand initiated a search for a more suitable experimental enzyme. My first thought was to identify an enzyme in the tryptophan to niacin pathway from E. coli or Bacillus subtilis, because these organisms were developing as more ideal experimental subjects for biochemical analyses. I performed radioisotope-labeling experiments with these two organisms, hoping to show that one or both synthesizes niacin from tryptophan. My findings provided a disappointing conclusion; neither organism synthesizes niacin from tryptophan (13Yanofsky C. The absence of a tryptophan-niacin relationship in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis..J. Bacteriol. 1954; 68: 577-584Google Scholar). This negative result eliminated enzymes of the niacin pathway from my list of possibilities. While performing these studies I was offered a faculty position in the outstanding Microbiology Department at the Western Reserve University School of Medicine. I decided to accept their offer and left Yale for Cleveland in 1954. As a beginning Assistant Professor I felt it would be wiser to shift my research objectives to a well defined problem, one for which I could foresee obtaining definitive answers. I relied on my prior scientific experience and chose determining the missing reactions in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway. Although many different classes of tryptophan auxotrophs had been isolated in Neurospora,E. coli, and other organisms, only two intermediates in the tryptophan pathway had been identified, anthranilate and indole. I chose an enzymological approach in attempting to identify the intermediates in the pathway and initiated my studies by analyzing extracts of wild type and different classes of tryptophan auxotrophs ofE. coli. My efforts focused on unidentified intermediates in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway were successful. Using an enzymological approach we succeeded where others who had employed in vivoapproaches had failed. The principal reason for this is that the unidentified intermediates in the tryptophan pathway are all phosphorylated. Phosphorylated intermediates accumulated in vivo would have been dephosphorylated and therefore inactive when fed to a mutant. With the aid of my graduate student Oliver Smith, the following intermediates were identified: phosphoribosyl anthranilate, carboxyphenylamino-1-deoxyribulose 5-phosphate, and indole-3-glycerol phosphate (IGP). The initial precursor of the tryptophan pathway, chorismic acid, was isolated and identified by Frank Gibson, working with his own group in Australia. Chorismate also serves as precursor of the other aromatic amino acids. With the identification of these additional compounds, the precursor and all the intermediates in the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway were known. While conducting these studies I made an unanticipated observation that subsequently proved to be of enormous benefit in our colinearity studies. I observed that many tryptophan auxotrophs of E. coli, when cultured on growth-limiting levels of tryptophan, produced 20–50 times more tryptophan synthetase than the wild type strain. I thought that the day might come, as it did, when I could exploit this observation to overproduce mutant proteins for purification and analysis. I was aware of the regulatory significance of this observation and concluded that ultimately we should address the regulatory mechanism(s) responsible for this increase. Despite this temporary diversion in the mid-1950s, I was still committed to establishing the nature of the gene-enzyme relationship. Knowledge about genes, proteins, and protein synthesis was improving, so much so that the gene-enzyme relationship was redefined. The question had matured to the following. Is the nucleotide sequence of a gene colinear with the amino acid sequence of the corresponding protein? During this period we learned many new facts about tryptophan synthetase. I thought it might prove to be an ideal enzyme for addressing the colinearity question. Our continuing investigations with this enzyme, from both Neurospora and E. coli, suggested that it may catalyze the last two reactions in tryptophan formation, the cleavage of IGP to indole and the coupling of indole with serine to form tryptophan. However, there were two observations we could not explain: free indole could not be detected as an intermediate in the conversion of IGP to tryptophan, and the rate of conversion of IGP to indole was lower than its rate of conversion to tryptophan (14Yanofsky C. Rachmeler M. The exclusion of free indole as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of tryptophan in Neurospora crassa..Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 28: 641-642Google Scholar). We then had to ask the following question. Does the enzyme catalyze a third reaction in which IGP and serine react with one another to form tryptophan, or is indole truly the intermediate, and it remains within the enzyme complex? This puzzle was not satisfactorily solved until the late 1980s. Then, the elegant structural solution for the α2β2 tryptophan synthase (name changed again) enzyme complex of Salmonellaby Hyde et al. (15Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 multienzyme complex from Salmonella typhimurium..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Google Scholar) revealed that there is a physical tunnel in this enzyme complex connecting the active site of one polypeptide subunit, α, where indole is produced from IGP, to an active site of the second subunit, β2, where indole reacts withl-serine to form l-tryptophan (15Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. Three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 multienzyme complex from Salmonella typhimurium..J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Google Scholar, 16Miles E.W. Biswas B.B. Roy S. Tryptophan synthase: structure, function, and protein engineering. In Subcellular Biochemistry, Proteins: Structure, Function, and Protein Engineering. 24. Plenum Press, New York1995: 207-254Google Scholar). As you might imagine, it was comforting to have our confusing early observations explained unambiguously by structural and enzymatic studies. At this stage in my career everything was going well for me at Western Reserve Medical School. I had quality co-workers and I thoroughly enjoyed my interactions with my fellow faculty members, Howard Gest, John Spizizen, David Novelli, Bob Greenberg, and Abe Stavitsky. However, in 1957 I was contacted by Victor Twitty, chairman of the Department of Biological Sciences at Stanford University, and offered a faculty position. Despite my initial disinterest in considering this appointment, I accepted their offer for a variety of reasons, including my learning that Arthur Kornberg's department would be moving to the Stanford campus (to the Stanford Medical School, which was being relocated from San Francisco). Of historical interest, when I arrived at Stanford the laboratory space I was provided was in the basement of old Jordan Hall and was the space previously occupied by Ed Tatum and his research team. I truly was treading in Tatum's footsteps! When setting up my laboratory at Stanford in January of 1958, I decided that the time had come to mount an all out effort to establish or disprove gene-protein colinearity. I was joined in this project by an outstanding young postdoctoral fellow, Irving Crawford, who was recommended to me by Arthur Kornberg. In his exploratory studies with tryptophan synthetase from E. coli, Irving was first to establish that the enzyme is a complex composed of non-identical polypeptide chains. One subunit, TrpA (TSase α), hydrolyzes IGP to indole, whereas the second subunit, TrpB (TSase β2), covalently joins indole and l-serine to forml-tryptophan (17Crawford I.P. Yanofsky C. On the separation of the tryptophan synthetase of Escherichia coli into two protein components..Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 1161-1170Google Scholar). However, the enzyme fromNeurospora is a single polypeptide chain. In what proved to be an extremely valuable observation for our subsequent colinearity studies, Irving found that each E. coli subunit activates the other subunit in the reaction that subunit performs alone. This finding suggested that we might be able to detect and assay each inactive TrpA mutant protein enzymatically by measuring its ability to activate the TrpB subunit in the indole plus serine to tryptophan reaction. This expectation proved to be correct; we routinely assayed each mutant TrpA protein during its purification by measuring its activation of TrpB. We next prepared a set of pure mutant TrpA proteins, each presumably with a single inactivating amino acid change. Good fortune helped us again, for in 1958 Vernon Ingram described an elegant method, “peptide fingerprinting,” which he had used to detect peptides with single amino acid changes in mutant human hemoglobins (18Ingram V.M. Abnormal human hemoglobins. 1. The comparison of normal human and sickle-cell hemoglobins by fingerprinting..Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1958; 28: 539-545Google Scholar). This approach seemed ideal for what we wished to do. If we could identify the single amino acid change in each of our mutant proteins we would then only have to compare the positions of these amino acid changes in TrpA with the order of the corresponding altered sites on a fine structure genetic map of the trpA gene to prove or disprove gene-protein colinearity. I knew that we could construct a fine structure genetic map of trpA using phage P1, based on a previous genetic study I performed with Ed Lennox (19Yanofsky C. Lennox E.S.

To elucidate whether the cleavage site specificities of γ-secretase leading to the formation of secreted and intracellular Aβ are identical, we made use of point mutations close to the γ-cleavage site, known to have a dramatic effect on the 42/40 ratio of secreted Aβ. We found that the selected point mutations only marginally influenced the 42/40 ratio of intracellular Aβ, suggesting differences in the γ-secretase cleavage site specificity for the generation of secreted and intracellular Aβ. The analysis of the subcellular compartments involved in the generation of intracellular Aβ revealed that Aβ is not generated in the early secretory pathway in the human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. In this study we identified late Golgi compartments to be involved in the generation of intracellular Aβ. Moreover, we demonstrate that the presence of processed PS1 is not sufficient to obtain γ-secretase processing of the truncated amyloid precursor protein construct C99, proposing the existence of an additional factor downstream of the endoplasmic reticulum and early Golgi required for the formation of an active γ-secretase complex.

However, it has also been reported that Aβ42 is produced in different organelles later in the secretory pathway and that the ER is not the major intracellular site of Aβ42 generation (26Martin B.L.

Additionally, recent work has suggested that the Aβ42 generation in the ER may be independent of PS (35Wilson C.A. Doms R.W. Zheng H. Lee V.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 849-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Therefore, the exact site of intracellular Aβ generation and the subcellular compartments in which PS promotes Aβ generation remain so far unclear. Furthermore, little is known about the cleavage site specificity of the γ-secretase responsible for the generation of intracellular Aβ, which may play a central part in the pathogenesis of AD. In the present study we examined the cleavage site specificity of intracellular γ-secretase as well as the subcellular compartments in which the direct Aβ precursor C99 (36Lichtenthaler S.F. Multhaup G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) is processed by γ-secretase to intracellular Aβ. To address the cleavage site specificity of γ-secretase we made use of point mutations close to the γ-cleavage site known to have a dramatic effect on the 42/40 ratio of secreted Aβ (37Suzuki N. Cheung T.T. Cai X.D. Odaka A. Otvos Jr., L. Eckman C. Golde T.E. Younkin S.G. Science. 1994; 264: 1336-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar, 38Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H.

A. 1999; 96: 3053-3058Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and determined their effect on the 42/40 ratio of intracellular Aβ. We found that these mutations only marginally influenced the 42/40 ratio of intracellular Aβ, indicating that the cleavage site specificity of intracellular γ-secretase is less affected by point mutations close to the γ-cleavage site. To investigate the compartments involved in γ-secretase processing, we used different experimental strategies including treatments with organelle-specific toxins and expression of C99 proteins directed to different cellular compartments as well as subcellular fractionation. Our results show that generation of intracellular Aβ was eliminated when C99 was retained in the ER and early Golgi despite the presence of processed endogenous PS1, indicating that PS1 is not sufficient to mediate γ-secretase processing in the early secretory pathway. Instead, we obtained several lines of evidence that an active γ-secretase complex is located in late Golgi compartments. Plasmids pBS/SPLEC99-WT, -I45F, and -V50F were generated as described (38Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Equal volumes of conditioned media and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) and the antibodies W02, G2-10, and G2-11, respectively (concentrations see above). The immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on 12% Tris-Tricine gels (45Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar) or commercial 10–20% Tricine gels (Invitrogen). Western blot analysis was performed with the antibody W02 (1 μg/ml) (42Ida N.

Stably transfected SH-SY5Y cells were preincubated with brefeldin A (BFA) (10 μg/ml, Sigma) or monensin (5 μm, Sigma) for 1.5 h followed by a 10-h incubation period in the presence of the drugs in fresh medium. After 1.5 h of preincubation in methionine-free minimum essential Eagle's medium (Sigma) in the presence or absence of BFA (10 μg/ml), C99 WT-transfected SH-SY5Y cells were incubated for 6 h in methionine-free nonessential amino acid solution containing 5% fetal calf serum and 133 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) in the presence or absence of BFA (10 μg/ml).

Postnuclear membranes were applied onto a continuous sucrose gradient (0.2–2 m) and 17 1-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient after centrifugation overnight at 100,000 × gav (27,000 rpm, Beckman SW 28.1 rotor). Individual fractions were diluted into 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 0,15 m NaCl, and membranes were sedimented by centrifugation for 1 h at 80,000 rpm in a MLA-80 rotor (Beckman). The final membrane pellets were re-suspended in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 5% glycerol and stored at −80 °C until further use. Equal aliquots of each fraction were adjusted 2% CHAPSO and 0.5% CHAPSO for detection of Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides, respectively. Membrane-associated Aβ peptides were released by incubation for 20 min at 37 °C and measured by an electrochemiluminescence assay as described (10Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. Di Muzio-Mower J.

Nonspecific background signal was determined by using non-biotinylated capture antibody 4G8 in the presence of ruthenylated detection antibodies G2-10/G2-11 and subtracted.

Far less is known about the cleavage site specificity of the γ-secretase responsible for the generation of intracellular Aβ (Aβi). To investigate the cleavage site specificity of intracellular γ-secretase, we selected two point mutations close to the γ-cleavage site (Fig. 1), known to have a strong effect on the 42/40 ratio of secreted Aβ (Aβsec42/40). These are the point mutations I45F and V50F, which have been identified by phenylalanine-scanning mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain of APP (38Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N.

Consistent with previously published data for non-neuronal cells (38Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R. Grimm H. Uljon S.N. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

C99 I45F is mainly processed to secreted Aβ ending residue 42 (Aβsec42) (Fig.2A), resulting in a dramatic increase of the Aβsec42/40 ratio compared with C99 WT (relative ratio, 20.4 ± 3.6 (I45F), p < 0.001, n = 6) (Fig.2C) (Table I). In contrast, the V50F mutation is mainly cleaved after amino acid residue 40 (Fig. 2A), causing a decrease of the Aβsec42/40 ratio compared with C99 WT (relative ratio, 0.3 ± 0.1 (V50F),p < 0.001, n = 6) (Fig. 2C) (Table I).

A nullcysteine analogue of PLB, containing isotope labels in the transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic domain, was reconstituted into membranes in the absence and presence of the SERCA1 isoform of Ca2+-ATPase for structural investigation by cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR. PLB lowered the maximal hydrolytic activity of SERCA1 and its affinity for calcium in membrane preparations suitable for structural analysis by NMR. Novel backbone amide proton-deuterium exchange CP-MAS NMR experiments on the two PLB analogues co-reconstituted with SERCA1 indicated that labeled residues Leu42 and Leu44 were situated well within the membrane interior, whereas Pro21 and Ala24 lie exposed outside the membrane. Internuclear distance measurements on PLB using rotational resonance NMR indicated that the sequences Pro21–Ala24 and Leu42–Leu44 adopt an α-helical structure in pure lipid bilayers, which is unchanged in the presence of Ca2+-ATPase. By contrast, rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) NMR experiments revealed that the sequence Ala24–Gln26 switches from an α-helix in pure lipid membranes to a more extended structure in the presence of SERCA1, which may reflect local structural distortions which change the orientations of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. These results suggest that Ca2+-ATPase has a long-range effect on the structure of PLB around residue 25, which promotes the functional association of the two proteins.

Ueno A. Kitano K. Tanaka S. Kadoma M. Tada M. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The primary physiological function of PLB is to regulate the active transport of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum lumen via an inhibitory association with SERCA2a, the cardiac isoform of Ca2+-ATPase (2Tada M. Inui M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 3Simmerman H.K.B. Jones L.R. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 921-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). PLB is believed to bind to the calcium-free conformation of SERCA2a (4Mahaney J.E. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1306-1323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and exerts its inhibitory action by reducing the apparent calcium affinity of the enzyme (5Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In response to β-adrenergic stimulation, PLB is phosphorylated at Ser16 and Thr17 by cAMP-dependent kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase, respectively. PLB phosphorylation relieves SERCA2a inhibition, which increases the rate of calcium uptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and results in the accelerated relaxation of cardiac muscle (2Tada M. Inui M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1983; 15: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Mechanistic failures in the reversibility of SERCA2a inhibition, or overexpression of PLB relative to SERCA2a, are linked to the disruption of calcium homeostasis in cardiac cells and may contribute to cardiovascular disorders such as congestive heart failure (6Schmidt A.G. Edes I. Kranias E.G. Cardiovasc. Drugs Ther. 2001; 15: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The exact nature of the interaction between PLB and SERCA enzymes is a subject of debate. PLB readily self-associates to form a homopentamer within the lipid bilayer (7Wegener A.D. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1834-1841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with a dynamic equilibrium believed to exist between the oligomeric and monomeric state of the protein (9Cornea R.L. Jones L.R. Autry J.M. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2960-2967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Most evidence suggests that it is the monomeric form of PLB that binds to and inhibits SERCA, with the pentamer acting as a reservoir from which monomers dissociate (5Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In reconstitution studies, the molar stoichiometry of PLB to SERCA required for maximal regulation of calcium transport is between 3:1 and 15:1 (12Reddy L.G. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Cala S.E. Obrian J.J. Tatulian S.A. Stokes D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas a fluorescence energy transfer study has suggested that two PLB monomers interact with two Ca2+ATPase molecules to form a heterodimer (14Yao Q. Chen L.T.L. Li J.H. Brungardt K. Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6406-6413Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the latter study, it was found that both PLB molecules must be phosphorylated in order to restore the activity of the calcium pump. In mutational studies, Asahi et al. (15Asahi M. Green N.M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10061-10066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) produced functional and physical data to show that PLB interacts with the transmembrane helix M6 of Ca2+-ATPase. By contrast, co-crystallization studies have led to the proposal that a single PLB monomer interacts asymmetrically with two SERCA molecules such that the transmembrane domain of PLB lies close to the M3 helix of SERCA (16Young H.S. Jones L.R. Stokes D.L. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 884-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In support of the latter argument, thiol cross-linking analysis demonstrated that PLB residue 30 is in close proximity to Cys318 in helix M4 of Ca2+ATPase (17Jones L.R. Cornea R.L. Chen Z.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28319-28329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hence, there is still disagreement over the actual interaction sites between PLB and SERCA. The mechanism for the reversal of SERCA2a inhibition is not fully understood. Although it is clear that phosphorylation of PLB restores SERCA activity, the process does not necessarily involve dissociation of PLB from the enzyme. Rather, the reactivation of the calcium pump may involve a structural rearrangement of PLB at the protein-protein interface (18Negash S. Yao Q. Sun H.Y. Li J.H. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 19Asahi M. McKenna E. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15034-15038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Indeed, provided SERCA is in a calcium-free state, the interactions between it and PLB remain stable, and dissociation of the two proteins occurs only under conditions of elevated Ca2+ (19Asahi M. McKenna E. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15034-15038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition to contacts with M6, further mutational studies have demonstrated an interaction site between PLB domain IB (residues 17–32) and the L67 loop region of Ca2+ATPase, which links helices M6 and M7 (15Asahi M. Green N.M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10061-10066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of PLB may lead to disruption in this region while leaving other interactions intact (15Asahi M. Green N.M. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10061-10066Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the finding that an N27A PLB mutant, although having a normal pentamer to monomer equilibrium, results in super-inhibition of SERCA, which is not relieved by phosphorylation. The conformational alterations generated by the N27A mutation must prevent phosphorylation from overcoming the inhibitory interactions between PLB and SERCA and thus highlights the importance of this region (20Zhai J. Schmidt A.G. Hoit B.D. Kimura Y. MacLennan D.H. Kranias E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10538-10544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). There remains no clear consensus on the three-dimensional structure of PLB in phospholipid membranes, and the protein is probably structurally sensitive to environmental conditions and to its oligomeric and phosphorylation states. It is generally agreed that the protein structure comprises a largely helical cytoplasmic domain (1a), a helical transmembrane domain (II), and a structurally variable domain (Ib) containing a putative hinge site. NMR studies of PLB in solution have shown that the protein is predominantly α-helical but is disrupted by a kink in the polypeptide backbone around Pro21, which may act as a hinge between the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains (21Pollesello P. Annila A. Ovaska M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1784-1795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Lamberth S. Schmid H. Muenchbach M. Vorherr T. Krebs J. Carafoli E. Griesinger C. Helv. Chim. Acta. 2000; 83: 2141-2152Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Solid-state NMR studies have provided local details of the molecular structure of PLB when reconstituted into lipid membranes that mimic the physiological environment of the protein. Selective 13C–13C and 13C–15N interatomic distances along the backbone of wild-type PLB have been measured using the cross-polarization magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) NMR techniques, rotational echo double resonance (REDOR) and rotational resonance (23Smith S.O. Kawakami T. Liu W. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The measurements suggested that the wild-type protein, which is predominantly pentameric, is a continuous α-helix, even across the region containing the putative proline hinge (23Smith S.O. Kawakami T. Liu W. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1139-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, a recent 15N solid-state NMR study of a null-cysteine PLB analogue in uniaxially aligned lipid bilayers has shown that the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the protein are approximately perpendicular to each other (24Mascioni A. Karim C. Zamoon J. Thomas D.D. Veglia G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 9392-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Such a structure supports the existence of a hinge region in which the protein backbone deviates from a continuous α-helical structure. The striking structural differences observed in the two solid-state NMR studies suggest that PLB may undergo conformational transitions as it moves between monomeric and pentameric states. The structure of PLB when associated with Ca2+-ATPase is not known, but a recent fluorescence quenching and time-resolved anisotropy study on a fluorophore-derivatized mutant of PLB has shown that free and ATPase-bound PLB have distinct structures and motional characteristics (25Chen B. Bigelow D.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13965-13972Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In the light of these recent structural insights (21Pollesello P. Annila A. Ovaska M. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 1784-1795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 23Smith S.O. Kawakami T. Liu W. Ziliox M. Aimoto S. J. Mol.

Soc. 2002; 124: 9392-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), this work has examined how and where the structure of PLB is affected by its interactions with Ca2+-ATPase, using CP-MAS NMR as a non-perturbing technique to measure interatomic distances within PLB in ATPase-active membranes. Membranes containing null-cysteine, monomeric PLB, and the fasttwitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1) isoform of Ca2+-ATPase were prepared containing the proteins in suitable concentrations for NMR analysis and in which PLB demonstrably regulated ATPase activity. For the NMR analysis two phospholamban samples (PLBI and PLBII) were prepared containing 13C and 15N labels at selective sites in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 1). The membrane topology and structure of PLB around the labeled sites was elucidated using a combination of CP-MAS NMR methods to measure linear through-space distances between the labels. New insights into the regulatory mechanism of PLB were gained by comparing the structural details for PLB in Ca2+-ATPase-free membranes with its structure in the presence of Ca2+-ATPase. The accumulation of structural information will be important in the long term for understanding the molecular basis for cardiac disorders such as congestive heart failure. Materials—Synthetic PLB was purchased from the Department of Biochemistry, University of Southampton. The three cysteine residues (Cys36, Cys41, Cys46) were replaced by alanine to avoid protein oligomerization (26Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Two individual proteins, PLBI and PLBII, were prepared with the labeling schemes shown in Fig. 1. The detergent n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside (βOG) was purchased from Melford Laboratories, and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethaneN,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (tetrasodium salt) (BAPTA) was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Preparation of Ca2+-ATPase—SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase was prepared from fast-twitch rabbit skeletal muscle according to a method adapted from East and Lee (27East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4144-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The protein was characterized by SDS-PAGE on a 10% resolving gel. Approximately 150 mg of protein was obtained in one preparation from 100 g of muscle, with concentrations calculated using an adaptation of the Lowry method (28Waterborg J.H. Matthews H.R. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 7-9Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Ca2+-ATPase—SERCA1 was reconstituted into dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) membranes using an adaptation of methods described previously (8Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) but with protein concentrations suitable for NMR analysis. Briefly, DOPC in chloroform was dried to a thin film with argon before drying further under vacuum and rehydrating with 1–2 ml of 10 mm Tris, 0.25 m sucrose buffer, pH 7.5, containing 6 mg/ml βOG. C12E8 to 1 mg/ml was added to the required volume of Ca2+-ATPase before adding the protein-detergent mixture to DOPC. The mixture was left for 15 min at room temperature then at 4 °C for 45 min. Detergent was removed using Amberlite XAD2 resin (∼100 mg/ml/h) with stirring for 3 h at room temperature. The resin beads were removed by filtering through muslin and centrifugation at 2000 rpm. Finally a sample of the suspension was centrifuged on a 10–40% density gradient at 60,000 × g for 12 h to confirm successful reconstitution. Reconstitution of PLB—Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and PLBI, PLBII, or both were dissolved in 50:50 chloroform:methanol at a molar ratio of 20:1 and dried down to a film as described earlier. Samples were then rehydrated in 10 mm phosphate, pH 7, and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm in a bench-top microcentrifuge. Pellets were stored at –20 °C until required for NMR. Co-reconstitution of Ca2+-ATPase with PLB—Co-reconstitution of Ca2+ATPase and PLB were carried out by an adaptation of a previous method (8Reddy L.G. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3954-3962Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 29Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial molar ratios of DOPC/PLB/Ca2+-ATPase were 500:20:1 or 160:10:1. DOPC and PLB were dissolved in 2–5 ml of 50:50 chloroform/methanol and dried as described above. Following rehydration (10 mm Tris, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.5, 6 mg/ml βOG) the sample was sonicated. Ca2+-ATPase was then added as described before and incubation carried out. Detergent was removed using XAD2 resin or, for NMR samples, by diluting with 10 mm phosphate, pH 7, and centrifuging at 200,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C. Finally a sample of the suspension was centrifuged on a 10–40% density gradient at 60,000 × g for 12 h. This provided a single band containing both proteins (as assessed by SDS-PAGE) and exhibiting ATPase and phosphatase activity, which thus confirmed a successful co-reconstitution. Phosphorylation of PLB—Following co-reconstitution as described above, a 500-μl sample containing 250 μg of PLB was phosphorylated using protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA). MgCl2 was added to 10 mm followed by 500 units of PKA. The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to 0.6 mm followed by a freeze/thaw cycle and incubation overnight at room temperature. Samples were then taken for ATPase activity measurements. A control co-reconstituted sample was also carried out omitting the PKA but with all other steps identical. ATPase Activity Measurements—Specific Ca2+-ATPase activity was quantified as the amount of inorganic phosphate (Pi) liberated upon hydrolysis of ATP as measured by formation of a phospho-molybdate complex under acidic conditions. The detergent C12E8 was added to the reaction mixtures to ensure that sealed vesicles were disrupted and that the protein was accessible to reagents on both sides of the membrane. Samples were made up in a total volume of 0.3 ml of reaction buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8) with CaCl2 added to give the required free calcium concentration. Following the addition of 0.2 ml of assay medium (4 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EGTA, 30 mm imidazole, pH 7.3) samples were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped in 1 ml of quench solution (ice-cold 4.5% ammonium molybdate/perchloric acid, 4:1 v/v) before extraction with 3 ml of n-butylacetate. The mixture was vortexed thoroughly and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The organic layer was then removed and the absorbance read at 320 nm in quartz cuvettes. The protein concentrations used for calculating specific activity were measured by the Lowry method (28Waterborg J.H. Matthews H.R. Walker J.M. The Protein Protocols Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 7-9Google Scholar), which detected SERCA1 but was not sensitive to the presence of PLB. Free calcium concentrations were determined essentially as described by Tatulian et al. (30Tatulian S.A. Chen B. Li J. Negash S. Middaugh C.R. Bigelow D.J. Squier T.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A buffer solution (1.5 ml) containing 50 μm BAPTA, 20 mm MOPS, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mm MgCl2,5mm ATP, pH 7, and 2 μlofCa2+ATPase stock (160 nm) was prepared. Fluorescence emission scans were carried out on the BAPTA sample at an excitation wavelength of 299 nm, and the emission was measured at a wavelength of 360 nm. Solid-state NMR Measurements—All solid state NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer operating at a magnetic field of 9.3 tesla. CP-MAS experiments were performed by rotating the sample at the magic angle in a 4-mm zirconia rotor. Hartmann-Hahn cross-polarization from 1H to 13C was achieved over a 1.6-ms contact time at a field of 65 kHz, and protons were decoupled during signal acquisition at a field of 85 kHz. REDOR experiments (13C observe, 15N dephase) were conducted at a sample spinning frequency νR of 7000 Hz using a standard spin-echo pulse-sequence with rotorsynchronized π pulses applied at the frequency of 15N (31Pan Y. Gullion T. Schaefer J. J. Magn. Reson. 1990; 90: 330-340Google Scholar). Rotational resonance experiments (32Levitt M.H. Raleigh D.P. Creuzet F. Griffin R.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1990; 92: 6347-6364Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar) were carried out at sample spinning frequencies of 11000–12500 Hz (n = 1 rotational resonance). Difference intensities, measured from spectra obtained at different mixing times after selective inversion of the carbonyl spins, were simulated numerically to obtain the distance-dependent 13C-13C dipolar coupling constant bIS (32Levitt M.H. Raleigh D.P. Creuzet F. Griffin R.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1990; 92: 6347-6364Crossref Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The sample temperature was maintained at –40 °C (±0.5 °C) in all experiments. Functional Co-reconstitution—To obtain structural information about PLB when it is functionally associated with Ca2+-ATPase, it was important to develop a reconstitution system in which labeled PLB could be detected by NMR and in which ATPase activity was regulated by PLB. The main requirements of the reconstitution were therefore a high concentration of PLB (1–5 mg in 100 μl of hydrated membranes), a PLB/Ca2+-ATPase ratio giving maximal functional regulation, and a lipid/protein ratio high enough to support ATPase activity. Two reconstitution compositions were examined, one with a lipid/PLB/Ca2+-ATPase ratio of 500:20:1 and one with a lipid/PLB/Ca2+-ATPase ratio of 160:10:1. Fast-twitch skeletal muscle (SERCA1) Ca2+-ATPase was reconstituted alone or with synthetic null-cysteine PLB into unsaturated lipid (DOPC) membranes using an adaptation of a previously described procedure (29Dalton K.A. Pilot J.D. Mall S. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). SERCA1 was examined instead of the cardiac isoform because skeletal muscle readily yields sufficient (milligram) quantities of enzyme for NMR analyses. Previous studies have shown that the functional properties of SERCA1 and its inhibition by PLB are similar to those of SERCA2a (33Toyofuku T. Kurzydlowski K. Tada M. Maclennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3088-3094Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and therefore replacement of SERCA2a by SERCA1 is valid here. The null-cysteine analogue of PLB favors the monomeric state, which is believed to regulate Ca2+-ATPase (26Karim C.B. Marquardt C.G. Stamm J.D. Barany G. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10892-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and was therefore studied in preference to wild-type PLB, which forms pentamers. SDS-PAGE of the synthetic PLB reconstituted into pure lipid (DMPC) membranes showed a dominant protein band at 5–6 kDa, which corresponded to monomeric PLB, whereas bands corresponding to higher molecular weight oligomers were insignificant or not observed (data not shown). The specific hydrolytic activity of reconstituted SERCA1 (lipid/protein ratio of 500:1) was measured at various calcium concentrations (Fig. 2). In both the absence and presence of PLB, maximal ATPase activity was observed at a calcium concentration of 1 μm. The activity was progressively inhibited as the calcium concentration was raised further to 4 μm, an effect that has been reported previously (34Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z.H. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Maximal reconstituted SERCA1 activity in the absence of PLB was 1.1 μmol/mg/min (Fig. 2A), and the Km for calcium dependence was estimated at 0.2 μm (Fig. 2B). In membranes containing PLB and SERCA1 in a molar ratio of 20:1 the maximal activity decreased to 0.4 μmol/mg/min, and Km increased to 0.61 μm (Fig. 2, A and B). Hence, in our hands, PLB both partially inhibited SERCA1 activity and lowered the enzyme affinity for calcium, as has been reported elsewhere for membranes of similar composition (12Reddy L.G. Autry J.M. Jones L.R. Thomas D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7649-7655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Although it is generally accepted that PLB lowers the affinity of Ca2+-ATPase for calcium (5Autry J.M. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15872-15880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the effect on Vmax is less well defined. A number of factors appear to be important including lipid to protein ratios and the exact PLB analogue that is used (34Cornea R.L. Autry J.M. Chen Z.H. Jones L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41487-41494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 35Hughes G. Starling A.P. Sharma R.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem.

Previous work done on a PLB analogue similar to the one used here demonstrated a similar reduction in Vmaxthe one (35Hughes G. Starling A.P. Sharma R.P. East J.M. Lee A.G. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and in the present work this result has been consistent across a number of separate assays. The important point here is that, in the presence of PLB, the Km is increased as expected, and this is shown more clearly when the data for the 500:20:1 membranes are normalized (Fig. 2B), which is a standard method of activity data presentation (14Yao Q.

In addition, following the phosphorylation of co-reconstituted PLB by incubation with PKA, Ca2+-ATPase activity is re-established (Fig. 2C), demonstrating that the reduction in Vmax is fully reversible and is not due t"

The voltage sensor in channel proteins consists of the highly positively charged segment, S4, and the negatively charged segments, S2 and S3. The process involved in the integration of the protein into the membrane remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used in vitro translation and translocation experiments to evaluate interactions between residues in the voltage sensor of a hyperpolarization-activated potassium channel, KAT1, and their effect on the final topology in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. A D95V mutation in S2 showed less S3-S4 integration into the membrane, whereas a D105V mutation allowed S4 to be released into the ER lumen. These results indicate that Asp95 assists in the membrane insertion of S3-S4 and that Asp105 helps in preventing S4 from being releasing into the ER lumen. The charge reversal mutation, R171D, in S4 rescued the D105R mutation and prevented S4 release into the ER lumen. A series of constructs containing different C-terminal truncations of S4 showed that Arg174 was required for correct integration of S3 and S4 into the membrane. Interactions between Asp105 and Arg171 and between negative residues in S2 or S3 and Arg174 may be formed transiently during membrane integration. These data clarify the role of charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 and identify posttranslational electrostatic interactions between charged residues that are required to achieve the correct voltage sensor topology in the ER membrane.

Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The fourth transmembrane segment, S4, which contains several positively charged residues and is only weakly hydrophobic, is part of the voltage sensor. To date, there have been several reports on the operation of the voltage sensor in Shaker-type channels (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 4Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R.

Nature. 2002; 419: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To express channel function, the voltage-dependent channel must be correctly integrated in the membrane, allowing the correct positioning of a set of amino acids involved in voltage sensing. Knowledge of the mechanism involved in the topogenesis of the voltage sensor in ion channels would provide great advances in our understanding of the voltage-sensing configuration. Only a limited number of reports have dealt with the membrane topogenesis of the different regions. Mutational analysis combined with electrophysiological measurements has identified the charged residues involved in the folding and function of theDrosophila Shaker K+ channel (8Perozo E. Santacruz-Toloza L. Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 345-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Seoh S.A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, a model involving electrostatic interactions between charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 has been proposed on the basis of the time course of Shaker channel maturation in Xenopus laevis oocytes (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To address the question of how the final membrane topology of the K+ channel is reached, more experimental data on transmembrane biogenesis are needed.KAT1 is a well characterized plant hyperpolarization-activated K+ channel (11Uozumi N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C733-C739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schachtman D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plant K+ channels play an important role in signal transduction and regulation of ion homeostatics (13Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and their membrane topology resembles that of animal Shaker channels (14Uozumi N. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Muto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies of the topogenic function of each of the six transmembrane regions, S1–S6, and of the pore region of KAT1 have demonstrated that the four hydrophobic segments, S1, S2, S5, and S6, are integrated sequentially into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane (15Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas S3 and S4 are suggested to be synergistically and posttranslationally integrated into the membrane only after a specific interaction occurs between them (16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since S4 does not possess a stop-transfer function and is not released into the ER lumen (16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we wished to identify the residues and intramolecular interactions involved in its retention in the membrane. The integration involving the pairing of transmembrane units has been recognized as a second type of biogenesis of polytopic membrane proteins (17Chin C.N. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The biogenesis process seems to be essential for the integration of charged transmembrane segments, which have low hydrophilic property. Further detailed study of the membrane insertion of the voltage sensor in the KAT1 channel will provide information on the dynamic membrane insertion process of closely spaced transmembrane segments throughout the polypeptide. To understand the molecular basis of the topogenic mechanism for the integration of S3 and S4 into the membrane, we have used in vitro translation and translocation experiments to evaluate the role of individual residues in KAT1 S2, S3, and S4 in the integration of the protein into the ER membrane and have identified specific interactions between charged residues that contribute to KAT1 membrane topology.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used molecular dissection to assess the contribution of negatively and positively charged residues in S2–S4 to directing the final topology of the KAT1 voltage sensor. Single mutation of the negatively charged residues, Asp95, Asp105, and Asp141, had a clear effect on KAT1 topology, whereas single mutation of the positively charged residues, Arg165, Arg171, Arg174, Arg176, and Arg177, did not. However, the use of double mutations (Fig. 4D) or truncated proteins (Fig. 5) allowed us to analyze the role of S4 arginine residues in membrane topogenesis. For membrane integration of the voltage-sensing segments, negative amino acids in S2 are essential (Fig. 3B), but the positive residues in S4 can be compensated by neighboring positive residues (Fig. 4, A and B). Amino acid sequence alignment also showed that the negatively charged residues in S2 and in S3 are well conserved between animal and plant channels (Fig.1B), whereas positive residues in S4 vary in number and spacing (Fig. 1B).We found that several forces are involved in achieving the correct membrane integration of S3 and S4 as summarized in Fig.7. Replacement of S1 and S2 with H1 did not allow S3 and S4 to form the transmembrane structure (Fig. 2,A and B). Studies of voltage sensor operation in animal channels have predicted that negative residues in KAT1 are essential for channel function (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 6Papazian D.M. Bezanilla F. Adv.

In this study, we found that Asp95 and Asp105 are also involved in generating the correct membrane topology of the voltage sensor, each playing different roles. In the absence of a negative charge at Asp95 (D95V), the amount of S3 and S4 in the membrane was reduced (Figs. 3 and 6), suggesting that Asp95 assists in pulling the S3-S4 complex into the membrane. Replacement of Asp105 with valine or arginine caused release of S4 into the ER lumen (Figs. 3 and 6), and in the case of the D105R mutant, this effect was overcome by additional mutation of Arg171 in S4 to aspartate (Fig. 4D), showing that pairing of Asp105 and Arg171 occurs during the step of membrane integration of S3 and S4. Previous studies have indicated that electrostatic neutralization by Asp141 is a critical event for the initiation of membrane integration of S3 and S4 (14Uozumi N. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Muto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig.7 illustrates the interactions possibly involved in the membrane integration of S3 and S4.Interaction probably begins at N-terminal residues of S4 during their membrane insertion (17Chin C.N. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Membrane integration of voltage sensor segments is thought to involve a series of interactions between positively and negatively charged residues. Arg174, Arg176, Arg177, and/or Arg184helped stabilize S4 in the membrane at the end of the S4 insertion event (Fig. 5). Since these residues reside within the membrane and Asp105 is located on the cytosolic side of the membrane according to a map of charged residues in the animal Shaker channel (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 4Cha A.

Moreover, in the animal Shaker channel, electrostatic interaction between charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 is involved in operating voltage sensing (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the Drosophila Shaker K+ channel, residues Glu283, Arg368, and Arg371 (corresponding to Asp95, Arg171, and Arg174 in KAT1; Fig. 1B) form one charge network, whereas residues Glu293, Asp316, and Lys374(corresponding to Asp105, Asp141, and Arg177 in KAT1) form the other (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K.

If the same applies to KAT1, Asp105 and Arg171 would belong to different networks (pairing groups) in the final topology, and the Asp105-Arg171 interaction, which was shown to affect the retention of S4 in the membrane (Fig. 4D), may represent a transient initial step in the insertion process. Further information on the final structure of voltage sensor segments will help us to uncover the membrane integration process completely.The use of proteins containing truncated S4 (Fig. 5) provided evidence for another electrostatic interaction between voltage-sensing segments and showed that Arg174 was a determining factor in S4 retention in the membrane (Fig. 5). We tried to determine which negative residue in S2 or in S3 interacted with Arg174using the mutant containing R174D, but this did not give the di-glycosylated band (data not shown). Taking into consideration the loss of function of D95V-, D105V-, and D141V-containing KAT1 and the retention of activity of R174V-containing KAT1 (Fig. 4C), Arg174 is unlikely to contribute a gating charge movement in the final topology by its interaction with Asp95, Asp105, or Asp141. The interaction of Arg174 with negative residues may be a transient event during the acquisition of the final topology. We estimate that, during membrane integration, the interaction between Arg171 and Asp105 is stronger than that between Arg174 and as yet undefined negative residues since the former interaction could be detected by the double mutation approach (Fig. 4D).Unlike the classical insertion of hydrophobic transmembrane segments into the membrane, the insertion process of S3-S4 in KAT1 into the membrane involves the posttranslational peptide binding of transmembrane segments, a newly recognized second type of membrane protein integration process (17Chin C.N. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 have been reported to be crucial to the voltage-sensing operation (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen.

In this study, we have identified interactions between charged residues in voltage sensor segments and demonstrated their contribution to the membrane integration of S3 and S4, which shows that the charged residues also play a crucial role in the biogenesis of the voltage dependent KAT1 channel. Voltage-dependent (gated) K+ channels contain six transmembrane segments (S1–S6) and the pore (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 91-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The fourth transmembrane segment, S4, which contains several positively charged residues and is only weakly hydrophobic, is part of the voltage sensor. To date, there have been several reports on the operation of the voltage sensor in Shaker-type channels (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 4Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R.

Nature. 2002; 419: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To express channel function, the voltage-dependent channel must be correctly integrated in the membrane, allowing the correct positioning of a set of amino acids involved in voltage sensing. Knowledge of the mechanism involved in the topogenesis of the voltage sensor in ion channels would provide great advances in our understanding of the voltage-sensing configuration. Only a limited number of reports have dealt with the membrane topogenesis of the different regions. Mutational analysis combined with electrophysiological measurements has identified the charged residues involved in the folding and function of theDrosophila Shaker K+ channel (8Perozo E. Santacruz-Toloza L. Stefani E. Bezanilla F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 345-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 9Papazian D.M. Shao X.M. Seoh S.A. Mock A.F. Huang Y. Wainstock D.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1293-1301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In addition, a model involving electrostatic interactions between charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 has been proposed on the basis of the time course of Shaker channel maturation in Xenopus laevis oocytes (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F. Papazian D.M. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1489-1500Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To address the question of how the final membrane topology of the K+ channel is reached, more experimental data on transmembrane biogenesis are needed. KAT1 is a well characterized plant hyperpolarization-activated K+ channel (11Uozumi N. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C733-C739Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Schachtman D.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 127-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plant K+ channels play an important role in signal transduction and regulation of ion homeostatics (13Rodrı́guez-Navarro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), and their membrane topology resembles that of animal Shaker channels (14Uozumi N. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Muto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Studies of the topogenic function of each of the six transmembrane regions, S1–S6, and of the pore region of KAT1 have demonstrated that the four hydrophobic segments, S1, S2, S5, and S6, are integrated sequentially into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 membrane (15Ota K. Sakaguchi M. Hamasaki N. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28286-28291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas S3 and S4 are suggested to be synergistically and posttranslationally integrated into the membrane only after a specific interaction occurs between them (16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Since S4 does not possess a stop-transfer function and is not released into the ER lumen (16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we wished to identify the residues and intramolecular interactions involved in its retention in the membrane. The integration involving the pairing of transmembrane units has been recognized as a second type of biogenesis of polytopic membrane proteins (17Chin C.N. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The biogenesis process seems to be essential for the integration of charged transmembrane segments, which have low hydrophilic property. Further detailed study of the membrane insertion of the voltage sensor in the KAT1 channel will provide information on the dynamic membrane insertion process of closely spaced transmembrane segments throughout the polypeptide. To understand the molecular basis of the topogenic mechanism for the integration of S3 and S4 into the membrane, we have used in vitro translation and translocation experiments to evaluate the role of individual residues in KAT1 S2, S3, and S4 in the integration of the protein into the ER membrane and have identified specific interactions between charged residues that contribute to KAT1 membrane topology. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we used molecular dissection to assess the contribution of negatively and positively charged residues in S2–S4 to directing the final topology of the KAT1 voltage sensor. Single mutation of the negatively charged residues, Asp95, Asp105, and Asp141, had a clear effect on KAT1 topology, whereas single mutation of the positively charged residues, Arg165, Arg171, Arg174, Arg176, and Arg177, did not. However, the use of double mutations (Fig. 4D) or truncated proteins (Fig. 5) allowed us to analyze the role of S4 arginine residues in membrane topogenesis. For membrane integration of the voltage-sensing segments, negative amino acids in S2 are essential (Fig. 3B), but the positive residues in S4 can be compensated by neighboring positive residues (Fig. 4, A and B). Amino acid sequence alignment also showed that the negatively charged residues in S2 and in S3 are well conserved between animal and plant channels (Fig.1B), whereas positive residues in S4 vary in number and spacing (Fig. 1B).We found that several forces are involved in achieving the correct membrane integration of S3 and S4 as summarized in Fig.7. Replacement of S1 and S2 with H1 did not allow S3 and S4 to form the transmembrane structure (Fig. 2,A and B). Studies of voltage sensor operation in animal channels have predicted that negative residues in KAT1 are essential for channel function (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 6Papazian D.M. Bezanilla F. Adv.

In this study, we found that Asp95 and Asp105 are also involved in generating the correct membrane topology of the voltage sensor, each playing different roles. In the absence of a negative charge at Asp95 (D95V), the amount of S3 and S4 in the membrane was reduced (Figs. 3 and 6), suggesting that Asp95 assists in pulling the S3-S4 complex into the membrane. Replacement of Asp105 with valine or arginine caused release of S4 into the ER lumen (Figs. 3 and 6), and in the case of the D105R mutant, this effect was overcome by additional mutation of Arg171 in S4 to aspartate (Fig. 4D), showing that pairing of Asp105 and Arg171 occurs during the step of membrane integration of S3 and S4. Previous studies have indicated that electrostatic neutralization by Asp141 is a critical event for the initiation of membrane integration of S3 and S4 (14Uozumi N. Nakamura T. Schroeder J.I. Muto S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9773-9778Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 16Sato Y. Sakaguchi M. Goshima S. Nakamura T. Uozumi N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Fig.7 illustrates the interactions possibly involved in the membrane integration of S3 and S4.Interaction probably begins at N-terminal residues of S4 during their membrane insertion (17Chin C.N. von Heijne G. de Gier J.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 231-234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Membrane integration of voltage sensor segments is thought to involve a series of interactions between positively and negatively charged residues. Arg174, Arg176, Arg177, and/or Arg184helped stabilize S4 in the membrane at the end of the S4 insertion event (Fig. 5). Since these residues reside within the membrane and Asp105 is located on the cytosolic side of the membrane according to a map of charged residues in the animal Shaker channel (2Gandhi C.S. Isacoff E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 3Bezanilla F. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 555-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 4Cha A.

Moreover, in the animal Shaker channel, electrostatic interaction between charged residues in S2, S3, and S4 is involved in operating voltage sensing (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K. Schulteis C.T. Mock A.F.

In the Drosophila Shaker K+ channel, residues Glu283, Arg368, and Arg371 (corresponding to Asp95, Arg171, and Arg174 in KAT1; Fig. 1B) form one charge network, whereas residues Glu293, Asp316, and Lys374(corresponding to Asp105, Asp141, and Arg177 in KAT1) form the other (10Tiwari-Woodruff S.K.

However, PLD2 is fully active in the presence of this phospholipid, whereas PLD1 activation is dependent on additional factors such as ADP-ribosylation factor-1 (ARF-1) and protein kinase Cα. We find that mastoparan, an activator of Gi and mast cells, stimulates an intrinsic PLD activity, most likely PLD2, in fractions enriched in plasma membranes from rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 mast cells. Overexpression of PLD2, but not of PLD1, results in a large increase in the mastoparan-inducible PLD activity in membrane fractions, particularly those enriched in plasma membranes. As in previous studies, expressed PLD2 is localized primarily in the plasma membrane and PLD1 in granule membranes. Studies with pertussis toxin and other agents indicate that mastoparan stimulates PLD2 independently of Gi, ARF-1, protein kinase C, and calcium. Kinetic studies indicate that mastoparan interacts synergistically with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and that oleate, itself a weak stimulant of PLD2 at low concentrations, is a competitive inhibitor of mastoparan stimulation of PLD2. Therefore, mastoparan may be useful for investigating the regulation of PLD2, particularly in view of the well studied molecular interactions of mastoparan with certain other strategic signaling proteins.

PLD2 activity could conceivably be regulated in vivo by PLD2 inhibitory proteins such as the synucleins (4Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J.

It has been shown that intracellular production of PI 4,5-bisphosphate is coupled to PLD activation (20Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Google Scholar, 21Arneson L.S.

Halstead J.R. D'Andrea S. Fernandez-Borga M. Oomen L. Saqib K.M. Wakelem M.J.O. D'Santos C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5440-5449Google Scholar). However, there is no unambiguous evidence that any of these mechanisms operate in physiologically stimulated cells. Oleate at sub-millimolar concentrations stimulates PLD2 activity in the absence of PI 4,5-bisphosphate and synergistically stimulates PLD2 activity in the presence of PI 4,5-bisphosphate (25Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Google Scholar, 26Sarri E. Pardo R. Fensome-Green A. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2002; 369: 319-329Google Scholar). At high millimolar concentrations, oleate inhibits PLD2 as well as PLD1 activities (17Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Google Scholar,27Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11408-11413Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the effects of oleate on PLD2 is unclear.PLD appears to be essential for stimulated secretion of granules from mast cells. Studies with pharmacologic agents in the rat (RBL-2H3) mast cell line show that PLD activation correlates closely with secretion under a variety of circumstances (28Cissel D.S. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 110-118Google Scholar, 29Chahdi A. Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1269-1276Google Scholar) and that primary alcohols, which divert the production of phosphatidic acid by PLD to phosphatidylalcohol (referred to as a transphosphatidylation reaction), suppress secretion as well (20Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Google Scholar, 28Cissel D.S. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 110-118Google Scholar). Moreover, the secretory response to antigen can be reconstituted in permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells by provision of ARF-1 or the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, either of which increases levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and thereby restores PLD activity (20Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Google Scholar). Both isoforms of PLD are present in RBL-2H3 cells (30Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Google Scholar). Expression studies with wild type and mutant forms of the PLDs suggest that both isoforms participate in the secretory process (30Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Google Scholar) and that PLD1 is expressed primarily on the granule membrane and PLD2 on the plasma membrane (30Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Google Scholar, 31Brown F.D. Thompson N. Saqid K.M. Clark J.M. Powner D. Thompson N.T. Solari R. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 835-838Google Scholar).Mastoparan, a cationic tetradecapeptide and a mast cell stimulant, can assume an amphipathic α-helical conformation in a hydrophobic environment and is known to mimic the interactions of physiologic proteins with target proteins such as trimeric G proteins (32Sukumar M. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Google Scholar) and calmodulin (33Murase T. Iio T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1618-1629Google Scholar, 34Malencik D. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2420-2428Google Scholar). It has also been reported that mastoparan inhibits ARF1-stimulated PLD activity (35Fensome A. Cunningham E. Troung O. Cockcroft S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 34-38Google Scholar), now recognized as PLD1, in cytosol-depleted cells, although more recent reports suggest that mastoparan is a stimulant of PLD in intact cells (36Mizuno K. Nakahata N. Ohizumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2090-2096Google Scholar, 37Lee S.Y. Park N.G. Choi M.U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 50-54Google Scholar, 38Farquhar M. Soomets U. Bates R.L. Martin A. Langel U. Howl J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 63-70Google Scholar). While investigating the mechanisms of action of mastoparan and other compounds thought to stimulate mast cell secretion through the G protein Gi (39Mousli M. Bueb J.L. Bronner C. Rouot B. Landry Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 358-362Google Scholar), we found that mastoparan is a uniquely strong stimulant of PLD in the cultured RBL-2H3 mast cells. These and additional studies with membrane fractions from normal RBL-2H3 cells and cells made to overexpress PLD1 or PLD2 show that mastoparan selectively activates PLD2 in the plasma membrane independently of any action on Gi.DISCUSSIONMastoparan activates endogenous PLD in intact RBL-2H3 cells and in isolated preparations enriched in plasma membranes where PLD2 is located. This activation was apparent when PLD activity was assessed by the transphosphatidylation assay in intact cells and by a [3H]choline release assay in membrane preparations. The studies with expressed PLD isoforms confirm that mastoparan selectively activates PLD2 in membrane preparations in both RBL-2H3 and COS7 cells. The activation of PLD2 is not dependent on Gαi, PKC, or calcium. This is in contrast to the stimulation of PLD and the secretion by compound 48/80 and other polybasic secretagogues in intact mast cells, where these responses are mediated via Gαi, and are dependent on PKC or calcium (49Chahdi A. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 122-130Google Scholar, 50Senyshyn J. Baumgartner R.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5136-5144Google Scholar). Therefore, mastoparan has additional activities distinct from its ability to activate Gαi; one of them apparently is the ability to activate PLD2 but not PLD1 in membrane preparations.Mastoparan can assume an amphipathic α-helical conformation on passing from an aqueous to lipid environment and, by so doing, can mimic the interactions of physiologic α-helical proteins with key signaling molecules such as Gi with receptors (32Sukumar M. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Google Scholar) and calmodulin with calmodulin-binding proteins. With respect to calmodulin, mastoparan binds with exceptionally high affinity in a calcium-dependent manner (33Murase T. Iio T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1618-1629Google Scholar) resulting in possible displacement of calmodulin-binding proteins (34Malencik D. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2420-2428Google Scholar). Mastoparan assumes a helical conformation within the globular Ca2+/calmodulin/mastoparan complex in a manner that is thought to reproduce the interaction of calmodulin with target proteins (51Brown S. Martin S. Bayley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Google Scholar). Calmodulin has been proposed as a negative regulator of basal PLD2 activity on the basis of the effects of calmodulin inhibitors (52Boyano-Adanez M.C. Gustavsson L. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 261-268Google Scholar). Whether mastoparan unmasks latent PLD2 activity by disabling the inhibitory activity of calmodulin or that of other, better characterized inhibitors of PLD such as the synucleins (7Frohman M. Sung T.-C. Morris A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Google Scholar) is unknown but worthy of further investigation. In particular, the synucleins possess conserved amphipathic α-helical domains (53), are potent inhibitors of PLD2 (4Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Google Scholar, 19Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Google Scholar), and are present in abundant amounts in RBL-2H3 membranes. 2W. S. Choi, unpublished data.It is possible also that mastoparan interacts directly with PLD2 because it can stimulate PLD2 in the absence of, and to the same extent as, PI 4,5-bisphosphosphate and yet act in synergy with PI 4,5-bisphosphate. Moreover, the studies with oleate and mastoparan (Fig. 7) suggest that these two agents compete for the same site and that occupation of this site by mastoparan and, to a much lesser extent, oleate, causes activation of PLD2 in the absence of PI 4,5-bisphosphate. The ability of mastoparan (this paper) and oleate (25Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Google Scholar) to act in synergy with PI 4,5-bisphosphate suggests further that the mastoparan/oleate-binding site is distinct from the PI 4,5-bisphosphate-binding site. In this context, oleate appears to act as a partial agonist or antagonist and mastoparan as a full agonist, because oleate inhibits stimulation of PLD2 by mastoparan. If this scenario is correct and the physiologic ligand for the mastoparan/oleate-binding site is a regulator of PLD2 activity, mastoparan might be a useful probe for studies of PLD2 in view of the well studied molecular interactions of mastoparan with other strategic signaling molecules. Phospholipase D (PLD),1which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to form phosphatidic acid, is present in most mammalian cells, where it is presumed to serve important roles in cell function (1Exton J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 303-320Google Scholar, 2Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Google Scholar, 3Jones D. Morgan C. Cockcroft S. Biochim. Biophys.

Two mammalian isoforms have been cloned, namely PLD1 (as two variants, PLD1a and PLD1b) and PLD2, both of which require phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate for activity (4Colley W.C. Sung T.C.

J. 2002; 369: 319-329Google Scholar). At high millimolar concentrations, oleate inhibits PLD2 as well as PLD1 activities (17Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12846-12852Google Scholar,27Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11408-11413Google Scholar). The physiological significance of the effects of oleate on PLD2 is unclear. PLD appears to be essential for stimulated secretion of granules from mast cells. Studies with pharmacologic agents in the rat (RBL-2H3) mast cell line show that PLD activation correlates closely with secretion under a variety of circumstances (28Cissel D.S. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 110-118Google Scholar, 29Chahdi A. Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 38: 1269-1276Google Scholar) and that primary alcohols, which divert the production of phosphatidic acid by PLD to phosphatidylalcohol (referred to as a transphosphatidylation reaction), suppress secretion as well (20Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Google Scholar, 28Cissel D.S. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 110-118Google Scholar). Moreover, the secretory response to antigen can be reconstituted in permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells by provision of ARF-1 or the phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, either of which increases levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and thereby restores PLD activity (20Way G. O'Luanaigh N. Cockcroft S. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 63-70Google Scholar). Both isoforms of PLD are present in RBL-2H3 cells (30Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Google Scholar). Expression studies with wild type and mutant forms of the PLDs suggest that both isoforms participate in the secretory process (30Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Google Scholar) and that PLD1 is expressed primarily on the granule membrane and PLD2 on the plasma membrane (30Choi W.S. Kim Y.M. Combs C. Frohman M.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5682-5689Google Scholar, 31Brown F.D. Thompson N. Saqid K.M. Clark J.M. Powner D. Thompson N.T. Solari R. Wakelam M.J.O. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 835-838Google Scholar). Mastoparan, a cationic tetradecapeptide and a mast cell stimulant, can assume an amphipathic α-helical conformation in a hydrophobic environment and is known to mimic the interactions of physiologic proteins with target proteins such as trimeric G proteins (32Sukumar M. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Google Scholar) and calmodulin (33Murase T. Iio T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1618-1629Google Scholar, 34Malencik D. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2420-2428Google Scholar). It has also been reported that mastoparan inhibits ARF1-stimulated PLD activity (35Fensome A. Cunningham E. Troung O. Cockcroft S. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 34-38Google Scholar), now recognized as PLD1, in cytosol-depleted cells, although more recent reports suggest that mastoparan is a stimulant of PLD in intact cells (36Mizuno K. Nakahata N. Ohizumi Y. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 116: 2090-2096Google Scholar, 37Lee S.Y. Park N.G. Choi M.U. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 50-54Google Scholar, 38Farquhar M. Soomets U. Bates R.L. Martin A. Langel U. Howl J. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 63-70Google Scholar). While investigating the mechanisms of action of mastoparan and other compounds thought to stimulate mast cell secretion through the G protein Gi (39Mousli M. Bueb J.L. Bronner C. Rouot B. Landry Y. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 358-362Google Scholar), we found that mastoparan is a uniquely strong stimulant of PLD in the cultured RBL-2H3 mast cells. These and additional studies with membrane fractions from normal RBL-2H3 cells and cells made to overexpress PLD1 or PLD2 show that mastoparan selectively activates PLD2 in the plasma membrane independently of any action on Gi. DISCUSSIONMastoparan activates endogenous PLD in intact RBL-2H3 cells and in isolated preparations enriched in plasma membranes where PLD2 is located. This activation was apparent when PLD activity was assessed by the transphosphatidylation assay in intact cells and by a [3H]choline release assay in membrane preparations. The studies with expressed PLD isoforms confirm that mastoparan selectively activates PLD2 in membrane preparations in both RBL-2H3 and COS7 cells. The activation of PLD2 is not dependent on Gαi, PKC, or calcium. This is in contrast to the stimulation of PLD and the secretion by compound 48/80 and other polybasic secretagogues in intact mast cells, where these responses are mediated via Gαi, and are dependent on PKC or calcium (49Chahdi A. Fraundorfer P.F. Beaven M.A. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2000; 292: 122-130Google Scholar, 50Senyshyn J. Baumgartner R.A. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5136-5144Google Scholar). Therefore, mastoparan has additional activities distinct from its ability to activate Gαi; one of them apparently is the ability to activate PLD2 but not PLD1 in membrane preparations.Mastoparan can assume an amphipathic α-helical conformation on passing from an aqueous to lipid environment and, by so doing, can mimic the interactions of physiologic α-helical proteins with key signaling molecules such as Gi with receptors (32Sukumar M. Higashijima T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21421-21424Google Scholar) and calmodulin with calmodulin-binding proteins. With respect to calmodulin, mastoparan binds with exceptionally high affinity in a calcium-dependent manner (33Murase T. Iio T. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1618-1629Google Scholar) resulting in possible displacement of calmodulin-binding proteins (34Malencik D. Anderson S. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2420-2428Google Scholar). Mastoparan assumes a helical conformation within the globular Ca2+/calmodulin/mastoparan complex in a manner that is thought to reproduce the interaction of calmodulin with target proteins (51Brown S. Martin S. Bayley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3389-3397Google Scholar). Calmodulin has been proposed as a negative regulator of basal PLD2 activity on the basis of the effects of calmodulin inhibitors (52Boyano-Adanez M.C. Gustavsson L. Neurochem. Int. 2002; 40: 261-268Google Scholar). Whether mastoparan unmasks latent PLD2 activity by disabling the inhibitory activity of calmodulin or that of other, better characterized inhibitors of PLD such as the synucleins (7Frohman M. Sung T.-C. Morris A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Google Scholar) is unknown but worthy of further investigation. In particular, the synucleins possess conserved amphipathic α-helical domains (53), are potent inhibitors of PLD2 (4Colley W.C. Sung T.C. Roll R. Jenco J. Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y. Bar-Sagi D. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 191-201Google Scholar, 19Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Google Scholar), and are present in abundant amounts in RBL-2H3 membranes. 2W. S. Choi, unpublished data.It is possible also that mastoparan interacts directly with PLD2 because it can stimulate PLD2 in the absence of, and to the same extent as, PI 4,5-bisphosphosphate and yet act in synergy with PI 4,5-bisphosphate. Moreover, the studies with oleate and mastoparan (Fig. 7) suggest that these two agents compete for the same site and that occupation of this site by mastoparan and, to a much lesser extent, oleate, causes activation of PLD2 in the absence of PI 4,5-bisphosphate. The ability of mastoparan (this paper) and oleate (25Kim J.H. Kim Y. Lee S.D. Lopez I. Arnold R.S. Lambeth J.D. Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 454: 42-46Google Scholar) to act in synergy with PI 4,5-bisphosphate suggests further that the mastoparan/oleate-binding site is distinct from the PI 4,5-bisphosphate-binding site. In this context, oleate appears to act as a partial agonist or antagonist and mastoparan as a full agonist, because oleate inhibits stimulation of PLD2 by mastoparan. If this scenario is correct and the physiologic ligand for the mastoparan/oleate-binding site is a regulator of PLD2 activity, mastoparan might be a useful probe for studies of PLD2 in view of the well studied molecular interactions of mastoparan with other strategic signaling molecules. Mastoparan activates endogenous PLD in intact RBL-2H3 cells and in isolated preparations enriched in plasma membranes where PLD2 is located.

https://openalex.org/W2061215562,"The 1.4-Å crystal structure of the oxidized state of a Y25S variant of cytochrome cd1nitrite reductase from Paracoccus pantotrophus is described. It shows that loss of Tyr25, a ligand via its hydroxy group to the iron of the d1 heme in the oxidized (as prepared) wild-type enzyme, does not result in a switch at the c heme of the unusual bishistidinyl coordination to the histidine/methionine coordination seen in other conformations of the enzyme. The Ser25 side chain is seen in two positions in the d1 heme pocket with relative occupancies of ∼7:3, but in neither case is the hydroxy group bound to the iron atom; instead, a sulfate ion from the crystallization solution is bound between the Ser25 side chain and the heme iron. Unlike the wild-type enzyme, the Y25S mutant is active as a reductase toward nitrite, oxygen, and hydroxylamine without a reductive activation step. It is concluded that Tyr25 is not essential for catalysis of reduction of any substrate, but that the requirement for activation by reduction of the wild-type enzyme is related to a requirement to drive the dissociation of this residue from the active site. The Y25S protein retains the d1 heme less well than the wild-type protein, suggesting that the tyrosine residue has a role in stabilizing the binding of this cofactor.1GQ1 The 1.4-Å crystal structure of the oxidized state of a Y25S variant of cytochrome cd1nitrite reductase from Paracoccus pantotrophus is described.

The cytochrome c domain, carrying a heme that is attached to the protein via two thioether bonds (Fig.1), receives electrons from cupredoxins and c-type cytochrome donor proteins (1Allen J.W.A.

The active site on each subunit contains a specialized d1 heme (Fig. 1) at which the physiological substrate, nitrite, binds and is reduced. The d1 heme, found only in this class of enzyme and bound in an eight-bladed ॆ-propeller structure (see Fig. 2), is re-reduced in turn by electrons supplied by the heme of the α-helical c domain of the same subunit (see Fig. 2). Release of the reaction product nitric oxide from thed1 heme is not necessarily facile, as, in general, nitric oxide binds very tightly to heme, especially the ferrous state. Indeed, in several rapid reaction kinetic studies of cytochrome cd1, retention of nitric oxide at the d1 heme active site has been observed (e.g.Refs. 5George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J.

The figure is oriented such that the mainly α-helical c-type cytochrome-binding domain is at the top, with the eight-bladed ॆ-propeller d1heme-binding domain below; the hemes are shown in black. In the oxidized enzyme structure shown here, the c heme iron has His17 and His69 as axial ligands; thed1 heme is ligated by His200 and Tyr25. The overall structure of the Y25S variant is essentially identical to that of the wild-type enzyme, with small differences only in the vicinity of the mutated residue (see 舠Results舡); His/His coordination of the c heme is retained, whereas the d1 heme is axially ligated by His200 and a sulfate ion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The crystal structures of cytochromes cd1 from two different species of bacteria, Paracoccus pantotrophus(formerly Thiosphaera pantotropha) (7Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Google Scholar) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8Nurizzo D. Silvistrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1157-1171Google Scholar), have produced a number of surprises. Among these is the unusual ligation of the two types of heme in the oxidized (as prepared) form of the enzyme from P. pantotrophus. The heme of the c-type cytochrome center is bishistidinyl-coordinated, whereas the d1-type cytochrome center has a proximal histidine ligand but a distal tyrosine, residue 25. The latter is contributed by the cytochromec domain of the protein and is only seven residues apart from, and on the same polypeptide loop as, histidine 17, which is one of the ligands to the iron atom of the c-type cytochrome center (7Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Google Scholar). Upon reduction of crystals of the oxidized P. pantotrophusenzyme, histidine 17 was replaced as a ligand of the c heme iron by methionine 106 and tyrosine 25 dissociated from thed1 heme active site, leaving a five-coordinate iron (9Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Google Scholar). This suggested that ligand switching might be important in regulating the movement of electrons from the c to thed1 center and/or in providing a mechanism for displacing nitric oxide from the active site (7Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Google Scholar, 9Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Google Scholar). An alternative structure of the reduced cytochrome cd1 from this bacterium was subsequently obtained by crystallizing reduced enzyme. In this case, the relative positions of the c andd1 domains were different, but the ligand switching seen in the original crystal structures of the oxidized and reduced enzyme had still occurred (10Sjögren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29450-29455Google Scholar). However, the 舠switched舡 ligands were retained after reoxidation of this new crystal form (10Sjögren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29450-29455Google Scholar). The presence in the P. pantotrophus enzyme of tyrosine 25 bound to the d1 heme and histidine 17 bound to the c heme was unexpected because neither of these residues is conserved in the cytochromes cd1 from other bacteria apart from the very closely related Paracoccus denitrificans. Accordingly, the structure of the oxidized cytochrome cd1 from P. aeruginosa (8Nurizzo D. Silvistrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1157-1171Google Scholar) showed that the d1 heme was ligated differently from that in P. pantotrophus. In the former, a hydroxide was the distal ligand to the d1 heme iron, but with a hydrogen bond to a tyrosine residue (position 10) that was in no sense equivalent in the structure to tyrosine 25 in the P. pantotrophus enzyme. Tyrosine 10, which is not an essential residue (11Cutruzzolà F. Arese M. Grasso S. Bellelli A. Brunori M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 365-369Google Scholar), is not provided by the same subunit as that in which it is positioned close to the d1 heme iron,i.e. there is a domain swapping (8Nurizzo D. Silvistrini M.C. Mathieu M. Cutruzzolà F. Fülöp V. Hajdu J. Brunori M. Cambillau C. Tegoni M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1157-1171Google Scholar). The c heme also differed, with the equivalent of methionine 106 of the P. pantotrophus enzyme being a ligand in the oxidized P. aeruginosa enzyme, along with the histidine of the CXXCH motif that is characteristic of a c-type cytochrome. The coordination of the c-type cytochrome heme in the oxidized P. aeruginosa enzyme is thus equivalent to that in the reduced P. pantotrophus enzyme. In solution, spectroscopic analysis is consistent with ligation of tyrosine to the d1 heme iron of the oxidized (as prepared) P. pantotrophus enzyme and has demonstrated the same bishistidinyl coordination of the c heme as seen in the crystal (12Cheesman M.R. Ferguson S.J. Moir J.W.B. Richardson D.J. Zumft W.G. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16267-16276Google Scholar). However, it has recently been shown that a catalytically more active form of the protein is obtained if the enzyme is first reduced and then oxidized by one of its alternative substrates, hydroxylamine (13Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Google Scholar). This much more active (initially) oxidized form has His/Met coordination at the c heme (14Allen J.W.A. Cheesman M.R. Higham C.W. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 674-677Google Scholar), while visible absorption and EPR spectra indicate that tyrosine 25 is not bound to the d1 heme. Simple pre-reduction of the enzyme has also resulted in much higher kcat values than could be obtained with the oxidized (as prepared) enzyme for any of the electron donor proteins: cytochrome c550, pseudoazurin, or horse heart cytochrome c, in combination with any of the three known electron acceptors, nitrite, oxygen, or hydroxylamine (3Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.J. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3093-3100Google Scholar, 13Allen J.W.A. Watmough N.J. Ferguson S.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 885-888Google Scholar). Cytochrome cd1 can act as an oxidase; and in the early stages of this reaction an oxidized state of the protein with His/Met coordination at the c-type cytochrome center has been observed (10Sjögren T. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29450-29455Google Scholar, 15Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Google Scholar), as was also the case for a form of the enzyme seen after a 1-electron oxidation of cytochromecd1 by nitrite (5George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Google Scholar). His/Met coordination of the heme of the c domain in the oxidized state is also found in solution for both the semi-apo form of the protein that has lost thed1 heme (15Koppenhöfer A. Little R.H. Lowe D.J. Ferguson S.J. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4028-4036Google Scholar) and the c domain expressed in isolation (16Steensma E. Gordon E. Oster L.M. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5846-5855Google Scholar). Although the combination of the observations on the catalytic activity of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 and the structure of the P. aeruginosa enzyme suggests that bishistidinyl coordination at the c heme and tyrosine ligation at the d1 heme may not be significant in steady-state catalysis, there remain many unanswered questions about structure-function relationships for P. pantotrophuscytochrome cd1, particularly with respect to the role of tyrosine 25. For example, in a rapid reaction study starting from fully reduced enzyme and nitrite, nitric oxide was not released from the enzyme, suggesting that some conformational change was needed to trigger this event (Ref. 5George S.J. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33231-33237Google Scholar and see also Ref. 17Ranghino G. Scorza E. Sjogren T. Williams P.A. Ricci M. Hajdu J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10958-10966Google Scholar). Structures of cytochrome cd1 from crystals that had first been reduced and then treated with nitrite showed tyrosine 25 apparently poised ready to displace a bound nitric oxide (9Williams P.A. Fülöp V. Garman E.F. Saunders N.F.W. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Nature. 1997; 389: 406-412Google Scholar); the significance of this residue, but not necessarily its religation to thed1 heme iron, for this displacement has been indicated by calculations (17Ranghino G. Scorza E. Sjogren T. Williams P.A. Ricci M. Hajdu J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10958-10966Google Scholar). The driving force for tyrosine 25 to ligate to the oxidized iron of the d1 heme is certainly large. Cytochrome cd1 from P. pantotrophus is exceptional in binding cyanide only when thed1 heme iron is in the ferrous state; cyanide, which normally binds very tightly to ferric hemes, is readily displaced by the tyrosine residue (18Jafferji A. Allen J.W.A. Ferguson S.J. Fülöp V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25089-25094Google Scholar). Finally, there appears to be a very tight coupling between both the oxidation states and coordination at thec and d1 centers that is most clearly illustrated by the highly cooperative and hysteretic redox titration (19Koppenhöfer A. Turner K.L. Allen J.W.A. Chapman S.K. Ferguson S.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4243-4249Google Scholar). It is clear that many aspects of further progress in understanding cytochrome cd1 from P. pantotrophuswill require the preparation of enzyme carrying mutations at the important residues that have been identified by crystallography. This is no easy task, as the very specialized d1 heme is only made by denitrifying bacteria, none of which is an ideal host for site-directed mutation studies. One approach is to make the semi-apoenzyme in vivo and then add thed1 heme in vitro. This has been done for the enzyme from P. aeruginosa, but it requires the preparation of large amounts of wild-type enzyme as a source of thed1 heme (e.g. Ref. 6Cutruzzolà F. Brown K. Wilson E. Bellelli A. Arese M. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Brunori M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2232-2237Google Scholar). Production of an inactive cd1 in P. pantotrophusitself is problematic, as recent work on the expression of thenirS gene has shown that its transcription is activated by nitric oxide, the product of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme (20Van Spanning R.J.M. Houben E. Reijnders W.N.M. Spiro S. Westerhoff H.V. Saunders N. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4129-4132Google Scholar). Furthermore, anaerobic conditions are needed for formation of cytochrome cd1, but use of nitrate as an anaerobic electron acceptor in the absence of an active cytochromecd1 results in accumulation of toxic nitrite. In view of these considerations, we sought in this work to identify a variant form of P. pantotrophus cytochromecd1 that was still active and that might therefore be expressed in P. pantotrophus itself. The recent evidence from several types of study that tyrosine 25 might not be essential for catalysis prompted us to investigate other residues that might be tolerated at this position. Initially, serine was chosen because the P. aeruginosa structure has the hydroxy of tyrosine 10 at approximately the same distance from thed1 heme iron as we estimated the serine hydroxy would be in a putative Y25S mutant of the P. pantotrophusenzyme. Thus, we anticipated that an active and stable folded form of the latter enzyme, perhaps with a hydroxide lying between the serine and the heme iron, analogous to the hydroxide that is the immediate ligand to the d1 heme of the P. aeruginosa enzyme, would be produced. This study reports that this expectation of expression of a mutant form of P. pantotrophus cytochrome cd1 was realized and the properties, including the structure, of the Y25S enzyme. Escherichia coliand P. pantotrophus strains are listed in TableI. Luria broth or agar was routinely used for cultivation of these strains, which was carried out at 37 °C. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 ॖg/ml; kanamycin, 50 ॖg/ml; gentamicin (700 units/mg) 20 ॖg/ml (or 100 ॖg/ml for E. coli); and rifampicin, 20 ॖg/ml. Minimal medium for growth of P. pantotrophus strains was prepared as described by Robertson and Kuenen (21Robertson L.A. Kuenen J.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1983; 129: 2847-2855Google Scholar); 20 mmsuccinate and 20 mm KNO3 were added where appropriate. DNA sequencing was performed using Applied Biosystems BigDye terminators as described by the manufacturer. DNA manipulations and transformations were carried out using standard procedures (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction and modifying enzymes (New England Biolabs Inc.) were used according to the manufacturer's protocols. Southern hybridizations were carried out in 6× SSC (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), 1× Denhardt's solution, and 507 formamide at 42 °C. The nirS gene from P. pantotrophus was mutated such that an EcoRI site was inserted immediately before the start codon, and a HindIII site was inserted immediately after the stop codon (23Gordon E.H.J. Steensma E. Ferguson S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 281: 788-794Google Scholar); the plasmid containing this construct is pEG10 (this has the nirSopen reading frame as well as 125 bp upstream DNA (the nirSpromoter), and ∼600 bp downstream DNA (the start of thenirE gene)). This cassette was then used for further manipulations and mutagenesis of tyrosine 25 to serine. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to Kunkel and Roberts (24Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Google Scholar) using the mutagenic primer 5′-GTCCAGCGAGGGCTCGCAGCGATTGTCGGTGCG-3′. The resultant mutated gene sequence for Y25S nirS was confirmed as correct over its entire length.Table IBacterial strains and plasmids usedStrainCharacteristicsSource/Ref.P. pantotrophus LMD92.63Laboratory stock EGPPrifSpontaneous rifampicin-resistant strainThis study EG6202LMD92.63 ΔnirS::aph KmrThis studyE. coli DH5αsupE44ΔlacU169 (φ80 lacZ ΔM15) hsdR17recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Invitrogen S17-1thi pro hsdR hdsM+recA, chromosomal insertion of RP4-2 (Tc::Mu Km::Tn7)38Simon R.

This fragment was further digested with EcoRI andHindIII to remove the nirS coding sequence. The restriction sites were end-filled with T4 DNA polymerase, and theahp (kanamycin resistance) gene from pRS551 (25Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 53: 85-96Google Scholar), which was excised on a StuI fragment, was ligated to give pEG156. ThisnirS::ahp construct was then excised on a PstI-SphI fragment (the SphI site was end-filled with T4 DNA polymerase) and ligated with pJQ200KS (26Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Google Scholar) cut with SmaI and PstI restriction enzymes. This final plasmid, pEG181, was then used for gene replacement experiments exactly as described by Quandt and Hynes (26Quandt J. Hynes M.F. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 127: 15-21Google Scholar). The resulting strains were subjected to Southern blot hybridization analysis. A custom expression vector was constructed to facilitate expression of nirS and its derivatives inP. pantotrophus. The backbone of this vector was the 5-kbCsp45I-AatII restriction fragment from the broad host range vector pBBR1MCS (27Kovach M.E. Phillips R.W. Elzer P.H. Roop II, R.M. Peterson K.M. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 800-802Google Scholar). The gene encoding kanamycin resistance and fragments coding for the lacI gene, tacpromoter, and rrnB terminators were amplified using PCR methodology from plasmids pHRP310 (28Paralles R.E. Harwood C.S. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 23-30Google Scholar) and pMMB503EH (29Michel L.O. Sandkvist M. Bagdasarian M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 41-45Google Scholar), respectively. Restriction enzyme sites were added to the oligonucleotide primers such that the amplified products had the following constructions:Csp45I-lacI-NheI,XbaI-aph-SacII, andSacII-Ptac-MCS-rrn-AatII. Ligation of these fragments with the 5-kbCsp45I-AatII restriction fragment from pBBR1MCS generated plasmid pEG211, which thus carried the inducible tac promoter, with the lacI gene immediately downstream of the kanamycin gene, such that transcription from the aph gene also resulted in transcription of the lacI gene. A derivative of this plasmid, pEG276, consisted of the aac gene (coding for resistance to gentamycin) from pHRP309 (28Paralles R.E. Harwood C.S. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 133: 23-30Google Scholar) instead of theaph gene. A NsiI restriction site was also inserted immediately before the multiple cloning site, enabling the promoter driving overexpression (in this case, the rhnpromoter from the rrnA operon of Rhodobacter sphaeroides) (30Dryden S.C. Kaplan S.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7267-7277Google Scholar) to be changed easily. This promoter was obtained using primers rhnF (5′-CAACCGCGGCCTCCGGCGACGGGCCTG-3′) and rhnR (5′-ACAATGCATCCGTCACCGTCGCCGTT-3′) such that the former incorporated a SacII restriction site and the latter aNsiI restriction site. Thus, the amplified fragment could be transferred into a promoter-free expression vector to give pEG276. The inoculum for the large-scale culture (as described above) was obtained by first inoculating 50 ml of Luria broth culture (in a 250-ml flask) with a colony from a Luria broth plate that had been freshly streaked with a glycerol stock 2 days earlier. This 50-ml culture was grown for ∼15 h at 37 °C with shaking; 5–10 ml was then used to inoculate a 5-liter culture for enzyme preparation. For the purification of Y25S cytochrome cd1,P. pantotrophus EG6202 cells carrying plasmid pEG607 were grown overnight (∼17 h) at 37 °C in minimal medium with 20 mm succinate and 20 mm KNO3 under the selective pressure of 20 ॖg/ml gentamicin and 50 ॖg/ml kanamycin. It was crucial that diffusion of atmospheric oxygen into the culture was minimized. Hence, either fully filled 5-liter Erlenmeyer flasks with narrow necks and thus small surface area or 5-liter Duran bottles filled up to the neck with minimal medium were used to ensure that the culture was as anaerobic as possible. If a larger surface area of the culture was exposed, then the enhanced rate of oxygen transfer into the respiring culture resulted in formation of mainly semi-apoenzyme lacking the d1 heme. Harvesting and purification procedures were similar to those used for the wild-type enzyme (31Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1211-1212Google Scholar), i.e. a periplasmic preparation was first made using lysozyme. The periplasmic proteins were then loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose fast flow column. Fractions (eluted by a gradient of 0.1–0.5 m NaCl) containing cytochromecd1, as judged by visible absorption spectroscopy, were then applied, following addition of ammonium sulfate to 407 saturation, to a Poros HP2 hydrophobic chromatography column. This column was developed using a gradient of 40–07 ammonium sulfate. Fractions identified as containing cytochromecd1 were finally subjected to gel filtration on Superdex 200 (Amersham Biosciences), which removed small amounts of impurities, to produce material for crystallization. This last step was omitted for samples used in kinetic and spectroscopic measurements. Crystals of the Y25S mutant protein grew under conditions similar to those used for the wild-type enzyme (31Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1211-1212Google Scholar), i.e. from a solution containing 10–20 mg/ml protein in the presence of 2.2–2.4 m ammonium sulfate and 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Data to a resolution of 1.4 Å were collected at 100 K using monochromatic x-rays at a wavelength of 0.934 Å on beam line I711 at the MAX Synchrotron (Lund, Sweden). The refined model of the oxidized protein was used for initial phasing (7Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Google Scholar). The phases were refined using the programs REFMAC (32Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Google Scholar) and CNS (33Brünger A.T.

Visible absorption spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ2 spectrophotometer. Steady-state kinetic assays were performed at 25 °C and pH 7.0 in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer as described previously (3Richter C.D. Allen J.W.A. Higham C.W. Zajicek R.J. Watmough N.J.

Cells of P. pantotrophusΔnirS carrying the Y25S variant of cytochromecd1 grew under anaerobic conditions at a similar initial rate, but to a lower final cell density, as those carrying a plasmid coding for the wild-type enzyme. However, although growth of both wild-type cells and ΔnirS cells carrying the Y25S mutation required anaerobic conditions for production of cytochromecd1, only the latter required extra precautions to minimize entry of oxygen into the cultures (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡).

The PrbA protein has been purified from E. cloacae strain EM using a three-step protocol resulting in a 60-fold increase in specific activity. The molecular mass of the mature enzyme was determined to be 54,619 ± 1 Da by mass spectrometry. It is highly active against a series of parabens with alkyl groups ranging from methyl to butyl, withKm and Vmax values ranging from 0.45 to 0.88 mm and 0.031 to 0.15 mm/min, respectively. The Km and Vmax values for p-nitrophenyl acetate were 3.7 mm and 0.051 mm/min. PrbA hydrolyzed a variety of structurally analogous compounds, with activities larger than 20% relative to propyl paraben for methyl 3-hydroxybenzoate, methyl 4-aminobenzoate, or methyl vanillate. The enzyme showed optimum activity at 31 °C and at pH 7.0. PrbA was able to transesterify parabens with alcohols of increasing chain length from methanol to n-butanol, achieving 64% transesterification of 0.5 mm propyl paraben with 5% methanol within 2 h. PrbA was inhibited by 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-4-phenyl-2-butanone and 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7- amino-2-heptanone (TLCK), withKi values of 0.29 and 0.20 mm, respectively, and was irreversibly inhibited by Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) or diethyl pyrocarbonate. The stoichiometry of addition of DFP to the enzyme was 1:1 and only 1 TLCK molecule was found in TLCK-modified enzyme, as measured by mass spectrometry. Analysis of the tryptic digest of the DFP-modified PrbA demonstrated that the addition of a DFP molecule occurred at Ser-189, indicating the location of the active serine.

Parabens are active over a wide pH range (pH 4–8), are colorless, odorless, nonvolatile, stable, and have a low acute and chronic toxicity and a broad spectrum of activity against molds, yeasts, and bacteria (1Haag T. Loncrini D.F. Cosm. Sci. Technol. Ser. 1984; 1: 63-77Google Scholar). The antimicrobial activity of the parabens increases with increasing alkyl chain length, although limitations on the use of longer chain-length parabens are imposed by their solubility in aqueous media. Hence, the methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl parabens are more commonly used in commercial formulations. Their anti-microbial effectiveness can be enhanced by combining two or more parabens in a formulation, with the total paraben concentration seldom exceeding 0.2–0.3% (2Gottfried N.S. Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 1962; 19: 310-314Google Scholar, 3Rastogi S.C. Schouten A. de Kruijf N. Weijland J.W. Contact Dermatitis. 1995; 32: 28-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Resistance to parabens can lead to the survival and proliferation of microorganisms in commercial products that are normally well stabilized with these antimicrobial agents. One mechanism of resistance of bacteria toward parabens is hydrolysis of their ester bond. There are many such reported cases of resistance to the parabens in the literature. A strain of Cladosporium resinaeisolated from a pharmaceutical suspension containing 0.2% of methyl paraben was able to hydrolyze this paraben (4Sokoloski W.T. Chidester C.G. Honeywell G.E. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1962; 3: 179-187Google Scholar). A strain ofPseudomonas aeruginosa was able to grow and degrade parabens in an antimicrobial preparation used in the formulation of eye drops containing a mixture of methyl and propyl paraben at a total concentration of 0.3% (5Hugo W.B. Foster J.H.S. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 1964; 16: 209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The P. aeruginosa strain 396, isolated from an unpreserved oral formulation, was able to grow in the presence of 0.1–0.2% of methyl and propyl parabens and to hydrolyze propyl paraben to produce p-hydroxybenzoic acid (6Zedan H.H. Serry F.M. Egypt. J. Microbiol. 1984; 19: 41-54Google Scholar). A strain of Burkholderia cepacia isolated from an oil-in-water emulsion containing 0.1–0.2% methyl and propyl parabens was able to hydrolyze both parabens (7Close J.-A. Nielsen P.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1976; 31: 718-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although bacterial resistance to parabens has been reported in several species, there are few reports of specific enzymes with the ability to degrade parabens. The degradation of parabens by the resistant P. aeruginosa strain 396 was proposed to proceed through inducible intra- and extracellular esterases, although these enzymes were not isolated (6Zedan H.H. Serry F.M. Egypt. J. Microbiol. 1984; 19: 41-54Google Scholar). An esterase purified from Aspergillus flavuscapable to hydrolyze depside ester linkages was shown to be active against the methyl and ethyl parabens as part of its substrate specificity profile, although microorganism resistance to the parabens was not reported (8Child J.J. Oka T. Simpson F.J. Krishnamurty H.G. Can. J. Microbiol. 1971; 17: 1455-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Additionally, four different carboxyl esterases capable of hydrolyzing parabens have been identified in human skin and subcutaneous fat tissues. Two such esterases from subcutaneous fat tissues were more active toward short chain parabens, whereas a third one from transformed keratinocytes was more active toward longer chain-length parabens such as butyl paraben (9Lobemeier C. Tschoetschel C. Westie S. Heymann E. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1996; 377: 647-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A strain of Enterobacter cloacae was isolated from a contaminated mineral supplement formulation containing 1700 ppm (11.2 mm) and 180 ppm (1.0 mm) methyl and propyl paraben, respectively. The strain, named EM, was shown to be resistant to parabens through the action of an esterase that hydrolyzed the parabens to p-hydroxybenzoic acid (10Valkova N. Lépine F. Valeanu L. Dupont M.

Here, we report the purification and characterization of the PrbA esterase active against parabens and other analogues. All growth media, including tryptic soy broth and tryptic soy agar were from Difco. The CM-Sepharose Fast Flow was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and the Avicell QMA and SP-5W columns were from Waters (Milford, MA). The methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl parabens and p-hydroxybenzoic acid as well as 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-4-phenyl-2-butanone (TPCK),11-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone (TLCK), diethyl pyrocarbonate, and hydroxylamine were purchased from Sigma. All the paraben analogues, p-nitrophenyl acetate,p-nitrophenol, and n-propanol were purchased from Aldrich. Methanol and ethanol were from EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ), and n-butanol was from A&C American Chemicals (Ville St.-Laurent, Quebec). Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Sequencing-grade modified trypsin was obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Solid-phase extraction of tryptic peptides was carried out on C4 or C18 Ziptips from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Type D nanoflow probe tips for mass spectrometry were from Micromass Canada (Pointe-Claire, QC). A suspension of E. cloacaestrain EM was inoculated at an approximate cell density of 1 × 107 cells/ml in minimal Davis medium containing 1% glucose. The cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C, subsequently collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 20 min, and resuspended in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 5.5. The cells were lysed by a 3-fold French press treatment at a pressure of 1200 p.s.i. followed by a centrifugation step at 18,000 rpm for 45 min and 2 ultracentrifugation steps at 40,000 rpm for 90 min each. The cell-free protein suspension in 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 5.5, was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane (Millipore) before application on the purification columns. The first purification step used a CM-Sepharose Fast Flow column with a 60:40 ratio of 20 mm MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, and 20 mm MES-NaOH containing 1 m NaCl for the first 30 min and followed by a gradient that reached 100% NaCl after 60 min, with a flow rate of 3 ml/min. Enzymatic activity was determined as previously described (10Valkova N. Lépine F. Valeanu L. Dupont M. Labrie L. Bisaillon J.-G. Beaudet R. Shareck F. Villemur R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2404-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and the presence of PrbA was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of the active fractions. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.4. The second purification step, through an Avicell QMA column, used a gradient of 68:32 to 0:100 of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, and 20 mm Tris-HCl containing 1 m NaCl in 60 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mm MES-NaOH buffer, pH 5.5, and subsequently purified through a SP-5W column. The elution gradient was 100:0 to 30:70 of 20 mm MES-NaOH, pH 5.5, and 20 mmMES-NaOH containing 1 m NaCl within 60 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The active fractions were subsequently pooled and stored at −70 °C. All activity tests were done in 5.0 ml of 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing the selected paraben at concentrations of 0.5 or 1.0 mm and at 30 °C. The activity was measured after the addition of 0.2 nm enzyme over an assay time of 5 min. The hydrolysis of the parabens and the amount ofp-hydroxybenzoic acid produced was quantified by HPLC according to the method described previously (10Valkova N. Lépine F. Valeanu L. Dupont M. Labrie L. Bisaillon J.-G. Beaudet R. Shareck F. Villemur R. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 2404-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The specific activities are expressed in mmol of p-hydroxybenzoic acid produced/min/mg of protein. Specific activity measurements were done in triplicate and are reported with the standard deviation. TheKm and Vmax values for the parabens were determined using 10 sequential 2-fold dilutions of 1.0 mm solutions of methyl and propyl paraben and of a 0.5 mm solution of butyl paraben in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8. All Km and Vmax values were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis with the software EZ-Fit 5.0 (Perella Scientific, Amherst, NH). The Km and Vmax measurements for p-nitrophenyl acetate were done in 2.0 ml of 7 consecutive 2-fold dilutions of a 1.0 mm solution in 0.05m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing 4% acetone to which 0.2 nm enzyme were added. The enzyme activity was measured by monitoring the appearance of p-nitrophenol by absorbance readings at 405 nm. The p-nitrophenol produced was quantified based on the calibration curve of a 1.0 mmp-nitrophenol standard in sodium phosphate buffer containing 4% acetone. The background hydrolysis rate of p-nitrophenyl acetate was subtracted from each assay. All substrate analogues, including a reference solution of propyl paraben, were prepared at stock concentrations of 100- 400 μm in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and diluted to 50 μm. All assays with substrate analogues were done with 0.2 nm enzyme as described above, with assay times ranging from 5 to 15 min. The enzyme activity was measured as the amount of substrate hydrolyzed as quantified by HPLC as described above. The thermal stability profile of PrbA was obtained by measuring the enzyme activity with 1.0 mmpropyl paraben according to the assay procedure above in 0.05m sodium phosphate buffer at pH 6.8. The pH stability profile was obtained by measuring the enzyme activity at 30 °C in three different buffer systems. A 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer was used at pH 2.0–3.5 and at 6.0–7.5. A 0.05 msodium citrate buffer was used at pH 4.0–5.5, and a 0.05 msodium borate buffer was used at pH 8.0–9.5. All transesterification assays were done according to the same procedure as the substrate specificity assays using 0.5 mm methyl or propyl paraben in 5.0 ml of 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, containing either 0.5% of methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, orn-butanol, or 5% of methanol or ethanol. All assays were done in triplicate. The measurement of enzyme activity after inhibition with DFP, TPCK, TLCK, or diethyl pyrocarbonate was done according to the same procedure as the substrate specificity assays, using 100 μm propyl paraben. Each inhibitor, at a concentration of 100 μm, was added at the mid-point of the assay, or alternatively, the enzyme was preincubated with the inhibitor for 10 min at 30 °C before the addition of the paraben. Verification of the reversal of the diethyl pyrocarbonate-induced inhibition by hydroxylamine was done by incubating the enzyme and inhibitor for 10 min at 30 °C followed by another 10-min incubation with 200 μm hydroxylamine and the subsequent addition of the paraben. The inhibition constant Ki for TPCK and TLCK was calculated from the relative Km values observed for propyl paraben in the absence of the inhibitors and in the presence of a fixed concentration of 100 μm TPCK or TLCK. The stoichiometry of the addition of DFP or TLCK to PrbA was verified by incubating 5.6 μm PrbA in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, with 100 μm DFP or 3 mm TLCK at 30 °C for 30 min. The modified enzyme was subsequently purified from the sodium phosphate buffer and excess inhibitor by solid-phase extraction with a C4 Ziptip using a 60:40 water:acetonitrile eluent with 0.1% acetic acid to which 10% acetic acid was subsequently added. The molecular weight of the native and modified enzymes was calculated from several mass spectrometry measurements using a Quattro II Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer (Micromass Ltd., Manchester, UK) equipped with a Z spray interface in nanospray. The molecular weight measurements were done in positive electrospray ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 0.7–0.9 kV and a cone voltage of 35–45 V. A concentration of 5.6 μm PrbA in 0.05 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, was incubated with 100 μm DFP at 30 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, this mixture was added to 1 μg/μl trypsin in an equivalent volume of 0.025 mNH4HCO3 buffer, pH 8.2, for an overnight incubation at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were purified by solid-phase extraction with a C18 Ziptip and eluted with a 60:40 water:acetonitrile mixture containing 0.1% acetic acid. Subsequently, the concentration of acetic acid was increased to 10%. Collision-induced dissociation studies of the tryptic peptides were done with argon at 38–42-eV collision energy. Three steps on a cell-free lysate fromE. cloacae strain EM were necessary to purify the esterase PrbA to homogeneity (Table I). The first step, through a CM-Sepharose column, resulted in a 7-fold increase in the specific activity of the enzyme. The second step, using an Avicell QMA column, was the most efficient in isolating PrbA, because the specific activity after this step increased 55-fold relative to the crude extract. The final step, with a SP-5W column, purified the enzyme to homogeneity and slightly increased the specific activity, reaching 60-fold relative to the activity of the initial cell-free extract. The enzyme was purified to homogeneity, as determined by SDS-PAGE, and its molecular mass was calculated at 54.6 kDa. The molecular weight of the enzyme was 54,619 ± 1 Da as measured by mass spectrometry.Table ISpecific activity of PrbA after each purification stepPurification stepTotal enzyme activity1-aAll kinetic assays were done with propyl paraben.Total protein1-bThe protein concentration was measured by the Folin-Lowry assay.Specific activityPurification -foldμmol/minmgμmol/mg.minCell-free extract3.5 × 1061732.0 × 1041.0CM Sepharose1.7 × 10611.71.4 × 1057.0Avicell QMA7.5 × 1050.7141.1 × 10655SP-5W2.5 × 1050.2161.2 × 106601-a All kinetic assays were done with propyl paraben.1-b The protein concentration was measured by the Folin-Lowry assay. Open table in a new tab The specific activities of the purified enzyme were determined with the most commonly used series of parabens, from methyl to butyl paraben, and are shown in TableII. The specific activity of PrbA is greatest with ethyl paraben, reaching 2.71 mmol/min·mg. The specific activity toward methyl paraben is nearly as high, reaching 91% that with ethyl paraben. The activity declines with longer chain-length parabens, reaching 70% activity with propyl paraben and 35% activity with butyl paraben.Table IIPrbA activities toward the methyl to butyl parabens and p-nitrophenyl acetateSubstrateSpecific activityKmVmaxmmol/min·mgmmmm/minMethyl paraben2.46 ± 0.080.880.15Ethyl paraben2.71 ± 0.07—2-aNot determined.—2-aNot determined.Propyl paraben1.91 ± 0.030.600.078Butyl paraben0.942 ± 0.060.450.031p-Nitrophenyl acetate0.2252-bSingle determination.3.70.0512-a Not determined.2-b Single determination. Open table in a new tab The Km and Vmax values were determined for methyl paraben and for the longer chain-length propyl and butyl parabens (Table II). The Km values decrease ∼2-fold as the alkyl chain length increases, from 0.88 mm with methyl paraben to 0.45 mm with butyl paraben. The Vmax values decrease ∼5-fold with increasing chain length, from 0.15 mm/min with methyl paraben to 0.031 mm/min with butyl paraben. TheKm value for p-nitrophenyl acetate is ∼4-fold greater than that obtained with methyl paraben, whereas theVmax value for p-nitrophenyl acetate is closest to the value obtained with butyl paraben. The activity of PrbA toward several structural analogues of the parabens was determined relative to the activity with propyl paraben (Table III). The enzyme activity was highest with propyl paraben, although the activity with methyl 3-hydroxybenzoate was nearly as high, reaching 97%. The second highest activity was obtained with methyl 4-aminobenzoate, at 21%, and with methyl vanillate, at 22%. Similar activities, reaching 12%, were obtained with methyl 3,5-dihydroxybenzoate and ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate. The activity with the remaining substrates, methyl benzoate, methyl 2-aminobenzoate, methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate, and trans-methyl cinnamate ranged from 3 to 6%. PrbA was not able to hydrolyze the ester bond of tert-butyl paraben nor the amide bond of 4-hydroxybenzamide.Table IIIRelative activity of PrbA toward paraben structural analogues3-a The activity is expressed as a percentage of the activity obtained with propyl paraben. Open table in a new tab 3-a The activity is expressed as a percentage of the activity obtained with propyl paraben. The activity profile of PrbA at different temperatures shows an optimum activity at 31 °C and ≥90% activity between the temperatures of 29 and 35 °C. The enzyme retained ≥80% of its activity between 25 and 45 °C and more than 50% activity at 50 °C and 15 °C. The activity of PrbA at different pH values is greatest at pH 7.0, and the enzyme maintains ≥90% of its activity in the pH range 4.5–7.5. The enzyme retains ∼70–80% of its activity at pH values of 4.0 and 8.0. The activity decreases significantly outside of this range, reaching 11% at pH 3.0 and 4% at pH 9.5. The enzyme is completely inactivated at pH 2.5. PrbA was able to transesterify methyl or propyl parabens with 0.5% (v/v) of methanol, ethanol,n-propanol, and n-butanol (TableIV). The rate of disappearance of propyl paraben was 7% higher with methanol than in the buffer alone (1.73 and 1.61 mmol/min·mg, respectively), whereas the rate of formation ofp-hydroxybenzoic acid was 60% slower with methanol than without (0.617 and 1.52 mmol/min·mg, respectively). The rate of disappearance of methyl paraben (1.56 mmol/min·mg) was reduced by 23% in the presence of ethanol and by 60 and 77% withn-propanol and n-butanol, respectively. The rate of formation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid in the presence of either of these three alcohols ranged from 17 to 43% that without any alcohol (1.75 mmol/min·mg). The rate of formation of the corresponding transesterified paraben was ∼50% that of the rate of disappearance of the original paraben with methanol, ethanol, orn-propanol and reached only 14% withn-butanol.Table IVRates of transesterification of methyl paraben with 0.5% ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol and of propyl paraben with 0.5% methanol0.5% AlcoholDisappearance of original parabenFormation of transesterified parabenFormation of p-hydroxybenzoic acidmmol/min·mgmmol/min·mgmmol/min·mg—4-aMethyl paraben alone.1.56 ± 0.07—1.75 ± 0.08—4-bPropyl paraben alone.1.61 ± 0.06—1.52 ± 0.03Methanol1.73 ± 0.070.884 ± 0.060.617 ± 0.05Ethanol1.20 ± 0.030.672 ± 0.020.754 ± 0.03n-Propanol0.619 ± 0.040.303 ± 0.020.434 ± 0.02n-Butanol0.354 ± 0.030.0492 ± 0.0030.303 ± 0.024-a Methyl paraben alone.4-b Propyl paraben alone. Open table in a new tab Additionally, PrbA was able to carry out the efficient transesterification of propyl paraben with 5% (v/v) of methanol (Fig.1). The yield of methyl paraben produced after 2 h was 64% of the initial amount of propyl paraben in solution (0.5 mm), whereas at the same time, the yield of the side product p-hydroxybenzoic acid was minimized to 8% of the amount of propyl paraben initially present. The yield of the transesterified paraben was reproducible, as shown by the low margin of error (Fig. 1). The same transesterification reaction with 5% ethanol was much less rapid under the same conditions. After 2 h, only 13% of the initial propyl paraben was transformed, yielding 10% of ethyl paraben and 2% of p-hydroxybenzoic acid relative to the original amount of propyl paraben (results not shown). Total inhibition of PrbA activity occurred when 100 μm DFP were added at the mid-point of a hydrolysis assay with 100 μm propyl paraben. Complete enzyme inhibition was also obtained under similar conditions by the addition of 100 μm diethyl pyrocarbonate, and a 50% restoration of activity was measured after the addition of 200 μm hydroxylamine to the diethyl pyrocarbonate-modified enzyme (results not shown). The addition of 100 μm TPCK or TLCK under comparable conditions resulted in a 64 and 68% enzyme inhibition, respectively. The inhibition constant Kifor TPCK and TLCK was 292 and 202 μm, respectively. The addition of TPCK or TLCK increased the Km value of PrbA toward propyl paraben by 30–40% and had only a slight impact on the Vmax value, suggesting that both of these compounds act as competitive inhibitors of PrbA (results not shown). The deconvoluted mass spectrum of PrbA after modification with DFP showed only 1 peak at 54,784 ± 1 Da (results not shown). This 164-Da mass increase corresponds to the addition of 1 DFP molecule and the loss of 19 Da from the fluoride leaving group. The single addition of 164 Da confirmed a 1:1 stoichiometry of DFP addition to the enzyme. The DFP-modified PrbA was totally inhibited. The deconvoluted mass spectrum of TLCK-modified PrbA presented the peak of the native enzyme at 54,619 ± 1 Da along with another at 54,948 ± 3 Da, with 17% intensity of the initial peak (results not shown). This mass increase corresponds within the experimental error to the addition of one TLCK molecule, with the loss of 35 Da from the chloride leaving group. No other peak was observed corresponding to multiple addition of TLCK. Only partial modification of PrbA could be achieved at 3 mm TLCK because higher concentrations of TLCK had a suppressing effect on the electrospray ionization of the enzyme. This chemical modification resulted in a partial inhibition of enzyme activity, reducing the activity by 51%. The addition of one DFP molecule to PrbA made the identification of the modified serine possible through collision-induced dissociation studies of the tryptic peptide containing the active site motif GESAGG conserved in many esterases. The full sequence of this tryptic peptide was NIQSFGGDNHNVTLFGESAGGHSVLAQMASPGAK (amino acids 172–205) with a molecular mass of 3399.7 Da. An ion corresponding to the [M + 4H]4+-charged state of this peptide was identified atm/z 851, and a low intensity ion corresponding to the [M + 3H]3+-charged state was found atm/z 1134 (Fig.2A). The ion atm/z 851 was confirmed to represent the active site peptide by collision-induced dissociation, where the y61+–y111+, the y132+–y242+, and the y263+–y333+ ions were identified, spanning nearly the entirety of the peptide sequence as follows: IQSFGGDNXNVTLFGESAGGHXVLAQMA. Additionally, the b202+–b212+ and the b153+ – b173+ ions, corresponding to the sequence FGEXXGG, were observed. The peak at m/z 851 present in the tryptic digest of the native PrbA also represented two other peptides, which were identified by collision-induced dissociation. These peptides did not contain the serine active site motif. The first peptide, in a [M + 2H]2+-charged state, contained the sequence LSILMVDYWTNFAK (amino acids 440–453) and had a molecular mass of 1699.9 Da. This peptide was identified from the series of y5+–y13+ and b5+–b9+fragment ions. The second peptide, in a [M + 3H]3+-charged state, contained the sequence KLPVMVWIPGGGLSSGSGNEYDASK (amino acids 97–121) and had a molecular mass of 2549.9 Da. This peptide was identified from the series of y5+–y17+ and b5+–b9+ fragmentation ions. Upon modification by DFP, an ion at m/z 892 appeared that was not present in the tryptic digest of the native enzyme (Fig. 2B). This ion corresponds to the molecular mass of the active site peptide with the addition of 164 Da from the DFP molecule, corresponding to 3563.7 Da in the [M + 4H]4+-charged state. The [M + 3H]3+ ion, atm/z 1189, was also observed at a low intensity. The charged state of the m/z 892 ion was +4, as confirmed by the 0.25 Da separation of its isotopic peaks. The remaining ion at m/z 851 in the DFP-modified tryptic digest (Fig. 2B) is due to the presence of the two unrelated peptides described above. The tryptic digests of the native and DFP-modified PrbA permitted the identification of a considerable number of peptides besides the active site peptide. A total of 24 peptides were identified from the native PrbA of a theoretical total of 42 tryptic peptides. An additional 5 peptides were identified from tryptic fragments that contained one missed cleavage site, covering 70% of the entire enzyme. In the DFP-modified PrbA, the total number of identified peptides was 23, with an additional 11 peptides identified from fragments with one missed cleavage site, covering 81% of the enzyme. Generally, the same peptides were identified from the native and DFP-modified enzymes, although their relative intensities were different (Fig. 2). Collision-induced dissociation of the m/z 892 ion from the DFP-modified PrbA confirmed that it contained an active serine residue involved in the catalytic site. Although the entire peptide contained four serine residues that DFP could possibly modify, the serine of interest in the GESAGG motif was Ser-189. In the collision-induced dissociation profile of this peptide, fragmentation at Ser-189 corresponds to the y17 ion or b18 ion (Fig.3A). The collision-induced dissociation spectrum of m/z 892 showed the y122+–y242+ ions corresponding to the sequence NVTLFGESAGGH, with a mass addition of 164 Da from the y172+ (Ser) to the y122+ (His) ions, confirming the addition of 164 Da to Ser-189 at m/z 866 (Fig. 3B). The y202+ ion (m/z 1038) is not indicated, because its signal is masked by the intense b182+ ion atm/z 1040. As well, the b112+–b182+ ions corresponding to the sequence VTLF(G)ES were identified as well as the b232+ and b242+ ions, which had an added mass of 164. The missing b162+ ion and several other ions between b182+ and b232+ correspond to the loss of glycine residues, which are often difficult to detect. In addition, the series of y51+–y171+ ions corresponding to the sequence SAGGHSVLAQMA were identified, with a low intensity signal at m/z 1733 for the y171+ ion (Ser-189 + 164 Da) (results not shown). The shift in mass at Ser-189 by 164 Da identifies the site of DFP modification, and the concurrent total loss of activity confirms that Ser-189 is the active serine in the catalytic site. The esterase PrbA was purified from the paraben-resistant strain of E. cloacae EM. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme, as measured by SDS-PAGE, was 55 kDa. This measurement was confirmed by the theoretical molecular mass of the enzyme, calculated from the sequence of amino acids deposited under the GenBankTMaccession number AAL82802, as 54,597 Da (11Valkova N. Lépine F. Bollet C. Dupont M. Villemur R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the enzyme as measured by mass spectrometry was 54,619 ± 1 Da, which corresponds to the addition of 22–23 mass units, possibly from a sodium ion originating from the sodium phosphate buffer. The esterase showed the highest specific activities toward the ethyl, methyl, and propyl parabens, indicating a preference for shorter chain esters (Table II). Although the decreasing Km values with increasing alkyl chain length indicate a higher affinity for the longer chain-length parabens, the higher Vmax values with methyl paraben indicate that the rate of reaction is greatest with shorter chain-length parabens. The affinity of the enzyme forp-nitrophenyl acetate is relatively low, as indicated by aKm value 4-fold higher than that for methyl paraben as well as by a low Vmax value. PrbA showed an almost equal activity toward methyl 3-hydroxybenzoate as for propyl paraben (Table III). However, the activity with methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate was only 3% that with propyl paraben, indicating that the hydroxyl group must be placed in the meta orpara position but not in the ortho position for efficient hydrolysis by PrbA. The presence of two hydroxyl or methoxy group substituents in the para and/or metaposition still results in 12–22% residual activity. The absence of any polar substituent at the para or metaposition leads to only 6% residual activity, as shown with methyl benzoate. The hydroxyl groups at the para position can be substituted by another electron-donating group such as an amine function, as with methyl 4-aminobenzoate, and PrbA still retained 21% of its activity. The analogues methyl 2-hydroxybenzoate and methyl 2-aminobenzoate showed a much reduced reactivity, confirming that the presence of a substituent at the ortho position results in significant loss of enzymatic activity. Interestingly, PrbA was capable of hydrolyzing methyl cinnamate, although in low yields, showing that its activity was not limited only to benzoic ester analogues, as also shown by its activity against para-nitrophenyl acetate. PrbA could not cleave the ester bond of tert-butyl paraben due to the steric hindrance at the carbonyl caused by the bulkyt-butyl group, but utilization of this paraben is hampered by its very limited solubility in water. The activity of PrbA seems to be limited to ester bonds, because it could not cleave the amide bond of the structurally related 4-hydroxybenzamide. It has been previously shown that a P. cepacia strain that could hydrolyze low concentrations of parabens (100 mg/liter) in 3 weeks could also perform the transesterification of ethyl paraben with various alcohols (12Horiuchi K. Morimoto K. Kobashi K. Mitsui T. Suemitsu R. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1994; 77: 324-325Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This transesterification was attributed to an esterase, probably the same that hydrolyzed the paraben. However, the enzyme responsible was not isolated, and the transesterification process, although efficient, required 3 days for 80% conversion of ethyl paraben to methyl paraben with 0.4% of methanol (12Horiuchi K. Morimoto K. Kobashi K. Mitsui T. Suemitsu R. J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1994; 77: 324-325Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The ability of PrbA to carry out paraben transesterification was then investigated with a series of alcohols of increasing chain length ranging from methanol to n-butanol. The efficiency and yield of transesterification was greatest with methanol and ethanol (TableIV) and decreased approximately by half with n-propanol. The yield of butyl paraben obtained upon transesterification withn-butanol was the lowest, reaching only 6% of the yield obtained with methanol. Furthermore, PrbA can carry out efficient transesterification with methanol concentrations as high as 5% within a short period of time (Fig. 1), achieving 64% transesterification in 2 h. The residues involved in the active site of PrbA were investigated. The catalytic site of many esterases contains a catalytic triad composed of an active serine, histidine, and aspartic acid. The presence in the catalytic site of the serine and histidine residues was investigated using reagents known to react selectively with these active residues. The protease inhibitor DFP is known to react selectively with active serine residues (13Wilson B.W. Walker C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Modification of PrbA with DFP resulted in a complete irreversible inhibition with a 1:1 stoichiometry as observed by mass spectrometry. Analysis of the tryptic peptides of the DFP-modified PrbA showed that the modified residue was Ser-189. This serine is part of the sequence GESAGG, which corresponds to the conserved GXSXG motif commonly found in carboxyl esterases (14Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), further confirming the identity of this serine as part of the active site of PrbA. An alignment of the 100 esterases most closely related to PrbA with the protein-protein BLAST engine showed that this motif was conserved among all these esterases. The protease inhibitor TLCK reacts selectively with active histidine residues (15Walls A.F. Brain S.D. Desai A. Jose P.J. Hawkings E. Church M.K. Williams T.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 1243-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Only one molecule of TLCK was found in the modified enzyme. This suggests that the histidine residue that reacted was part of a catalytic triad. At the TLCK concentration used only 17% of the enzyme was modified, as observed by mass spectrometry, whereas the activity was reduced by 51%. This difference could be attributed to the relative instability of TLCK-derivatized histidine, especially at the low pH required (10% acetic acid) for efficient ionization in electrospray. The protein-protein BLAST alignment of the 100 esterases more closely related to PrbA showed that one residue, His-412, was conserved in 98 of the 100 proteins. His-412 was also aligned with the regions of the other esterases containing the motif GdHXD. This motif is commonly found for the histidine in the catalytic triad of serine hydrolases (14Satoh T. Hosokawa M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 257-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), although it was not present within the sequence of PrbA itself. A motif GXXXXEXG, often indicative of the glutamate in the catalytic triad of serine hydrolases, was also located in the same BLAST alignment described above. This region included the highly conserved Glu-307 in PrbA, which was conserved in 98 of the 100 esterases. The glutamate 307 in PrbA was part of a slightly modified GXXXXEG motif, which was also found in several other homologous esterases instead of the GXXXXEXG motif. A small number of esterases have previously been shown to have the ability to hydrolyze parabens, namely from P. cepacia,P. aeruginosa, or from human skin and subcutaneous fat tissue as well as an esterase hydrolyzing depsi-peptide linkages fromA. flavus (6Zedan H.H.

However, none of these enzymes have been isolated or characterized in their purified form, and hence, their amino acid sequence and other biophysical parameters are unknown. The esterase PrbA represents the first fully characterized carboxyl esterase responsible for the hydrolysis of parabens, and it was shown that the E. cloacae strain EM containing the prbAgene was more resistant toward parabens than a E. cloacaereference strain that did not have a paraben-hydrolyzing activity (11Valkova N. Lépine F. Bollet C. Dupont M. Villemur R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). PrbA is most active at physiological pH and at a temperature near 30 °C, which are conditions that often apply to commercial preparations containing parabens. Two prbA genes closely homologous to the prbA gene found in E. cloacae strain EM have been identified in twoEnterobacter gergoviae strains recently isolated in France (11Valkova N. Lépine F. Bollet C. Dupont M. Villemur R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5011-5017Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both strains hydrolyzed parabens, and one of them was more paraben-resistant than a E. gergoviae reference strain. This geographical separation might indicate that homologues of theprbA gene are more widespread than currently known. Hence, the characterization of PrbA is an important step in understanding and limiting the growth of paraben-resistant microorganisms in commercial formulations."

A plausible binding surface on δ-subunit was identified from conservation of amino acid sequence and the high resolution NMR structure. Specific mutations aimed at modulating binding were introduced onto this surface. Affinity of binding of wild-type and mutant δ-subunits to δ-depleted F1 was determined quantitatively using the fluorescence signals of natural δ-Trp-28, inserted δ-Trp-11, or inserted δ-Trp-79. The results demonstrate that helices 1 and 5 in the N-terminal domain of the δ-subunit provide the F1-binding surface of δ. Unexpectedly, mutations that impaired binding between F1and δ were found to not necessarily impair ATP synthase activity. Further investigation revealed that inclusion of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit substantially enhanced affinity of binding of δ-subunit to F1.

In Escherichia coli, ATP synthase consists of a complex of eight subunits, α3β3γδεab2cn. It was defined in earlier times in terms of a membrane-peripheral F1 sector (α3β3γδε) containing three catalytic sites, and a membrane-embedded F0 sector (ab2cn), which carries out transmembrane proton transport. Recent work has demonstrated that the enzyme functions as a rotary motor. The centrally located “rotor” consists of subunits γεcn. At the top, it rotates inside the α3β3 hexagon, and thus modifies the activities of the catalytic sites; at the base, it rotates against subunit a, thereby facilitating proton movement. In this way, the energy of the proton gradient is transduced into the energy of ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Understanding the mechanism by which this occurs is currently of major interest. To ensure that subunits a and α3β3 remain firmly fixed in relation to each other they are connected by a peripheral structure, the “stator” stalk, consisting of subunitsb2 and δ.

The dimer ofb-subunits forms an elongated helical connection between subunit a and the C-terminal domain of the δ-subunit, it lies at one side of the α3β3 hexagon, and its functional domains have been well characterized (4Dunn S.D.

Currently only partial high-resolution structure has been reported for the bsubunit (8Dmitriev O. Jones P.C. Jiang W. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol.

Zhou J. Nakayama R. Dunn S.D. Capaldi R.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 387-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and the homologous mitochondrial OSCP1 subunit also binds at the top of the molecule, with its C-terminal domain at the side (11Rubinstein J.L. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 321: 613-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region of α-subunit (residues α1–15 or α1–19) was shown to be necessary for δ binding by proteolysis experiments (12Dunn S.D. Heppel L.A. Fullmer C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6891-6896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and cross-linking between an inserted Cys at residue α2 and natural Cys residue(s) in δ (13Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A.

In our laboratory, quantitative determination of the affinity of binding between δ-subunit and the α3β3γε complex (also called “δ-depleted F1”), using a novel fluorescence assay dependent upon the fluorescence of the single natural Trp in δ, revealed a Kd of 1.4 nm in the E. coli enzyme (14Weber J.

This is equivalent to a binding energy of ∼50 kJ/mol, approximately equivalent to rotor torque (15Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M.

We were able to show that a fragment of δ containing only N-terminal residues 1–134 2E. coli residue numbers are used throughout. (called δ′) bound with the same affinity as intact δ, demonstrating that all the determinants of binding lie in the N-terminal region of δ (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The structure of the N-terminal domain of δ (residues 2–106 in the fragment δ′) has been determined to high-resolution by NMR (18Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Examination of this structure in combination with homology searches of the sequences of other species of δ and OSCP suggested possible residues that might be involved in binding interaction at the F1/δ interface. Using the quantitative binding assay that we had developed, in combination with mutagenesis, we were able here to test these ideas. From the results, this paper presents the identification of the surface on the δ-subunit that provides interactions with F1. In addition we show that inclusion of the soluble cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit substantially enhanced the affinity of binding of δ-subunit to F1. These were all as described previously (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For measurement of binding of purified δ-subunit to δ-depleted F1, the δ-depleted F1 was the “βW107 F1” from strain pSWM86/DK8 as previously described (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). βW107 F1 contains only the Trp at residue β-107, it has normal functional properties, and has a low Trp background signal in the δ-binding assay. For the ATP-driven proton pumping assay, the δ-depleted F1 was from strain pSWM92/DK8 (δW28L), which is easier to completely deplete of δ-subunit than wild-type F1 (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S.

For mutagenesis of δ, the oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis procedure in which an EcoRI-SmaI fragment from plasmid pJC1 (20Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). After mutagenesis the same fragment was moved back to pJC1, creating a new mutant plasmid that was transformed into strain AH3 for expression of mutant δ (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the δY11W/δW28L and δV79W/δW28L mutants the initial EcoRI-SmaI fragment in M13mp19 was taken from pSWM101, containing the δW28L mutation. New mutations, oligonucleotides and resultant mutant plasmids were as follows: δY11A, GTAGCTCGCCCCGCGGCCAAAGCAGC, plasmid pSWM104, introduces SacII site; δY11W, GGTAGCTCGCCCATGGGCCAAAGCAGC, plasmid pSWM105, introducesNcoI site; δA14L, CCCTACGCCAAGCTAGCTTTTGACTTTGC, plasmid pSWM107, introducesNheI site; δA14D, CCTACGCCAAAGATGCATTTGACTTTGC, plasmid pSWM106, introducesNsiI site; δN75E, CGAAAACGGTCAGGAGCTCATTCGGGTTATGGC, plasmid pSWM113, introducesSacI site; δN75A, CGAAAACGGTCAAGCGCTGATTCGGGTTATG, plasmid pSWM112, introducesEco47III site; δV79A, GAACCTGATTCGGGCCATGGCTGAAAATGG, plasmid pSWM114, introducesNcoI site; δV79W, GAACCTGATTCGGTGGATGGCGGAAAATGGTCG, plasmid pSWM115, introducesEciI site; and δG150D, GTCTGTAATGGCGGACGTTATCATCCG, plasmid pSWM119, introducesEciI site. The soluble form of the cytoplasmic domain of the b subunit namedbST34–156 was expressed from plasmid pJB3 (20Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol.

The procedure followed essentially that described in Ref. 20Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Briefly, six 1-liter cultures of strain pJB3/DK8 were grown and harvested, cells were broken by a French press, and the supernatant fraction was collected after centrifugation. Ammonium sulfate was added to 60% saturation, the pellet was resuspended and dialyzed, the protein was then purified by sequential chromatography on Whatman DE-52 anion exchange resin and by gel filtration on Sephacryl S-100. Buffers were described as in Ref. 20Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar. Yield of bST34–156 was 23 mg of protein/liter of culture. Fig. 1 shows the NMR structure of the N-terminal domain of the δ-subunit of E. coli ATP synthase (18Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) as determined using the proteolytic fragment (δ′) consisting of residues 1–134 (intact δ has 177 residues). As noted in the Introduction, because proteolytic removal of the 43 C-terminal residues has no effect on the affinity for binding to δ-depleted F1 (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), it is highly likely that the domain shown in Fig. 1 contains most, if not all, of the amino acid residues involved in binding of δ to F1. Comparison of the sequences of δ or OSCP from 90 species by BLAST search (21Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71456) Google Scholar) showed that the highly conserved residues are clustered on a relatively small portion of the δ surface, as demonstrated in Fig.2. Because δ sequences are in general not highly conserved, for example, in comparison with those of α- or β-subunits (22Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), it appeared probable that this conserved part of δ, formed by helices 1 and 5 (colored dark blue and yellow, respectively, in Fig. 1), constituted the F1-binding site. We decided to test this hypothesis by mutagenesis of four conserved residues, δ-Tyr-11, δ-Ala-14, δ-Asn-75, and δ-Val-79. From the BLAST search (above) we found the following degrees of conservation of these residues. At position δ-11, Tyr occurred in 95% of species and Phe in 5%; at δ-14, Ala occurred in 90%; at δ-75 Asn occurred in 78% and Asp in 6%; and at δ-79 a hydrophobic residue (Val, Leu, or Ile) occurred in 92% of species. Fig. 2A shows the location of these residues on the hypothesized binding surface.Figure 2Sequence conservation on a proposed binding surface of δ-subunit. A, the surface of the N-terminal domain of δ is shown in the same orientation as in Fig. 1. Strongly conserved or conservatively replaced residues are colored inred; partially conserved residues are colored inpink. The remaining residues of δ (gray) show a high degree of variability. Residues 11 and 14 in helix 1 and 75 and 79 in helix 5 were mutated in this work. Residue 85 was mutated in previous work and is discussed in the text. B, series of views obtained by rotating the molecule in 90° steps. The central depiction shows the molecule from the same angle as in Aabove and in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two mutations were introduced in each of the four conserved positions, namely: δY11A,δY11W; δA14D,δA14L; δN75A,δN75E; δV79A,δV79W. The Ala mutations were designed to give an estimate of the contribution of the natural residue to subunit-subunit binding energy. The introduced Trp residues could give new probes for assaying the interaction of δ with F1 and in both cases they were combined with the δW28L mutation to remove the only naturally occurring Trp in δ. The remaining mutations were designed to perturb binding of δ to F1. The mutation δG150D was included as a control. This mutation is known to completely impair ATP synthase function (23Hazard A.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 418-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but because it occurs in the C-terminal domain of the δ-subunit it is expected to interfere with binding of δ to the b subunit (24McLachlin D.T. Bestard J.A. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15162-15168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and not with binding to F1. For each mutant, we purified δ-subunit following previously published procedures (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Dunn S.D. Chandler J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8646-8651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), except in the cases of δA14D and δG150D, where the concentration of saturated ammonium sulfate necessary to precipitate δ was 50% rather than 32%. Yields ranged from 0.5 to 3 mg/liter culture. Purity of the mutant δ was checked by SDS gels, and in each case was the same as with wild-type as previously shown in Ref.14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar. Each purified mutant δ was assayed to determine the affinity of binding to F1 using the fluorescence assay developed previously (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This assay depends on the fact that binding of δ to F1 that has been depleted of δ produces a large enhancement of fluorescence of the natural δ-Trp-28 residue. As noted above, for the δY11W and δV79W mutants, we removed the natural δ-Trp-28 (by combining with δW28L) and used the new Trp as the probe. For each mutation we also assayed the effect on functionin vivo, by measuring growth of mutant cells on succinate plates or in limiting glucose medium, and we measured effects on ATP-driven proton pumping in vitro by reconstitution with membrane vesicles and δ-depleted F1 using purified mutant δ. Fig.3, A–E, shows the Trp fluorescence spectra of the purified mutant δ-subunits in the absence of F1. Except for the δY11W/W28L and δV79W/W28L mutants (dashed curves in Fig. 3, A and D, respectively), the fluorophor is the natural Trp in position δ-28. Several of the spectra of mutant δ (δA14L, δV79A, and δG150D) resemble closely that of wild-type δ (dotted lines in Fig. 3, A–E) with a maximum at 326 nm, indicating a relatively unpolar environment for the tryptophan side chain. The wavelength position of the spectra for δN75A and δN75E (Fig. 3C) is also very similar; however, the fluorescence intensity is 20–30% higher, suggesting that the mutations caused minor changes in the environment of δ-Trp-28. In the δA14D mutant, the spectrum of δ-Trp-28 was red-shifted by 2 nm, in the δY11A mutant by 5 nm, indicative of an increased polarity experienced by the fluorophor. In general, however, the mutations appeared not to perturb the tertiary structure to any large extent, by this criterion. A tryptophan inserted in position δ-11, in the δY11W/W28L mutant, has an emission maximum of 337 nm (Fig. 3A), suggesting clearly a more polar environment than for δ-Trp-28 in wild-type. A tryptophan in position δ-79 (Fig. 3D) has nearly aqueous surroundings, as indicated by fluorescence maximum at 350 nm of the δV79W/W28L mutant. These data are consistent with the predicted location from the structure (Figs. 1 and 2). Wild-type and most of the mutant δ preparations contained δ-Trp-28 as the sole Trp. The response of the δ-Trp-28 fluorescence upon binding of δ-depleted F1 to wild-type δ is shown in Fig.4A. As described previously (14Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18390-18396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), there was an increase in fluorescence intensity of about 50%, combined with a slight blue-shift (∼4 nm), indicative of a change to a more unpolar environment upon binding. The same change was seen in the δV79A and δG150D mutants (data not shown). In the δN75A and δN75E mutants the fluorescence signal of unbound δ was higher to begin with (Fig. 3C), but the final signal after binding to δ-depleted F1 was very similar to wild-type δ, as in Fig. 4A (data not shown). In the δY11A mutant, which had a lower intensity and a more red-shifted spectrum before addition of F1, the fluorescence increase upon F1 binding was about 40%, and the blue-shift was by 6 nm. Mutants δA14D and δA14L did not show any change in fluorescence under the experimental conditions used (discussed below). The engineered δ-Trp-11, in the δY11W/W28L mutant, experiences a very pronounced fluorescence increase upon F1 binding, by 80–90% at 330 nm, combined with a blue-shift of 4 nm (Fig.4B). In contrast, the fluorescence of the engineered δ-Trp-79, in the δV79W/W28L mutant, is quenched upon F1binding, by about 50% at 350 nm, accompanied by a blue-shift of 14 nm (Fig. 4C). The blue-shifts of all three Trp residues (δ-Trp-11, δ-Trp-28, and δ-Trp-79) reflect a more unpolar environment of the tryptophan side chains upon F1 binding, suggesting that the fluorophors are better shielded from the medium in this state. This, in turn, provides good evidence that all three fluorophors are actually located at, or close to the F1-binding surface on the δ-subunit. These data indicated that for all except the δA14D and δA14L mutants a direct fluorescence assay was available for binding of δ-subunit to δ-depleted F1, and that in the cases of δA14D and δA14L a competition assay would be required. Binding of mutant δ to δ-depleted F1was measured by monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence of δ, either because of the natural δ-Trp-28 or because of the engineered δ-Trp-11 or δ-Trp-79. For each mutant, initially an F1concentration of 0.05 μm was chosen. If this concentration was too high to obtain a reliable Kdvalue (because the resulting titration curve was “stoichiometric,” for example, the curve for wild-type δ in Fig.5A), the titrations were repeated using 0.01 μm F1. If the initial F1 concentration was too low (i.e. the titration curves did not reach saturation), the experiments were repeated using 0.5 μm F1. Typical titration curves are shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and the resultant calculated Kd values are given in TableI. In all cases where a binding stoichiometry could be determined reliably (i.e. with stoichiometric or close-to-stoichiometric binding curves), it was very close to 1 (0.9 to 1.2) mol of δ per mol of F1.Figure 6Fluorescence titrations to assess binding of δ-Asn-75 and δ-Val-79 mutant δ to δ-depleted F1.

Open table in a new tab Binding affinities (Kd) were calculated from the titration curves in Figs. 5 and 6. Both mutations in position δ-11 resulted in a significantly decreased binding affinity. Based on the results obtained with the δY11A mutant, the δ-Tyr-11 side chain in wild-type δ contributes about 12 kJ/mol of binding energy (Table I). In this case, tryptophan is not a good substitute for tyrosine, because the δY11W mutation also causes a loss of close to 12 kJ/mol in binding energy (calculated by comparing δY11W/W28L to δW28L mutant). Titrations with the δA14D and δA14L mutants, even using 0.5 μm F1 and up to 2.5 μm δ, did not result in significant changes in the δ-Trp-28 fluorescence (Fig.5B). One possible explanation is that the binding affinity is so low that even at the highest concentrations used, binding is negligible. In this case, Kd would be >5 μm (and the loss in binding energy >20 kJ/mol). Alternatively, it is possible that binding occurs, but that the mutations affect the interaction between δ and F1 in such a way that the fluorescence of δ-Trp-28 does not respond to binding. To address this question, we performed competition titration experiments, which showed that a 6–10-fold excess of δA14D or δA14L mutant δ-subunit did not significantly reduce binding of wild-type δ. On the basis of these results, we can calculate that theKd for δA14D or δA14L mutant is at least 0.1 μm. Thus, from either calculation, both mutations at residue δ-14 perturb interaction between δ and F1considerably. In position δ-75, neither mutation δN75A nor δN75E has a significant effect on the F1 binding affinity (Fig.6A and Table I). Specifically the results obtained with the δN75A mutant suggest that the natural asparagine side chain does not contribute binding energy. In contrast, the valine side chain of residue δ-Val-79 makes a moderate contribution of about 6 kJ/mol (Table I). A tryptophan in this position strongly interferes with binding to F1, with a loss of binding energy of more than 11 kJ/mol (comparing δV79W/W28L to δW28L). As expected, the mutation δG150D in the C-terminal region of δ, used as a control here, had no effect on F1 binding affinity. Plasmids containing mutant uncH (δ-subunit) genes were transformed into strain AN2015, which contains the chromosomal mutation δ-Trp-28 → stop and is therefore unable to grow by oxidative phosphorylation. All plasmids carrying mutations in positions 11, 14, 75, and 79 of δ were able to restore oxidative phosphorylation, as demonstrated by their growth yields on limiting glucose (TableII) and their ability to grow on plates containing succinate as the sole carbon source (not shown). In contrast, the mutation δG150D prevented ATP synthesis by the ATP synthase in vivo (Table II).Table IIEffect of mutations in δ-subunit on growth of cells in vivo and ATP-driven proton pumping in vitroMutationGrowth yieldATP-driven H+-pumping% of wild-type% quenchWild-type10084 (852-aMembranes reconstituted directly with wild-type F1, not δ-depleted.)unc− (pUC118)52δW28L10182δY11A10079δY11W/W28L10174δA14D9872δA14L9374δN75A9980δN75E10077δV79A9977δV79W/W28L9877δG150D500Growth yields in limiting glucose medium and ATP-driven proton pumping in membrane vesicles were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the former, plasmid containing wild-type or mutant δ (uncH) gene was transformed into strain AN2015, which contains a nonsense mutation δW28stop.

Open table in a new tab Growth yields in limiting glucose medium and ATP-driven proton pumping in membrane vesicles were measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” For the former, plasmid containing wild-type or mutant δ (uncH) gene was transformed into strain AN2015, which contains a nonsense mutation δW28stop. For the latter, 500 μg of KSCN-stripped membranes were reconstituted with 100 μg of δ-depleted F1 plus 10 μg of wild-type or mutant δ-subunit, and ATP-induced quench of acridine orange fluorescence was measured. KSCN-stripped membranes were reconstituted with wild-type or mutant δ together with δ-depleted F1 and proton pumping was initiated by addition of ATP. It was found that none of the mutants at positions 11, 14, 75, or 79 of δ caused significant impairment of ATP-driven H+ pumping (Table II). These data indicate that, in the presence of intact F0, functional binding of the mutant δ-subunits to F1 did occur. From the considerations presented in the Introduction, one likely mechanism for such an effect would be through involvement of the bsubunit dimer, and specifically the cytoplasmic domain of bthat interacts with δ. In contrast, the δG150D mutant prevented formation of a proton gradient upon ATP hydrolysis (Table II) as expected from previous work (23Hazard A.L. Senior A.E. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of L. major TS-DHFR revealed a shallow, basic residue-rich groove connecting the two enzyme active sites (1Knighton D.R. Kan C-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Based on this structural finding, it has been proposed that the negatively charged dihydrofolate (H2folate) produced at the TS active site is electrostatically channeled to the DHFR active site, where it is converted to tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) without equilibration in bulk solvent (1Knighton D.R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The shallow groove region is unique to bifunctional TS-DHFR enzymes; however, how channeling occurs and its physiological significance has not been completely established. We used two concurrent approaches to address this issue: the first being mutagenesis of solvent-exposed basic residues thought to play key roles if the channeling behavior is electrostatic in nature. 2C. E. Atreya, E. F. Johnson, J. Williamson, S-Y. Chang, P-H. Liang, and K. S. Anderson, unpublished data. Our second approach, presented here, is to attempt to physically obstruct channeling and/or domain-domain communication. In the case of tryptophan synthase, where substrate channeling occurs through a hydrophobic tunnel, mutation alone was sufficient to obstruct channeling (4Schlichting I. Yang X-J. Miles E.W. Kim A.Y. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 43: 26591-26593Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). With TS-DHFR our approach was to identify small molecules that may bind in various areas within the shallow electrostatic groove and to examine their ability to inhibit enzymatic activity as well as parasite growth in cell culture. In an effort to discover an inhibitor that would bind in the unique shallow groove region of the bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme, we turned to molecular docking screens of the Available Chemicals Directory (ACD) data base. Such a strategy has been previously used to discover novel inhibitors of monofunctional TS, where a competitive inhibitor found by screening with the program NWU DOCK (5Lorber D.M. Shoichet B.K.

In addition, a preliminary DOCK screen produced a 900 μmnon-competitive TS active-site inhibitor: a subsequent similarity search yielded derivatives with Ki values of less than 10 μm (9Shoichet B.K. Stroud R.M. Santi D.V. Kuntz I.D. Perry K.M. Science. 1993; 259: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). More broadly, both monofunctional TS and DHFR enzymes have been the foci of intense structure-based design efforts and are considered model enzymes for such projects (10Jones T.R. Webber S.E.

An unusual aspect of this project was the targeting of sites in the bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme located in regions remote from the active sites. Enzyme active sites have traditionally served as the basis of structure-based drug discovery because they represent well defined and highly functionalized targets. By contrast, the shallow groove connecting the TS and DHFR active sites in bifunctional enzymes presents a particular challenge to structure-based efforts, including molecular docking. Successful targeting of the shallow groove region connecting the two active sites and forming the putative channel could produce novel and more specific therapies for protozoal diseases including toxoplasmosis and drug-resistant malaria. Several docking searches were performed against subregions of a surface area of ∼20 × 25 Å thought to define the central region of the electrostatic channel in L. major TS-DHFR (Fig.1A). This area includes the basic residues Lys-66, -67, -72, -73, -282 and Arg-64, -283, and -287, believed to be involved in shuttling the intermediate substrate, dihydrofolate, between the two catalytic sites (1Knighton D.R.

Four subregions of the putative channel were screened against the 152,571 compounds in the 1995.2 version of the ACD of commercially available chemicals. From these screens, 14 compounds were purchased for testing as inhibitors of TS-DHFR (Table I).Table IDOCK hits testedView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Open table in a new tab We report here that eosin B, predicted by DOCK to bind in the shallow groove region of the putative channel including Arg-283 in the TS domain and Glu-151 in the DHFR domain (Fig. 1B), inhibits the bifunctional enzyme.

Whereas related halogenated fluorescein derivatives are thought to be nonspecific inhibitors of several enzymes, acting through an aggregation-based mechanism, extensive kinetic characterization suggests that eosin B is inhibiting the bifunctional enzyme specifically (14McGovern S.L. Caselli E. Grigorieff N. Shoichet B.K. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 1712-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). All docking calculations were performed with the December 1999 development version of NWU DOCK, a version derived from UCSF DOCK 3.5. This version incorporates the ensemble method of ligand flexibility for up to 2000 conformations per molecule (5Lorber D.M. Shoichet B.K. Protein Sci. 1998; 4: 938-950Crossref Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The polar and non-polar close contact limits used in the steric grids were 2.3 and 2.6 Å (15Shoichet B.K. Bodian D.L. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 380-397Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The AMBER united atom charge set, distributed with Delphi, was used for all receptor electrostatic calculations. CHEMGRID was used to calculate a van der Waals potential for the enzyme using standard potentials (16Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. Comput.

Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) in the matching calculation. This involves labeling site positions or atoms by chemical properties to speed the docking calculation. Here, five labels were employed: positive, negative, hydrogen bond donor, hydrogen bond acceptor, and neutral. All water molecules and counterions were removed from the receptor model. We used the L. major TS-DHFR coordinates provided to us by Dr. David Matthews (1Knighton D.R. Kan C-C. Howland E. Janson C.A. Hostomska Z. Welsh K.M. Matthews D.A. Nat. Struct.

The internal and external dielectrics in the hydration calculation were also set to 2 and 78. In the DelPhi calculation the probe size was set to 1.4 Å. Atomic van der Waals radii for the protein and the ligand were taken from Rashin (19Rashin A.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 1725-1733Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In the Delphi calculation, the ionic exclusion radius was set to 2 Å and the ionic molarity was set to 0.1 m. The proper values of ligand and protein dielectrics, probe, van der Waals, and ionic radii are active areas of research; we have not tried to optimize these terms. In the receptor potential calculation, three-step focusing (20Gilson M.K. Honig B.H. Nature. 1987; 330: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) was used with protein containment iteratively set to 20, 60, and 90% with a 65.3 A3 lattice. All data base searches used the same 152,571 molecule subset of the 1995.2 release of the ACD (21Guner O.F. Hughes D.W. Dumont L.M. J. Chem. Inf. Comput.

Chem. 1992; 13: 505-524Crossref Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and included most of the molecules in the ACD-3D. Partial atomic charges were calculated by the method of Gasteiger and Marsili (22Gasteiger J. Marsili M. Tetrahedron. 1980; 36: 3219-3288Crossref Scopus (3627) Google Scholar). Ligand solvation corrections were calculated using HYDREN (15Shoichet B.K. Bodian D.L. Kuntz I.D. J. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 380-397Crossref Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The shallow groove region between the TS and DHFR-binding sites was explored using sets of spheres to describe the channel. Spheres were prepared starting from the sphgen program and filtered through the cluster program (16Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. Comput.

Eosin B, ACD code MFCD00005041, scored −14.2 kcal/mol in run 7, placing its rank as 198 of 152,571 molecules. The best energy score in the same run was −37 kcal/mol. All buffers and other reagents employed were of the highest chemical purity. Millipore ultrapure water was used for all solutions. CH2H4folate and H2folate were purchased from Schircks Laboratories (Switzerland). H4folate was synthesized by reduction of folic acid with sodium borohydride. Tritium-labeled H2folate and CH2H4folate were synthesized using tritiated folic acid as a starting material: [3′,5′,7,9-3H]folic acid was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Tritium-labeled H2folate was chemically prepared from the reduction of folate by sodium hydrosulfite (25Blakley R.L. Nature. 1960; 188: 231-232Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Tritiated CH2H4folate was prepared enzymatically: tritium-labeled H2folate was converted to tritiated H4folate by L. major TS-DHFR + NADPH (DHFR reaction), and condensed with formaldehyde to form CH2H4folate. The natural (6R)-l-CH2H4folate enantiomer was purified by DE-52 anion exchange chromatography (Whatman) and used exclusively in the studies. H2folate and CH2H4folate solutions were stored in argon-purged vials at −80 °C. NADPH and dUMP were purchased from Sigma; the concentration of NADPH was determined by using a molar extinction coefficient of 6220 m−1cm−1 at 340 nm. Eosin B was purchased from ABCR (A Better Choice for Research Chemicals, Karlsruhe, Germany); fluorescein and phenolphthalein were purchased from Sigma. The clone of the wild-type bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme fromL. major was a generous gift from C.-C. Kan and D. Matthews, then at Agouron Pharmaceuticals. This clone, harboring the pO2CLSA-4 plasmid in an Escherichia coli Rue 10 expression vector, was used to obtain protein of high purity (>99%) using previously described methods for purification (26Grumont R. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3776-3784Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The wild-type protein has both thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase activities similar to those previously reported (26Grumont R. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V.

The R283E mutation was made using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A plasmid containing the desired mutation, as confirmed by nucleic acid sequencing, was used to transform competent BL21. We are grateful to David Roos for theToxoplasma gondii TS-DHFR clone; to Sydney Hoeltzli and Carl Frieden for an E. coli DHFR clone; to Louise Wallace and Bob Matthews for E. coli DHFR protein; and to Frank Maley forE. coli TS protein. The TS-DHFR protein concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically at 280 nm by using an extinction coefficient of 67,800 m−1 cm−1 for L. major and 78,800 m−1 cm−1for T. gondii TS-DHFR. The DHFR activity was determined by following the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanies the conversion of substrates NADPH and H2folate to products NADP+ and H4F (= −12.8 mm−1 cm−1) as described previously. The TS activity was monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 340 nm that accompanies the conversion of substrates dUMP and CH2H4folate to dTMP and H2folate (=6.4 mm−1cm−1) (4Schlichting I.

The reactions were initiated by mixing the 15-μl enzyme solution (0.1–1 μm enzyme; 2× reaction buffer: 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8; saturating NADPH and dUMP; and eosin B in Me2SO or Me2SO alone as control) with the 15 μl of CH2H4folate. 4% of the final reaction volume was reserved for eosin (1 mm eosin B, final) or Me2SO (control). The enzyme solution was reacted with 15 μl of substrate: 100–200 μm tritiated CH2H4folate (∼20,000 dpm). In all cases, concentrations of enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing. The reactions were terminated by quenching with 67 μl of 0.78 n KOH to give a final concentration of 0.54n KOH (2Liang P-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The rapid chemical quench experiments were performed using a Kintek RFQ-3 rapid chemical quench apparatus (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX). Fresh stocks of 25 mm eosin B in Me2SO were made prior to each experiment. The final reaction volume was 30 μl; 4% of this was reserved for eosin B (1 mm eosin B, final) or Me2SO (control). The single enzyme turnover reaction was initiated by mixing the 15 μl of enzyme solution (enzyme + 2× reaction buffer) with the tritiated substrates (15 μl, approximately 20,000 dpm); in all cases, concentrations of enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing. The TS-DHFR single enzyme turnover reaction was monitored by addition of tritiated CH2H4folate to enzyme + NADPH and dUMP. The DHFR reaction was monitored by addition of tritiated H2folate to enzyme + NADPH. The enzymatic reactions were terminated by quenching with 67 μl of 0.78n KOH to give a final concentration of 0.54 nKOH (for more details, see Liang and Anderson (2Liang P-H. Anderson K.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12195-12205Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). The rate constants for individual single-turnover rapid chemical or burst quench experiments were estimated by fitting the data to a single exponential or burst curve using the curve fitting program, Kaleidagraph. Tritiated products of the rapid quench experiments were quantified by HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) in combination with a radioactivity flow detector. The HPLC separation was performed using a BDS Hypersil C18 reverse phase column (250 × 4.6 mm, Keystone Scientific, Bellefonte, PA) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. An isocratic separation using a solvent system of 10% methanol in 180 mm triethylammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0, was employed. The elution times were as follows: H4folate, 9 min, H2folate, 18 min; CH2H4folate, 20 min. The HPLC effluent from the column was mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (Monoflow V, National Diagnostics) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Radioactivity was monitored continuously using a Flo-One radioactivity-flow detector (Packard Instrument Co.). The analysis system was automated using a Waters 712B WISP (Milford, MA) autosampler. A homology model of T. gondii TS-DHFR was built using the Swiss Protein Database program in conjunction with the Swiss Model homology modeling link available at the Swiss Protein Database website. The C-terminal 315 amino acids (residues 295–610) and residues 115–166 were modeled using the protein database file for the L. major TS-DHFR structure. The N-terminal 52 amino acids were modeled using the protein database file forPneumocystis carinii DHFR, which is the highest homology DHFR relative to the N-terminal portion of theT. gondii DHFR domain for which a structure was available. Chinese hamster ovary cells were grown as monolayers at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (100 units/ml per 100 μg/ml). The RH strain tachyzoite of T. gondii was used and maintained by in vitro culture in human foreskin fibroblast cells as described previously (29Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morissette N.S. Moulton A.L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary cells were seeded in triplicate at a density of 2 × 104 cells/ml in a 24-well plate, allowed to attach for 24 h, and then infected with T. gondii. Parasite cultures were synchronized by removal of parasites that had not yet invaded 4 h after their inoculation into confluent cells. After incubation with various concentrations of eosin B for 24 h,T. gondii viability was evaluated 24 h postinfection by measurement of [3H]uracil incorporated into the parasite nucleic acids. Briefly, 1 μCi of radiolabel was added to each well for 2 h before the monolayers were fixed with trichloroacetic acid, rinsed, and counted as described (30Nakaar V. Samuel B.U. Ngo E.O. Joiner K.A.

To prepare the site for docking, all water and ion molecules were removed. Protonation of receptor residues and water molecules was done with Sybyl (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Positions of some protons were then rotated manually to more appropriate orientations using MidasPlus (24Ferrin T.E. Huang C.C. Jarvis L.E. Langridge R. J. Mol. Graph. 1988; 6 (36–37): 13-27Crossref Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The sphere set used contained 57 spheres and was obtained from reclustering spheres obtained from the sphgen program, part of the DOCK 3.5 package (17Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Force field and electrostatic grids were calculated with CHEMGRID (16Meng E.C. Shoichet B.K. Kuntz I.D. Comput. Chem. 1992; 13: 505-524Crossref Scopus (866) Google Scholar) and DelPhi (20Gilson M.K. Honig B.H. Nature. 1987; 330: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), respectively. DISTMAP was used to calculate the excluded volume grid (31Li J.B. Zhu T.H. Cramer C.J. Truhlar D.G. J. Phys. Chem. 1998; 102: 1820-1831Crossref Scopus (277) Google Scholar). On average, 3000 orientations and up to 2000 conformations were calculated in the site for each data base molecule. Molecules were scored and ranked based on their van der Waals and electrostatic complementarity to the putative channeling region, and corrected for polar and non-polar desolvation effects (6Shoichet B.K. Leach A.R. Kuntz I.D. Proteins. 1999; 34: 4-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The docking calculation took 23 h on an Intel Pentium III 450 MHz CPU. 400 high scoring compounds were visually evaluated in the site in their docked conformations. Based on observed complementarity, and with an eye for testing different scaffolds, 14 compounds were ultimately ordered and tested for inhibition of TS-DHFR (TableI). Of these, one (eosin B) showed significant enzyme inhibition when tested at micromolar concentrations (below). A preliminary steady-state screening of DOCK hits indicated that eosin B inhibits the bifunctional TS-DHFR reaction, in which CH2H4folate is converted to H4folate. Steady-state time courses for the reaction of 0.1 μmL. major TS-DHFR with 200 μm CH2H4folate in the presence of 0, 62, 125, or 250 μm eosin B revealed an IC50 of 100 μm (Fig.2A). To evaluate whether the inhibitory activity of eosin B would translate to a similar bifunctional enzyme, the TS-DHFR from T. gondii was examined. Steady-state time courses for the reaction of 1.5 μmT. gondii TS-DHFR with 500 μmCH2H4folate in the presence of varying concentrations of eosin B yielded an IC50 of 180 μm (Fig. 2B). In each case, steady-state inhibition by eosin B is saturable; at high eosin B concentrations complete inhibition is achieved. In steady-state experiments where either 0.1 or 1 μmL. major TS-DHFR was reacted with 100 μmCH2H4folate in the presence or absence of 125 μm eosin B, ∼50% inhibition was observed at both enzyme concentrations (data not shown). These data indicate that the enzyme inhibition is not dependent on enzyme concentration. Transient kinetic analysis was used to obtain a more detailed characterization of the action of eosin, including effects on the single enzyme turnover rates of the TS and DHFR reactions individually, as well as in the bifunctional TS-DHFR reaction, and to look for a build-up of dihydrofolate that may suggest evidence of impaired channeling. Whereas steady-state kinetic analysis is an indirect method from which one can infer information about the rate-limiting step of an enzymatic reaction, transient kinetics allows one to directly measure individual steps in a kinetic pathway as well as to define the reaction kinetics of intermediate formation. Transient kinetics has several advantages for investigation of substrate channeling because, in principle, this technique enables one to directly monitor chemical catalysis at each active site as well as the transit of the putative intermediate from one active site to another (32Anderson K.S. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 308: 111-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 33Anderson K.S. Johnson K.A. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1131-1149Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Single enzyme turnover experiments, which measure the rate of the chemical conversion of substrate to product at the active site under conditions where enzyme concentration is sufficiently high that substrate binding is not rate-limiting, were performed using a rapid chemical quench apparatus. For each single enzyme turnover experiment, full time courses for L. major in the presence and absence of 1 mm eosin B were completed in duplicate, along witht = 0 and t = 60 s controls. Because eosin B was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, an equivalent amount of Me2SO (4% of final volume) was added to control reactions. This concentration of Me2SO has no effect on the single-turnover reaction rates (data not shown). To monitor the DHFR reaction, the bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme (50 μm) was preincubated with a saturating concentration of NADPH (500 μm) and then mixed with a limiting amount of radiolabeled H2folate (14 or 15 μm). To monitor the TS reaction, the bifunctional TS-DHFR enzyme (50 μm) was preincubated with a saturating concentration of dUMP (500 μm) and then mixed with a limiting amount of radiolabeled CH2H4folate (10 or 12.5 μm). The bifunctional TS-DHFR single enzyme turnover experiment was set up similar to that for TS, except that saturating NADPH (500 μm) was added as well as dUMP. All reported concentrations are final, after mixing. Eosin B was found to inhibit both the TS and DHFR reactions, but TS was inh"

By testing the effects of serial N- and C-terminal deletions of the 723-amino acid Schizosaccharomyces pombeFcp1, we defined a minimal phosphatase domain spanning amino acids 156–580. We employed site-directed mutagenesis (introducing 24 mutations at 14 conserved positions) to locate candidate catalytic residues. We found that alanine substitutions for Arg223, Asp258, Lys280, Asp297, and Asp298 abrogated the phosphatase activity with eitherp-nitrophenyl phosphate or CTD-PO4 as substrates. Structure-activity relationships were determined by introducing conservative substitutions at each essential position. Our results, together with previous mutational studies, highlight a constellation of seven amino acids (Asp170, Asp172, Arg223, Asp258, Lys280, Asp297, and Asp298) that are conserved in all Fcp1 orthologs and likely comprise the active site. Five of these residues (Asp170, Asp172, Lys280, Asp297, and Asp298) are conserved at the active site of T4 polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase, suggesting that Fcp1 and T4 phosphatase are structurally and mechanistically related members of the DXD phosphotransferase superfamily.

The CTD undergoes a cycle of extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at positions Ser5 and Ser2, which is coordinated with the transcription cycle and is responsive to stress and developmental cues. A general picture of CTD phosphorylation dynamics has emerged in which dephosphorylated pol II is recruited to the preinitiation complex and CTD phosphorylation ensues shortly after the elongation complex is established (1Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of the CTD is apparently remodeled during its transit along the gene, the purpose of which may be to control the ingress and egress of the mRNA processing assemblies that modify the nascent transcript (1Kobor M.S.

Fcp1 orthologs are present in all known eukaryal proteomes, and the enzyme is essential for cell viability in budding and fission yeast (7,10). Fcp1 catalyzes the metal-dependent hydrolysis of phosphoserine from the CTD in the context of the pol II elongation complex or isolated pol II and, in the case of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Fcp1, from synthetic CTD phosphopeptide substrates. Fcp1 also hydrolyzes the nonspecific substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The mechanism of the Fcp1 reaction is not known.We are undertaking via site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical methods to dissect the domain structure of S. pombe Fcp1 and localize the essential constituents of the active site. We initially characterized catalytically active deletion mutants Fcp1(140–723) and Fcp1(1–580) and identified two acidic side chains, Asp170and Asp172, as essential for phosphatase activity (11Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we delineate a minimal phosphatase catalytic domain, Fcp1(156–580). To map the active site, we introduced alanine and conservative mutations at 14 residues of S. pombe Fcp1 that are invariant in Fcp1 orthologs from other eukarya (see Fig. 1). We thereby identified five new residues that are essential for catalysis and likely comprise the phosphatase active site. Our results consolidate the hypothesis that Fcp1 belongs to the DXDXT family of phosphotransferases (9Cho H. Kim T. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D.

A plausible catalytic mechanism for Fcp1 is suggested based on the concordance of mutational data for Fcp1 and the polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase domain of bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase.DISCUSSIONHere we employed site-directed mutagenesis to define a minimal catalytic domain and identify five new essential amino acids of theS. pombe CTD phosphatase Fcp1.

The apparent minimal catalytic domain is Fcp1(156–580), which consists of an Fcp1 homology domain (shown in Fig. 1) linked to a downstream BRCT domain. An earlier in vivo deletion analysis of S. cerevisiae Fcp1 showed that removal of the N-terminal region upstream of the Fcp1 homology domain did not affect cell viability nor did removal of the C-terminal segment downstream of the BRCT domain. However, simultaneous deletion of both N- and C-terminal segments was lethal in vivo (17Kobor M.S. Simon L.D. Omichinski J. Zhong G. Archambault J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7438-7449Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The present biochemical analysis ofS. pombe Fcp1 shows clearly that the flanking N- and C-terminal domains are not essential for phosphatase activity, either with pNØP or CTD-PO4. It is therefore likely that the seemingly redundant in vivo roles of the N- and C-terminal domains of yeast Fcp1 have more to do with ancillary functions, such as protein-protein interactions (17Kobor M.S.

A short conserved peptide motif (167LIVDLDQTII176 in S. pombe Fcp1) located near the N-terminal margin of the minimal catalytic domain corresponds to the signature sequence of the DXDXT family of metal-dependent phosphohydrolases and phosphotransferases (20Collet J.F.

Given that the two aspartates in the DXDXT element of Fcp1 were found previously to be essential for Fcp1 phosphatase activity (11Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Cell. 1999; 4: 55-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), it was suggested that Fcp1 is a member of the DXDXT superfamily. However, a DXD motif is also a defining feature of the “Toprim” domains found in another class of phosphoryl transfer enzymes (including DNA topoisomerases IA, and II and DNA primases), which do not form acyl-phosphate intermediates (26Aravind L. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4205-4213Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 27Nichols M.D. DeAngeli K. Keck J.L. Berger J.M.

In the Toprim enzymes, the DXD motif coordinates a divalent cation.In the absence of an atomic structure for Fcp1, we rely on primary structure and mutational analysis for clues to which family Fcp1 might belong. However, amino acid sequence searches reveal little similarity, exclusive of the DXD motif itself, between Fcp1 and the several DXDXT family members for which atomic structures are available. Nonetheless, instructive clues emerged from a comparison of the mutational results for Fcp1 to those obtained for the polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase domain of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pnk), which also contains a signature DXDXT motif (Fig.1). The active site of the Pnk phosphatase domain has been mapped by extensive site-directed mutagenesis. The 10 side chains essential for catalysis include six aspartates, two arginines, one lysine, and one serine (13Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol.

Zhu and S. Shuman, unpublished data. The amino acid composition of the Pnk active site is generally similar to the constellation of essential residues of S. pombe Fcp1, which consists, to date, of five aspartates, one arginine, and one lysine. The most upstream essential residues in the Pnk and Fcp1 sequences are the DXDXT motif aspartates (165DVDGT169 in Pnk;170DLDQT174 in S. pombe Fcp1). Indeed, the N termini of Pnk and Fcp1 can be deleted to within ∼15 amino acids of the first catalytic aspartate without significant loss of phosphatase activity (15Wang L.K. Lima C.D. Shuman S.

The distal ends of the Pnk and Fcp1 active sites map to a conserved motif defined by two vicinal essential aspartates, which are preceded by a hydrophobic cluster and then followed by an conserved arginine and a second cluster of hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1). The sequence of this “DD” motif in Pnk is274LAIDDRTQVVEM285, and its putative equivalent in Fcp1 is 294VVIDDRGDVWDW305 (Fig. 1). Note that the length of the polypeptide segment separating the DXD and DD motifs is quite similar in Pnk and Fcp1. The occurrence of two signature motifs with similar order and spacing plus the concordant mutational findings for the two aspartates of the DD motif of Fcp1 and Pnk (14Wang L.K. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 1073-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)2 leads us to posit that the Fcp1 and Pnk phosphatase domains are structurally and mechanistically related. The crystal structure of Pnk shows that the fold of the Pnk1 phosphatase domain resembles that of the exemplary DXDXT family member, Methanococcus jannaschii phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) (16Galburt E.A. Pelletier J. Wilson G. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1249-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). 3L. Wang, S. Shuman, and C. Lima, unpublished data. Thus, we infer that Fcp1 is also a bona fide member of the DXDXT superfamily.Elegant crystallographic snapshots have been obtained for PSP at sequential intermediate states of the catalytic cycle, which reveal the role of the DXD motif in catalysis (24Cho H.S. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D.E. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R.

The proximal Asp plays two key functions: Oδ1 attacks the phosphorus of the substrate to form the acyl-phosphate intermediate, while Oδ2 is part of the octahedral coordination complex of the essential divalent cation cofactor. The distal aspartate of the DXD motif of PSP acts as a general acid-base catalyst: it donates a proton to the serine leaving group during the first phosphoryl transfer step, and it abstracts a proton from the attacking water during the second hydrolytic step. We infer that Fcp1 employs a similar mechanism of acid-base catalysis via an acyl-phosphate intermediate. We had inferred previously from the pH profile of S. pombe Fcp1 the existence of at least two different functional groups at which the protonation state has a strong impact on phosphatase activity (11Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We would now attribute the falloff in catalysis between pH 5.5/5.0 and pH 4.5 to protonation of the proximal Asp nucleophile of the DXD active site motif. To explain the decline in activity as the pH was increased above neutrality, we had invoked a requirement for protonated functional group on Fcp1 enzyme and discussed a potential histidine general acid with a presumptive pKa of ∼6.5. The present mutational analysis vitiates the idea that either of the two conserved Fcp1 histidines might play such a role. Rather, the PSP structure and the sum of the mutational data focus attention on Asp172 of the Fcp1 DXD motif as a potential source of the activity decrement of S. pombe Fcp1 at alkaline pH, i.e. via deprotonation of the Asp general acid.The PSP crystal structure highlights a lysine side chain that interacts with the phosphate in the ground state and stabilizes the pentacoordinate phosphorane transition state (24Cho H.S. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D.E. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R.

The equivalent essential lysine in the phosphatase domain of Pnk (Lys258) is located 19 aa upstream of the DD motif of Pnk. As shown here, Fcp1 also has an essential lysine (Lys280) situated 17 aa upstream of its DD motif. The structure-activity relationships at Pnk Lys258 and Fcp1 Lys280 are concordant with each other (i.e. neither arginine nor glutamine could replace the essential lysine in Pnk or Fcp1), and the functional data are consistent with the monovalent phosphate contact seen for the catalytic lysine in the PSP crystal.It is notable that PSP and most other proteins classified as DXDXT phosphatases have no precise counterpart in their primary structures of the DD motif present in Pnk and Fcp1. Rather, the structural superposition of PSP and Pnk shows that two aspartate side chains of PSP within a167DXXXD171 motif occupy positions at the active site that overlay with the two aspartates of the DD motif of Pnk (16Galburt E.A. Pelletier J. Wilson G. Stoddard B.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 1249-1260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Note that the proximal Asp277 of the277DD278 dipeptide of Pnk superimposes on the distal Asp171 of the PSP167DXXXD171 motif, while the distal Asp288 of Pnk DD overlies the proximal Asp167 of the PSP167DXXXD171 element. The DXXXD motif was recognized as a signature feature, along with the upstream DXDXT element, of the proteins that were initially felt to comprise the phosphatase superfamily (21Thaller M.C. Schippa S. Rossolini G.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1647-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Aravind A. Galperin M.Y. Koonin E.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 127-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Yet, the structural and mutational data for Pnk and Fcp1 suggest that they belong to a different subgroup of phosphatases within the DXDXT superfamily, which is defined by their DD motifs. The PSP structure shows that the two aspartates of the DXXXD motif comprise part of the divalent cation coordination complex in the active site via direct and water-mediated contacts between the carboxylate oxygens and the metal (24Cho H.S. Wang W. Kim R. Yokota H. Damo S. Kim S.H. Wemmer D.E. Kustu S. Yan D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8525-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 29Wang W. Cho H.S. Kim R.

Thus, we infer that the essential 297DD298 dipeptide of Fcp1 is also concerned with metal binding.In summary, we have defined seven essential hydrophilic amino acids ofS. pombe Fcp1 that are conserved in all known Fcp1 orthologs and likely comprise the phosphatase active site. We identify an essential DD motif that is characteristic of Fcp1 and T4 Pnk. Plausible mechanistic roles are proposed for five of the seven essential side chains of Fcp1, either in nucleophilic attack on Ser-PO4(Asp170), general acid-base catalysis (Asp172), transition state stabilization (Lys280), or metal coordination (Asp297, Asp298). The functions of the other two essential Fcp1 side chains (Arg223 and Asp258) cannot be surmised with confidence, but, by analogy with Pnk, they may be involved in positioning one or more of the other catalytic side chains at the active site via a network of hydrogen-bonding interactions (14,16). Definitive evaluation of the mechanism proposed here will hinge on crystallization of Fcp1.

The CTD undergoes a cycle of extensive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at positions Ser5 and Ser2, which is coordinated with the transcription cycle and is responsive to stress and developmental cues. A general picture of CTD phosphorylation dynamics has emerged in which dephosphorylated pol II is recruited to the preinitiation complex and CTD phosphorylation ensues shortly after the elongation complex is established (1Kobor M.S. Greenblatt J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 261-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of the CTD is apparently remodeled during its transit along the gene, the purpose of which may be to control the ingress and egress of the mRNA processing assemblies that modify the nascent transcript (1Kobor M.S.

Fcp1 orthologs are present in all known eukaryal proteomes, and the enzyme is essential for cell viability in budding and fission yeast (7,10). Fcp1 catalyzes the metal-dependent hydrolysis of phosphoserine from the CTD in the context of the pol II elongation complex or isolated pol II and, in the case of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Fcp1, from synthetic CTD phosphopeptide substrates. Fcp1 also hydrolyzes the nonspecific substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The mechanism of the Fcp1 reaction is not known. We are undertaking via site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical methods to dissect the domain structure of S. pombe Fcp1 and localize the essential constituents of the active site. We initially characterized catalytically active deletion mutants Fcp1(140–723) and Fcp1(1–580) and identified two acidic side chains, Asp170and Asp172, as essential for phosphatase activity (11Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21213-21220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we delineate a minimal phosphatase catalytic domain, Fcp1(156–580). To map the active site, we introduced alanine and conservative mutations at 14 residues of S. pombe Fcp1 that are invariant in Fcp1 orthologs from other eukarya (see Fig. 1). We thereby identified five new residues that are essential for catalysis and likely comprise the phosphatase active site. Our results consolidate the hypothesis that Fcp1 belongs to the DXDXT family of phosphotransferases (9Cho H. Kim T. Mancebo H. Lane W.S. Flores O. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1540-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 11Hausmann S. Shuman S. J. Biol.

A plausible catalytic mechanism for Fcp1 is suggested based on the concordance of mutational data for Fcp1 and the polynucleotide 3′-phosphatase domain of bacteriophage T4 polynucleotide kinase. DISCUSSIONHere we employed site-directed mutagenesis to define a minimal catalytic domain and identify five new essential amino acids of theS. pombe CTD phosphatase Fcp1. As discussed in detail below, our results suggest structural and mechanistic similarities between Fcp1 and the 3′-phosphatase domain of T4 polynucleotide kinase (13Wang L.K. Shuman S. J. Biol.

We have identified a highly conserved residue (Ala-483) in the sixth membrane-spanning segment of rat NKCC1 that when mutated to cysteine renders the transporter sensitive to inhibition by the sulfhydryl reagents 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSEA) and 2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate (MTSET). The mutation of Ala-483 to cysteine (A483C) results in little or no change in the affinities of NKCC1 for substrate ions but produces a 6-fold increase in sensitivity to the inhibitor bumetanide, suggesting a specific modification of the bumetanide binding site. When residues surrounding Ala-483 were mutated to cysteine, only I484C was sensitive to inhibition by MTSEA and MTSET. Surprisingly I484C showed increased transport activity in the presence of low concentrations of mercury (1–10 ॖm), whereas A483C showed inhibition. The inhibition of A483C by MTSEA was unaffected by the presence or absence of sodium and potassium but required the presence of extracellular chloride. Taken together, our results indicate that Ala-483 lies at or near an important functional site of NKCC1 and that the exposure of this site to the extracellular medium is dependent on the conformation of the transporter. Specifically, our results indicate that the cysteine introduced at residue 483 is only available for interaction with MTSEA when chloride is bound to NKCC1 at the extracellular surface.

Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Google Scholar,2Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar). By providing a concentrative chloride entry step in chloride secreting and absorbing epithelia, these transporters play a central role in trans-epithelial salt movements across these tissues (1Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Google Scholar, 2Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar). The NKCCs belong to a small gene family with homologues in vertebrates, crustaceans, insects, worms, plants, and some microorganisms. Nine members of this family have been identified in vertebrates, and of these, seven have been shown to be electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporters (3Delpire E. Mount D.B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 803-843Google Scholar). These include two Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter isoforms (NKCC1 and NKCC2), a Na+-Cl− cotransporter (NCC), and four K+-Cl− cotransporter isoforms (KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, and KCC4). The function of the remaining two vertebrate sequences as well as all of the homologues identified in lower organisms remains to be definitively established. NKCC1, the 舠secretory舡 isoform of the Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporters, is the most extensively studied member of the cation-chloride cotransport family at the molecular level. This transporter is relatively widely expressed in both epithelial and non-epithelial tissues and has been of considerable interest because of its roles in cell volume regulation as well as trans-epithelial chloride secretion (1Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Google Scholar, 2Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Google Scholar). The activity of NKCC1 typically is highly regulated by physiological stimuli that can result in its phosphorylation as well as other as yet uncharacterized modifications (1Haas M. Forbush III, B. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 515-534Google Scholar, 4Tanimura A. Kurihara K. Reshkin S.J. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25252-25258Google Scholar). Hydropathy analyses indicate that all of the vertebrate cation-coupled cotransporters share a common membrane topology consisting of large hydrophilic N and C termini (15–35 and ∼50 kDa, respectively) on either side of a central hydrophobic transmembrane domain (∼50 kDa). Topology studies of NKCC1 (5Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Google Scholar) have established that this hydrophobic domain consists of 12 (presumably α-helical) membrane-spanning segments (MSSs). In a recent series of papers, Forbush and colleagues (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar, 8Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Google Scholar) have shown that it is mainly the central hydrophobic domain of NKCC1 that determines its apparent affinities for sodium, potassium, and chloride as well as for the NKCC-specific inhibitor bumetanide (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar, 8Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Google Scholar). The cytosolic N and C termini have little effect on these properties and are thought to be mainly involved in the regulation of transport activity. In addition, these authors were able to identify a number of specific regions within the central hydrophobic domain that were involved in determining substrate affinities. They did this by taking advantage of the fact that although the shark and human NKCC1s are ∼757 identical, they have quite different affinities for transported ions. By examining the properties of various shark-human chimeras, they were able to establish that sequence differences in MSSs 2, 4, and 7 could account for the differences in ion affinities between species. From appropriate point mutations, they were then able to narrow down the list of candidates to 13 residues (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar). These residues are (in the sequence of rat NKCC1) Ser-311 and Val-312 (in MSS 2 associated with sodium affinity differences); Ala-316 and Met-317 (in MSS 2 associated with potassium affinity differences); Ala-405, Ile-406, Val-408, Val-410, and Leu-412 (in MSS 4 associated with potassium and chloride affinity differences); and Val-522, Ile-525, Ile-527, and Val-529 (in MSS 7 associated with affinity differences of all of the transported ions). The authors (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar) speculate that as few as four of these residues may be responsible for the affinity differences between shark and human NKCC1, two residues in MSS 2 and one each in MSSs 4 and 7. Additional studies to further clarify the roles of these 13 candidate residues have yet to be performed. The simplest interpretation of the above results is that these 13 residues, or some subset of them, are located at or near the ion binding sites of NKCC1. However, note that the approach taken in these experiments necessarily excluded the consideration of residues that are conserved between the shark and human NKCC1s. It is anticipated that many of these residues play important functional and structural roles in NKCC1 (hence their conservation) and that some of them also influence ion binding and affinities. Mutations of these latter amino acids would be expected to affect the properties of both shark and human NKCC1. In contrast to the relatively simple findings described above for transported ions, Isenring et al. (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar) found that the affinity differences for bumetanide between shark and human NKCC1 were associated with sequence differences in MSSs 2–7 as well as in MSS 11 and MSS 12. Moreover, a number of their shark-human chimeras had inhibition constants for bumetanide that were outside the range of both shark and human NKCC1, making these results difficult to interpret. In this study, we continue the effort to identify and characterize important functional residues in NKCC1. To do this, we have made use of the substituted cysteine accessibility method (9Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Google Scholar), which involves replacing potentially interesting residues with cysteine and then assaying their accessibility and properties using cysteine-specific reagents. This method has been widely used to study the functional and structural properties of a number of membrane transporters and channels. Having only limited information that would allow us to select residues for mutation, in our initial studies, we chose amino acids that were predicted to be within the MSSs of NKCC1 but close to the extracellular surface and that could be conservatively mutated to cysteine. In a number of cases, we chose residues at or close to those identified above by Isenring et al. (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar). Somewhat surprisingly, these latter cysteine mutants failed to be affected by the sulfhydryl reagents tested, possibly indicating that these residues were located in relatively compact pockets accessible to substrate ions but otherwise protected from the extracellular solution. However, one of our mutants (A483C) reacted strongly with sulfhydryl reagents applied from the extracellular surface and appeared to be exposed only during certain steps of the transport cycle. The methanethiosulfonate (MTS) derivatives, MTSEA (2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate) and MTSET (2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate), were from Toronto Research Chemicals. MTSEA and MTSET were prepared as 100-fold stock solutions in water on the day of the experiment and were kept on ice and diluted into appropriate media just before use. HEK-293 cells were from Microbix and were grown in EMEM (Biofluids) supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 100 ॖm penicillin, 100 ॖm streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (all from Biofluids). 86Rb (0.5–10 mCi/mg) was from Amersham Biosciences. The wild-type construct used in these studies was the rat NKCC1 inserted into the mammalian expression vector pBK-CMVlac− (Stratagene) prepared as described previously (10Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 3718-3724Google Scholar). The NKCC1 sequence was modified to include an N-terminal histidine tag 2M. Saitoh and R. J.

Mutations in the NKCC1 sequence were made using the Stratagene QuikChange mutagenesis kit used according to the manufacturer's instructions with 57 Me2SO added to all PCR reactions. The following media were used in the flux experiments. 舠Preincubation medium舡 contained 135 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 5 mm glucose. 舠Chloride-free medium舡 had the same cationic composition as the preincubation medium but had all chloride replaced by gluconate. 舠Uptake medium舡 contained 135 mm NaCl, 1 mm RbCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 mm glucose, 0.1 mm ouabain, and ∼0.3 ॖCi/ml 86Rb. 舠Termination medium舡 contained 135 mm potassium gluconate, 7.5 mm NaCl, 15 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm ouabain, and 250 ॖmbumetanide. On 舠day zero,舡 HEK-293 cells growing in 10-cm culture dishes were transfected with the plasmids indicated using Polyfect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. On 舠day one,舡 the solution containing the plasmid was removed and the cells were replated into a 24-well culture dish in fresh culture medium. On 舠day three,舡 the 86Rb flux assay was carried out as described below (variations in the flux protocol, if any, are noted in the figure legends). The procedure for measuring fluxes was modeled after but not identical to the methods used by Isenring et al. (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar, 8Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Google Scholar): A row of four wells was used for each experimental point; three wells were used to measure 86Rb flux (i.e. fluxes were carried out in triplicate); and the fourth well was used to determine the protein/well using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). All of the wells were treated identically with the exception that 86Rb was omitted from the uptake medium in the fourth well. For each row of wells, the culture medium was removed, the wells were washed twice in preincubation medium (in every case, additions to the wells were 0.5 ml), and then incubated in preincubation medium for 10 min at room temperature (20 °C, all steps hereafter were carried out at room temperature). The wells were washed next with chloride-free medium and incubated in chloride-free medium for 1 h. The chloride-free medium was then removed and replaced by chloride-free medium plus 0.1 mm ouabain, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. 86Rb uptake was initiated by replacing this medium with uptake medium. After 7 min of incubation, the uptake medium was removed and the well was washed four times with termination medium. Finally, a 0.5-ml aliquot of 17 Triton X-100 was added to each well, and samples were taken for liquid scintillation counting and protein determination. In control experiments (data not shown), we have verified that 86Rb uptake was linear with time for at least 7 min under the experimental conditions described here. All of the results shown are means ± S.E. for three or more independent experiments. Theoretical fits to the data were carried out by non-linear least squares regression using the program SigmaPlot 2000.p values ≤ 0.05 (Student's t test) were taken to represent statistically significant differences. Our general approach in this project was to choose a number of potentially interesting amino acids in NKCC1 that could be conservatively mutated to cysteine and then to test the sensitivity of these mutants to cysteine-specific reagents. Mutants were initially screened with the highly specific sulfhydryl reagents MTSEA (C3H10NO2S2) and MTSET (C6H16NO2S2). Both of these reagents are positively charged with MTSEA being typically more widely reactive in all likelihood because of its somewhat smaller size (9Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Google Scholar). MTSEA has also been shown to be slightly membrane-permeant, whereas MTSET is membrane-impermeant (11Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.1, neither 86Rb flux into mock-transfected HEK-293 cells (V) nor into those transiently transfected with wild-type rat NKCC1 (WT) is significantly affected by either of these reagents under our test conditions (3 min of incubation with 3 mm MTS reagent) (see Fig. 1 legend for details). As illustrated later in the paper (Fig. 5), these ouabain-insensitive 86Rb fluxes are completely inhibited by the NKCC-specific inhibitor bumetanide withK0.5 ∼1 ॖm, indicating that they are essentially entirely attributed to Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransport. The presence of an endogenous NKCC transporter in the HEK-293 cells (HEK-NKCC) has been well documented in previous studies (12Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Google Scholar). As also seen in Fig. 1, 86Rb fluxes in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type NKCC1 are 3–4 times greater than those observed in mock transfectants, indicating a good level of functional NKCC1 expression under our assay conditions.Figure 5Dose response of the effect of bumetanide on wild-type NKCC1, HEK-NKCC, and A483C.86Rb fluxes were measured in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type NKCC1 (circles), empty pBK-CMVlac− vector (squares), and A483C (triangles) in the presence of the concentrations of bumetanide indicated. In these experiments, bumetanide was present with 86Rb in the uptake medium as well as during the 10-min incubation with chloride-free medium plus 0.1 mm ouabain (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡 for other experimental details). Wild-type NKCC1 and A483C fluxes have been corrected for 86Rb uptake via HEK-NKCC, and all of the fluxes have been normalized to that observed in the absence of bumetanide. The data were fit to a model that assumes a single inhibitory site for bumetanide. The solid line is a fit to the wild-type NKCC1 results (K0.5 = 2.4 ± 0.7 ॖm), and the dashed line is a fit to the A483C data (K0.5 = 0.37 ± 0.02 ॖm). A fit to the HEK-NKCC data (not shown) yieldedK0.5 = 0.43 ± 0.09 ॖm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As already indicated, the amino acids we have chosen for mutation to cysteine (Fig. 1) are thought to be located within the MSSs of NKCC1 close to the extracellular surface (5Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Google Scholar). In most cases, we chose residues at or close to those identified by Isenring et al.(7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar) as being potentially associated with substrate binding sites. Ser-311, Val-312, and Ala-316 are in the second MSS of NKCC1 and are thought to be at or near the sites of interaction of the cotransporter with sodium and potassium, Ala-405 is located in the fourth MSS of NKCC1 at or near a region associated with the interactions of potassium and chloride, and Ala-528 and Ser-530 are located in the seventh MSS close to a region associated with the interactions of all three substrate ions (see Introduction). Finally, Ala-483 is located in the sixth MSS of NKCC1, a region of the protein that is highly conserved, especially between the NKCCs and NCCs (Fig.2). As illustrated in Fig. 1, all of these cysteine mutants are functional when transiently transfected into HEK293 cells, but only A483C is inhibited by MTSEA and MTSET under our experimental conditions. The dependence of the inhibition of A483C on MTSEA and MTSET concentrations is illustrated in Fig. 3,A and B. The analyses of these data yieldK0.5 values for the effects of MTSEA and MTSET of 0.36 ± 0.07 and 1.48 ± 0.37 mm, respectively (see Fig. 3 legend). From Fig. 3A, it can be seen that the inhibitory effect of MTSEA is essentially complete after 3 min of incubation with 3 mm reagent. This was confirmed in time course studies where we found that the t12 for the effect of 3 mm MTSEA was <15s (data not shown, times up to 10 min were studied). After 3 min of incubation with 3 mmMTSEA, we found that the average residual 86Rb flux into A483C-transfected cells is 4.7 ± 0.3(n = 17) nmol/mg protein/min. By comparison, the average 86Rb flux attributed to HEK-NKCC in mock-transfected cells (3.4 ± 0.2 nmol/mg protein/min (n = 25)) is significantly lower. Thus, the reaction with MTSEA (and in all likelihood also with MTSET) (cf. Fig. 3B) does not appear to result in complete inhibition of A483C. These results also indicate that transient transfection of NKCC1 into HEK-293 cells does not suppress endogenous HEK-NKCC activity as has been suggested to occur in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with NKCC1 constructs (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 13Darman R.B. Forbush B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37542-37550Google Scholar). The above experiments demonstrate that the mutation of Ala-483 to cysteine renders NKCC1 sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents applied from the extracellular solution. The fact that reaction with these reagents leads to transport inhibition indicates that the residue being modified is at or near an important functional site of NKCC1. To better understand the significance of the A483C mutation, we next compared the behavior of A483C to that of wild-type NKCC1 and HEK-NKCC. Fig.4 illustrates the sodium, rubidium, and chloride dependence of 86Rb fluxes via these three transporters. In the upper panels, we have plotted (normalized) total fluxes versus substrate concentration, whereas in the lower panels, wild-type NKCC1 and A483C fluxes have been corrected for flux via HEK-NKCC. Overall, the transport characteristics of A483C are very similar to the wild-type transporter except possibly for a marginally lower affinity for chloride (see Fig. 4 legend). In contrast, as illustrated in Fig.5, A483C as well as HEK-NKCC shows a 6-fold higher sensitivity to bumetanide than wild-type NKCC1. The fact that the mutation of Ala-483 to cysteine has little or no effect on the affinities of all three substrate ions suggests that this modification results in only minor perturbations in NKCC1 conformation and function. The larger effect on bumetanide affinity appears to be specific to bumetanide, possibly because of a direct modification of its binding site on NKCC1. Inorganic mercury is also known to react strongly with free sulfhydryl groups. Fig.6 shows the effects of mercury on wild-type NKCC1, HEK-NKCC, and A483C. It is clear that wild-type NKCC1 and HEK-NKCC have a similar sensitivity to mercury withK0.5 ∼25 ॖm (see Fig. 6 legend). However, A483C shows a far greater sensitivity. Approximately, 707 of the 86Rb flux via A483C is inhibited by mercury withK0.5 < 1 ॖm, whereas the remainder appears to have a similar sensitivity to that of wild-type NKCC1 (we have not attempted to fit these data to a two-component model because of the scatter on the points). This behavior is reminiscent of the effects of MTSEA and MTSET documented in Fig. 3 in that the inhibition by mercury at its high affinity site does not result in complete blockade of A483C. Because Ala-483 is located in a highly conserved (Fig.2) and apparently functionally important region of the NKCCs, we wondered whether its accessibility to sulfhydryl reagents might be influenced by substrates or inhibitors of NKCC1. In Fig.7, we illustrate that when A483C-transfected HEK-293 cells are exposed to MTSEA in sodium-free or potassium-free medium or in the presence of 100 ॖmfurosemide, its effect is not significantly different from that observed under control (sodium-, potassium-, and chloride-replete) conditions. However, when exposure to MTSEA is carried out in the absence of chloride, its inhibitory effect is markedly blunted. This result suggests that the reaction of MTSEA with A483C is dependent on transporter conformation and, more specifically, that the conformations of the transporter present in the absence of extracellular chloride are insensitive to MTSEA. A more detailed discussion of the significance of this result is given later in the paper. In Fig.8, we show the effects of 3 mm MTSEA and MTSET on NKCC1 mutants in which nine residues surrounding Ala-483 have been individually changed to cysteine.86Rb uptake into HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with two of these mutants, P487C and A488C, is not significantly different from that seen with mock-transfected cells (cf. Fig. 1), indicating that these mutations do not result in a functional transporter at the plasma membrane. Fluxes via the remaining seven cysteine mutants are 50–1007 of wild-type levels, but only I484C in addition to A483C is inhibited by MTSEA and MTSET. In Fig.9, we examine the sensitivity of these mutants to inorganic mercury. Most of the mutants behave quite similarly to wild-type NKCC1 (Fig. 9, solid line in allpanels); however, I484C (middle panel,squares) shows a dramatic stimulation of 86Rb uptake over the mercury concentration range of 1–10 ॖmfollowed by inhibition at higher mercury concentrations. A similar but blunted effect appears to also occur for S480C (upper panel,triangles) and F486C (lower panel,triangles).Figure 9Dose response of the effect of inorganic mercury on NKCC1 cysteine mutants in MSS 6.86Rb fluxes were measured in HEK-293 cells transiently transfected with various NKCC1 mutants in the presence of the concentrations of mercury (as HgCl2) as indicated.

Bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb fluxes via these mutants were measured in transiently transfected HEK-293 cells. HEK-293 cells have been extensively employed by previous investigators to study a number of facets of NKCC1 function (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar, 8Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34359-34362Google Scholar). These past studies were carried out on stably transfected clonal cell lines. The present experiments demonstrate that comparable 86Rb fluxes can be obtained from transient transfectants, allowing for a significant reduction in time and labor in high throughput-type experiments such as the screening of mutants. In their experiments, Isenring et al. (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen.

Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Google Scholar) have extensively characterized human NKCC1 in this expression system. They found Km values of 15, 1.95, and 31 mmfor the substrates sodium, rubidium, and chloride, respectively, andK0.5 values of 56 ॖm for mercury and 0.28 ॖm for the NKCC-specific inhibitor bumetanide. In the present experiments with wild-type rat NKKC1, we foundKm values of 61, 1.85, and 48 mm for sodium, rubidium, and chloride, respectively, andK0.5 of 29 ॖm for mercury and 2.4 ॖm for bumetanide (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). In their 86Rb flux measurements, Isenring et al. (6Isenring P. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24556-24562Google Scholar, 7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar, 8Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7179-7184Google Scholar) used 5 mm unlabeled rubidium, whereas we have used 1 mm. Because higher rubidium concentrations are expected to increase the affinity of NKCC1 for sodium, chloride, and bumetanide, this may account for at least some of the differences between our results and theirs. In their studies, Isenring et al. (12Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Google Scholar) also found that HEK-NKCC, the endogenous Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter of the HEK-293 cells (a human cell line), had rather different properties from their human NKCC1 clone. More specifically, they foundKm values of 35, 15, and 42 mm for sodium, rubidium, and chloride, respectively, andK0.5 values of 133 ॖm for mercury and 0.08 ॖm for bumetanide. In our hands, the behavior of HEK-NKCC is more similar to that of the rat NKCC1. We foundKm values of 41, 1.47, and 63.6 mm for sodium, rubidium, and chloride, respectively, andK0.5 values of 24 ॖm for mercury and 0.4 ॖm for bumetanide (Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). This difference may be related to the source of HEK-293 cells used in our experiments, but we have not explored this matter further. A number of the residues we have mutated to cysteine in this study (S311, Val-312, Ala-316, Ala-405, Ala-528, and Ser-530) have been previously suggested to be at or near the binding sites for sodium, potassium, or chloride on NKCC1 (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar). Interestingly, none of these mutations rendered NKCC1 sensitive to MTSEA or MTSET under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1). In additional experiments (data not shown), we have confirmed that the sensitivity of these mutants to inorganic mercury is likewise not significantly altered from that of wild-type NKCC1. These results indicate either that the cysteines introduced at these sites are inaccessible to the sulfhydryl reagents we have tested or that the modifications resulting from these reagents have no effect on transport. Although additional experiments are required to distinguish between these possibilities, given the rather convincing evidence that modifications in at least some of these residues can dramatically affect substrate affinities (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar), we would suggest that the former explanation is more likely to be the correct one. If this is the case, it would appear that the NKCC1 ion binding sites may be located in regions that are relatively inaccessible except to substrates, for example, in pockets buried below the protein surface. In contrast to the above mutations, we found that the NKCC1 mutant A483C was inhibited by MTSEA and MTSET (Figs. 1 and 3) and showed a dramatically higher sensitivity to inorganic mercury than wild-type NKCC1 (Fig. 6). Because MTSET is membrane-impermeant, its reaction with A483C must be from the extracellular solution. After 3 min of incubation with 300 ॖm MTSEA, we found that it has achieved ∼507 of its maximal effect, indicating at12 of ∼3 min. However, reaction rates of MTSEA and MTSET with accessible protein cysteines can exceed 104m−1s−1 (11Holmgren M. Liu Y. Xu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Google Scholar, 16Pascual J.M. Karlin A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 717-739Google Scholar, 17Liu Y. Jurman M.E. Yellen G. Neuron. 1996; 16: 859-867Google Scholar) in which case the t12 for reaction with 300 ॖmreagent would be 0.23 s. The much longer t12 we observe with A483C suggests that the reactive cysteine is not directly accessible from the extracellular solution. Consistent with this finding, hydropathy analyses and topology studies (5Gerelsaikhan T. Turner R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40471-40477Google Scholar) indicate that Ala-483 is located within MSS 6 of NKCC1 close to but not at the extracellular surface. This region of the protein is highly conserved among NKCCs and their homologues (Fig. 2), suggesting an important role in transporter structure or function. The relatively conservative mutation of Ala-483 to cysteine results in little or no change in substrate affinities (Fig. 4), but it does produce a 6-fold increase in the affinity of NKCC1 for bumetanide (Fig.5). The fact that this mutation produces a bumetanide-specific effect suggests that it may result in a relatively small change that only affects the bumetanide binding site. In their studies, Isenringet al. (7Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Chang J. Forbush B. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 549-558Google Scholar) found that the residues associated with thedifferences in bumetanide affinity between human and shark NKCC1 were in MSS 2–7 as well as MSS 11 and MSS 12. The present results indicate that MSS 6 is also associated with bumetanide binding. When residues surrounding Ala-483 were mutated to cysteine, only I484C showed a dramatic change in sensitivity to MTS reagents and inorganic mercury (Figs. 8 and 9). Surprisingly, I484C showed increased transport activity in the presence of low concentrations (1–10 ॖm) of mercury (Fig. 9), whereas A483C showed inhibition (Fig. 6). The reason for this dramatic difference in transport behavior remains to be determined, but it is again consistent with the hypothesis that MSS 6 plays an important role in the function of NKCC1. When the residues surrounding Ala-483 are plotted on a helical wheel (Fig. 10), it is clear that Ala-483 and Ile-484 lie on a relatively polar face of a (putative) helix whose opposite side is strongly hydrophobic. Interestingly, Ser-480 whose cysteine mutant also shows some stimulation at low concentrations of mercury (Fig. 9) and Pro-487 whose cysteine mutant shows no function (Fig. 8) also lie on the same face (Ser-480, Ala-483, Ile-484, and Pro-487 are identified by asterisks in Fig. 10). Because little is really known regarding the structure of NKCC1, it is difficult to speculate about the involvement of MSS 6 in helix packing; however, the highly hydrophobic face of MSS 6 on the left side in Fig.10 almost certainly faces the membrane lipid, indicating that MSS 6 lies on the periphery of the intact NKCC1 molecule. Because there are other native cysteines on NKCC1, it is possible in principle that mutating Ala-483 could result in a change in conformation that leads to the exposure of a previously hidden cysteine and that the effects we observe here are because of reactions at that site. In fact, there are only two candidates for this putative cysteine. Of the 12 native cysteines on wild-type rat NKCC1 (18Moore-Hoon M.L. Turner R.J. Eur. J. Morphol. 1998; 36 (suppl.): 137-141Google Scholar), five are thought to be intracellular and therefore inaccessible to MTSET and five are located in a long glycosylated extracellular loop between MSS 7 and MSS 8 and therefore already accessible to extracellular reagents in wild-type NKCC1. The remaining two cysteines are located near the middle of MSS 11 (5). There are several reasons why we feel that it is very unlikely that our results could be the result of the exposure a native cysteine. First, the mutation of Ala-483 to cysteine is a relatively conservative one and is unlikely to result in a major conformational change in the protein. Thus, the reactive cysteine in A483C is much more likely to be Cys-483 than a previously non-reactive native cysteine. Second, the transport properties of A483C are almost identical to those of wild-type NKCC1, again arguing strongly against a major change in conformation. Third, the effects of mercury on A483C and I484C are dramatically different (Figs. 6 and 9). It is very unlikely that these two disparate effects could both be accounted for by the exposure of a previously inaccessible cysteine. The mutant A483C has one other very interesting property. It is insensitive to inhibition by 3 mm MTSEA and MTSET in the absence of extracellular chloride (Fig. 7). This result indicates that the reactivity of the cysteine introduced at position 483 is dependent on transporter conformation. The significance of this observation can be best appreciated by considering a model for the function of NKCC1. Fig. 11 shows the NKCC1 transport cycle proposed by Lytle et al. (19Lytle C. McManus T.J. Haas M. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 43: C299-C309Google Scholar). The binding of substrates is ordered with sodium binding first to the empty transporter on the extracellular side followed by a chloride, potassium, and then a second chloride. NKCC1 is thought to have 舠mirror symmetry,舡 meaning that substrate dissociation on the intracellular side occurs in the same order that the substrates bind on the extracellular side,i.e. sodium dissociates first from the fully loaded transporter followed by chloride, potassium, and chloride (see Fig. 11). Coupling is 舠tight,舡 i.e. only the completely empty and fully loaded transporters are capable of the conformational change that reorients the substrate binding pocket between its outward-facing and inward-facing forms (the transitions between conformations I and X and between V and VI, respectively). During incubation in sodium-, potassium-, and chloride-replete medium, all of the conformations of NKCC1 will be populated so that the inhibition of A483C by MTS reagents (Fig. 3) under these conditions could be attributed to a reaction with any or all of them. In the absence of extracellular chloride, conformations III, IV, and V can still be populated from conformation VI; however, conformations III and V will only be present transiently because chloride will dissociate from them and cannot be replaced. Accordingly, because the reaction with 3 mm MTSEA is rapid (t12 < 15 s, see above) and chloride loss from HEK-293 cells in isotonic chloride-free medium is much slower (t12 ∼40 min; see Ref. 12Isenring P. Jacoby S.C. Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11295-11301Google Scholar), we expect that all of the conformations of NKCC1 other than III and V would be available for reaction with MTSEA when these cells are switched to chloride-free medium. Because MTSEA is in fact without effect under these conditions (Fig. 7), we conclude that only conformations III and V could be sensitive to MTSEA. By similar arguments, conformations III and V would be expected to be available for reaction in extracellular sodium-free and potassium-free conditions, whereas conformations II and IV, respectively, would not. Consistent with our argument that only conformations III and/or V are MTSEA-sensitive, MTSEA is in fact inhibitory in sodium-free and potassium-free media (Fig. 7). Other models of NKCC1 function would obviously lead to appropriately modified conclusions, but in general, our results indicate that the cysteine introduced at site 483 is only available for interaction with MTSEA when NKCC1 is in an externally oriented conformation with chloride bound.

We constructed the corresponding green fluorescent protein fusion proteins and studied their intracellular localization in COS-1 cells. We showed that 28 amino acids in the amino terminus of PPOX contain an independently functioning signal for mitochondrial targeting. The experiments with amino-terminally truncated green fluorescent protein fusion proteins revealed that amino acids 25–477 of PPOX contained an additional mitochondrial targeting signal(s). We constructed a structural model for the interaction between the amino-terminal end of PPOX and the putative mitochondrial receptor protein Tom20. The model suggests that leucine and isoleucine residues Leu-8, Ile-12, and Leu-15 forming an α-helical hydrophobic motif, LXXXIXXL, were crucial for the recognition of the targeting signal. The validity of the model was tested using mutants L8Q, I12T, and L15Q disrupting the hydrophobic surface of the LXXXIXXL helix. The results fromin vitro expression studies and molecular modeling were in accordance supporting the hypothesis that the recognition of the mitochondrial targeting signal is dependent on hydrophobic interactions between the targeting signal and the mitochondrial receptor.

PPOX catalyzes the six-electron oxidation of protoporphyrinogen IX to the planar, fully conjugated macrocycle protoporphyrin IX in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion and requires oxygen for its activity (2Dailey H.A.

Partial deficiency of PPOX causes a disease, variegate porphyria (VP, OMIMTM accession number 176200), that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait displaying incomplete penetrance (3Kappas A.

The biochemical abnormalities found in VP patients include overproduction and increased excretion of porphyrins and porphyrin precursors. VP manifests clinically with photosensitivity and acute attacks, which include various neuropsychiatric symptoms (4Day R.S. Semin. Dermatol. 1986; 5: 138-154Google Scholar, 5Mustajoki P. Q. J.

Alternatively post-translational acylation may facilitate transient or permanent association of PPOX with the membrane (8Arnould S. Takahashi M. Camadro J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The majority of proteins imported to mitochondria contain a signal sequence of 20–60 amino acids in their amino terminus that directs them into mitochondria (9Pfanner N. Curr.

The mitochondrial targeting signals of different polypeptides show no amino acid sequence identity, but they have characteristic physicochemical properties. They are enriched in positively charged, hydroxylated, and hydrophobic residues; have no acidic residues; and usually are able to form an amphiphilic secondary structure (10von Heijne G.

In this communication we have investigated the mitochondrial transport of seven PPOX mutants by expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins in COS-1 cells and studying their intracellular localization. The mitochondrial targeting signal in the amino terminus of PPOX was characterized, and a model for the interaction between the targeting signal and the mitochondrial receptor Tom20 was proposed. Seven mutations selected for this study were previously identified from Finnish VP patients and expressed in Escherichia coli and COS-1 cells (Table I) (21Kauppinen R.

The human PPOX-pUC18 (kindly provided by Prof. S. Taketani, Kyoto Institute of Technology, Kyoto, Japan) was digested with EcoRI and XbaI, and the fragment including exons 1–7 was ligated as a cassette to the pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP vector with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Exons 7–13 were amplified using PPOX-pUC18 as a template and primers 1 and 2, which abolished the stop codon (Table II). The PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and ligated as a cassette into PPOX-(ex1–7)-pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP to obtain a full-length PPOX-GFP. The constructs for the mutations I12T, R152C, and 470A→C were made by digesting the mutated PPOX-pUC18 constructs (21Kauppinen R. Timonen K. von und zu Fraunberg M. Laitinen E. Ahola H. Tenhunen R.

COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal heat-inactivated bovine serum, penicillin (10,000 units/ml, Invitrogen), and streptomycin (10,000 units/ml). For transfection, the cells were seeded on a 3-cm six-well plate at 400,000 cells/well and grown overnight. The 50–70% confluent cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of the PPOX-GFP or mutated constructs by lipofection using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The pcDNA3.1/CT-GFP vector alone was used as a negative control in all experiments. For GFP fluorescence studies, COS-1 cells were trypsinized and replated on glass coverslips 24 h after transfection. For mitochondrial staining, 40 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added to medium for 45 min at 48 h post-transfection. The cells were fixed immediately with 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After fixation, the cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and mounted in Mowiol 4-88 mounting medium (Calbiochem). The cells were observed on a Leica TCS confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems GmBH, Heidelberg, Germany). Fluorescence of GFP was excited using a 488 nm argon/krypton laser, and emitted fluorescence was detected with a 500–530 nm band pass filter. For MitoTracker Red, a 543 nm helium-neon laser was used for excitation, and fluorescence was detected with a 565–699 nm band pass filter. For three-dimensional imaging, a stack of 30 images with 0.20-μm distance was taken, and the three-dimensional picture was constructed using Leica Confocal Software 2.00. Analysis of the amino-terminal sequence of PPOX using the Swiss-Model and MolMol programs predicts that an 11-residue polypeptide, PPOX-(11–21), forms an α-helical structure where hydrophobic residues are clustered together (Fig. 1) (Refs. 23Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar and 24Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. Model. 1996; 14: 52-55Google Scholar; www.expasy.org/swissmod/SWISS-MODEL.html, compared with monoamine oxidase-B structure (Protein Data Bank entry 1GOS) with 42.7% amino acid identity as a template). The model of PPOX-(6–23) bound to Tom20 was constructed in the Bodil Modeling Environment (www.abo.fi/fak/mnf/bkf/research/johnson/bodil.html) using the coordinates of the NMR structure of rat Tom20 in a complex with an 11-residue recognition peptide from rat aldehyde dehydrogenase, pALDH-(12–22), as a template (Protein Data Bank entry 1OM2). pALDH-(12–22) contains a hydrophobic LXXLL motif in an α-helical conformation where leucines are in contact with a hydrophobic groove on the surface of Tom20 (Fig.2B) (25Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Rat Tom20 shows a 98% amino acid identity with human Tom20, and the amino acids in the vicinity of the hydrophobic groove are fully conserved (25Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). When the program Malign (26Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 716-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in Bodil was used in the comparison of PPOX-(1–23) and pALDH-(12–22), the sequence GPRLSRLLSYA in pALDH-(12–22) aligns with the GGGISGLAASY part of the PPOX-(1–23) sequence at best. The most important determinant of this comparison was alignment of the ISGLA motif in PPOX-(1–23) with the LSRLL motif in pALDH-(12–22). ISGLA is the only part in PPOX-(1–23) that has a hydrophobic surface in the α-helical conformation similar to the α-helical LSRLL motif in pALDH-(12–22), which is needed for the interaction with Tom20 (25Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The model of the 18-residue PPOX-(6–23) was constructed using Sybyl 6.8 (Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) (Fig. 2A). The α-helical model of PPOX-(6–23) was superimposed on the coordinates of pALDH-(12–22) in a complex with Tom20 applying a constraint that the LXXLL motif in pALDH-(12–22) must be aligned with the IXXLA motif in PPOX-(6–23). Sterical clashes were removed manually by modifying the amino acid side chains using Bodil Modeling Environment. The α-helical structure of pALDH-(12–22) bound to Tom20 ends amino-terminally to Pro-13, whereas in our model of PPOX-(6–23) (VVLGGGISGLAASYHLSR) the α-helix (underlined) continues an additional turn to facilitate the contact of Leu-8 with Tom20 (Fig. 2C). Together the residues 8–15 (LXXXIXXL) of PPOX-(6–23) form a continuous hydrophobic surface on one face of the α-helix (Fig.2A). The validity of the model was tested using mutants Leu-8, Ile-12, and Leu-15 that disrupt the hydrophobic face of the LXXXIXXL helix. We investigated the transport of the wild type and seven PPOX mutants to mitochondria by constructing GFP fusion proteins in which GFP was located at the carboxyl-terminal end of PPOX (Fig.3). PPOX-GFP and GFP construct alone were used as controls in all experiments. COS-1 cells were transfected with the constructs, and GFP fluorescence was analyzed with confocal laser scanning microscopy to monitor subcellular localization of the polypeptides. The cells expressing the wild type PPOX-GFP demonstrated a typical filamentous mitochondrial pattern (27Horie C. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1615-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 28Rizzutto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), which was clearly distinguishable from the cytosolic pattern of GFP construct alone (Fig.3, A and B). The localization was confirmed by counterstaining with a mitochondrion-specific dye (Fig. 3C). A pattern indistinguishable from PPOX-GFP was observed for each of the seven mutants (Fig. 3D) indicating that transport to mitochondria was not impaired in any of them. Since the truncated PPOX fusion protein corresponding to the mutation 78insC in exon 2 (PPOX-(1–28)-GFP) contained only the first 28 residues of PPOX, these amino acids must contain an independently functioning mitochondrial targeting signal. After localization of the mitochondrial targeting signal in the amino terminus of PPOX, two additional constructs were created where this region was removed either totally (PPOX-(Δ5–23)-GFP) or partially (PPOX-(Δ5–11)-GFP) (Fig.4A). The experiments using fluorescence confocal microscopy demonstrated that these fusion proteins were associated with the mitochondria indicating that the amino acids 25–477 of PPOX must contain an additional mitochondrial targeting signal(s). To make a hypothesis for the molecular recognition of the amino-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal of PPOX, we constructed an α-helical model of PPOX-(6–23) and a model of the interaction between PPOX-(6–23) and the mitochondrial import receptor Tom20. The model places the LXXXIXXL (Leu-8, Ile-12, and Leu-15) motif of PPOX-(6–23) in contact with the hydrophobic groove on the Tom20 surface (Fig. 2B). We tested our structural model by mutating the PPOX-(6–23) residues Ile-12 into threonine and residues Leu-8 and Leu-15 into glutamine. These amino acid substitutions disrupt the hydrophobic face of the LXXXIXXL helix model (Fig. 4C), which should affect the capability of interaction with Tom20. Each mutation caused a disruption of PPOX transport into mitochondria (Fig. 4,B and C) confirming that each of these residues was essential for the PPOX targeting. In the amino terminus of PPOX, the LXXXIXXL motif including residues Leu-8, Ile-12, and Leu-15 appeared to be crucial for the putative interaction between PPOX and Tom20. In this communication, we have investigated the signal sequence for the mitochondrial transport of the wild type PPOX and mutants by constructing the corresponding GFP fusion proteins. The intracellular localization of the seven mutants corresponding to clinically manifest VP showed no impairment of mitochondrial targeting. Because of the naturally occurring mutation 78insC, we were able to show that the first 28 amino acids in the amino terminus of PPOX contained sufficient information for transporting a reporter protein into mitochondria. The predicted secondary structure of the PPOX amino terminus consists of a βαβ motif (17Nishimura K. Taketani S. Inokuchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8076-8080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) where the α-helix is a common structure found in mitochondrial targeting signals. Our structural model of interaction between the amino terminus of PPOX and Tom20 and the experiments with amino-terminally mutated fusion proteins indicated that the critical residues for the recognition of the PPOX targeting signal include leucine and isoleucine residues that form a hydrophobic motif, LXXXIXXL. Our findings support the hypothesis that recognition of the mitochondrial targeting signal is dependent on hydrophobic interactions with the mitochondrial receptor. The NMR structure of rat Tom20 in a complex with the mitochondrial presequence peptide revealed that an amphiphilic α-helical structure of the presequences was important for binding to the receptor (25Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Subsequent mutagenesis studies showed that the hydrophobic residues were essential for binding to Tom20, while the hydrophilic residues, including two positively charged arginines in the presequence, were dispensable (25Abe Y. Shodai T. Muto T. Mihara K. Torii H. Nishikawa S. Endo T. Kohda D. Cell. 2000; 100: 551-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Consistently, in the amino-terminal recognition sequence of PPOX, replacing a single hydrophobic leucine or isoleucine with a hydrophilic residue of the same size could prevent the mitochondrial transport. The amino terminus of PPOX contains only three positively charged residues, which is less than in most presequences (29Tzschoppe K. Kohlwein S.D. Rodel G. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that the positively charged residues could be involved in subsequent ionic interactions between the targeting signal and Tom22, which is also known to bind amino-terminal recognition sequences, especially their carboxyl-terminal parts, in a salt-sensitive manner (13Brix J. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20730-20735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 30Brix J. Rüdiger S. Bukau B. Scheider-Mergener J. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16522-16530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In the case of PPOX, two positively charged residues, Arg-23 and Lys-29, which are located in the carboxyl-terminal part of the recognition sequence, could facilitate this interaction. Surprisingly PPOX derivatives, where the amino-terminal targeting signal was removed either totally or partially, were still located in the mitochondria. This implies that the residual part of PPOX must contain an additional mitochondrial targeting signal(s) (29Tzschoppe K. Kohlwein S.D. Rodel G. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). PPOX is a further example of mitochondrial proteins whose import is not strictly dependent on the presence of an amino-terminal presequence (29Tzschoppe K. Kohlwein S.D. Rodel G. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 31Michaelis U. Korte A. Rodel G. Mol. Gen.

Nett J.H. Trumpower B.L. FEBS Lett. 1999; 449: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Secondary structure prediction of PPOX reveals several internal leucine-rich α-helical segments with a net positive charge. Such segments can putatively form hairpin-like structures that mimic a typical amphiphilic presequence and function as an internal mitochondrial targeting sequence (34Folsch H. Gaume B. Brunner M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6508-6515Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Without knowledge of the tertiary structure of PPOX it is, however, difficult to predict which of these segments could be accessible to the receptor and serve as an effective targeting signal. Since the naturally occurring mutation I12T resides in the conserved amino terminus of PPOX, the mutation could interfere with mitochondrial transport and modify the phenotype of the disease. Our study shows that although the I12T substitution is able to disrupt the mitochondrial transport of the truncated PPOX, the corresponding full-length PPOX is transported into mitochondria. In vitro expression studies of the I12T substitution have shown a dramatic loss of the enzyme activity both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (21Kauppinen R. Timonen K. von und zu Fraunberg M.

A homozygous patient with the I12T substitution has been identified with around 10% residual PPOX activity measured from his lymphocytes (21Kauppinen R. Timonen K. von und zu Fraunberg M. Laitinen E.

It would be intriguing to hypothesize that in this patient the secondary mitochondrial targeting signal(s) could serve as a backup system that directs the polypeptide into mitochondria if the primary signal fails. This transport may be, however, less specific and efficient (35Zara V. Palmieri F. Mahlke K. Pfanner N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12077-12081Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and lead to non-optimal submitochondrial compartmentalization. This could disrupt the final steps of the heme biosynthesis in the inner mitochondrial membrane especially if the substrate channeling between the last three enzymes of the pathway, namely coproporphyrinogen oxidase, PPOX, and ferrochelatase, occurs through an enzyme complex as suggested by Ferreira et al. (7Ferreira G.C. Andrew T.L. Karr S.W. Dailey H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3835-3839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the enzyme complex would explain the low ferrochelatase activity (10% and 30–40% of normal) measured from the homozygous and heterozygous patients' erythrocytes, respectively.

As it is well known that oxidative stress plays the role of apoptosis (15Mattson M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 120-129Google Scholar), the oxidative stress and apoptosis may be also tightly linked in Alzheimer's disease. In fact, FAD-related mutant PS1 is also involved in apoptosis (13Guo Q.

In this study, we try to elucidate the possibility that sel-12 is involved in oxidative stress and apoptosis in C. elegans. In attempting to clarify the relationship between sel-12 and cell death, we used the C. elegans sel-12 and mev-1 mutants in this study. The mev-1(kn1) mutant has a defect in the cytochrome b large subunit in complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain that shows hypersensitivity to oxygen and paraquat (20Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Google Scholar). Senoo-Matsuda et al. (21Senoo-Matsuda N. Yasuda K. Tsuda M. Ohkubo T. Yoshimura S. Nakazawa H. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41553-41558Google Scholar) have reported that the generation of reactive oxygen species is elevated inmev-1 mutants. Furthermore, increased numbers of apoptosis were observed in mev-1(kn1) embryos. 2N. Senoo-Matsuda, unpublished data. For these reasons, we chose to investigate sel-12mev-1 double mutants in this study. The sel-12 mutants examined in this study weresel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538) andsel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538).ar131 carries a missense mutation (C60S), andar171 carries a nonsense mutation (W225stop), which produces a truncated SEL-12 protein. Genetically,sel-12(ar171) represents a null allele (17Levitan D. Greenwald I. Nature. 1995; 377: 351-354Google Scholar). The marker mutant unc-1(e538) was also examined as a control. Moreover, we demonstrate in this study that intracellular calcium regulation is an important factor for sel-12-induced apoptosis by the use of dantrolene to block calcium release from the ER. The C. elegans alleles used were as follows: Bristol N2 wild-type strain,unc-1(e538);sel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538);sel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538);ced-3(n1286);ced-3(n1286)sel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538);ced-4(n1894);ced-4(n1894)sel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538);mev-1(kn1);mev-1(kn1)lon-1(e185); andsel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538)mev-1(kn1)lon-1(e185). The N2 wild-type strain and unc-1(e538),ced-3(n1286), andced-4(n1894) mutant strains used in this work were obtained from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC, St. Paul, MN), which is funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research Resources (NCRR, Bethesda, MD). General standard methods were used for the strain maintenance and culturing of C. elegans (22Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 71-94Google Scholar). In particular, animals were grown at 20 °C on NGM agar plates seeded with live bacteria (Escherichia coli strain OP50) as food source. Statistical analysis was done by unpaired Student's t test with the exception of a comparison analysis of apoptotic cells in sel-12 mutants, which was done by one-way factorial analysis of variance. Age-synchronous hermaphrodites after maturation were prepared by the alkaline hypochlorite method (23Sulston J.E. Brenner S. Genetics. 1974; 77: 95-104Google Scholar). 2-day-old synchronized animals were placed on NG agar plates with OP50 and 40 ॖm 5-fluorodeoxyuridine, which was used to block progeny development (24Hosono R. Exp. Gerontol. 1978; 13: 369-374Google Scholar). Seven days after hatching, normally developed animals were transferred to NG agar plates containing 5 mm paraquat in addition to 5-fluorodeoxyuridine and OP50. Animals were grown at 20 °C and subsequently followed for survival. On the fifth day after exposure to paraquat, the number of surviving animals was counted. The survival rate of 60 animals of each strain was followed for each of the four independent trials. Age-synchronous animals were grown in liquid culture (S medium, 0.0017 cholesterol, and Escherichia coli strain NA22). Two days after eggs hatched, hydrogen peroxide was added at several concentrations. After a 2-h exposure, the numbers of animals surviving was counted. The survival rate of 100 animals of each strain was followed for each of the four independent trials. Embryonic development was followed microscopically by using Nomarski optics, and apoptotic cells in the comma embryonic stage were counted. Embryos were collected by the alkaline hypochlorite method. The number of cell corpses was counted in 70 embryos for each of the three independent trials. Synchronized animals were grown on NG agar plates with 10 mm dantrolene. On the third day after hatching, embryos were collected by the alkaline hypochlorite method. Cell death in embryos was examined as described above. To investigate the relationship between oxidative stress and sel-12, we examined the survival rate ofsel-12 mutants under oxidative stress. The toxicity of paraquat and hydrogen peroxide is exerted by their capacity to generate superoxide anions and hydroxy radicals (25Bagley A.C. Krall J. Lynch R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3189-3193Google Scholar, 26Sohal R.S. Exp. Gerontol. 1988; 23: 211-216Google Scholar), which expose animals to oxidative stress. We treated animals with 5-fluorodeoxyuridine to prevent the nematodes from dying from bags of worms (thesel-12 mutants have Egl phenotype and die from hatches of eggs in their bodies without using 5-fluorodeoxyuridine). The survival rate is given in Fig. 1,A and B. Without paraquat,sel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538) showed a similar survival curve when compared with the control strainunc-1(e538) (Fig. 1A). In contrast,sel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538) showed an increased survival rate in the presence of 5 mmparaquat, and its survival rate at the fifth day after exposure to paraquat was significantly elevated compared with that ofunc-1(e538) (Fig. 1, B andC), whereas the survival rate ofsel-12(ar131) showed no significant change from that of unc-1(e538) (Fig. 1, A–C). Treatment with 10 mm paraquat also causedsel-12(ar171) to show a tendency for higher resistance, although the difference was not statistically significant (data not shown). Similarly,sel-12(ar171)unc-1(e538) also showed elevated resistance to hydrogen peroxide compared with that of unc-1(e538) (Fig. 1D). We constructed sel-12mev-1(kn1) double mutants to clarify the role of sel-12 in inducing apoptosis under endogenous oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. The number of apoptosis in embryos of C. elegans is easily identified with Nomarski optics (27Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Google Scholar, 28Driscoll M. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 46: 323-353Google Scholar). The nucleus of the apoptotic cell becomes refractile resembling a flat button (Fig.2A). The increased numbers of apoptosis were observed in mev-1(kn1) embryos (Fig. 2B). The number of apoptosis insel-12(ar171)mev-1(kn1) embryos was remarkably decreased, which means thatsel-12(ar171) prevents-mev-1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2B). The number of apoptosis insel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538) was significantly increased as compared with that inunc-1(e538) (Fig.3, A and B). The number of apoptosis in unc-1(e538), examined as a control in this study, was approximately the same as that in wild-type N2 (Fig.3B). We next constructedced-3(n1286)sel-12(ar131) andced-4(n1894)sel-12(ar131) mutants to clarify the mechanism ofsel-12(ar131)-induced cell death. Theced-3 product is homologous to the mammalian interleukin-1ॆ-converting enzyme, which is essential for the execution of programmed cell death. The ced-4 product is a homologue of Apaf-1 and activates ced-3. Either of theced-3 and ced-4 mutations eliminates programmed cell death (27Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1986; 44: 817-829Google Scholar, 29Yuan J. Horvitz H.R. Development. 1992; 116: 309-320Google Scholar, 30Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1993; 75: 641-652Google Scholar). The examination ofced-3(n1286)sel-12(ar131) andced-4(n1894)sel-12(ar131) embryos demonstrated that ced-3(n1286) andced-4(n1894) inhibitedsel-12(ar131)-induced apoptosis completely (Fig. 3, B and C), which means thatsel-12(ar131)-induced apoptosis is dependent onced-3 and ced-4 activity. Previous studies have indicated that perturbed Ca2+ release from the ER is a critical factor for FAD-related PS1-induced apoptosis (13Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 379-383Google Scholar, 31Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat.

Brownawell A.M. Cheng I. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14440-14445Google Scholar). Thus, we treatedsel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538) with dantrolene, which specifically inhibits Ca2+ release from the ER stores. In embryos of dantrolene-treatedsel-12(ar131)unc-1(e538), apoptosis was significantly decreased (Fig.4), which suggests that, by abnormal regulation of calcium release from the ER,sel-12(ar131) predisposes embryo cells to apoptosis. This study demonstrated the role ofsel-12, a PS1 homologue of C. elegans, in apoptosis depending on oxidative stress from mitochondrial dysfunction. The sel-12(ar171) mutant, which genetically represents a null allele, confers increased resistance to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. To investigate the role of sel-12 in apoptotic activities under oxidative stress from mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis in sel-12mev-1 mutant embryos was examined. The mev-1 gene encodes succinate dehydrogenase cytochrome b large subunit (Cyt-1), which is a component of complex II of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (34Ishii N. Takahashi K. Tomita S. Keino T. Honda S. Yoshino K. Suzuki K. Mutat. Res. 1990; 237: 165-171Google Scholar). This mutation elevated the generation of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria (21Senoo-Matsuda N. Yasuda K. Tsuda M. Ohkubo T. Yoshimura S. Nakazawa H. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41553-41558Google Scholar) and increased the number of apoptosis as compared with wild-type N2 embryos.2 Thesel-12(ar171)mev-1(kn1) mutant showed a decreased number of apoptosis as compared withmev-1(kn1), which means thatsel-12(ar171) prevents mev-1-induced apoptosis. This is consistent with our findings thatsel-12(ar171) is resistant to such oxidative stress agents as exogenous paraquat or hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, in another allele mutant,sel-12(ar131) significantly increased the number of apoptosis as compared with that in wild type. Because the supernumerary apoptotic cells were suppressed inced-3(n1286)sel-12(ar131) andced-4(n1894)sel-12(ar131) embryos, this mean that the sel-12(ar131)-induced apoptosis was ced-3- andced-4-dependent. sel-12(ar131) happens to have a conserved point mutation of PS1 C92S, which was reported by an Italian FAD family. 3Terreni, L., Valeria, C., Calella, A., Gavazzi, A., Alberoni, M., Grimaldi, L. M., Mariani, C., and Forloni, G. (2000)Case Report of the 7th International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, Washington, D.C., July 9–13, 2000, unpublished data. Hence, it is expected that sel-12(ar131) has properties in common with the PS1 C92S mutation and with another FAD-linked mutant PS1. The PS1 C92S mutation also increased Aॆ42 production as did the other FAD-related PS1 mutations (35Lewis P.A. Perez-Tur J. Golde T.E. Hardy J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 277: 261-263Google Scholar). Increased Aॆ42 production and induction of apoptosis by the FAD-related mutant PS are considered to be the result of a gain of function property (10Duff K. Eckman C. Zehr C. Yu X. Prada C.M. Perez-tur J. Hutton M. Buee L. Harigaya Y. Yager D. Morgan D. Gordon M.N. Holcomb L. Refolo L. Zenk B. Hardy J. Younkin S.

Accordingly, it is quite likely that sel-12(ar131) has a gain of proapoptotic function similar to that of the FAD-related mutant PS. Some studies have demonstrated that FAD-related mutant PS may sensitize neurons to apoptosis by perturbing intracellular calcium homeostasis (13Guo Q. Furukawa K. Sopher B.L. Pham D.G. Xie J. Robinson N. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Neuroreport. 1996; 8: 379-383Google Scholar, 31Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat.

Brownawell A.M. Cheng I. Tanzi R.E. Kim T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14440-14445Google Scholar). We found that dantrolene treatment suppressedsel-12(ar131)-induced apoptosis, which means that by abnormal regulation of calcium release from the ER,sel-12(ar131) predisposes embryo cells to apoptosis. Our study with sel-12(ar171), which represents a null allele, indicated that sel-12 might itself induce apoptosis under oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, whereassel-12(ar131), which is thought to have a gain of function property, induced apoptosis through abnormal calcium release from the ER. The defective vulva phenotype of sel-12 mutants is rescued by human PS1 (19Levitan D. Doyle T.G. Brousseau D. Lee M.K. Thinakaran G. Slunt H.H. Sisodia S.S. Greenwald I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14940-14944Google Scholar), which suggests that the basic function is conserved between sel-12 and PS1. Therefore, PS1 might also be similarly involved in inducing cell death under oxidative stress or mitochondrial function. The findings of our study onsel-12-induced apoptosis related with oxidative stress would help to further the understanding of the cell death mechanism in Alzheimer's disease. We thank Dr. I. Greenwald for providingsel-12 mutants."

To investigate the selectivity in dimer formation by ligands, we have applied the phage display approach to obtain ligands with modified C-terminal residues that discriminate between ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 as dimerization partners. We used the epidermal growth factor/transforming growth factor α chimera T1E as the template molecule because it binds to ErbB-3 homodimers with low affinity and to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers with high affinity. Many phage variants were selected with enhanced binding affinity for ErbB-3 homodimers, indicating that C-terminal residues contribute to the interaction with ErbB-3. These variants were also potent ligands for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers despite negative selection for such heterodimers. In contrast, phage variants positively selected for binding to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers but negatively selected for binding to ErbB-3 homodimers can be considered as 舠second best舡 ErbB-3 binders, which require ErbB-2 heterodimerization for stable complex formation. Our findings imply that epidermal growth factor-like ligands bind ErbB-3 through a multi-domain interaction involving at least both linear endings of the ligand. Apparently the ErbB-3 affinity of a ligand determines whether it can form only ErbB-2/ErbB-3 complexes or also ErbB-3 homodimers. Because no separate binding domain for ErbB-2 could be identified, our data support a model in which ErbB heterodimerization occurs through a receptor-mediated mechanism and not through bivalent ligands.

In contrast, phage variants positively selected for binding to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers but negatively selected for binding to ErbB-3 homodimers can be considered as 舠second best舡 ErbB-3 binders, which require ErbB-2 heterodimerization for stable complex formation. Our findings imply that epidermal growth factor-like ligands bind ErbB-3 through a multi-domain interaction involving at least both linear endings of the ligand. Apparently the ErbB-3 affinity of a ligand determines whether it can form only ErbB-2/ErbB-3 complexes or also ErbB-3 homodimers. Because no separate binding domain for ErbB-2 could be identified, our data support a model in which ErbB heterodimerization occurs through a receptor-mediated mechanism and not through bivalent ligands. epidermal growth factor neuregulin transforming growth factor dimeric form of ErbB extracellular domains fused to the constant region of immunoglobulin G 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate-buffered saline titrating units The recent determination of the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of ErbB-1 in complex with its ligands epidermal growth factor (EGF)1 or transforming growth factor α (TGF-α) has provided evidence for the formation of homodimeric ErbB-1 complexes through a receptor-mediated dimerization mechanism (1Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W. Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Google Scholar, 2Ogiso H. Ishitani R. Nureki O. Fukai S. Yamanaka M. Kim J.H. Saito K. Sakamoto A. Inoue M. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Cell. 2002; 110: 775-787Google Scholar). Ligand binding to both domains I and III of the extracellular domain of the receptor involves the transition of ErbB-1 from a 舠closed舡 to an 舠open舡 state, which then permits dimerization with another liganded ErbB-1 through interaction of domain II residues within these receptors. Most likely this mechanism can serve as a paradigm for homodimerization of other liganded ErbB receptors, such as ErbB-3 and ErbB-4. However, it is well established that EGF-like growth factors preferentially signal through heterodimers of their cognate receptor with the orphan ErbB-2. The mechanism by which EGF-like growth factors bind their receptors in heterodimeric receptor complexes remains an open question. Dimerization of ligand-bound receptor tyrosine kinases is a mechanism that is thought to activate the intrinsic kinase domain followed by transphosphorylation and subsequent docking of cellular signal transducing proteins. As a consequence, ligand binding serves as a potential site for regulation of cell proliferation in diseases where ErbB receptors are overexpressed, as has been observed for ErbB-1 and ErbB-2 in multiple human cancers (3Yarden Y. Sliwkowski M.X. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 127-137Google Scholar). ErbB-2 has no known ligand, but by decelerating the ligand dissociation rate, it serves as a preferred dimerization partner for all other ErbB members (4Riese II, D.J. Stern D.F. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 41-48Google Scholar, 5Karunagaran D. Tzahar E. Beerli R.R. Chen X. Graus-Porta D. Ratzkin B.J. Seger R. Hynes N.E. Yarden Y.

Heterodimer formation with ErbB-2 is especially important in the case of the ErbB-3, which together with ErbB-4 forms the natural receptor for the different neuregulins (NRGs). ErbB-3 contains a defective kinase and, hence, ErbB-3 homodimers are biologically inactive (7Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EGF-like growth factors share a structurally conserved EGF motif, characterized by three disulfide-bonded loops (the A-, B-, and C-loop), in addition to a linear N-terminal and C-terminal region. Structural and mutational analyses have shown that residues in the A-loop, C-loop, and C-terminal linear region of EGF and TGF-α primarily bind to domain III of ErbB-1 followed by an interaction of residues in their B-loop with domain I of the receptor (1Garrett T.P. McKern N.M. Lou M. Elleman T.C. Adams T.E. Lovrecz G.O. Zhu H.J. Walker F. Frenkel M.J. Hoyne P.A. Jorissen R.N. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Ward C.W. Cell. 2002; 110: 763-773Google Scholar, 2Ogiso H.

By contrast, NRG-1ॆ has been shown to bind with high affinity to a proteolytic fragment of ErbB-3 containing only domain I (17Singer E. Landgraf R. Horan T. Slamon D. Eisenberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44266-44274Google Scholar). Moreover, NRG binding to ErbB-1/ErbB-4 chimeras requires the presence of domain I of the latter receptor, suggesting that ligand binding to NRG receptors primarily involves interaction with domain I of the receptor (18Kim J.H. Saito K. Yokoyama S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2323-2329Google Scholar). Alanine scanning of NRG-1ॆ revealed that hydrophobic and charged residues in the linear N-terminal region and the B-loop, which form a surface patch on one site of the triple ॆ-sheet, are the major determinants in ErbB-3 binding (19Jacobsen N.E. Abadi N. Sliwkowski M.X. Reilly D. Skelton N.J. Fairbrother W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3402-3417Google Scholar, 20Jones J.T. Ballinger M.D. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11667-11674Google Scholar). On the other hand, residues in the C-terminal region of NRG also may play a role in receptor binding, because the natural α and ॆ isoforms of NRG-1 and NRG-2, which only vary in sequences C-terminal of the fifth cysteine, strongly differ in their ability to bind and activate distinct ErbB combinations (21Pinkas-Kramarski R. Shelly M. Glathe S. Ratzkin B.J. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19029-19032Google Scholar, 22Crovello C.S. Lai C. Cantley L.C. Carraway III, K.L. J. Biol.

Exchange studies between NRG-1α and NRG-1ॆ show that particularly the linear C-terminal region determines the binding properties and mitogenic potential of these isoforms (25Whoriskey J.S. Pekar S.K. Elliott G.S. Hara S. Liu N. Lenz D.M. Zamborelli T. Mayer J.P. Tarpley J.E. Lacey D.L. Ratzkin B. Yoshinaga S.K. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 307-321Google Scholar). Therefore, it has been proposed that NRGs may have a bivalent character and interact with both ErbB-3 and ErbB-2 through separate binding sites (26Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of residues in the linear C-terminal region of EGF-like ligands for selective dimer formation, we applied the phage display technique to select ligands that discriminate between ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 as dimerization partners in ErbB-3 complexes. In earlier work we and others showed that EGF chimeras in which the linear N terminus was replaced by either NRG (biregulin) or TGF-α (T1E) residues gained high binding affinity to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers, whereas they bound only weakly to ErbB-3 alone (27Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H. Rosnack K.J. Moyer J.D. Andrews G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9585-9589Google Scholar, 28Stortelers C. Lenferink A.E. van de Poll M.L. Gadellaa M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Google Scholar). Unlike NRG-1ॆ, both T1E and biregulin seem dependent on subsequent binding of ErbB-2 to stabilize their low affinity interaction with ErbB-3. In a previous study we could attribute the weak ErbB-3 interaction of the chimera T1E in part to the presence of sub-optimal sequences in the linear N terminus. Based on a phage display approach we enhanced the binding affinity for ErbB-3 relative to T1E by substitution of only two residues in EGF (D2W and S3 V/R) (29Stortelers C. Souriau C. van Liempt E. van de Poll M.L. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8732-8741Google Scholar). In the present study we have used the same approach to subject five residues in the linear C-terminal region of T1E for randomization and selection for altered receptor selectivity and affinity. The targeted residues in T1E correspond to the positions in the NRG isoforms that have been implicated in the differential activation of ErbB dimers. Here we show that T1E can be strongly optimized for binding to ErbB-3 by the current phage display approach, indicating that residues in the linear C-terminal tail contribute to the ability of ligands to bind ErbB-3 homodimers. Moreover, despite negative selection protocols we consistently observed a direct relation between the ability of T1E variants to bind ErbB-3 and their ability to induce ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. Because no sequences selective for ErbB-2 heterodimerization could be identified, our findings support a model in which ErbB heterodimerization is driven by receptor-mediated and not by ligand-mediated interactions. The construction of T1E has been described previously (28Stortelers C. Lenferink A.E. van de Poll M.L. Gadellaa M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Google Scholar). Residues in the linear C-terminal region after the sixth cysteine in pEZZ/Fx/T1E were replaced by the corresponding residues of TGF-α and NRG-1ॆ by means of splice overlap extension polymerase chain reaction. The initial PCR fragments containing the complementary overhang sequences were made using pEZZ/Fx/T1E, pEZZ/Fx/TGF-α, and the NRG-1ॆ gene in pNRG8-g3 (a gift from Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) as templates. The fragment for the C-terminal region of the optimized NRG-1ॆ (referred to as NRG-58 (30Ballinger M.D. Jones J.T. Lofgren J.A. Fairbrother W.J. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11675-11684Google Scholar)) was constructed using oligonucleotide primers containing mutations encoding Asn-His and Met-Ile substitutions. Mutant gene products were subsequently introduced in the pEZZ vector using theBamHI/SalI sites and verified by automated cycle sequencing. Production, purification, and characterization of recombinant T1E mutants was essentially performed as previously described (28Stortelers C. Lenferink A.E. van de Poll M.L. Gadellaa M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Google Scholar). Interleukin-3-dependent murine 32D hematopoietic progenitor cells transfected with distinct human ErbB-encoding viral vectors or plasmids were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 107 heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 0.25 ng/ml murine interleukin-3 (Promega, Madison, WI) and kept under continuous selection using 0.6 mg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) or 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma) (12Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Google Scholar). The human mammary carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-453 was cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum. Recombinant human NRG-1ॆ176–246 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and T1E were radioiodinated using the Iodogen method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol for indirect labeling, resulting in a specific activity of 40–80 ॖCi/ॖg of protein. Ligand displacement analyses on 32D cells were performed as described (28Stortelers C. Lenferink A.E. van de Poll M.L. Gadellaa M. van Zoelen C. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4292-4301Google Scholar). A phage library of T1E randomized by mutation to NNS codons (N = G/T/A/C, S = G/C) at positions Tyr-46, Arg-47, Asp-48, Leu-49, and Lys-50 (T1E numbering) was constructed by a PCR-based approach using fUSE5/T1E as template (29Stortelers C. Souriau C. van Liempt E. van de Poll M.L. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8732-8741Google Scholar, 31Souriau C. Fort P. Roux P. Hartley O. Lefranc M.P. Weill M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1585-1590Google Scholar). The randomized region in the peptide growth factor was directly followed by the SfiI restriction site, thereby omitting the EGF residues Trp-51 to Arg-55. Because the randomized sequence was located in close proximity of the pIII fusion point, a flexible (Gly-Gly-Gly-Ser)2 linker sequence was introduced in the wild-type fUSE5 vector after the secondSfiI site before to the gene encoding pIII. Wild-type fUSE5 contains an out-frame stuffer fragment between the SfiI sites, thereby eliminating background phage (32Smith G.P. Scott J.K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 228-257Google Scholar). The PCR fragments encoding the randomized T1E gene were cloned into the fUSE5/linker phage vector using both SfiI sites. Ligation products were processed and electroporated into Escherichia coli TG-1 cells (Stratagene) for phage production. The number of independent transformants was determined by titration on tetracycline-containing plates to estimate the size of the library. Randomly picked clones from the library were analyzed by cycle sequencing (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to confirm the diversity of codon use and the expected amino acid distribution. Phage preparations were carried out after standard polyethylene glycol 8000/NaCl precipitation procedures. Titers of filter-sterilized phages were estimated by both titration and spectrophotometric determination and expressed as titraing units (tu). Gene constructs encoding the extracellular domain of human ErbB receptors were fused to the hinge and Fc regions of the human IgG1 heavy chain (referred to as ErbB-IgG (33Chen X. Levkowitz G. Tzahar E. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ben-Baruch N. Leitner O. Ratzkin B.J. Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7620-7629Google Scholar)). Subconfluent HEK-293 cells were transfected with the expression vector pCDM7/IgB3 or a mixture of pCDM7/IgB3 with pCDM7/IgB2 using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Conditioned culture supernatants containing the soluble dimeric IgG fusion proteins were harvested 5–10 days after transfection and purified by affinity chromatography on a 1-ml Hi-trap protein A-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences). Purified IgG fusion proteins were eluted with 0.1 m citric acid, pH 4.2, into tubes containing 1 m Tris, pH 9.0. ErbB-IgG preparations were quantified by Fc-ELISA using human IgG as a standard, whereas the purity and presence of dimeric species was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis and immunoblotting with polyclonal antibodies directed against human Fc (Nordic, Tilburg, NL). Nunc immunoabsorbant wells were precoated overnight at 4 °C with 0.2 ॖg of goat-anti-human Fc-specific IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) in 100 ॖl of PBS (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mmKH2PO4). Wells were washed in PBS, 0.057 (v/v) Tween 20 (washing buffer) and blocked for 1 h in 0.2 ml of PBS, 0.27 (w/v) BSA (blocking buffer) at room temperature. Next, wells were coated with 100 ng of ErbB-3-IgG for 2 h in PBS, 0.27 BSA, 0.057 Tween 20 (binding buffer). Wells were rinsed twice and incubated with 1–3 × 1010 tu T1E46–50 phages in 0.1 ml of binding buffer. After incubation for 2 h, unbound phages were removed by rinsing 12 times with washing buffer. Bound phages were eluted by the addition of 0.1 ml of glycine buffer (50 mmglycine, 150 mm NaCl, pH 2.7) for 10 min, and the eluate was neutralized with 25 ॖl of 1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. The eluate was used for phage titration and infection of logarithmic cultures of TG-1 cells. Phage selections on MDA-MB-453 cells were carried out by incubation of 5–10 × 106cells in suspension with 1–3 × 1010 tu T1E46–50 phages in 3 ml of blocking buffer. In the case of ErbB-3-IgG depletion, the phages were subjected to ErbB-3-IgG as described above before cell selection. The unbound phages from ErbB-3-IgG wells were subsequently transferred to 12-ml Falcon tubes, diluted to 3 ml with binding buffer, and added to MDA-MB-453 cells. After incubation for 2 h on a rowing boat shaker, cells were rinsed 7 times in washing buffer by spinning for 4 min at 1000 rpm followed by resuspension and a final wash with PBS. Cells were transferred twice to clean tubes to remove phages non-specifically bound to the plastic. Specific elution was performed by competition with a 1:1 mixture of the anti-ErbB-2 monoclonal antibodies L26 and L96 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA (34Klapper L.N. Vaisman N. Hurwitz E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Yarden Y. Sela M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2099-2109Google Scholar)) at 50 ॖg/ml in binding buffer for 1 h at 4 °C on a rowing boat shaker. Cells were spun, and the supernatant was collected as ErbB-2/ErbB-3 phage fraction. The remaining cell-bound phages were harvested by a 10-min incubation in 1 ml of acid elution buffer followed by neutralization upon adding 0.2 ml of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Cells were spun for 5 min at 1200 rpm, and the eluate was collected as ErbB-3 fraction. The distinct eluted fractions were used for phage titration and infection of logarithmic cultures of TG-1 cells. Small scale phage preparations were used for the screening of individual clones in ELISA assays. PEG 8000 precipitates of culture broth of clones grown overnight in 2 ml 2× TY (16 g/liter bacto-tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast, 5 g/liter NaCl) supplemented with 12.5 ॖg/ml tetracycline in 12-well plates were resuspended in 100 ॖl of PBS, typically resulting in phage titers of 1–5 × 1010 tu/ml. Whole cell ELISAs on 32D sublines in suspension were performed as described (29Stortelers C. Souriau C. van Liempt E. van de Poll M.L. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8732-8741Google Scholar). The procedure for ErbB-IgG ELISA was similar as described (20Jones J.T. Ballinger M.D. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11667-11674Google Scholar), with the following modifications; homodimeric ErbB-3-IgG fusion proteins were coated at 50 ng/well, and heterodimeric ErbB-23-IgG fusions proteins were coated at 100 ng/well in 0.1 ml of binding buffer. 32D cells that coexpress ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 (D23 cells) were washed in RPMI 1640 medium to deprive them of interleukin-3. Subsequently cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at a density of 5.0 × 104 cells/well in 0.1 ml of RPMI supplemented with 0.17 BSA together with serial dilutions of filter-sterilized phages or recombinant growth factors. Cell survival was determined after 24 h of incubation at 37 °C using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as previously described (29Stortelers C. Souriau C. van Liempt E. van de Poll M.L. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8732-8741Google Scholar). Previous work showed that the chimeric EGF-like ligands biregulin and T1E bind only weakly to ErbB-3 due to sub-optimal sequences in the N-terminal linear region (26Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Google Scholar, 29Stortelers C. Souriau C. van Liempt E. van de Poll M.L. van Zoelen E.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8732-8741Google Scholar). The observed high affinity binding of T1E and biregulin for cells expressing both ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 thus appears to depend critically on additional stabilization of the complex by ErbB-2. The strong dependence on ErbB-2 as a dimerization partner makes this type of molecules a good model system for identifying residues that mediate the selective recruitment of ErbB-2 versusErbB-3 as a dimerization partner. In this study we have examined whether sequences in the C-terminal linear region of T1E play a direct role in the formation of ErbB-3 homodimeric and ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimeric complexes, as suggested by a comparison of the different NRG isoforms. Thereto we initially exchanged the C-terminal linear tail of T1E, composed of EGF sequences, for the corresponding sequences of TGF-α (Glu-44–Ala-50), NRG-1ॆ (Gln-45–Ala-51) and an optimized NRG-1ॆ mutant. This latter mutant has been obtained from a previous phage display study on NRG-1ॆ by selection for high affinity binding to ErbB-3 ectodomains and contains the mutations N47H and M50I compared with the wild-type NRG-1ॆ EGF domain (30Ballinger M.D. Jones J.T. Lofgren J.A. Fairbrother W.J. Akita R.W. Sliwkowski M.X. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11675-11684Google Scholar). The TGF-α C terminus was included because it shows the highest sequence similarity with optimized NRG-1ॆ and because previous studies indicate that introduction of TGF-α C-terminal residues into NRG-1α strongly enhances binding affinity for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers on SK-BR-3 cells (35Harris A. Adler M. Brink J. Lin R. Foehr M. Ferrer M. Langton-Webster B.C. Harkins R.N. Thompson S.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 220-224Google Scholar). The nomenclature used for the T1E mutants follows previously used conventions in which T1E6N is a chimera containing TGF-α sequences up to the first cysteine followed by EGF sequences up to the sixth cysteine and NRG-1ॆ residues in the C-terminal tail (Fig.1A). All T1E mutants were expressed as recombinant peptides in E. coli, finally purified by reverse-phase HPLC and verified for the appropriate molecular weight by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectroscopy analysis. The biological activity of the various T1E mutants was assessed by competitive binding analysis on stable transfectants of 32D cells that express defined ErbB combinations (12Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Google Scholar). Fig. 1B shows clear differences in the ability of the T1E mutants tested to displace radiolabeled T1E from 32D cells coexpressing ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 (D23 cells). The IC50 of both T1E6N and T1E6T (50–60 ng/ml) was increased compared with T1E itself (6.7 ng/ml), whereas T1E6Nopt bound D23 cells with enhanced affinity (3 ng/ml) comparable with wild-type NRG-1ॆ (2 ng/ml). Similar differences were observed in the ability of these T1E mutants to stimulate proliferation of D23 cells and the neuregulin-responsive MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, indicating that their relative binding affinity corresponded to the ability to activate ErbB-2/ErbB-3 complexes (data not shown). Thus, changes in the C-terminal sequences of T1E strongly affect its ability to interact with ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. Despite the fact that NRG-1ॆ is the natural activator for ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimersin vivo, its C-terminal sequences do not appear beneficial for the interaction with ErbB-2/ErbB-3 in a T1E environment. In this respect the EGF residues present in T1E appear more effective in stabilizing ErbB-2/ErbB-3 complexes than the corresponding NRG-1ॆ and TGF-α sequences. To further evaluate the role of the linear C terminus in binding to ErbB-3, the binding affinity of the T1E mutants was assessed by125I-labeled NRG-1ॆ displacement on 32D cells solely expressing ErbB-3 receptors (D3 cells). In agreement with cross-linking analyses, we assume that NRG-1ॆ is able to induce homodimeric ErbB-3 complexes in D3 cells (12Pinkas-Kramarski R. Soussan L. Waterman H. Levkowitz G. Alroy I. Klapper L. Lavi S. Seger R. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2452-2467Google Scholar, 26Tzahar E. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Moyer J.D. Klapper L.N. Alroy I. Levkowitz G. Shelly M. Henis S. Eisenstein M. Ratzkin B.J. Sela M. Andrews G.C. Yarden Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4938-4950Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that all T1E mutants have an affinity for ErbB-3 alone that is at least 50-fold lower than that of NRG-1ॆ. Compared with T1E, T1E6Noptshows increased binding affinity, whereas T1E6N and T1E6T have almost similar binding affinity. Thus, replacement of the C-terminal tail of T1E for NRG-1ॆ sequences did not significantly improve the weak binding of T1E to the ErbB-3 receptor. By contrast, introduction of the C-terminal tail of the optimized NRG-1ॆ variant increased the relative binding affinity of T1E for both homo-and heterodimeric ErbB-3 complexes, indicating these residues improve the recruitment of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3 independent of the context of the NRG molecule. Together these findings demonstrate that residues in the C-terminal region of T1E indeed contribute to the ligand preferences for distinct receptor complexes. To assess the precise contribution of individual residues in T1E to the recruitment of ErbB-2 or ErbB-3 into dimeric complexes, we randomly mutated five positions in the linear C terminus of T1E that correspond to the positions in the NRG isoforms implicated in differential ErbB binding using a phage display approach. By a combination of positive and negative selection strategies and specific elution methods we subsequently selected variants that discriminated between binding to ErbB-3 homodimers and to ErbB-2/ErbB-3 heterodimers. To this end we used homodimeric ErbB-3-IgG fusion proteins in addition to MDA-MB-453 cells, human breast carcinoma cells with overexpression of ErbB-2 and ErbB-3, which we have previously employed for affinity optimization o"

To conduct this unusual life cycle, poxviruses encode the enzymes employed in viral gene transcription, mRNA processing, genome replication, and recombination (1Moss B. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Griffin D.E. Martin M.A. Lamb R.A. Roizman B. Strauss S.E. Poxviridae: The Viruses and Their Replication: Virology. 2. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 2849-2883Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus, a member of the poxvirus family, is the strain employed as smallpox vaccine. Poxvirus gene expression is divided into three temporal classes that differ in their promoter sequences and the protein factors employed in transcription initiation (2Moss B. Ahn B.Y. Amegadzie B. Gershon P.D. Keck J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1355-1358Google Scholar). Early genes are transcribed in the virion core by a virus-encoded multisubunit RNA polymerase (3Baroudy B.M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4372-4380Google Scholar) that contains the Rap 94 subunit, the product of the H4L gene (4Ahn B.Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3536-3540Google Scholar, 5Kane E. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5752-5762Google Scholar). Early messages are capped (6Wei C.M. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3014-3018Google Scholar) and polyadenylylated (7Kates J.R. Beeson J. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 50: 19-33Google Scholar) by virus-encoded enzymes. Shut off of early gene transcription accompanies the onset of DNA replication. Among the early gene products are proteins that direct intermediate gene transcription (8Vos J.C. Sasker M. Stunnenberg H.G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2553-2558Google Scholar, 9Rosales R. Harris N. Ahn B.Y. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14260-14267Google Scholar). Late gene expression follows the accumulation of intermediate gene products, including late gene transcription factors (10Keck J.G. Baldick Jr., C.J. Moss B. Cell. 1990; 61: 801-809Google Scholar). Both intermediate and late gene transcription require a replicating template and also employ one or more host-encoded transcription factors (11Gunasinghe S.K. Hubbs A.E. Wright C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27524-27530Google Scholar, 12Rosales R. Sutter G. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3794-3798Google Scholar, 13Wright C. Oswald B. Dellis S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40680-40686Google Scholar). Unique of among viral gene classes, early gene transcription is subject to signal- and factor-dependent transcription termination (14Rohrmann G. Yuen L. Moss B. Cell. 1986; 46: 1029-1035Google Scholar). Termination requires the virion form of RNA polymerase, containing the Rap 94 subunit (15Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Google Scholar, 16Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20758-20765Google Scholar, 17Mohamed M.R. Christen L. Niles E.G. Virology. 2002; 299: 142-153Google Scholar), and VTF1 (18Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar), the vaccinia termination factor composed of the 97-kDa D1R subunit (19Morgan J.R. Cohen L.K. Roberts B.E. J. Virol. 1984; 52: 283-297Google Scholar) and the 33-kDa D12L subunit (20Niles E.G. Lee-Chen G.J. Shuman S. Moss B. Broyles S.S. Virology. 1989; 172: 513-522Google Scholar). VTF is also the virion mRNA capping enzyme employed in catalyzing the first three steps in cap formation (6Wei C.M. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3014-3018Google Scholar, 21Ensinger M.J. Martin S.A. Paoletti E. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2525-2529Google Scholar). In addition, ATPase activity catalyzed by nucleoside-triphosphate phosphohydrolase I (NPH I), the product of geneD11L, is essential for transcription termination and transcript release (22Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Google Scholar, 23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar). An interaction between the C-terminal end of NPH I and the N-terminal end of Rap 94 is required for termination (15Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Google Scholar, 16Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20758-20765Google Scholar, 17Mohamed M.R. Christen L. Niles E.G. Virology. 2002; 299: 142-153Google Scholar, 24Piacente S.C. Christen L.M. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Finally, termination also utilizes the sequence TTTTTNT present in the gene about 30 to 50 base pairs upstream from the map position of the early mRNA poly(A) addition site. The signal is recognized as UUUUUNU in the nascent mRNA (25Shuman S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21356-21360Google Scholar). One appealing model proposes that the UUUUUNU signal is recognized by an undefined essential termination factor and upon binding, this factor initiates the termination/release sequence of events. To further investigate the putative UUUUUNU recognition factor we employed RNA oligonucleotides containing UUUUUNU or a mutated sequence as potential inhibitors of transcription termination, in vitro. We hypothesized that binding of the UUUUUNU recognition factor to the UUUUUNU signal in the nascent mRNA would be inhibited in a sequence dependent fashion by the addition of a UUUUUNU containing oligonucleotide, resulting in an inhibition of termination. Analysis of RNA products synthesized in the presence of different concentrations of wild type and mutant UUUUUNU containing oligonucleotides showed that rather than observing an inhibition of termination, we found dramatically enhanced synthesis of truncated transcripts. In addition to the UUUUUNU containing oligonucleotide, the apparent premature termination required VTF, NPH I, Rap 94, and ATP or dATP, demonstrating that the normal viral termination machinery is employed. Oligonucleotide-dependent premature termination was independent of the TTTTTNT signal in the template and resulted in release of the termination products. Importantly, premature termination required UUUUUNU in the activating oligonucleotide, thus retaining the essential signal requirement as found in vivo. Thistrans-activation of transcription termination demonstrates that the cis-acting signal present in nascent transcripts can be overridden by an exogenous oligonucleotide, in vitro. This observation impacts on the mechanism of early gene transcription termination and provides a novel site for the development of potential anti-poxvirus agents. Wild type (WT) vaccinia virus strain WR and the temperature-sensitive mutant virus, tsC50, were propagated in BSC40 African green monkey cells at 37 °C, or the permissive temperature for ts mutants, 31 °C, respectively, as described (26Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Virology. 1981; 113: 224-241Google Scholar,27Condit R.C. Motyczka A. Spizz G. Virology. 1983; 128: 429-443Google Scholar). Virus titer was determined by plaque assay on BSC40 cells at the permissive temperature, 31 °C, and the nonpermissive temperature, 40 °C for tsC50 virus and at 37 °C for the WT virus. Transcription extracts were prepared from virus-infected cells by lysolecithin treatment, as described (23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar,28Condit R.C. Lewis J.I. Quinn M. Christen L.M. Niles E.G. Virology. 1996; 218: 169-180Google Scholar). A549 cells were infected with either WT virus or tsC50 mutant virus at a multiplicity of infection of 15, at 37 or 31 °C, respectively. After 24 h, the medium was removed and replaced with 40 °C medium containing 100 ॖg/ml cycloheximide. After a further 24 h at 40 °C, cells were washed and treated with 250 ॖg/ml lysolecithin and extracts were prepared. In the case of the tsC50 virus-infected cells, this procedure permits the initial synthesis of active NPH I, which is required for intermediate and late gene expression. After switching to 40 °C, the endogenous NPH I is inactivated and cycloheximide prevents the synthesis of new protein. Construction of the G21(TER29)A78 and G21(TER59)A78 templates was described (29Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar), and the plasmids containing these sequences were generously provided by Dr. Stewart Shuman of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The G21(TER29)A78 transcription unit contains a synthetic early promoter fused to a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette, which is followed by three G residues at positions +21 to +23. RNA synthesis in the absence of GTP and the presence of 3′ O-methyl GTP yields a 21-base product that can be identified by gel electrophoresis. A 57-nucleotide A-less cassette lies downstream of the G-less cassette and flanked at its 3′ end by four A residues at positions +78 to +81. A termination signal, TTTTTTTTT, lies within the A-less cassette, spanning positions +29 to +37 in the G21(TER29)A78 template. In the case of the G21(TER59)A78 template, the termination signal, TTTTTTTTT, lies within the A-less cassette, spanning position +59 to +67. The biotinylated 324-bp DNA template was amplified by PCR employing a 5′-biotinylated downstream primer and isolated by preparative agarose gel electrophoresis. The purified DNA fragment was then immobilized to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynabeads M280; Dynal) as described (30Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). The bead-bound (B) template (typically, 100 fmol) was first incubated with 4 ॖl of C50 or WT virus-infected cell extracts, in the presence of 1 mm ATP, 10 ॖCi of [α-32P]CTP (800 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mm UTP, and 0.625 mm 3′O-MeGTP to synthesize the G21 transcript. The ternary complex was isolated, washed twice with 0.5 ml of transcription salts, resuspended, and incubated in the presence or absence of VTF that was preincubated in the presence or absence of the oligo RNA for 10 min on ice, prior to incubation with the ternary complexes. Whenever mentioned, the ternary complexes were incubated in the presence or absence of IgG antibodies directed against different regions of the Rap 94 subunit of the virion RNA polymerase (the H4L protein), prior to their incubation with VTF and NPH I. Termination was then assessed after elongation of the ternary complex in the presence of 1 mm UTP, 1 mm GTP, 1 mm CTP, and 1 mm ATP. Elongation of the G21 RNA in the presence of all 4 NTPs to the end of the template, would yield a read-through transcript of about 177 bases in length. UUUUUNU-dependent termination would yield a termination product of about 70 bases in length. Greater than 907 of the isolated ternary complexes were routinely elongated in the second RNA synthesis reaction. RNA products were separated by gel electrophoresis, observed by autoradiography, and quantified by densitometry of the exposed film. Termination efficiency was calculated as the molar ratio of terminated RNA to the sum of read-through and terminated RNA. Bead-bound ternary complexes containing radiolabeled G21 RNA were constructed as described above using a tsC50 virus-infected cell extract. The ternary complex was isolated, washed, resuspended, and transcript release from the paused ternary complex was assessed in the presence or absence of VTF, NPH I, dATP, and oligonucleotides. After incubation for 10 min at 30 °C, the bound transcript was separated from the free RNA using a magnet, separated by gel electrophoresis, and analyzed as described above. To measure the time course of the G21 RNA release, G21 ternary complexes were prepared as described above using a tsC50 virus-infected cell extract. Reactions containing ternary complexes, NPH I, VTF, and dATP were set up and release was begun by the addition of the UUUUUNU oligonucleotide. At times after adding UUUUUNU, samples were taken and bound and free G21 RNA were separated using a magnet, and analyzed as described above. Prior studies demonstrated that short single stranded oligonucleotides inhibit overall transcription in vitro, exhibiting a preferential inhibition of termination (31Christen L. Sanders M. Niles E.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 36: 8072-8089Google Scholar). The observed inhibition was seen with DNA or RNA and was independent of the UUUUUNU signal essential for early gene transcription termination. To evaluate the effect of UUUUUNU containing oligonucleotides on transcription termination separate from their effect on transcription initiation and elongation, bead-bound templates were employed. Templates were described by the Shuman laboratory (29Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar) (Fig.1B), which permit initiation of transcription at a strong early promoter and elongation through a 20-nucleotide G-less cassette in the absence of GTP and the presence of 3′ O-methyl-GTP, yielding a 21-base RNA product referred to as G21 RNA. After isolation and washing the bead-bound ternary complex, elongation in the presence of all four nucleoside triphosphates and termination factors, NPH I (22Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Google Scholar, 23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar) and VTF (18Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar), either full-length transcripts or termination products are formed, which can be separated by gel electrophoresis and observed by autoradiography. Two templates were prepared that differ in the location of the termination signal T9 (Fig. 1B). Ter 29 locates the T9 signal starting at position 29, and Ter 59 has the termination signal starting at position 59. The position of the termination signal determines the length of the termination product. Two RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized (Fig.1A). The UUUUUNU oligonucleotide has a sequence identical to the nascent transcript synthesized from the Ter 29 template from base 21 to 42. In the mutant oligonucleotide, selected U residues were changed to A at positions 29, 30, 33, and 36 to yield an altered termination signal. The essential change is the A at position 33 that had been shown in the past to generate a sequence that was inactive in termination (32Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Google Scholar). Transcription competent extracts were prepared from cells infected either with wild type virus, or with a mutant virus, tsC50, harboring a ts mutation in the D11L gene, under conditions that yield an extract with reduced NPH I activity. Both extracts are naturally deficient in VTF (23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar, 33Condit R.C. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Virology. 1996; 220: 10-19Google Scholar) so maximum termination requires the addition of exogenous VTF, and in the case of C50 extract, both VTF and NPH I must be added. Transcription initiation and elongation to G21 permits the preparation of an isolated ternary complex and effectively separates transcription initiation from termination. The ternary complex can then be incubated with nucleoside triphosphates, oligonucleotides, and termination factors and the radiolabeled nascent RNA allowed either to elongate to the end of the template or to terminate in response to the UUUUUNU signal. The effect of RNA oligonucleotides containing a wild type or mutant termination signal on transcription termination was tested. Transcripts produced in the presence of increasing oligonucleotide concentrations were observed after separation by gel electrophoresis. In Fig.2A, lane 2, the major transcript produced in the absence of added VTF or oligonucleotide is the full-length read-through transcript (RT). Minor shorter products (P), including a collection of pause products at the T9 sequence (30Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar), and the un-elongated G21 RNA (lanes 1 and10) can be identified. Minimal termination (Term) can be seen because of the low level of endogenous VTF. When VTF is added,lane 3, there is a decrease in RT and an increase in Term, as expected when transcription is conducted with a wild type virus-infected cell extract (23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar, 33Condit R.C. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Virology. 1996; 220: 10-19Google Scholar). Upon the addition of VTF plus increasing concentrations of a 22-base RNA containing the U9 termination signal (lanes 4–9) one observes a decrease in Term reflecting an inhibition of transcription termination at the normal site. Rather than finding a corresponding increase in RT, however, there is a dramatic increase in the level of short transcripts (PT). The concentration of UUUUUNU oligonucleotide required for half-maximal PT production is about 2 nm. Titration of a 22-base RNA possessing a mutant termination signal exhibits a minor reduction in Term with a minor increase in shorter RNA products (Fig. 2B). Control studies showed that oligonucleotide addition to the virus-infected cell extracts did not stimulate nuclease activity (data not shown). These results demonstrate that addition of an oligonucleotide containing the U9 sequence directs the signal-dependent stimulation of premature transcription termination, in trans. To determine whether this phenomenon was template-dependent, the effect of oligonucleotide addition on transcription termination was evaluated using both the Ter 29 and Ter 59 templates. In Fig. 3, Aand B, transcription elongation of G21 RNA was carried out in the absence or presence of VTF, and the oligonucleotides. In the absence of added factors, there is minimal termination (lane 2). Upon the addition of VTF (lane 3), there is an increase in termination, and as expected, the termination product produced from the Ter 59 template is longer than that synthesized from Ter 29. Addition of the U5NU oligonucleotide but not the mutant oligonucleotide results in a decrease in the normal termination product and an increase in the synthesis of the prematurely terminated RNA from both templates (lanes 4 and 5). Each template yielded similarly sized premature termination products demonstrating that the ability of this oligonucleotide to direct the synthesis of short RNA is not template dependent. To assess whether VTF was required for oligonucleotide-directed stimulation of premature termination, the following study was conducted. RNA synthesis was carried out in the absence or presence of VTF and the U5NU oligonucleotide. In Fig.4A, lane 1, one observes primarily the synthesis of read-through RNA in the absence of added factors. When VTF is added (lane 3), the Term RNA accumulates. If the U5NU oligonucleotide is added in the absence of VTF, there is no change (lane 2). However, if the U5NU RNA is added in the presence of VTF (lane 4) the accumulation of the premature termination products is observed. When the VTF concentration is increased in the presence of the U5NU RNA (Fig.4B) there is a decrease in the synthesis of the read-through RNA and a marked increase in the synthesis of premature termination products. At high levels of VTF there is a reappearance of a low level of the normal termination product (Term), whereas the level of prematurely terminated RNA varies little. The normal termination products are formed from ternary complexes that escape UUUUUNU-directed premature termination. The requirement for NPH I for U5NU oligonucleotide-dependent generation of premature termination products was evaluated through the use of a transcription competent extract prepared from tsC50-infected cells, possessing reduced NPH I (23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar, 33Condit R.C. Xiang Y. Lewis J.I. Virology. 1996; 220: 10-19Google Scholar). In Fig.5A, lane 1, one can observe the expected RNA products in the absence of added factors. When the U5NU oligonucleotide (lane 2) is added, there is no change. When VTF is added (lane 3) there is a minor increase in the normal termination product (Term) because of a low level of endogenous NPH I in the tsC50 virus-infected cell extract. When VTF is added in the presence of U5NU (lane 4), there is a minor increase in premature termination products. If NPH I is added in the absence of VTF (lane 5) there is little stimulation of termination or of the level of prematurely terminated RNA in the presence of added U5NU (lane 6) because of the low level of VTF in the infected cell extract. However, if NPH I and VTF are added, normal termination is observed (lane 7). If U5NU RNA is added in addition, one observes the stimulation of premature termination (lane 8). As in the case of VTF, addition of increasing levels of NPH I results in enhanced premature termination, Fig. 5B. Early gene transcription termination was shown to require the N-terminal region of the Rap 94 subunit, the product of geneH4L (15Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Google Scholar, 16Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20758-20765Google Scholar, 24Piacente S.C. Christen L.M. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar). Antibodies that bind to the N-terminal end of Rap 94 prevent termination in vitro. A requirement for Rap 94 for premature termination was tested (Fig.6). In this case, a tsC50-infected cell extract was employed that was deficient in both VTF and NPH I activity. In the absence of added factors, the read-through RNA and pause products were observed (lane 2). Addition of VTF alone had little effect (lane 3) because the extract has low NPH I activity. Addition of VTF and NPH I resulted in the appearance of the normal termination product, Term (lane 4). Addition of UUUUUNU along with VTF and NPH I (lane 5) caused the accumulation of the PT products. As shown previously (16Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20758-20765Google Scholar), preincubation of the isolated ternary complexes with antibodies raised against the N-terminal but not the C-terminal region of Rap 94 inhibited normal transcription termination (compare lanes 8and 9). However, pretreatment of the ternary complexes with antibodies raised against the N-terminal region of Rap 94 but not those derived from the C-terminal region of Rap 94 prevented UUUUUNU oligonucleotide stimulation of premature termination (comparelanes 6 and 7). Early gene transcription termination requires energy generated by NPH I-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (22Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Google Scholar, 23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar). To evaluate the energy requirement for U5NU-stimulated premature termination the standard transcription protocol was modified. Radiolabeled G21 RNA containing ternary complexes were prepared. Elongation through the A-less cassette to A78 was carried out in the absence of added ATP, and the presence of dATP or cordycepin triphosphate. In Fig.7A, lanes 1 and2, display RNA was made in the presence of VTF, and the presence or absence of U5NU RNA. One observes the read-through RNA because of low levels of contaminating ATP. A prominent RNA product labeled A78 is formed because of pausing near A78 in the absence of added ATP. A78 migrates near the normal termination product, Term, which would be minimal in this assay because of the low level of ATP in these reactions (30Hagler J. Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10050-10060Google Scholar). When cordycepin triphosphate is added along with VTF (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8), one observes a failure to synthesize the read-through RNA because of the incorporation of the chain terminating base at A78. Addition of U5NU (lanes 4 and 8) stimulates premature termination indicating that cordycepin triphosphate can serve as an energy source. If dATP is added in the absence of cordycepin triphosphate (lane 5) one observes a failure to synthesize the read-through product. When U5NU is added (lane 6), premature termination products are observed demonstrating that dATP can serve as the energy source required for premature transcription termination. Addition of both cordycepin triphosphate and dATP has no additional effect (lanes 7 and 8). To determine whether the newly synthesized RNA products are released from the ternary complexes, after elongation, bound and free RNA were separated and analyzed by gel electrophoresis. In Fig. 7Bone observes that in the absence of added ATP, the RNA remains bound in the ternary complex whether U5NU is added or not (lanes 1–4). If an energy source is provided in the form of cordycepin triphosphate or dATP, the majority of the RNA products are released, A78, Term, and the premature termination products (lanes 5–16). Release occurs in the absence of added UUUUUNU oligonucleotide because of the fact that the Ter 29 template was employed that directs the synthesis of nascent RNA with an available UUUUUNU signal. Addition of the UUUUUNU oligonucleotide stimulates release in each case. To ensure that the endogenous U5NU does not contribute to the oligonucleotide-dependent stimulation of transcript release and to determine whether an extended RNA 5′ tail is needed, the ternary complex stalled at position G21 was employed in the transcript release assay because this complex was certain to possess a short nascent transcript that lacks U5NU. Ternary complexes were constructed using a tsC50 mutant virus-infected cell extract. Incubations of the isolated, washed ternary complexes were conducted in the absence or presence of NPH I, VTF, and dATP, in the absence or presence of oligonucleotides that contained either a wild type or a mutated UUUUUNU termination signal (Fig. 8A). When dATP is omitted (lanes 1–4) there is little release of G21 RNA because of the lack of an energy source. If VTF is omitted (lanes 5–8) there is a modest stimulation of release (167) when UUUUUNU RNA is added because of the low level of endogenous VTF in this assay. The mutant oligonucleotide has a much lower effect on release (lanes 7 and 8). If NPH I is omitted (lanes 11–14) a low level of transcript release is observed that is higher (227) when the UUUUUNU oligonucleotide is added rather than the mutant oligonucleotide (107). If oligonucleotide is not added (lanes 9 and 10) only 207 release is observed. However, in the presence of VTF, NPH I, and dATP a high level (577) of G21 RNA release can be observed in the presence of the UUUUUNU oligonucleotide (lanes 15 and 16). Only background release is observed when the mutant oligonucleotide is added (lanes 17 and 18). Release is rapid achieving near maximal release within 30 s after initiating the reaction (Fig. 8B). These results demonstrate that UUUUUNU stimulates a release factor that does not require ongoing transcription, is independent of the UUUUUNU signal in the nascent RNA, and does not require an extensive RNA 5′ tail. A current model for termination of vaccinia virus early gene transcription describes the interplay of the nascent mRNA, the virion RNA polymerase, VTF, NPH I, and the template DNA (34Condit R.C. Niles E.G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 325-336Google Scholar). NPH I is a single stranded DNA-dependent ATPase (35Paoletti E. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3281-3286Google Scholar, 36Paoletti E. Rosemond-Hornbeak H. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 273-280Google Scholar) that provides energy needed for transcript release (22Deng L. Shuman S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 538-546Google Scholar, 23Christen L.M. Sanders M. Wiler C. Niles E.G. Virology. 1998; 245: 360-371Google Scholar). The requirement for single stranded DNA for adoption of the active conformation indicates that NPH I is able to bind to DNA in an accessible region in the transcription bubble. Furthermore, studies demonstrated that the C-terminal end of NPH I must bind to the N-terminal domain of the RNA polymerase Rap 94 subunit (15Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25798-25804Google Scholar, 16Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20758-20765Google Scholar, 24Piacente S.C. Christen L.M. Mohamed M.R. Niles E.G. Virology. 2002; (in press)Google Scholar), the product of geneH4L. Loss of NPH I binding or antibody binding to Rap 94 prevents termination, in vitro. A role for VTF, the first termination factor to be identified (18Shuman S. Broyles S.S. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12372-12380Google Scholar), has not been defined. However, VTF is clearly required for transcript release, in vitro (29Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). The sequence UUUUUNU located upstream from the poly(A) addition site is essential for termination in vitro (32Yuen L. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6417-6421Google Scholar). Alteration of any U residue results in a reduction in termination efficiency. The UUUUUNU sequence resides 30 to 50 bases upstream from the 3′ end (37Yuen L. Moss B. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 320-323Google Scholar). This location places the UUUUUNU signal outside of the RNA polymerase in a region of the nascent mRNA that is not protected by the RNA polymerase from nuclease digestion (29Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). These two facts support a model in which the UUUUUNU sequence binds to an essential termination factor as a required step in transcription termination. Although VTF is a likely candidate, to date, there is no evidence to support this proposition. These studies were undertaken to test the hypothesis that a UUUUUNU recognition factor binds to UUUUUNU and participates in early gene transcription termination. Addition of exogenously added RNA containing a U9 sequence was expected to inhibit normal transcription termination by binding to the termination factor and preventing its association with the UUUUUNU sequence in the nascent transcript. A sequence-dependent reduction in the normal termination product was seen, as anticipated. Unexpectedly, the accumulation of short transcripts was also observed. Premature termination was not determined by the template because it was found when either the Ter 29 or Ter 59 templates were used. In addition, premature termination required not only the sequence UUUUUNU in the activating oligonucleotide but also VTF, NPH I, the N-terminal domain of Rap 94 and dATP, demonstrating that the normal transcription termination machinery was employed. Finally, UUUUUNU RNA was shown to stimulate the release of the G21 transcript from the isolated ternary complex. Because it was shown that RNA polymerase protects 18 bases of the nascent transcript from nuclease digestion, and the G21 RNA is not available for cap formation, in vitro (29Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar, 38Hagler J. Shuman S. Science. 1992; 255: 983-986Google Scholar), UUUUUNU oligonucleotide-dependent transcript release must not require an extensive interaction with the 5′ tail of the target RNA. The premature termination products vary somewhat in length from experiment to experiment. This is because of the variable efficiency of release factor stimulation. Although release of G21 RNA in the absence of elongation is efficient (Fig. 8), in practice, there is a competition between elongation and release, in vitro. Hybrid formation between the U9 oligonucleotide and either the nascent transcript or the template is not likely to contribute to premature termination. The nascent transcript lacks an oligo A sequence that would permit hybrid formation. The template strand has an A9 sequence, which could be a potential target for hybrid formation. However, G21 RNA is efficiently released from a ternary complex that has not reached the A9 sequence in the Ter 29 template. In addition, efficient premature termination is also observed with the Ter 59 template where the A9 sequence lies in a different sequence context. Finally a DNA oligonucleotide of the same sequence, where T is substituted for U, which would be fully capable of hybrid formation, has no effect on premature termination, in vitro. The most parsimonious model proposes that a UUUUUNU containing RNA oligonucleotide can bind to an inactive transcription termination factor and convert it to the active form. When activated, the termination factor initiates a sequence of events that results in release of the nascent RNA from the ternary complex. Normally, the activating UUUUUNU is present in the nascent RNA. This demonstrates that the newly formed transcript must be scanned by the recognition factor as transcription elongation proceeds. Because the termination occurs within 30 bases of the UUUUUNU sequence, scanning must be quite efficient. When the UUUUUNU signal is added in trans, however, the nascent transcript is disregarded and efficient transcript release is obtained without concomitant transcription elongation. Titration of the UUUUUNU containing RNA oligonucleotide exhibits a half-activation concentration of about 2 nm demonstrating a remarkably strong binding to the UUUUUNU recognition factor. The identity of the UUUUUNU recognition factor remains to be determined. VTF is a likely candidate because it is known to be required but lacks a termination function at this time. VTF is known to catalyze the first three steps in mRNA cap formation (6Wei C.M. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3014-3018Google Scholar, 21Ensinger M.J. Martin S.A. Paoletti E. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2525-2529Google Scholar), and in this capacity, VTF is an RNA-binding protein. At least two RNA interaction sites have been identified: one in the N-terminal 250 amino acids of the large D1R subunit (39Higman M.A. Christen L.A. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14974-14981Google Scholar, 40Myette J.R. Niles E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11936-11944Google Scholar) and the other in the C-terminal end of D1R, in the methyltransferase domain. Although VTF was reported to exhibit a modest binding preference for poly(U) (41Luo Y. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21253-21262Google Scholar), it is not clear whether this preferential affinity for Us is related to transcription termination, mRNA cap formation, or intermediate gene transcription, other known functions of VTF. It is important to keep a broad perspective in the absence of conclusive data. UUUUUNU could be recognized by an unknown termination factor that acts intrans. Alternatively, one of the components of the transcription complex, perhaps an RNA polymerase subunit, might bind to UUUUUNU and stimulate termination. Studies are underway to identify the UUUUUNU binding component and elucidate its role in transcription termination. It is interesting to note that in our assays, 20–307 of the ternary complexes are unable to terminate in response to added VTF and ATP. Evidence indicates that these same ternary complexes are not subjected to UUUUUNU oligonucleotide-directed premature termination because the level of read-through transcript is relatively constant throughout the UUUUUNU titration. The premature termination products accumulate at the expense of the normal terminated RNA. Similarly, a fraction of the ternary complexes formed at A78 do not respond to factor-dependent transcript release (29Deng L. Hagler J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19556-19562Google Scholar). It is likely that these complexes are missing an essential component that is not replaced simply by further addition of excess VTF or NPH I. UUUUUNU directly stimulates RNA release from about 807 of the G21RNA ternary complexes (Fig. 8B). Moreover, addition of UUUUUNU oligonucleotide to an ongoing transcription reaction results in near complete release of the nascent transcripts (Fig. 7B). These observations indicate that the ternary complexes are heterogeneous in regard to their ability to respond to normal and UUUUUNU-directed transcription termination. An understanding of the differences among the ternary complexes would provide information important to our understanding of the mechanism of early gene transcription termination.
