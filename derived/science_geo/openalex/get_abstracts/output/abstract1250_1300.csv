Type a cells showed hyperpolarizing, or off, responses and type b cells depolarizing, or on, responses. Carp thus resembles cat in the basic organization of on and off pathways in the retina."

Using reverse transcriptase products made from partially purified lysozyme, ovomucoid, and ovalbumin messengers from hen oviduct, we have characterized the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I reaction. We have optimized for a high yield of full length second strands under conditions which require only a small amount of mRNA. The effects of several parameters (time, enzyme levels, salt concentration, monovalent cation, and temperature) on the length of products synthesized by DNA polymerase I have been investigated. Each has a significant influence on the proportion of products which are full length. Under our conditions the three reactions are efficient in synthesizing full length duplex DNA from partially purified mRNA fractions or from total poly(A)-containing RNA."

Unlike the cells they resemble, the endosteal marrow cells showed an affinity for Sudan black, demonstrable nucleoli (Feulgen reaction), and an absence of hemoglobin. Assays showed that over one-half of the endosteal marrow cell population may be the colony-forming units, the CFU-S of Till and McCulloch. Thus, high concentrations of stem cells could be obtained from the endosteal bone surface by means of the present isolation technique."
https://openalex.org/W1505290993,"alpha-Fetoprotein has been prepared from human fetal tissue by procedures utilizing DEAE-Sephadex, concanavalin A-Sepharose, and isoelectric focusing. A major and a minor component with isoelectric points of 4.7 and 5.3, respectively, have been isolated and are similar to those prepared under various conditions by other investigators. The 4.7 material contains 2.4 mol of fatty acids/mol of protein, whereas the minor component is fat-free. The relative amounts of fatty acid vary somewhat with different preparations. The ranges found in three isolates were as follows: palmitic acid (8 to 11%), stearic acid (2 to 5%), oleic acid (10 to 28%), linoleic acid (7 to 15%), arachidonic acid (12 to 39%), and 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid (16 to 42%). Human fetal serum albumin contained 0.7 mol of fatty acid/mol of protein, with arachidonic acid and the docosahexaenoic acid comprising only 11.4% of the total. Removal of fatty acids by treatment with charcoal converted alpha-fetoprotein into material with an isoelectric point of pH 5.3. Addition of arachidonic acid to the lipid-free protein restored it to protein with a pH 4.7 isoelectric point, typical of the major native component. The possible role of the fatty acids in alpha-fetoprotein on the inhibition of various lymphocyte functions is projected."

We report here the derivation of three cloned hybrid cell lines which synthesise antibodies detecting different public antigenic specificities of the mouse H–2 complex. These hybrid cell lines can be grown in the mouse as ascites tumours, and the ascites fluids obtained contain large quantities of homogeneous anti-H–2 antibodies."
https://openalex.org/W2043694838,"A virus-specific protein of approximately 180,000 daltons has been identified in cells transformed by avian sarcoma virus. The protein, designated P180, includes immunological determinants of both viral core proteins and reverse transcriptase. Its tryptic peptides represent essentially the sum of those of the precursor of the core proteins (Pr76gag) and reverse transcriptase. Thus P180 must arise from the uninterrupted translation of gag and pol. The kinetics of its formation and decay suggest that P180 is the precursor of reverse transcriptase."
https://openalex.org/W2090957747,"A highly sensitive television camera (silicon intensifier target) has been combined with fluorescence microscopy to examine living cultured cells. This system is termed Video Intensification Microscopy (VIM). By using very small amounts of excitation light, one limits the damage to living cells from excessive illumination and is able to visualize fluorescence probes for periods up to 24 hr without bleaching. With VIM, the cellular uptake and fate of two rhodamine-labeled proteins, concanavalin A and α2 macroglobulin, have been followed for up to 24 hr. These proteins were first located in endocytic vesicles with a low phase density. Later, at 24 hr, α2 macroglobulin was located in phase-dense structures, probably secondary lysosomes. Both the fluorescent endocytic vesicles and lysosomes were observed to undergo saltatory motion. VIM combined with fluorescence promises to have a widespread application in the study of the behavior of living cells."
https://openalex.org/W2041885979,"A new method based on isofocusing electrophoresis in the study of the Gc (group-specific component) polymorphism, revealed differing electrophoretic patterns. These patterns can be explained by the existence of two codominant Gc1 subtypes. This hypothesis is in accordance with several family studies. These subtypes are called Gc1F and Gc1S. Eight hundred samples were analyzed, including three different populations: Caucasoid (a western Pyrenean valley), African (Pygmy Bi-Aka), and AMerindian (Quechua-Aymara, from Bolivia). These two subtype phenotypes cannot be explored with the usual technique. They were present in each population sample studied."
https://openalex.org/W2057964658,"The majority of the mRNA that specifies retrovirus glycoproteins is known to be derived from the 3' half of the genome. To examine whether the glycoprotein mRNA of murine leukemia viruses (MuLVs) might consist of portions derived from both the 5' and 3' ends of the viral genome, we performed hybridization with a 5'-specific probe and heteroduplex analysis with long reverse transcribed DNA. A 5' probe was made by purifying a discrete 50 nucleotide-long reverse transcript attached to its tRNA primer. This probe was found to hybridize to RNA of the size of glycoprotein mRNA--21S, poly(A)-containing RNA--indicating that the mRNA could have a 5' leader sequence. The 5'-specific sequences were studied by electron microscopic examination of hybrids between 21S RNA and the two longest discrete cDNA species synthesized in the endogenous reverse transcriptase reaction. One of these species, 8.8 kb long, is only made in the absence of actinomycin D, but it does not contain any self-complementary sequences, and therefore appears to be a complete transcript of the viral genome. The shorter of the two species, 8.2 kb long, is synthesized whether or not actinomycin D is present; it must terminate 500--600 nucleotides internal to the 5' end of the template RNA. The structures observed in heteroduplexes of 21S RNA and these DNAs indicated the presence of a leader sequence approximately 500 nucleotides long at the 5' end of the 21S RNA. Sequences comprising this leader segment in the 21S RNA mapped at the 5' end of the genome RNA; the rest of the 21S RNA consisted of sequences from the 3' portion of the genome. Analysis of heteroduplexes with 8.2 kb DNA suggested that actinomycin D could block the reverse transcription of most of the sequence in the genome RNA that appears as a leader in the 21S RNA."

https://openalex.org/W1538401560,"The non-histone proteins HMG-1, HMG-2, HMG-3, HMB-8, HMG-14, and HMG-17 (Goodwin, G. H., SANDERS, C., and Johns, E. W. (1973) Eur. J. Biochem. 38, 14) were purified from calf thymus. The apparent molecular weights on polyacrylamide gels run in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate of the high mobility group (HMB) proteins were determined. Those for HBG-1 and HMG-2 agreed with the molecular weights determined by sedimentation; that for HMG-17 was anomalously high. Antibodies against HMG-1 were elicited in rabbits. The interaction between HMG-1 and anti-HBG-1 was measured by quantitative precipitation and by the microcomplement fixation technique. Quantitative microcomplement fixation assays revealed that the indices of dissimilarity between HMG-1 and HMG-2, HMG-3, HMG-8, HMG-14, and HMG-17 were 2.0, 1.0, 3.8, 10.0, and 6.1, respectively. These correspond to 6%, 0%, 12%, 20%, and 16% sequence difference between HMG-1 and the other five HMG proteins, although the immunological distance between HMG-1 and HMG-14 may be too large to allow a good correlation between the sequence and the immunological reaction. Antibodies to HMB-1 bind to chromatin purified from calf thymus. Therefore, we suggest that the in situ organization of HMG proteins in chromatin and chromosomes may be studied by serological techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2078541887,"In rats, as reported in humans, chlordecone (Kepone) is excreted predominantly in the feces. Cholestyramine, an anion exchange resin, binds chlordecone in rat intestine, increases its excretion into the feces, and decreases its content in the tissues. The resin appears to offer a practical method for treating chronic poisoning with this and possibly with other lipophilic toxins."
https://openalex.org/W2169588346,"Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated that a subclass of the aminoglycoside antibiotics, those containing the drug fragment paromamine, stimulates mistranslation in cell-free protein-synthesizing systems derived from eucaryotic cells. We report here experiments which show that the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila (formerly T. pyriformis, syngen 1) is sensitive to the paromamine-containing aminoglycoside antibiotics. The drugs are active with respect to growth inhibition, inhibition of protein synthesis in the whole organism, inhibition of protein synthesis in vitro and the stimulation of mistranslation in cell-free protein-synthesizing systems. Because of their misreading properties, these drugs may be useful in isolating and propagating strains carrying mutations which can be translationally suppressed (that is, missense and nonsense mutations)."
https://openalex.org/W2050885096,"Abstract Two populations of differentiated, hemoglobin-containing cells have been identified in cultures of Friend murine erythroleukemia cells (Friend cells): terminally differentiated benzidine-positive (B+) cells that are no longer capable of proliferation and are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and their precursors, traversing B+ cells which undergo two or three cell divisions before reaching their terminally differentiated state. Thus Friend cells in suspension culture retain a limited capacity to synthesize DNA and divide after commitment to erythroid differentiation. We identified terminally differentiated cells using autoradiography after benzidine staining. We also developed a quantitative flow microfluorometric assay to distinguish cells that are terminally differentiated from those cells committed to differentiation but still capable of proliferation. We developed a purification procedure to isolate terminally differentiated Friend cells. Their DNA content was the same as that of the undifferentiated cells in G1 by both the diphenylamine reaction and a fluorescence assay. No loss of DNA was detected during the differentiation of Friend cells. As many as 72% of the total cells in a culture induced with DMSO (88% B+) were differentiated cells arrested in G1. As a control, a DMSO-resistant line derived from 745A neither differentiated nor arrested in G1 after growth in the presence of DMSO. The results of these studies were obtained using several compounds that induce differentiation and three independently isolated clones of 745A. We also observed arrest of differentiated cells in G1 with the two other well characterized, independently derived erythroleukemia cell lines, F4-1 and T3-C1-2."

https://openalex.org/W1978236162,"Abstract Translation of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) 35S RNA in a mRNA-dependent protein-synthesizing system results in the synthesis of polypeptides with apparent molecular weights of 200,000, 75,000 and 65,000 daltons. Each of these polypeptides was immunoprecipitable with anti-p30 serum, while only the 200,000 dalton size class was specifically recognized by antiserum prepared against purified reverse transcriptase. intracellular Pr200 gag-pol has been shown to contain p30 tryptic peptide sequences(Arcement et al., 1976) and to share antigenic determinants with the gag proteins p30, p15, p12 and p10 and the reverse transcriptase (Jamjoom, Naso and Arlinghaus, 1977). These results and others (Jamjoom et al., 1977) led us to the conclusion that Pr200 gag-pol is the initial translation product that leads to the formation of mature reverse transcriptase. In the present study, nine of eleven methionine-containing tryptic peptides found in a anti-reverse transcriptase-precipitable 80,000 dalton molecular weight virion polypeptide (p80 pol ) were contained in Pr200 gag-pol . In addition, virion p80 pol co-migrates in SDS-polyacrylamide gels with the major polypeptide found in partially purified preparations of active reverse transcriptase. The in vitro synthesized 200,000 dalton polypeptide was identical to intracellular Pr200 gag-pol as determined by comparing ion-exchange profiles of methionine-labeled tryptic peptides. The frequency of synthesis of the in vitro synthesized Pr200 gag-pol was 125 to 120 that of the combined synthesis of the 65,000 and 75,000 dalton gag precursors. A similar ratio of Pr200 gag-pol to Pr65 gag and Pr80 gag has been observed in viral infected cells. Thus 35S viral genomic RNA is an mRNA for both gag and pol gene products. Experiments with the arginine analogue canavanine suggest that the usual termination signal occurs after the translation of Pr80 gag . We propose that the Pr200 gag-pol results from an occasional read-through (5% frequency) of a single termination codon at the end of the gag gene."
https://openalex.org/W2003528729,"Succinyl derivatives of gramicidin were tested for their ability to form channels in planar artificial lipid bilayers. Both N-succinyldeformylgramicidin methyl ester and charged O-succinylgramicidin formed channels, but the channels had markedly different sizes and lifetimes. This implies that gramicidin forms channels by end-to-end association. However, the doubly charged N,O-bissuccinyldeformylgramicidin was inactive, which suggests that only end-to-end association of gramicidin may result in channel formation."

Vesicles resuspended in variable external sodium ion in the presence of gramicidin established sodium ion membrane diffusion potentials. Vesicles resuspended in choline or acetylcholine chloride became hyperpolarized upon addition of gramicidin. Hyperpolarization was subsequently partially reversed spontaneously by choline or acetylcholine influx, which was confirmed by gel filtration, to yield a new, less negative, stable membrane potential. Thus, acetylcholine and choline are taken up electrogenically by synaptic vesicles."
https://openalex.org/W1984858724,"Abstract The effect of H -2 genotype on the genetic expression of Friend oncovirus was studied using Friend virus-transformed cells differing genetically only at the H -2 locus. Seven lines and three sublines were examined with regard to expression of Friend virus and the murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein gp69/71, the structural proteins p30 and p15 (FMR), and reverse transcriptase. Our results confirm that H -2 b , H -2 g and H -2 kh cell lines were stable upon serial passage for production of infectious Friend virus, whereas the H -2 d and H -2 k cell lines ceased to release infectious virus after a relatively short time. Synthesis of viral proteins by these cell lines was independent of the synthesis of infectious virus in that some viral proteins continued to be synthesized by H -2 d and H -2 k cell lines in the absence of infectious virus. Reduction of viral proteins can be attributed to the loss of expression of individual viral genes. The temporal sequence of change suggests that the loss of protein expression may occur in a stepwise fashion; reverse transcriptase was reduced first, followed by p30 and p15, and gp69/71 last. The results confirm that p30 and p15 are coordinately expressed. In contrast, the expression of p30 and gp69/71 are noncoordinate, indicating that these proteins are regulated by independent genetic loci. Loss of viral genes did not occur, since cell lines which had previously ceased to synthesize viral proteins could be chemically induced to produce infectious NB tropic Friend viruses. These data suggest that for these H -2-congenic cell lines, there is an association of the H -2D b allele and the long-term production and release in vitro of both infectious virus and viral proteins."

An extra band appeared in the lactate dehydrogenase isozyme pattern, but this band was undetectable in serums containing antibodies to the e antigenic determinant. Prior separation of the lactate dehydrogenase isozyme-5 fraction by chromatography of serum on minicolumns of diethylaminoethyl-Sephadex-A50 improved electrophoretic identification of the extra band. Neutralization with antibodies to the e antigen as well as by antibodies to the homologous d or y component of the hepatitis B surface antigen removed the extra band; antibodies to the lactate dehydrogenase isozyme-5 removed both the normal and the extra enzymatic band of isozyme-5. This feature of the e antigen provides an assay system for laboratory diagnosis of potential clinical usefulness and suggests its possible role in pathogenesis of hepatocellular injury."
https://openalex.org/W1995043656,"Thymus-derived lymphocytes (T cells) show exquisite specificity in recognition of antigens, but the nature of the cell surface receptor is controversial. Although antigen recognition mediated by immunoglobulin variable (V) regions remains the minimal hypothesis, it has been extremely difficult to definitely establish the presence of immunoglobulins on these cells. Chicken antibodies, produced against the (Fab')2fragment of mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) and purified by binding to and elution from IgG-Sepharose 4B, bind to an endogenously synthesized surface component of guinea pig T cells. The binding occurred via a cross-reaction with murine k chain and a heavy chain determinant localized in the Fd region, and was visualized by immunofluorescence and immunoelectronmicroscopy using both transmission and scanning techniques. These data provide direct evidence for the presence of a surface component related to immunoglobulin on T lymphocytes."

https://openalex.org/W1570168033,"DNA complementary to ovalbumin mRNA and covalently bound to cellulose (cDNA-cellulose) was synthesized using avian myeloblastosis virus RNA-directed DNA polymerase. High concentrations of actinomycin D (200 migrogram/ml) were required to produce 97% inhibition of double-stranded DNA synthesis, but mRNA transcription was only slightly inhibited (14%). The conditions used for binding of mRNA to cDNA-cellulose permitted complete hybridization of ovalbumin mRNA in 10 min while stable poly(A):(dT) hybrids failed to form. The temperature at which 50% of the ovalbumin mRNA activity was eluted from cDNA-cellulose was 62 degrees in 0.01 M Tris.HCl. When a batchwise procedure of hybridization and elution was used, the total recovery of ovalbumin mRNA activity applied to the cDNA-cellulose was greater than 98%, indicating little if any degradation of mRNA. Ovalbumin mRNA activity eluted in each chromatographic run was 50 to 70% of that originally used for the synthesis of the cDNA-cellulose. When total polysomal RNA was subjected to chromatography, the bound fraction consisted of ovalbumin mRNA, rRNA, and material behaving like fragments of ovalbumin mRNA. Applying this fraction to cDNA-cellulose a second time eliminated the rRNA but not the presumptive fragments. Ovalbumin mRNA purified either once or twice was enriched between 43- and 56-fold over polysomal RNA in translational activity."
