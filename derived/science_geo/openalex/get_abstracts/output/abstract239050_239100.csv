https://openalex.org/W2170932434,"Delivery of macromolecules mediated by protein transduction domains (PTDs) attracts a lot of interest due to its therapeutic and biotechnological potential. A major reevaluation of the mechanism of PTD-mediated internalization and the role of endocytosis in this mechanism has been recently initiated. Here, we demonstrate that the entry of TAT peptide (one of the most widely used PTDs) into different primary cells is ATPand temperature-dependent, indicating the involvement of endocytosis. Specific inhibitors of clathrin-dependent endocytosis partially inhibit TAT peptide uptake, implicating this pathway in TAT peptide entry. In contrast, the caveolin-dependent pathway is not essential for the uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide as evidenced by the efficient internalization of TAT in the presence of the known inhibitors of raft/caveolin-dependent pathway and for cells lacking or deficient in caveolin-1 expression. Whereas a significant part of TAT peptide uptake involves heparan sulfate receptors, efficient internalization of peptide is observed even in their absence, indicating the involvement of other receptors. Our results suggest that unconjugated peptide might follow endocytic pathways different from those utilized by TAT peptide conjugated to different proteins.

Recent advances in the identification of new molecular therapy targets and disease-relevant proteins, accelerated by the completion of the human genome project, emphasized an importance of high molecular weight information-rich biomolecules, such as peptides, proteins, antisense DNA, and small interfering RNA, for molecular therapy. However, the delivery of proteins and nucleic acids into cells is greatly hampered by the low permeability of the cell plasma membrane to polar molecules. Not surprisingly, the discovery that a number of cationic peptides known as protein transduction domains (PTDs) 1The abbreviations used are: PTD, protein transduction domain; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HUVEC, high pressure liquid chromatography; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; LacCer, lactosylceramide. can facilitate cytoplasmic and nuclear delivery of a conjugated cargo has attracted a lot of interest (1Lindsay M.A. Curr.

Despite significant progress in the cytoplasmic and nuclear delivery of various cargo molecules using PTDs, the underlying mechanisms remain under active debate. Until recently, it was widely assumed that the internalization of cationic PTDs is an energyand receptor-independent process based on direct transport through the lipid bilayer (11Futaki S. Suzuki T.

On the other hand, there have been indications that uptake of full-length TAT protein, from which one of the most commonly used PTDs referred to as TAT peptide is derived, occurs via endocytosis and depends on cell surface heparan sulfate receptors (16Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Moreover, the validity of some of the important data, supporting a direct transport model for synthetic TAT peptide, has been questioned in several recent studies (17Lundberg M. Johansson M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 291: 367-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 18Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol.

It has been shown that apparent ATP and temperature independence of the cellular uptake of the TAT peptide as well as its fast nuclear accumulation results from experimental artifacts due to cell fixation and incomplete removal of cell-bound peptide (18Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Recently, the uptake of TAT and (Arg)9 peptides has been attributed to a vesiculation process inhibited by cellular ATP depletion and by low temperature (19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar). Although several very recent papers (20Console S. Marty C. Garcia-Echeverria C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol.

Matile S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 14348-14356Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 25Hariton-Gazal E. Rosenbluh J. Graessmann A. Gilon C. Loyter A. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4577-4586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In this work, we further clarify the mechanisms by which TAT peptide enters living cells. As in the case of the stable cell lines used in our earlier work, TAT entry into several different primary cells is found to be ATPand temperature-dependent, indicating the involvement of endocytosis. Judging from the effects of specific inhibitors, unconjugated TAT peptide enters cells mainly by a clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, whereas raft/caveolin-dependent pathway is not required for internalization. Although a significant part of TAT peptide uptake involves heparan sulfate receptors, these receptors are not a prerequisite for TAT entry. Peptide Synthesis and Labeling—Synthesis of TAT peptide with sequence GRKKRRQRRRPP was carried out by solid phase on a Pioneer peptide synthesizer (Applied Biosystems) following the Fmoc (N-(9fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry protocol. A cysteine was added to the C-terminal end of the peptide to provide a sulfhydryl group for ligation to a fluorochrome. Peptides were purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography and characterized by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight analysis (data not shown). Labeling with the fluorochromes was performed by conjugation with a 10 molar excess of the fluorochrome-maleimide derivatives (Molecular Probes) in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, for 4 h in the dark. Labeled peptides were purified by semi-preparative high pressure liquid chromatography, freeze-dried, and resuspended in deionized water. Peptides were stored frozen at -20 °C until further use. Cells and Cell Cultures—HeLa and HepG2 cells were cultured as exponentially growing subconfluent monolayers on 90-mm plates in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Wild type CHO cells (CHO-K1 cell line) and mutants lacking all glycosaminoglycans (pgsA-745 cell line) or heparan sulfate (pgsD-677 cell line) were cultured in 75-cm2 flasks in Vitacell Ham's F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. Primary HUVEC (human umbilical vein endothelial cells) cells were cultured as exponentially growing subconfluent monolayers on 90-mm plates in endothelial cell basal medium (Clonetics) supplemented with 2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 1 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 50 μg/ml gentamicin, 50 pg/ml amphotericin B, 0.75 μg/ml bovine brain extract, and 10 μg/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor. Peripheral blood, obtained from healthy donors, was collected in heparinized tubes. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque (Sigma) as described previously (26Dardalhon V. Jaleco S. Kinet S. Herpers B. Steinberg M. Ferrand C. Froger D. Leveau C. Tiberghien P. Charneau P. Noraz N. Taylor N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9277-9282Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Flow Cytometry—In the case of HeLa, HepG2, and human macrophages, exponentially growing cells were dissociated with a nonenzymatic cell dissociation medium (Sigma). 5 × 105 cells were plated and cultured overnight on 30-mm dishes. The culture medium was discarded, and cells were washed with NaCl/Pi, pH 7.3. NaCl/Pi was discarded, and cell monolayers were preincubated with Opti-MEM for 30 min. Subsequently, the cell monolayers were incubated, as described below, with peptides and drugs dissolved in Opti-MEM. Following incubation, cells were washed with NaCl/Pi and incubated for 10 min with 0.1% trypsin (with the exception of HUVEC, which were treated with 0.05% trypsin) to detach them and to remove surface-bound material. In some experiments membrane-bound peptides were removed by a 15-min incubation at 4 °C with 0.1% Pronase and 1 mm EDTA. After the incubation, one volume of serum was added to stop the trypsin (or Pronase) treatment and 10 volumes of NaCl/Pi were added to detach the cells completely. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g, washed with NaCl/Pi, centrifuged again, and resuspended in 500 μl of NaCl/Pi. In case of wild type and mutant CHO cells, exponentially growing cells were dissociated with a nonenzymatic cell dissociation medium and resuspended in serum-free Ham's F12K medium. Subsequently, 5 × 105 cells were incubated, as described in the figure legends, with 200 μl of TAT peptide dissolved in F12K medium. Following incubation, cell suspension was centrifuged at 800 × g, washed twice with 2 ml of cold NaCl/Pi, and incubated for 10 min with 200 μl of 0.1% trypsin to remove surface-bound peptide. Finally, cells were washed once with 2 ml of F12K medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and once with 2 ml of cold NaCl/Pi and resuspended in 500 μl of NaCl/Pi containing 10 μm propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) to exclude dead cells. Fluorescence analysis was performed with a FACScalibur fluorescence-activated cell sorter (BD Biosciences). A minimum of 30,000 events/sample was analyzed with the exception of HUVEC cells for which 10,000 events were analyzed. To quantify effects of various treatments on cellular uptake, the median of cell fluorescence distribution in experiment was normalized to the cell fluorescence distribution median in untreated control. Each experiment was performed at least twice in duplicate or triplicate. The means ± S.D. of a total number of analyzed samples (from 3 to 14) are indicated on the figures. The significance of the effects of various treatments as compared with untreated control was evaluated by paired Student's t test at the 95% confidence level. Uptake of TAT Peptide by Primary Cells Is ATPand Temperature-dependent—Although established cell lines are convenient and useful experimental models, many important biotechnological and biomedical applications involve primary cells. We studied the effects of ATP depletion and low temperature on TAT peptide uptake by human peripheral blood mononuclear macrophages and HUVEC endothelial cells. The primary cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide for 30 min, and the amount of internalized peptide was evaluated using FACS. As shown on Fig. 1, TAT uptake was greatly inhibited at 4 °C in both of the tested cell types. When cells were preincubated with sodium azide and deoxyglucose to deplete the cellular ATP pool, a smaller but still significant inhibition of TAT uptake was observed (Fig. 1). Temperature and ATP dependence of TAT uptake by the primary cells suggest that entry by endocytosis is a general mechanism of TAT internalization valid for primary cells rather than a mechanism characteristic only for established cell lines. Heparan sulfate receptors involved in TAT peptide internalization—Earlier works indicate that the uptake of either full-length TAT protein (16Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) or TAT peptide conjugated to streptavidin (20Console S. Marty C. Garcia-Echeverria C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) depends on the presence of heparan sulfate receptors. To evaluate the role of heparan sulfates on the uptake of nonconjugated TAT peptide, wild type CHO cells (CHO-K1 cell line) or mutant cells lacking surface heparan sulfate (pgs-A745 and pgs-D677 cell lines) were incubated with 10 μm fluorescein-labeled TAT peptide for 30 min. Peptide uptake was significantly inhibited in mutant cells lacking surface heparan sulfates compared with wild type CHO cells (Fig. 2, A and B). However, a significant amount of peptide was internalized even in the absence of heparan sulfate receptors (Fig. 2A). In control experiments, no decrease in the uptake of the lypophilic dye FM 4-64, a heparan sulfate-independent marker of endocytosis, was observed in both mutant cell lines compared with wild type cells (Fig. 2B). The involvement of heparan sulfate receptors in TAT peptide was confirmed with another experimental approach. The pretreatment of cells with heparinase III inhibited TAT uptake in wild type cells but not in heparan sulfate receptor-deficient cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Although these data indicate the importance of heparan sulfate receptors for the uptake of TAT peptide in wild type CHO cells, Fig. 2 also shows TAT internalization in the absence of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, indicating the existence of heparan sulfate-independent mechanisms of entry. TAT Peptide Uptake Involves Caveolin-independent Pathways of Endocytosis—The uptake of TAT peptide fused to proteins has been recently attributed specifically to caveolin-dependent pathway (21Ferrari A. Pellegrini V. Arcangeli C. Fittipaldi A. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 284-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 22Fittipaldi A. Ferrari A. Zoppe M. Arcangeli C. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34141-34149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In contrast, in our earlier work (19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar), efficient uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide was observed in a number of cell lines deficient in caveolin-1 expression, including Jurkat T cell line and HeLa cells (27Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Likewise, we observed an ATP- and temperature-sensitive uptake of TAT in HepG2 hepatoma cells (data not shown), which have been reported to lack caveolin-1 (28Fujimoto T. Kogo H. Nomura R. Une T. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3509-3517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To specifically test whether internalization of free TAT peptide involves caveolin-dependent endocytosis, we explored the effects of nystatin and filipin III, both known inhibitors of caveolin-dependent uptake (29Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors had little effect on the uptake of Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide in HeLa cells (data not shown). That is not surprising considering the low level of caveolin-1 expression in these cells and the inefficient internalization of a well established marker of raft/caveolin-dependent endocytic pathway, BODIPY-lactosylceramide (BODIPY-LacCer) (27Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Importantly, in CHO cells, which efficiently express caveolin-1 and actively internalize BODIPY-LacCer (27Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), the uptake of Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide incubation also was not significantly affected in the presence of 50 μg/ml nystatin (Fig. 3, A and D), whereas in the same conditions, the uptake of BODIPY-LacCer was inhibited by ∼30% (Fig. 3, B and D). As expected, nystatin had no effect on the uptake of fluorescein-tagged transferrin (Fig. 3, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that cellular uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide does not require raft/caveolin-dependent endocytic pathway. Cellular Uptake of TAT Peptide Involves Clathrin-dependent Endocytosis—To test whether TAT uptake involves clathrin-coated pit-mediated endocytosis, TAT uptake was measured in the presence of known inhibitors of this endocytic pathway, potassium depletion, and chlorpromazine. Treatment of HeLa cells with chlorpromazine (a 30-min preincubation in the presence of 30 μm chlorpromazine followed by a 30-min incubation with both 30 μm chlorpromazine and 1 μm Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide) resulted in a 50% inhibition of peptide uptake (Fig. 4, A and C). Similarly, a 30-min preincubation of HeLa cells in potassium-free buffer followed by a 5-min hypotonic shock and a 30-min incubation with 1 μm Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide in potassium-free buffer resulted in a 40% decrease in peptide uptake (Fig. 4, B and C). In control experiments, significant inhibition was observed for the uptake of fluorescently labeled transferrin, a well established marker of clathrin-dependent endocytosis (Fig. 4C). Inhibition of the uptake of Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide and fluorescein-tagged transferrin in potassium-free buffer was completely reversible upon replenishment of potassium in the medium (Fig. 4, B and C). These data indicate that, in the absence of active caveolin-dependent endocytosis, TAT peptide is efficiently internalized by clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway. To test the involvement of clathrin-dependent pathway in cells efficiently expressing caveolin-1, we explored the effect of potassium depletion on the TAT peptide uptake in CHO cells, which efficiently express caveolin-1 (27Singh R.D. Puri V. Valiyaveettil J.T. Marks D.L. Bittman R. Pagano R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3254-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Cellular internalization of Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide (Fig. 5, A and C) was inhibited by ∼55% in potassium-free buffer as compared with ∼85% inhibition of fluorescein-tagged transferrin uptake (Fig. 5, B and C). Again, as with HeLa cells, inhibition for both Alexa Fluor 488-tagged TAT peptide and fluorescein-tagged transferrin was completely reversible upon replenishment of potassium in the medium (Fig. 5). These data indicate that, even in cells efficiently expressing caveolin-1, the uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide involves clathrin-dependent pathway of endocytosis. Internalized TAT Peptide Is Targeted to Acidic Compartments—As endocytosed proteins pass from early to late endosomes and to lysosomes, the vesicular compartments undergo progressive acidification. Even early endosomes show a reduction in pH (from pH 5.9 to 6.0) to promote the release of ligands bound to receptors. Acidification of these luminal compartments is blocked by agents such as monensin (30Monsigny M. Roche A.C. Midoux P. Biol. Cell. 1984; 51: 187-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To test whether endocytosed TAT peptide is targeted into acidified compartments, we took advantage of the fact that the fluorescence of fluorescein significantly decreases at pH 5-6, typical for endosomes and lysosomes compared with fluorescence at pH 7.4 of cell culture medium. We incubated HeLa cells with 2 μm fluorescein-tagged TAT for 60 min followed by 30 min of incubation in the presence or in the absence of 50 μm monensin at 4 °C. As shown on Fig. 6, B and C, incubation in the presence of monensin resulted in a significant increase in the cell-associated fluorescence. To verify that the higher fluorescent signal was due to a pH-dependent increase in the fluorescence of TAT-fluorescein within acidified compartments, the fluorescein tag was replaced with an Alexa Fluor 488 probe, which does not alter with pH (in the pH 5-8 range). In contrast to cells with TAT-fluorescein, the fluorescence of cells incubated with TAT-Alexa Fluor 488 was not affected by monensin (Fig. 6, A and C). These experiments indicate that a significant fraction of the TAT peptide is delivered into acidic cellular compartments. Although the number of publications confirming the great potential of PTDs for cellular delivery of many important compounds is increasing each year (1Lindsay M.A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), the mechanism of PTD-mediated delivery remains elusive. For about a decade, it was commonly accepted that, despite their highly polar nature, PTDs are able to rapidly and efficiently translocate directly through the lipid bilayer, thus delivering their cargo into the cytoplasm and nucleus in a receptor- and energy-independent way (14Vives E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2071) Google Scholar, 15Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model was supported by a large number of indirect evidence including temperature, ATP, and receptor independence of cellular uptake (11Futaki S. Suzuki T. Ohashi W. Yagami T. Tanaka S. Ueda K.

Persson D. Karlsson M. Norden B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 32Kramer S.D. Wunderli-Allenspach H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1609: 161-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Moreover, it was recently shown that apparent ATP and temperature independence and fast kinetics of PTD uptake result from artifacts of cell fixation and incomplete removal of surface-bound peptide (18Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J.

These recent findings have led to a major reevaluation of key characteristics of PTD internalization and the role of endocytosis in PTD-mediated uptake. Our present results indicate that fluorescently labeled TAT peptide as full-length TAT protein (16Tyagi M. Rusnati M. Presta M. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3254-3261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) or TAT-streptavidin conjugate (20Console S. Marty C. Garcia-Echeverria C. Schwendener R. Ballmer-Hofer K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 35109-35114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) uses heparan sulfate receptors for internalization. However, the uptake of small basic peptides such as the TAT PTD might be also mediated by other pathways as suggested by the fact that the internalization of TAT peptide is not completely inhibited in cells lacking surface heparan sulfates due to mutations or enzymatic treatment. The observed promiscuity of TAT peptide in terms of receptor use is not very surprising given the highly cationic nature of the peptide and the abundance of negatively charged moieties on the cell surface. Therefore, one might expect that, in addition to specific interactions with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, there may well be a high level of electrostatic interactions with other negatively charged cell surface determinants. The importance of cell surface receptors for TAT uptake, mentioned above and ATP and temperature dependence as shown in this and earlier work (18Lundberg M. Wikstrom S. Johansson M. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 19Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar) demonstrate that TAT peptide uptake involves endocytosis. In some of the recent reports arguing for the crucial role of endocytosis in the uptake of constructs in which the TAT peptide was fused to proteins, the uptake has been attributed specifically to caveolae-dependent pathway (21Ferrari A. Pellegrini V. Arcangeli C. Fittipaldi A. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 284-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 22Fittipaldi A. Ferrari A. Zoppe M. Arcangeli C. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34141-34149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found cells deficient in caveolin-1 expression or cells lacking caveolin-1 to be able to efficiently internalize unconjugated TAT peptide. This indicates that caveolin-dependent pathway is not required for TAT peptide uptake, and alternative pathways might be utilized for uptake of TAT in those cells. Therefore, we tested the effects of various inhibitors of clathrin- and caveolae-dependent endocytosis on the uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide. For both caveolin-1-expressing and caveolin-1-deficient cells, inhibitors of clathrin-dependent pathway (potassium depletion and chlorpromazine) significantly decrease TAT peptide uptake, whereas inhibitors of raft/ caveolin-dependent pathway (nystatin and filippin III) have no significant effect on the uptake. These findings support an involvement of endocytosis in the TAT internalization and show that clathrin-dependent pathway is involved in the cellular uptake of unconjugated TAT, whereas raft/caveolin-dependent pathway does not play a significant role. Along the same lines, the full-size TAT protein is internalized by a clathrin-dependent pathway (33Vendeville A. Rayne F. Bonhoure A. Bettache N. Montcourrier P. Beaumelle B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2347-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In contrast to our results, recent reports on the cellular uptake of TAT peptide conjugated to proteins in HeLa and CHO cells have attributed the uptake of these conjugates to caveolin-dependent pathway (21Ferrari A. Pellegrini V. Arcangeli C. Fittipaldi A. Giacca M. Beltram F. Mol. Ther. 2003; 8: 284-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 22Fittipaldi A. Ferrari A. Zoppe M. Arcangeli C. Pellegrini V. Beltram F. Giacca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34141-34149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy suggests that free TAT peptide and TAT peptide conjugated to macromolecules utilize different pathways for internalization, possibly due to difference in receptor usage. Interestingly, a recent report (34Wadia J.S. Stan R.V. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar) on the uptake of TAT conjugated to Cre recombinase in T cells, which are deficient in caveolin-1, implicates caveolin-independent lipid raft macropinocytosis in transduction of TAT-Cre recombinase into cells. Very recently, lipid raft macropinocytosis also has been implicated in the uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide (35Kaplan I.M. Wadia J.S. Dowdy S.F. J. Controlled Release. 2004; 102: 247-253Crossref Scopus (580) Google Scholar). However, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, which was used in this work to inhibit raft/caveolin-dependent pathway, has been shown to affect clathrin-dependent pathway (36Rodal S.K. Skretting G. Garred O. Vilhardt F. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 961-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar), thus complicating interpretation of the data. Taken together, these data indicate that alternative pathways could be used for TAT uptake depending on cell type and nature (and presence) of conjugated cargo. It is possible that, whereas free fluorescently labeled TAT peptide is mainly directed into constitutive clathrin-dependent pathway, TAT peptide conjugated to macromolecular cargo upon binding to cellular receptors induces signaling cascades activating caveolin-dependent endocytosis or macropinocytosis. Whatever the case, our results confirm that endocytosis is a major route of TAT peptide internalization. It is generally accepted that endocytosed material is targeted to late endosomes or lysosomes, compartments that contain active proteases and are involved in the degradation of internalized proteins and other macromolecules. In our experiments with monensin, an inhibitor of endosome acidification, we found that, within 1 h, at least a part of the TAT peptide is delivered into acidic compartments. Trapping and possible degradation of TAT peptides within these acidic vesicles is at odds with effective delivery of bioactive transported cargo within cytoplasm and/or nucleus. Nevertheless, the delivery of functionally active proteins into the cytoplasm and the nucleus (7Nagahara H. Vocero-Akbani A.M. Snyder E.L. Ho A. Latham D.G. Lissy N.A. Becker-Hapak M. Ezhevsky S.A. Dowdy S.F. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1449-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar, 9Joshi S.K. Hashimoto K. Koni P.A. Genesis. 2002; 33: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Peitz M. Pfannkuche K. Rajewsky K. Edenhofer F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4489-4494Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) has been well documented. This apparent discrepancy could be explained by different sensitivities of the experimental approaches. Whereas in our experiments we measure the total amount of internalized peptide, the delivery of only a negligible fraction of total TAT conjugate to the cytoplasm or to the nucleus might be sufficient for functional detection of the transduction with very sensitive biological assays as an end-point. Therefore, it is possible that only a small fraction of all internalized conjugated cargo molecules is actually delivered into the cytoplasm or nucleus. There are several hypothetical mechanisms by which PTDs can facilitate transduction of macromolecules into the cell. First, it is possible that, once inside, endosomes, TAT, and other cationic PTDs destabilize the endosomal membrane to leak a portion of the enclosed macromolecules into the cytoplasm as reported for polyethyleneimine (37Boussif O. Lezoualc'h F. Zanta M.A. Mergny M.D. Scherman D. Demeneix B. Behr J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7297-7301Crossref PubMed Scopus (5654) Google Scholar). TAT-induced destabilization of endosomes might involve TAT interactions with proteins or lipids specific to endosomal compartments. These interactions can be promoted by acidic pH inside endosomes. It is also possible that a functionally relevant fraction of the TAT peptide utilizes the caveolin-dependent endocytic pathway that bypasses acidic cellular compartments. This pathway is used by some viruses as described recently (38Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar) for SV40. Finally, one cannot exclude the possibility that a small but nevertheless all-important fraction of the TAT peptide directly crosses the lipid bilayer to deliver conjugated cargo into the cytoplasm. This latter mechanism was additionally supported by the recent study (39Terrone D. Sang S.L. Roudaia L. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13787-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), demonstrating direct translocation of penetratin (another well studied PTD) through protein-free synthetic lipid bilayers. Translocation of penetratin was shown to be lipid composition-dependent, requiring the presence of anionic lipids and high (>100 mV) transmembrane potentials, and was observed in a much slower time frame than previously expected (several hours rather than minutes) (39Terrone D. Sang S.L. Roudaia L. Silvius J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13787-13799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). This slow direct translocation of PTD through membranes might be of importance for the release of PTD from endosomes and lysosomes into the cytosol. In conclusion, our experiments further substantiate the key role of endocytosis in the PTD entry into living cells and provide new insights into utilized endocytic pathways and surface receptors. We believe that these results along with future work involving sensitive functional assays will bring a better understanding of the mechanisms by which relatively short PTDs deliver large cargos to the cytosol and nucleus.

J. 2004; 86: 254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) on TAT peptide interaction with soluble heparan sulfate that supports our conclusion on the involvement of heparan sulfate receptors in the cellular uptake of unconjugated TAT peptide.

https://openalex.org/W1970579593,"Although radiation-induced bystander effects have been demonstrated in a number of cell types, the studies have largely been performed using high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation, such as alpha-particles. The literature is contradictory on whether fibroblasts show bystander responses, especially after low LET radiation such as X- or gamma-rays and whether the same signal transmission pathways are involved. Herein, a novel transwell insert culture dish method is used to show that X-irradiation induces medium-mediated bystander effects in AGO1522 normal human fibroblasts. The frequency of micronuclei formation in unirradiated bystander cells increases from a background of about 6.5% to about 9-13% at all doses from 0.1 to 10 Gy to the irradiated cells. Induction of p21Waf1 protein and foci of gamma-H2AX in bystander cells is also independent of dose to the irradiated cells above 0.1 Gy. In addition, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased persistently in directly irradiated cells up to 60 h after irradiation and in bystander cells for 30 h. Adding Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase to the medium decreases the formation of micronuclei and induction of p21Waf1 and gamma-H2AX foci in bystander cells, suggesting oxidative metabolism plays a role in the signaling pathways in bystander cells. The results of clonogenic assay of bystander cells showed that survival of bystander cells decreases from 0 to 0.5 Gy, and then is independent of the dose to irradiated cells from 0.5 to 10 Gy. Unlike the response with p21Waf1 expression, gamma-H2AX foci and micronuclei, adding SOD and catalase has no effect on the survival of bystander cells. The data suggest that irradiated cells release toxic factors other than ROS into the medium."
https://openalex.org/W2055057101,"Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis protein that also plays critical roles in regulating the cell cycle and mitosis. Its prominent expression in essentially all human malignancies, and low or absent expression in most normal tissues, suggests that it would be an ideal target for cancer-directed therapy. Impeding development of safe and effective survivin antagonists for clinical use is a lack of understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which survivin differentially affects apoptosis and cell division, in normal and malignant cells. We show that the diverse functional roles of survivin can be explained, in part, by its heterodimerization with survivin splice variants in tumor cells. Survivin and survivin-ΔEx3 interact within the mitochondria where they may inhibit mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. If the expression of all survivin forms is eliminated by siRNA transfections, cells undergo both apoptosis and defective cell division. Overall, we provide new insights suggesting that targeting specific survivin isoforms, rather than survivin alone, may selectively and effectively destroy tumor cells. These findings are likely to have a significant impact in the design of biologic agents for clinical therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2064662817,"Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF beta1) is a well-characterized cytokine that suppresses epithelial cell growth. We report here that TGF beta1 arrested lung epithelial Mv1Lu cells at G1 phase of the cell cycle with acquisition of senescent phenotypes in the presence of 10% serum, whereas it gradually induced apoptosis with lower concentrations of serum. The senescent arrest was accompanied by prolonged generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and persistent disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim). We demonstrated that the sustained ROS overproduction was derived from mitochondrial respiratory defect via decreased complex IV activity and was involved in the arrest. Moreover, we verified that hepatocyte growth factor released Mv1Lu cells from the arrest by protecting mitochondrial respiration, thereby preventing both the DeltaPsim disruption and the ROS generation. Our present results suggest the TGF beta1-induced senescent arrest as another plausible mechanism to suppress cellular growth in vivo and provide a new biochemical association between the mitochondrial functional defects and the cytokine-induced senescent arrest, emphasizing the importance of maintenance of mitochondrial function in cellular protection from the arrest."
https://openalex.org/W1994115546,"In nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells (EpH4), transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ1) causes cell cycle arrest/apoptosis, but induces epitheliomesenchymal transition (EMT) in Ha-Ras-transformed EpH4 cells (EpRas). EMT is closely correlated with late-stage tumor progression and results in fibroblastic, migratory cells displaying a mesenchymal gene expression program (FibRas). EpRas and FibRas cells showed strongly increased cell substrate adhesion to fibronectin, collagens I/IV and laminin 1. Furthermore, Ras transformation caused enhanced or de-novo expression of the integrin subunits β1, α2 and α3, or α5 and α6, respectively, the latter subunits being even more strongly expressed in FibRas cells. Importantly, polarized EpRas cells expressed integrin subunits β1 and α6 at distinct (apical and lateral) membrane domains, while FibRas cells coexpressed these integrins and α5 at the entire plasma membrane. During EMT, EpRas cells formed an α5β1 complex and deposited its ligand fibronectin into the extracellular matrix. Function-blocking α5 antibodies attenuated migration, and caused massive apoptosis in EpRas cells undergoing TGFβ1-induced EMT in collagen gels, but failed to affect EpRas- or FibRas-derived structures. We conclude that functional α5β1 integrin is centrally implicated in EMT induction. Importantly, FibRas cells also failed to deposit the α6β4 ligand laminin 5, suggesting that α6β4 is no longer functional after EMT and replaced by mesenchymal integrins such as α5β1."
https://openalex.org/W2052246500,"The detrimental effect of severe hypoxia (SH) on neurons can be mitigated by hypoxic preconditioning (HPC), but the molecular mechanisms involved remain unclear, and an understanding of these may provide novel solutions for hypoxic/ischemic disorders (e.g. stroke). Here, we show that the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), an oxygen-sensitive membrane protein, mediates the HPC protection through specific signaling pathways. Although SH caused a decrease in DOR expression and neuronal injury, HPC induced an increase in DOR mRNA and protein levels and reversed the reduction in levels of the endogenous DOR peptide, leucine enkephalin, normally seen during SH, thus protecting the neurons from SH insult. The HPC-induced protection could be blocked by DOR antagonists. The DOR-mediated HPC protection depended on an increase in ERK and Bcl 2 activity, which counteracted the SH-induced increase in p38 MAPK activities and cytochrome c release. The cross-talk between ERK and p38 MAPKs displays a “yinyang” antagonism under the control of the DOR-G protein-protein kinase C pathway.

Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of HPC neuroprotection (i.e. the intracellular up-regulation of DOR-regulated survival signals). Neuronal death as a result of neuronal injury following hypoxic/ischemic insults, such as stroke, is an irreversible process that leads to long term neurological deficit. The prevention of neuronal injury is therefore critical in rescuing the brain from neurological disaster. However, clinical strategies that may help mitigate the effects of hypoxic/ischemic injury are still very limited. One strategy that has been shown to provide effective protection from harmful stress is known as preconditioning. This involves transient, but sublethal, exposure to a stress, resulting in enhanced cellular resistance to subsequent severe stress. It was initially demonstrated in the heart (1Murry C.E. Jennings R.B. Reimer K.A. Circulation. 1986; 74: 1124-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (6943) Google Scholar) and subsequently found to work in other organ beds (2Raeburn C.D. Cleveland J Jr C. Zimmerman M.A. Harken A.H. Arch. Surg. 2001; 136: 1263-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The effects of preconditioning have been widely studied in the whole brain (3Kitagawa K.

Brain Res. 1999; 827: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, a recent study failed to show neuronal protection with HPC treatment (11Meloni B.P. Majda B.T. Knuckey N.W. Brain Res. 2002; 928: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), suggesting that the neuronal response to preconditioning may vary depending on neuronal situation and involve complex mechanisms. These molecular mechanisms remain unclear, especially with regard to intracellular signal transduction. In this study, we demonstrated that, in neurons in culture, HPC-induced neuroprotection is dependent on specific factors and that the effect is mediated by intracellular up-regulation of δ-opioid receptor (DOR)-regulated survival signals, which suppress the increased activity of intracellular death signals during severe hypoxia (SH). DOR is a guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptor that is widely distributed in different mammalian cells (12Satoh M. Minami M. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 68: 343-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the regulation of opiate-induced analgesia and opioid dependence (13Quock R.M. Burkey T.H. Varga E. Hosohata Y. Hosohata K. Cowell S.M. Slate C.A. Ehlert F.J. Roeske W.R. Yamamura H.I. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 503-532PubMed Google Scholar), DOR may be an important mediator in the energy-conserving state of hibernation (14Su T.P. J. Biomed. Sci. 2000; 7: 195-199PubMed Google Scholar). Systemic administration of DOR agonists increases the survival time of mice exposed to subsequent hypoxic challenge (15Mayfield K.P. D'Alecy L.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 683-688PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mayfield K.P. D'Alecy L.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 268: 74-77PubMed Google Scholar). However, the targeted tissue and the underlying mechanisms are unknown, because the systemic distribution of DOR agonists may trigger cell protection in nonneuronal organs of the body (17Benedict P.E. Benedict M.B. Su T.P. Bolling S.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: II357-II360Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Tubbs R.J. Porcaro W.A. Lee W.J. Blehar D.J. Carraway R.E. Przyklenk K. Dickson E.W. Acad. Emerg. Med. 2002; 9: 555-560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data from our and other laboratories show that DOR activation is neuroprotective and predisposes neurons to survive under severe stress, such as glutamate-, hypoxia-, or serum deprivation-induced cell injury (19Zhang J. Gibney G.T. Zhao P. Xia Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1225-C1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Haddad G.G. Xia Y. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 21Hayashi T. Tsao L.I. Su T.P. Synapse. 2002; 43: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Moreover, in cortical neurons, we found that DOR inactivation by administration of a specific DOR antagonist causes cell death and further augments neuronal injury during SH, suggesting a crucial role of DOR in maintaining neuronal survival (20Zhang J. Haddad G.G. Xia Y. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that DOR density is much higher in turtle brain than in rat brain (22Xia Y. Haddad G.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and that turtle neurons are much more tolerant than rat neurons of hypoxic stress (23Xia Y. Jiang C. Haddad G.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: R595-R603PubMed Google Scholar). These observations prompted us to examine the possibility that DOR expression may be a critical determinant of neuronal survival during stress. Based on our previous work, we tested the hypothesis that HPC up-regulates DOR expression and enhances DOR-initiated survival signals, thus protecting neurons from subsequent severe stress. Because it is impractical to analyze molecular mechanisms by administering multiple drugs to live animals, we performed this study on neurons in culture and specifically focused on cortical neurons, since we have previously shown that the cortex has the highest DOR density (22Xia Y. Haddad G.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Xia Y. Haddad G.G. Brain Res. 1991; 549: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Primary Culture of Rat Cortical Neurons—Cortical neurons were isolated from embryonic Sprague-Dawley rats (embryonic days 16 and 17) as described previously (19Zhang J. Gibney G.T. Zhao P. Xia Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1225-C1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Haddad G.G. Xia Y. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). All animal treatments were performed according to the guidelines of the Animal Care Committee of Yale University School of Medicine, which is approved by the American Association for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. In brief, after anesthetizing the pregnant dam with halothane, the embryonic rats were removed and immediately rinsed in neurobasal medium (Invitrogen). Under a dissecting microscope, the embryonic brain cortex was carefully removed, soaked in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4), containing 0.6% glucose, collected by centrifugation, and treated with trypsin (Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37 °C. After neutralizing the trypsin with trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen) for 5 min, a cell suspension was prepared by repeated passage through a pipette and filtration through an 80-μm nylon mesh. It was then diluted with neurobasal medium containing B-27 (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm glutamine (Sigma), 25 μm glutamate (Sigma), and 100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (both from Invitrogen). The cells were counted by staining with trypan blue (Invitrogen), diluted to a density of 106 cells/ml in the same medium, and plated onto poly-d-lysine-precoated dishes. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in 21% O2 and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator for 8 days in vitro (DIV), at which time DOR protein expression reached a plateau (see “Results”). Hypoxic Preconditioning and Severe Prolonged Hypoxia—On DIV 8, the cultured neurons were divided into different groups. For HPC treatment, the culture was placed in a 5% O2 and 5% CO2 environment in an incubator for 3, 6, or 9 h. For SH treatment, the cultures were exposed to 1% oxygen for 5 days, unless stated otherwise. For HPC plus SH treatment, cells were treated with HPC for the indicated time, followed by SH treatment 24 h later (10Tauskela J.S. Chakravarthy B.R. Murray C.L. Wang Y. Comas T. Hogan M. Hakim A. Morley P. Brain Res. 1999; 827: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Drug Treatments—All drugs were added directly to the culture medium at the appropriate concentration immediately before HPC and again on day 3. The specific DOR blocker, naltrindole (RBI, St. Louis, MO), was used to block DOR function during HPC. The phosphorylated MAPKs, p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK, were blocked, respectively, using the specific inhibitors, SB202190 (20 μm; Tocris, Ellisville, MO), SP600125 (0.5 μm; Tocris), or U0126 (5 μm; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) as described previously (25Davies S.P. Reddy H. Caivano M. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 95-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (3910) Google Scholar). To examine the signaling molecules involved between the DOR signal and MAPKs, we also used pertussis toxin (100 ng ml–1; Sigma) to block pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein function. Calphostin C (0.1 μm, LC Laboratories, MA) or H89 (N-[2-((p-bromocinnamyl)amino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride) (0.5 μm; Calbiochem) was used to specifically inhibit intracellular PKC or PKA activity, as previously reported (10Tauskela J.S. Chakravarthy B.R. Murray C.L. Wang Y. Comas T. Hogan M. Hakim A. Morley P. Brain Res. 1999; 827: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). LDH Assay—The assay kit was obtained from Sigma (228-UV) and used as described previously (20Zhang J. Haddad G.G. Xia Y. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The advantage of this method is that it allows cell viability to be continuously monitored. In brief, a sample of the culture medium was centrifuged to remove detached cells, and then 100 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of prewarmed assay reagent at 30 °C for 30 s, and the absorbance at 340 nm was read at 30-s intervals for 2 min on a Beckman spectrophotometer (DU-640; Fullerton, CA). The change in absorbance was then expressed as a concentration in units/liter as described in the kit. Measurement of Cytoplasmic Histone-associated DNA Fragment— We used a cell death detection enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science) to perform the photometric measurement of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragment (mono- and polynucleosomes) after inducing cell death. Following the manufacturer's instructions, the neuronal cells were collected and lysed, and then, after centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant (cytoplasmic fraction) was carefully transferred to another tube and diluted 10-fold. For a positive control, three independent neuronal cultures were treated for 24 h with 1, 3, or 10 μm camptothecin (Tocris) to induce cell death. One hundred microliters of the diluted sample mixture was added to a microtiter plate precoated with anti-histone antibody, which was then incubated at room temperature for 2 h. After washing, peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibodies were added for 1.5 h at room temperature to react with the DNA in the bound nucleosome. The amount of bound peroxidase was quantified photometrically with 2,2′-azino-di-3-benzthiazoline sulfonate at 405 nm after washing. The extent of cell death was expressed as an enrichment factor calculated as the ratio of the absorbance of the sample (containing dying/dead neurons) to that of the corresponding control neurons. Estimation of Cell Viability—Neuronal viability was estimated using a staining kit (L-3224; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as described previously (20Zhang J. Haddad G.G. Xia Y. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In brief, a mixture of calcein AM and ethidium homodimer-1 was added to the neurons. Live neurons take up the cell-permeant calcein AM and hydrolyze it with an intracellular esterase to generate a cleavage product of calcein with a green fluorescence. Ethidium homodimer-1 enters injured or dead neurons with damaged plasma membrane and binds to nucleic acids, giving an enhanced red fluorescence. The results were examined using a fluorescence microscopy system (Zeiss Axiovert 25, Sony Progressive 3CCD and camera adapter CMA-D2) with blue excitation at 488/515 nm and green excitation at 514/550 nm. Immunoblots—After removing the culture medium, the neuronal cells were washed twice with PBS and then suspended in PBS containing a protease inhibitor mixture (1 μm pepstatin, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm leupeptin, and 1 mm EDTA; Roche Applied Science) followed by homogenization with a pellet pestle (Kontes, Vineland, NJ). All procedures were performed on ice as described previously (26Ma M.C. Huang H.S. Chen C.F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 1008-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The mixture was lysed by freeze-thawing three times and then centrifuged at 620 × g for 5 min to remove cellular debris, and samples of the supernatant were subjected to electrophoresis. For cytochrome c immunoblots to measure release from the mitochondria into the cytosol, the supernatant was further centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min to prepare the cytosolic fraction. The protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit (Hercules, CA). Protein samples (15–30 μg) were separated on a 7–15% polyacrylamide gradient gel under denaturing conditions, and electrophoretically transferred to either a nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) or polyvinylidene difluoride (Amersham Biosciences) membrane. The nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% skim milk or 1% bovine serum albumin (American Bioanalytical, Natick, MA) in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with different primary antibodies diluted in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin; the antibodies and dilutions were goat antibodies against DOR (1:100) or actin (1:250), mouse antisera against Bcl 2 (B cell lymphoma protein-2) (1:200), cytochrome c (1:200), or pJNK (1:500) (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit antisera against pp38, pERK, p38 MAPK, JNK, or ERK (1:500) (all from Cell Signaling). After washing, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti-mouse IgM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:400 in 3% skim milk and washed, and the bound antibody was visualized using a chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). The densities of the bands were measured by densitometry using an image analysis system (Amersham Biosciences). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR to Detect DOR mRNA Expression—Total cellular RNA in the cultured neurons was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), as described in the manufacturer's protocol. The RNA pellet was washed twice with 75% ethanol, dried, and resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated water. cDNA was synthesized at 42 °C for 47 min using 5 μg of the total RNA sample, 0.5 μg of poly(dT)15 oligonucleotide primer (Invitrogen), and 200 units of reverse transcriptase (Moloney murine leukemia virus; Promega, Madison, WI) in a final volume of 20 μl. DOR and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNAs were amplified using specific primers designed as previously described (27Buzas B. Cox B.M. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The sequences for DOR were 5′-GCT GTG CTC TCC ATT GAC TAC-3′ and 5′-GAT GTC CAC CAG CGT CCA GAC-3′ (transcript product of 480 bases), and those for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-TTA GCA CCC CTG GCC AAG G-3′ and 5′-CTT ACT CCT TGG AGG CCA TG-3′ (transcript product of 535 bases). The reverse transcription product (2.5 μl) was amplified with a mixture of primers and 2.5 units of REDTag DNA polymerase (Sigma) for 30 cycles under conditions of 1 min at 95 °C for denaturation, 50 s at 58 °C for annealing, and 1 min at 72 °C for extension. The reaction products were electrophoresed through a 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The densities of the bands were measured using an image analytic system (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). DOR mRNA levels were expressed as the ratio of the DOR and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase PCR products. Measurement of Leucine Enkephalin—The intraneuronal content of leucine enkephalin (LE) and the amount of LE release into the culture medium were determined using an enzyme-linked immunoassay kit from Phoenix Pharmaceuticals (Belmont, CA). The culture medium was collected by aspiration, and the neurons in the dish were scraped off after three washes with PBS. LE in both the medium and the cells was measured using the peptide extraction and assay procedures described by the kit manufacturer. First, 1% trifluoroacetic acid was added to the samples, which were then mixed thoroughly and centrifuged. The supernatant was applied to a Sep C18 column equilibrated with 60% acetonitrile in 1% trifluoroacetic acid, and LE was eluted from the column using the same solution, which was then removed by drying under nitrogen. The samples were reconstituted in 0.5 ml of assay buffer. Duplicate samples and standards were mixed with biotinylated anti-LE antibody in a 96-well plate. The plate was then incubated for 2.5 h at room temperature. After five washes with the buffer, streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was added, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After color development using peroxidase substrate, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 n HCl, and the optical density of the wells was read at 450 nm. The values of LE are expressed as ng (mg of protein)–1. Statistics—All experiments were performed on 3–6 (n value in the text) independent batches of neuronal cultures prepared on separate days. The data throughout are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using the Newman-Keuls test of analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. A significance level of 5% was used. HPC-induced Neuroprotection Is Dependent on the Duration of Preconditioning—Neuronal responses to hypoxia depend greatly on the duration of the stress (27Buzas B. Cox B.M. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Since results are inconsistent regarding HPC-induced protection (10Tauskela J.S. Chakravarthy B.R. Murray C.L. Wang Y. Comas T. Hogan M. Hakim A. Morley P. Brain Res. 1999; 827: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 11Meloni B.P. Majda B.T. Knuckey N.W. Brain Res. 2002; 928: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we asked whether the effects of HPC depend on the duration of treatment by subjecting cortical neurons to different durations of HPC. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1A, when neuronal cells were exposed to prolonged SH (1% oxygen), LDH leakage, a reliable index of neuronal injury (19Zhang J. Gibney G.T. Zhao P. Xia Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C1225-C1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Zhang J. Haddad G.G. Xia Y. Brain Res. 2000; 885: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), increased to 27 ± 4, 199 ± 15, and 353 ± 34% after 1, 3, and 5 days of SH as compared with control levels at the same neuronal age (all p < 0.01 as compared with the control). In neurons preconditioned with mild hypoxia (5% oxygen) for 6 h (HPC6 in Fig. 1) before SH, injury was attenuated, as shown by a significant reduction in LDH release as compared with SH alone (102 ± 13 and 106 ± 18% over the control, respectively, after 3 and 5 days of SH, both p < 0.001 as compared with the SH group without HPC). No appreciable neuroprotection was seen with 3 h of HPC (HPC3) (LDH release increase to 165 ± 21 and 296 ± 42%, respectively, over control after 3 and 5 days of SH; p > 0.05 compared with SH alone). In addition, a longer period of treatment (HPC9) did not result in a further reduction in LDH release (p > 0.05 as compared with the 6 h HPC group). We therefore chose the 6-h HPC regimen for induction of neuroprotection in subsequent experiments. DOR Function Is Critical for HPC-induced Neuroprotection—The DOR is highly expressed in the cortex (22Xia Y. Haddad G.G. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 202-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Xia Y. Haddad G.G. Brain Res. 1991; 549: 181-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and is homogeneously expressed in cortical neurons in culture (data not shown). To examine the role of the DOR in HPC-mediated neuroprotection, a specific DOR blocker, naltrindole, was used to determine whether DOR inactivation affected HPC-induced protection. Under basal conditions and without HPC, treatment with 0.01 or 0.1 μm naltrindole alone for 5 days did not result in neuronal toxicity, whereas treatment with a higher concentration (1.0 μm) led to a significant increase in LDH release (98 ± 12% over the control level, n = 6, p < 0.05). As shown in the lower panel of Fig. 1A, 0.01–1.0 μm naltrindole applied to HPC-treated neurons largely attenuated the HPC-induced protection. For example, with 0.1 μm naltrindole, the level of LDH release increased by 178 ± 12 or 318 ± 39% over the control after 3 or 5 days of SH, respectively, which was similar to that of SH neurons without HPC treatment (p > 0.05 compared with SH alone). To further confirm the HPC-induced protection, we assessed DNA breakdown as an index of neuronal damage, since DNA degradation has been suggested to occur before plasma membrane breakdown (28Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1B, when quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the cytoplasmic levels of the DNA degradation product, the nucleosome, SH significantly increased nucleosome levels, and HPC attenuated this increase, consistent with the results of the LDH assay. HPC did not affect nucleosome levels in basal conditions under normoxia. The most striking observation is that DOR blocker (naltrindole) reversed the protective effect of HPC on the SH neurons, as evidenced by an increase in the level of nucleosome. Morphological examination of cell viability provided additional evidence for the protective effect of HPC in our model. As shown in Fig. 1C, SH caused severe neuronal death and loss of connection between neurons, whereas few dead cells were seen in the normoxic control. HPC alone did not significantly affect neuronal viability but preserved the viability of neurons exposed to SH, and this effect was blocked by naltrindole. DOR Expression Is Oxygen-sensitive and Is Up-regulated after HPC—We then asked whether DOR expression changed in response to SH with or without HPC. On Western blots, the molecular weight of the DOR band, which could be down-regulated by DOR small interfering RNA (data not shown), was about 46 kDa, consistent with a previous report (29Hislop J.N. Marley A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22522-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Under base-line conditions, DOR expression reached a plateau after DIV 8 (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, exposure to SH for 3 or 5 days was associated with a 24 ± 4 or 51 ± 8% decrease, respectively, in DOR levels (p < 0.01). As shown in Fig. 2C, HPC for 6 or 9 h resulted in marked up-regulation of DOR expression in normoxic neurons (for 6 h HPC, a 40 ± 9 and 54 ± 7% increase, respectively, over the control at 5 days, p < 0.001). When HPC-treated neurons were exposed to SH, their DOR levels were much higher than that in cells treated with SH alone. For instance, DOR levels were 28 ± 2to39 ± 2% higher in neurons exposed to 6 or 9 h of HPC plus SH than in untreated controls. The up-regulation of DOR expression correlated well with the neuroprotective effect in cortical neurons with HPC treatment (Fig. 1A). In contrast, 3-h HPC treatment had no significant effect on DOR expression during normoxia or after SH, consistent with the lack of neuroprotection described above (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 2D, DOR expression in either HPC- or SH-treated cells was not affected by pretreatment with 0.01–1.0 μm naltrindole, indicating that the blocking effect of naltrindole on HPC protection was due to an effect on DOR function, not receptor expression. We then determined whether HPC- and/or SH-induced changes in DOR protein levels were associated with changes in DOR mRNA levels. Fig. 2E shows that, compared with agematched neurons under normoxia, DOR mRNA levels were significantly decreased after 3 or 5 days of SH to 46 ± 11 and 24 ± 8% of control levels, respectively (p < 0.05). HPC treatment partially reversed the SH-induced decrease in DOR mRNA levels to 72 ± 16 and 62 ± 11% of control levels after 3 and 5 days of SH, respectively (p < 0.01 compared with SH alone). These data suggest that HPC regulates DOR expression in cortical neurons not only at the protein level, but also at the mRNA level. HPC Preve"
https://openalex.org/W1976122932,"Secretory clusterin protein (sCLU) is a general genotoxic stress-induced, pro-survival gene product implicated in aging, obesity, heart disease, and cancer. However, the regulatory signal transduction processes that control sCLU expression remain undefined. Here, we report that induction of sCLU is delayed, peaking 72 h after low doses of ionizing radiation, and is dependent on the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 as well as phosphorylation-dependent activation of its receptor (IGF-1 and IGF-1R, respectively). Activated IGF-1R then stimulates the downstream Src-Mek-Erk signal transduction cascade to ultimately transactivate the early growth response-1 (Egr-1) transcription factor, required for sCLU expression. Thus, ionizing radiation exposure causes stress-induced activation of IGF-1R-Src-Mek-Erk-Egr-1 signaling that regulates the sCLU pro-survival cascade pathway, important for radiation resistance in cancer therapy."

Most P450 enzymes have fixed ratios of their various activities, but the ratio of these two activities of P450c17 is regulated post-translationally. We have shown that serine phosphorylation of P450c17 and the allosteric action of cytochrome b5 increase 17,20 lyase activity, but it has not been apparent whether these two post-translational mechanisms interact. Using purified enzyme systems, we now show that the actions of cytochrome b5 are independent of the state of P450c17 phosphorylation.

Increasing P450c17 phosphorylation could compensate for this reduced activity. When expressed in bacteria, human P450c17 required either cytochrome b5 or phosphorylation for 17,20 lyase activity. The combination of cytochrome b5 and phosphorylation was not additive.

In human adrenal steroidogenesis, P450c17 is the qualitative regulator that determines the class of steroids synthesized in different cell types: in its absence, mineralocorticoids are produced; if only its 17α-hydroxylase activity is present, glucocorticoids are produced; if both its 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities are present, precursors of sex steroids are produced (8.Miller W.L. Auchus R.J. Geller D.H. Steroids. 1997; 62: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The single human CYP17 gene (9.Picado-Leonard J. Miller W.L.

However, there are species-specific differences in these activities, especially concerning the 17,20 lyase reaction: the rodent and guinea pig enzymes use both 17OH-Preg and 17OH-Prog as substrates, the bovine enzyme mainly uses 17OH-Prog, and the human enzyme uses 17OH-Preg almost exclusively (1.Nakajin S.

Similar to all other microsomal forms of cytochrome P450, the catalytic activities of P450c17 require electron donation from NADPH through the intermediacy of a membrane-bound flavoprotein termed P450 oxidoreductase (POR) (15.Lu A.Y.

All cytochrome P450 enzymes catalyze multiple reactions, but the ratios of these multiple reactions are determined primarily by substrate concentrations. By contrast, P450c17 appears to be unique in that the ratio of its two principal activities is developmentally regulated. Human serum concentrations of cortisol, an index of 17α-hydroxylase activity, remain constant as a function of age, but concentrations of DHEA, an index of 17,20 lyase activity, rise over 100-fold during adrenarche (18.Orentreich N. Brind J.L. Rizer R.L. Vogelman J.H. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The ratio of 17,20 lyase activity to 17α-hydroxylase activity can be regulated by three distinct post-translational mechanisms. First, the presence of high molar ratios of POR to P450c17 favor the 17,20 lyase reaction (14.Lin D. Black S.M. Nagahama Y. Miller W.L.

Third, serine/threonine phosphorylation of P450c17 increases 17,20 lyase activity but does not affect 17α-hydroxylase activity (28.Zhang L.H. Rodriguez H. Ohno S. Miller W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In some P450-mediated drug metabolism reactions, cytochrome b5 appears to act as an alternative electron donor that can substitute for POR in the donation of second electron in the P450 cycle (30.Yamazaki H.

Auchus R.J. Mendonca B.B. Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); when cytochrome b5 is added, 17,20 lyase activity is partially restored, increasing the Vmax but not influencing the Km of the mutants (27.Geller D.H. Auchus R.J. Miller W.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), thus confirming the allosteric action of cytochrome b5. The mechanism by which P450c17 phosphorylation augments 17,20 lyase activity is not known, nor is it known whether the state of P450c17 phosphorylation influences the allosteric action of cytochrome b5. Using purified, catalytically active, bacterially-expressed human P450c17, POR, and b5 in vitro and RNA interference knockdown of cytochrome b5 in human adrenal NCI-H295A cells, we now show that these two mechanisms of augmenting 17,20 lyase activity function independently.

Virology. 1997; 233: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) cells were grown as described. NCI-H295A cells from several plates were collected by scraping, washed with chilled phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), suspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate containing 150 mm KCl, and lysed by sonication. Unbroken cells and mitochondria were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min, and microsomes were collected by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min in a Beckman T-100 rotor. Microsomes were resuspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 20% glycerol. Cytochrome b5 Expression Analysis—Expression of cytochrome b5 in various cell lines was analyzed by RT-PCR using GAPDH as control. The primer sequences used were for cytochrome b5: sense, 5′-ATGGCAGAGCAGTCGGACGA-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCAGTCCTCTGCCATGTATAG-3′; for OMb5: sense, 5′-ATGGCGACTGCGGAAGCTA-3′ and antisense, 5′-TCAGGAGGATTTGCTTTCCGA-3′; for GAPDH: sense, 5′-GTATCGTGGAAGGACTCAT-3′ and antisense, 5′-TACTCCTTGGTGGCCATGT-3′. All PCR reactions were performed for 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C 45s followed by 1 cycle of 72 °C for 10 min, and products were separated on 10% Tris borate/EDTA acrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide and visualized on a Kodak EDS 290 gel documentation system. Expression and Purification of Human P450c17—Human P450c17 was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (39.Imai T. Globerman H. Gertner J.M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19681-19689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid pCWH17-mod(His)4 containing the cDNA for N-terminally modified human P450c17 (40.Brock B.J. Waterman M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1598-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) was transformed into E. coli JM109, colonies were selected on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, and a single colony was grown to A600 of 0.4–0.6 in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. From this culture, 1 ml of bacteria were seeded into terrific broth containing 40 μm FeCl3,4 μm ZnCl2,2 μm CoCl2, 2 μm Na2MoO4, 2 μm CaCl2, 2 μm CuCl2, 2 μm H3BO3, and 10% v/v potassium phosphate solution (0.17 m KH2PO4, 0.72 m K2HPO4, pH 7.4) and 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and grown at 30 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. At A600 of 0.5–0.7, 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) and 0.4 mm δ-amino levulinic acid were added, and the culture was shaken at 125 rpm for 36 h at 30 °C. The bacteria were then chilled on ice, pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8 containing 500 mm sucrose and 0.5 mm EDTA (10 ml/g of pellet). Lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) was added to the bacterial suspension, and the cells were kept on ice for 30 min with occasional stirring. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate pH 7.6 containing 6 mm magnesium acetate, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The resulting spheroplasts were sonicated on ice with 15–20 cycles of 20-s pulses followed by 30 s cooling at 50% power using a Fisher scientific 550 sonicator with a microprobe. The lysate was cleared of unbroken cells and debris by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and membranes were pelleted by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman T-100 rotor at 100,000 × g for 90 min. The resultant pellet containing human P450c17 was used for enzyme assays and purification of P450c17; cytochrome P450 content was measured by reduced carbon monoxide binding spectra (41.Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). P450c17 was purified from the E. coli membranes by solubilization in 0.7% Triton X-114 followed by chromatography on Ni-NTA and hydrophobic interaction chromatography as described (29.Pandey A.V. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 39.Imai T. Globerman H. Gertner J.M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19681-19689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified P450c17 was resuspended in 100 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol and 0.1% Triton X-100. Phosphatase Treatment of Bacterially Expressed Human P450c17— Purified preparations of P450c17 (5 μg) were treated with 5 units of alkaline phosphatase or protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) for 15 min at 25 °C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF, and/or 50 μm okadaic acid (Calbiochem) in the case of protein PP2A. P450c17 treated with phosphatases was repurified on a Ni-NTA spin column (Amersham Biosciences) and used for enzyme assays. The amount of phosphate released into the supernatant was monitored by malachite green reaction (BioMol Laboratories). Expression and Purification of Human POR—Human POR was expressed in bacteria by transforming E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells with a pET22b vector (Novagen) containing human POR cDNA (17.Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W. Okuhara K. Verge C.F. Jabs E.W. Mendonca B.B. Fujieda K. Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Freshly transformed E. coli were selected on a LB agar plate with 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and a single colony was seeded into LB media containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 28 °C to A600 of about 0.5. From this culture, 1 ml of bacteria were seeded into 150 ml of terrific broth supplemented with 40 μm FeCl3, 4 μm ZnCl2, 2 μm CoCl2, 2 μm Na2MoO4, 2 μm CaCl2, 2 μm CuCl2, 2 μm H3BO3, and 10% v/v potassium phosphate solution (0.17 m KH2PO4, 0.72 m K2HPO4, pH 7.4), 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol and grown at 30 °C to A600 of 0.4–0.7, 0.4 mm IPTG and 0.1 mg/ml riboflavin were added, and the bacteria were shaken at 125 rpm for another 16 h before harvesting by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The bacteria were then washed with PBS, treated with lysozyme (0.1 mg/ml) and EDTA (0.1 mm, pH 8.0), and membranes were prepared as described for P450c17. Membranes were dissolved in 100 mm phosphate buffer containing 100 mm NaCl, 1.5% Triton X-100 and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and POR was purified by affinity chromatography on 2′-5′ ADP-agarose as described (42.Smith G.C. Tew D.G. Wolf C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8710-8714Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of this POR preparation was assessed by assays using either cytochrome c or NADPH as substrates as described (17.Flück C.E. Tajima T. Pandey A.V. Arlt W. Okuhara K. Verge C.F. Jabs E.W. Mendonca B.B. Fujieda K. Miller W.L. Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 228-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of Cytochrome b5—Human cytochrome b5 was prepared in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with plasmid pLW01b5 containing the cDNA for human cytochrome b5 and selected over several cycles, as described (43.Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). A single colony of transformed E. coli was inoculated into LB media containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin, grown to an A260 of 0.5–0.7, and IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mm. Cell density was measured every 30 min; when the A600 nm started to rise again (90–180-min postinduction), 100 μl of cells diluted 1:50 were plated on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin and 0.4 mm IPTG and allowed to grow overnight at 37 °C. A single colony was grown the next day and the process of induction and selection with carbenicillin and IPTG was repeated three more times. After four cycles of selection, the E. coli were transformed with plasmid pLysS Rare, which encodes lysozyme and six rare tRNAs that assist the expression of mammalian proteins by complementing the codon bias of E. coli. The resultant E. coli were used for expression of cytochrome b5. Expression and purification was performed as described previously (44.Mulrooney S.B. Waskell L. Protein. Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Suppression of Cytochrome b5 by Short Hairpin RNA (shRNA) in NCI-H295A Cells—NCI-H295A cells were transfected with the retroviral vector pSUPERretro (45.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar, 46.Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 243-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar) expressing shRNA targeted against both types 1 and 2 human cytochrome b5. The pSUPERretro vector was digested with BglI and HindIII and ligated to the 64-mer oligonucleotide duplexes (sense 5′-GATCCCCCAAGCTGGAGGTGACGCTATTCAAGAGATAGCGTCACCTCCAGCTTGTTTTTGGAAA-3′and antisense 3′-GGGGTTCGACCTCCACTGCGATAAGTTCTCTATCGCAGTGGAGGTCGAACAAAAACCTTTTCGA-5′) encoding small interfering RNA (siRNA) against cytochrome b5 and a 9-nucleotide loop region. The recombinant plasmid was purified from bacterial cultures and digested with EcoRI and HindIII to check the inserts. Purified plasmid was transformed into NCI-H295A, and cells containing the virus were selected by puromycin and used for cytochrome b5 measurement and P450c17 enzyme assays. Measurement of Cytochrome b5 Protein and mRNA—The cytochrome b5 content of NCI-H295A cells was measured by differential spectroscopy (47.Strittmatter P. Velick S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 221: 253-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were homogenized in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4) containing 150 mm KCl; the homogenate was cleared by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 10 min, placed into reference and sample cuvettes and baseline spectra were recorded between 400 and 500 nm at a speed of 120 nm/min. Cytochrome b5 in the sample cuvette was reduced with 1 mg sodium dithionite, and the spectra were recorded again. Cytochrome b5 content was estimated by the difference in absorbance at 423 and 490 nm using a millimolar extinction coefficient of 181 mmol cm–1 (47.Strittmatter P. Velick S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 221: 253-264Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytochrome b5 mRNA was estimated by RT-PCR. In Vitro Phosphorylation of P450c17—To prepare a cytoplasmic fraction enriched for the kinases that phosphorylate P450c17 and devoid of phosphatase activity, NCI-H295A cells were lysed, and cytosol was passed over a γ-ATP-Sepharose column (Upstate Biotechnologies); the column was washed with NAD, NADP, ADP, and AMP, and ATP-binding proteins were eluted with 10 mm ATP (29.Pandey A.V. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Kinase activity was checked by phosphorylation of microsomes or purified bacterially expressed recombinant human P450c17 by incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP. Purified P450c17 was phosphorylated in vitro using 6 μg of purified P450c17 incubated with 10 μg of kinase fraction in the presence of 50 mm HEPES buffer, 10 mm ATP, 60 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm okadaic acid at 25 °C for 30 min and phosphorylated P450c17 was purified on mini Ni-NTA columns (29.Pandey A.V. Mellon S.H. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2837-2844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). P450c17 Enzyme Assays—The 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20 lyase activities of P450c17 were assayed as described (13.Auchus R.J. Lee T.C. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3158-3165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 39.Imai T. Globerman H. Gertner J.M. Kagawa N. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19681-19689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified P450c17 (10 pmol) and POR (20 pmol) were incubated with 100 mm potassium phosphate, 6 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 20% glycerol, 20 μg phosphatidylcholine, 3 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 0.1 mm glucose-6-phosphate and radiolabeled substrate ([14C]progesterone for hydroxylase assay and [3H]17OH-Preg for lyase assay) with or without 10 pmol of cytochrome b5 for 5 min at 25 °C in a total volume of 200 μl. The reaction was started by addition of 20 μl of 10 mm NADPH and incubations at 37 °C were carried out for various times and stopped by adding ethyl acetate/iso-octane (3:1) to extract the steroids. Steroids from different reactions were spotted on silica gel 60 F-254 thin layer chromatography plates (Merck) and developed with ethyl acetate/chloroform (3:1) (4.Lin D. Harikrishna J.A. Moore C.C.D. Jones K.L. Miller W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15992-15998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plates were dried, and steroids were quantitated by autoradiography on a Storm 860 phosphorimager using Image Quant software. Kinetic behavior was approximated as a Michaelis-Menten system. Curve fitting and calculations of maximum velocity (Vmax) and apparent Michaelis constant (Km) values were performed using LEONORA (48.Cornish-Bowden A. Analysis of Enzyme Kinetic Data. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995Google Scholar). Isoforms of Cytochrome b5 in NCI-H295A Cells—Three forms of cytochrome b5 have been described: the 98-amino acid soluble and 134-amino acid microsomal form are encoded by one gene (49.Giordano S.J. Steggles A.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 50.Giordano S.J. Yoo M. Ward D.C. Bhatt M. Overhauser J. Steggles A.W. Hum. Genet. 1993; 92: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) and a 146-amino acid form associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMb5) is encoded by a second gene (51.Rivera M.

Benson D.R. Rivera M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9469-9483Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To identify the forms of cytochrome b5 found in NCI-H295A cells, we performed RT-PCR with two pairs of oligonucleotide primers that will amplify the three products of the two genes. In human liver HepG2 cells, the mRNAs for microsomal cytochrome b5 and for OMb5 were found in approximately equal amounts, but in human kidney HEK293, human placenta JEG-3 cells, and especially in human adrenal NCI-H295A cells, the mRNA for microsomal cytochrome b5 was much more abundant than the mRNA for OMb5 (Fig. 2A). The mRNA for the soluble form, generally associated with erythropoietic tissues, was not detected in the cell lines tested. As human P450c17 is a microsomal enzyme and as the mRNA for the microsomal form of cytochrome b5 was most abundant in adrenal cells, we focused attention on microsomal cytochrome b5. Knockdown of Cytochrome b5 in NCI-H295A Cells—To determine the effect of cytochrome b5 on the catalytic activities of P450c17 in steroidogenic cells, we used RNA interference to knock down cytochrome b5 mRNA in human adrenal NCI-H295A cells (Fig. 2B). An shRNA targeted against cytochrome b5 was transfected into human adrenal NCI-H295A cells, and cells were harvested 24, 48, 72, and 96 h later. Expression of this shRNA caused a gradual decrease in spectrally assayable cytochrome b5 over time: cytochrome b5 was reduced by 15% after 24 h, 65% after 48 h, and 85% after 72 h (Fig. 2C). Knockdown of cytochrome b5 had no effect on 17α-hydroxylase activity in NCI-H295A cells for up to 96 h (Fig. 2, D and E). There was no measurable change in the 17,20 lyase activity in the first 24 h, but 17,20 lyase activity was reduced 15% after 48 h and 30% after 72–96 h (Fig. 2, D and E). This decrease in 17,20 lyase activity was much less than the decrease in cytochrome b5 protein, suggesting that another factor was promoting 17,20 lyase activity. Increased Phosphorylation of P450c17 Counters the Effect of Reduced Cytochrome b5 on 17,20 Lyase Activity—Because reducing cytochrome b5 in intact cells had only a modest effect on 17,20 lyase activity, we sought to examine the potential interactions between the presence of cytochrome b5 and the phosphorylation of P450c17 on 17,20 lyase activity. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine phosphatases, specifically increases 17,20 lyase activity in NCI-H295A cells and increases P450c17 phosphorylation (29.Pandey A.V. Mellon S.H.

The structure reveals that LSL is hexameric, which was also shown by analytical ultracentrifugation. The monomeric protein (35 kDa) consists of two distinct modules: an N-terminal lectin module and a pore-forming module. The lectin module has a β-trefoil scaffold that bears structural similarities to those present in toxins known to interact with galactose-related carbohydrates such as the hemagglutinin component (HA1) of the progenitor toxin from Clostridium botulinum, abrin, and ricin. On the other hand, the C-terminal pore-forming module (composed of domains 2 and 3) exhibits three-dimensional structural resemblances with domains 3 and 4 of the β-pore-forming toxin aerolysin from the Gram-negative bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila, and domains 2 and 3 from the ϵ-toxin from Clostridium perfringens. This finding reveals the existence of common structural elements within the aerolysin-like family of toxins that could be directly involved in membrane-pore formation. The crystal structures of the complexes of LSL with lactose and N-acetyllactosamine reveal two dissacharide-binding sites per subunit and permits the identification of critical residues involved in sugar binding.

Recently, a novel toxic lectin from the parasitic mushroom Laetiporus sulphureus (LSL) 1The abbreviations used are: LSL, lectin from Laetiporus sulphureus; LSLa-D1, C-terminal deletion mutant of LSL; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; PFM, pore-forming module; HA1, hemagglutinin 1. 1The abbreviations used are: LSL, lectin from Laetiporus sulphureus; LSLa-D1, C-terminal deletion mutant of LSL; LacNAc, N-acetyllactosamine; PFM, pore-forming module; HA1, hemagglutinin 1. that shows strong hemagglutination and hemolytic activity has been characterized (1Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40455-40463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by binding carbohydrates as demonstrated by the correlation found between both processes in sugar inhibition assays, which reveals LacNAc (Galβ14GlcNAc) as a potent inhibitor. The N-terminal module of LSL is a carbohydrate recognition domain as deduced from the C-terminal deletion mutant of LSL, LSLa-D1, which shows hemagglutination, but not hemolytic activity. Conversely, the C-terminal module shows structural similarity to pore-forming bacterial toxins suggesting a similar mode of biological activity. In this sense, LSL-induced hemolysis proceeds through a mechanism involving the formation of ion-permeable membrane pores with a functional diameter smaller than 3.8 nm, as revealed by osmotic protection experiments (1Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40455-40463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). After pore formation, erythrocytes are ruptured by a colloidosmotic lysis mechanism. Thus, LSL appears to exhibit two functional modules: lectin and pore-forming. LSL is a noncovalent-linked oligomeric structure, in which the C-terminal domains play a crucial role as deduced by the monomeric and highly polar character of LSLa-D1. Here we report the crystal structure of the novel eukaryotic pore-forming toxin present in the parasitic mushroom L. sulphureus. The two-module structure of LSL described herein suggests the existence of mechanisms of evolution involving the association of discrete stable functional modules into a final modular protein with toxic character. Additionally, the three-dimensional similarity between LSL and aerolysin from the bacterium Aeromonas hydrophila (2Parker M.W. Buckley T. Postma J.P. Tucker A.D. Leonard K. Pattus F. Tsernoglou D. Nature. 1994; 367: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar) and also ϵ-toxin from Clostridium perfringens (3Cole A.R. Gibert M. Popoff M. Moss D.S. Titball R.W. Basak A.K. Nat. Struct.

Materials—Lactose (Galβ14Glc) was purchased from Sigma. LacNAc was synthesized and available from other studies. The lectin from the mushroom L. sulphureus was prepared as described by Tateno and Goldstein (1Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40455-40463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were performed at 10,500 and 12,500 × g at 20 °C, using a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge with an An-50Ti rotor and standard double sector centerpiece cells. Solvent density (1.005 mg/ml) and the partial specific volume of LSL (0.723) were calculated from the buffer composition (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, and 2 mm KH2PO4) and from the predicted amino acid composition, respectively, with SEDNTERP (5Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Biochemistry and Polymer Science, Royal Society of Chemistry, London1992Google Scholar). Data from sedimentation velocity and equilibrium experiments were analyzed using the programs Sedfit (6Schuck P. Biophys.

Data Collection and Processing—Initial diffraction data were collected on hexagonal LSL crystals obtained as previously described (8Mancheño J.M. Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. Hermoso J.A.

For derivatization, we soaked the crystals for 24 h in crystallization solution containing 20 mm K2Pt(CN)4. The crystals were then transferred to the cryoprotectant solution (soaking solution plus 30% (v/v) glycerol) for ∼5 s and flash-frozen in the cold nitrogen stream (100 K). All data were collected at beamline ID14-1 (λ = 0.934 Å) at the ESRF (Grenoble, France), using an ADSC Q4 CCD detector.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure of LSL with bound Lac (see below) was determined by the method of single isomorphous replacement using the anomalous scatter signal of a platinum derivative. The platinum atoms were located on both isomorphous and anomalous difference Patterson maps. Refinement of heavy atom parameters and phase calculations to 2.6-Å resolution were performed with SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Solvent flattening and histogram matching were performed with DM (9Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar) assuming a solvent content of 40%, i.e. two LSL molecules in the asymmetric unit, rendered a low-quality electron density map. On the contrary, the electron density map obtained considering one LSL molecule in the asymmetric unit (70% solvent content), was of excellent quality, and enabled the incorporation of a complete protein model using O (13Jones T.A. Zou J-Y. Cowtan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallog. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). Only two long loops in the C-terminal module did not show interpretable density. After refinement, only two regions of the atomic model, those comprising residues 180–186 and 258–263, are not defined in the electron density map. The initial model had a crystallographic R factor of 40% for all reflections in the resolution range of 50–2.6 Å. Structure refinement was performed using the programs CNS (14Brünger A.T.

The final model has an R factor of 22.7% and a free R factor of 27.9%, and included 312 amino acid residues, 1 Lac, 6 glycerols, and 77 solvent molecules. The structures of the LSL·LacNAc complexes were determined by the molecular replacement method with MOLREP (9Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19733) Google Scholar) using the structure of LSL as search model. The quality of the models were checked using the program PROCHECK (16Laskowski R. MacArthur M. Moss D. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Phasing and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I. Overall Description of the Structure—The monomeric LSL molecule consists of two different structural modules corresponding to the previously reported functional modules, lectin and pore-forming (Fig. 1). The lectin module (residues 3–150) has a globular structure, consisting of a β-trefoil with approximate dimensions 39 × 32 × 32 Å3. The structure of the complexes with Lac and LacNAc reveals two sugar binding sites. The pore-forming module (residues 151–314) consists of an elongated lobe with dimensions 72 × 23 × 23 Å3. This module can be effectively divided into two regions: domain 2 is formed by a twisted five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet together with a long amphipathic loop located in one face of the sheet, and domain 3 consisting of a β-sandwich. The N-terminal Lectin Module—The N-terminal module of LSL consists of a β-trefoil (Fig. 2), a characteristic fold previously described in other lectins (17McLachlan A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 133: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 19Hazes B. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1490-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). It is formed by a six-stranded anti-parallel β-barrel capped on one end by three two-stranded hairpins (strand pairs β2 and β3, β6 and β7, β10 and β11) (Fig. 2A). These last three hairpins, the hairpin triplet, arrange in a triangular array that gives rise to a pseudo 3-fold symmetry. The global structure of the β-trefoil is based on tandem repetition of a basic motif (called α, β, and γ, respectively) composed of four β-strands separated by three loops, the third one containing a single-turn 310 helix (Fig. 2B). In this regard, it has been previously suggested that the existence of a primordial galactose-binding peptide of ∼40 residues would be the ancestor of the basic motifs of the β-trefoil scaffold (20Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Analysis of the primary (Fig. 2C) and tertiary structure (Fig. 2D) of the three motifs reveals that in effect they are homologous with each other, but also reveal the existence of clear divergences. Thus, although pairwise sequence comparisons between motifs reveal identities around 20%, only four conserved residues are contributed by each motif (Fig. 2C); yet, despite the primary degeneration, the three-dimensional structure of the peptide backbone of the motifs is essentially conserved (Fig. 2D). Doubtless, the interplay between three-dimensional conservation and primary departures should provide the structural basis for the different sugar binding properties of each motif (see below). Structural comparison of the N-terminal module of LSL, with known folds using the DALI algorithm (21Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3556) Google Scholar), revealed a high homology with proteins known to interact with sugars, for example, the hemagglutinin component (HA1) of the progenitor toxin from Clostridium botulinum (22Inoue K.

Abstr. Papers (Annu. Meeting) 25, 90,Google Scholar) (1a8d, Z = 10.4). Perhaps, the most notable of the DALI results is the remarkable resemblance of the N-terminal module of LSL with sugar-binding domains of toxins that exert their cytotoxic action by binding glycoproteins; particularly, the hemagglutinin component (HA1), which has been shown to increase the toxicity of C. botulinum neurotoxin by binding to oligosaccharides lining the intestine (30Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Watanabe S. Yokota K. Hirai Y. Nagamachi E. Oguma K. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 3841-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Fujinaga Y. Inoue K. Nomura T. Sasaki J. Marvaud J.C. Popoff M.R. Kozaki S. Oguma K. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), or abrin and the closely related deadly plant toxin ricin (20Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D. Nature. 1987; 326: 624-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), which bind their target membranes through a β-trefoil motif. The emergence of this structural motif in toxins from diverse sources could suggest a mechanism of evolution involving the association of discrete stable functional modules into a final modular protein with toxic character. Sugar-binding Sites—Previous work demonstrated that Lac, LacNAc, and other galactose-related saccharides inhibited the hemagglutination and hemolytic activity of LSL (1Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40455-40463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The correlation between both processes indicates that sugar binding is involved in both molecular mechanisms. Because experiments of osmotic protection of erythrocytes showed that hemolysis results from the formation of discrete pores in the membranes, it can be inferred that the molecular mechanism of pore formation by LSL involves the initial, specific recognition of carbohydrates. The x-ray crystal structures of LSL complexed with Lac or LacNAc show sugar binding at two (β and γ) of the three possible sites. Moreover, the soaking experiments considered herein reveal significantly different sugar affinities between the above two binding sites. The electron density map of the LSL·Lac complex was of so excellent a quality that it was possible to model a Lac molecule into the γ motif of the β-trefoil. The Fo – Fc map initially calculated without including the disaccharide molecule showed clear density around Asp-141. The Lac molecule could be modeled in this difference density map (Fig. 3A). Failure to remove all the Lac in the final affinity chromatographic step in the purification of LSL is the likely source of this molecule (1Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40455-40463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Additionally, a well ordered glycerol molecule is found in each of the other two motifs, these molecules coming from the short soak in the cryoprotectant solution that contained 30% (v/v) glycerol. In this sense, it has been suggested that this compound together with ethylene glycol is good at mimicking carbohydrate binding (22Inoue K. Sobhany M. Transue T.R. Oguma K. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 3361-3370Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The γ site binds Lac at its nonreducing galactose (Gal) moiety (Fig. 3A). The aromatic ring of Phe-139 makes van der Waals interactions with the plane formed by the C-3, C-4, C-5, and C-6 carbon atoms of the Gal residue in a similar fashion to that seen in other protein-carbohydrate complexes (32Vyas N.K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1991; 1: 732-740Crossref Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 33Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The axial C4 hydroxyl group can form hydrogen bonds with the ring N-ϵ of His-125 and with the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp-141. On the other hand, the C-6 hydroxyl group hydrogen bonds to Nϵ-2 of Gln-142. Furthermore, the ring O-5 coordinates a water molecule that in turn can form hydrogen bonds with the carbonyl oxygen of Asn-132 and the ring Nϵ of His-133. The only interaction involving the glucose residue is that observed between the C3′ hydroxyl group and the NH1 and NH2 atoms of Arg-123. Consistent with this pattern of toxin-Lac interactions, the x-ray structures of some bacterial toxins complexed with Lac show that interaction with the disaccharide is mediated essentially by the galactose (34Sixma T.K. Pronk S.E. Kalk K.H. van Zanten B.A.M. Berghuis A.M. Hol W.G. Nature. 1992; 355: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 35Sixma T.K. Kalk K.H. van Zanten B.A. Dauter Z. Kingma Z. Witholt B. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 890-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 36Merritt E.A. Sarfaty S. van der Akker F. L'Hoir C. Martial J.A. Hol W.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed the higher efficiency of LacNAc relative to Lac in inhibiting both hemagglutination and hemolysis (1Tateno H. Goldstein I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40455-40463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Quick soaking experiments using cryoprotectant solution containing 20 mm LacNAc results in the incorporation of this molecule into the γ site of LSL as revealed by the unambiguous difference electron density (Fig. 3B). The structure of the complex was determined at 2.58-Å resolution (Table I) by molecular replacement (see “Experimental Procedures”). Whereas the Lac portion of LacNAc can perfectly be superposed to the Lac ligand present in the LSL·Lac complex, the presence of the acetamido moiety promoted several new interactions between sugar and protein. Thus, the carbonyl oxygen of the N-acetyl moiety of LacNAc can form hydrogen bonds with the ring Nϵ-1 atom of Trp-131 and with nitrogen atoms NH1 and NH2 of Arg-76; additionally, a water molecule mediates a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom of the acetamido moiety and the peptidic oxygen of Gln-127 (Fig. 3B). No additional sugar binding was observed in the other two potential LSL sites apart from the presence of a glycerol molecule in each motif. In addition to the γ site of LSL, the β site also binds LacNAc as revealed by overnight soaking experiments in the presence of 0.1 m LacNAc. Under these experimental conditions, LSL binds two LacNAc molecules, one at the γ site and one at the β site. In this second binding site, the aromatic ring of Tyr-91 and the side chains of Asp-93 and Asn-94 play similar roles to those of Phe-139, Asp-141, and Gln-142 present in the γ motif, respectively (Fig. 3C). In this case, however, the axial C4 hydroxyl group can only form hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp-93, as there is no amino acid residue equivalent to His-125 in the γ site. An important difference with respect to the γ site is the absence of water molecules mediating interactions between sugar and protein presumably because of critical amino acid changes. Thus, the presence of Ile-85 (equivalent to His-133) and the absence of a residue equivalent to Arg-76 would prevent the stabilization of a water molecule that similarly to the γ site would coordinate the O-5 atom of the galactose residue. On the other hand, the bulky side chain of Phe-73 (equivalent to Val-121), which interacts with Arg-75 through cation-π interactions, sterically hinders the presence of a solvent molecule that would stabilize the acetamido moiety as observed in the γ motif. Finally, no further stabilization of this last group is observed as there is no homologous side chain to Trp-131. As a result of the above amino acid changes between both sugar-binding sites, the electrostatic properties of the surface of both sites are different (Fig. 3D). These results clearly indicate the reduced number of stabilizing interactions between the disaccharide LacNAc in the β site with respect to the γ site that may explain their differences in affinity for this sugar. This correlates well with the average values of the atomic B-factors of the bound ligands in the LSL·(LacNAc)2 complex that indicate a lower occupancy of the β site as compared with the γ site (62 versus 38 Å2; average value for protein atoms in both sites ∼40 Å2). Finally, it is worth noting that although conserving the same structural framework of the β- and γ-site, the α-site does not bind sugars in our experimental conditions. In this regard, the presence of Ala-43 instead of an aromatic residue equivalent to Tyr-91 (β-site) or Phe-137 (γ-site) may be critical for explaining the lack of sugar binding. The structure of the above described complexes between LSL and Lac or LacNAc present close structural similarities to others previously reported for lectin-lactose complexes (33Rini J.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1995; 24: 551-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 37Cioci G. Mitchell E.P. Gautier C. Wimmerova M. Sudakevitz D. Perez S. Gilboa-Garber N. Imberty A.

Biol. 1999; 290: 867-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Thus, the existence of stacking interactions between the Gal ring and an aromatic side chain, together with hydrogen bonds between the axial C4 hydroxyl group of Gal and an acidic lectin side chain, are strictly conserved. This finding is in agreement with the lack of sugar binding by LSL in the α-site. In the particular case of the ricin B-chain (20Rutenber E. Ready M. Robertus J.D.

For comparison purposes, Fig. 3E shows the structure of the Gal-binding site of the C-terminal β-trefoil of the ricin B-chain. The C-terminal Pore-forming Module—The pore-forming module (PFM) of LSL (residues 149–314) has an elongated shape, 70 Å long and 20–40 Å in thickness (Figs. 1 and 4). Apart from a single-turn 310 helix, the β-structure is the only regular secondary structure in the module, consisting of 11 β-strands (β13 to β23), the last two strands crossing it from tip to tip. The PFM of LSL can be suitably divided into two domains (Fig. 4). Domain 2 is a highly twisted five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet capped on one side by an amphipathic loop (residues 212–241). Besides, domain 3 consists of a β-sandwich formed by a two- and a three-stranded anti-parallel sheets, respectively. In contrast to the results obtained with the lectin module, structura"

We investigated the role of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling in HGF/SF-mediated protection of human prostate cancer (DU-145) and Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells against ADR. HGF/SF caused the rapid nuclear translocation of the p65 (RelA) subunit of NF-κB associated with the transient loss of the inhibitory subunit IκB-α. Exposure to HGF/SF caused the activation of an NF-κB luciferase reporter that was blocked or attenuated by the expression of a mutant ‘super-repressor’ IκB-α. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay supershift assays revealed that HGF/SF treatment induced the transient binding of various NF-κB family proteins (p65, p50, c-Rel, and RelB) with radiolabeled NF-κB-binding oligonucleotides. The HGF/SF-mediated protection of DU-145 and MDCK cells against ADR (demonstrated using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays) was abrogated by the IκB-α super-repressor. The ability of HGF/SF to activate NF-κB signaling was dependent on c-Akt → Pak1 (p21-associated kinase-1) signaling (with Pak1 downstream of c-Akt) and was inhibited by the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog). Inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3′-kinase and Src family kinases significantly inhibited HGF/SF-mediated activation of NF-κB, while inhibitors of MEK, protein kinase C, and p70 S6 kinase had a modest effect or no effect on NF-κB activity. HGF/SF induced the expression of several known NF-κB target genes (cIAP-1 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1), cIAP-2, and TRAF-2 (TNF receptor-associated factor-2)) in an NF-κB-dependent manner; HGF/SF blocked the inhibition of expression of these genes by ADR. Experimental manipulation of expression of these genes suggests that they (particularly TRAF-2 and cIAP-2) contribute to the protection against ADR by HGF/SF. These findings suggest that HGF/SF activates NF-κB through a c-Akt → Pak1 signaling pathway that is also dependent on Src, and that NF-κB contributes to HGF/SF-mediated protection against ADR."

Certain H. pylori strains nonopsonized stimulate neutrophils to production of reactive oxygen species causing oxidative damage of the gastric epithelium. Here, the contribution of some H. pylori virulence factors, the blood group antigen-binding adhesin BabA, the sialic acid-binding adhesin SabA, the neutrophil-activating protein HP-NAP, and the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, to the activation of human neutrophils in terms of adherence, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst was investigated. Neutrophils were challenged with wild type bacteria and isogenic mutants lacking BabA, SabA, HP-NAP, or VacA. Mutant and wild type strains lacking SabA had no neutrophil-activating capacity, demonstrating that binding of H. pylori to sialylated neutrophil receptors plays a pivotal initial role in the adherence and phagocytosis of the bacteria and the induction of the oxidative burst. The link between receptor binding and oxidative burst involves a G-protein-linked signaling pathway and downstream activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase as shown by experiments using signal transduction inhibitors.

Colonization of the human stomach with Helicobacter pylori is accompanied by chronic active gastritis, which may lead to peptic ulcer disease, atrophic gastritis, and gastric adenocarcinoma (1Blaser M.J. Sci. Am. 1996; 274: 104-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To date a number of H. pylori virulence factors have been identified. Among these are the urease, the blood group antigen-binding adhesin (BabA), 1The abbreviations used are: BabA, blood group antigen binding adhesin; CL, chemiluminescence; DPI, diphenyleneiodonium; HP-NAP, neutrophil-activating protein of H. pylori; SabA, sialic acid-binding adhesin; VacA, vacuolating cytotoxin of H. pylori; wt, wild type; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GM1, Galβ3GalNAcβ4(NeuAcα3)Galβ4-Glcβ1Cer. the cag pathogenicity island, the vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA), and the H. pylori neutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP). Binding of the bacterium to fucosylated host cell receptors is mediated by the BabA adhesin, an outer membrane protein of H. pylori (2Ilver D. Arnqvist A. Ögren J. Frick I.M. Kersulyte D. Incecik E.T. Berg D.E. Covacci A. Engstrand L. Borén T. Science. 1998; 279: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). The cag pathogenicity island encodes a type IV secretion system that enables translocation of the CagA protein into host cells, where the protein becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently activates a eukaryotic phosphatase leading to dephosphorylation of host cell proteins and morphological changes (3Stein M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Achtman M. Suerbaum S. Helicobacter pylori: Molecular and Cellular Biology. Horizon Scientific Press, Norfolk, UK2001: 227-244Google Scholar). The VacA toxin induces formation of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in eukaryotic cells and causes alterations of tight junctions (4Montecucco C. de Bernard M. Microbes Infect. 2003; 5: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). VacA also forms anion-selective channels, which may be blocked by chloride channel inhibitors (5Szabo I. Brutsche S.

Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Neutrophils play a major role in epithelium injury, because these cells have direct toxic effects on the epithelial cells by releasing reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and proteases (9Balk S.C. Youn H.S. Chung M.H. Lee W.K. Cho M.J. Ko G.H. Park C.K. Kasai H. Rhee K.H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1279-1282PubMed Google Scholar, 10Yoshikawa T. Naito Y. Free Radic. Res. 2000; 33: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). An additional virulence factor of H. pylori bacterial cells is thus the neutrophil-activating capacity, i.e. the ability of certain H. pylori strains to activate human neutrophils in the absence of opsonins (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Strains with neutrophil-activating capacity are significantly more often isolated from patients with peptic ulcer disease (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D.

The factor(s) of H. pylori responsible for the activation of neutrophils are heat-labile and dependent on whole nondisintegrated organisms (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Recently, preincubation with sialylated oligosaccharides demonstrated that the nonopsonic H. pylori-induced activation of human neutrophils occurs by lectinophagocytosis, i.e. recognition of sialylated glycoconjugates on the neutrophil cell surface by a bacterial adhesin leads to the phagocytosis and the oxidative burst reactions (13Teneberg S. Jurstrand M. Karlsson K-A. Danielsson D. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To date, two sialic acid-binding proteins of H. pylori have been characterized: the sialic acid-binding adhesin SabA and the NeuAcα3Galβ4GlcNAcβ3Galβ4GlcNAc-binding neutrophil-activating protein HP-NAP (14Mahdavi J.

Several of these H. pylori-binding gangliosides are also present in human neutrophils (19Stroud M.R. Handa K. Salyan M.E.K. Ito K. Levery S.B. Hakomori S-i. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N.

In addition, some H. pylori strains bind to polyglycosylceramides and glycoproteins of human neutrophils in a sialic acid-dependent binding manner (21Miller-Podraza H. Bergström J. Teneberg S.

In the present study the role of some H. pylori virulence factors in the nonopsonic H. pylori-induced activation of human neutrophils was investigated. Human neutrophils were challenged with wild type H. pylori strains and isogenic deletion mutant strains lacking HP-NAP, BabA, SabA, VacA, or the 37-kDa fragment of VacA, followed by chemiluminescence measurement of the superoxide anions produced by the neutrophils. The nonopsonic adherence to and phagocytosis by neutrophils of wild type and mutant bacterial cells were examined at various time intervals as the appearance of visible macroscopic aggregation/agglutination of neutrophils and by microscopy of acridine orange stained smears. In addition, the effects of signal transduction inhibitors on H. pylori-induced neutrophil activation were studied, to identify intracellular signaling pathways required for H. pylori-induced neutrophil oxidative burst. H. pylori Strains, Culture Conditions, and Labeling—Characteristics of the H. pylori strains are presented in Table I. Strain NCTC 11637 was obtained from the National Collection of Type Cultures, London, UK, strain C-7050 from Professor T. Kosunen, Helsinki, Finland, and strain CCUG 17874 from the Culture Collection University of Göteborg.

The PCR fragment was cloned into the pBluescriptSK± EcoRV site (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The resulting plasmid was linearized with primers napA2F (forward) and napA2R (reverse), and then ligated with the kanamycin resistance (KanR) cassette from pILL600 (22Suerbaum S. Josenhans C. Labigne A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3278-3288Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmid carrying the deleted napA was used for transformation of the J99 strain. For transformation the bacteria were grown for 24 h on agar plates before addition of 2 μg of plasmid DNA. After transformation the bacteria were grown on nonselective plates for 48 h to allow for the expression of antibiotic resistance and then transferred onto kanamycin-containing plates. The transformants were analyzed by PCR using primers napA3F and napA4R which verified that the KanR cassette was inserted into napA. Western blot analysis of napA mutants using anti-HP-NAP antibodies showed that the mutant strain was devoid of HP-NAP expression. The oligonucleotides used for PCR were: napA1F, 5′-TCAAGCCATAGCGGATAAGCT-3′; napA1R, 5′-TTGATAATGGCAAGGAAGTGGA-3′; napA2F, 5′-CACGATCGCATCCGCTTGCA-3′; napA2R, 5′-TTACCGTAACTTATGCGGATGAT-3′; napA3F, 5′-TGGTGTAGGATAGCGATCAAG-3′; and napA4R, 5′-TAATGTCATTCCACTTGTCTAAG-3′. The VacA knock-out mutant (17874/VacA-) and the mutant with deletion of the 37 kDa fragment of VacA (17874/p37-) were constructed as previously described (23Reyrat J.M. Lanzavecchia S. Lupetti P. de Bernard M. Pagliaccia C. Pelicic V. Charrel M. Ulivieri C. Norais N. Ji X. Cabiaux V. Papini E. Rappuoli R. Telford J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For chromatogram binding experiments the bacteria were grown in a microaerophilic atmosphere at 37 °C for 48 h on Brucella medium (Difco Laboratories, Irvine, CA) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Harlan Sera-Lab Loughborough, UK) inactivated at 56 °C, and 1% BBL™ IsoVitalex enrichment (BD France S.A., Le Pont de Claix, France). The mutant strains J99/SabA- and J99/BabA- were cultured on the same medium supplemented with chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml). For the mutant strain J99/SabA-BabA- supplementation with chloramphenicol (20 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml) was used, whereas the 17874/VacA- and 17874/p37- strains were cultured on the above described medium supplemented with kanamycin (20 μg/ml). Bacteria were radiolabeled by the addition of 50 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) diluted in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.3, to the culture plates. After incubation for 12-72 h at 37 °C under microaerophilic conditions, the bacteria were harvested, centrifuged three times, and thereafter suspended to 1 × 108 colony forming units/ml in PBS. The specific activities of the suspensions were ∼1 cpm per 100 bacterial cells. Alternatively, the strains were grown in a microaerophilic atmosphere at 37 °C for 48 h on GC agar plates (GC II agar base, BBL, Cockeysville, MD) supplemented with 1% bovine hemoglobin (BBL), 10% horse serum, and 1% IsoVitaleX enrichment (BBL), without antibiotics for the wild type strains, and with antibiotics as above for the mutant strains J99/SabA-, J99/BabA-, J99/BabA-SabA-, 17874/VacA-, and 17874/p37-. The H. pylori organisms were collected in PBS and used in chemiluminescence and phagocytosis experiments as described below. Chromatogram Binding Assay—Glycosphingolipids were isolated and characterized by mass spectrometry, 1H NMR, and degradation studies, as described (24Karlsson K-A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 138: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). De-sialylation was done by incubating the glycosphingolipids in 1% acetic acid (by volume) at 100 °C for 1 h. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass- or aluminum-backed silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Mixtures of glycosphingolipids (40 μg) or pure compounds (1-4 μg) were separated using chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8, by volume) as solvent system. Chemical detection was accomplished by anisaldehyde (25Waldi D. Stahl E. Dünnschicht-Chromatographie. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1962: 496-515Google Scholar). Binding of 35S-labeled H. pylori to glycosphingolipids on thin-layer chromatograms was done as previously reported (26Ångström J. Teneberg S. Abul Milh M. Larsson T. Leonardsson I. Olsson B.-M.

Dried chromatograms were dipped for 1 min in diethylether/n-hexane (1:5, by volume) containing 0.5% (w/v) polyisobutylmethacrylate (Aldrich). After drying, the chromatograms were soaked in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v), 0.1% NaN3 (w/v), and 0.1% Tween 20 (by volume) for 2 h at room temperature. The chromatograms were subsequently covered with radiolabeled bacteria diluted in PBS (2-5 × 106 cpm/ml). Incubation was done for 2 h at room temperature, followed by repeated washings with PBS. The chromatograms were thereafter exposed to XAR-5 x-ray films (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 12 h. Extraction of Membrane Proteins from Human Neutrophil Granulocytes—Membranes from fresh neutrophils were isolated as described previously (27Moore K.L. Stults N.L. Diaz S. Smith D.F. Cummings R.D. Varki A. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 445-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The outer membrane fragment fraction was dissolved in 25 mm Tris-HCl containing 2.5% SDS and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, heated to 95 °C for 10 min and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Electrophoresis and Binding of H. pylori—SDS-PAGE and staining were carried out with NuPAGE™ gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Briefly, neutrophil membrane proteins samples in SDS sample buffer, with 50 mm dithiothreitol added, were heated to 95 °C for 5 min, and applied on a homogeneous 10% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride (0.2-μm) membranes. The polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was incubated in blocking solution, 3% bovine serum albumin, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% NaN3, pH 8.0, for 1.5 h. The membrane was then incubated with 35S-labeled H. pylori strain CCUG 17874 diluted in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and thereafter washed in a solution of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0. After drying at room temperature, the membrane was exposed to XAR-5 x-ray films overnight. Reference bovine fetuin and bovine asialofetuin were purchased from Sigma. Human Neutrophil Granulocytes—Heparinized blood from healthy blood donors was used to prepare neutrophils by Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences) centrifugation in accordance with the method of Böyum (28Böyum A. Tissue Antigens. 1974; 4: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), slightly modified as described (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). For each series of experiments on a particular day neutrophils were prepared and pooled from three blood donors of the same blood group (A Rh+ or O Rh+). Neutrophils were thus obtained from different blood donors at each experiment. They were suspended in PBS supplemented with MgCl2, CaCl2, glucose, and gelatin as previously described (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The purity and viability of the neutrophils exceeded 95%. Chemiluminescence Experiments—The oxidative burst of neutrophils challenged with nonopsonized whole and live H. pylori organisms was measured with luminol enhanced chemiluminescence (CL) as previously described (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). To each test tube (LKB, Bromma, Sweden) were added 300 μl of PBS supplemented with MgCl2 and CaCl2, 100 μl of neutrophils (5 × 106/ml), 50 μlof10-5m luminol (Sigma), and finally 50 μl of nonopsonized H. pylori (5 × 108/ml). For the signal transduction inhibition experiments neutrophils (5 × 106/ml) were treated with 800 ng of pertussis toxin for 60 or 120 min at 37 °C, with wortmannin (5, 10, or 20 nm) for 5 min at 37 °C, or diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI, 10 μm) for 5 min at 37 °C, centrifuged, and resuspended in PBS supplemented with MgCl2 and CaCl2 before they were challenged with H. pylori cells of strain NCTC 11637 as described above. Pertussis toxin, wortmannin, and DPI were purchased from Calbiochem. For oligosaccharide inhibition experiments 50 μl of H. pylori (5 × 108/ml) were mixed with 50 μl of 3′-sialyllactose (IsoSep, Tullinge, Sweden) to receive final concentrations of 0.1-1.0 mm in the CL, for 15 min at 37 °C, and 100 μl of the mixture was thereafter transferred to the test tube for CL measuring. The oxidative bursts of the neutrophils were measured as luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence with a luminometer (LKB Wallac 1251, Turku, Finland), and the measurements were always started within 1 min after the bacterial suspension had been added. The assays were performed at 37 °C, and CL from each sample was measured at 60- to 90-s intervals during a period of 30-60 min, and data were stored in a computer for computerized calculations. This technique thus measures both the external and internal oxidative bursts of the nonopsonic phagocytosis by neutrophils, which was previously checked by quenching the external burst in the presence of catalase (2000 units/ml), and the internal one in the presence of azide (1 mm) and horseradish peroxidase (4 units/ml) as described by Lock and Dahlgren (29Lock R. Dahlgren C. APMIS. 1988; 96: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The H. pylori strains NCTC 11637 (giving a strong and rapid CL response) and C-7050 (inducing no CL response) (8Rautelin H. Blomberg B. Fredlund H. Järnerot G. Danielsson D. Gut. 1993; 34: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) were included in each series of experiments as positive and negative controls, respectively. Adherence, Phagocytosis, and Neutrophil Agglutination Assays—To each test tube were added 350 μl of PBS supplemented with MgCl2 and CaCl2, 100 μl of neutrophils (5 × 106/ml), and 50 μl of nonopsonized H. pylori organisms (5 × 108/ml). Adherence to and phagocytosis by neutrophils of wild type and mutant H. pylori strains were examined by microscopy (see below) at the various time intervals of <2-5, 20-30, and 60-90 min, and for the appearance of visible, i.e. macroscopic agglutination (aggregation) of neutrophils by ocular inspection of the tubes at the same time intervals. For microscopic examination of adherence/phagocytosis assays, and the formation of neutrophil agglutinates/aggregates by H. pylori cells, 10 μl of the H. pylori/neutrophil mixture was smeared on a glass slide within an area of ∼2.5-3 mm2, air-dried, fixed in cold methanol for 5 min, washed in distilled water, and then stained with acridine orange as described by the manufacturer. The slides were inspected with a Zeiss fluorescence microscope for incident light with appropriate filter combinations at a magnification of 400× to look for bacteria that had adhered to neutrophils and/or were phagocytosed. The results obtained by this technique corresponded well to previously reported findings by electron microscopy (30Rautelin H. von Bonsdorff C.H. Blomberg B. Danielsson D. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 47: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, even though adherence of acridine orange-stained bacteria of H. pylori to the neutrophil cell membrane looks different from those that are obviously inside the cell, phagocytosis of an individual bacterial cell cannot be definitely separated from adherence with this technique. Adherence/phagocytosis have therefore been taken together and were graded as negative (-) when neutrophils were evenly dispersed with only occasionally adhered H. pylori cells; minor (+) or moderate (++) adherence/phagocytosis with 5 < 10 or 10 ≤ 20 bacterial cells, respectively, per neutrophil in representative fields of view; and heavy (+++) adherence/phagocytosis with >20 bacterial cells per neutrophil. In the signal transduction inhibition experiments, neutrophils were treated with pertussis toxin, wortmannin, and DPI in concentrations given above, and adherence to and phagocytosis by neutrophils of strain NCTC 11637, as well as visible macroscopic agglutination were examined at the time intervals <2-5, 20-30, and 60-90 min, and compared with untreated neutrophils challenged with the same strain. Adherence, phagocytosis, and neutrophil agglutination were graded as described above. Binding of H. pylori to Human Neutrophil Gangliosides Is Lost after Deletion of the SabA Adhesin—The sialic acid binding capacities of the wild type and deletion mutant H. pylori strains utilized in this study were evaluated by binding of the bacteria to glycosphingolipids separated on thin-layer chromatograms. The results are exemplified in Fig. 1 and summarized in Table I. The criterion used for sialic acid recognition was binding to the acid glycosphingolipid fraction of human neutrophils (Fig. 1, lane 2) with no binding after de-sialylation (Fig. 1, lane 3). Thus, while both the parent strains and their mutants bound to the nonacid reference glycosphingolipid gangliotetraosylceramide (Fig. 1, lane 1), binding to human neutrophil gangliosides was observed for all strains except the J99/SabA- mutant (Fig. 1C), the J99/BabA-SabA- mutant (not shown), and the C-7050 strain (not shown). H. pylori Also Bind to Human Neutrophil Membrane Proteins—Binding of SabA-expressing H. pylori strain CCUG 17874 to human neutrophil membrane proteins is shown in Fig. 2B. As reported previously (21Miller-Podraza H. Bergström J. Teneberg S. Abul Milh M. Longard M. Olsson B.-M. Uggla L. Karlsson K.-A. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6309-6313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the bacteria bound to several proteins with apparent relative molecular masses between 40 and 70 kDa. Binding of H. pylori to Sialic Acid-carrying Neutrophil Receptors Is Necessary for Induction of the Oxidative Burst—The neutrophil-activating abilities of the wild type and deletion mutant H. pylori strains were investigated by luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Challenge of human neutrophils with the wild type H. pylori strains J99, CCUG 17874, and NCTC 11637 resulted in strong CL responses (Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6), although there was some strain to strain variation in the ability to induce the oxidative burst manifested by differences in peak values (millivolts) and time to reach peak (minutes). In most cases a biphasic response was observed, where the initial phase is due to activation of the plasma membrane (extracellular) NADPH oxidase, whereas the second phase represents activation of both plasma membrane and the intracellular NADPH oxidases. The extracellular and the intracellular production of H2O2 are linked to two separate pools of NADPH oxidase localized to the plasma membrane and granule membranes, respectively (31Karlsson A. Nixon J.B. McPhail L.C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 2000; 67: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar).Fig. 4Oxidative burst activation of human neutrophil granulocytes challenged with nonopsonized wild type H. pylori strain C-7050 (C-7050) and strain J99 (J99 wt) and its isogenic mutants with deletions of HPNAP (J99/NAP-), the BabA adhesin (J99/BabA-), the SabA adhesin (J99/SabA-), and both the BabA adhesin and the SabA adhesin (J99/BabA-SabA-).

https://openalex.org/W1982276921,"Missing in metastasis (MIM) gene encodes an actin binding protein that is expressed at low levels in a subset of malignant cell lines. MIM protein tagged by green fluorescent protein (GFP) colocalizes with cortactin, an Arp2/3 complex activator, and interacts directly with the SH3 domain of cortactin. Recombinant full-length MIM promotes markedly cortactin and Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin polymerization in an SH3 dependent manner. In contrast, MIM-CT, a short splicing variant of MIM, binds poorly to cortactin in vitro and is unable to enhance actin polymerization. Full-length MIM binds to G-actin with a similar affinity as N-WASP-VCA, a constitutively active form of N-WASP, and inhibits N-WASP-VCA-mediated actin polymerization as analysed in vitro. The significance of the association of MIM with cortactin and G-actin was evaluated in NIH3T3 cells expressing several MIM constructs. Overexpression of full-length wild-type MIM-GFP inhibited markedly the motility of NIH3T3 cells induced by PDGF and that of human vein umbilical endothelial cells induced by sphingosine 1 phosphate. However, an MIM mutant with deletion of the WH2 domain, which is responsible for G-actin binding, enhanced cell motility. The motility inhibition imposed by MIM was compromised in the cells overexpressing N-WASP. In contrast, deletion of an MIM proline-rich domain, which is required for an optimal binding to cortactin, substantiated the MIM-mediated inhibition of cell motility. These data imply that MIM regulates cell motility by modulating different Arp2/3 activators in a distinguished manner."
https://openalex.org/W2039000698,"The Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus encodes a G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor termed KSHV-GPCR. Expression of this constitutively active GPCR leads to cell transformation and vascular overgrowth characteristic of Kaposi's sarcoma. Previously, we have shown that CXCR2, the closest human homolog, is similarly able to transform cells if continuously stimulated or constitutively activated by amino-acid exchange D138V of the DRY sequence. Here, we demonstrate that STAT3 activation is a prerequisite for transformation in KSHV-GPCR and CXCR2 transfected NIH 3T3 cells. In KSHV-GPCR and D138V transfected cells, STAT-3 is constitutively phosphorylated on Tyr705. In CXCR2 transfected NIH 3T3 cells and human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC), which express the CXCR2 constitutively, STAT3 is phosphorylated upon stimulation with IL-8 (CXCL8). Focus formation in NIH 3T3 cells transfected with the KSHV-GPCR, CXCR2, or the D138V mutant, was blocked by the specific JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Typical functions of the CXCR2 including actin stress fiber formation, haptotaxis, and the angiogenic response in HMEC shown by tube formation in Matrigel were blocked by AG490. These data suggest that the transforming capacity and migratory responses that are involved in tumor development, metastasis, and angiogenesis in KSHV or CXCR2-expressing cells is at least partially mediated through a JAK2-STAT3 dependent pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2035798825,"In addition to its postsynaptic role, the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) serves as a presynaptic autoreceptor, where it provides continuous feedback regulation of dopamine release at nerve terminals for processes as diverse as emotional tone and locomotion. D3R signaling ability is supported by an association with filamin (actin-binding protein 280), which localizes the receptor with G proteins in plasma membrane lipid rafts but is not appreciably antagonized in a classical sense by the ligand-mediated activation of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) and β-arrestins. In this study, we investigate GRK-mediated regulation of D3R·filamin complex stability and its effect on D3 R protein ·G signaling potential. Studies in HEK-293 cells show that in the absence of agonist the D3R immunoprecipitates in a complex containing both filamin A and β-arrestin2. Moreover, the filamin directly interacts with β-arrestin2 as assessed by immunoprecipitation and yeast two-hybrid studies. With reductions in basal GRK2/3 activity, an increase in the basal association of filamin A and β-arrestin2 with D3R is observed. Conversely, increases in the basal GRK2/3 activity result in a reduction in the interaction between the D3R and filamin but a relative increase in the agonist-mediated interaction between β-arrestin2 and the D3R. Our data suggest that the D3R, filamin A, and β-arrestin form a signaling complex that is destabilized by agonist- or expression-mediated increases in GRK2/3 activity.

D3R has a higher affinity for DA than D2R, and experiments with D3R knock-out mice suggest that in the striatum/nucleus acumbens the D3R may regulate DA release at lower DA concentrations than D2R by modulating DA secretion rates rather than DA synthesis or DA transporter activity (1.Joseph J.D.

The G protein-mediated signaling of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) in general and D2 and D3Rs in particular should terminate from arrestin protein binding to receptor intracellular loop or C-tail residues that are GPCR kinase (GRK)-phosphorylated (7.Luttrell L.M.

The subsequent trafficking of arrestin-receptor complexes to clathrin-rich regions of plasma membrane and clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) depends on the extent of GRK phosphorylation (10.Oakley R.H.

Autoreceptors that function as permanent sensors of extracellular neurotransmitter concentrations may require alternative mechanisms to regulate the transition between the classical G protein signaling and desensitized states observed for receptors with more conventional signaling responsibilities. In fact, although D3Rs can be induced to internalize to a small degree, the large majority of D3Rs remain at the plasma membrane and fail to internalize appreciably in CCPs after brief periods of DA stimulation (3.Kim K.M.

In contrast to this post signaling behavior, the D3R and D2R share a requirement for binding lipid raft-associated filamin (actin-binding protein 280) in order to couple efficiently to G proteins (14.Lin R.

Filamin A also binds other GPCRs, including metabotropic glutamate receptors type 7 (17.Enz R. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), calcitonin receptors (18.Seck T. Baron R. Horne W.C. J. Biol.

Simon E.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 1092-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), suggesting that filamin may be an integral component for regulating the stability of receptor-G protein signaling complexes. The small extent of DA-mediated D3R endocytosis (3.Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) suggests that the repetitive cycles of ligand-mediated GRK phosphorylation followed by intracellular dephosphorylation common to many other GPCRs are not critical for regulating D3R signaling (13.Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). However, GRK knock-out mice have revealed that receptors underlying dopaminergic-mediated locomotion do become supersensitive to ligand in the absence of some specific GRKs (20.Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Thus, significant GRK modulation of D3R behavior may be highly likely despite the arrestin-trafficking results indicating otherwise. Here we show that D3R, β-arrestin, and filamin form a basal signaling complex. The elevation of cellular GRK activity either by ligand addition or increases in the absolute amount of intracellular GRKs decreases the stability of this complex and results in a dramatic reduction in the G protein signaling potential of the D3R. These findings suggest how the D3R, as an autoreceptor, could rapidly desensitize and resensitize in order to provide fast feedback on short term fluctuations in DA concentration.

D3R-S309A was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and filamin A in pCDNA 3.0 was provided by Dr. Y. Ohta (Harvard University). Caine AC-V (adenylyl cyclase V) cDNA was from Dr. Y. Ishikawa (Columbia University). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid vectors and reagents were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA), and library screening was conducted as previously described (27.Laporte S.A. Oakley R.H. Zhang J. Holt J.A. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3712-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The amino terminus of β-arrestin2 (amino acids 1–80) subcloned into the yeast vector, pAS2-1, that contains the DNA-binding domain was used as bait. The human kidney cDNA library (100 μg) constructed in pACT2 and the bait plasmids were transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Y187 and transformants were selected on artificial medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. After a 4-day incubation at 30 °C, a β-galactosidase assay was conducted for His+ clones to eliminate false positives, and resulting His+/β-galactosidase+ clones were sequenced with an automated ABI DNA sequencer. Whole Cell Phosphorylation—HEK-293 cells were transfected with human β2-adrenergic receptor tagged at the amino terminus with the HA epitope (HA-β2AR), FLAG-D2R, or HA-D3R with or without GRKs. Cells were stimulated with 10 μm isoproterenol or DA for 5 min. Detailed procedures are described in our previous studies (3.Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J.

Protein concentration was assessed using the Bio-Rad DC protein assay. Phosphorylated receptors were quantitated using a PhosphorImager or were visualized by exposure to autoradiography film. Photoaffinity Labeling—Photoaffinity labeling of the D2R and D3R was carried out as previously described (28.Amlaiky N. Kilpatrick B.F. Caron M.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 176: 436-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Confocal Microscopy—For the β-arrestin translocation assays, HEK-293 cells were transfected with β-arrestin2-GFP (24.Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) and D3R with or without GRK3. One day after transfection, cells were seeded onto 35-mm dishes containing a centered, 1-cm well formed from a glass coverslip sealed hole in the plastic (confocal dishes) and allowed to recover 1 day. Cells were incubated with 2 ml of minimal essential medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and viewed on a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope. Immunoprecipitation—COS-7 or HEK-293 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine or the calcium phosphate precipitation method, respectively. After 48 h, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) on the rotation wheel for 1 h at 4 °C. Supernatants were mixed with 35 μl of 50% slurry of FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) between 2 and 3 h on the rotation wheel. Beads were washed with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40) three times for 10 min each. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. GTPγS Binding—Membrane proteins were prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm EDTA. For GTPγS binding, membrane proteins were incubated in 125 mm HEPES buffer containing 1 mm GDP and 100 nm [35S]GTPγS, incubated for 2 h at 30 °C, filtered on a GF/B filter, and counted with a liquid scintillation counter. The coupling efficiency between receptor and G protein was determined as fmol of Gα accumulated for 2 h at 30 °C/fmol of receptor added. Receptor expression levels were closely matched between experimental groups. Measurement of Cyclic AMP—Whole cell cyclic AMP accumulation was measured in HEK-293 cells by column chromatography as described in Ref. 23.Robinson S.W. Caron M.G. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar. Dopamine D3 Receptor Shows a Relatively Heavy Constitutive Phosphorylation—As shown in Fig. 1A (right), after radio-labeling of HEK-293 cells using [125I]NAPS (N-(p-aminophenethy)spiperone), D3Rs resolve into three different bands upon analysis by SDS-PAGE: a major band between 60 and 80 kDa, a minor band between 40 and 50 kDa, and a third band at 25 kDa, which may represent incompletely processed receptor protein. It is apparent from Fig. 1B that the total phosphorylation of the D3R in HEK-293 cells does not appreciably increase after 5 min of agonist exposure (pre- and postexposure results varied by less than 5%). We have previously demonstrated a similar basal relative lack of change in phosphorylation of the D3R to endogenous and overexpressed GRK2 in HEK cells at 10 min (3.Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). In contrast, the basal phosphorylation of the D3R was 5 times higher than the basal level of phosphorylation of a comparable amount of β2AR protein, whose phosphorylation also increased by more than 3-fold in the presence of isoproterenol (Fig. 1B, leftmost lanes). Moreover, the relatively high basal phosphorylation of the D3R and its lack of agonist-induced phosphorylation can be reversed by exchanging its third intracellular loop for the third intracellular loop of the D2R (3.Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These results indicate that D3R undergoes a marginal change in total phosphorylation in response to agonist stimulation of GRK activity as opposed to the 50% agonist-mediated increases in phosphorylation apparent for the D2LR (Fig. 1B, right panel), which was used as a positive control. Dopamine D3 Receptor Is Associated Basally with Arrestin— GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation changes GPCR affinity for arrestins. Since the phosphorylation status of the D3Rin the absence of agonist was unexpectedly high compared with that of β2AR or D2R, the interaction between the D3R and β-arrestin was assessed for the basal state. A Western blot for β-arrestins isolated from D3R immunoprecipitates of COS-7 cells shows that the D3R associates with β-arrestin2 under basal conditions (Fig. 1C, lane 2). Agonist exposure does not significantly change the degree of this association (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). A negligible agonist-induced D3R phosphorylation is consistent with both the observed lack of change in the co-immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 1C, lane 3), and the absence of translocation of β-arrestins to D3Rs at 5 min after agonist treatment (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Exogenous GRK Expression Reduces the Basal Localization of the D3R with β-Arrestin while Facilitating Agonist-induced β-Arrestin Recruitment—We have observed both in COS-7 and HEK-293 cells that DA treatment does not augment the basal association of D3R with β-arrestin. However, an enhancement of GRK activity in these cells resulting from transfection of a plasmid encoding GRK noticeably increased the relative degree of agonist-dependent association of β-arrestins with D3R in clathrin-coated pits as observed by microscopy (Fig. 1D, lower panel). A corresponding immunoprecipitation experiment to determine the association of β-arrestin with the D3R in the presence of transfected GRK3 and DA treatment is shown in Fig. 2A (lanes 2 and 3). The results are consistent with the microscopic observations showing that arrestin translocation is observable in coated pits under these conditions (Fig. 1D, lower panels). The co-expression of GRKs appears to decrease the basal association of β-arrestins with D3Rs. This is evident from the Western blots showing the amounts of β-arrestin1 and -2 that were immunoprecipitated with the FLAG-tagged D3R in the absence of agonist (Fig. 2B, lane 2 versus lane 3 and lane 4 versus lane 5). We observed above that agonist can drive D3Rs to CCPs in the presence of elevated GRKs. To show that a similar behavior occurs under basal conditions, we trapped D3Rs in CCPs using the endocytosis inhibitor dynamin1-K44A. As shown in Fig. 2C, dynamin1-K44A alone did not have any effect on the subcellular localization of β-arrestin2-GFP. However, co-expression of GRK2 or GRK3 caused the accumulation of β-arrestin2-GFP at the plasma membrane. This accumulation of β-arrestin2-GFP is qualitatively similar to what we have previously reported for 10 μm dopamine-stimulated D3R in the presence of dynamin1-K44A (3.Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These results suggest that GRKs change the relative compartmentalization of the D3R with β-arrestins when agonist is absent either by reducing the complement of β-arrestins prebound to the D3R or shifting the equilibrium distribution of β-arrestin/D3R toward CCPs. Consequently, other proteins that are also basally associated with D3R may be affected by changes in GRK activity. β-Arrestin2 Interacts with the D3R-associated Filamin—The agonist-independent localization of β-arrestins with D3Rs suggests that proteins basally binding D3Rs are probable β-arrestin binding partners. This was tested in COS-7 cells for filamin A, which is localized in plasma membrane lipid rafts and is known to be important for the regulation of D3R signaling in cells (15.Li M. Li C. Weingarten P. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Zhou Q.Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells in comparison with other cell lines, such as HEK-293 cells, express relatively low levels of endogenous β-arrestins and thus provide a better background in which to assess transfected arrestin interactions by immunological methods (29.Menard L. Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Lin F.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). An association under basal conditions between β-arrestin2 and filamin A was confirmed by Western blot of COS-7 cell immunoprecipitates obtained using FLAG-tagged β-arrestin2 and anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3A). There are three human filamin isotypes (A, B, and C). They are ∼70% homologous and structurally similar, consisting of multiple (twenty-four) Ig-like repeats that extend through their C termini (30.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Their degree of homology and functional redundancy (30.van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1538: 99-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) suggests they all are potential β-arrestin binding partners. Indeed, a yeast two-hybrid library screen in an attempt to identify β-arrestin2-interacting proteins using the first 80 amino acids of the β-arrestin2 N terminus as bait yielded two colonies containing the distal third of human filamin C. The ability of full-length β-arrestin2 to also interact with this filamin segment is shown in Fig. 3B. As observed above, the basal association of β-arrestin with filamin suggests that filamin may also be subject to GRK regulation. If so, D3R signaling could be dramatically affected by changes in GRK activity directed toward destabilizing filamin/receptor association. To investigate this question, we began by studying the general relationship between filamin and D3R signaling in cells that do not normally express filamin A. Filamin Expression Regulates the Coupling of the D3R to G Protein—The importance of filamin to D3R second messenger signaling can be established using M2 cells, which normally do not express filamin A (15.Li M. Li C. Weingarten P. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Zhou Q.Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16.Li M. Bermak J.C. Wang Z.W. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). First, we are able to transfect M2 cells with quantitatively similar amounts of filamin A as contained in A7 cells (Fig. 4A). Although the total amounts of expressed immunoreactive filamin in the cell populations are similar, immunostaining and GFP co-transfection demonstrated that only one-third to one-half of the M2 cells are transfected and the efficiency of co-transfection, although appreciable, is less than 100% (data not shown). We investigated the relationship between filamin A and G protein signaling of the D3R in M2 cells by measuring GTPγS binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of DA (Fig. 4B). In order to improve the sensitivity of the assay, GTPγS binding was measured in M2 and control A7 cells transfected with the α subunit of Go protein (Gαo) in addition to D3R. With coupling efficiency defined as the number of GTPγS molecules bound to the α subunit of G protein per receptor molecule, the basal G protein coupling of the D3R was 9.4 ± 0.4% in M2 cells and 19.2 ± 1.7% in the control A7 cells, which express filamin A (Fig. 4B) (21.Cunningham C.C. Gorlin J.B. Kwiatkowski D.J. Hartwig J.H. Janmey P.A. Byers H.R. Stossel T.P. Science. 1992; 255: 325-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Co-expression of filamin A in M2 cells (M2-Filamin A) increased G protein coupling of D3R to levels more nearly equivalent to those observed in A7 cells (Fig. 4B, middle curve). D3R-S309A, a D3R mutant that has a point mutation in an amino acid important for filamin A binding (15.Li M. Li C. Weingarten P. Bunzow J.R. Grandy D.K. Zhou Q.Y. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 63: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), exhibited reduced coupling efficiency (Fig. 4C). These results indicate a role for filamin A in D3R-G protein signaling and suggest that alteration of filamin A/D3R association would be one means to rapidly change D3R signaling potential. Agonist Treatment Reduces the Association between the D3R and Filamin A—Filamin A interacts with a motif in the D3R third cytoplasmic loop (14.Lin R. Karpa K. Kabbani N. Goldman-Rakic P. Levenson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5258-5263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16.Li M. Bermak J.C. Wang Z.W. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and a decrease in the cellular content of filamin A reduces, but does not totally prevent, D3R signaling (Fig. 4, B and C). As such, receptors may retain the capacity to bind arrestins in the absence of filamin, and this is demonstrated by the immunoblot in Fig. 4D, where β-arrestin2 co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-D3R in M2 cells. However, a dynamic reduction in the interaction between D3R and filamin A could provide a means to desensitize the receptor. We therefore tested whether agonist treatment disrupts the interaction between the D3R and filamin A. As shown in Fig. 4E by immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged D3R and immunoblotting for filamin A, the association of D3R with filamin A is rapidly reduced at 5 min to 64.0 ± 15.7% of control by DA treatment (30 nm). Exogenous GRK Expression Reduces the Basal Association between D3R and Filamin A—GRK activity increases secondarily to agonist activation of GPCRs. Therefore, we tested whether the ability of agonists to dissociate filamin A-receptor complexes could be reproduced by enhancing GRK activity without exposing receptors to agonist. In COS-7 cells, the co-expression of GRK2 or GRK3 reduces the basal interaction between D3R and filamin A (Fig. 5A, upper panel, compare lane 3 versus lane 4 and both lanes 3 and 4 versus lane 2) as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation of the FLAG-tagged receptor and immunoblotting for filamin A. Additionally, as discussed in Fig. 2B, GRK co-expression reduces the basal association of D3R with β-arrestins (Fig. 5A, lower panel, compare lane 3 and lane 4 and lane 3 versus lane 2). In contrast, a kinase-dead, dominant negative GRK2 (GRK2-K220R) enhances the basal association of the D3R with filamin A and that of the D3R with β-arrestin (Fig. 5B, compare lane 2 versus lane 3). These effects of GRK activity on the interactions between the D3R, filamin A, and β-arrestin were not direct results of GRK2 phosphorylation of filamin A. In other words, purified filamin A was not phosphorylated by purified GRK2 (data not shown). GRK Expression Reduces D3R Signaling—Since an association between the D3R and filamin A is needed for efficient G protein coupling, effects of GRK expression on the G protein coupling and the inhibition of cAMP production were tested. As expected from the results in Fig. 5, A and B, GRK overexpression significantly reduced both the basal and agonist-induced G protein coupling of the D3R as assessed by GTPγS binding (Fig. 5C). The GTPγS results indicate that second messenger production should be inhibited less well with excess GRK expression (i.e. the D3R-mediated decrease in cellular cAMP content should be smaller). To test the effects of GRKs on the ability of the D3R to inhibit cAMP production, the cellular cAMP was first raised by forskolin stimulation, and the D3R-mediated decrease in cellular cAMP was determined with increasing concentrations of quinpirole in cells transiently expressing GRK2 or GRK3. The dose-response curves in the presence of added kinase exhibit a decrease in Vmax and an increase in IC50 (i.e. a shift of the curve to the right) (Fig. 5D). The IC50 (nm) and the maximal inhibition (%) for the control (0.31 ± 0.09 nm and 70 ± 7% (p < 0.05)) is shifted to 0.58 ± 0.15 nm and 55 ± 3% for GRK2 and to 0.53 ± 0.01 nm and 49 ± 3% (p < 0.05) for GRK3. Recent studies on the distribution of D3R protein in the brain show that it is expressed on virtually all dopaminergic neurons (4.Diaz J. Pilon C. Le Foll B. Gros C. Triller A. Schwartz J.C. Sokoloff P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 8677-8684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Gurevich E.V. Joyce J.N. Neuropsychopharmacology. 1999; 20: 60-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), strongly supporting the idea of the D3R as an autoreceptor. In agreement with this autoreceptor hypothesis, only a negligible fraction of plasma membrane D3R internalizes as a result of persistent DA stimulation, even with increased GRK activity, so that the plasma membrane population of D3Rs remains relatively constant (3.Kim K.M. Valenzano K.J. Robinson S.R. Yao W.D. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37409-37414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Therefore, GRK/β-arrestin-directed receptor internalization in CCPs plays a relatively minor role in the short term, agonist-mediated D3R desensitization process, whereas GRK regulation of D3R plasma membrane compartmentalization may play a more significant role. Our studies indicate that GRKs serve as rheostats for adjusting the agonist-mediated G protein signaling potential of D3Rs that are in basal conformations. The D3R possesses an extensive third intracellular loop that contains multiple, putative GRK phosphorylation sites surrounding and dispersed throughout the filamin binding domain (14.Lin R. Karpa K. Kabbani N. Goldman-Rakic P. Levenson R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5258-5263Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 16.Li M. Bermak J.C. Wang Z.W. Zhou Q.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 446-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that basal GRK phosphorylation of these sites potentially reduces D3R binding to filamin and greatly reduces G protein-mediated signaling. Thus, basal GRK activity through phosphorylation of the D3R third loop may simultaneously determine both the number of D3R signaling complexes in filamin-rich lipid rafts and the extent of their agonist-mediated signaling, since agonist binding appears to shift receptors away from an association with filamin to one with β-arrestin. In this novel GPCR desensitization model, basal GRK activity controls formation of D3R·β-arrestin·filamin complexes, raising the question as to why arrestins need to co-localize with receptors and filamin at this stage. A general and perhaps the most basic explanation may be that arrestins are co-localized because this region is where signaling occurs and where homologous desensitization should occur most expeditiously. An explanation for the D3R in particular may lie in the role D3Rs presumably fill as autoreceptors. In order to provide continuous monitoring of ligand concentrations, D3Rs should be more resistant to removal from the cell surface than receptors without this functional requirement. As such, the D3Rs exhibit relatively limited ability to remain associated with arrestins in comparison with other GPCRs, which is indicative of an intrinsically lower affinity. Therefore, from mass action considerations, the local concentration of arrestins plays a much greater role in sustaining D3R desensitization than it would for a receptor with intrinsically greater arrestin affinity. Moreover, induced changes in the local concentration of β-arrestins with D3Rs that are reciprocal to changes in GRK activity may provide a negative feedback for maintaining receptor signaling potential relatively constant. It would be interesting to test whether this novel model of GPCR desensitization will be applicable to other autoreceptor GPCRs that are involved in neurotransmitter concentration-dependent regulation of secretion. Overall, D3R signaling may be desensitized by at least two GRK-mediated mechanisms. Desensitization occurs with a reduction in G protein coupling due to an inability of filamin to localize receptors near G proteins. Alternatively, desensitization may occur from a potentially reversible, direct blockade of G protein coupling by arrestin/receptor binding. Only profound enhancements in GRK activity can marginally sustain a more classical β-arrestin/receptor desensitization picture involving clathrin-mediated receptor endocytosis. An observation indicating that a modulation of basal GRK activity could be therapeutically useful for DA-related illness stems from studies of GRK6 knock-out mice. These animals become hyperresponsive to DA stimulation (31.Gainetdinov R.R. Bohn L.M. Sotnikova T.D. Cyr M. Laakso A. Macrae A.D. Torres G.E. Kim K.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Premont R.T. Neuron. 2003; 38: 291-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), indicating a role of GRK6 in regulation of postsynaptic D2-like receptors. Additionally, the GRK6 knock-out mouse striatal membranes display similarly increased GTPγS binding relative to wild type mouse controls, as do our control cells compared with cells expressing additional GRK2 or -3. Interestingly, we observed that GRK3-KO mice are hyposensitive to DA stimulations in locomotor assays (20.Gainetdinov R.R. Premont R.T. Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar), a finding that would be consistent with a specific role of this GRK in the regulation of DA autoreceptor function. Thus, if a genetic reduction of GRK activity can enhance dopamine receptor signaling in vivo, then a corresponding type-specific GRK inhibitor/activator might facilitate responsiveness to suboptimal levels of endogenous dopamine in the treatment of movement disorders like Parkinson's disease or to other monoaminergic neurotransmitters such as serotonin in the treatment of mood disorders like depression. We thank Dr. Yasutaka Ohta for filamin reagents, plasmids, and cells and Dr. Allen Eckhardt for help in evaluating filamin A as a GRK2 substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2052941747,"RUNX transcription factors are important in development and in numerous types of human cancer. They act as either transcriptional activators or repressors and can be proto-oncogenes or tumour suppressors. Understanding their regulation and interaction may explain how RUNX factors contribute to such different and often opposing biological processes. We show that RUNX3 regulates RUNX1 expression, contributing to the mutually exclusive expression of RUNX3 and RUNX1 in human B lymphoid cell lines. RUNX3 repressed the RUNX1 P1 promoter by binding specifically to conserved RUNX sites near the transcription start of the promoter. siRNA inhibition of RUNX3 in lymphoblastoid cells resulted in increased RUNX1 expression, indicating that continuous expression of physiological levels of RUNX3 is required to maintain repression. Furthermore, expression of RUNX3 was required for efficient proliferation of B cells immortalized by Epstein–Barr virus. Cross-regulation between different RUNX family members is therefore a means of controlling RUNX protein expression and must now be considered in the interpretation of pathological changes due to loss of RUNX3 tumour suppressor function or following gene duplication or translocation events."
https://openalex.org/W2149920094,"Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from a CAG (glutamine) trinucleotide expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. The role of the striatum-enriched A2A adenosine receptor (A2A-R) in Huntington's disease has attracted much attention lately. In the present study, we found that expression of mutant Htt with expanded poly(Q) significantly reduced the transcript levels of the endogenous A2A-R in PC12 cells and primary striatal neurons. Cotransfection of various promoter constructs of the A2A-R gene and an expression construct of poly(Q)-expanded Htt revealed that the Htt mutant suppressed the core promoter activity of the A2A-R gene. Stimulation of the A2A-R using CGS21680, forskolin, and a constitutively active cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) mutant elevated the reduced promoter activity of the A2A-R gene by mutant Htt. Moreover, the effect of CGS was blocked by an A2A-R-selective antagonist (CSC), two inhibitors of protein kinase A, and two dominant negative mutants of (CREB). The protein kinase A/CREB pathway therefore is involved in regulating A2A-R promoter activity. Consistently, an atypical CRE site (TCCAGG) is located in the core promoter region of the A2A-R gene. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift assay and mutational inactivation further demonstrated the functional binding of CREB to the core promoter region and showed that expression of poly(Q)-expanded Htt abolished the binding of CREB to this site. Stimulation of the A2A-R restored the reduced CREB binding caused by the mutant and concurrently reduced mutant Htt aggregation. Collectively, the poly(Q)-expanded mutant Htt suppressed expression of the A2A-R by inhibiting its core promoter at least partially by preventing CREB binding.

The causative mutation is a CAG trinucleotide expansion in exon 1 of the Huntingtin (Htt) gene. Normal chromosomes have 35 or fewer CAG repeats in the N-terminal region, whereas HD is associated with 36 or more repeats (1.The Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6882) Google Scholar). The CAG repeats are translated into polyglutamine residues (poly(Q)) in the Htt protein. When the number of CAG repeats exceeds 36, specific degeneration of several brain areas (e.g. the striatum and cortex) occurs. The reason for such regional susceptibility to mutant Htt with poly(Q) expansion remains unclear. Accumulating evidence from different laboratories suggests that mutant Htt forms aggregates and causes aberrant protein-protein interactions with a number of important transcription factors or coactivators, such as p53, CREB binding protein (CBP), SP1, and TAFII130 (2.Steffan J.S.

Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). Sequestration of and/or interference with important transcriptional regulatory proteins have been proposed to be critical mechanisms in HD progression. For example, mutant Htt is known to be associated with the Sp1-TAFII130 complex and causes improper location of RNA polymerase II on the promoter region of the dopamine D2 receptor gene, which subsequently hinders transcription of the gene (5.Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Moreover, mutant Htt has been shown to act as a transcriptional coactivator of the nuclear hormone receptor (13.Yohrling G.J. Farrell L.A. Hollenberg A.N. Cha J.H. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 28-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Note that the effect of mutant Htt on the overall gene expression profiles appeared to be specific because no changes in the expression of cytoskeletal proteins (including MAP2, glial fibrillary acidic protein, myelin basic proteins, and neurofilaments), enzymes of intermediary metabolism (such as glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), caspases, mitochondrial proteins, or proteolytic enzymes were observed in a transgenic HD mouse model (14.Cha J.H. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 387-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The A2A adenosine receptor (A2A-R) is enriched in Htt/poly(Q)n-sensitive, enkephalin-containing striatal neurons (15.Ferre S. O'Connor W.T. Fuxe K. Ungerstedt U. J.

Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We previously cloned cDNA and the gene of the A2A-R, which contains seven transmembrane domains and belongs to the G protein-coupled receptor family (18.Chu Y.Y. Tu K.H. Lee Y.C. Kuo Z.J. Lai H.L.

Brain Res. 2003; 111: 61-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The A2A-R gene contains two independent TATA-less promoters (P1 and P2), which produce transcripts whose 5′-untranslated regions are of different lengths but that encode the same protein (18.Chu Y.Y. Tu K.H. Lee Y.C. Kuo Z.J. Lai H.L. Chern Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19.Lee Y.C. Chang C.W. Su C.W. Lin T.N. Sun S.H. Lai H.L. Chern Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1790-1798PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous study demonstrated that P2 is the major promoter of the A2A-R gene, which is active in various tissues including the brain (19.Lee Y.C. Chang C.W. Su C.W. Lin T.N. Sun S.H. Lai H.L. Chern Y. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1790-1798PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Lee Y.C. Chien C.L. Sun C.N. Huang C.L. Huang N.K. Chiang M.C. Lai H.L. Lin Y.S. Chou S.Y. Wang C.K. Tai M.H. Liao W.L. Lin T.N. Liu F.C. Chern Y. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 1786-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One of the physiological functions of A2A-Rs is to protect cells against various assaults. By using PC12 as a neuron-like model system, we demonstrated that atypical protein kinase Cs function downstream of protein kinase A (PKA) to mediate the protective effect of the A2A-R against apoptosis evoked by serum withdrawal in PC12 cells (23.Huang N.K. Lin Y.W. Huang C.L. Messing R.O. Chern Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13838-13846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition, A2A-R stimulation rescued the blockage of nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth when the nerve growth factor-evoked mitogen-activated protein cascade was suppressed (6.Li S.H. Cheng A.L. Zhou H. Lam S. Rao M. Li H. Li X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1277-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Moreover, stimulation of the A2A-R was found to delay apoptosis in human neutrophils (24.Walker B.A. Rocchini C. Boone R.H. Ip S. Jacobson M.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 2926-2931PubMed Google Scholar) and to protect the hippocampus from excitotoxicity and the liver and kidney from ischemic injury (25.Day Y.J. Huang L. McDuffie M.J. Rosin D.L.

Okusa M.D. Linden J. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: G285-G293Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The role of the A2A-R in HD therefore has also attracted much attention in the past few years (27.Popoli P. Pezzola A. Reggio R. Caporali M.G. Scotti de Carolis A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 257: R5-R6Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 28.Popoli P. Pintor A. Domenici M.R. Frank C. Tebano M.T. Pezzola A. Scarchilli L. Quarta D. Reggio R. Malchiodi-Albedi F.

Neurochem. 2004; 88: 538-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Specifically, activation of the A2A-R appears to exhibit a dual effect on striatal neurodegeneration caused by a mitochondrial toxin (3-nitropropionic acid) (29.Blum D. Galas M.C. Pintor A. Brouillet E. Ledent C. Muller C.E. Bantubungi K. Galluzzo M. Gall D. Cuvelier L. Rolland A.S. Popoli P. Schiffmann S.N. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5361-5369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aberrant amplification of A2A-R signaling has also been demonstrated in striatal cells and in peripheral blood cells expressing mutant Htt (31.Varani K. Abbracchio M.P. Cannella M. Cislaghi G. Giallonardo P. Mariotti C. Cattabriga E. Cattabeni F. Borea P.A. Squitieri F. Cattaneo E. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 2148-2150PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Varani K. Rigamonti D. Sipione S. Camurri A. Borea P.A. Cattabeni F. Abbracchio M.P. Cattaneo E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1245-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because expression of the striatal A2A-R is markedly reduced during the progression of HD (15.Ferre S. O'Connor W.T. Fuxe K. Ungerstedt U. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 5402-5406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Glass M. Dragunow M. Faull R.L. Neuroscience. 2000; 97: 505-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 33.Wyttenbach A. Swartz J. Kita H. Thykjaer T. Carmichael J. Bradley J. Brown R. Maxwell M. Schapira A. Orntoft T.F. Kato K. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 1829-1845Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), there is still controversy as to whether the A2A-R can serve as a therapeutic target for HD. In the present study, we investigated regulation of the A2A-R gene in the presence of mutant Htt with poly(Q) expansion; we found that mutant Htt suppressed the P2 core promoter activity of the A2A-R gene. In addition, activation of the A2A-R reversed the suppressive effect of mutant Htt through a PKA/CREB-mediated pathway. Reagents—All reagents were purchased from Sigma except where specified. Forskolin, 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5′-N-ethylcarboxy-amidoadenosine (CGS21680; CGS), and 8-(3-chlorostyryl) caffeine (CSC) were purchased from Research Biochemical (Natick, MA). DMEM, fetal bovine serum, and horse serum were purchased from Invitrogen. H-89 and KT5720 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Constructs—The human Htt exon1 fragment of a normal allele containing the 25 CAG repeat ((Q)25) and that of a mutant Htt allele harboring the 158 CAG repeat ((Q)158) were amplified from genomic DNAs collected from HEK293 cells and a transgenic HD mouse model (R6/2) (34.Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2535) Google Scholar), respectively, by PCR using the following primers: 5′-GGACTGCCGTGCCGGGCGGGAGACCG-3′ and 5′-TCGGTGCAGCGGCTCCTCAGCCA-CAG-3′. Fragments were subcloned into the pcDNA3.1/V5-His vector using a TOPO-TA expression kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The resultant constructs were designated pcDNA3.1-Htt-(Q)25 and pcDNA3.1-Htt-(Q)158, respectively. The hrGFP cDNA fragment of Vitality® humanized GFP (hrGFP) was removed from the Vitality® hrGFP vector by digestion with NheI/SacI and was subcloned into the NotI site of pcDNA3.1-Htt-(Q)n constructs to produce constructs encoding an N-terminal fragment of Htt with the indicated number of poly(Q) residues fused to hrGFP (designated Htt-(Q)n-hrGFP). Because of the instability of the CAG repeat in bacteria, three pcDNA3.1-Htt-(Q)n-hrGFP constructs containing different numbers of CAG repeats (48, 73, and 109) were created while subcloning the original pcDNA3.1-Htt-(Q)158-hrGFP construct. The pGL2-luciferase reporter constructs, which contain various lengths of the promoter fragment of the rat A2A-R gene, and the CREB-VP16 construct were created as described elsewhere (6.Li S.H.

DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The pRL-SV40 and pRL-TK constructs were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The pCMV-β-galactosidase was from Clontech. The expression constructs, which encode a dominant negative S133A-CREB mutant (CREBm1), and a dominant negative CREBR287L mutant, as well as the A2A-R promoter constructs are described elsewhere (18.Chu Y.Y. Tu K.H. Lee Y.C. Kuo Z.J. Lai H.L. Chern Y. DNA Cell Biol. 1996; 15: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35.Chen W. Yu Y.L. Lee S.F. Chiang Y.J. Chao J.R. Huang J.H. Chiong J.H. Huang C.J. Lai M.Z. Yang-Yen H.F. Yen J.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4636-4646Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Promoter constructs harboring mutations at the CRE site (-246 to -241; TCCAGG) were created by PCR using pGL2-A2AR-250/-145 as the template together with the indicated sense primer (M2, 5′-AACATAACCCTCTTGCCCGGTATC-3′; M4, 5′-AACATAACCCTCTTGACCTGTATC-3′; M6, 5′-AACATAACCCTCTTGAACTTTATC-3′) and the same antisense primer (5′-CTTTATGTTTTTGGCGTCTTCCA-3′). The resultant PCR products were then subcloned into pGL2-Basic (Promega) following the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations of these promoter constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All plasmids used in the transient transfection experiments were prepared by CsCl gradient purification. Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) plus 10% horse serum (Invitrogen) in an incubation chamber gassed with 10% CO2, 90% air at 37 °C. A123 is a PKA-deficient variant of PC12 cells (36.Ginty D.D. Glowacka D. DeFranco C. Wagner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15325-15333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Dr. J. A. Wagner (Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY). A123 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% (v/v) horse serum and 10% (v/v) FBS. Cells were grown on tissue culture plates coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma). The day before transfection, cells were seeded onto a 35-mm dish at a density of 2 × 105 cells per well. For transfection, cells were grown in wells for 24 h and then exposed to a mixture of 3 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (LF2000, Invitrogen) and 2 μg of the desired DNAs for 5 h in serum-free DMEM. Next, cells were washed with PBS, followed by one more wash with normal growth medium, and were cultured as described above for another 48 h before the indicated drug treatment(s) for an additional 24 h. Primary striatal neuron cultures were prepared from brains of E19 SD rats. Briefly, tissues were minced and treated with trypsin (0.1%, Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C. Cells were mechanically dissociated by gentle pipetting in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and seeded onto poly-l-lysine-coated 24-well plates (Nunc) at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. After a 3-h incubation, the culture medium was replaced with B27 Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 200 mm glutamine, 10 mm glutamate, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were cultured in an incubation chamber gassed with 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. For transfection, cells 7 days in vitro were transfected with LF2000 (5 μl) and 2 μg of DNAs for 5 h in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). Cells were washed with PBS once and fresh B27 medium once and were incubated for another 72 h. Immunostaining of an astrocyte marker (glial fibrillary acidic protein) indicated that the neuronal cultures were free of astrocytes (data not shown). Immunofluorescence—Seventy two hours after transfection, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized by 0.05% Nonidet P-40 in PBS at room temperature three times for 20 min each time. After a 1-h blocking in 2% PBS, bovine serum albumin, 2% normal goat serum, cells were stained with the desired primary antibody reconstituted in PBS, 2% goat serum at 4 °C for 14–16 h. Dilution of the anti-MAP2 antibody (Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) was 1:500. The anti-Htt antibody was raised against the first 17 amino acids of human Htt plus two glutamine residues and was utilized at a dilution of 1:500. After extensive washing, the slides were incubated with the corresponding secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa Red (1:500; Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by washing, and analysis with the aid of a laser confocal microscope (Bio-Rad, MRC-1000). Measurement of Mutant Htt Aggregate Formation—For measuring aggregate formation, cells were transfected with the indicated pcDNA3.1-Htt-(Q)n-hrGFP construct and incubated for 3 days. Cells with green fluorescence were identified and counted under a confocal laser fluorescence microscope (MRC-1000, Bio-Rad). Percentages of cells containing visible fluorescent aggregates were quantified. Approximately 100 transfected cells were counted. Data points represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Luciferase Assays—Seventy two hours post-transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in the Cell Culture Lysis Buffer of the Dualluciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). Lysates were then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min to remove insoluble materials. Luciferase activities of 10 μl of lysate were determined following the manufacturer's protocol using a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Promega). Results were obtained by using at least two different preparations of plasmids. The protein concentrations of lysates were determined by the Bradford analysis (37.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211805) Google Scholar), and the luciferase activities were normalized to the amount of proteins in the lysate. At least three independent transfections were performed for each experiment. Galactosidase Detection—To determine the expression of β-galactosidase in the transfected cells, cells were first lysed in the Cell Culture Lysis Buffer (Promega). After low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was collected to determine the activity of β-galactosidase using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside as the substrate by measuring the absorbance of the product at 420 nm with a spectrophotometer. The β-galactosidase activity was linear with time for A420 values up to 1. Western Blot Analysis—Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-PAGE by using 10% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (38.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205487) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were electroblotted onto Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS and incubated with an anti-CBP antibody (1:1000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-CREB antibody (1:2000 dilution; UpState, Charlottesville, VA), anti-phosphorylated CREB antibody (1:1000 dilution; UpState), or anti-lamin antibody (1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight followed by the corresponding secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and recorded using Kodak XAR-5 films. Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting—Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS to a final density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and filtered through a nylon membrane to remove cell aggregates. Flow cytometry and sorting of hrGFP-positive cells were performed using a FACSVantage (BD Biosciences) with a 530 ± 15-nm bandpass filter as they traversed the beam of an argon ion laser (488 nm, 100 milliwatts). Data acquisition and analysis were performed with Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Sorted cells were harvested into tubes for further isolation of total RNA or protein. RNA Isolation and Quantitative Real Time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using the TriReagent kit (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH), treated with RNase-free DNase (RQ1; Promega) to remove the potential contamination of genomic DNA, and transcribed into cDNA using Superscript* II reverse transcriptase. Real time quantitative PCR was performed using the TaqMan kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on a TaqMan ABI 7700 Sequence Detection System (PE Applied Biosystems) using a heat-activated TaqDNA polymerase (Amplitaq Gold; PE Applied Biosystems). The PCR mixtures were incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min, and then 40 PCR cycles were conducted (95 °C for 15 s and 65 °C for 1 min). The sequences of primers are listed below: for A2A-R (the target gene), 5′-TCGCCTGTTTTGTCCTGC-3′ and 5′-ATTCATGGGCACCACGTCC-TCGAAC-3′; for Bcl-2 (the target gene), 5′-CATGCTGGGGCCGTACAG-3′ and 5′-GAACCGGCACCTGCACAC-3′; and for GAPDH (the reference gene), 5′-TATCCGTTGTGGATCTGACAT-3′ and 5′ACA-ACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTA-3′. Independent reverse transcription-PCRs were performed using the same cDNA for both the target gene and reference gene. A melting curve was created at the end of the PCR cycle to confirm that a single product was amplified. Data were analyzed by the ABI 7700 operating software to determine the threshold cycle (CT) above the background for each reaction. The relative transcript amount of the target gene, which was calculated using standard curves of serial RNA dilutions, was normalized to that of GAPDH of the same RNA. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Cells (5 × 106) were washed with 1× PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.6 mm KCl, 9.5 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.4 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.4)), suspended in 500 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes (pH 8), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40), and homogenized by Dounce strokes five times in buffer A. After centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 1 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected into new tubes and then centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was then resuspended in 200 μl of buffer B (20 mm Hepes (pH 8), 425 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 80 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 20 mm NaF, 100 nm okadaic acid, and 25% glycerol) and incubated for 60 min on ice. Nuclear extracts were next collected by centrifugation at 14,500 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts in the supernatant was measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Electrophoretic Gel Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The double-stranded DNA fragment comprising the core promoter region of the A2A-R gene (-250 to -145) was generated by excising the indicated DNA fragment from the core-promoter construct (pGL2-[-250/-145]) with BstXI and NheI. DNA fragments harboring the desired mutations at the CRE sites were prepared by using PCR as described above. The control DNA fragment (B-120) of 120 bp was generated by excising pGL2-Basic with EcoRI and XcmI. The excised DNA fragments were separated and purified from 1.2% DNA gels. The double-stranded oligonucleotides of 20 bp containing the wild type (WT) or mutated CRE were prepared by annealing two complementary oligonucleotides under the following conditions: 88 °C for 2 min, 65 °C for 10 min, 37 °C for 10 min, 25 °C for 25 min, and 4 °C for 15 min. The sequences of oligonucleotides are listed below: for wild type, 5′-ACTCTCTCTTTCCAGGTATC-3′ and 5′-GATACCTGGAAAGAGAGAGT-3′; for M4, 5′-ACTCTCTCTTGACCTGTATC-3′ and 5′-GATACAGGTCAAGAGAGAGT-3′; and for M6, 5′-ACTCTCTCTTGAACTTTATC-3′ and 5-GATAAAGTTCAAGAGAGAGT-3′. The sequence of an irrelevant 20-bp control oligonucleotide (B-20) is 5′-TACCGAGCTCTTACGCGTGC-3′ and 5′-CGTGCGCATTCTCGAGCCAT-3′. The labeled probes (2.5 × 104 cpm) were incubated with nuclear extract (5 μg) and poly(dI)-poly(dC) (2 μg) in a reaction buffer (3 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 3.2 mm KCl, 0.02 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.16 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol). Reactions were incubated on ice for 10 min and loaded onto an 8 or a 6% native polyacrylamide gel for the 105- or 20-bp DN"

Structural information on peptides bound to LPS can lead to the development of more effective endotoxin neutralizers. Short linear antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing peptide LF11, based on the human lactoferrin, binds to LPS, inducing a peptide fold with a “T-shaped” arrangement of a hydrophobic core and two clusters of basic residues that match the distance between the two phosphate groups of LPS. Side chain arrangement of LF11 bound to LPS extends the previously proposed LPS binding pattern, emphasizing the importance of both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in a defined geometric arrangement. In anionic micelles, the LF11 forms amphipathic conformation with a smaller hydrophobic core than in LPS, whereas in zwitterionic micelles, the structure is even less defined. Protection of tryptophan fluorescence quenching in the order SDS>LPS>DPC and hydrogen exchange protection indicates the decreasing extent of insertion of the N terminus and potential role of peptide plasticity in differentiation between bacterial and eukaryotic membranes.

Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PmxB, polymyxin B; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect; TRNOE, transferred nuclear Overhauser effect; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; LTA, lipoteichoic acid; DPC, dodecylphosphocholine. is one of the most potent inducers of the innate immune response. In contrast to the adaptive immune system, innate immunity engaging “pattern recognition receptors” recognizes the conserved motif of molecules characteristic for the pathogens. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns, rather than highly variable strain-specific molecules, allow recognition and response to the broad range of pathogens. Recognition of various forms of LPS from different strains of Gram-negative bacteria, where the lipid A moiety represents the pathogen-associated molecular pattern, triggers the signaling cascade, resulting in release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, as well as small molecules, such as lipid mediators and reactive oxygen species (1Cohen J. Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2179) Google Scholar). In advanced stages of sepsis, when the immune response is overstimulated and deregulated, the pathological consequences are so diverse (ranging from hypotension to intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure) that treatment of a single target, such as tumor necrosis factor α, is insufficient. Sepsis claims each year more than 200,000 lives in the United States alone. Mortality of patients with sepsis is still above 30% and higher in the elderly (2Angus D.C. Linde-Zwirble W.T. Lidicker J. Clermont G. Carcillo J. Pinsky M.R. Crit. Care Med. 2001; 29: 1303-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar), in large extent due to the lack of the effective treatment of the underlying pathology. The preferable treatment, at early stages of sepsis, or prevention, in the case of high risk of sepsis, might be to combine antimicrobial activity to destroy bacteria with neutralization of endotoxin to prevent its interaction with serum and cellular receptors (such as LBP, CD14, and the MD2/TLR4 complex (3Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2632) Google Scholar)), which directly recognize endotoxin and initiate the immune response. The small cyclic lipopeptide polymyxin B (PmxB) is the prototype peptide capable of neutralizing LPS (4Rifkind D. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1463-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Due to its nephrotoxic and neurotoxic effect, its application is limited to topical use. Structural information on the interaction of peptides and receptor proteins with LPS is required for the improved design of anti-endotoxic drugs. Because of the heterogeneity of LPS and its aggregational properties (5Brandenburg K. Mayer H. Koch M.H. Weckesser J. Rietschel E.T. Seydel U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 218: 555-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), structural studies of LPS have rarely been successful. The only precise structural information of LPS interacting with a protein originates from the crystal structure of the Escherichia coli iron uptake receptor protein FhuA, which is an integral membrane protein and has been fortuitously crystallized in complex with an LPS molecule (6Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Based on this complex, a three-dimensional structural pattern has been proposed consisting of the geometric arrangement of cationic side chains, to which many of the proteins known to interact with LPS adhere (7Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The structure of PmxB in its LPS-bound conformation has been determined (8Pristovšek P. Kidrič J. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) using the transferred nuclear Overhauser effect (TRNOE) (9Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 402-417Google Scholar). The TRNOE occurs in the case of weak binding of a smaller ligand (in this case, peptide) to a large molecule or assembly (in this case, LPS aggregate or micelle); the cross-relaxation in the bound species is much larger than in the free ligand and is transferred to the latter through chemical exchange. The intramolecular NOEs of the bound ligand therefore occur at the resonance frequencies of the free ligand and allow the determination of the bound state conformation of the peptide from the intramolecular NOE interactions between ligand protons. Accurate peptide structures can be determined with relatively few NOE interactions when the interactions occur between non-neighboring residues (10Eisenmesser E.Z. Zabell A.P. Post C.B. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Lactoferrin, an iron binding glycoprotein, and its N-terminal peptide fragments neutralize LPS and have antimicrobial activity (11Arnold R.R. Cole M.F. McGhee J.R. Science. 1977; 197: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 12Bellamy W. Takase M. Wakabayashi H. Kawase K. Tomita M. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1992; 73: 472-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The N-terminal segment of lactoferrin adopts the α-helical conformation in integral lactoferrin, whereas the cleaved 25-residue peptide, stabilized by a disulfide bridge, folds into a hairpin structure (13Hwang P.M. Zhou N. Shan X. Arrowsmith C.H. Vogel H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4288-4298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A six-residue (RRWQWR) peptide fragment with the sequence of bovine lactoferrin has been shown to form a structured cluster of aromatic side chains in SDS micelles (14Schibli D.J. Hwang P.M. Vogel H.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 213-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). However, attempts to determine the structure of lactoferricin or any other LPS-neutralizing peptide of eukaryotic origin in complex with LPS have not been successful. To identify the structural pattern of LPS binding and selectivity for disrupting the bacterial membranes, we have determined the solution structure of LF11, an 11-residue peptide based on human lactoferrin that can neutralize LPS and has antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative, as well as Gram-positive, bacteria (15Odell E.W. Sarra R. Foxworthy M. Chapple D.S. Evans R.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 16Majerle A. Kidrič J. Jerala R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 51: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Solution NMR structures of LF11 were determined in complex with LPS using the TRNOE and in anionic (SDS) and zwitterionic (DPC) micelles. 2NMR assignments have been made to the BioMagResBank under accession code 6437. Each lipid environment leads to the conformational adaptation of the peptide from a disordered structure in solution, governed by the constraints imposed by each type of environment. Differences in lipid composition between the bacterial and eukaryotic membrane allow the specificity of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides. Those particular structural requirements on the peptide can be used for the design of more potent endotoxin-neutralizing agents, whereas the adaptation of the peptide for interaction with anionic lipids is important for understanding the antimicrobial activity. Peptide Preparation—The peptide LF11 (FQWQRNIRKVR-NH2) was synthesized by the W. M. Keck facility at Yale University using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)) method. The peptide was purified using high pressure liquid chromatography and verified by mass spectroscopy. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The intrinsic peptide fluorescence was measured in a luminescence spectrometer LS55 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 25 °C in a quartz cuvette of 1-cm path length. Excitation wavelength was 280 nm and excitation and emission slit widths, 5 nm. Fluorescence quenching was performed at increasing concentrations of acrylamide added to the sample. The fluorescence-quenching data were analyzed according to the Stern-Volmer equation Fo/F = 1 + Ksv [Q], where Fo and F are the integrated fluorescence intensities in the absence or presence of quenchers, respectively, Ksv is the collisional Stern-Volmer constant, and [Q] is the acrylamide concentration. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy—The sample of free LF11 was prepared by dissolving lyophilized peptide in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5, and 8% D2O. The final peptide concentration was 2 mm. LF11 with LPS was prepared by adding 25 μl of 10 mg/ml LPS (E. coli serotype 055:B5) stock solution to 1.5 mg of LF11. The ratio between peptide and LPS was 20:1. Samples with LF11 in the micellar environment were prepared at 200 mm SDS-d25 and 240 mm DPC-d38, obtaining thus an excess of micelle concentration relative to the peptide, assuming that 62 molecules of SDS and 54 molecules of DPC form an SDS and DPC micelle, respectively. The pH was adjusted to 5.5. Spectra were recorded at 30 °C on a Varian Unity INOVA 600-MHz spectrometer equipped with z gradients and a triple resonance probe. Two-dimensional homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy and NOESY spectra were acquired with 2048 × 512 data points and spectral widths of 8000 Hz in both dimensions, with 48–64 transients. Total correlation spectra were recorded at mixing times of 10 (for COSY-type information) and 70–100 ms. NOESY spectra were recorded at mixing times of 80 and 150 ms. Water suppression was achieved using WET (17Smallcomb S.H. Patt S.L. Keifer P.A. J. Magn. Reson. (A). 1995; 117: 295-303Crossref Scopus (545) Google Scholar) or WATERGATE (18Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3539) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed using Felix 2000.1 (Accelrys). Resolution enhancement was achieved by apodization of the free induction decay with a shifted square sine-bell window function. Chemical shifts were referenced to the internal standard 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate. Semiautomatic NOE assignment with calibration of volumes and conversion of volumes into DYANA software restraints for upper bounds was achieved using the in-house program nmr2st (19Pristovšek P. Ruterjans H. Jerala R. J. Comput. Chem. 2002; 23: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The presence of NOE intensities from the free peptide was taken into account by reducing the weight given to intraresidual and sequential peaks observed in the reference spectrum of LF11 in the absence of LPS or micelles. Two well resolved geminal methylene proton cross-peaks of N6 and W3 were used for calibration. The experimental distance constraints were then employed to generate peptide conformers using 6000 steps of simulated annealing in torsion angle space implemented in the program DYANA, version 1.5 (20Güntert P. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). 10–20 structures with the lowest target function of 100 calculated structures were kept for further minimization. The DISCOVER program (Accelrys) using the cvff force field (21Dauber-Osguthorpe P. Roberts V.A. Osguthorpe D.J. Wolff J. Genest M. Hagler A.T. Proteins. 1988; 4: 31-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1951) Google Scholar) was used to energy minimize the structures. The quality of structures was checked with PROCHECK NMR (22Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). Structures were visualized and analyzed with INSIGHTII (Accelrys) and MOLMOL software (23Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6498) Google Scholar). For H+-D+ exchange experiments, lyophilized peptide was dissolved in D2O solution of perdeurated SDS (DPC) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, and the one-dimensional spectra were measured at time points up to 360 min. 5-Doxyl stearic acid was used as a paramagnetic probe to examine depth of insertion of the peptide in SDS and DPC micelles. Stock solution of doxyl stearic acid in deuterated methanol was added to a concentration of 2 mm, and pH was adjusted to a range of 5.35–5.5. Intensities of HN-Hα cross-peaks in two-dimensional NOESY spectra (mixing time of 80 ms) were measured. The relative cross-peak height (RA) was evaluated as a ratio of cross-peak heights in the presence and absence of the paramagnetic reagent, normalized so that the least affected cross-peak had the amplitude of 100%. The dissociation rate constant was determined using the CPMG-T2 (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill-T2) experiment, with presaturation for water suppression (24Davis D.G. Perlman M.E. London R.E. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 105: 266-275Crossref Scopus (269) Google Scholar) on LF11 samples and with added LPS at the LPS/peptide molar ratios of 1/10 and 1/30. Spectra were recorded at d2 delays of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, and 3200 μs. A shifted square sine-bell window function was used for apodization. Peak intensities had strictly exponential decay under all peptide/lipopolysaccharide ratios. Relaxation rates were fitted to the following equation, R2CPMG=R20+pfpb(δω)2kex(1−2kextcptanh[kextcp2])(Eq. 1) where kex = 1/τb (τb is the average lifetime in the bound state), dω is the chemical shift difference, pf and pb are mole fractions of free and bound peptide, respectively, and tcp is the 180–180° interpulse interval. Peptide Docking to LPS—The coordinates of the lipid A portion of LPS from 1QFF (7Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (183) Google Scholar) (including two 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate residues) and the bound conformations of LF11 obtained from NMR refinement were used for molecular docking calculations with the program AutoDock (25Goodsell D.S. Morris G.M. Olson A.J. J. Mol. Recognit. 1996; 9: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). The peptide backbone was kept rigid, whereas all side chains were defined as flexible, using the deftors module; lipid A was treated as the macromolecule part of the docking calculation and was therefore kept rigid. The AutoGrid calculation was run with 100 points (separated by 0.325 Å) in each spatial dimension, with the grid centered at the H-2 atom of the GlcN II residue of the lipid A moiety. The AutoDock calculation was run using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm using a translation step of 0.2 Å, a quaternion step of 5.0°, and a torsion step (tstep) of 5.0°. In the analysis step, 10 of the generated docked structures were evaluated. Structure of LF11 Bound to Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide— LF11 has antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (15Odell E.W. Sarra R. Foxworthy M. Chapple D.S. Evans R.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), binds to the LPS, and is able to neutralize the biological activity of LPS in the in vitro LAL (limulus amoebocyte lysate) test and in monocytes (16Majerle A. Kidrič J. Jerala R. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2003; 51: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). LF11 does not form any detectable persistent tertiary structure in solution, as indicated by the absence of long range NOEs in two-dimensional NOESY or ROESY (rotating Overhauser effect spectroscopy) spectra (Fig. 1a). The addition of equimolar amounts of LPS to the mm concentration of the peptide caused precipitation of the LPS-peptide aggregates, preventing determination of the structure in the 1:1 complex. Addition of LPS to the peptide at a molar ratio of 1:20 resulted in an increase of intensity and the appearance of additional NOE cross-peaks in the two-dimensional NOESY spectra because of the TRNOE (Fig. 1b). The latter appears because of the rapid exchange between the LPS-bound and free form of LF11 at acidic pH. CPMG-T2 relaxation experiments were used to obtain the dissociation rate constant koff, resulting in values of 1988 s–1 and 1635 s–1 for peptide/LPS ratios of 10/1 and 30/1, respectively (data not shown). LF11 in complex with LPS forms a well defined conformation, with a backbone r.m.s.d. of 1.3 Å for the residues 2–10 (Fig. 2). The structural definition decreases from the N toward the C terminus with significantly better definition at hydrophobic residues. The heavy atom r.m.s.d. for the four residues forming the hydrophobic core (Phe1, Trp3, Ile7, and Val10, with NOEs connecting Phe1/Trp3, Phe1/Val10, Trp3/Ile7, and Trp3/Val10, respectively) is only 1.8 Å in comparison to the overall heavy atom r.m.s.d. of 3.1 Å (Table I). The peptide forms a planar loop with a turn at the residues Gln4–Ile7. The side chains of Gln4/Arg5/Asn6 and Arg8/Lys9/Arg11, respectively, form two hydrophilic clusters attached to the hydrophobic core. The side chains of Phe1, Trp3, and Ile7 are positioned in a nearly linear fashion and perpendicular to the line connecting the two hydrophilic clusters, forming the shape of the letter T with a hydrophobic vertical line and hydrophilic tips of the horizontal line. Trp3 is the central residue of the hydrophobic core, contributing 30 inter-residual NOEs extending to side chains of Phe1, Ile7, and Val10.Table IStructural statistics of LF11 in different types of amphiphillic environmentStructural statistics of LF11 ensembleLPSSDSDPCDistance restraintsTotal NOE1097948Intraresidual493119Sequential (|i — j|= 1)373623Non-sequential (|i — j|> 1)23126Structure statisticsMean and max. violations (Å)0.02, 0.390.03, 0.490.01, 0.21Average pairwise r.m.s.d. among refined structures (Å)Backbone atoms (residues 2-10)1.25 ± 0.501.66 ± 0.602.32 ± 0.47Heavy atoms (residues 2-10)3.09 ± 0.853.58 ± 1.034.62 ± 0.97Ramachandran plot qualityResidues in the most favored regions (%)62.528.632.9Residues in additional allowed regions (%)33.355.764.3Residues in generously allowed regions (%)3.315.72.9Residues in disallowed regions (%)000 Open table in a new tab Docking of the peptide to LPS suggests that the two phosphate groups of the lipid A moiety are positioned close to the guanidino groups of Arg5 and Arg1, respectively, with the separation between the two cationic clusters of ∼13 Å, matching the distance between the phosphate groups of the lipid A moiety. Several of the cationic groups in the second cluster (Arg8, Lys9, Arg11) are able to interact favorably with the phosphate group of the lipid A moiety. The guanidino group of Arg8 may also interact with carboxyl groups of the 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate sugar units, which are conserved in the LPS forms of Gram-negative bacteria (Fig. 3). The Trp3 ring is positioned at the interface between the aliphatic chains and polar groups of the LPS layer, whereas the Phe1 side chain is positioned close to the aliphatic side chains approximately at the level of the third carbon methylene group. The 1:1 peptide-LPS complex buries 441 Å2 of surface area (240 Å2 polar and 192 Å2 nonpolar), representing a considerable free energy contribution in addition to the electrostatic interactions. The addition of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) to LF11 also induced a number of TRNOE cross-peaks, indicating that the peptide binds to LTA as well. LTA is a component of the Gram-positive bacterial cell wall and is a weaker stimulant of the immune system than LPS, acting through the TLR2 receptors (26Deininger S. Stadelmaier A. von Aulock S. Morath S. Schmidt R.R. Hartung T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4134-4138Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to LPS, the addition of LTA did not result in a compact structure of LF11, as indicated by the absence of long and medium range NOEs; the bound peptide structure therefore did not converge in the model building. Structure of LF11 in SDS and DPC Micelles—LF11 bound to added SDS and DPC micelles as indicated by a large decrease of T2 value, corresponding to increased correlation time. In SDS micelles, LF11 folds into a well defined loop with a backbone atom r.m.s.d. of the ensemble of 1.7 Å. The hydrophobic peptide core is packed in a similar arrangement as in complex with LPS, involving Trp3 sandwiched between Phe1 and Ile7 (according to NOEs between Phe1/Trp3 and Trp3/Ile7, respectively), whereas Val10 does not show any non-trivial NOEs and obviously does not participate in the hydrophobic core. The structural definition is enhanced by NOEs between Trp3-Hϵ1 and the main chain (HN and Hα) of Arg5. The four basic residues are grouped on top of the molecule with their charged side chains resembling the ribs of an umbrella, with the hydrophobic N terminus forming its handle (Fig. 4). In DPC micelles, the structure of LF11 is less defined than in the former two cases; it preserves the hydrophobic core of the Phe1, Trp3, and Ile7; however, the arrangement of their side chains is less linear. Trp3 interacts with Phe1 and Ile7 but not with Val10, as in SDS micelles; however, the contact between residues 3 and 5 is missing. Local r.m.s.d. of LPS and SDS structures displays lower values at positions of hydrophobic residues Phe1, Trp3, Ile7, and also Val10 and higher at hydrophilic loops. Particularly Ile7 is less flexible in LPS in comparison to SDS structure, because it interacts with Val10 in the former structure. In DPC structure, the average displacement is lower at Gln2, Ile6, and also Val10 but higher at Trp3 in comparison to the SDS structure. Localization of the Peptide in Micelles—Positioning of LF11 in micelles was investigated by fluorescence quenching, hydrogen exchange, and line broadening due to the interaction with a lipid probe with a paramagnetic group. Fluorescence quenching indicates that, in the presence of LPS, Trp3 becomes protected from quenching (KSV = 4.3 m–1; for comparison in the free peptide, KSV = 19.3 m–1). Tryptophan was most significantly protected in SDS micelles (KSV = 2.0 m–1), whereas significantly lower protection was observed in DPC micelles (KSV = 8.4 m–1, Fig. 5). Protection from solvent in SDS is extended to Arg5, according to the chemical shift of its HN that is downfield shifted to 7.18 parts/million (compared with 8.04 in DPC micelles). Arg5-HN is oriented toward the hydrophobic core, as indicated also by its NOE contact with Trp3-Hϵ1. In SDS micelles, the amide group of Gln2 could be observed in the hydrogen exchange experiment for >2 h (exchange constant 0.029 ± 0.001 min–1, data not shown) and is therefore protected from hydrogen exchange in contrast to DPC, where complete hydrogen exchange occurred within the dead time of our hydrogen exchange experiment (a few minutes). Further characterization of positioning in micelles was determined by the paramagnetic line-broadening reagent 5-doxyl-stearic acid with a paramagnetic group at position 5 where it is expected to be close to the level of phosphate groups of phospholipids (27Damberg P. Jarvet J. Graslund A. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 271-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), which is appropriate for the shallow burial of a short peptide. In both SDS and DPC micelles, the intraresidual cross-peaks showed differential line broadening upon addition of 5-doxyl stearic acid. In SDS, the lowest line broadening occurred at positions Arg5, Val10, and Arg11 and the highest at positions Gln2 and Asn6 (Phe1 HN is not observable). This suggests penetration into the upper region of the lipid layer by the N terminus of the peptide and exposure of the C-terminal residues. In DPC, Arg5 and Lys9 are the least affected, whereas the largest decrease is observed at Gln2 and Asn6, also indicating the interaction of the hydrophobic N terminus with the lipid interior. Structural Conservation of the LPS Binding Motif—Structural investigation of the antimicrobial and endotoxin-neutralizing peptide LF11 in different amphiphillic environments was aimed at understanding the structural basis of neutralization of LPS and differentiation between bacterial and eukaryotic membranes. We have compared the structure of the LF11-LPS complex with the FhuA-LPS complex (Protein Data Bank code 1QFF), the only determined protein structure with bound LPS, where the membrane protein FhuA interacts with LPS via the side chains of residues from three antiparallel β strands (6Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Despite a completely different backbone fold, the side chains of LF11 interacting with LPS correspond quite well to those of FhuA when the LPS molecules of both complexes are superimposed (Fig. 6), i.e. Arg5 of LF11 corresponds to Lys439 of FhuA, Lys9 to Lys351, Arg11 to Lys351, and Phe1 to Phe355, respectively, with a side chain r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å. The structural LPS binding motif based on the complex between FhuA and LPS has been previously proposed, comprising four basic residues (Lys306, Lys351, Arg382, and Lys439 of FhuA) in a defined geometric arrangement, allowing for Lys/Arg replacements (7Ferguson A.D. Welte W. Hofmann E. Lindner B. Holst O. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 585-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (183) Google Scholar). This proposed motif was limited to electrostatic interactions involving the polar head group of LPS, particularly the pair of phosphates, and neglects the interaction with hydrophobic residues that participate in the recognition and biological activity of LPS. Indeed fatty acid chains are essential for the biological activity of LPS, and the number and type of acyl chains significantly affect the recognition and ensuing biological activity of LPS (28Rietschel E.T. Kirikae T. Schade F.U. Mamat U. Schmidt G. Loppnow H. Ulmer A.J. Zahringer U. Seydel U. Di Padova F. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar). In the FhuA-LPS structure, a layer of hydrophobic residues next to the layer of cationic residues interacts with the fatty acid chains of LPS. The above mentioned spatial fit of Phe1 of LF11 to Phe355 in FhuA indicates that hydrophobic residues are, in fact, conserved and should be included in the improved definition of the structural LPS binding motif (29Pristovšek P. Kidrič J. Matsoukas J. Mavromoustakos T. Drug Discovery and Design. IOS Press, Amsterdam2002: 161-166Google Scholar). Arg382 of FhuA corresponds to Trp3 of LF11. Tryptophan residue of membrane active proteins and peptides frequently interact with phospholipids at the level of carbonyl groups (30de Planque M.R. Kruijtzer J.A. Liskamp R.M. Marsh D. Greathouse D.V. Koeppe R.E. de Kruijff B. Killian J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20839-20846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Trp3 of LF11 is unique in having a dual role of interacting with LPS and at the same time serving as the key residue to organize the peptide fold by interacting with other hydrophobic residues. Polypeptide fold of PmxB is restricted by cyclization and in larger proteins by the packing of secondary structure elements. Side chains of LF11 interacting with LPS also correspond well to residues PmxB-"

RA treatment induces epigenetic modifications at its target loci and restores myeloid differentiation of APL blasts. Using RA-sensitive and RA-resistant APL cell lines and primary blasts, we addressed the functional relevance of the aberrant methylation status at the RA-target promoter RARβ2 and the mechanism by which methylation is reversed by RA. RA decreased DNMT expression and activity, which correlated with demethylation at specific sites on RARβ2 promoter/exon-1, and the ability of APL blasts to differentiate in vitro and in vivo. None of these events occurred in an RA-resistant APL cell line containing a PML-RARα defective for ligand binding. The specific contribution of the HDAC and DNMT pathways to the response of APL cells to RA was also tested by inhibiting these enzymatic activities with TSA and/or 5-azacytidine. In RA-responsive and RA-resistant APL blasts, TSA and 5-azacytidine induced specific changes on the chromatin state at RA-target sites, increased the RA effect on promoter activity, endogenous RA-target gene expression and differentiation. These results extend the rationale for chromatin-targeted treatment in APL and RA-resistant leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W1981619037,"Protein kinase casein kinase II (CK2) is increased in response to diverse growth stimuli, as well as being elevated in many human cancers examined. We have demonstrated that CK2 is a key survival factor that protects human colon carcinoma cells from TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis. We determined that inhibition of CK2 phosphorylation events by DRB (5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole) resulted in dramatic sensitization of tumor cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, in the absence of effects in normal cells. Sensitization was caspase dependent, and independent of regulation via NF-κB. Further, inhibition of phosphorylation by CK2 did not modify the expression level of antiapoptotic proteins. Analysis of TRAIL-induced death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) formation demonstrated enhanced formation of the DISC, enhanced cleavage of caspase-8 and cleavage of Bid in the presence of DRB, thereby facilitating the release of proapoptotic factors from the mitochondria with subsequent downregulation of the expression of XIAP and c-IAP1. Further, silencing of CK2α in HT29 cells following transfection of CK2α shRNA abrogated CK2 kinase activity while simultaneously increasing TRAIL sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that CK2 plays a critical antiapoptotic role by conferring resistance to TRAIL at the level of the DISC."
https://openalex.org/W2012134243,"The FOXO family of Forkhead transcription factors, regulated by the phosphoinositide-3-kinase–Akt pathway, is involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Strong expression of HER2, a receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene, in cancers has been associated with a poor prognosis. Recently, FOXO4 was shown to regulate the transcription of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 gene directly. Also, we have shown that HER2 promotes mitogenic growth and transformation of cancer cells by downregulation of p27 Kip1. Given the fact that FOXO4 mediates p27 transcription, we hypothesize that an Akt phosphorylation mutant of FOXO4 (FOXO4A3), which maintains the activity to transactivate p27 Kip1, may be used as an anticancer agent for HER2-overexpressing cancers. Here, we applied the FOXO4 gene as a novel anticancer agent for HER2-overexpressing cells under the control of a tetracycline (tet)-regulated gene expression system. Overexpression of FOXO4A3 inhibits HER2-activated cell growth. We found that FOXO4A3 inhibited the kinase activity of protein kinase B/Akt and reversed HER2-mediated p27 mislocation in the cytoplasm. FOXO4A3 expression also led to decreased levels of CSN5, a protein involved in p27 degradation. These data suggest that FOXO4A3 also can regulate p27 post-transcriptionally. In addition, we found that FOXO4A3 sensitized cells to apoptosis induced by the chemotherapeutic agent 2-methoxyestradiol. Most significantly for clinical application, FOXO4A3 expression in HER2-overexpressing cells can be regulated in vivo and reduces the tumor volume in a tumor model. These findings indicate the applicability of employing FOXO4 regulation as a therapeutic intervention in HER2-overexpressing cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2099498580,"Telomere dysfunction contributes to reduced cell viability, altered differentiation, and impaired regenerative/proliferative responses. Recent advances indicate that telomerase activity confers a pro-angiogenic phenotype to endothelial cells and their precursors. We have investigated whether telomerase contributes to tissue regeneration following hind limb ischemia and vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (VEGF165) treatment. VEGF delivery induced angiogenesis and increased expression of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and telomerase activity in skeletal muscles and satellite and endothelial cells. Adenovirus-mediated transfer of wild type TERT but not of a dominant negative mutant, TERTdn, significantly induced capillary but not arteriole formation. However, when co-delivered with VEGF, TERTdn abrogated VEGF-dependent angiogenesis, arteriogenesis, and blood flow increase. This effect was paralleled by in vitro evidence that telomerase inhibition by 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine in VEGF-treated endothelial cells strongly reduced capillary density and promoted apoptosis in the absence of serum. Similar results were obtained with adenovirus-mediated expression of TERTdn and AKTdn, both reducing endogenous TERT activity and angiogenesis on Matrigel. Mechanistically, neo-angiogenesis in our system involved: (i) VEGF-dependent activation of telomerase through the nitric oxide pathway and (ii) telomerase-dependent activation of endothelial cell differentiation and protection from apoptosis.

Beyond evidence that VEGF multiple signaling pathways regulate proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells (6Matsumoto T. Claesson-Welsh L. Science's STKE. 2001; (http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sigtrans;2001/53/re21)PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the mechanism(s) by which VEGF promotes angiogenesis in vivo in normal or ischemic tissues. A growing body of literature assigns to telomerase a potentially relevant role in angiogenesis and cardiovascular disorders (7Oh H. Schneider M.D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 717-724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Chang E. Yang J. Nagavarapu U. Herron G.S. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 752-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To date, however, no evidence has linked VEGF and the regulation of the endogenous catalytic subunit (TERT) of telomerase, which is limiting for enzymatic activity. Here, we have investigated the role of telomerase in tissue remodeling after VEGF gene transfer in a rat model of hind limb ischemia. We found that telomerase is an important downstream effector of VEGF-mediated vascularization in vivo involved in the regulation of capillarogenesis. In fact, adenovirus-mediated transfer of the wild type hTERT gene in ischemic rats induced development of new capillaries and reduced apoptosis, indicating a direct contribution of TERT to angiogenesis in vivo. Telomerase activity is required for this process, because delivery of a dominant negative mutant of TERT (TERTdn) failed to promote formation of new capillaries. Most strikingly, when co-delivered with VEGF, the TERTdn completely abrogated VEGF-dependent angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, emphasizing the role of the enzyme in the vascular system. Similarly, the inhibition of endogenous telomerase by 3′-azido-3′-deoxythymidine (AZT) in VEGF-treated cells strongly reduced capillary formation and failed to prevent apoptosis in the absence of growth factors. In addition, the expression of TERTdn or AKTdn reduced the catalytic activity of endogenous telomerase and severely compromised endothelial cell differentiation on Matrigel, supporting a further role of TERT in the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation. Lastly, we obtained evidence as to the mechanism involved in VEGF-dependent angiogenesis by demonstrating that: (i) interference with the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway by inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis prevented the increase of TERT mRNA and telomerase activity in differentiated C2C12 myotubes and in proliferating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and (ii), conversely, the expression of a constitutively active eNOS mutant activated the TERT promoter.

AdhTERT and AdhTERTdn or saline were injected at 10 sites. For all of the experiments, the virus dose was 5 × 107 pfu/animal in 0.5 ml except as indicated when a combination of 5 × 107 pfu/virus for a total of 1 × 108 pfu/animal was used.

Adductor muscles were removed, fixed in formaldehyde for 48 h, and embedded in paraffin. For each sample, 3-μm-tick sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and 90–130 random fields were examined to evaluate capillary density as described previously (1Gowdak L.H. Poliakova L. Wang X.

After paraffin embedding, 3-μm sections from each sample were cut with the muscle fibers oriented in the transverse direction. Thereafter, sections were de-paraffinized, rinsed in PBS, incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with mouse monoclonal anti-α-smooth muscle actin (clone 1A4, Sigma) diluted in 1:30 PBS, and incubated at 37 °C for 60 min with anti-mouse IgG TRITC-labeled antibody diluted 1:60 in PBS. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and embedded in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) mounting medium. For morphometric analysis, the total area of each section was examined at ×400 magnification. In each field, the measurement of arteries and arteriole profile included major and minor luminal diameter length. Specifically, for n profiles counted in an area (A), the length density (Ld) is equal to the sum of the ratio (R) of the major or long axis to the minor or wide axis of each profile according to the formula: Ld = 1/A × ΣR = (R1 + R2 + R3 +........ .Rn)/A. Ultrasonic Transit Time Flowmetry—Blood flow was measured by ultrasonic transit time flowmetry using a Transonic flowmeter (T 106, Transonic Systems Inc.) coupled to a 100-Hz 0.5-V probe calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flowmetry was performed on the residual part of the femoral artery underlying the inguinal ligament in the ischemic limb and on an equivalent portion of the controlateral normoperfused limb. The probe was directly applied on the artery, which was not deflected from its natural course. Space between the vessel and the brackets of the probe was filled with an ultrasonic couplant (HR Lubricating Jelly). Blood flow (ml/min) was measured in both controlateral and ischemic limbs and was expressed as ischemic/controlateral ratio. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.D.

Infection of HUVEC with recombinant adenovirus was performed in PBS+/+ for 45 min at room temperature, and the cells were harvested and seeded on Matrigel. The number of tubular structures from triplicate wells (10 fields/well) was quantified at ×20 magnification after 3–24 h of differentiation. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Statistical Analysis—Continuous variables were analyzed by the Student's t test and one-way ANOVA. Post hoc tests according to the Student-Newman-Keul's method were used when the ANOVA p value indicated a statistically significant difference among groups. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. A value of p < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. VEGF165 Induces Angiogenesis and Up-regulates TERT in Ischemic Rats—Unilateral hind limb ischemia was induced by removal of the femoral artery in male Wistar rats. Consequences of hind limb ischemia in this model have been well characterized (1Gowdak L.H. Poliakova L. Wang X. Kovesdi I. Fishbein K.W. Zacheo A. Palumbo R. Straino S. Emanueli C.

Gene therapy treatment was administered at the time of surgery by intramuscular injection of an adenovector encoding the human isoform of VEGF165 (AdVEGF165) into the adductors and quadriceps of normoperfused (sham-operated) or ischemic rats. Control animals received saline, AdNull, or AdLacZ. As shown in Fig. 1a, VEGF165 gene delivery enhanced capillary density. In treated rats, values were significantly higher than in controls (AdNull) at each time point (3 days, p < 0.0001; 8 days, p < 0.045; and 14 days, p < 0.032). A large body of literature indicates that VEGF regulates the function of mature endothelial cells and mobilizes vascular precursor cells (18Larrivee B. Karsan A. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 447-456PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF also protects vascular cells from apoptosis (19Zachary I. Am. J.

Invasive Cardiol. 2000; 12: 14A-17APubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence shows that a sustained telomerase activity improves cell survival (22Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chiu C.P.

We sought to evaluate whether VEGF165 modulates TERT expression and telomerase activity during a time course of 3, 8, and 14 days in rat skeletal muscles. In the untreated animals, rTERT mRNA expression was low (26Oh H. Taffet G.E. Youker K.A. Entman M.L. Overbeek P.A. Michael L.H. Schneider M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1995; 11: 893-898PubMed Google Scholar) and decreased further after ischemia (Fig. 1b) but was markedly enhanced upon VEGF165 gene delivery at all of the time points (p < 0.01). rTERT mRNA did not increase upon injection of control virus (AdLacZ). Telomerase activity paralleled changes in mRNA level (Fig. 1c). It was low but detectable in the skeletal muscles of normoperfused animals and virtually absent following ischemia but substantially rescued by 3 days of treatment with VEGF165. Expression of the TERT protein was detected (Fig. 1d) in muscle fibers and vascular structures of normoperfused animals but was down-regulated upon ischemia and again substantially rescued by VEGF165 treatment. VEGFRs have been recently detected in non-vascular tissues including regenerating skeletal muscle fibers and satellite cells (5Germani A. Di Carlo A. Mangoni A. Straino S. Giacinti C. Turrini P.

Fleming I. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1104-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To investigate a potential correlation between VEGF activation of satellite muscle cells and of TERT expression, serial muscle sections were immunostained with antibodies for TERT or desmin, a specific marker of activated satellite cells (see Ref. 5Germani A. Di Carlo A. Mangoni A. Straino S. Giacinti C. Turrini P. Biglioli P. Capogrossi M.C. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 1417-1428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar and references therein). Satellite cells of ischemic rats at day 3 after VEGF treatment did co-express TERT and desmin (Fig. 1e), establishing a correlation between telomerase activation and muscle regeneration. Satellite cells in normoperfused or ischemic animals receiving saline or Ad.Null were negative for both markers (data not shown). These results indicate that VEGF165 gene therapy of hind limb ischemia induces TERT expression and function and that this effect is concomitant with the onset of an angiogenic process. Telomerase Induces Angiogenesis in Ischemic Tissues and Protects Them from Apoptosis—We next queried whether the activation of telomerase is essential for VEGF165-dependent angiogenesis in acute hind limb ischemia or is an epiphenomenon devoid of biological significance. To address this point, we examined in vivo the effect of adenovirus-mediated transfer of the hTERT gene on the formation of blood vessels and on blood flow in rat ischemic muscles at 3, 8, and 14 days after injection (Fig. 2). The expression of the transduced gene was monitored by RT-PCR using primers specific for hTERT (Fig. 2a). No induction of the endogenous TERT gene was detected upon infection with AdNull using primers specific for the rat molecule (data not shown). Notably, compared with AdNull, capillary density was enhanced by AdhTERT (Fig. 2b), particularly by 14 days. However, the angiogenic effect of hTERT was more limited than that of VEGF. No significant increase was detected in the formation of arterioles (Fig. 2c) and on blood flow (Fig. 2d) in ischemic animals infected with AdhTERT, whereas both parameters were enhanced by VEGF. In addition, when VEGF was co-delivered with a dominant-negative mutant hTERT (AdhTERTdn), which on its own has no effect on capillary density, VEGF-dependent effects on angiogenesis (Fig. 2a), arteriogenesis (Fig. 2b), and blood flow (Fig. 2c) were abrogated. On the other hand, wild type hTERT was as efficient as or even more so than VEGF in protecting cells from apoptosis (Fig. 2e). All of these observations demonstrate a direct contribution of TERT to the onset of new vessels promoted by VEGF treatment. Telomerase Activity Is Required for the Onset of VEGF-dependent Angiogenesis in Vitro—To further examine the role of TERT in angiogenesis, we measured TERT expression and telomerase activity in differentiated murine myotubes (C2C12) and HUVEC grown in the absence or presence of 50 ng/ml human recombinant VEGF165 (Fig. 3). As expected (24Yang J. Chang E. Cherry A.M. Bangs C.D. Oei Y. Bodnar A. Bronstein A. Chiu C.P. Herron G.S. J. Biol.

VEGF165 strongly induced TERT mRNA expression in both cell types with peak expression at 20–24 h (data not shown). This effect was paralleled by a significant increase in telomerase activity (Fig. 3b). To analyze functionally"

Inhibition by siRNAs to ErbB3 and Akt isoforms 1, 2 and 3 was utilized to investigate the contribution of these molecules to tumor survival, spreading and invasiveness, and the roles of specific Akt isoforms. ErbB3 siRNA stably and dose-dependently suppressed ErbB3 protein for 2 days or more, and reduced cell numbers, by both suppressing cell cycle and causing apoptosis and necrosis. It also inhibited soft agar growth, cell motility and migration, and invasiveness. Akt1, 2 and 3 siRNAs had similar suppressive effects on cell number, apoptosis/necrosis and soft agar growth. However, although Akt1 siRNA had no effect on cell migration or invasion, Akt2 siRNA effectively suppressed both activities, and Akt3 siRNA had moderate effectiveness. In A549 cells, ErbB3 is indicated as having major effects on cell division, survival, motility, migration and invasiveness. All three Akt isoforms are to varying degrees involved in these cell behaviors, with Akt2 especially implicated in migration and invasion. ErbB3 and the Akts are promising targets for therapy, and siRNAs may be useful for this purpose."
https://openalex.org/W1986802053,"Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) entails two principal mechanisms: modification of DNA ends prior to ligation (error-prone rejoining) or precise ligation without modification if the DNA ends are complementary (error-free repair). Error-prone rejoining is mutagenic, because it can lead to destruction of coding sequence or to chromosomal aberrations, and therefore must be tightly regulated. Previous studies on the role of the p53 tumor suppressor in the regulation of NHEJ have yielded conflicting results, but a rigorous analysis of NHEJ proficiency and fidelity in a purely chromosomal context has not been carried out. To this end, we created novel repair plasmid substrates that integrate into the genome. DSBs generated by the I-SceI endonuclease within these substrates were repaired by either error-prone rejoining or precise ligation. We found that the expression of wild-type p53 inhibited any repair-associated DNA sequence deletion, including a more than 250-fold inhibition of error-prone rejoining events compared to p53-null cells, while any promoting effect of p53 on precise ligation could not be directly evaluated. The role of p53 in NHEJ appeared to involve a direct transactivation-independent mechanism, possibly restricting DNA end-modification by blocking the annealing of single strands along flanking stretches of microhomology. The inhibition of error-prone rejoining by p53 did not apply to the rejoining of DSBs induced by ionizing radiation. In conclusion, our data suggest that p53 restricts the mutagenic effects of NHEJ without compromising repair proficiency or cell survival, thereby maintaining genomic stability."

https://openalex.org/W1970892745,"At the end of oogenesis, Xenopus laevis stage VI oocytes are arrested at the G2/M transition (prophase) waiting for progesterone to release the block and begin maturation. Progesterone triggers a cascade of phosphorylation events such as a decrease of pKa and an increase of maturating-promoting factor activity. Progression through meiosis was controlled by the sequential synthesis of several proteins. For instance, the MAPK kinase kinase c-Mos is the very first protein to be produced, whereas cyclin B1 appears only after meiosis I. After the meiotic cycles, the oocyte arrests at metaphase of meiosis II with an elevated c-Mos kinase activity (cytostatic factor). By using a two-hybrid screen, we have identified maskin, a protein involved in the control of mRNA sequential translation, as a binding partner of Aurora-A, a protein kinase necessary for oocyte maturation. Here we showed that, in vitro, Aurora-A directly binds to maskin and that both proteins can be co-immunoprecipitated from oocyte extracts, suggesting that they do associate in vivo. We also demonstrated that Aurora-A phosphorylates maskin on a Ser residue conserved in transforming acidic coiled coil proteins from Drosophila to human. When the phosphorylation of this Ser was inhibited in vivo by microinjection of synthetic peptides that mimic the maskin-phosphorylated sequence, we observed a premature maturation. Under these conditions, proteins such as cyclin B1 and Cdc6, which are normally detected only in meiosis II, were massively produced in meiosis I before the occurrence of the nuclear envelope breakdown. This result strongly suggests that phosphorylation of maskin by Aurora-A prevents meiosis II proteins from being produced during meiosis I.

Stage VI of the first meiotic division is a step of growth and synthesis of mRNA that will be used later for progression of prophase I-arrested oocytes through meiosis I. After GVBD, continued protein synthesis is still necessary to successfully complete meiosis I and to allow the reappearance of the MPF at the onset of meiosis II. The dormant mRNAs, which are synthesized and stored in the growing oocyte, become translationally activated during the completion of meiosis (oocyte maturation). During meiotic maturation, oocytes are transcriptionally repressed, and all necessary proteins are translated from pre-existing, maternally derived mRNAs (3.Fox C.A. Sheets M.D. Wickens M.P. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 2151-2162Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The translation of Mos mRNA is necessary to produce the serine/threonine kinase Mos, a key regulator of oocyte maturation. Mos is a direct activator of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase, which in turn activates MAPK (4.Posada J. Yew N. Ahn N.G. Vande Woude G.F. Cooper J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2546-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Mos protein levels are tightly regulated in vivo during oocyte maturation (5.Sagata N. Oskarsson M. Copeland T. Brumbaugh J.

Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) to induce the MAPK cascade that directly activates the MPF. Mos translational control is exerted through the regulation of Mos mRNA (A) tail in immature oocytes, to which further adenyl residues are added during oocyte maturation (7.McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8.Sheets M.D. Wu M. Wickens M. Nature. 1995; 374: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). This early translation of c-Mos mRNA was reported to be essential for the progesterone-stimulated maturation (9.Mendez R. Hake L.E. Andresson T. Littlepage L.E. Ruderman J.V. Richter J.D. Nature. 2000; 404: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). However, it was recently demonstrated that c-Mos synthesis is not necessary for the entry in meiosis I but is required after meiosis I to proceed to meiosis II in order to induce the cytostatic factor arrest (10.Dupre A. Jessus C. Ozon R. Haccard O. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to Mos, a number of other Xenopus maternal mRNAs are translationally regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation during progesterone-stimulated oocyte maturation. Furthermore, the control of temporal order of the mRNA translation is crucial for oocyte maturation to proceed normally (11.Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 12.Nakajo N. Yoshitome S. Iwashita J. Iida M. Uto K. Ueno S. Okamoto K. Sagata N. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 328-338PubMed Google Scholar). Maternal mRNAs are not translated at the same time but are selectively and sequentially elongated and translated all along oocyte maturation to ensure a timely progression through meiosis I and II and to arrest oocytes at metaphase of meiosis II (13.Hochegger H.

Richter J.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). The mRNAs encoding c-Mos, several cyclins (cyclin B1 and cyclin B4), Cdk, and the enzymes required for DNA replication and chromatin assembly are concerned by this translational control (17.Barkoff A.F. Dickson K.S. Gray N.K. Wickens M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 97-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 18.Charlesworth A. Ridge J.A. King L.A. MacNicol M.C. MacNicol A.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2798-2806Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Prior to the onset of meiotic maturation, these mRNAs possess a relatively short poly(A) tail. Progesterone-stimulated translational control may be divided into three processes as follows: (i) progesterone-initiated signal transduction; (ii) signal amplification; and (iii) mRNA cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation. After progesterone treatment, several of these messages are translationally activated by poly(A) elongation; the poly(A) tail elongates up to about 100 nucleotides, and the mRNAs can thereafter be recruited by the translational machinery (19.Paynton B.V. Bachvarova R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1994; 37: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 20.Osborne H.B. Richter J.D. Prog. Mol. Subcell. Biol. 1997; 18: 173-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Dynamic changes in poly(A) tail length of some of these maternal mRNAs play a crucial role in their ribosome recruitment and temporally regulated pattern of translation (7.McGrew L.L. Dworkin-Rastl E. Dworkin M.B. Richter J.D. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 803-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic polyadenylation is directed by two types of sequence-specific elements in the 3′-untranslated region of these mRNAs: a uracil-rich cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE), and the polyadenylation hexanucleotide sequence AAUAAA (3.Fox C.A.

Cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB) is a protein that binds CPE at the 3′ end of the mRNA. CPEB interacts with maskin, a factor that also associates with the mRNA 5′ cap binding factor eIF4E. The binding of maskin to CPEB and eIF4E induces a loop formation in the mRNA. In Xenopus, the CPEB-maskin-eIF4E complex prevents the translation of mRNAs such as cyclin B1, c-Mos, or Cdc6. When masked, these mRNAs typically have short poly(A) tails. In immature oocytes, the CPE of mRNA such as cyclin B is bound to the CPEB, a zinc finger- and RRM-containing protein, and the poly(A) tail of the mRNA is typically short. The translation inhibition before maturation results from the interaction of maskin and eIF4E, and this last interaction inhibits the binding of eIF4G to eIF4E that would trigger the initiation of mRNA translation. The association of CPEB with maskin ensures that only CPE-containing mRNAs are repressed. In Xenopus oocytes, polyadenylation is initiated when progesterone interacts with its receptor leading to the activation of Aurora-A kinase and the phosphorylation of CPEB. Recent studies suggested that this phosphorylation event provokes the recruitment of CPSF, resulting in an addition of a poly(A) tail to mRNA. The phosphorylation of CPEB induces CPEB to bind and recruit CPSF possibly by stabilizing it on the AAUAAA sequence which in turn attracts poly(A) polymerase to the end of the mRNA. The activation of mRNA translation needs the dissociation of the complex eIF4E, maskin, and CPEB (25.Groisman I. Huang Y.S. Mendez R. Cao Q. Theurkauf W. Richter J.D.

This conformation loop of the mRNA prevents the recruitment of eIF4G on eIF4E and the subsequent 40 S ribosomal subunit positioning at the mRNA 5′ end, inhibiting the mRNA translation (27.Stebbins-Boaz B.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3852-3862Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In a search for Xenopus laevis Aurora-A substrates using a two-hybrid screen, we identified maskin (Xenopus TACC) as an Aurora-A binding partner. We demonstrate that both proteins interact in vitro and in vivo and that Aurora-A phosphorylates maskin in vitro. Maskin is a phosphoprotein in which the phosphorylation is partially dependent on Aurora-A in vivo. We found that injection in Xenopus stage VI oocytes of peptides mimicking the maskin sequence phosphorylated by Aurora-A accelerates the appearance of GVBD (meiosis I) induced by progesterone by allowing early translation of proteins normally expressed only for meiosis II. Materials—X. laevis adult females (CNRS, Rennes, France) were bred and maintained under laboratories conditions. They were anesthetized under 0.2% phenoxyethanol and surged in order to take half of an ovary to obtain stage VI oocytes. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibodies against Xl-Aurora-A (1C1 and 6E3) were produced in the laboratory, and polyclonal antibodies against cyclin B1 and cyclin B2 were gifts from T. Hunt (Cancer Research UK, South Mimms, UK). The polyclonal anti-Xl-Aurora-A antibodies were the gift from T. Lorca (CRBM, Montpellier, France); the polyclonal antibodies against maskin were the gift from J. Raff (Cancer Research UK, Cambridge, UK), and the polyclonal antibodies anti-Cdc6 were the gift from M. Mechali (IGH, Montpellier, France). The polyclonal antibodies against the phospho-Ser-626 of the protein maskin was performed by Eurogentec (Searing, Belgium) using the following peptide ESVLRKQS(P)LYKFDP. The GST and β-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma (G-7781 and T-4028, respectively), and the anti c-Mos antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC086). Synthetic Peptides—The synthetic peptides mp1 (SFKESVLRKQSLYLKFDP) and smp1 (scramble mp1, LSLYFEKSQSKVLRDPFK) were synthesized on a Milligen 9050 Pepsynthesizer in the SESO Laboratory, UMR6510, CNRS, Rennes, France. The peptides were then purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Hewlett-Packard), dissolved in appropriate buffer (2.5% Me2SO in H2O), and stored at –20 °C until used.

Yeast strain SFY 526 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, canr, gal4-54, gal80-538, URA3:GAL1-lacZ) was transformed by means of a pairwise combination of both two-hybrid vectors and grown on a medium without leucine or tryptophan. Galactosidase activities were assayed using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside staining on filter replicates according to Breeden and Nasmyth (30.Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Both pGADGH and pGBT9 vectors without insert were used as negative controls. Cloning of the DNA Encoding p17, Maskin, p17 S626A, and Maskin S626A—X. laevis maskin cDNA was obtained from MRC Geneservice (number 14227-h18) and then subcloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 27-4580-01) in order to produce the recombinant GST-maskin full-length (Fl) protein. P17 cDNA was subcloned in the same vector. Two rounds of PCR amplification obtained the mutant proteins GST-p17 S626A and GST-maskin FlS626A. The mutation S626A was performed by PCR amplification in the presence of the following oligonucleotides for GST-p17 and GST-maskin: (Sense)GTGCTCAGAAAGCAGGCTCTCTATCTGA; (Antisense)TCAGATAGAGAGCCTGCTTTCTGAGCAC. The second PCR performed to amplify the GST-p17 and GST-maskin mutated sequences was realized in the presence of the following oligonucleotides: GST-p17, (Sense)CGCGGATCCGTGGTTTTAAGTTATGCTGACC, and (Antisense)CGGGAATTCGGAGCTCGAAACTCGTCTTC; GST-maskin, (Sense)CGCGGATCCATGAGCCTTCA, and (Antisense)CCGCTCGAGTCAGATCTTCCC. All constructs were sequenced in full (Genome Express). Purification of Recombinant Proteins—All recombinant proteins were prepared from Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS. The bacteria induced to produce Aurora-A(His)6 were lysed in the IMAC 5 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 500 mm NaCl; 10% glycerin, and 5 mm imidazole) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm PMSF for 1 h at 4 °C (29.Roghi C.

The bacteria lysates were then centrifuged for 30 min at 12,000 × g at 4 °C (JA-20 rotor, Beckman Instruments), and the supernatants were filtered. The proteins were then purified by Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). The beads were washed twice with 10 volumes of IMAC 5 and were then incubated in 5% BSA in IMAC 5 for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were incubated with the beads for 3 h at 4 °C, and the beads were washed twice with 10 volumes of IMAC 5 and three times with 10 volumes of IMAC20 (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 500 mm NaCl; 10% glycerol; 20 mm imidazole). The His-tagged proteins were eluted with IMAC 250 (IMAC, 250 mm imidazole). The eluted fractions were controlled in concentration by Bradford analysis and for purity by electrophoresis onto a 12.5% SDS gel (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The recombinant GST-p17, GST-p17S626A, GST-maskin, and GST-maskin S626A were prepared as described previously (32.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5047) Google Scholar). The bacteria were lysed in PBS (138 mm NaCl; 2.7 mm KCl; 14 mm Na2HPO4; 1.8 mm KH2PO4; pH 7) with 1 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mm PMSF for 1 h at 4 °C. The glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were washed twice with PBS and then incubated in 5% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 4 °C. The bacteria lysate was mixed with the beads for 3 h on a wheel at 4 °C. The column was washed two times with PBS and three times with washing buffer (WB300: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 300 mm NaCl; 0,02% Tween 20; 1 mm PMSF). The proteins were eluted with 10 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8. The eluted fractions were controlled in concentration by Bradford analysis and for purity by electrophoresis onto a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (31.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Affinity Chromatography on a Nickel-NTA-Agarose; Ni-NTA Pull-down Assay—Fifty μl of nickel-agarose beads were washed in IMAC 5 and saturated with 10 volumes of IMAC 5 containing 3% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. In parallel, 4 μg of purified recombinant GST-p17 were incubated with 4 μg of recombinant Aurora-A(His)6 in 500 μl of interaction buffer (IB: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 100 mm KCl; 5 mm MgCl2; 0.1% Triton X-100; 20% glycerol) for 3 h at 4 °C on a wheel. The mixture was then loaded on the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed twice for 10 min at 4 °C in 10 volumes of IMAC 5 and three times in 10 volumes of IMAC 20. Histidine-tagged proteins and proteins bound to histidine-tagged proteins were eluted with 20 μl of IMAC 250. The samples were mixed with 20 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and the proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and submitted to a Western blot using the 1C1 antibody (diluted 1/200) and GST antibody (diluted 1/50,000). Affinity Chromatography on a GST-4B-Agarose; GST-Pull-down Assay—50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences, catalog number 17-0756-01) were washed in PBS and saturated with PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. Four μg of purified recombinant GST-p17 were incubated with 4 μg of recombinant Aurora-A(His)6 in 500 μl of binding buffer (BB: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8; 50 mm NaCl; 0.02% BSA; 0.02% Tween 20; 1 mm PMSF) for 3 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then loaded on the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. The beads were washed five times with WB300 for 10 min at 4 °C. The proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing 10 mm glutathione, mixed with 20 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Nitrocellulose membranes were then submitted to Western blot with the 1C1 antibody (diluted 1/200). In Vivo Co-immunoprecipitation—Ten μl of dried Affiprep protein-A (Bio-Rad) were washed with 500 μl of immunopure (A) IgG binding buffer (IBB, Pierce) and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 500 μl of 1C1 antibody (diluted 1/20) in IBB (diluted 1/2), and then washed twice with 500 μl of TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl). The beads were then incubated with a 10 eq of oocytes extract (MII) for 2 h at 4 °C on a wheel. The beads were washed once in 500 μl of 0.5% NaCl and five times with 500 μl of TBST (TBS, 0.05% Tween 20). Bound proteins were eluted in 10 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer, and the proteins were separated on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then immunoblotted. The Western blot analyses were performed with the anti-GST antibody (diluted 1/50,000) and the 1C1 (diluted 1/200). Protein Kinase Assay—Two μg of Aurora-A(His)6 were incubated in 15 μl of the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 25 mm NaCl; 1 mm dithiothreitol; 10 mm MgCl2) in the presence of 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 3,000 Ci/mmol and 10 μg of GST-p17 or GST-p17 S626A, GST-maskin or GST-maskin S626A. The reactions were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C, stopped by addition of 5 μl of 5× Laemmli sample buffer, separated on a 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. Phosphatase Treatment—A two-oocyte X. laevis extract was treated with 400 units of λ-PPase for 60 min at 30 °C (New England Biolabs). The proteins were then separated onto a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane before Western blotting with the antibody against X. laevis maskin (diluted 1/5000). In Vivo Analysis—Denuded oocytes (stage VI) were prepared in Merriam buffer (88 mm NaCl; 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2; 1 mm KCl; 0.41 mm CaCl2; 0.82 mm MgSO4; 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4) (33.Merriam R.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 68: 75-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Groups of 100 oocytes were injected with 35 ng of mp1 (35 nl at 1 mg/ml) or with the same volume of dilution buffer (2.5% Me2SO in H2O). Oocytes were stimulated for maturation with 3 × 10–6m of progesterone at 21 °C and GVBD was monitored by the appearance of the white spot. Every hour after stimulation, oocytes were collected by groups of 10, and the extracts were prepared with the extraction buffer (EB: 80 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.5; 20 mm EGTA; 15 mm MgCl2; 1 mm dithiothreitol) as described previously (34.Chen R.H. Murray A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 572-584PubMed Google Scholar). Proteases inhibitors were added to the lysate, centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g, and frozen at –80 °C until processed. The extracts were then used to measure the histone H1 kinase activity with 0.25 oocyte eq. Western Blotting—Oocytes extracts were electrophoresed on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane using the Bio-Rad system. The membranes were washed with TBST and saturated with 5% low fat milk in TBST for 2 h at room temperature. Western blot analysis was performed for identification of X. laevis Aurora-A, cyclin B2, cyclin B1, c-Mos, and Cdc6 overnight at 4 °C in 2.5% low fat milk. The polyclonal antibodies raised against Aurora-A (diluted 1/5,000), cyclin B2 (diluted 1/5,000), cyclin B1 (diluted 1/5,000), c-Mos (diluted 1/5,000), Cdc6 (diluted 1/2,000), anti-phospho-Ser-626-maskin (diluted 1/5,000), and the monoclonal antibody against Aurora-A 1C1 (diluted 1/200) were detected with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (diluted 1/50,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the Western blot chemiluminescence Super Signal kit from Pierce (Perbio). Samples loadings in the different Western blots were controlled with the polyclonal anti-β-tubulin (diluted 1/2,500). Aurora-A Interacts with Maskin in Vivo—A search for proteins interacting with Xl-Aurora-A was performed by two-hybrid screen using Aurora-A as bait and a X. laevis oocyte cDNA library. The strongest binding partner found (Fig. 1A) was encoded by a 435-bp cDNA that shared 88% identity with a portion of the CPEB-associated factor maskin cDNA (nucleotides 1545–1980). The isolated cDNA encoded a 145-amino acid peptide corresponding to a part of the original clone, hereafter called p17 (Fig. 1B) (27.Stebbins-Boaz B. Cao Q. de Moor C.H. Mendez R. Richter J.D. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1017-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The p17 sequence was subcloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector; the fusion protein GST-p17 was expressed in E. coli and then purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column. The recombinant GST-p17 protein runs as a 56-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1C, lane 2, upper panel) and was recognized by a polyclonal antibody directed against GST tag (Fig. 1C, lane 1, lower panel). The recombinant GST-p17 protein (Fig. 1C, lane 2) and the endogenous full-length maskin from oocytes extracts (migration at 150 kDa but theoretically 110 kDa when calculated with the molecular weight of the amino acids) were both recognized with an anti-maskin antibody (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3). Comparison of the p17 sequence with those of Xl-maskin and TACC from Drosophila or human revealed a consensus sequence... (R)X(S*)(L)... in which the serine residue (S*) is a site of phosphorylation for the TACC proteins (Fig. 1D). As the two proteins interact in the two-hybrid system, we asked whether maskin was phosphorylated in oocytes and whether it was an Aurora-A substrate. Aurora-A and Maskin Interact in Vitro—To investigate whether the protein maskin was a partner of Aurora-A, we performed two pull-down assays using recombinant tagged proteins. In a first series of experiments, Aurora-A(His)6 was incubated with or without GST-p17 or GST and then the mixture was loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. Aurora-A(His)6 was found to bind only to the GST-p17-containing beads (Fig. 2A). In a second round of experiments, the protein GST-p17 previously incubated with or without Aurora-A(His)6 was mixed with nickel-agarose beads (Ni-NTA-agarose) (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2). GST-p17 was found to bind only the Aurora-A(His)6-containing column (Fig. 2B, lane 1). These results indicated that both proteins interacted directly in vitro. Maskin Is Phosphorylated in Vivo—To test whether maskin was phosphorylated in vivo, protein extracts from oocytes at different stage of maturation (prophase, GVBD an metaphase arrest) were separated on SDS-PAGE, and we analyzed the phosphorylation status of the endogenous protein by Western blot with an antibody anti-maskin. The electrophoretic migration of maskin was compared in the extracts prepared from Xenopus oocytes arrested in prophase I (stage VI) and metaphase II (matured) before and after treatment with λ-PPase. The upper shift of the protein was not observed in the prophase extract, consequently the treatment with the λ-PPase did not induce any electrophoretic mobility shift suggesting that, in prophase I oocytes, maskin might not be phosphorylated (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2). In contrast, an upward shift of maskin was observed in GVBD- and metaphase II-arrested compared with prophase I-arrested oocytes (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1, 3, and 5). However, a modification of the mobility was observed in both GVBD and metaphase extract after treatment with the λ-PPase (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 6). The shift was because of protein phosphorylation demonstrating that maskin is phosphorylated in vivo. As maskin is phosphorylated in vivo, we asked whether Aurora-A could participate in this phosphorylation. We therefore assessed whether the interaction between Aurora-A and maskin occurred in oocytes. When endogenous Aurora-A was immunoprecipitated from prophase and metaphase II Xenopus oocytes extracts using anti-Aurora-A 1C1 antibody, maskin was found to co-immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2D, lane 1, upper panel). Maskin was not detected in an immunoprecipitate performed with a monoclonal antibody (6E3) directed against the recombinant protein Aurora-A(His)6 that does not recognize the endogenous Aurora-A protein (Fig. 2D, lane 2). To determinate whether the interaction evolved during maturation, the presence of maskin in the Aurora-A immunoprecipitate was compared between prophase I, GVBD, and metaphase-arrested oocytes (metaphase II). In both extracts, although the amount of immunoprecipitated Aurora-A in"

https://openalex.org/W2042590114,"The oncogenic fusion protein, Pax3/FKHR, is a more potent transcription factor relative to its normal counterpart, Pax3. Since Pax3 induced a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in human SaOS-2 osteosarcomas, we hypothesized that Pax3/FKHR would also induce a morphological change in SaOS-2 cells. We demonstrate here that Pax3/FKHR more potently induces a MET in SaOS-2 cells than Pax3. This greater potency was further evident where Pax3/FKHR, but not Pax3, induced a morphological alteration in U2-OS osteosarcoma cells. By microarray analysis, we determined that Pax3/FKHR altered the expression of gene targets in a manner quantitatively and qualitatively distinct from Pax3. Three classes of genes were identified: (i) genes induced or repressed by Pax3 and Pax3/FKHR, (ii) genes induced or repressed by Pax3/FKHR but not Pax3 and (iii) genes induced by Pax3/FKHR but repressed by Pax3. Chromatin immunoprecipitations confirmed the direct binding of Pax3/FKHR to the promoter region of several factors including cannabinoid receptor-1, EPHA2 and EPHA4. Verification of the microarray data also revealed coordinate alteration in the expression of factors involved in BMP4 signalling. Regulation of gene expression by Pax3 and Pax3/FKHR is, however, cell-type specific. BMP4 expression, for example, was repressed by both Pax3 and Pax3/FKHR in SaOS-2 cells, while in the rhabdomyosarcoma, RD, Pax3/FKHR, but not Pax3, induced BMP4 expression. Thus, our data reveal that Pax3/FKHR regulates a distinct but overlapping set of genes relative to Pax3 and that the global set of Pax3 and Pax3/FKHR gene targets is cell-type specific."

MKP-7, a JNK-specific phosphatase, possesses a unique COOH-terminal stretch (CTS) in addition to domains conserved among MKP family members. The CTS contains several motifs such as a nuclear localization signal, a nuclear export signal, PEST sequences, and a serine residue (Ser-446) that can be phosphorylated by activated ERK, suggesting an important regulatory role(s).35S-pulse labeling experiments indicate that the half-life of MKP-7 is 1.5 h, a period significantly elongated by deleting the CTS. We also show that overexpressed MKP-7 is polyubiquitinated when co-expressed with ubiquitin and that proteasome inhibitors markedly inhibit MKP-7 degradation. We also determined that MKP-7 phosphorylated at Ser-446 has a longer half-life than unphosphorylated form of the wild type protein, as does a phospho-mimic mutant of MKP-7. These results indicate that activation of the ERK pathway strongly blocks JNK activation through stabilization of MKP-7 mediated by phosphorylation.

Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 2Wada T. Penninger J.M. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2838-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1248) Google Scholar). Three subfamilies of MAP kinases (MAPKs) have been well characterized: ERKs (extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases), JNKs (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases), and the p38 MAPK kinases. It is well established that ERK1/2 are typically stimulated by growth-related stimuli, while JNK and p38 are primarily activated by stress-related signals such as heat and osmotic shock, UV irradiation, and inflammatory cytokines. MAPK pathways are regulated at multiple levels to ensure the specificity, timing, and strength of their activity. One critical aspect of this regulation is reversible phosphorylation of MAPKs. Negative regulation of MAPKs is achieved by dual dephosphorylation of the TXY motif by phosphatases. As in vivo candidates for negative regulators, the MAPK phosphatases (MKPs), a family of dual specificity protein phosphatases, have been identified (3Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). MKPs are primarily composed of two domains, a rhodanese-like domain and a dual specificity phosphatase catalytic domain (4Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In mammals 10 genes encoding MKPs differing in substrate specificity and subcellular localization have been reported. According to phylogenetic analysis and gene structure, MKPs can be classified into four groups (5Theodosiou A. Ashworth A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2387-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 6Farooq A. Zhou M-M. Cell. Signal. 2004; 16: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 7Alonso A. Rojas A. Godzik A. Mustelin T. Topics Curr. Genet. 2004; 5: 333-358Crossref Google Scholar). Group I contains the nuclear MKPs: MKP-1/DUSP1, PAC1/DUSP2, MKP-2/DUSP4, and hVH-3/DUSP5, all of which target the three primary MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38. Group II includes cytoplasmic MKPs that mainly target ERK, namely, MKP-3/DUSP6, PYST2/DUSP7, and MKP-4/DUSP9. Group III contains MKP-5/DUSP10, which exhibits a unique NH2-terminal domain in addition to the MKP common structure. MKP-5, which is both nuclear and cytoplasmic, dephosphorylates JNK and p38. Group IV consists of the nuclear and cytoplasmic MKPs, hVH5/DUSP8, and MKP-7/DUSP16. These proteins exhibit a unique COOH-terminal sequence of about 300 amino acid residues in addition to the common MKP structure (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9Tanoue T. Yamamoto T. Maeda R. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26629-26639Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We previously showed that MKP-7 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and suppresses activation of MAP kinases in COS-7 cells in the order of selectivity JNK » p38 > ERK. Using several mutant proteins, we found that a long COOH-terminal stretch (CTS) contains a functional nuclear export signal and a nuclear localization signal, both of which enable MKP-7 to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and that the CTS determines JNK preference for MKP-7 by masking MKP-7 activity toward p38 (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recently we found that the CTS domain is bound by ERK and that Ser-446 in the CTS is phosphorylated by ERK depending on several external stimuli (10Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that the CTS plays important regulatory role(s) in cells. Although very few studies address their post-translational regulation, it is known that some MKP/dual specificity phosphatases can be phosphorylated and/or polyubiquitinated. MKP-1 is phosphorylated by ERK on two COOH-terminal serine residues, Ser-359 and Ser-364, which does not directly affect phosphatase activity but results in stabilization of the protein due to reduced degradation by the ubiquitin-directed proteasome complex (11Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). VH-1-related phosphatase (VHR) has also been reported to be phosphorylated on Tyr-138 by ZAP-70, resulting in translocation of VHR to the immune synapse (12Alonso A. Rahmouni S. Williams S. van Stipdonk M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. Abraham R.T. Schoenberger S.P. Mustelin T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). So far some MKPs have been reported to be phosphorylated. MKP-1 is phosphorylated by ERK1/2 in vivo as well as in vitro, which inhibits protein degradation. hVH-5 is phosphorylated in response to PMA treatment, but the physiological consequences of such modification are not known (13Johnson T.R. Biggs J.R. Winbourn S.E. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31755-31762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Xenopus CL100 (XCL100), a homologue of human MKP-1, is phosphorylated by ERK in a cell cycle-dependent manner (14Sohaskey M.L. Ferrell J Jr E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the case of XCL100, serine residue(s) are phosphorylated during the G2 phase, and serine and threonine residues are phosphorylated during M phase. Experiments with proteasome inhibitors demonstrate that not only MKP-1 but MKP-2 degradation is mediated via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (15Torres C. Francis M.K. Lorenzini A. Tresini M. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently we found that the CTS of MKP-7 is bound by ERK and that Ser-446 in the CTS is phosphorylated by ERK in response to several external stimuli (10Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Since MKP-7 is a JNK phosphatase, it is important to analyze physiological significance of phosphorylation of MKP-7 by ERK. Such analysis could explain how MKP-7 links ERK activity to stress kinase activations. The CTS in MKP-7 contains two PEST sequences (regions abundant in proline, glutamate, serine, and threonine residues) (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), which are found in many rapidly degraded proteins and have been suggested to signal proteolytic degradation (16Rechsteiner M.C.

In the present study, we determine the stability of MKP-7 and identify sequences mediating protein degradation. We also analyze the effect of Ser-446 phosphorylation on MKP-7 stability. Plasmid Construction—Mammalian expression vectors, pFLAG-MKP-7, pFLAG-MKP-7-(1–370), -(1–568), and -(1–604), and -S446A have been described previously (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Point mutations of pFLAG-MKP-7S446A and S446D were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis system (Stratagene). pFLAG-MKP-7-(1–435), -(1–511), -(162–665), -(371–665), -(371–665)S446A, -371–665)S446D, -(390–665), -(436–665), -436–665)S446A, -Δ406–540, -ΔP1 (deletion from 332–353), and -ΔP2 (deletion from 441–462) were constructed by PCR. To construct pFLAG-MKP-2, pFLAG-MKP-3, and pFLAG-MKP-5, the coding region of human MKP-2, MKP-3, and MKP-5 were amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV2 vector (Sigma). pCI-neo-T7-ubiquitin and pCI-neo-HA-ubiquitin were kind gifts of Dr. Yokosawa (19Sasajima H. Nakagawa K. Yokosawa H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3596-3604Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and DNA Transfection—COS-7 and HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with various expression vectors using the FuGene-6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. 35S Pulse-Chase Analysis—At 32 h after DNA transfection, COS-7 cells were cultured in the presence of a Expre35S35S protein labeling mix (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h. The radioactive medium was removed, and cells were chased with non-radioactive medium. At the indicated times, cells were lysed with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min, and the resulting supernatants were used as cell extracts. Each sample was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of mouse anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel. The intensity of bands of FLAG-MKP-7 and mutant proteins was quantified using an FLA-3000 imaging system (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). Immunoblot Analysis of Cells Treated with Cycloheximide and Proteasome Inhibitors—Eighteen hours after DNA transfection, COS-7 cells (2 × 105/35-mm-diameter plate) were starved for 14 h and treated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for the indicated times. To determine the effect of proteasome-mediated proteolysis, 20 μm MG115 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan), 20 μm MG132 (Peptide Institute), or Me2SO as a vehicle was added 2 h before cycloheximide treatment. For immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed in MAPK lysis buffer as described previously (10Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were subjected to immunoblot with anti-FLAG M2 or anti-actin (Sigma) antibody. Ubiquitination Assay—COS-7 cells (4 × 105/60-mm-diameter plate) were transfected with 2.4 μg of pFLAG-MKP-7 together with 0.4 μg each of pCI-neo-T7-ubiquitin and pCI-neo-HA-ubiquitin. Eighteen hours after transfection, cells were starved for 12 h and then treated with 20 μm MG132 for 6 h. The cells were lysed in MAPK buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation using 3 μg of anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 fast flow. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated on a 10% gel and subjected to immunoblot using anti-T7 monoclonal antibody (Novagen) or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibody (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cell Staining—Immunohistochemical analyses were performed as described (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To detect FLAG-tagged proteins immunofluorescence was performed using anti-FLAG rabbit antibody with AlexaFluor 488-conjugataed anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) or AlexaFluor 546-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen). To detect phospho-Ser-446 of MKP-7 immunofluorescence was undertaken using anti-phospho-Ser-446 antibody with AlexaFluor 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) or AlexaFluor 488-conjugataed anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were detected by staining with 1 μg/ml 4–6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Fluorescence was visualized under a fluorescence confocal microscope (Olympus). Anti-phospho-Ser-446 monoclonal antibody was developed against a phosphopeptide NKLCQFpSPVQEC as described previously (20Yasui Y. Urano T. Kawajiri A. Nagata K. Tatsuka M. Saya H. Furukawa K. Takahashi T. Izawa I. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12997-13003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). MKP-7 Is an Unstable Protein in COS-7 Cells—To determine whether MKP-7 is rapidly degraded, pulse-chase experiments were performed. COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pFLAG-MKP-7 were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased with non-radioactive medium up to 4 h. Radiolabeled FLAG-MKPs were precipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 4-h chase time points and subjected to autoradiography (Fig. 1, insets). The half-life of MKP-7 was shown to be 1.5 h (Fig. 1a). Under the same experimental conditions, half-lives of MKP-2, MKP-3, and MKP-5, which are representative of groups I, II, and III, respectively, were analyzed. The half-life of MKP-2, known to be a short-lived protein due to proteasome-dependent degradation (15Torres C. Francis M.K. Lorenzini A. Tresini M. Cristofalo V.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 290: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), was shown to be 1.2 h (Fig. 1b). The half-lives of MKP-3 and MKP-5 were both 4 h (Fig. 1c and d). These data indicate that like MKP-2, but unlike MKP-3 and MKP-5, MKP-7 is a highly unstable protein. MKP-7 Is Degraded by a Ubiquitin-dependent Pathway—To determine whether the rapid turnover of MKP-7 is due to proteasomal activity, we analyzed the effect of two proteasome inhibitors, MG115 and MG132, on degradation of MKP-7 (Fig. 2A). Immunoblot analysis showed that in the absence of inhibitors, levels of FLAG-MKP-7 were rapidly decreased in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis. This reduction was completely inhibited by treatment of COS-7 cells with MG115 or MG132. Under these conditions, the amounts of actin were constant. These results suggest that MKP-7 is degraded by the proteasome. An important component of proteasome-mediated degradation is the proper targeting of the protein to be degraded by the ubiquitin conjugation complex (21Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7151-7160Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). This process results in the attachment of multiple ubiquitin chains to the target protein. To determine whether MKP-7 was ubiquitinated, we transiently overexpressed FLAG-MKP-7 in COS-7 cells with or without T7- and HA-ubiquitin. Proteins were similarly ubiquitinated in lysates from cells with or without co-expressed FLAG-MKP-7 (Fig. 2B, right). FLAG-MKP-7 was purified from the FLAG-MKP-7 containing cell extracts using anti-FLAG-Sepharose (Fig. 2B, left). A high molecular weight smear, characteristic of polyubiquitination, was observed in lysates from cells in which MKP-7 and ubiquitin were co-expressed, demonstrating that MKP-7 is degraded by the ubiquitin/proteosomal pathway (Fig. 2B, left). Deletion of the COOH-terminal Region Affects Stability of MKP-7 but Deletion of the PEST Sequences Does Not—To determine sequences required for ubiquitin-proteasome dependent degradation of MKP-7, we prepared constructs of two deletion mutants, MKP-7-(162–665) and MKP-7-(1–370). Pulse-chase experiments showed that the degradation rate of MKP-7-(162–665) was similar to that of the wild type protein, while MKP-7-(1–370) was stable until 4 h (Fig. 3A), suggesting that the stability of MKP-7 is determined primarily by amino acid residues between 371 and 665. Previously we reported the presence of two PEST sequences, PEST1 (332–353, PEST score = 7.16) and PEST2 (441–462, PEST score = 5.16). To clarify whether the PEST sequences of MKP-7 are required for its degradation, we prepared constructs encoding mutant proteins, MKP-7ΔP1 and -ΔP2, which lack PEST1 and PEST2, respectively. Interestingly, the half-lives of MKP-7ΔP1 and -ΔP2 were similar to that of the wild type protein (Fig. 3B), indicating that instability of MKP-7 is not conferred by the PEST regions. Identification of Sequences in the CTS Required for Degradation of MKP-7—To determine which sequences in the CTS play a role in stability, expression vectors encoding COOH-terminal deletion mutant proteins, MKP-7-(1–604), -(1–568), -(1–511), -(1–435), and -Δ406–540 were constructed (Fig. 4A). Using pulse-chase analysis, the half-lives of wild type and mutant proteins were calculated (Fig. 4B). The half-life of MKP-7-(1–604), which was 1.7 h, was similar to that of the wild type protein. However, the half-lives of MKP-7-(1–568) and MKP-7-(1–511) were 5.0 and 4.8 h, respectively, indicating that amino acid residues 569–604 are involved in protein degradation. By contrast, degradation of MKP-7-(1–435) was not observed until 4 h. The observation that PEST2 is equivalent to amino acid residues 441–462 indicates that it is not involved in degradation (Fig. 3B) and suggests rather that amino acid residues 463–511 are involved in protein degradation. We designated residues 463–511 and 569–604 as regions 1 and 2, respectively. The half-life of MKP-7Δ406–540, which contains region 2 but lacks region 1, was shown to be 3.5 h. These data indicated that the CTS, in particular regions 1 and 2, are involved in degradation of MKP-7. Detection of Upward Mobility Shift of the CTS—To examine the relationship between phosphorylation at Ser-446 of MKP-7 and its degradation through the CTS, we prepared expression vectors of CTS fragments including Ser-446. COS-7 cells, transfected with pFLAG-MKP-7-(371–665), -(390–665), or -(436–665) (Fig. 5), were labeled with [35S]methionine and chased. We found that 35S-labeled MKP-7-(371–665) and MKP-7-(390–665) were detected as doublets, while 35S-labeled MKP-7-(436–665) was seen as a single band by autoradiography (Fig. 5, insets). The half-lives of the lower bands of pFLAG-MKP-7-(371–665) and MKP-7-(390–665) were 1.2 and 1.5 h, respectively, which are equivalent to that of the wild type MKP-7 protein. In contrast, the half-lives of the upper bands of MKP-7-(371–665) and MKP-7-(390–665) and band of MKP-7-(436–665) were 2.9, 3.2, and 2.8 h, respectively. We demonstrated previously that upon PMA stimulation, Ser-446 of FLAG-MKP-7 is phosphorylated by co-expressed HA-ERK2, resulting in an upward mobility shift of FLAG-MKP-7 seen on SDS-PAGE (10Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). By analogy, it is possible that the upwardly shifted bands of MKP-7-(371–665) and MKP-7-(390–665) correspond to phosphorylated forms. Detection of Phosphorylation at Ser-446 in Cells—To detect phosphorylation of Ser-446 in cells, we developed an antibody raised against a peptide containing phosphoserine-446. Cells transfected with FLAG-MKP-7 and HA-ERK2 were stained with this antibody after treatment with or without PMA. No protein was detected by the antibody in cells without PMA-treatment (Fig. 6A, upper panels). FLAG-MKP-7 was phosphorylated in PMA-treated cells (Fig. 6A, lower panels), but MKP-7S446A under the same conditions was not (data not shown). These results indicate that the antibody is mono-specific for phospho-Ser-446. Since this antibody did not detect any protein in an immunoblot analysis (data not shown), we conclude that the antibody is suitable only for immunohistological analyses. To determine whether FLAG-MKP-7-(371–665) and FLAG-MKP-7-(390–665) are phosphorylated in cells even in the absence of HA-ERK2 and without PMA-treatment, COS-7 cells were transfected with pFLAG-MKP-7-(371–665), -(390–665), -(436–665), or -(371–665)S446A and stained with anti-phospho-Ser-446 antibody (Fig. 6B) without any stimuli. As shown in Fig. 6B, specific interaction with phospho-Ser-446 was confirmed since the antibody does not recognize MKP-7-(371–665)446A (compare lanes m and n). As shown in Fig. 6B, MKP-7-(371–665) was phosphorylated in some cells indicated by arrows but not in others (compare lanes a and b). Likewise, MKP-7-(390–665) was phosphorylated in some cells as indicated by arrows but not in others (compare lanes e and f). In contrast, MKP-7-(436–665) was phosphorylated in almost all transfected cells (compare lanes i and j). These strongly suggested that the upper bands of MKP-7-(371–665) and MKP-7-(390–665) and the single band of MKP-7-(436–665) seen in Fig. 5 are phosphorylated forms. Since the half-lives of these bands are longer than those of the lower bands of MKP-7-(371–665) and MKP-7-(390–665), it is likely that phosphorylation at Ser-446 stabilizes the CTS fragment. It is significant that expressed COOH-terminal fragments can be phosphorylated even in the absence of HA-ERK2 without PMA stimuli. We showed previously that HA-JNK1 can phosphorylate Ser-446 in a MKP-7CS mutant that lacks JNK phosphatase activity (10Masuda K. Shima H. Katagiri C. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32448-32456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal fragment may be catalyzed not only by endogenous ERK but by endogenous JNK in cells. Phosphorylation on Ser-446 Stabilizes MKP-7—To confirm that phosphorylation at Ser-446 of the CTS confers stability, the half-lives of MKP-7-(371–665)S446A and -(371–665)S446D, which are nonphosphorylatable and phosphorylation-mimicking mutants, respectively, were analyzed (Fig. 7, left panel). The half-lives of MKP-7-(371–665)S446A and -S446D were 1.3 and 3.2 h, respectively, which is equivalent to the half-lives of the lower and upper bands of MKP-7-(371–665) (Fig. 5, left panel). Furthermore, the half-life of MKP-7-(436–665)S446A was shown to be 1.3 h (Fig. 7, right panel), which was shorter than that of MKP-7-(436–665) (Fig. 5, right panel). These data suggest that phosphorylation at Ser-446 stabilizes the CTS fragment. We then asked whether this finding applies to wild type MKP-7. The time course of degradation of MKP-7S446D, a phosphorylation mimicking mutant, and MKP-7S446A, a nonphosphorylatable mutant in cells with no stimuli, was analyzed (Fig. 8). The half-life of MKP-7S446D was 4.0 h, and that of MKP-7S446A and the wild type protein was 1.5 h, indicating that phosphorylation of Ser-446 stabilizes MKP-7 protein. These data strongly suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-446 increases the half-life of MKP-7 by regulating the stability of the COOH-terminal region.Fig. 8A phosphomimicking mutant of MKP-7 has a longer half-life than phosphodefficient MKP-7. COS-7 cells (2 × 105/35-mm-diameter plate) were transfected with 1.2 μg of pFLAG-MKP-7WT, -S446A, or -S446D. 32 h after transfection, cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 1 h and chased for the indicated times. The levels of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were monitored by autoradiography. The graph shows the relative intensity of [35S]methionine-labeled MKP-7 mutant proteins. The intensity in labeled cells without chase was defined as 100%. Data shown are the means from three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we found that MKP-7 is a short-lived protein that is degraded via ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Two regions, amino acid residues 463–511 and 569–604, in the carboxyl terminus of MKP-7 were shown to target the protein for degradation. We then asked whether protein degradation is regulated by phosphorylation on Ser-446. Using several deletion mutants, we found that upwardly shifted bands in SDS-PAGE corresponding to phosphorylated forms have longer half-lives than the non-shifted ones. Furthermore, a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant of MKP-7 showed a longer half-life than a phosphorylation-deficient one. These results strongly suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-446 of MKP-7 blocks its rapid degradation. MKP-7 suppresses MAPK activation in the order of selectivity, JNK » p38 > ERK. We also determined whether phosphorylation at Ser-446 affects substrate specificity. Replacement of Ser-446 by aspartate or glutamate did not mediate any difference in substrate specificity (data not shown). Therefore, we propose that the physiological importance of phosphorylation at Ser-446 is as follows (Fig. 9). In quiescent cells, MKP-7 is maintained at low levels due to rapid turnover by the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway. Upon activation of cells by growth factors, ERK is activated through the MAPKKK/MEK/ERK pathway, and activated ERK can phosphorylate Ser-446 of MKP-7. This phosphorylation does not modify the substrate specificity of MKP-7 but leads to stabilization of the protein. Accumulation-phosphorylated MKP-7 strongly suppress JNK activation. So far several motifs such as the PEST sequences (16Rechsteiner M.C. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 17Rechsteiner M.C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) are reported to be required for rapid proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Since the identification of MKP-7, it has been speculated that MKP-7 is unstable, since it contains two PEST sequences (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether these motifs play a role in protein stability, we mutated them (Fig. 3B); however, analyses of the mutants showed that their disruption does not increase MKP-7 stability. Instead, regions 1 (463–511) and 2 (569–604) were shown to mediate MKP-7 instability. Regions 1 and 2 may provide binding sites for components of the ubiquitin system, for example by interacting with an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Since deletion of region 1 or 2 independently increases stability, it is possible that such a ligase interacts with both regions 1 and 2. Phosphorylation of Ser-446 may block an E3 ligase from interacting with these regions. On the other hand, our site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that the 12 lysine residues present in regions 1 and 2 are not sites for ubiquitination (data not shown). By doing a comparison of the amino acid sequences of regions 1 and 2 with other candidate motifs mentioned above, we found a RXXL box, core sequences in the cyclin destruction box (29Zur A. Brandeis M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4500-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), at positions 487–490 in region 1. The RXXL box is a targeting signal of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), a 1500-kDa complex comprised of many different subunits that serves as the ubiquitin ligase (E3) (30Peters J.M. King R.W. Hoog C. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1199-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Identification of targets recognized by regions 1 and 2 is now in progress. Several reports demonstrated that MKP-1 and MKP-2, which are nuclear MKPs, are short-lived due to ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis (11Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 15Torres C. Francis M.K. Lorenzini A. Tresini M. Cristofalo V.J. Exp.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7108-7116Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Here, we show that MKP-7 is also highly unstable, as is MKP-2 (Fig. 1). We reported previously that MKP-7 is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, but this localization becomes nuclear following leptomycin B treatment or replacement of leucine by alanine in the nuclear export signal (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To determine whether localization of MKP-7 affects its degradation, we estimated the half-life of the Leu-to-Ala mutant, which affects nuclear localization. The half-life of the Leu-to-Ala mutant was similar to that of the wild type (data not shown), indicating that the efficiency of MKP-7 degradation is similar in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Previously we mapped MKP-7 to 12p12, an area prone to deletions in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome (8Masuda K. Shima H. Watanabe M. Kikuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39002-39011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been reported that JNK is constitutively activated in several tumor cell lines and that the transforming action of some oncogene is JNK-dependent (33Bost F. McKay R. Dean N. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33422-33429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 34Antonyak M.A. Moscatello D.K. Wong A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2817-2822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Since MKP-7 was identified as a phosphatase specific for JNK, it could also function as a tumor suppressor in cancers through negative regulation of the JNK pathway. Whether the MKP-7 gene is deleted or mutated in tumors from patients is crucially important. Recently it was reported that among 22 leukemia patients analyzed, 17 were hemizygous for MKP-7/DUSP16, but no inactivating mutations could be detected (35Hoornaert I. Marynen P. Goris J. Sciot R. Baens M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 7728-7736Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and investigators hypothesized that MKP-7/DUSP16 could be haploinsufficient for tumor suppression. Another group also reported that expression of MKP-7/DUSP16 gene is significantly down-regulated in both clinical tumors and cultured prostate cancer cell lines (36Kibel A.S. Huagen J. Guo C. Isaacs W.B. Yan Y. Pienta K.J. Goodfellow P.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 109: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These data suggest that down-regulation of the MKP-7/DUSP16 gene may be critical for initiation or progression of several tumors. Here we demonstrate that MKP-7 protein levels are regulated by a phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquin-mediated protein degradation pathway. Whether this pathway is impaired in certain cancers remains to be determined. Recent reports indicate that ERK1/2 activity functions in MKP-1 degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Activation of ERK1/2 induces phosphorylation and reduced degradation of MKP-1 in CCL39 hamster fibroblasts (11Brondello J.M. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and in Xenopus oocytes (14Sohaskey M.L. Ferrell J Jr E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 454-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These observations indicate a control mechanism designed to limit undesirable long term activation of ERK1/2. In contrast, ERK1/2 signaling can trigger degradation of MKP-1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in CL3 human lung cancer cells treated with Pb(II), a carcinogenic metal (31Lin Y.W. Chuang S.M. Yang J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21534-21541Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this case, ERK1/2 activation is sustained by stimulating MKP-1 degradation. Data presented here are the first to report that the stability of an MKP other than MKP-1 is regulated by phosphorylation. It is important to note that phosphorylation of MKP-7 by ERK does not affect the ERK pathway positively or negatively but rather affects the JNK pathway. Our results demonstrate that MKP-7 is involved in negative cross-talk between the JNK and ERK pathways and strongly suggest that sustained activation of ERK can result in attenuation of JNK activation through phosphorylation of MKP-7.

However, the enhancer elements mediating c-myc deregulation in vivo remain largely unidentified. To investigate the role of the IgH 3′-enhancers in c-myc deregulation, we used gene targeting to generate knock-in mice in which four DNase I hypersensitive regions from the murine IgH 3′-region were integrated into the 5′-region of the c-myc locus. The IgH 3′-enhancers induced the up-regulation of c-myc expression specifically in B cells of IgH-3′-E-myc mice. After ∼10 months, the mice developed a Burkitt-like B cell lymphoma with the phenotype of B220+, IgM+, and IgDlow. Analysis of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements indicated that the lymphoma cells were of clonal origin. The presence of a rapidly expanding population of B cells in the spleen and bone marrow of young knock-in mice at 2–4 months of age was observed. Premalignant splenic B cells of knock-in mice showed higher spontaneous and induced apoptosis; however, malignant B cells were more resistant to apoptosis. The p53-ARF-Mdm2 pathway was disabled in half of the lymphomas examined, in most cases through Mdm2 overexpression. Although c-myc expression was increased in premalignant B cells, the promoter shift from P2 to P1 was observed only in malignant B cells. Our studies demonstrate that the IgH 3′-enhancers play an important role in c-myc deregulation and B cell lymphomagenesis in vivo.

Burkitt's lymphoma and many mouse plasmacytomas are associated with chromosomal translocations that juxtapose the c-myc proto-oncogene to regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IgH) 1The abbreviations used are: IgH, immunoglobulin heavy chain gene; HS, hypersensitive sites; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT-PCR, reverse transcription PCR; ES, embryonic stem. or one of the light chain loci and subsequently deregulate c-myc (1.Boxer L.M.

In Burkitt's lymphoma, the translocated c-myc gene is activated, whereas the normal allele is silent. Myc is a key regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (4.Dang C.V.

Biophys. 2003; 416: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and its expression is tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in normal cells. Myc enhances cell proliferation by promoting cell cycle progression, inhibiting differentiation, and enhancing cellular metabolism. In addition, c-Myc overexpression triggers the apoptotic program (7.Hermeking H. Eick D. Science. 1994; 256: 2091-2093Crossref Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 8.Eischen C.M. Packham G. Nip J. Fee B.E. Hiebert S.W. Zambetti G.P. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6983-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and sensitizes cells to a range of apoptotic stimuli such as withdrawal of survival factors, death receptor signals, and DNA damage (9.Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). It is thought that apoptosis acts as an intrinsic limit to the oncogenic potential of c-Myc (10.Evan G. Littlewood T. Science. 1998; 281: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). Inhibition of apoptosis through additional mutations favors continued growth and malignant transformation of the affected cells. Although it is believed that deregulated c-myc plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Burkitt's lymphoma, the identity of the regulatory elements of the IgH locus that result in c-myc activation remains unclear. Several enhancers have been identified in the murine and human IgH loci. The IgH intronic enhancer (Eμ) was the first enhancer discovered in the IgH locus and has been shown to be involved in VDJ rearrangement and gene expression in early B-lineage cells (11.Chen J. Young F. Bottaro A. Steward V. Smith R.K. Alt F.W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4635-4645Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 12.Serwe M. Sablitzky F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2321-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The Eμ enhancer is not linked to the translocated c-myc allele in most sporadic Burkitt's lymphomas. The IgH 3′-enhancers are located ∼16 kb downstream of the Cα gene in the mouse and 25 kb downstream of the human Cα gene. The 3′-enhancers consist of four DNase I-hypersensitive sites (HS1234), which have been shown to function as a locus control region in B cells (13.Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and they activate c-myc expression in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (13.Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14.Kanda K. Hu H.-M. Zhang L. Grandchamps J. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32338-32346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The IgH 3′-enhancers also mediate a shift in promoter usage of c-myc from P2 to P1, one of the mechanisms of c-myc deregulation in Burkitt's lymphoma. The IgH 3′-enhancers are invariably linked to the translocated c-myc gene in all Burkitt's lymphomas with the IgH translocation and are therefore the best candidate elements to cause deregulation of c-myc expression in Burkitt's lymphoma. Several mouse models that link the c-myc oncogene to sequences from the immunoglobulin genes have been developed. However, most of these do not provide completely accurate models for Burkitt's lymphoma. Transgenic mice bearing c-myc driven by the IgH Eμ enhancer produced primarily precursor-B cell malignancies (15.Adams J.M. Harris A.W. Pinkert C.A. Corcoran L.M. Alexander W.S. Cory S. Palmiter R.D. Brinster R.L. Nature. 1985; 318: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar). Mice carrying a yeast artificial chromosome with c-myc linked to a portion of IgH sequence also developed B cell tumors (16.Butzler C. Zou X. Popov A.V. Bruggemann M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but similar malignancies were observed in the yeast artificial chromosome-based mice with or without the Eμ enhancer (17.Palomo C. Zou X. Nicholson I.C. Butzler C. Bruggemann M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5625-5628PubMed Google Scholar). A transgenic mouse with a construct based on the Igλ translocation produced a more appropriate model for Burkitt's lymphoma (18.Kovalchuk A.L. Qi C.-F. Torrey T.A. Takkesse-Heath L. Feigenbaum L. Park S.S. Gerbitz A. Klobeck G. Hoertnagel K. Polack A. Bornkamm G.W. Janz S. Morse H.C.I. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism of c-myc deregulation in Burkitt's lymphoma and to test the hypothesis that the IgH 3′-enhancers play a major role in c-myc deregulation in vivo, we established a mouse model (IgH-3′E-myc) where the IgH 3′-enhancers were integrated into the c-myc locus. Our mouse model has several unique features, and we show that the IgH-3′E-myc mice develop a B cell B220+IgM+IgDlow lymphoma, which resembles Burkitt's lymphoma in humans. The role of deregulated expression of c-myc in B cell development, cell proliferation, and apoptosis is also evaluated. Targeting Vector—A genomic c-myc BAC clone was isolated from a 129/J library (Incyte Genomics). A 4.0-kb fragment containing exons 2 and 3 was subcloned by digestion of the c-myc BAC clone. Two fragments of 2.6 kb (5′-flanking region) and 1.5 kb (exon 1) were amplified by PCR using primers: 5′-ATGAAGTGGTACCCTTTCATTTCC-3′, 5′-AGCGGTACCCTTCCTCCCAGGACAAACCCAAG-3′, 5′-AGTGTAGGATAAGCAAATCCCGAGG-3′, and 5′-TCGCTCTACCCCGACTCAGATCTAC-3′. To generate the targeting vector, the 1.5-kb PCR fragment was digested with HpaI and XhoI and inserted into the pPNTloxP vector 3′ of the neomycin cassette. Then the 4.0-kb fragment was cloned adjacent to the 1.5-kb PCR fragment at the XhoI site. To make the 5′-arm, the 2.6-kb PCR fragment was cloned at the KpnI site 5′ of the neomycin cassette. A 4.2-kb fragment containing the four DNase I hypersensitive sites of the murine IgH 3′-enhancers (IgH-3′E) was inserted between the neomycin cassette and the 1.5-kb PCR fragment. Generation of IgH-3′E-myc Knock-in Mice—R1 ES (129/J) cells were electroporated with the linearized targeting vector, selected with G418 and ganciclovir, and screened by PCR using a neomycin primer and a primer with the sequence 5′ to the construct arms. Recombinant ES clones were confirmed by Southern blot analysis with a probe containing genomic sequences 3′ to the construct arms. Two targeted clones were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts and then transferred into pseudopregnant mothers. Germ line transmission was confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis from mouse tail DNA. To remove the neomycin cassette, the neomycin-IgH-3′E-myc mice were bred with mice carrying a transgene expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the β-actin promoter (19.Lewandoski M. Meyers E.N. Martin G.R. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1997; 62: 159-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate IgH-3′E-myc knock-in mice. mRNA Expression—RNA was isolated from fresh tissues using the tri-reagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), and cDNA was prepared using the RETROscript kit (Ambion). Real time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7900-HT sequence detection system. c-myc expression was analyzed using the mm-myc primer-probe set (Gorilla). Murine p53 and GAPDH were analyzed with pre-developed TaqMan assay reagents (Applied Biosystems). Gene expression levels were normalized to GAPDH. Western Blot—Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1mMNaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4,1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate with addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and proteinase inhibitor mixture II (Calbiochem). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on each lane, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with the specific antibody. The c-Myc (9E-10), Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mdm2, and Bax antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The antibody to p53 was from Calbiochem, and the p19ARF antibody was from Novus Biologicals. Flow Cytometry—Cells from spleen, thymus, and bone marrow were prepared in cold phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% sodium azide. Splenocytes were depleted of erythrocytes by ammonium chloride lysis, and 1 × 106 cells were stained with conjugated antibodies for cell surface markers and analyzed using the FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Ten thousand events were collected and analyzed by CellQuest software. Proliferation Assay—Spleens were dispersed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. B cells were purified using the B cell isolation kit from Miltenyi. Purified splenic B cells were cultured at 2.5 × 105 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were activated with lipopolysaccharide (10 μg/ml, Sigma), PMA (20 ng/ml), PMA (20 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (500 ng/ml), anti-IgM F(ab′)2 (15 μg/ml, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and anti-CD40 (5 μg/ml, Pharmingen) for 24 h. Cell proliferation was measured by a colorimetric method using XTT (Roche Applied Science). Cell Cycle Analysis—2 × 106 cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in ice-cold 75% ethanol and fixed overnight. Cells were resuspended in propidium iodide staining solution with 14 μg/ml RNase A and incubated in the dark for 2 h and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis Assay—Freshly isolated lymphocytes from the spleen were cultured in 400 μl of medium at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml in 48-well plates. Cells were incubated with varying concentrations of etoposide for 16 or 48 h and washed and stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-B220. Then the cells were washed and stained with 7-AAD (50 μg/ml). Cell viability was determined by flow cytometry. For the spontaneous apoptosis assay, cells were incubated for the indicated number of days, and viability was determined by the same method. Clonality Assay—Genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI and examined by Southern blot analysis using a 32P-labeled JH probe, representing the JH4 region of the IgH (20.Bichi R. Shinton S.A. Martin E.S. Koval A. Calin G.A. Cesari R. Russo G. Hardy R.R. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6955-6960Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). A DNA fragment for the probe was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-TGTGGTGACATTAGAACTGAAGTA-3′ and 5′-CAAGATTAGTCTGCAATGCTCAGA-3′. The probe was prepared using the megaprime DNA-labeling system (Amersham Biosciences). Premalignant polyclonal B cells were obtained from mice less than 3 months of age. These cells were indistinguishable from wild-type B cells except that c-myc expression was increased, and they showed increased rates of proliferation and apoptosis. Histology—Murine tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and paraffin-embedded. Four-micrometer sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Transfection of siRNA—Lymphoma cells with increased expression of Bcl-xL were grown in culture and transfected with siRNA against Bcl-xL (Pharmacon) using nucleofector buffer R and program O-17 (Amaxa Biosystems). After 12 h in culture non-viable cells were removed with the Dead Cell Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). The remaining cells were divided into two aliquots. One was incubated in cell culture medium for 24 h, and RNA was harvested. Real time RT-PCR was performed to determine the level of Bcl-xL mRNA. The other aliquot of cells was incubated with etoposide for 24 h, and the number of apoptotic cells was determined. Promoter Usage Analysis—Transcripts from the c-myc P1 promoter and total transcripts (from both P1 and P2 promoters) were measured by real time RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from purified B cells with the Rneasy mini kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was prepared using the RETROscript kit. The primers and probe for the P1 promoter were: 5′-GAGGGATCCTGAGTCGCAGTAT-3′, 5′-CTCTGCACACACGGCTCTTC-3′, and 5′-[6-FAM]AACCGTCCGCCACTCCCTCTGTCTCT-3′. The mm-myc primer-probe set was used to detect the total level of c-myc. Normalization was performed by establishing standard curves with a plasmid containing the entire murine c-myc gene. The quantity of P1 transcripts and total transcripts was then normalized to GAPDH. Generation of IgH-3′E-myc Knock-in Mice—The murine IgH 3′-enhancers HS1234 were integrated 5′ of the c-myc locus by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells using a targeting construct with two homologous arms, the 5′-flanking region of c-myc and the entire c-myc coding region (Fig. 1A). A neomycin cassette located between the arms allowed for drug selection of ES cells. The ES cell clones were screened by PCR and Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA digested with EcoRI using a probe outside of the region of homology (Fig. 1B). Two independent ES cell clones were injected to produce chimeric mice (Fig. 1B). The neomycin cassette flanked by loxP sites in the neomycin-IgH-3′E-myc knock-in mice was removed by breeding with transgenic mice expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the β-actin promoter (Fig. 1, C and D). The mice with neomycin deleted are designated as IgH-3′E-myc mice. Expression of c-myc in IgH-3′E-myc Mice—Real time RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression level of c-myc driven by the IgH 3′-enhancers in different tissues of the IgH-3′E-myc mice. As shown in Fig. 1E, except for spleen, which had elevated c-myc expression in the IgH-3′E-myc mice, the level of c-myc in brain, liver, kidney, lung, and thymus from the IgH-3′E-myc mice was not different from that of wild-type mice. To further investigate the tissue-specific expression of c-myc, splenic B lymphocytes and non-B lymphocytes (mainly T cells) from IgH-3′E-myc and wild-type mice were purified and subjected to real time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1F). We found that elevated c-myc expression was detected only in the B cell fraction and not in non-B lymphocytes. Increased c-myc expression was detected in the spleens of both heterozygous and homozygous IgH-3′E-myc mice compared with the level of expression from spleens of wild-type littermates (Fig. 1G). Protein immunoblotting also demonstrated that splenic lymphocytes from knock-in mice showed higher levels of c-Myc protein (Fig. 1H). Taken together, the IgH 3′-enhancers HS1234 appear to be B cell-specific and to increase c-Myc expression only in B cells of the IgH-3′E-myc knock-in mice. Abnormal B Cell Development in Young IgH-3′E-myc Mice—We examined the development of B and T cells in young (6 weeks–3 months) IgH-3′E-myc mice. T cell development in the thymus appeared to be normal as judged by CD4 and CD8 staining. 2J. Wang and L. M. Boxer, unpublished data. The percentage of T cells was decreased in the spleens of IgH-3′E-myc mice, but the ratio of CD4 and CD8 cells was similar to that of wild-type mice. An analysis of the spleen revealed that the percentage of B cells (CD19+ and B220+) was increased in both heterozygous and homozygous IgH-3′E-myc mice as compared with age-matched wild-type controls (Fig. 2). There was a significant increase in a B220+IgM+ IgDlow B cell population from the spleens of IgH-3′E-myc mice. Homozygous mice showed a more pronounced increase (7–10-fold) of this population. An analysis of bone marrow revealed that the IgH-3′E-myc mice had a slight increase in the B220+ IgM+ population (Fig. 2), and the percentage of the CD43+ B220+ pro-B population was not significantly different between the wild-type and IgH-3′E-myc mice. 2J. Wang and L. M. Boxer, unpublished data. Increased Proliferation of B Cells from IgH-3′E-myc Mice in Response to Activation Signals—It is known that c-Myc plays an important role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. We therefore evaluated B cell proliferation from young IgH-3′E-myc mice and age-matched wild-type mice in response to B cell antigen receptor engagement signals and to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, PMA, and ionomycin. Proliferation of splenic B cells from IgH-3′E-myc mice was ∼2-fold higher compared with wild-type B cells treated with lipopolysaccharide, PMA, PMA plus ionomycin, anti-IgM, and anti-CD40 (Fig. 3A). Further studies were performed to examine changes in the cell cycle. As shown in Fig. 3B, 24% of B cells from wild-type mice were in the S and G2/M phases after treatment with anti-CD40 for 24 h. The number of B cells in the S and G2/M phases from IgH-3′E-myc mice was increased to 47% with the same treatment. Similar results were obtained with treatment with PMA plus ionomycin (Fig. 3B). These results demonstrate that the B cells from IgH-3′E-myc mice have increased c-Myc expression and higher rates of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Development of B Cell Lymphomas in IgH-3′E-myc Mice— Profound enlargement of the spleen and lymph nodes was observed in heterozygous mice at 12 ± 2 months and in homozygous mice at 10 ± 2 months of age. Heterozygous and homozygous mice that exhibited obvious tumors or became visibly ill were necropsied. These mice displayed moderate to severe splenomegaly with a 5–12-fold increase in the weight of the spleen over wild-type littermates (Fig. 4A). Sections of tumor tissue were fixed in formalin, paraffin-embedded, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Histology showed diffuse infiltration in the spleens and lymph nodes with effacement of the normal architecture by a monomorphic population of round cells with one or few nucleoli (Fig. 4, B–D). The lymphomas from IgH-3′E-myc mice displayed a “starry sky” appearance, one of the histologic hallmarks of Burkitt's lymphoma (Fig. 4). Various degrees of infiltration of lung (Fig. 4E), kidney (Fig. 4F), and intestine2 were also observed. The majority of lymphoma cells from spleen and lymph node-derived tumors displayed a phenotype of mature B cell origin with expression of CD19+, B220+, CD22, CD79a, IgM+, and low levels of IgD.2 Further studies revealed that they were also positive for CD24, CD16/CD32, and CD38, but negative for CD23, CD34, CD3, CD4, and CD8.2 Thirty-six heterozygous IgH-3′E-myc, 30 homozygous IgH-3′E-myc, and 20 wild-type littermates were followed to record their lifespan. The IgH-3′E-myc mice showed significantly increased mortality compared with wild-type controls with a mean age of death ∼379 days for heterozygous IgH-3′E-myc mice and 314 days for the homozygous IgH-3′E-myc mice (Fig. 5A). At necropsy, all the IgH-3′E-myc mice had enlarged spleens and lymph nodes. To determine whether the lymphomas that developed in IgH-3′E-myc mice were monoclonal, we analyzed the IgH gene configuration by Southern blot analysis. DNA from spleens of age-matched wild-type control mice showed the germ line IgH band, whereas DNA from lymphomas displayed one or more discrete, rearranged bands in addition to the germ line band, indicating a clonal origin (Fig. 5B). No clonality was observed in B cells of young IgH-3′E-myc mice despite the presence of an increased population of B cells. Premalignant B Cells from IgH-3′E-myc Mice Prior to Lymphoma Development Show Increased Rates of Apoptosis—In addition to the role of c-Myc in promoting proliferation, elevated c-Myc expression in normal cells sensitizes them to apoptosis in response to many apoptotic stimuli such as deprivation of survival factors and treatment with chemotherapeutic agents (21.Soucie E.L. Annis M.G. Sedivy J. Filmus J. Leber B. Andrews D.W. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4725-4736Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We examined the rate of spontaneous apoptosis of B cells in culture without activation stimuli. As shown in Fig. 6A, there was a significant decrease in the number of viable B cells from young IgH-3′E-myc mice (premalignant B cells) compared with that of viable B cells from age-matched wild-type mice. In contrast, B cells from IgH-3′E-myc mice with lymphomas remained viable in culture for longer periods of time (Fig. 6A). To examine chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, the B cells were treated with etoposide at a range of concentrations. Again, we observed that the premalignant cells from young IgH-3′E-myc mice were more sensitive to induction of cell death compared with B cells from wild-type mice (Fig. 6B). Although the lymphoma cells were more resistant to etoposide-induced cell death than the premalignant B cells at 16 h, there was no significant difference compared with B cells from wild-type mice. Longer treatment times with etoposide revealed that the lymphoma cells were somewhat more resistant to the induction of cell death compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 6C). These results demonstrate that non-transformed B cells from IgH-3′E-mice display increased apoptosis, presumably because of high c-Myc levels, whereas this is no longer observed in the lymphoma cells, suggesting that changes in apoptotic pathways have occurred in the lymphoma cells of IgH-3′E-myc mice. IgH-3′E-myc Lymphomas Show Increased Expression of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 and Mdm2—To begin to investigate the difference in apoptosis rates in lymphoma cells compared with the premalignant cells, the levels of expression of p53, Mdm2, and several Bcl-2 family members were examined in 12 lymphoma samples by Western blot analysis. We found that all 12 lymphomas showed low levels of p53 compared with wild-type B cells and premalignant B cells (Fig. 7A). Sequence analysis of p53 cDNA reverse-transcribed from RNA of the 12 lymphomas revealed that p53 was wild-type in these lymphomas.2 In addition, there was no loss of the p53 gene in these cells.2 Seven of the lymphoma samples had increased Mdm2 expression relative to wild-type and premalignant B cells (Fig. 7A). Levels of ARF were increased in the premalignant B cells compared with wild-type and malignant cells.2 Bax expression in the lymphomas was slightly decreased compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 7A). Five of the lymphoma samples had elevated expression of Bcl-xL, and three had increased levels of Bcl-2 (Fig. 7A). These data are summarized in Fig. 7B. Further investigation of the p53 response to chemotherapy was performed. As shown in Fig. 7C, there was increased p53 expression in both wild-type and premalignant B cells in response to etoposide treatment. The lymphoma cells expressed lower levels of p53 at baseline, and there was no increase with etoposide treatment. Increased Levels of Bcl-xL Protect the IgH-3′E-myc Lymphoma Cells from Apoptosis—To further evaluate the role of increased expression of Bcl-xL in the IgH-3′E-myc lymphoma cells, siRNA was used to target Bcl-xL. The lymphoma cells could be adapted to growth in tissue culture, and the levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 remained high.2 A lymphoma sample that expressed high levels of Bcl-xL was transfected with siRNA against Bcl-xL. As shown in Fig. 8A, Bcl-xL levels were markedly decreased. Treatment of the cells expressing the Bcl-xL siRNA with etoposide resulted in increased apoptosis compared with the cells expressing a scrambled siRNA (Fig. 8B). The c-myc Promoter Shift from P2 to P1 Is Observed in Lymphoma Cells—In addition to increased expression of c-myc, a promoter shift from the normal P2 promoter to the P1 promoter is observed in Burkitt's lymphoma. We used real time RT-PCR to determine whether the P1 promoter was activated by the IgH enhancers. As expected, wild-type B cells showed predominant usage of the P2 promoter (Fig. 9). Interestingly, the premalignant B cells, which showed increased expression of c-myc, did not display activation of the P1 promoter (Fig. 9). The lymphoma cells all showed increased activity of the P1 promoter consistent with that observed in human Burkitt's lymphoma cells. We have previously identified a binding site in the c-myc promoter for a MAZ-related factor (22.Hu H.-M. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9819-9824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This site is required for the full activation of the P1 promoter in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. We examined wild-type, premalignant, and lymphoma B cells for the presence of the MAZ-related factor by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, but no differences in specific DNA binding activity were observed.2 Burkitt's lymphomas invariably contain translocations of c-myc into one of the immunoglobulin loci, and the IgH 3′ enhancers are linked to the translocated c-myc in all t(8; 14) translocations. We have used the IgH 3′-enhancers HS1234 to deregulate c-myc expression in murine B cells. The use of a gene-targeting approach avoided positional and copy number effects in our mouse model. We were able to study the function of the isolated 3′-enhancers without interference from other regulatory elements of the IgH locus. Our results demonstrate that the IgH 3′-enhancers are sufficient to deregulate c-myc expression and cause a malignancy that resembles human Burkitt's lymphoma. The morphology of the IgH-3′E-myc and Burkitt's lymphomas is similar, consisting of medium-sized cells with basophilic cytoplasm and round nuclei containing one or several nucleoli. Both malignancies show a diffuse monotonous pattern of infiltration with effacement of the normal architecture of the spleen and lymph nodes. A “starry sky” appearance is observed due to macrophages containing ingested apoptotic lymphoma cells. Burkitt's lymphoma cells express the B cell markers CD19, CD22, CD79a, and surface IgM (some also express low levels of IgD) and lack CD23, CD34, and T cell markers. The IgH-3′E-myc lymphomas express similar surface markers. The demonstration that targeting of the IgH 3′-enhancers to the c-myc locus results in a B cell malignancy suggests that these enhancers play a crucial role in deregulating c-myc and in the development of lymphoma. However, it is possible that other regulatory elements cooperate with the IgH 3′-enhancers to deregulate c-myc in human Burkitt's lymphoma. The murine IgH 3′-enhancers span a 25-kb region (13.Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Other unidentified sites in addition to the four HS sites in the IgH 3′-region may contribute to c-myc deregulation. It is also possible that the IgH 3′-enhancers interact with other regulatory elements in the IgH locus, such as with Eμ or with the δ-γ3 interval enhancer, to activate c-myc expression in Burkitt's lymphoma. In endemic Burkitt's subtypes, c-myc is often translocated into the IgH-joining region and is juxtaposed in cis with the Eμ enhancer. Another regulatory region in the IgH δ-γ3 interval showed B cell-specific enhancer function and was likely active in early B cell development (23.Mundt C.A. Nicholson I.C. Zou X. Popov A.V. Ayling C. Bruggemann M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 3315-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These considerations might explain in part the long latent period before tumor development in our IgH-3′E-myc mice, although clearly other mutations in addition to c-myc deregulation are required for lymphomagenesis. In addition to increased c-myc expression in the presence of the IgH 3′-enhancers, we also observed increased activity of the c-myc P1 promoter. This is consistent with the promoter shift that is seen in human Burkitt's lymphoma cells. Previous studies in cell lines had suggested that the 3′-IgH enhancers were sufficient to cause the c-myc promoter shift from P2 to P1 (13.Madisen L. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2212-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 14.Kanda K. Hu H.-M. Zhang L. Grandchamps J. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32338-32346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was somewhat surprising to observe that premalignant B cells maintained the normal c-myc promoter usage despite the presence of the 3′-IgH enhancers and high level c-Myc expression. The mechanisms involved in the induction of the promoter shift are not understood. We have shown previously that a MAZ-related transcription factor was required for the activation of the P1 promoter by the IgH 3′-enhancers. There were no differences in the DNA binding activity of this factor in cells with or without the promoter shift, so further studies will be required to identify the factors that are necessary for the activation of the P1 promoter. Based on the finding that the premalignant cells from the IgH-3′E-myc mice are more sensitive to apoptosis compared with the lymphoma cells, it is likely that mutations in the apoptotic pathways occur during the development of this lymphoma. Other cell line and animal models support the concept that anti-apoptotic mutations collaborate with c-Myc in malignant transformation, for example (8.Eischen C.M. Packham G. Nip J. Fee B.E. Hiebert S.W. Zambetti G.P. Cleveland J.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6983-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 24.Wagner A.J. Small M.B. Hay N. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5063-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The ARF-p53-Mdm2 pathway is frequently inactivated in c-Myc-induced tumors (27.Eischen C.M. Weber J.D. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Cleveland J.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 28.Lindstrom M.S. Klangby U. Wiman K.G. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2171-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 29.Capoulade C. Bressac-de Paillerets B. Lefrere I. Ronsin M. Feunteun J. Tursz T. Wiels J. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1603-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The lymphomas from the IgH-3′E-myc mice showed low levels of p53 expression without deletion of the p53 gene, and no mutations in the p53 gene were observed. In addition, there was no increase in p53 expression in response to a chemotherapeutic agent. More than half of the lymphomas showed high level expression of Mdm2, which interferes with p53 function by facilitating its degradation. These results are similar to those observed in primary human Burkitt's lymphoma samples. Overexpression of Mdm2 was observed in 10 of 24 samples (30.Wilda M. Bruch J. Harder L. Rawer D. Reiter A. Borkhardt A. Woessmann W. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2004; 18: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reduced expression of ARF was not detected in any of the samples, and 4 of 24 samples showed p53 mutations (30.Wilda M. Bruch J. Harder L. Rawer D. Reiter A. Borkhardt A. Woessmann W. Leukemia (Basingstoke). 2004; 18: 584-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus 55% of the cases of sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma showed inactivation of the ARF-p53-Mdm2 pathway, which is similar to the 58% of the IgH-3′E-myc lymphomas with overexpression of Mdm2. Increased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins was observed in two-thirds of the IgH-3′E-myc lymphomas. Bcl-xL was most commonly up-regulated (5 of 12 lymphomas), and three additional lymphomas showed increased Bcl-2 expression. We demonstrated that the increased levels of Bcl-xL resulted in decreased sensitivity of the lymphoma cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis. None of the lymphoma samples showed increased Mcl-1 levels compared with wild-type or premalignant B cells.2 In general, Bax levels were somewhat lower in the lymphoma cells than in the wild-type or premalignant cells. Our results are consistent with reports demonstrating that anti-apoptotic proteins cooperate with c-Myc to induce malignant transformation. Myc has been reported to suppress the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (26.Eischen C.M. Woo D. Roussel M.F. Cleveland J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5063-5070Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Although the premalignant B cells from the IgH-3′E-myc mice were more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis, we did not consistently observe lower levels of Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 compared with wild-type B cells. In summary, we have shown that the IgH 3′-enhancers deregulate c-myc expression and cause lymphomagenesis in murine B cells. This lymphoma has a number of similarities to human Burkitt's lymphoma and will allow investigations into the mechanisms involved in c-myc deregulation and provide a preclinical model for testing therapeutics."

These clocks are found throughout the animal kingdom, as well as in plants and even in prokaryotes. Molecular mechanisms for circadian rhythms are based on transcriptional oscillation of clock component genes, consisting of interwoven autoregulatory feedback loops. Among the loops, the nuclear transport of clock proteins is a crucial step for transcriptional regulation. In the present study, we showed that the nuclear entry of mCRY2, a mammalian clock component, is mediated by the importin α/β system through a bipartite nuclear localization signal in its carboxyl end. In vitro transport assay using digitonin-permeabilized cells demonstrated that all three importin αs, α1 (Rch1), α3 (Qip-1), and α7 (NPI-2), can mediate mCRY2 import. mCRY2 with the mutant nuclear localization signal failed to transport mPER2 into the nucleus of mammalian cultured cells, indicating that the nuclear localization signal identified in mCRY2 is physiologically significant. These results suggest that the importin α/β system is involved in nuclear entry of mammalian clock components, which is indispensable to transcriptional oscillation of clock genes.

These results suggest that the importin α/β system is involved in nuclear entry of mammalian clock components, which is indispensable to transcriptional oscillation of clock genes. Circadian rhythms, periodicities with a near 24-h length, constitute a fundamental physiological function that is seen in nearly all organisms from prokaryotes to humans. The circadian system is generally viewed as consisting of three components: input, oscillator, and output. The input or entraining signal is most often light but can also be other environmental cues, such as temperature, feeding, and social cues. In mammals, the light signals acting on the ganglion cells of the retina are conveyed through the retinohypothalamic tract to the suprachiasmatic nuclei in the anterior hypothalamus, which is a major circadian center. The clock's output drives different kinds of physiological phenomenon including locomotor activity, sleep-wake cycles, and hormonal secretion. The disturbance of circadian rhythms causes, not only sleep-wake disorders, but likely also cardiovascular diseases, psychiatric disorders, cancers, and many other diseases (1.Hastings M.H. Reddy A.B. Maywood E.S. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2003; 4: 649-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), as well as contemporary social problems, such as jet lag, and can be the result of shift work. Recent findings indicate that mutations of clock genes cause abnormal behaviors in vivo from fly to humans. The first clock mutant, period in Drosophila, was identified as a period gene (2.Konopka R.J. Benzer S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1971; 68: 2112-2116Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar, 3.Allada R. Emery P. Takahashi J.S. Rosbash M. Annu. Rev.

A missense mutation of human Per2 causes a specific disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle, known as familial advanced sleep phase syndrome (5.Toh K.L. Jones C.R. He Y. Eide E.J. Hinz W.A. Virshup D.M. Ptacek L.J. Fu Y.H. Science. 2001; 291: 1040-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). Perhaps one of the most surprising results, after the identification of clock genes, is that a molecular clock resides, not only in the suprachiasmatic nuclei in mammals, but also in peripheral tissues and even in the immortalized cells (6.Takumi T. Matsubara C. Shigeyoshi Y. Taguchi K. Yagita K. Maebayashi Y. Sakakida Y. Okumura K. Takashima N. Okamura H. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 7.Balsalobre A. Damiola F. Schibler U. Cell. 1998; 93: 929-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1550) Google Scholar). It is now generally accepted that molecular mechanisms of the circadian rhythms are based on the interlocked autoregulatory feedback loops of the transcription of the clock genes (3.Allada R. Emery P. Takahashi J.S. Rosbash M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1091-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 4.Young M.W. Kay S.A. Nat. Rev.

Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar). Murine mCRY1 and mCRY2, two mammalian cryptochromes, were originally thought to be the circadian photoreceptor but are now considered as negative elements of mPER/mCRY feedback loops (10.Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 31-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 11.Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34079-34082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Mice lacking the mCRY1 or mCRY2 display accelerated and delayed free running periodicity of locomotor activity, respectively (12.Thresher R.J. Vitaterna M.H. Miyamoto Y. Kazantsev A. Hsu D.S.

In the absence of both proteins, an instantaneous and complete loss of free running rhythmicity is observed (13.van der Horst G.T. Muijtjens M. Kobayashi K. Takano R. Kanno S. Takao M. de Wit J. Verkerk A. Eker A.P. van Leenen D. Buijs R. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H. Yasui A. Nature. 1999; 398: 627-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar, 14.Vitaterna M.H. Selby C.P. Todo T. Niwa H.

A. 1999; 96: 12114-12119Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), indicating mCRY1 and mCRY2 are likely core molecules of circadian clocks, as described above. Furthermore, mouse mCRY1 and mCRY2 seem to pull the circadian oscillator in opposing directions (15.Oster H. Yasui A. van der Horst G.T. Albrecht U. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both mammalian mCRY1 and mCRY2 inhibit BMAL1/CLOCK-dependent transcriptional activation through E-boxes in the mPer/mCry promoters by their nuclear entry together with mPER1 and mPER2 (9.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar, 16.Kume K. Zylka M.J. Sriram S. Shearman L.P. Weaver D.R. Jin X. Maywood E.S. Hastings M.H. Reppert S.M.

Analysis of clock proteins in mCRY-deficient mice showed that mCRYs are necessary for stabilizing phosphorylated mPER2 and for the nuclear accumulation of mPER1, mPER2, and casein kinase Iϵ (CKIϵ) 1The abbreviations used are: CKIϵ, casein kinase Iϵ; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, maltose-binding protein; IBB, importin β binding domain of importin α; WT, wild type; CKI, casein kinase I; Ran, Ras-related nuclear protein; MT, mutant. 1The abbreviations used are: CKIϵ, casein kinase Iϵ; NLS, nuclear localization signal; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; HA, hemagglutinin; DTT, dithiothreitol; MBP, maltose-binding protein; IBB, importin β binding domain of importin α; WT, wild type; CKI, casein kinase I; Ran, Ras-related nuclear protein; MT, mutant.

Therefore, nuclear entry of the mPER and mCRY proteins is a vital checkpoint for progression of the clockwork cycle (9.Reppert S.M. Weaver D.R. Nature. 2002; 418: 935-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (3334) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in mouse PER1 (mPER1), rat PER2 (rPER2), zebra fish CRY1 (zCRY1), and Xenopus CRY1 (xCRY1) have so far been identified (20.Vielhaber E. Eide E. Rivers A. Gao Z.H.

Biol. 2003; 13: 1653-1658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); however, it is still unclear whether nuclear entry is achieved via importin/karyopherin binding to NLS within the clock molecules or via other mechanisms. In no species is there detailed information on the nuclear entry of CRY2. Nuclear transport of proteins occurs through nuclear pore complexes and typically requires a specific NLS (24.Yoneda Y. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It has been known that there exist many different ways of nuclear transport. One transport pathway is mediated by the importin β-like transport receptor family molecule via importin α family molecules. In contrast to a single gene for importin β in mammals, importin α constitutes a multigene family, and the family can be classified into three distinct subgroups: α1 (Rch1), α3 (Qip-1), and α5 (NPI-1) (25.Kohler M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A small GTPase Ran ensures the direction of nuclear transport by regulating the interaction between the receptors and their cargoes through its GTP/GDP cycle. Alternative nuclear import pathways have been described in which the NLS-containing proteins directly bind one of the nuclear import receptors of the importin-β superfamily without interaction with importin α (27.Nagoshi E.

Fragments amplified by PCR using the primers above (PKRK-F and PKRK-Rv for mutation from PKRK to PAAA, KRAR-F and KRAR-Rv for mutation from KRAR to AAAA) as a template of mCRY2-FLAG were digested with KpnI and XhoI and subcloned to the XhoI site of the mCRY2-FLAG plasmid. Further, a double mutant (PAAA AAAA) was made using primers KRAR-F and KRAR-Rv as a template of mCRY2-FLAG PKRK mutant. For NLS1 peptide-type mutants, after annealing with each forward and reverse primer (KKVKR(WT)-F and KKVKR(WT)-R, KKVKR(MT)-F and KKVKR(MT)-R, respectively) at 99 °C for 2 min, at 72 °C for 5 min, and at room temperature for 3 h, the fragments were digested with EcoRI and BamHI and subcloned to pEGFPx3. In the case of NLS2 peptide-type mutants, using primers F5 and R1, amplified fragments of the full-length mutants were used as templates. Antibodies—Rabbit anti-importin α3 (Qip-1) polyclonal antibodies were prepared as described previously (33.Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal anti-importin α1 (Rch1/karyopherin α2) and anti-importin α5 (NPI-1/karyopherin α1), mouse monoclonal anti-importin β, murine IgG1 monoclonal anti-FLAG M2, and anti-HA antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, BD Biosciences, Kodak, and Clontech, respectively. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Escherichia coli strain JM109, which had been transformed with pGEX mCRY2-FL, was grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to a density of 0.6 (A600). Expression was induced by adding isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (to 0.1 mm final concentration) and then incubating for 18 h at 20 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 500 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), using a 125 volume of the original cell culture. After one freezethaw cycle, the cells were lysed by a French pressure cell press (Thermo Spectronic, 1000 psi) and sonication after adding 10 mm MgATP and 5 mg/ml casein to dissociate GroEL for 20 min at room temperature. After the extract was clarified by centrifugation, the extract was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min at room temperature. The recombinant protein-bound Sepharose was washed extensively with wash buffer I (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 500 mm NaCl) and with buffer II (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.4, 50 mm NaCl) and then incubated with Prescission protease (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for overnight. The recombinant mCRY2-FLAG cleaved from the GST moiety was collected from the flow-through of a Polyprep chromatography column (Bio-Rad). The flow-through was subjected to chromatography on a HiTrap-SP cation exchange column (1-ml) on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min using a linear gradient from 0.05 to 1 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture. Peak fractions containing mCRY2-FLAG (eluted between 0.3 and 0.5 mm NaCl) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration using a microconYM-50 column (Millipore). To see purity, the protein concentrated was eluted by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Expression and purification of mouse importin β (PTAC97) was performed as described previously (34.Kose S. Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Shimamoto T. Yoneda Y. J.

Transfection and Microinjection—For transfection, NIH3T3 or COS7 cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) as described previously (37.Takumi T. Nagamine Y. Miyake S. Matsubara C. Taguchi K. Takekida S. Sakakida Y. Nishikawa K. Kishimoto T. Niwa S. Okumura K. Okamura H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For microinjection, NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and plated on coverslips 36–48 h before use. Proteins were injected through a glass capillary into the cytoplasm using a micromanipulator (Narishige MMO-202N, Tokyo, Japan). After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C or on ice, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. To examine the localization of the injected proteins, fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at room temperature, incubated with 3% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min, and then incubated with 30 μg/ml monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The mouse antibody was detected with Cy3-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences). All samples were examined by Axiophot microscopy (Zeiss). In Vitro Binding Assay—Solution binding assay for recombinant NLS receptors was performed as described previously (27.Nagoshi E. Imamoto N. Sato R. Yoneda Y. Mol. Biol.

Each GST or GST fusion protein was immobilized on 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B and mixed with 100 pmol of affinity-purified recombinant Rch1, Qip-1, NPI-2, or importin β, and total reaction volume was adjusted to 100 μl with 25% bovine serum albumin in transport buffer (TB) (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm sodium acetate, and 0.5 mm EGTA). After incubation for 1 h at 4 °C, materials bound were washed with TB and eluted with 0.2% SDS in TB for 5 min at 100 °C. Immunoblotting with anti-Rch1, anti-NPI-1 (cross-reacted with NPI-2), or anti-Qip-1 antibodies was performed as described previously (33.Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T.

Cell. 1999; 10: 2221-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cells/ml on an eight-well multitest slide (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) 36–48 h before use. The cells grown on slides were rinsed twice in ice-cold TB and permeabilized for 5 min in ice-cold TB containing 40 μg/ml digitonin (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan; diluted from a 20 mg/ml stock solution in Me2SO), 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture. After removing the digitonin-containing buffer, the slides were washed and immersed in ice-cold TB containing 2 mm DTT and protease inhibitor mixture for 10 min. The slides were then blotted to remove excess buffer, and 11 μl of reaction mixture/single well were applied to the cell. Import reactions were performed by incubating the slides for 30 min at 30 °C, unless otherwise described. After incubation, the cells were rinsed twice in TB and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in TB for 15 min at room temperature. Each reaction mixture contained an import substrate combined with cytosol or a combination of recombinant transport factors in the presence or absence of an ATP regeneration system (1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, and 20 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). Total cytosol from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was prepared as described previously (38.Imamoto N. Tachibana T. Matsubae M. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8559-8565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (37.Takumi T. Nagamine Y. Miyake S. Matsubara C. Taguchi K. Takekida S. Sakakida Y. Nishikawa K. Kishimoto T. Niwa S. Okumura K. Okamura H. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). At 48 h post-transfection, lysates were prepared at 4 °C and dialyzed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 2 mm DTT, and protease inhibitor mixture). After washing with phosphate-buffered saline three times, 0.4 μg of mouse anti-FLAG M2 and protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) were added and rotated at 4 °C overnight. After rinsing with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer three times, the supernatant was analyzed on 4–20% SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG M2 or anti-HA monoclonal antibody using the Western Lighting Chemiluminescence Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To examine the molecular mechanism for the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of mCRY2, we purified the recombinant protein of mCRY2-FLAG (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, when mCRY2-FLAG was microinjected into the cell cytoplasm of the NIH3T3 cells, nuclear import of mCRY2 protein was observed and localized in the nucleus (99% in the nucleus, n = 96) 30 min after injection, which is consistent with previous studies (12.Thresher R.J. Vitaterna M.H. Miyamoto Y. Kazantsev A. Hsu D.S. Petit C. Selby C.P. Dawut L. Smithies O. Takahashi J.S. Sancar A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5086-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The nuclear transport of mCRY2 was hindered on ice (97% in the cytoplasm, n = 36) or by co-injection with wheat germ agglutinin (100% in the cytoplasm, n = 36), suggesting that the import appears to be temperature-dependent and sensitive to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin, which inhibits many nuclear transport mechanisms without affecting passive diffusion through the nuclear pore complex by binding to N-acetylglucosamine-modified nucleoporins (40.Finlay D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Price T.M. Forbes D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 41.Yoneda Y. Imamoto-Sonobe N. Yamaizumi M. Uchida T. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 173: 586-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To study further the involvement of small GTPase Ran in the nuclear import of mCRY2, we used a Q69L Ran mutant, which is deficient in GTPase activity and remains in the GTP-bound state, even in the presence of cytoplasmic RanGAP1 (42.Carey K.L. Richards S.A. Lounsbury K.M. Macara I.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 985-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The nuclear transport of mCRY2 was dependent on Ran-GDP (99% in the nucleus, n = 97), which is essential for nuclear cytoplasmic transport across the nuclear envelope (43.Gorlich D. Henklein P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar), whereas co-injection with the dominant negative Ran-GTP inhibited the nuclear localization of mCRY2 (86% in the cytoplasm, n = 110), indicating that the nuclear import of mCRY2 is dependent on a gradient of Ran-GTP across the nuclear envelope. Our results suggest that nuclear localization of mCRY2 is not passive but is dependent on the Ran-GTP-motive nuclear trans-location. We next targeted the putative NLS in the mCRY2 sequence. In the primary structure of mCRY1, one putative NLS is located in the middle of the sequence. On the other hand, there are two candidate NLS sequences in mCRY2; one is a monopartite type NLS (NLS1) in the middle of the protein (amino acid 292–296), which is conserved between mCRY1 and mCRY2, and another is a bipartite-type NLS (NLS2) in the carboxyl-terminal end (amino acid 558–578), which is not conserved in mCRY1 (Fig. 2A). We fused the wild-type or mutant NLSs to GFPx3 and transfected them into NIH3T3 cells to observe the subcellular localization (Fig. 2B). Both the wild-type NLS1 (KKVKR) and mutant NLS1 (AAVAA) did not show clearly different behavior and were seen in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (83 and 84% in the nucleus and cytoplasm, n = 72 and n = 68, respectively), whereas pEGFPx3 (trimer of EGFP), as a negative control, stayed mostly in the cytoplasm (98% in the cytoplasm, n = 123). By contrast, the cellular localization of NLS2 was obviously different between the wild type and mutants. The wild-type NLS2 (PKRK KRAR) was localized to the nucleus (99% in the nucleus, n = 223), whereas the mutant NLS2 (PAAA KRAR or PKRK AAAA) diffused in the whole cell (94% or 95% in the nucleus and cytoplasm, n = 108 and n = 145, respectively), and the double mutant NLS2 (PAAA AAAA) was localized to the cytoplasm (94% in the cytoplasm, n = 142). Moreover, the recombinant mCRY2 proteins, which fused FLAG with wild-type or mutant NLS2s, were purified and microinjected into the cytoplasm of NIH3T3 cells to determine their subcellular localization (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the results of transfection with NLS2-GFPs as described above, mCRY2-FLAG proteins with wild-type NLS2 (PKRK KRAR) were localized to the nucleus (98% in the nucleus, n = 448), whereas those with the mutant NLS2 (PAAA KRAR or PKRK AAAA) diffused in the cell (both 96% in the nucleus and cytoplasm, n = 290 and n = 338, respectively), and those with the double mutant NLS2 (PAAA AAAA) were localized to the cytoplasm (86% in the cytoplasm, n = 408). These findings clearly indicate that NLS2 functionally works as an NLS of mCRY2. To investigate the requirements of any factors on nuclear transport of mCRY2, we subjected the FLAG-tagged mCRY2 to an in vitro cell-free transport assay using the permeabilized HeLa cells. In this assay, the cytoplasmic membrane is first permeabilized with digitonin, and the soluble endogenous cytosolic factors are depleted. Nuclear entry of a fluorescently labeled protein can be studied in the presence or absence of exogenous nuclear import factors. In a condition where GST alone gave no"
https://openalex.org/W2036647990,"Estrogen is critical to both normal mammary gland and breast cancer development. Circulating levels of estrogen in premenopausal women are primarily determined by the action of aromatase in ovarian granulosa cells that converts testosterone to estradiol. In the current study, we unraveled an important role of Jun proteins in modulating ovary-specific aromatase expression. Ectopic expression of the Jun proteins in a human granulosa cell line significantly inhibited an ovary-specific promoter (PII) of the aromatase gene, whereas expression of dominant-negative mutants of Jun led to increased promoter activity. The Jun-mediated repression was specific to the aromatase promoter, as Jun proteins stimulated known AP1-responsive promoters in the same cellular context. Both the activation and basic leucine zipper domains of Jun were required for the transcriptional repression. Electrophoretic gel mobility assay showed that endogenous Jun proteins bound to a functionally important cAMP-responsive element (CRE) in the PII promoter-proximal region. Alteration of the CRE-like site impaired both the cAMP-responsive transcriptional activation and Jun-mediated repression. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated the presence of cJun at the proximal region of the native PII promoter. Taken together, our work suggests that Jun proteins may attenuate estrogen biosynthesis by directly downregulating transcription of the aromatase gene in ovarian granulosa cells."
https://openalex.org/W1997702818,"Deregulation of MYC expression occurs in many haematological malignancies. Previous studies modelling MYC-induced lymphomagenesis in the mouse used transgenic vectors that directed MYC overexpression in a lineage-specific manner. Here, we describe a transgenic mouse strain in which constitutive MYC expression is driven broadly in haemopoiesis by a vector containing regulatory elements of the Vav gene. Healthy young VavP-MYC17 mice had multiple haemopoietic abnormalities, most notably increased size and numbers of B-lymphoid cells, monocytes and megakaryocytes. The mice rapidly developed tumours and, surprisingly, these were exclusively T-cell lymphomas, mostly of mature CD4(+) CD8(-) T cells, a tumour type that is seldom seen in mouse models. To examine tumour development in the absence of the susceptible T cells, we bred VavP-MYC17 mice lacking the Rag1 recombinase. They survived longer and succumbed to tumours of several different haemopoietic cell types: pre-T cells, pro-B cells, macrophages and unusual progenitor cells. Thus, although T-lineage cells have the shortest latent period to transformation, the VavP-MYC17 transgene drives malignant transformation of multiple cell types and VavP-MYC17 mice provide a new model for tumours of multiple haemopoietic lineages."
https://openalex.org/W1992315035,"At low concentrations, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a positive endogenous regulator of mammalian cell proliferation and survival; however, the signal transduction pathways involved in these processes are poorly understood. In primary human endothelial cells, low concentrations of H2O2 stimulated the rapid phosphorylation of the acidic C-terminal domain (ACD) of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP-C), a nuclear restricted pre-mRNA-binding protein, at Ser240 and at Ser225–Ser228. A kinase activity was identified in mouse liver that phosphorylates the ACD of hnRNP-C at Ser240 and at two sites at Ser225–Ser228. The kinase was purified and identified by tandem mass spectrometry as protein kinase CK1α (formerly casein kinase 1α). Protein kinase CK1α immunoprecipitated from primary human endothelial cell nuclei also phosphorylated the ACD of hnRNP-C at these positions. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with the protein kinase CK1-specific inhibitor IC261 prevented the H2O2-stimulated phosphorylation of hnRNP-C. Utilizing phosphoserine-mimicking Ser-to-Glu point mutations, the effects of phosphorylation on hnRNP-C function were investigated by quantitative equilibrium fluorescence RNA binding analyses. Wild-type hnRNP-C1 and hnRNP-C1 modified at the basal sites of phosphorylation (S247E and S286E) both avidly bound RNA with similar binding constants. In contrast, hnRNP-C1 that was also modified at the CK1α phosphorylation sites exhibited a 14–500-fold decrease in binding affinity, demonstrating that CK1α-mediated phosphorylation modulates the mRNA binding ability of hnRNP-C.

Application of low concentrations (<10 μm)ofH2O2 to cultured mammalian cells stimulates cell growth and enhances survival, whereas the application of catalase inhibits proliferation and stimulates cell death. In mammalian systems, H2O2 is generated by plasma membrane NADPH oxidases in response to growth factor stimulation (4Lambeth J.D. Cheng G. Arnold R.S. Edens W.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 459-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 5Griendling K.K. Sorescu D. Ushio-Fukai M. Circ.

In contrast to the effects of low concentrations of H2O2, the application of higher concentrations (>20 μm) of H2O2 to cultured cells results in oxidative stress and generally inhibits cell proliferation and stimulates cell death. Although several stress-responsive pathways have been implicated in the response of mammalian cells to oxidative stress, the biochemical mechanisms by which low concentrations of H2O2 stimulate cell proliferation and enhance survival are poorly understood (6Stone J.R.

BioEssays. 1996; 18: 747-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Deletion of the gene for hnRNP-C1/C2 in the mouse is lethal, with developmental arrest at the egg cylinder stage (10Williamson D.J. Banik-Maiti S. DeGregori J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4094-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Murine stem cells lacking hnRNP-C1/C2 are viable, but show impaired survival and decreased rates of proliferation and differentiation. Interestingly, heterologous expression of the gene for hnRNP-C1/C2 in yeast cells, which normally lack this gene, is also lethal (11Tan J-H. Kajiwara Y. Shahied L. Li J. McAfee J.G. LeStourgeon W.M.

In this latter case, it appears that heterologously expressed hnRNP-C1/C2 translocates to the yeast nucleus and binds mRNA. However, yeast cells appear to lack the ability to stimulate the release of hnRNP-C1/C2 from the mRNA, resulting in inhibition of mRNA export from the nucleus.Structurally, hnRNP-C1/C2 isolated from HeLa cells is a heterotetramer (C13C2) in which C1 and C2 are splice variants of the same gene, differing by the presence of an additional 13 amino acids in C2 (12Barnett S.F.

RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 1139-1152PubMed Google Scholar). Next is a leucine zipper (residues 180–207), which mediates subunit interactions in the heterotetramer (16Shahied L. Braswell E.H. LeStourgeon W.M. Krezel A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 817-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Finally, there is an acidic C-terminal domain (ACD; residues 208–290), which is the major site of phosphorylation in the protein (17Stone J.R. Maki J.L. Collins T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previous tandem mass spectrometry phosphate mapping studies utilizing endogenously phosphorylated protein from human endothelial cells revealed that, under basal conditions, hnRNP-C1/C2 is phosphorylated at Ser247 and Ser286 (17Stone J.R. Maki J.L. Collins T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Low concentrations of H2O2 stimulate phosphorylation at Ser240 and at a series of 4 contiguous serine residues at positions 225–228.Previous studies have implicated protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase 2) as phosphorylating Ser247, one of the basal sites of phosphorylation (17Stone J.R. Maki J.L. Collins T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the kinase responsible for the H2O2-stimulated phosphorylation has been unclear, as has the effect of this phosphorylation on the function of hnRNP-C. Here, we report that protein kinase CK1α (formerly casein kinase 1α), a kinase implicated in regulating cell cycle progression and pre-mRNA processing (18Gross S.D. Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2647-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Vielhaber E. Virshup D.M. IUBMB Life. 2001; 51: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 20Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), mediates the H2O2-stimulated phosphorylation of hnRNP-C. Furthermore, we show that this CK1α-mediated phosphorylation modulates the RNA binding activity of hnRNP-C.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression and Purification of hnRNP-C ACDs—A DNA segment containing residues 217–293 of hnRNP-C1 was amplified from a nearly full-length clone of hnRNP-C1 (Invitrogen) using the PCR. The wild-type ACD was mutated using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) to generate the double mutant S247E,S286E (ACD-2E) as well as the triple mutant S240E,S247E,S286E (ACD-3E). The amplified fragments corresponding to ACD, ACD-2E, and ACD-3E were each subcloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences). Automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the constructs verified the authenticity of the inserts. The predicted protein products consisted of the ACD of hnRNP-C fused to glutathione S-transferase (GST). For the wild-type ACD, the amino acid sequence of the final protein product after cleavage from GST with thrombin consists of 79 residues, GSNDKSEEEQSSSSVKKDETNVKMESEGGADDSAEEGDLLDDDDNEDRGDDQLELIKDDEKEAEEGEDDRDSANGEDDS, corresponding to hnRNP-C1 residues Asn217–Ser293 preceded by “GS.” Ser residues mutated to Glu in the ACD-2E and/or ACD-3E construct are in boldface underlined type.Escherichia coli BL21 cells (Novagen) transformed with the pGEX-hnRNP-C fusion construct were grown to A600 = 0.6 at 37 °C and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 1–2 h. The cells were pelleted at 4000 × g for 30 min and then suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (67 mm phosphate and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Roche Applied Science), and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/50 ml; Roche Applied Science) at 180 ml/6 liters of culture. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 30 min. Glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the resulting supernatant (0.75 ml of resin/1 liter of culture). The supernatant was then agitated on a rocker for 20 min and centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was removed, and the resin was placed in a chromatography column and washed with 2 bed volumes of Tris-buffered saline (5 mm Tris and 125 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 5 mm DTT. The resin was then incubated overnight at 25 °C as a 50% slurry with thrombin (80 units/0.75 ml of resin). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The resin was washed with 1 bed volume of Tris-buffered saline, and the eluate was concentrated to 0.5 ml with a Centriprep YM-3 concentrator (3000-Da molecular mass cutoff; Amicon, Inc.) at 3000 × g. The sample was then applied to a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 size exclusion chromatography column (10 × 300 mm; Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm MgCl2 at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min using a BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system (Bio-Rad). The concentrations of the purified ACD constructs were determined by spectrophotometric analysis using ϵ = 31 (mg/ml)-1 cm-1 at 205 nm in 0.01% (v/v) Brij 35 (Sigma).Purification of an hnRNP-C Kinase from Mouse Liver—Mouse liver (25 livers, ∼30 g; Pel-Freez Biologicals) was homogenized in 80 ml of cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm DTT and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/50 ml) using a food processor. All subsequent steps were at 4 °C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 30 min. To the supernatant was added 6 ml of red-agarose chromatography resin (Sigma). The resin was sedimented by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min and then washed three times each with 100 ml of Tris-buffered saline containing 5 mm DTT. hnRNP-C kinase activity was eluted from the resin using 12 ml of 50 mm Tris, 1.25 m NaCl, and 5 mm DTT, pH 7.4. The sample was then diluted 1:20 with water and applied to an UNO-Q anion exchange column (Bio-Rad) using a BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system. The protein was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (50 mm to 1.0 m) in 50 mm Tris and 5 mm DTT, pH 7.4. Fractions containing hnRNP-C kinase activity (see below) were pooled and diluted 1:3 with water (final concentration of 5 ml). The partially purified kinase was mixed with 0.7 ml of glutathione-Sepharose containing 2 mg of GST-ACD-2E fusion protein (see above). The slurry was brought to 5 mm MgCl2,10mm NaNO3, and 0.2 mm ADP and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. The slurry was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was removed. The resin was washed twice with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris and 5 mm DTT, pH 7.4. hnRNP-C kinase activity was then eluted by incubating the resin for 16 h at 4 °C with 5 ml of 50 mm Tris, 5 mm DTT, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. The sample was concentrated to 100 μl by centrifugation at 3000 × g with a Centricon YM-3 centrifugal concentrating device (Amicon, Inc.). The sample was then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the entire sample lane was analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry following tryptic in-gel digestion (see below).In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Samples were assayed for hnRNP-C kinase activity by incubating aliquots with 5 μg of purified recombinant ACD-2E or ACD-3E in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at 37 °C in a reaction volume of 50 μl. Reactions were quenched after1hbythe addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing β-mercaptoethanol. For a positive control on the autoradiographs, the wild-type ACD was phosphorylated in vitro using these same conditions along with 0.5 units of protein kinase CK2 (Roche Applied Science). Samples were then subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on a 4–20% polyacrylamide gel. After exposure, film was developed using an Eastman Kodak X-Omat processor.Endothelial Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were purchased from Cambrex and cultured as described previously (7Stone J.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15621-15628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). HUVECs were grown to confluency in 10-cm dishes at passage 3 in M199 medium (Cambrex) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma). 48 h after reaching confluence, the endothelial cells in M199 medium with fetal calf serum, heparin, and endothelial cell growth supplement were incubated in the absence or presence of 5 μm H2O2 for 20 min at 37 °C with or without pretreatment with 100 μm IC261 (Calbiochem) for 3 h prior to H2O2 stimulation. After treatment, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline; harvested by scraping in 10 mm Tris, 140 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0; and pelleted by spinning at 500 × g for 15 min. The cells were resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, 750 μm spermidine, 150 μm spermine, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet/50 ml), pH 7.9 (Buffer A), containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40; incubated on ice for 10 min; and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and the nuclear pellet was washed once with 0.8 ml of Buffer A.Immunoprecipitation of Protein Kinase CK1α—HUVEC nuclei were lysed by application of 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris and 1 m NaCl, pH 7.4, with incubation on ice for 20 min. The samples were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were diluted with an equal volume of water and centrifuged again at 16,000 × g for 10 min. The nuclear extracts were incubated with 40 μl of agarose-conjugated anti-CK1α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) for 1 h at 4 °C. The resin was then isolated by centrifugation at 400 × g for 5 min. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of 20 mm Tris and 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, followed by one wash with 1 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The final washed resin was analyzed for hnRNP-C kinase activity as described above.Two-dimensional Immunoblots—HUVEC nuclei were resuspended in isoelectric focusing (IEF) sample buffer (9 m urea, 65 mm DTT, 1% CHAPS, and 0.1% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte (Bio-Rad)) using 100 μl/106 cells. The suspension was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min, and the resulting supernatant was then applied to a Bio-Spin 6 chromatography column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with IEF sample buffer, followed by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 4 min. These desalted nuclear extracts were subjected to IEF using a PROTEAN IEF cell and 17-cm Ready-Strip IPG strips (Bio-Rad), which covered the pH range of 4–7. Upon completion of IEF, the ReadyStrip IPG strips were incubated first with equilibration buffer (375 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 2% SDS, and 20% glycerol, pH 8.8) containing 130 mm DTT for 10 min and then with equilibration buffer containing 135 mm iodoacetamide for 10 min. The strips were placed on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) and electrophoresed at 200 V. Gels were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and the membranes were probed for hnRNP-C1/C2 using anti-hnRNP-C polyclonal primary antibody (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) and peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:5000 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Blots were developed using ECL Plus chemiluminescence detection kits (Amersham Biosciences).Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Gel portions were subjected to tryptic in-gel digestion, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of the extracted peptides as described previously (17Stone J.R. Maki J.L. Collins T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Specifically, excised gel portions were cut into ∼1-mm3 pieces. Gel pieces were washed and dehydrated with acetonitrile for 10 min, followed by removal of acetonitrile. Pieces were then completely dried in a SpeedVac. Rehydration of the gel pieces was with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution containing 12.5 ng/μl modified sequencing grade trypsin (Promega) at 4 °C. After 45 min, the excess trypsin solution was removed and replaced with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate solution to just cover the gel pieces. The samples were then placed overnight in a 37 °C room. Peptides were later extracted by removing the ammonium bicarbonate solution, followed by two washes, for 20 min each, with a solution containing 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. The extracts were then dried in a SpeedVac (∼1 h). The samples were stored at 4 °C until analyzed.On the day of analysis, the samples were reconstituted in 5 μl of HPLC solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, and 0.4% acetic acid). A nanoscale reverse-phase HPLC capillary column was created by packing 5-μm C18 spherical silica beads into a fused silica capillary (75-μm inner diameter × 12-cm length) with a flame-drawn tip. After equilibrating the column, each sample was pressure-loaded offline onto the column. The column was then reattached to the HPLC system. A gradient was formed, and peptides were eluted with increasing concentrations of HPLC solvent B (95% acetonitrile, 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid, and 0.4% acetic acid).As the peptides were eluted, they were subjected to electrospray ionization, at which time they entered into either an LCQ DECA ion trap mass spectrometer or an LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Eluting peptides were detected, isolated, and fragmented to produce a tandem mass spectrum of specific fragment ions for each peptide. Sites of phosphorylation were determined by matching the protein sequence with the acquired fragmentation pattern using the software program Sequest (ThermoFinnigan) by allowing for a modification comprising an additional 80 Da on Ser, Thr, or Tyr.Expression and Purification of Full-length hnRNP-C1 Tetramers—A DNA segment containing full-length hnRNP-C1 (residues 1–293) (10Williamson D.J. Banik-Maiti S. DeGregori J. Ruley H.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4094-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was amplified from a nearly full-length clone of hnRNP-C1 using the PCR. Wild-type hnRNP-C1 was mutated using the QuikChange multisite-directed mutagenesis kit to generate the S247E,S286E double mutant (2E-hnRNP-C1) as well as the S225E,S228E,S240E,S247E,S286E quintuple mutant (5E-hnRNP-C1). The amplified fragments corresponding to these three proteins were each subcloned into the NdeI and BamHI sites of pET-3b (Novagen). Automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing of the constructs verified the authenticity of the inserts.E. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) bacteria (Novagen) transformed with the hnRNP-C1 constructs were grown to A600 = 0.6 at 25 °C and then induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 18 h at 25 °C. The cells were pelleted at 3000 × g for 30 min and stored at -80 °C. The cells were thawed and suspended in 3 volumes of 10 mm Tris, 8 m urea, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the homogenates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min in a Sorvall RC-5 high speed centrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and diluted 1:10 with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Buffer B). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The diluted supernatant was centrifuged at 3000 × g for 20 min and filtered through cheesecloth. The sample was then applied to an Econo-Pac High Q anion exchange cartridge (Bio-Rad) at 2 ml/min using a BioLogic DuoFlow chromatography system. The proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1–1 m) in Buffer B. Fractions containing hnRNP-C were pooled (4 ml) and diluted 1:10 with Buffer B. The sample was then applied to an S6 cation exchange column (Bio-Rad), and hnRNP-C was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.1–1.0 m) in Buffer B. Fractions containing hnRNP-C were pooled (2 ml) and concentrated to 0.5 ml using a Centricon YM-3 centrifugal concentrating device. The concentrated sample was then applied at 0.4 ml/min to a Superdex 200 10/300 GL preparative gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT. The purified protein (1.5 ml) was dialyzed overnight against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm DTT. The concentrations of the full-length hnRNP-C proteins were determined by analysis of colloidal Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels using a GS-800 laser densitometer (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.Quantitative Fluorescence RNA Binding Studies—Fluorescent ethenoadenosine-modified poly(A) was synthesized by reacting poly(A) with chloracetaldehyde as described previously (21Kochetkov N.K. Shibaev V.N. Kost A.A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1971; 22: 1993-1996Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Equilibrium binding studies were performed at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA at a nucleotide (residue) concentration of 1 μm. As purified hnRNP-C was titrated into the binding mixture, the enhancement in ethenoadenosine-modified poly(A) fluorescence upon protein binding was monitored using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer at an excitation wavelength of 310 nm and an emission wavelength of 410 nm. The raw fluorescence readings were corrected for dilution and for the background fluorescence of the protein, assessed in the absence of ethenoadenosine-modified poly(A). Data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph and the McGhee-von Hippel model for binding large ligands to a homogeneous lattice (22McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2709) Google Scholar). According to this model, the binding of a large ligand such as a protein to a homogeneous lattice such as a segment of RNA can be described as follows: νL=K·(1−nν)·[(2ω+1)(1−nν)+ν−R2(ω−1)(1−nν)]n−1·[1−(n+1)ν+R2(1−nν)]2 (Eq. 1) where: R={[1−(n+1)ν]2+4ων(1−nν)} (Eq. 2) and where ν is the moles of bound ligand (protein)/mol of lattice residues, L is the molar free ligand concentration, n is the number of lattice residues occupied by a single ligand or the binding site size, K is the intrinsic association constant in units of m-1, and ω is the cooperativity parameter such that ω > 1 indicates positive cooperativity in ligand binding. Here, the binding site size (n) was assumed to be constant at 230 nucleotides (lattice residues), as determined previously (23McAfee J.G. Soltaninassab S.R. Lindsay M.E. LeStourgeon W.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1212-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Free ligand concentrations were calculated based on the total protein concentrations and the calculated bound protein concentrations obtained from preliminary nonlinear regression analyses.Miscellaneous Methods—H2O2 concentrations of stock solutions were determined using ϵ = 81 m-1 at 230 nm. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. Chemicals not otherwise specified were obtained from Sigma. Protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW.RESULTSPurification of an hnRNP-C Kinase from Mouse Liver—The purified recombinant hnRNP-C ACD was used as a substrate to identify hnRNP-C kinase activities in mouse liver extracts. Previously, the purified ACD was shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 at the position corresponding to Ser247, but was not phosphorylated by multiple other kinases, including protein kinase A and multiple isoforms of protein kinase C. A double mutant containing Ser-to-Glu mutations at the two basal sites of phosphorylation (S247E,S286E, ACD-2E) was utilized to identify kinases capable of phosphorylating the H2O2-stimulated sites of phosphorylation. Such an activity was identified in mouse liver extracts, and the kinase was isolated using red-agarose affinity chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, and an affinity column consisting of the GST-ACD-2E fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 1A). This kinase activity readily phosphorylated the ACD-2E protein and also the ACD-3E protein, although to a lesser extent. The ACD-3E protein contained a third mutation (S240E) at one of the H2O2-stimulated sites of phosphorylation.Tandem mass spectral analyses demonstrated that the kinase phosphorylated ACD-2E at the position corresponding to Ser240 in full-length hnRNP-C1 and phosphorylated twice the stretch of 4 contiguous Ser residues corresponding to Ser225–Ser228 (Fig. 1, B and C). The high susceptibility of this second phosphopeptide to H3PO4 loss during acquisition of collision-induced dissociation spectra (24DeGnore J.P. Qin J. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 1175-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) prevented precise localization of these two phosphates. However, the two phosphates were observed at Ser225–Ser228. Thus, hnRNP-C kinase isolated from mouse liver phosphorylates hnRNP-C at precisely the same locations as shown to be phosphorylated endogenously in endothelial cells in response to low levels of H2O2 (17Stone J.R. Maki J.L. Collins T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1301-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Protein Kinase CK1α Is an hnRNP-C Kinase—The partially purified protein kinase from mouse liver was subjected to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to identify all of the proteins present. The only protein kinase identified was murine protein kinase CK1α (Fig. 2). The kinase was identified by the presence of two tryptic peptides, YASINAHLGIEQSR and ILQGGVGIPHIR. The analysis also revealed the presence of murine centaurin-α2 (data not shown), consistent with the previous observation that CK1α co-purifies with members of the centaurin-α family of proteins (25Dubois T. Kerai P. Zemlickova E. Howell S. Jackson T.R. Venkateswarlu K. Cullen P.J. The"
https://openalex.org/W2007379437,"Meningiomas are common central nervous system tumors; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis are largely undefined. Previous work has implicated Protein 4.1B as an important tumor suppressor involved in the development of these neoplasms. In this report, we demonstrate that the U2 domain is necessary and sufficient for the ability of Protein 4.1B to function as a meningioma growth suppressor. Using a series of truncation and deletion constructs of DAL-1 (a fragment of Protein 4.1B that retains all the growth suppressive properties), we narrowed the domain required for 4.1B growth suppression to a fragment containing a portion of the FERM domain and the U2 domain using clonogenic assays on meningioma cells. Deletion of the U2 domain in the context of the full-length DAL-1 molecule eliminated growth suppressor function, as measured by thymidine incorporation and caspase-3 activation. Moreover, targeting the U2 domain to the plasma membrane using a membrane localization signal (MLS) reduced cell proliferation, similar to wild-type DAL-1. Collectively, the data suggest that the U2 domain, when properly targeted to the plasma membrane, contains all the residues necessary for mediating Protein 4.1B growth suppression."
https://openalex.org/W2085760543,"Shc proteins participate in a variety of processes regulating cell proliferation, survival and apoptosis. The two ubiquitously expressed isoforms, p52Shc/p46Shc, couple tyrosine kinase receptors to Ras by recruiting Grb2/Sos complexes to a membrane-proximal localization. Tyrosine residues 239/240 and 317 become phosphorylated following receptor engagement and, as such, form two Grb2 binding sites, which have been proposed to be differentially coupled to Myc-dependent survival and to fos-dependent proliferation, respectively. Here, we have addressed the individual function of YY239/240 and Y317 in T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. We show that p52Shc is phosphorylated on both YY239/240 and Y317 following TCR engagement. Mutation of either YY239/240 or Y317 results in impaired interaction with Grb2 and inhibition of Ras/MAP kinase activation and CD69 induction, supporting a role for both Grb2 binding sites in this function. Substitution of either YY239/240 or Y317 also results in a defective activation of Rac and the coupled stress kinases JNK and p38. Furthermore, mutation of Y317 or, to a larger extent, of YY239/240, results in increased activation-induced cell death, which in cells expressing the FF239/240 mutant is accompanied by impaired TCR-dependent c-myc transcription. The data underline a pleiotropic and nonredundant role of Shc, mediated by both YY239/240 and Y317, in T-cell activation and survival."
https://openalex.org/W2045410500,"Arsenite trioxide (As2O3) induces apoptosis in several cell lines by disturbing key signal transduction pathways through its oxidative properties. Here, we report that As2O3 also induces the phosphorylation of the retinoid receptor RXRα, subsequent to oxidative damages and the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases cascade (JNKs). We also report that RA amplifies both As2O3-induced phosphorylation of RXRα and apoptosis. Taking advantage of ‘rescue’ F9 cell lines expressing RXRα mutated at its phosphorylation sites, in an RXRα null background, we provide evidence that RXRα is a key element involved in that potentiating effect. Finally, we demonstrate that As2O3 also abrogates the transactivation of RA-target genes."

https://openalex.org/W1519911954,"The three related 160-kDa proteins, SRC-1, TIF-2 and RAC-3, were initially identified as factors interacting with nuclear receptors. They have also been reported to potentiate the activity of other transcription factors such as AP-1 or NF-kappaB. The aim of this work was to identify whether SRC-1 interferes with the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway, and if so, to identify its underlying mechanisms of action. Using transient cell transfection experiments performed in human dermal fibroblasts with the Smad3/4-specific (SBE)4-lux reporter construct, as well as the human PAI-1 promoter, we determined that SRC-1 enhances TGF-beta-induced, Smad-mediated, transcription. Likewise, SRC-1 overexpression potentiated TGF-beta-induced upregulation of PAI-1 steady-state mRNA levels. Using a mammalian two-hybrid system, we demonstrated that SRC-1 interacts with the transcriptional co-activators p300/CBP, but not with Smad3. Overexpression of the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein, an inhibitor of CBP/p300 activity, prevented the enhancing effect of SRC-1 on Smad3/4-mediated transcription, indicating that p300/CBP may be required for SRC-1 effect. Such hypothesis was validated, as expression of a mutant form of SRC-1 lacking the CBP/p300-binding site failed to upregulate Smad3/4-dependent transcription, while full-length SRC-1 potentiated p300.Smad3 interactions. These results identify SRC-1 as a novel Smad3/4 transcriptional partner, facilitating the functional link between Smad3 and p300/CBP."
https://openalex.org/W2000068416,"p21WAF1/cip1 plays a critical role in regulating intestinal cell proliferation, maturation and tumorigenesis. Our previous work demonstrated that inactivation of a single p21 allele in Apc1638+/− mice was sufficient to accelerate Apc-initiated tumor formation, and that inactivation of only one p21 allele was also sufficient to abrogate duodenal tumor inhibition by sulindac, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. To dissect the role of p21 in sulindac inhibition of intestinal tumor development in Apc1638+/− mice, we quantified p21 expression from Apc+/−, p21+/+, +/− or −/− mice fed sulindac. In Apc+/−, p21 wild-type mice fed the sulindac supplemental diet, both p21 mRNA and protein were significantly increased in the flat mucosa and tumors of the duodenum. However, p21 was not induced by sulindac in the duodenal flat mucosa and tumors of Apc+/− mice in which one or both p21 alleles had been inactivated. Further investigation revealed that the cytosine residues in a CpG cluster in the promoter region of the mouse p21 gene displayed hypermethylation in the Apc+/−, p21+/− mice. This suggested that although the p21+/− mice retained a wild-type allele, this allele was functionally modulated by hypermethylation, and that the inability of sulindac to inhibit tumor formation in Apc+/−, p21+/− mice is likely due to the inability to induce expression of the wild-type, but differentially methylated, p21 allele."

In CD45, D2 can interact with the catalytic domain (D1) and stabilize its activity. Although D2 itself has no detectable catalytic activity, it can bind substrate and may influence the substrate specificity of CD45. To further explore the function of D2 in T cells, a full-length construct of CD45 lacking the D1 catalytic domain (CD45RABC-D2) was expressed in CD45+ and CD45− Jurkat T cells. In CD45− Jurkat T cells, CD45RABC-D2 associated with Lck but, unlike its active counterpart CD45RABC, did not restore the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation or CD69 expression upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation. Expression of CD45RABC-D2 in CD45+ Jurkat T cells resulted in its association with Lck, increased the phosphorylation state of Lck, and reduced T cell activation. TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation was delayed, and although MAPK phosphorylation and CD69 expression were not significantly affected, the calcium signal and IL2 production were severely reduced. This indicates that the non-catalytic domains of CD45 can interact with Lck in T cells. CD45RABC-D2 acts as a dominant negative resulting in an increase in Lck phosphorylation and a preferential loss of the calcium signaling pathway, but not the MAPK pathway, upon TCR signaling. This finding suggests that, in addition to their established roles in the initiation of TCR signaling, CD45 and Lck may also influence the type of TCR signal generated.

CD45 is required for T cell activation by constitutively dephosphorylating the negative regulatory tyrosine of Lck, Tyr505 (reviewed in Refs. 4.Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Weiss A. Annu. Rev.

The restoration of T cell signaling by activated Lck in CD45− T cells (16.Duplay P. Alcover A. Fargeas C. Sekaly R.P. Branton P.E. J. Biol.

Dephosphorylation at Tyr505 creates a “primed” Lck molecule that can become activated upon TCR encounter with antigen, which initiates the signal transduction cascade by phosphorylating downstream substrates such as CD3ζ and ZAP-70 and leads to the activation of PLCγ-1, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) generation, an increase in intracellular calcium, CD69 expression, and IL2 production (18.Mustelin T. Tasken K. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 19.Mustelin T. Rahmouni S. Bottini N. Alonso A. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 191: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, in CD45−/- thymocytes and in some CD45− T cell lines, Lck is hyperphosphorylated at both the negative and autophosphorylation sites, suggesting that CD45 may also down-regulate Lck activity by dephosphorylating the autophosphorylation site (reviewed in Refs. 20.Ashwell J.D. D'Oro U. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar and 21.Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 406-411Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CD45 has also been implicated in down-regulating Src family kinase activity by negatively regulating integrin and CD44-mediated T cell adhesion (22.Shenoi H. Seavitt J. Zheleznyak A. Thomas M.L. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 7120-7127PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Li R.H. Wong N. Jabali M.D. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28767-28773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although Lck and, to a lesser extent, Fyn are considered major substrates for CD45 in T cells (reviewed in Refs. 24.Chan A.C. Desai D.M. Weiss A. Annu. Rev.

Although CD45-D2 has no catalytic activity, it has been implicated in regulating TCR signaling. CD45, but not a CD45-LAR-D2 chimera, decreased CD3ζ phosphorylation levels and induced ZAP-70 phosphorylation and IL2 production upon TCR stimulation, suggesting that CD45-D2 was important for directing CD3ζ dephosphorylation and ZAP-70 phosphorylation (12.Kashio N. Matsumoto W. Parker S. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33856-33863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutation of residues within the unique acidic 19 amino acid insert in CD45-D2 resulted in increased calcium levels in one T cell line and sustained calcium influx after TCR stimulation in another cell line (29.Wang Y. Liang L.Z. Esselman W.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, in another study, calcium levels and MAPK activation were reduced when cells expressing the 19 amino acid deletion mutant were stimulated via the TCR (30.Greer S.F. Wang Y. Raman C. Justement L.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7208-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CD45 can associate with Lck in T cells (31.Schraven B. Kirchgessner H. Gaber B. Samstag Y. Meuer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 2469-2477Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 32.Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M. Ross S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8958-8964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in vitro studies indicate that there is a complex interaction occurring between both the catalytic and non-catalytic regions of Lck and CD45 (33.Lefebvre D.C. Felberg J. Cross J.L. Johnson P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1650: 40-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). CD45-D2 binds to the kinase domain of Lck in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner, and the region in Lck responsible for mediating this interaction, the subdomain X region of Lck, is implicated in facilitating substrate binding and promoting dephosphorylation (10.Felberg J. Lefebvre D.C. Lam M. Wang Y. Ng D.H. Birkenhead D. Cross J.L. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3455-3462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Here, we wanted to evaluate the interaction between the noncatalytic domains of CD45 and Lck in T cells. Cell Lines and Transfectants—The human Jurkat leukemia T cell lines, clone E6.1 (CD45 positive, J+) and clone 45.01 (CD45 negative, J−), were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin-penicillin. J+ and J− cell lines were transfected by electroporation with constructs encoding full-length mouse CD45RABC, mouse CD45RABC lacking residues 649–939 (mouse CD45RABC-D2), or the pBCMGSneo vector (34.Karasuyama H. Kudo A. Melchers F. J. Exp. Med. 1990; 172: 969-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) as a control. Deletion of residues 649–939 essentially removes the catalytic D1 and PTP domain and the spacer region (7.Felberg J. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17839-17845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, CD45RABC-D2 expresses the extracellular RABC isoform, the transmembrane region, the membrane-proximal region, the inactive second PTP domain, and carboxyl tail (residues 1–648 and 940–1268). Cells were selected using 0.5–1 mg/ml active G418 (Invitrogen), and mouse CD45 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Following four rounds of sorting on the FACSVantage (BD Biosciences) for high and comparable expression of mouse CD45, two independent clones from J+ and J− cells were selected for further analysis, clones J+D2.1 and J+D2.2 and clones J−D2.1 and J−D2.2. Antibodies—The monoclonal Abs T29/33 (mouse IgG, anti-human CD45) and I3/2 (rat IgG2b, anti-mouse CD45) were gifts from I. S. Trowbridge (35.Trowbridge I.S. J. Exp. Med. 1978; 148: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). OKT3 (mouse IgG, anti-human CD3), C305 (mouse IgM, κ, anti-human TCR β subunit), and MB4B4 (rat IgG2a, anti-mouse CD45, B exon) were from ATCC. Antibodies were purified from tissue culture supernatants using protein A- or G-Sepharose 4B beads according to standard procedures. Anti-Lck (rabbit anti-Lck antisera, R54 3B) and anti-CD45 (rabbit anti-CD45 cytoplasmic domain antisera, RO2.2) were generated as previously described (36.Ng D.H.W. Jabali M.D. Maiti A. Borodchak P. Harder K. Brocker T. Malissen B. Jirik F.R. Johnson P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 867-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-p44/42 MAPK, E10 (mouse anti-human IgG1), was purchased from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). Polyclonal goat anti-rat IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Polyclonal goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with FITC or HRP was purchased from Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) and Southern Biotech (Birmingham, AL) respectively. Phycoerythrin-coupled antihuman CD69 mAb (mouse IgG1 κ) was obtained from BD Biosciences. Protein A-conjugated HRP was purchased from Bio-Rad, and antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal Ab (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Flow Cytometry—Cells (5 × 105/sample) were incubated on ice for 20 min with 100 μl of tissue culture supernatants from anti-human CD45 (T29/33), anti-mouse CD45 (I3/2), anti-CD3 (OKT3), and anti-TCR (C305), washed, and then incubated with 100 μl of 1:100 FITC goat anti-mouse Ab or FITC goat anti-rat Ab. Alternatively, cells were incubated with 10 μl of 1:1 phycoerythrin-labeled CD69. After washing, a minimum of 5000 live cells were collected on a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using CellQuest® software. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed in either 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Brij-58 with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.2 mm sodium molybdate, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin (lysis buffer). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Detergent-soluble lysates were precleared by incubation with 20 μl of Sepharose CL 4B beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Mouse CD45 was immunoprecipitated from 1 × 107 cells lysed in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer with 35 μl of I3/2-coupled Sepharose beads (4 mg/ml) or from 3 × 107 cells lysed in 1% Brij-58 lysis buffer with 100 μl of I3/2 beads for Lck co-immunoprecipitation. Lck was immunoprecipitated from 1 × 106 cells lysed in 200 μl of 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer and incubated with 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads from Repligen (Waltham, MA) precoupled with anti-Lck antiserum (R54 3B, 0.5 μl/sample). Immune complexes bound to beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were suspended in 10 μl of 3× SDS-PAGE sample-reducing buffer, boiled for 5 min, and then centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min. Samples were analyzed on 7.5–10% acrylamide gels by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Immobilon P, Millipore). Mouse CD45RABC was detected by Western blotting with tissue culture supernatants containing anti-mouse CD45RB mAb, MB4B4 (1:5), and mouse and human CD45 were detected by rabbit anti-CD45 cytoplasmic domain antisera, RO2.2 (1: 5000), and Lck was detected with rabbit R54 3B antisera (1:5000) along with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary Ab (1:5000). For analysis of the phosphorylation state of Lck, 4G10 (1:5000) was used with protein A-conjugated HRP. Blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to BioMax Film from Eastman Kodak Co. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, Lck blots were stripped and reprobed with CD45RB antibody. Measurement of Calcium Mobilization—Calcium (Ca2+) mobilization was assayed in response to TCR cross-linking as described previously (37.Justement L.B. Wienands J. Hombach J. Reth M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3272-3280PubMed Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of Buffer A (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0)) were loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye Indo-1/AM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at a concentration of 5 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. 1 ml of Buffer B (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES and 5% fetal calf serum (pH 7.4)) was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for another 30 min. The cells were washed with Buffer C (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm HEPES and 5% fetal calf serum (pH 7.2)) once and resuspended in Buffer C at a final concentration of 1 × 106/ml. Once a base line was taken, the analysis was paused, anti-TCR C305 was added to 50 μg/ml, and analysis was immediately resumed. Ionomycin (1 μm final concentration) was used as a control to confirm that cells responded equally to the influx of calcium. A FACSVantage cell sorter (BD Biosciences) was used to measure the fluorescence emissions from free and Ca2+-bound Indo-1/AM. Fluorescence emissions were separated by a 505-nm short pass beam splitter into component emissions by passage through 424- and 530-nm-centered 10-nm bandpass filters to detect violet and blue, respectively. Ratios of the emissions were calculated and plotted against time. IL2 Secretion—Cells (1 × 105) in 200 μl of RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum were stimulated in flat bottom 96-well tissue culture plates with C305 (5–50 μg/ml) plus phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (10 ng/ml, Sigma). IL2 secretion was determined after 12 h by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (BD Biosciences) performed in duplicate or triplicate. Cell Activation—For analysis of tyrosine and MAPK phosphorylation, 1–2 × 106 cells (in 20-μl volume) were stimulated with C305 (10 μg/sample) from 0 to 60 min at 37 °C. Unstimulated control samples were treated with C305 and lysed immediately. At various time points, reactions were placed on ice and 6 μl of 5× 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer added. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was mixed with 3× SDS-PAGE reducing sample buffer, boiled, and centrifuged briefly. 2 × 105 cell equivalents were analyzed on 10% acrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF. The membranes were incubated with either anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, 1:5000) or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (E10, 1:1000), washed, and then incubated with goat anti-mouse-conjugated HRP (1:5000) and visualized using ECL. For analysis of CD69 expression after TCR stimulation, cells (5 × 105/sample) were suspended in 20 μl of media and stimulated with C305 (10 μg/sample) at 37 °C for 30 min or left untreated. Up to 1 ml of fresh media was added into each sample, and cells were incubated at 37 °C from 0 to 8 h. Cells were incubated with anti-human CD69-coupled phycoerythrin and analyzed by flow cytometry. Expression of CD45RABC-D2 in CD45− Jurkat T Cells Does Not Restore TCR Signaling Events—To determine whether CD45-D2 has functions that are independent of the catalytic domain, a construct expressing full-length mouse CD45RABC lacking the catalytic D1 domain (amino acids 649–939) was transfected into CD45− (J45.01) Jurkat T cells (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). Stable transfectants were sorted for high expression of mouse CD45 and, if required, also sorted to ensure comparable levels of TCR/CD3 expression among the untransfected cells, vector alone control, and the CD45RABC-D2 transfected cells. CD45RABC-D2-transfected cells were then cloned, and at least two clones were chosen for subsequent analysis (J−D2.1 and J−D2.2) (Fig. 1, A and B). Full-length CD45RABC was also transfected into CD45− Jurkat T cells. The levels of expression of mouse CD45, TCR, and CD3 were checked routinely by FACS analysis to ensure comparable levels of expression (Fig. 1A). In addition, the presence of human CD45 was monitored by FACS analysis as low levels of human CD45 had previously been reported in the J45.01 cells (38.Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and were observed in this case (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B demonstrates the expression of CD45RABC-D2 and CD45RABC in J− cells after immunoprecipitation of mouse CD45, separation on SDS-PAGE, transfer to PVDF membrane, and then immunoblotting with an anti-mouse CD45RB-specific antibody. In the CD45− Jurkat cells, Lck is hyperphosphorylated at the negative regulatory site and TCR stimulation does not occur (reviewed in Refs. 1.Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 339-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Trowbridge I.S. Thomas M.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 85-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, and 4.Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). Transfection of the full-length CD45RABC, but not CD45RABC-D2, restored the initial induction of tyrosine phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation (Fig. 1C). CD45RABC also restored the induction of expression of CD69 monitored from 2 to 8 h, whereas the expression of CD45RABC-D2 had no effect on CD69 expression, even when stimulation was prolonged to 24 h (data not shown). This is consistent with CD45RABC-D2 lacking protein tyrosine phosphatase activity. CD45RABC-D2 Associates with Lck in CD45− and CD45+ Jurkat T Cells and Results in Increased Lck Phosphorylation in the CD45+ Jurkat T Cells—Mouse CD45RABC-D2 was transfected into CD45+ (JE6.1) Jurkat T cells (J+), and cells were sorted for high levels of expression of CD45RABC-D2 and approximately equivalent levels of expression of human CD45, TCR, and CD3 compared with the levels of the parental line (J+). Flow cytometry indicates the expression of these molecules (Fig. 2A). Specific expression of transfected mouse CD45RABC-D2 was also confirmed by blotting for anti-mouse CD45RB in J+ cell lysates (Fig. 2B, upper panel). Cell lysates were also blotted with anti-CD45 cytoplasmic domain antisera that recognize both mouse and human CD45. 2J. Felberg and P. Johnson, unpublished data. This result shows the presence of endogenous human CD45 in J+ cells and J+ cells transfected with vector alone (J+V) and both human and transfected mouse CD45RABC-D2 in J+D2.1 and D2.2 cells (Fig. 2B, lower panel). The antisera detect primarily two CD45 isoforms in J+ and J+V cells that correspond to the lower molecular mass isoforms of CD45 (39.McKenney D.W. Onodera H. Gorman L. Mimura T. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24949-24954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Coincidentally, the transfected CD45RABC-D2 lacking D1 but expressing all three alternatively spliced exons (ABC) migrated to a similar position as the lower molecular mass isoform of endogenous CD45. Mouse CD45 was immunoprecipitated from 1% Brij-58 detergent-soluble lysates of CD45+ and CD45− cells, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then immunoblotted for Lck. Fig. 3, A and B, shows that Lck co-immunoprecipitated with CD45RABC and CD45RABC-D2 in both the CD45+ and CD45− T cells. This demonstrates that CD45RABC-D2 can associate with Lck in the absence of endogenous CD45. It also suggests that the interaction occurs independently of Lck phosphorylation, because Lck is hyperphosphorylated in CD45− but not in the CD45+ cells (Fig. 3C). In addition, this shows that the association can occur in the absence of the active PTP domain, CD45-D1. Lck was immunoprecipitated from 1% Triton-X-100-soluble lysates and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The tyrosine phosphorylation state of Lck was analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, 4G10. Fig. 3C shows increased Lck phosphorylation in the Jurkat cells expressing CD45RABC-D2. A comparison of Lck phosphorylation in untransfected CD45+ and CD45− with that in CD45RABC-D2-transfected cells revealed that the phosphorylation was always greater than the level observed in the CD45+ cells but less than that observed in the CD45− Jurkat cells. In addition, the level of Lck phosphorylation was affected by the amount of CD45RABC-D2 expressed. At lower expression levels, less Lck was phosphorylated (data not shown). This finding suggests that the presence of CD45RABC-D2 is preventing normal Lck dephosphorylation in CD45+ Jurkat T cells. CD45RABC-D2 Does Not Affect MAPK Activation or CD69 Expression—To determine whether the presence of CD45RABC-D2 affected TCR signaling and T cell activation, the cells were stimulated with soluble TCR antibody. Cells expressing CD45RABC-D2 showed a slower induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 4A). Maximum phosphorylation was observed in the parental CD45+ cells after 1 min, whereas comparable phosphorylation was not observed in the CD45RABC-D2-transfected cells until 5 min. To determine whether this change translated to any changes in downstream effects, MAPK (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and CD69 expression levels were monitored. Fig. 4B showed that, whereas MAPK phosphorylation was absent in the CD45− T cells and induced at 5 min in the CD45+ T cells, the presence of CD45RABC-D2 did not significantly affect the induction time or intensity of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Because CD69 expression is downstream of MAPK activation (40.Testi R. D'Ambrosio D. De Maria R. Santoni A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we examined the induction of CD69 expression after TCR stimulation. Fig. 4C showed that the basal level of CD69 was slightly decreased in CD45RBAC-D2-expressing cells. There was also a slight delay of CD69 induction observed at 1 h, but by 2 h, CD69 induction was comparable. This observation suggests that the slight delay in the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation is insufficient to cause significant differences downstream in the MAPK pathway leading to CD69 expression. CD45RABC-D2 Prevents Calcium Flux and IL2 Production—To determine whether CD45RABC-D2 affected the other major signaling pathway in TCR signaling, the calcium pathway, cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye, Indo-1/AM. Changes in intracellular calcium levels were monitored on the FACSVantage, and after a base line had been established, TCR antibody was added to the cells. Fig. 5A (upper panel) indicated that, although the CD45+ cells had a robust increase in intracellular calcium, cells expressing CD45RABC-D2 had virtually no calcium response. Their response was similar to Jurkat cells expressing no CD45 (J−). The addition of ionomycin (Fig. 5A, lower panel) led to similar increases in intracellular calcium, indicating that all of the cells were capable of responding to calcium. TCR signaling pathways in Jurkat T cells converge to stimulate IL2 gene transcription. To determine the outcome of TCR signaling in the CD45RABC-D2-transfected CD45+ T cells, cells were stimulated with TCR antibody together with PMA. The amount of IL2 secreted after 12 h of stimulation was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fig. 5B indicated that the expression of CD45RABC-D2 dramatically reduced IL2 production in CD45+ Jurkat cells. A similar effect was also seen when the CD3 antibody, OKT3, and PMA were used for stimulation (data not shown). IL2 was not produced in the absence of CD45 or by PMA alone. CD45RABC-D2-transfected cells did not secrete significant levels of IL2, even after 48 h of stimulation (data not shown). This study indicates that a CD45 protein lacking the catalytic domain of CD45 can associate with Lck in T cells, independently of the phosphorylation state of Lck. Although the precise region of CD45 mediating this interaction was not determined, in vitro data indicate that the second PTP domain of CD45, D2, can bind directly to Lck in a phosphotyrosine-independent manner (10.Felberg J. Lefebvre D.C. Lam M. Wang Y. Ng D.H. Birkenhead D. Cross J.L. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3455-3462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, data from this study show that expression of CD45RABC-D2 results in an increase in Lck phosphorylation in CD45+ T cells, suggesting that, in the absence of an active D1, CD45RABC-D2 binds to Lck and prevents its dephosphorylation by endogenous CD45. This is also consistent with in vitro data showing a role for D2 in binding substrate and facilitating substrate dephosphorylation (10.Felberg J. Lefebvre D.C. Lam M. Wang Y. Ng D.H. Birkenhead D. Cross J.L. Johnson P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3455-3462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In addition, when CD45 D2 was replaced with LAR-D2 and the chimera was expressed in T cells, there was no decrease in CD3ζ phosphorylation, leading Kashio et al. (12.Kashio N. Matsumoto W. Parker S. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33856-33863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to conclude that CD45-D2 has a role in binding substrate. The data presented here are consistent with this conclusion as we show that CD45RABC-D2 binds to the major CD45 substrate in T cells, Lck. However, it is also possible that other regions of CD45 may facilitate an indirect interaction with Lck. For example, the extracellular domain of CD45, primarily CD45R0, has been reported to associate with CD4, which in turn binds Lck (41.Dornan S. Sebestyen Z. Gamble J. Nagy P. Bodnar A. Alldridge L. Doe S. Holmes N. Goff L.K. Beverley P. Szollosi J. Alexander D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1912-1918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 42.Leitenberg D. Novak T.J. Farber D. Smith B.R. Bottomly K. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Although the transmembrane region of CD45 is not required for its association with Lck, it does mediate an interaction with CD45AP (43.Kitamura K. Maiti A. Ng D.H.W. Johnson P. Maizel A.L. Takeda A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21151-21157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), which also binds to Lck (44.Veillette A. Soussou D. Latour S. Davidson D. Gervais F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14392-14399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although CD45RABC-D2 can associate with Lck in the absence of CD45, CD45RABC-D2 may also bind to CD45 because a small amount co-immunoprecipitated with endogenous CD45 (data not shown). This may also contribute to the reduced effectiveness of CD45, as it has been suggested that the membraneproximal region of one CD45 molecule may bind the catalytic domain of another and down-regulate its function (45.Desai D.M. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Cell. 1993; 73: 541-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 46.Majeti R. Xu Z. Parslow T.G. Olson J.L. Daikh D.I. Killeen N. Weiss A. Cell. 2000; 103: 1059-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In Jurkat T cells, CD45 is required for the following TCR signaling events: the induction of tyrosine phosphorylation; PLCγ-1 activation; production of IP3, and increase in intracellular calcium levels (38.Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 47.Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142PubMed Google Scholar). This positive effect on TCR signaling has been attributed to the ability of CD45 to dephosphorylate the negative regulatory tyrosine, Tyr505, in Lck, which generates a primed Lck that can be activated when the TCR recognizes antigen (reviewed in Refs. 4.Hermiston M.L. Xu Z. Weiss A. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar, 15.Johnson P. Felberg J. Mod. Asp. Immunobiol. 2000; 1: 156-159Google Scholar, and 18.Mustelin T. Tasken K. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this study, CD45RABC-D2 disrupted the ability of endogenous CD45 to efficiently dephosphorylate Lck and resulted in aberrant TCR signaling. It caused a slight delay in the induction of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, but did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation of MAPK or the induction of CD69 expression. However, it did have a dramatic effect on calcium flux and IL2 production. In other studies, deletion or mutation of the unique acidic region in CD45-D2 generated defects in calcium signaling and, in one case, MAPK activation in T cells (29.Wang Y. Liang L.Z. Esselman W.J. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 2557-2564Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30.Greer S.F. Wang Y. Raman C. Justement L.B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7208-7218Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and when CD45-D2 was replaced with LAR-D2, TCR-induced IL2 production was reduced (12.Kashio N. Matsumoto W. Parker S. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33856-33863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together, these data point toward a role for the noncatalytic D2 domain in regulating TCR signaling. Jurkat T cells and its associated T cell signaling mutants have been invaluable in identifying the components of the TCR signaling pathway (48.Abraham R.T. Weiss A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). However, one caveat to the use of the Jurkat T cell line is that it is defective in the expression of two lipid phosphatases, SHIP and PTEN, that results in the constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. However, how this impacts TCR signaling events in this and other studies is not clear as the importance of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase in TCR signaling is still poorly understood. TCR signaling activates at least two major signaling pathways leading to IL2 production, the Ras-MAPK pathway and the calcium pathway, and CD45 and Lck were thought to be required for both pathways. Indeed, CD45 is required for the activation and induction of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ-1 (38.Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 47.Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142PubMed Google Scholar), which generates diacylglycerol and IP3, and then IP3 triggers the release of calcium from intracellular stores (reviewed in Ref. 49.Lewis R.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 497-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). In addition, TCR-induced phosphorylation of MAPK was dependent on Src family kinase activation as PP2, a Src family kinase inhibitor, abolished its phosphorylation (data not shown). Here, we show that CD45RABC-D2 severely reduces the calcium signal but not the MAPK pathway, suggesting that the calcium pathway may have a higher threshold for activation than the MAPK pathway and thus may be more sensitive to changes in Lck activity. Alternatively, the activation of the MAPK pathway can occur through at least two mechanisms: 1) via PLCγ-1, diacylglycerol production, and Ras-GRP activation (50.Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 2) by SOS, a Ras-GEF (guanine nucleotide exchange factor) that binds to Grb2, which is recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT upon TCR stimulation (reviewed in Refs. 51.Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and 52.Cantrell D.A. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 122-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), and thus possibly be less affected by reduced Lck activity. Another possibility is that CD45RABCD2 may exert its effect independently of Lck. Exactly how CD45RABC-D2 is affecting the calcium pathway is not clear. If PLCγ-1 activity were reduced in CD45RABC-D2 expressing cells, one would predict a reduction in the Ras-GRP pathway leading to MAPK activation as well as a reduction in calcium signaling. However, there was no significant effect on ERK phosphorylation, even though this pathway is known to be activated upon TCR stimulation in Jurkat T cells (50.Ebinu J.O. Stang S.L. Teixeira C. Bottorff D.A. Hooton J. Blumberg P.M. Barry M. Bleakley R.C. Ostergaard H.L. Stone J.C. Blood. 2000; 95: 3199-3203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53.Yablonski D. Kuhne M.R. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the expression of CD45RABC-D2 only slightly delayed the TCR-induced phosphorylation of PLCγ-1 (data not shown). This result suggests that the defect in the calcium signal may be downstream of PLCγ-1. The precise target affected by CD45RABC-D2 remains to be identified, but candidates are the IP3 receptor, which is tyrosinephosphorylated by the Src family kinase, Fyn, or T cell calcium channels, the regulation of which is poorly understood. Finally, the expression of CD45RABC-D2 dramatically affected the production of IL2 in response to TCR stimulation. This was via a major effect on the calcium pathway, not the Ras-MAPK pathway. Interestingly, defective calcium signals, but not MAPK signaling, upon TCR recognition are associated with the induction of adaptive tolerance in T cells (54.Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 305-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar). This study suggests that this type of signaling would occur upon TCR recognition if CD45 was prevented from effectively dephosphorylating Lck or if Lck phosphorylation became deregulated.

https://openalex.org/W2002180169,"Cisplatin is the most commonly used chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer. One of the mechanisms of resistance of ovarian tumours to cisplatin is increased nucleotide excision repair activity, in particular increased levels of the endonuclease ERCC1. Since 30–40% of ovarian cancers develop resistance to cisplatin after treatment and these tumours are usually incurable, ERCC1 expression is potentially useful as a predictive marker for the effectiveness of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Using RT–PCR and Northern blotting, we have examined the expression of a 42 bp differentially spliced sequence in exon 1 of the human ERCC1 gene, loss of which has previously been reported to be correlated with higher levels of ERCC1 mRNA in ovarian cancer cell lines. We report here that this alternate transcript is ubiquitous in human tissues and cancer cell lines, is absent in mouse and thus does not appear to be cancer related."
https://openalex.org/W2098542409,"Hypoxia, a common feature of solid tumors, is a direct stress that triggers apoptosis in many cell types. Poor or irregular tumor vascularization also leads to a decreased drug diffusion and cancer cells distant from blood vessels (hypoxic cells) are exposed to low drug concentrations. In this report, we show that low daunomycin concentrations protect HCT116 colorectal cancer cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. While hypoxia induced p53 accumulation without expression of its responsive genes (bax and p21), daunomycin treatment restored p53 transactivation activity and cell cycle progression. We also demonstrated a role for Akt activation in daunomycin-induced protection through phosphorylation and inactivation of the Bcl-2 family proapoptotic factor Bad. Our data therefore suggest that chemotherapy could possibly, because of low concentrations in poorly vascularized tumors, protect cancer cells from hypoxia-induced cytotoxicity."
