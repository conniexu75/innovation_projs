https://openalex.org/W3132367506,"Current X-ray imaging technologies involving flat-panel detectors have difficulty in imaging three-dimensional objects because fabrication of large-area, flexible, silicon-based photodetectors on highly curved surfaces remains a challenge1–3. Here we demonstrate ultralong-lived X-ray trapping for flat-panel-free, high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging using a series of solution-processable, lanthanide-doped nanoscintillators. Corroborated by quantum mechanical simulations of defect formation and electronic structures, our experimental characterizations reveal that slow hopping of trapped electrons due to radiation-triggered anionic migration in host lattices can induce more than 30 days of persistent radioluminescence. We further demonstrate X-ray luminescence extension imaging with resolution greater than 20 line pairs per millimetre and optical memory longer than 15 days. These findings provide insight into mechanisms underlying X-ray energy conversion through enduring electron trapping and offer a paradigm to motivate future research in wearable X-ray detectors for patient-centred radiography and mammography, imaging-guided therapeutics, high-energy physics and deep learning in radiology. Using lanthanide-doped nanomaterials and flexible substrates, an approach that enables flat-panel-free, high-resolution, three-dimensional imaging is demonstrated and termed X-ray luminescence extension imaging."
https://openalex.org/W3133455371,"Plastics are key components of almost any technology today. Although their production consumes substantial feedstock resources, plastics are largely disposed of after their service life. In terms of a circular economy1–8, reuse of post-consumer sorted polymers (‘mechanical recycling’) is hampered by deterioration of materials performance9,10. Chemical recycling1,11 via depolymerization to monomer offers an alternative that retains high-performance properties. The linear hydrocarbon chains of polyethylene12 enable crystalline packing and provide excellent materials properties13. Their inert nature hinders chemical recycling, however, necessitating temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius and recovering ethylene with a yield of less than 10 per cent3,11,14. Here we show that renewable polycarbonates and polyesters with a low density of in-chain functional groups as break points in a polyethylene chain can be recycled chemically by solvolysis with a recovery rate of more than 96 per cent. At the same time, the break points do not disturb the crystalline polyethylene structure, and the desirable materials properties (like those of high-density polyethylene) are fully retained upon recycling. Processing can be performed by common injection moulding and the materials are well-suited for additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing. Selective removal from model polymer waste streams is possible. In our approach, the initial polymers result from polycondensation of long-chain building blocks, derived by state-of-the-art catalytic schemes from common plant oil feedstocks, or microalgae oils15. This allows closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials. Polycarbonates and polyesters with materials properties like those of high-density polyethylene can be recycled chemically by depolymerization to their constituent monomers, re-polymerization yielding material with uncompromised processing and materials properties."
https://openalex.org/W3130861457,"Temporal genomic data hold great potential for studying evolutionary processes such as speciation. However, sampling across speciation events would, in many cases, require genomic time series that stretch well back into the Early Pleistocene subepoch. Although theoretical models suggest that DNA should survive on this timescale1, the oldest genomic data recovered so far are from a horse specimen dated to 780-560 thousand years ago2. Here we report the recovery of genome-wide data from three mammoth specimens dating to the Early and Middle Pleistocene subepochs, two of which are more than one million years old. We find that two distinct mammoth lineages were present in eastern Siberia during the Early Pleistocene. One of these lineages gave rise to the woolly mammoth and the other represents a previously unrecognized lineage that was ancestral to the first mammoths to colonize North America. Our analyses reveal that the Columbian mammoth of North America traces its ancestry to a Middle Pleistocene hybridization between these two lineages, with roughly equal admixture proportions. Finally, we show that the majority of protein-coding changes associated with cold adaptation in woolly mammoths were already present one million years ago. These findings highlight the potential of deep-time palaeogenomics to expand our understanding of speciation and long-term adaptive evolution."
https://openalex.org/W3132847906,"The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for safeguarding genome integrity. When a DSB forms, the PI3K-related ATM kinase rapidly triggers the establishment of megabase-sized, chromatin domains decorated with phosphorylated histone H2AX (γH2AX), which act as seeds for the formation of DNA-damage response foci1. It is unclear how these foci are rapidly assembled to establish a 'repair-prone' environment within the nucleus. Topologically associating domains are a key feature of 3D genome organization that compartmentalize transcription and replication, but little is known about their contribution to DNA repair processes2,3. Here we show that topologically associating domains are functional units of the DNA damage response, and are instrumental for the correct establishment of γH2AX-53BP1 chromatin domains in a manner that involves one-sided cohesin-mediated loop extrusion on both sides of the DSB. We propose a model in which H2AX-containing nucleosomes are rapidly phosphorylated as they actively pass by DSB-anchored cohesin. Our work highlights the importance of chromosome conformation in the maintenance of genome integrity and demonstrates the establishment of a chromatin modification by loop extrusion."

https://openalex.org/W3131597949,"Obesity increases the risk of mortality because of metabolic sequelae such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease1. Thermogenesis by adipocytes can counteract obesity and metabolic diseases2,3. In thermogenic fat, creatine liberates a molar excess of mitochondrial ADP-purportedly via a phosphorylation cycle4-to drive thermogenic respiration. However, the proteins that control this futile creatine cycle are unknown. Here we show that creatine kinase B (CKB) is indispensable for thermogenesis resulting from the futile creatine cycle, during which it traffics to mitochondria using an internal mitochondrial targeting sequence. CKB is powerfully induced by thermogenic stimuli in both mouse and human adipocytes. Adipocyte-selective inactivation of Ckb in mice diminishes thermogenic capacity, increases predisposition to obesity, and disrupts glucose homeostasis. CKB is therefore a key effector of the futile creatine cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3131676233,"Crystallization by particle attachment (CPA) is a frequently occurring mechanism of colloidal crystallization that results in hierarchical morphologies1,2,3,4. CPA has been exploited to create nanomaterials with unusual properties4,5,6 and is implicated in the development of complex mineral textures1,7. Oriented attachment7,8—a form of CPA in which particles align along specific crystallographic directions—produces mesocrystals that diffract as single crystals do, although the constituent particles are still discernible2,9. The conventional view of CPA is that nucleation provides a supply of particles that aggregate via Brownian motion biased by attractive interparticle potentials1,9,10,11,12. However, mesocrystals often exhibit regular morphologies and uniform sizes. Although many crystal systems form mesocrystals1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 and individual attachment events have been directly visualized10, how random attachment events lead to well defined, self-similar morphologies remains unknown, as does the role of surface-bound ligands, which are ubiquitous in nanoparticle systems3,9,11. Attempts to understand mesocrystal formation are further complicated in many systems by the presence of precursor nanoparticles with a phase distinct from that of the bulk1,13,14. Some studies propose that such particles convert before attachment15, whereas others attribute conversion to the attachment process itself16 and yet others conclude that transformation occurs after the mesocrystals exceed a characteristic size14,17. Here we investigate mesocrystal formation by iron oxides, which are important colloidal phases in natural environments18,19 and classic examples of systems forming ubiquitous precursor phases and undergoing CPA accompanied by phase transformations15,19,20,21. Combining in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at 80 degrees Celsius with ‘freeze-and-look’ TEM, we tracked the formation of haematite (Hm) mesocrystals in the presence of oxalate (Ox), which is abundant in soils, where iron oxides are common. We find that isolated Hm particles rarely appear, but once formed, interfacial gradients at the Ox-covered surfaces drive Hm particles to nucleate repeatedly about two nanometres from the surfaces, to which they then attach, thereby generating mesocrystals. Comparison to natural and synthetic systems suggests that interface-driven pathways are widespread."
https://openalex.org/W3129342397,"Citrate is best known as an intermediate in the tricarboxylic acid cycle of the cell. In addition to this essential role in energy metabolism, the tricarboxylate anion also acts as both a precursor and a regulator of fatty acid synthesis1-3. Thus, the rate of fatty acid synthesis correlates directly with the cytosolic concentration of citrate4,5. Liver cells import citrate through the sodium-dependent citrate transporter NaCT (encoded by SLC13A5) and, as a consequence, this protein is a potential target for anti-obesity drugs. Here, to understand the structural basis of its inhibition mechanism, we determined cryo-electron microscopy structures of human NaCT in complexes with citrate or a small-molecule inhibitor. These structures reveal how the inhibitor-which binds to the same site as citrate-arrests the transport cycle of NaCT. The NaCT-inhibitor structure also explains why the compound selectively inhibits NaCT over two homologous human dicarboxylate transporters, and suggests ways to further improve the affinity and selectivity. Finally, the NaCT structures provide a framework for understanding how various mutations abolish the transport activity of NaCT in the brain and thereby cause epilepsy associated with mutations in SLC13A5 in newborns (which is known as SLC13A5-epilepsy)6-8."
https://openalex.org/W3131300525,"Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and its precise control is vital to maintain normal brain function and to prevent excitotoxicity1. The removal of extracellular glutamate is achieved by plasma-membrane-bound transporters, which couple glutamate transport to sodium, potassium and pH gradients using an elevator mechanism2–5. Glutamate transporters also conduct chloride ions by means of a channel-like process that is thermodynamically uncoupled from transport6–8. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable these dual-function transporters to carry out two seemingly contradictory roles are unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a glutamate transporter homologue in an open-channel state, which reveals an aqueous cavity that is formed during the glutamate transport cycle. The functional properties of this cavity, combined with molecular dynamics simulations, reveal it to be an aqueous-accessible chloride permeation pathway that is gated by two hydrophobic regions and is conserved across mammalian and archaeal glutamate transporters. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism by which glutamate transporters support their dual function, and add information that will assist in mapping the complete transport cycle shared by the solute carrier 1A transporter family. Glutamate transporters conduct chloride ions through an aqueous channel with hydrophobic gates that forms during the glutamate transport cycle."
https://openalex.org/W3033077667,"The explosion of disinformation accompanying the COVID-19 pandemic has overloaded fact-checkers and media worldwide, and brought a new major challenge to government responses worldwide. Not only is disinformation creating confusion about medical science amongst citizens, but it is also amplifying distrust in policy makers and governments. To help tackle this, we developed computational methods to categorise COVID-19 disinformation. The COVID-19 disinformation categories could be used for a) focusing fact-checking efforts on the most damaging kinds of COVID-19 disinformation; b) guiding policy makers who are trying to deliver effective public health messages and counter effectively COVID-19 disinformation. This paper presents: 1) a corpus containing what is currently the largest available set of manually annotated COVID-19 disinformation categories; 2) a classification-aware neural topic model (CANTM) designed for COVID-19 disinformation category classification and topic discovery; 3) an extensive analysis of COVID-19 disinformation categories with respect to time, volume, false type, media type and origin source."
https://openalex.org/W3131777139,"Coherent control of quantum dynamics is key to a multitude of fundamental studies and applications1. In the visible or longer-wavelength domains, near-resonant light fields have become the primary tool with which to control electron dynamics2. Recently, coherent control in the extreme-ultraviolet range was demonstrated3, with a few-attosecond temporal resolution of the phase control. At hard-X-ray energies (above 5-10 kiloelectronvolts), Mössbauer nuclei feature narrow nuclear resonances due to their recoilless absorption and emission of light, and spectroscopy of these resonances is widely used to study the magnetic, structural and dynamical properties of matter4,5. It has been shown that the power and scope of Mössbauer spectroscopy can be greatly improved using various control techniques6-16. However, coherent control of atomic nuclei using suitably shaped near-resonant X-ray fields remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate such control, and use the tunable phase between two X-ray pulses to switch the nuclear exciton dynamics between coherent enhanced excitation and coherent enhanced emission. We present a method of shaping single pulses delivered by state-of-the-art X-ray facilities into tunable double pulses, and demonstrate a temporal stability of the phase control on the few-zeptosecond timescale. Our results unlock coherent optical control for nuclei, and pave the way for nuclear Ramsey spectroscopy17 and spin-echo-like techniques, which should not only advance nuclear quantum optics18, but also help to realize X-ray clocks and frequency standards19. In the long term, we envision time-resolved studies of nuclear out-of-equilibrium dynamics, which is a long-standing challenge in Mössbauer science20."

Microplastic densities, surveyed on six Oahu beaches, were highest on the beaches with the coarsest sands, associated with high wave energy. On those beaches, densities were very high (700–1700 particles m -2 ), as high as those recorded on other remote island beaches worldwide. Densities were higher at storm tide lines than high tide lines. Results from our study provide empirical data on the distribution of microplastics on the most populated and visited of the Hawaiian islands."
https://openalex.org/W3129329093,"Emotion plays a significant role in interpersonal communication and also improving social life. In recent years, facial emotion recognition is highly adopted in developing human-computer interfaces (HCI) and humanoid robots. In this work, a triangulation method for extracting a novel set of geometric features is proposed to classify six emotional expressions (sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, and happiness) using computer-generated markers. The subject’s face is recognized by using Haar-like features. A mathematical model has been applied to positions of eight virtual markers in a defined location on the subject’s face in an automated way. Five triangles are formed by manipulating eight markers’ positions as an edge of each triangle. Later, these eight markers are uninterruptedly tracked by Lucas- Kanade optical flow algorithm while subjects’ articulating facial expressions. The movement of the markers during facial expression directly changes the property of each triangle. The area of the triangle (AoT), Inscribed circle circumference (ICC), and the Inscribed circle area of a triangle (ICAT) are extracted as features to classify the facial emotions. These features are used to distinguish six different facial emotions using various types of machine learning algorithms. The inscribed circle area of the triangle (ICAT) feature gives a maximum mean classification rate of 98.17% using a Random Forest (RF) classifier compared to other features and classifiers in distinguishing emotional expressions."
https://openalex.org/W3129928570,"Ursodeoxycholic acid (commercially available as ursodiol) is a naturally occurring bile acid that is used to treat a variety of hepatic and gastrointestinal diseases. Ursodiol can modulate bile acid pools, which have the potential to alter the gut microbiota community structure. In turn, the gut microbial community can modulate bile acid pools, thus highlighting the interconnectedness of the gut microbiota-bile acid-host axis. Despite these interactions, it remains unclear if and how exogenously administered ursodiol shapes the gut microbial community structure and bile acid pool in conventional mice. This study aims to characterize how ursodiol alters the gastrointestinal ecosystem in conventional mice. C57BL/6J wildtype mice were given one of three doses of ursodiol (50, 150, or 450 mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 21 days. Alterations in the gut microbiota and bile acids were examined including stool, ileal, and cecal content. Bile acids were also measured in serum. Significant weight loss was seen in mice treated with the low and high dose of ursodiol. Alterations in the microbial community structure and bile acid pool were seen in ileal and cecal content compared to pretreatment, and longitudinally in feces following the 21-day ursodiol treatment. In both ileal and cecal content, members of the Lachnospiraceae Family significantly contributed to the changes observed. This study is the first to provide a comprehensive view of how exogenously administered ursodiol shapes the healthy gastrointestinal ecosystem in conventional mice. Further studies to investigate how these changes in turn modify the host physiologic response are important."
https://openalex.org/W3129369166,"Objective To describe maternal and neonatal glycaemic control following antenatal corticosteroid administration to women with diabetes in pregnancy. Design Retrospective cohort study Setting A tertiary hospital in Auckland, New Zealand Population Women with diabetes in pregnancy who received antenatal corticosteroids from 2006–2016. Methods Corticosteroid administration, maternal and neonatal glycaemia data were retrieved from electronic patient records. Demographic data were downloaded from the hospital database. Relationships between variables were analysed using multivariate analysis. Main outcome measures Maternal hyperglycaemia and neonatal hypoglycaemia Results Corticosteroids were administered to 647 of 7317 of women with diabetes (8.8%) who gave birth to 715 babies. After an initial course of corticosteroids, 92% and 52% of women had blood glucose concentrations &gt; 7 and &gt; 10 mmol/L respectively. Median peak blood glucose concentration of approximately 10 mmol/L occurred 9 hours after corticosteroid administration and hyperglycaemia lasted approximately 72 hours. Thirty percent of women gave birth within 72 hours of the last dose of corticosteroids. Babies of women who were hyperglycaemic within 24 hours of birth were more likely to develop hypoglycaemia (&lt; 2.6 mmol/L, OR 1.51 [95% CI 1.10–2.07], p = 0.01) and severe hypoglycaemia (≤ 2.0 mmol/L, OR 2.00 [95% CI 1.41–2.85], p &lt; 0.0001) than babies of non-hyperglycaemic mothers. There was no association between maternal glycaemia within 7 days of the last dose of corticosteroids and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Conclusions Hyperglycaemia is common in women with diabetes in pregnancy following antenatal corticosteroid administration. Maternal hyperglycaemia in the 24 hours prior to birth is associated with increased risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Limitations included the retrospective study design, so that not all data were available for all women and babies and the glucose testing schedule was variable."
https://openalex.org/W3130527283,"To determine the expression profile and clinical significance of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with primary gout and healthy control subjects. Human lncRNA microarrays were used to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs in primary gout patients (n = 6) and healthy control subjects (n = 6). Bioinformatics analyses were performed to predict the roles of differently expressed lncRNAs and mRNAs. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect the expression levels of 8 lnRNAs in 64 primary gout patients and 32 healthy control subjects. Spearman’s correlation was used to analyze the correlation between these eight lncRNAs and the laboratory values of gout patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the lncRNAs identified in gout. The microarray analysis identified 1479 differentially expressed lncRNAs (879 more highly expressed and 600 more lowly expressed), 862 differentially expressed mRNAs (390 more highly expressed and 472 more lowly expressed) in primary gout (fold change &gt; 2, P &lt; 0.05), respectively. The bioinformatic analysis indicated that the differentially expressed lncRNAs regulated the abnormally expressed mRNAs, which were involved in the pathogenesis of gout through several different pathways. The expression levels of TCONS_00004393 and ENST00000566457 were significantly increased in the acute gout flare group than those in the intercritical gout group or healthy subjects (P&lt;0.01). Moreover, inflammation indicators were positive correlated with TCONS_00004393 and ENST00000566457 expression levels. The areas under the ROC curve of ENST00000566457 and NR-026756 were 0.868 and 0.948, respectively. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanisms of primary gout, and reveal that TCONS_00004393 and ENST00000566457 might be as candidate targets for the treatment of gout flare; ENST00000566457 and NR-026756 could effectively discriminate between the gout and the healthy control groups."

This study assessed the relationship between internet addiction and sleep quality among adolescents in a peri-urban setting in Nepal. Method This cross-sectional study employed a questionnaire survey among 390 adolescent students recruited from two schools in Kirtipur Municipality in Nepal. The Internet Addiction Test and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess internet addiction and poor sleep quality respectively. The association between internet addiction and sleep quality was analysed by logistic regression. Results One-fifth (21.5%) of the participants were identified with borderline internet addiction and 13.3% with possible internet addiction. Poor sleep quality was found among 31% of the participants. Internet addiction was significantly associated with poor sleep quality (OR = 1.85, p = 0.022 for borderline, and OR = 3.98, p = &lt;0.001 for possible internet addiction compared to no internet addiction). Conclusion Adolescents with internet addiction were more vulnerable to suffer from poor sleep quality. It is recommended that municipalities and schools should aware the adolescent students on the adverse effects of excessive internet use including poor sleep quality. The findings have implications for adolescents, parents, school authorities and researchers."
https://openalex.org/W3131499157,"The study of the muscles of the tongue forms part of a basic evaluation of upper airway function that includes swallowing, speaking and chewing. It is important because the upper airway presents a region of collapse during sleep. Through the action of the dilator muscles, mainly the genioglossus, such collapse can be prevented. In this study, we present a simple tool that can be used to measure the strength of the tongue. This tool may provide an easy way to measure tongue function and allow a simple evaluation of pathologies that affect the tone of the tongue. We have carried out 20 tongue strength measurements using the Tongue Digital Spoon (TDS) in a healthy adult population, using the Iowa Oral Performance Instrument (IOPI) as the gold standard. To validate the procedure, we performed replicate measurements on 20 individuals aged 20–70 years. We found a mean TDS measurement of 115.99 g/cm 2 in young subjects, 98.47 g/cm 2 in middle-aged subjects and 84.23 g/cm 2 in the elderly. There was a significant difference in the measurements between young and elderly participants. There was also a significant correlation between TDS and IOPI measurements (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.69, P &lt; 0.001). We found the TDS to be a useful tool in daily clinical practice for the measurement of the strength of the tongue in the healthy population. It has potential application in oropharyngeal monitoring and rehabilitation."

https://openalex.org/W3133268543,"Background Non-arteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is the most common acute optic neuropathy over the age of 50 years. NAION is commonly associated with systemic vascular risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia) and small cup-to-disc-ratio. We have assessed the prevalence risk factors of NAION and the visual outcome in patients referred to a tertiary ophthalmology center in Kuwait. Materials and methods A retrospective review of new cases of NAION presenting within 2 weeks of onset were included and baseline clinical and demographics characteristic were determined. The prevalence of risk factors and the visual outcome (change in logMAR visual acuity, mean deviation of visual field) was compared between young NAION patients (below 50 years of age) and older NAION patients (over 50 years of age). The odds ratio of a final favorable visual outcome (visual acuity 20/40 or better) by age category was determined. Results Seventy-eight eyes of 78 patients with recent onset NAION were included in the study. The most prevalent risk factors for NAION in our subjects were diabetes (64.1%), small cup-to-disc ratio (61.5%), hyperlipidemia (51.3%) and hypertension (38.5%). Young NAION patients had better final logMAR visual acuity (0.55 +- 0.57) then older NAION patients (0.9 +- 0.73), (p = 0.03). Furthermore, young NAION patients were 2.8 times more likely to have a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better than older NAION patients, odds ratio (OR), 2.87; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12–7.40, Chi-square p-value = 0.03). Conclusion There is a high prevalence of systemic vascular risk factors and small cup-to-disc ratio in NAION patients referred to our center across different age groups (below and above 50 years). Patients below the age of 50 years with NAION are more likely to have a final visual acuity of 20/40 or better than NAION patients above the age of 50 years."
https://openalex.org/W3133353990,"Existing dynamic graph embedding-based outlier detection methods mainly focus on the evolution of graphs and ignore the similarities among them. To overcome this limitation for the effective detection of abnormal climatic events from meteorological time series, we proposed a dynamic graph embedding model based on graph proximity, called DynGPE. Climatic events are represented as a graph where each vertex indicates meteorological data and each edge indicates a spurious relationship between two meteorological time series that are not causally related. The graph proximity is described as the distance between two graphs. DynGPE can cluster similar climatic events in the embedding space. Abnormal climatic events are distant from most of the other events and can be detected using outlier detection methods. We conducted experiments by applying three outlier detection methods (i.e., isolation forest, local outlier factor, and box plot) to real meteorological data. The results showed that DynGPE achieves better results than the baseline by 44.3% on average in terms of the F-measure. Isolation forest provides the best performance and stability. It achieved higher results than the local outlier factor and box plot methods, namely, by 15.4% and 78.9% on average, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W3133454926,"Background Childhood and adolescent drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) is one of the neglected infectious diseases. Limited evidence exists around programmatic outcomes of children and adolescents receiving DR-TB treatment. The study aimed to determine the final treatment outcomes, culture conversion rates and factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome in children and adolescents with DR-TB. Methods This is a descriptive study including children (0–9 years) and adolescents (10–19 years) with DR-TB were who were initiated on ambulatory based treatment between January 2017-June 2018 in Shatabdi hospital, Mumbai, India where National TB elimination programme(NTEP) Mumbai collaborates with chest physicians and Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) in providing comprehensive care to DR-TB patients. The patients with available end-of-treatment outcomes were included. The data was censored on February 2020. Result A total of 268 patients were included; 16 (6%) of them were children (0–9 years). The median(min-max) age was 17(4–19) years and 192 (72%) were females. Majority (199, 74%) had pulmonary TB. Most (58%) had MDR-TB while 42% had fluoroquinolone-resistant TB. The median(IQR) duration of treatment (n = 239) was 24(10–25) months. Median(IQR) time for culture-conversion (n = 128) was 3(3–4) months. Of 268 patients, 166(62%) had successful end-of-treatment outcomes (cured-112; completed treatment-54). Children below 10 years had higher proportion of successful treatment outcomes (94% versus 60%) compared to adolescents. Patients with undernutrition [adjusted odds-ratio, aOR (95% Confidence Interval, 95%CI): 2.5 (1.3–4.8) or those with XDR-TB [aOR (95% CI): 4.3 (1.3–13.8)] had higher likelihood of having unsuccessful DR-TB treatment outcome. Conclusion High proportion of successful treatment outcome was reported, better than global reports. Further, the nutritional support and routine treatment follow up should be strengthened. All oral short and long regimens including systematic use of new TB drugs (Bedaquiline and Delamanid) should be rapidly scaled up in routine TB programme, especially for the paediatric and adolescent population."
https://openalex.org/W3018835178,"Traffic networks have been proved to be fractal systems. However, previous studies mainly focused on monofractal networks, while complex systems are of multifractal structure. This paper is devoted to exploring the general regularities of multifractal scaling processes in the street network of 12 Chinese cities. The city clustering algorithm is employed to identify urban boundaries for defining comparable study areas; box-counting method and the direct determination method are utilized to extract spatial data; the least squares calculation is employed to estimate the global and local multifractal parameters. The results showed multifractal structure of urban street networks. The global multifractal dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped curves, while the local singularity spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves. If the moment order q approaches negative infinity, the generalized correlation dimension will seriously exceed the embedding space dimension 2, and the local fractal dimension curve displays an abnormal decrease for most cities. The scaling relation of local fractal dimension gradually breaks if the q value is too high, but the different levels of the network always keep the scaling reflecting singularity exponent. The main conclusions are as follows. First, urban street networks follow multifractal scaling law, and scaling precedes local fractal structure. Second, the patterns of traffic networks take on characteristics of spatial concentration, but they also show the implied trend of spatial deconcentration. Third, the development space of central area and network intensive areas is limited, while the fringe zone and network sparse areas show the phenomenon of disordered evolution. This work may be revealing for understanding and further research on complex spatial networks by using multifractal theory."
https://openalex.org/W3131229629,"We aimed to develop a metformin dosing strategy to optimise efficacy and safety in patients with reduced kidney function. Metformin data from two studies stratified by kidney function were analysed. The relationship between metformin clearance and kidney function estimates was explored using a regression analysis. The maintenance dose range was predicted at different bands of kidney function to achieve an efficacy target of 1 mg/L for steady-state plasma concentrations. The dosing strategy was evaluated using simulations from a published metformin pharmacokinetic model to determine the probability of concentrations exceeding those associated with lactic acidosis risk, i.e. a steady-state average concentration of 3 mg/L and a maximum (peak) concentration of 5 mg/L. A strong relationship between metformin clearance and estimated kidney function using the Cockcroft and Gault (r 2 = 0.699), MDRD (r 2 = 0.717) and CKD-Epi (r 2 = 0.735) equations was found. The probability of exceeding the safety targets for plasma metformin concentration was &lt;5% for most doses and kidney function levels. The lower dose of 500 mg daily was required to maintain concentrations below the safety limits for patients with an eGFR of 15–29 mL/min. Our analysis suggests that a maximum daily dose of 2250, 1700, 1250, 1000, and 500 in patients with normal kidney function, CKD stage 2, 3a, 3b and 4, respectively, will provide a reasonable probability of achieving efficacy and safety.

We undertook this study to compare detailed demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics of IgG4-related RPF and IRPF in a large Chinese cohort. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 132 RPF patients diagnosed at Peking University People’s Hospital between March 2010 and March 2018. Among the 132 patients, the mean age at disease onset was 54.8 years. IgG4-related RPF group showed greater male predominance compared to IRPF group. IgG4-related RPF patients showed a longer interval between symptom onset and diagnosis, and allergic diseases were more common in this group. Sixty-four patients (48.4%) had lower back pain, which was more common in IRPF group than that in IgG4-related RPF patients. In terms of organ involvement, although 42 of 47 patients (89.3%) with IgG4-related RPF had other organ involvement, there were no patients in the IRPF group with other organ involvement. In addition, the serum IgG4 level, elevated eosinophils counts and IgE level were significantly higher in IgG4-related RPF patients. We described the demographic, clinical and laboratory differences between IgG4-related RPF and IRPF patients, indicating their potential differences in pathogenesis, which was of great importance to diagnose and manage the two phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3132138502,"The purpose of this study was to explore the speaker-discriminatory potential of vowel formant mean frequencies in comparisons of identical twin pairs and non-genetically related speakers. The influences of lexical stress and the vowels’ acoustic distances on the discriminatory patterns of formant frequencies were also assessed. Acoustic extraction and analysis of the first four speech formants F1-F4 were carried out using spontaneous speech materials. The recordings comprise telephone conversations between identical twin pairs while being directly recorded through high-quality microphones. The subjects were 20 male adult speakers of Brazilian Portuguese (BP), aged between 19 and 35. As for comparisons, stressed and unstressed oral vowels of BP were segmented and transcribed manually in the Praat software. F1-F4 formant estimates were automatically extracted from the middle points of each labeled vowel. Formant values were represented in both Hertz and Bark. Comparisons within identical twin pairs using the Bark scale were performed to verify whether the measured differences would be potentially significant when following a psychoacoustic criterion. The results revealed consistent patterns regarding the comparison of low-frequency and high-frequency formants in twin pairs and non-genetically related speakers, with high-frequency formants displaying a greater speaker-discriminatory power compared to low-frequency formants. Among all formants, F4 seemed to display the highest discriminatory potential within identical twin pairs, followed by F3. As for non-genetically related speakers, both F3 and F4 displayed a similar high discriminatory potential. Regarding vowel quality, the central vowel /a/ was found to be the most speaker-discriminatory segment, followed by front vowels. Moreover, stressed vowels displayed a higher inter-speaker discrimination than unstressed vowels in both groups; however, the combination of stressed and unstressed vowels was found even more explanatory in terms of the observed differences. Although identical twins displayed a higher phonetic similarity, they were not found phonetically identical."

Their content levels vary depending on the species, and they also change in response to any external stimuli. Thus, simultaneous quantification of multiple plant hormones is required to understand plant physiology. Sensitive and quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography-linked mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been used in detecting plant hormones; however, quantification without stable isotopes is yet to be established. In this study, we quantified seven representative plant hormones of Lotus japonicus , which is a model legume for standard addition method. Accurate masses for monoisotopic ions of seven phytohormones were determined for high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS). Selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode based on accurate masses was used in detecting phytohormones in the roots, stems, and leaves. Evaluation of matrix effects showed ion suppression ranging from 10.2% to 87.3%. Both stable isotope dilution and standard addition methods were able to detect plant hormones in the roots, stems, and leaves, with no significant differences in using both approaches and thus a standard addition method can be used to quantify phytohormones in L . japonicus . The method will be effective, especially when stable isotopes are not available to correct for matrix effects."
https://openalex.org/W3130122527,"While research on the nexus of migration and wellbeing of individuals has gained recognition in recent years, far less attention has been devoted to intra-urban mobility especially among the urban poor young populations. We assess the drivers of intra-urban mobility using a random sample of 412 migrant street children and youth in Kampala city, Uganda. This paper draws from a larger cross-sectional survey of circular migration and sexual and reproductive health choices among street children in Kampala, Uganda. We define ‘migrants’ as street children and youth with a rural-urban migration experience and ‘intra-urban mobility’ as the number of places stayed in or moved since migrating to the city, measured on a continuous scale. More than half (54.37%) of the migrant street children and youth had lived in two or more places since migrating to the city. Multivariate negative binomial regression analysis reveals migrant street children and youth’s intra-urban mobility to be associated with gender (aIRR = 0.71, 95%CI 0.53–0.96), sex work (aIRR = 1.38, 95%CI 1.01–1.88), a daily income of one USD or more (aIRR = 1.57, 95%CI 1.16–2.13) and duration of stay in the city (aIRR = 1.54, 95%CI 1.17–2.01). Other drivers of intra-urban mobility included availability of causal work, personal safety and affordability of rental costs. Our findings suggest the need for urban housing and health policies to take into account street children and youth’s intra-urban mobility and its drivers. Future research on all drivers of street children and youth’s intra-urban mobility and its linkage with their health outcomes is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3132571957,"Purpose A rapid increase of recreational nitrous oxide use (i.e. laughing gas, N 2 O) has been reported in several countries, while it has received limited attention in scientific research. We aimed to study the association of socio-demographic characteristics, mental well-being, sickness absence, truancy, and substance use with the frequency of lifetime nitrous oxide use among adolescents. Methods We used self-reported questionnaire data of adolescents (N = 555) attending secondary schools to cross-sectionally assess the frequency of nitrous oxide use and potential factors associated with nitrous oxide use, such as gender, mental well-being, and binge drinking. Ordinal logistic regression models were applied with lifetime nitrous oxide use (never, once, ≥ two times) as the outcome variable. Results Adolescents were on average 15.6 years old (SD = 0.83, range 14–18), 47.0% were female. In total, 86 (15.6%) adolescents had used nitrous oxide at least once in their life. In the multivariable ordinal regression model, the risk of having a higher category of lifetime nitrous oxide use was associated with a non-Dutch ethnic background (OR = 2.10, 95% CI 1.22; 3.61), attending pre-vocational education (OR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.06; 3.34), a higher score on the scale of externalizing problems (OR = 1.10, 95% CI 1.01; 1.20), binge drinking twice or more in the past four weeks (OR = 2.49, 95% CI 1.25; 4.94), and cannabis use (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.03; 3.79). Conclusions Youth Health Care professionals should be aware of nitrous oxide use in adolescents, especially among adolescents with a non-Dutch ethnic background, lower education levels, externalizing problems, frequent binge drinking, and cannabis use."
https://openalex.org/W3132582925,"Introduction In recent times, there has been an increasing burden in traumatic, medical, and surgical emergency conditions, placing more emphasis on the need for quality emergency care. This study aimed to explore the challenges experienced by nurses working in the emergency unit of a secondary referral hospital. Methods The study used an exploratory qualitative research design with a constructivist approach and a grounded theory method. Data were collected through in-depth interviews lasting between 30 to 45 minutes using a semi-structured interview guide. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse data. Results Eleven (11) participants were interviewed. The majority were female (9), aged between 31–40 years. From the inductive content analysis, four themes emerged. These were; 1) overcrowding in the emergency unit, 2) understaffing at the emergency unit, 3) lack of emergency equipment, 4) inadequate managerial support. Conclusion The study identified several major challenges confronting nurses working in the emergency unit which are linked with managerial processes and inadequate managerial support. These challenges need to be addressed to promote quality emergency nursing care. To foster a positive working environment, hospital management should validate and address the aforementioned concerns of the Emergency Department nurses."

Therefore, a thematic analysis of literature has been conducted by examining various good quality research works on intrinsic characteristics eliciting pro-environmental actions. Based upon the thematic analysis, a new scale of measure has been proposed with the help of 17 scholars and 15 practitioners hailing from different countries by mutually agreed intended meanings and breadth of the theoretical concepts. The new scale has 4 dimensions comprising a pool of 32 items, which has been empirically validated through the data collected from 268 Malaysian tourists. The dimensions are: sense of obligation to care for the natural environment, sense of obligation to practice eco-friendly activities, sense of obligation to purchase eco-friendly products, and sense of obligation to support eco-friendly inventions. The theoretical and managerial implications together with research limitations have been discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3133313792,"Background This randomized study compared the efficacy and safety of extraplexus and intraplexus injection of local anesthetic for interscalene brachial plexus block. Methods 208 ASA I-II patients scheduled for elective shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia and ultrasound-guided interscalene brachial plexus block were randomly allocated to receive an injection of 25mL ropivacaine 0.5% either between C5-C6 nerve roots (intraplexus), or anterior and posterior to the brachial plexus into the plane between the perineural sheath and scalene muscles (extraplexus). The primary outcome was time to loss of shoulder abduction. Secondary outcomes included block duration, perioperative opioid consumption, pain scores, block performance time, number of needle passes, onset of sensory blockade, paresthesia, recovery room length of stay, patient satisfaction, incidence of Horner’s syndrome, dyspnea, hoarseness, and post-operative nausea and vomiting. Results Time to loss of shoulder abduction was faster in the intraplexus group (log-rank p-value&lt;0.0005; median [interquartile range]: 4 min [2–6] vs. 6 min [4–10]; p-value &lt;0.0005). Although the intraplexus group required fewer needle passes (2 vs. 3, p&lt;0.0005), it resulted in more transient paresthesia (35.9% vs. 14.5%, p = 0.0004) with no difference in any other secondary outcome. Conclusion The intraplexus approach to the interscalene brachial plexus block results in a faster onset of motor block, as well as sensory block. Both intraplexus and extraplexus approaches to interscalene brachial plexus block provide effective analgesia. Given the increased incidence of paresthesia with an intraplexus approach, an extraplexus approach to interscalene brachial plexus block is likely a more appropriate choice."
https://openalex.org/W3129671004,"Strategies to return to dental practice in pandemic times is a new challenge due to the generation and spread of potentially contaminated dispersion particles (PCDP) that may contain the SARS-CoV-2, the etiological factor of the COVID-19 disease. Due to the significant dispersion of PCDP in the dental environment, the use of equipment such as ultrasonic tips have been inadvisable during the pandemic. Several clinical procedures, however, benefit from the use of such equipment. Thus, using a microbial dispersion model of PCDP, the aim of this study was to compare the dispersion caused by the dental drill (DD) an ultrasonic tip (UT) alone and the UT coupled with a Spray control (SC) device. The DD, UT (with or without the SC) were activated for one minute having had the water from the reservoir replaced with a suspension of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (1.5 x 10 8 CFU/mL). Petri dishes containing MRS agar were positioned at 50cm, 100cm and 150cm from the headrest of the dental chair at different angles (0 degree and 90 degrees). At 50 cm, the mean CFU (standard deviation) of L . casei Shirota was 13554.60 (4071.03) for the DD, 286.67 (73.99) for the US (97.89% reduction), and 4.5 (0.58) CFU for the UT-SC (p &lt; 0.0001), establishing a further 98.43% reduction between UT and UT with SC. The UT with SC model proved effective in reducing dispersion from the UT, endorsing its use as an additional strategy to reduce PCDP in the dental environment in times of pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3130484305,"Objective To investigate the behavioral characteristics of semantic dementia (SD) using an instrument originally developed for patients with autism spectrum disorder. Methods The behavioral symptoms of 20 patients with SD and 20 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in both the preclinical state and the dementia state were evaluated using the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Autism Society Japan Rating Scale (PARS). Results The SD group showed high prevalence in four behaviors related to stereotypy and social impairment: eating very few food items, selfishness, difficulty in recognizing others’ feeling and thoughts, and interpreting language literally. Scores on the PARS short version, which is sensitive for diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, were significantly higher in the dementia state than in the preclinical state in both the SD (11.5 ± 6.0 and 1.7 ± 2.5, respectively; t (19) = 6.7, p &lt; 0.001) and AD (6.9 ± 4.6 and 1.7 ± 2.0, respectively; t (19) = 5.1, p &lt; 0.001) groups. PARS short version scores after dementia onset increased in both the SD and AD groups, although the increase was significantly larger in the SD group (F = 5.6, p = 0.023). Additionally, a significantly higher rate of patients exceeded the cutoff score for autism diagnosis in the dementia state in the SD group (75%) than in the AD group (40%; χ 2 = 5.0, p = 0.025). PARS scores in the dementia state were significantly correlated with illness duration (r = 0.46, p = 0.04) and Mini-Mental State Examination scores (r = −0.75, p &lt; 0.001) in the SD group only. Conclusions Although SD and autism spectrum disorder are etiologically distinct diseases, patients with semantic dementia behave like those with autism spectrum disorder. Our findings suggest the symptomatic similarity of the two disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3131591901,"Objectives Intimate partner violence (IPV) against women is frequent in Central Africa and may be a HIV infection risk factor. More data on HIV-positive men (MLHIV) committing IPV are needed to develop perpetrator-focused IPV and HIV prevention interventions. We investigated the relationship between IPV and HIV transmission risk and IPV-associated factors. Methods We used data from the cross-sectional survey EVOLCam which was conducted in Cameroonian outpatient HIV structures in 2014. The study population comprised MLHIV declaring at least one sexual partner in the previous year. Using principal component analysis, we built three variables measuring, respectively, self-reported MLHIV-perpetrated psychological and physical IPV (PPV), severe physical IPV (SPV), and sexual IPV (SV). Ordinal logistic regressions helped investigate: i) the relationship between HIV transmission risk (defined as unstable aviremia and inconsistent condom use) and IPV variables, ii) factors associated with each IPV variable. Results PPV, SPV and SV were self-reported by 28, 15 and 11% of the 406 study participants, respectively. IPV perpetrators had a significantly higher risk of transmitting HIV than non-IPV perpetrators. Factors independently associated with IPV variables were: i) socio-demographic, economic and dyadic factors, including younger age (PPV and SPV), lower income (PPV), not being the household head (SPV and SV), living with a main partner (SPV), and having a younger main partner (SPV); ii) sexual behaviors, including ≥2 partners in the previous year (PPV and SPV), lifetime sex with another man (SPV), inconsistent condom use (SV), and &gt;20 partners during lifetime (SV); iii) HIV-related stigma (PPV and SV). Conclusion IPV perpetrators had a higher risk of transmitting HIV and having lifetime and recent risky sexual behaviors. Perpetrating IPV was more frequent in those with socioeconomic vulnerability and self-perceived HIV-related stigma. These findings highlight the need for interventions to prevent IPV by MLHIV and related HIV transmission to their(s) partner(s)."
https://openalex.org/W3131643735,"Protein sumoylation, especially when catalyzed by the Mms21 SUMO E3 ligase, plays a major role in suppressing duplication-mediated gross chromosomal rearrangements (dGCRs). How Mms21 targets its substrates in the cell is insufficiently understood. Here, we demonstrate that Esc2, a protein with SUMO-like domains (SLDs), recruits the Ubc9 SUMO conjugating enzyme to specifically facilitate Mms21-dependent sumoylation and suppress dGCRs. The D430R mutation in Esc2 impairs its binding to Ubc9 and causes a synergistic growth defect and accumulation of dGCRs with mutations that delete the Siz1 and Siz2 E3 ligases. By contrast, esc2-D430R does not appreciably affect sensitivity to DNA damage or the dGCRs caused by the catalytically inactive mms21-CH . Moreover, proteome-wide analysis of intracellular sumoylation demonstrates that esc2-D430R specifically down-regulates sumoylation levels of Mms21-preferred targets, including the nucleolar proteins, components of the SMC complexes and the MCM complex that acts as the catalytic core of the replicative DNA helicase. These effects closely resemble those caused by mms21-CH , and are relatively unaffected by deleting Siz1 and Siz2. Thus, by recruiting Ubc9, Esc2 facilitates Mms21-dependent sumoylation to suppress the accumulation of dGCRs independent of Siz1 and Siz2."
https://openalex.org/W3133355147,"Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infection in infants and young children worldwide. The attachment (G) protein of RSV is synthesized by infected cells in both a membrane bound (mG) and secreted form (sG) and uses a CX3C motif for binding to its cellular receptor. Cell culture and mouse studies suggest that the G protein mimics the cytokine CX3CL1 by binding to CX3CR1 on immune cells, which is thought to cause increased pulmonary inflammation in vivo . However, because these studies have used RSV lacking its G protein gene or blockade of the G protein with a G protein specific monoclonal antibody, the observed reduction in inflammation may be due to reduced virus replication and spread, and not to a direct role for G protein as a viral chemokine. In order to more directly determine the influence of the soluble and the membrane-bound forms of G protein on the immune system independent of its attachment function for the virion, we expressed the G protein in cotton rat lungs using adeno-associated virus (AAV), a vector system which does not itself induce inflammation. We found no increase in pulmonary inflammation as determined by histology and bronchoalveolar lavage after inoculation of AAVs expressing the membrane bound G protein, the secreted G protein or the complete G protein gene which expresses both forms. The long-term low-level expression of AAV-G did, however, result in the induction of non-neutralizing antibodies, CD8 T cells and partial protection from challenge with RSV. Complete protection was accomplished through co-immunization with AAV-G and an AAV expressing cotton rat interferon α."

https://openalex.org/W3130289246,"Study objectives Brain regulation of autonomic function in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is disrupted in a sex-specific manner, including in the insula, which may contribute to several comorbidities. The insular gyri have anatomically distinct functions with respect to autonomic nervous system regulation; yet, OSA exerts little effect on the organization of insular gyral responses to sympathetic components of an autonomic challenge, the Valsalva. We further assessed neural responses of insular gyri in people with OSA to a static handgrip task, which principally involves parasympathetic withdrawal. Methods We measured insular function with blood oxygen level dependent functional MRI. We studied 48 newly-diagnosed OSA (age mean±std:46.5±9 years; AHI±std:32.6±21.1 events/hour; 36 male) and 63 healthy (47.2±8.8 years;40 male) participants. Subjects performed four 16s handgrips (1 min intervals, 80% subjective maximum strength) during scanning. fMRI time trends from five insular gyri—anterior short (ASG); mid short (MSG); posterior short (PSG); anterior long (ALG); and posterior long (PLG)—were assessed for within-group responses and between-group differences with repeated measures ANOVA ( p &lt;0.05) in combined and separate female-male models; age and resting heart-rate (HR) influences were also assessed. Results Females showed greater right anterior dominance at the ASG, but no differences emerged between OSA and controls in relation to functional organization of the insula in response to handgrip. Males showed greater left anterior dominance at the ASG, but there were also no differences between OSA and controls. The males showed a group difference between OSA and controls only in the ALG. OSA males had lower left activation at the ALG compared to control males. Responses were mostly influenced by HR and age; however, age did not impact the response for right anterior dominance in females. Conclusions Insular gyri functional responses to handgrip differ in OSA vs controls in a sex-based manner, but only in laterality of one gyrus, suggesting anterior and right-side insular dominance during sympathetic activation but parasympathetic withdrawal is largely intact, despite morphologic injury to the overall structure."
https://openalex.org/W3130422588,"Background To estimate the impact of stunting on the development of effective verbal communication (EVC) in children aged 24 to 36 months. Methods We conducted a retrospective, quasi-experimental study design using data from 4452 children between 24 and 36 months of age available in the Early Childhood Development (ECD) section of the Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) 2019 survey. Achievement of EVC was considered as the dependent variable. After propensity score matching analysis, a total 601 children were included in the exposed (children with stunting) and 3848 in the unexposed group (children without stunting). The psmatch2 Stata software command was used to estimate the impact of stunting on EVC with a level of 5% for significance. Results The EVC indicator was achieved by 57.4% of the children between 24 and 36 months of age evaluated, while the prevalence of stunting in this population was 14%. The evaluation of impact showed that the group exposed to stunting was 8% less likely to show EVC compared to the unexposed group (ATT -0.08; 95% CI -0.106 to -0.054; p&lt;0.001). Conclusions The presence of stunting was found to have a significant impact on the propensity to show EVC in Peruvian children between 24 and 36 months of age. Strengthening of strategies for reducing malnutrition in vulnerable areas, as well as those directly affecting EVC is a priority for diminishing gaps in the achievement of this indicator in our country."
https://openalex.org/W3131457912,"Subclinical human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) replication is associated with immune dysfunction in immuno-suppressed antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive HIV infected individuals. No data is documented in Ethiopia so far concerning HCMV co-infection among HIV infected individuals. Hence, this study was aimed at generating data regarding the prevalence of active HCMV infection among treatment-naive HIV-infected individuals from Ethiopia. For this purpose, we enrolled 97 treatment-naive HIV infected study subjects in Addis Ababa from June to December 2018. ELISA and conventional PCR were performed consecutively to detect HCMV specific IgM antibody and HCMV DNA respectively. Of the 97 study subjects, 12 (12.4%) were positive for anti-CMV IgM antibodies but were not confirmed by PCR. With regard to the PCR positivity, 4/97 (4.1%) samples were positive for HCMV DNA. No statically significant associations were found between the dependent and independent variables. The presence of HCMV DNA in the current study highlights the need for a routine laboratory diagnosis for preventing HCMV disease among HIV-infected individuals early. Besides, the use of anti-CMV therapy for these CMV viremic individuals is also recommended as this can reduce the burden of CMV complications and consecutively prolonging the life of HIV infected individuals."
https://openalex.org/W3131602962,"Various serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli have been epidemiologically associated with foodborne disease episodes in the United States and around the globe, with E . coli O157: H7 as the dominant serogroup of public health concern. Serogroups other than O157 are currently associated with about 60% of Shiga toxin-producing E . coli related foodborne illness episodes. Current study evaluated sensitivity of the O157 and epidemiologically important non-O157 serogroups of the pathogen to elevated hydrostatic pressure and 1% lactic acid. Pressure intensity of 250 to 650 MPa were applied for 0 to 7 min for inactivation of strain mixtures of wild-type and rifampicin-resistant E . coli O157, as well as O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145 serogroups and ATCC ® 43895 ™ strain in ground meat and 10% meat homogenate. E . coli O157 were reduced ( p &lt; 0.05) from 6.86 ± 0.2 to 4.56 ± 0.1 log CFU/g when exposed to pressure of 650 MPa for 7 min. Corresponding reductions ( p &lt; 0.05) for non-O157 E . coli were from 6.98 ± 0.3 to 4.72 ± 0.1. The D- values at 650 MPa were 3.71 and 3.47 min for O157 and non-O157 serogroups, respectively. Presence of 1% lactic acid to a great extent augmented ( p &lt; 0.05) decontamination efficacy of the treatment in meat homogenate resulting in up to 5.6 and 6.0 log CFU/mL reductions for O157 and non-O157 serogroups, respectively. Among the tested serogroups, the wild-type and rifampicin-resistant phenotypes exhibited ( p ≥ 0.05) comparable pressure sensitivity. Thus, these two phenotypes could be used interchangeably in validation studies. Our results also illustrate that, application of elevated hydrostatic pressure could be utilized for assuring safety of ground and non-intact meat products against various serogroups of Shiga toxin-producing E . coli . Addition of 1% lactic acid additionally provided industrially appreciable augmentation in efficacy of the pressure-based treatments."
https://openalex.org/W3132241184,"To reduce the burden of early-life linear growth faltering in low- and middle-income countries, interventions have focused on nutrition strategies, sometimes combined with water quality, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). However, even when combined, their effects on linear growth have been inconsistent. Here, we investigate potential predictors of length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) in a cohort of resource-poor rural Indonesian infants to inform the optimal strategies to reduce linear growth faltering. Apparently healthy rural breastfed Indonesian infants were randomly selected from birth registries at age 6 months (n = 230) and followed up at 9 (n = 202) and 12 (n = 190) months. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we examined longitudinal relationships among socio-demographic status, maternal height, infant sex, age, water source, sanitation facility, energy, protein, micronutrient intakes and biomarkers (serum ferritin, zinc, retinol binding protein (RBP), selenium–adjusted for inflammation), and α-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (systemic inflammation biomarkers) at age 6 and 9 months on LAZ at age 9 and 12 months. Stunting (LAZ &lt;-2) at 6, 9, and 12 months was 15.7%, 19.3%, and 22.6%, respectively. In the full model, the predictor variable at age 6 months that was most strongly associated with infant LAZ at 9 months was maternal height (0.18 (95% CI 0.03, 0.32) SD). At age 9 months, the strongest predictors of LAZ at 12 months were improved drinking water source (-0.40 (95% CI -0.65, -0.14) vs. not improved), elevated AGP compared to not elevated (0.26 (95%CI -0.06, 0.58), maternal height (0.16 (95% CI 0.02, 0.31) SD), sex (0.22 (95% CI -0.02,0.45) female vs. male), serum RBP (0.12 (95% CI -0.01, 0.25) SD), and protein intake (0.17 (95% CI -0.01, 0.35) SD).

https://openalex.org/W3132247060,"Solitary drinking is a risk marker for alcohol use disorder; thus, it is important to identify why individuals drink alone and for whom this association is particularly relevant. Evidence suggests the desire to ameliorate negative affect (NA) motivates solitary drinking, with some individuals particularly likely to drink alone to cope, but all past studies are cross-sectional. The present study therefore aimed to determine whether 1) experimentally induced NA increased preferences to drink alcohol alone, and 2) whether the relationship between NA and choosing to drink alcohol alone was moderated by neuroticism, drinking to cope motives, and social anxiety. Current drinkers (ages 21-29) with a solitary drinking history (N=126) were randomly assigned to either NA, positive affect [PA], or no affect change (control) conditions via differing cognitive task feedback. After the mood manipulation, participants chose between drinking alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages in one of two contexts: alone or socially. Evidence regarding effectiveness of the mood manipulation was mixed, and few chose non-alcoholic beverages in either context. Condition did not influence outcome choice. Across conditions, increases in NA and the importance placed on receiving one’s context choice were associated with solitary (versus social) alcohol preference. Neuroticism and its interaction with NA change also influenced choice; individuals high in neuroticism chose more solitary (versus social) drinking contexts while the opposite was true for those low in neuroticism, and among the latter, the preference difference was more pronounced with relatively smaller NA increases. Findings are discussed based on the existing solitary drinking literature."
https://openalex.org/W3133286679,"In tropical rainforests, access to and availability of natural resources are vital for the dietary diversity and food security of forest-dwelling societies. In the Congo Basin, these are challenged by the increasing exploitation of forests for bushmeat, commercial hardwood, mining, and large-scale agriculture. In this context, a balanced approach is needed between the pressures from forest exploitation, non-timber forest product trade and the livelihood and dietary behavior of rural communities. While there is a general positive association between tree cover and dietary diversity, the complex biocultural interactions between tropical forest food resources and the communities they sustain are still understudied. This research focuses on the knowledge and use of wild food plants by the forest-dwelling Baka people in southeast Cameroon. By using two different sets of methods, namely ex-situ interviews and in-situ surveys, we collected ethnographic and ethnobotanical data in two Baka settlements and explored the diversity of wild edible plants known, the frequency of their consumption, and potential conflicts between local diet and commercial trade in forest resources. Within a single Baka population, we showed that the in-situ walk-in-the-woods method resulted in more detailed information on wild food plant knowledge and use frequency than the ex-situ methods of freelisting and dietary recalls. Our in-situ method yielded 91 wild edible species, much more than the ex-situ freelisting interviews (38 spp.) and dietary recalls (12 spp.). Our results suggest that studies that are based only on ex-situ interviews may underestimate the importance of wild food plants for local communities. We discuss the limitations and strengths of these different methods for investigating the diversity of wild food plant knowledge and uses. Our analysis shows that future studies on wild food plants would profit from a mixed approach that combines in-situ and ex-situ methods."
https://openalex.org/W3133445053,"Fractal dimensions and characteristic periodicities were evaluated in normal sentences, computer-generated word salads, and word salads from schizophrenia patients, in both Japanese and English, using the random walk patterns of vowels. In normal sentences, the walking curves were smooth with gentle undulations, whereas computer-generated word salads were rugged with mechanical repetitions, and word salads from patients with schizophrenia were unreasonably winding with meaningless repetitive patterns or even artistic cohesion. These tendencies were similar in both languages. Fractal dimensions between normal sentences and word salads of schizophrenia were significantly different in Japanese [1.19 ± 0.09 (n = 90) and 1.15 ± 0.08 (n = 45), respectively] and English [1.20 ± 0.08 (n = 91), and 1.16 ± 0.08 (n = 42)] (p &lt; 0.05 for both). Differences in long-range (&gt;10) periodicities between normal sentences and word salads from schizophrenia patients were predominantly observed at 25.6 (p &lt; 0.01) in Japanese and 10.7 (p &lt; 0.01) in English. The differences in fractal dimension and characteristic periodicities of relatively long-range (&gt;10) presented here are sensitive to discriminate between schizophrenia and healthy mental state, and could be implemented in social robots to assess the mental state of people in care."
https://openalex.org/W3129440068,"Background High altitude exposure induces overload of right-sided heart and may further predispose to supraventricular arrhythmia. It has been reported that atrial mechanical dyssynchrony is associated with atrial arrhythmia. Whether high altitude exposure causes higher right atrial (RA) dyssynchrony is still unknown. The aim of study was to investigate the effect of high altitude exposure on right atrial mechanical synchrony. Methods In this study, 98 healthy young men underwent clinical examination and echocardiography at sea level (400 m) and high altitude (4100 m) after an ascent within 7 days. RA dyssynchrony was defined as inhomogeneous timing to peak strain and strain rate using 2D speckle-tracking echocardiography. Results Following high altitude exposure, standard deviation of the time to peak strain (SD-TPS) [36.2 (24.5, 48.6) ms vs. 21.7 (12.9, 32.1) ms, p&lt;0.001] and SD-TPS as percentage of R–R’ interval (4.6 ± 2.1% vs. 2.5 ± 1.8%, p&lt;0.001) significantly increased. Additionally, subjects with higher SD-TPS (%) at high altitude presented decreased right ventricular global longitudinal strain and RA active emptying fraction, but increased RA minimal volume index, which were not observed in lower group. Multivariable analysis showed that mean pulmonary arterial pressure and tricuspid E/A were independently associated with SD-TPS (%) at high altitude. Conclusion Our data for the first time demonstrated that high altitude exposure causes RA dyssynchrony in healthy young men, which may be secondary to increased pulmonary arterial pressure. In addition, subjects with higher RA dyssynchrony presented worse RA contractile function and right ventricular performance."
https://openalex.org/W3132679360,"Magnetic ratcheting cytometry is a promising approach to separate magnetically-labeled cells and magnetic particles based on the quantity of magnetic material. We have previously reported on the ability of this technique to separate magnetically-labeled cells. Here, with a new chip design, containing high aspect ratio permalloy micropillar arrays, we demonstrate the ability of this technique to rapidly concentrate and collect superparamagnetic iron oxide particles. The platform consists of a mechatronic wheel used to generate and control a cycling external magnetic field that impinges on a “ratcheting chip.” The ratcheting chip is created by electroplating a 2D array of high aspect ratio permalloy micropillars onto a glass slide, which is embedded in a thin polymer layer to create a planar surface above the micropillars. By varying magnetic field frequency and direction through wheel rotation rate and angle, we direct particle movement on chip. We explore the operating conditions for this system, identifying the effects of varying ratcheting frequency, along with time, on the dynamics and resulting concentration of these magnetic particles. We also demonstrate the ability of the system to rapidly direct the movement of superparamagnetic iron oxide particles of varying sizes. Using this technique, 2.8 μm, 500 nm, and 100 nm diameter superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, suspended within an aqueous fluid, were concentrated. We further define the ability of the system to concentrate 2.8 μm superparamagnetic iron oxide particles, present in a liquid suspension, into a small chip surface area footprint, achieving a 100-fold surface area concentration, and achieving a concentration factor greater than 200%. The achieved concentration factor of greater than 200% could be greatly increased by reducing the amount of liquid extracted at the chip outlet, which would increase the ability of achieving highly sensitive downstream analytical techniques. Magnetic ratcheting-based enrichment may be useful in isolating and concentrating subsets of magnetically-labeled cells for diagnostic automation."
https://openalex.org/W3132315404,"The present study aims to clarify the effects of bilateral contraction on the ability and accuracy of rapid force production at the submaximal force level. Eleven right-handed participants performed rapid gripping as fast and precisely as they could in unilateral (UL) and bilateral (BL) contractions in a standing position. Participants were required to impinge a grip force of 30% and 50% of their maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). Ability and accuracy of rapid force production were evaluated using the rate of force development (RFD) and force error, respectively. The data analysis did not observe a significant difference in the RFD between UL and BL contractions in both 30% (420±86 vs. 413±106%MVC/s, p = 0.34) and 50% of MVC (622±84 vs. 619±103%MVC/s, p = 0.77). Although the RFD to peak force ratio (RFD/PF) in BL contraction was lower than in UL in 30% of MVC (12.8±2.8 vs. 13.4±2.7, p = 0.003), it indicated a small effect size (d = 0.22) of the difference between UL and BL in RFD/PF. The absolute force error of BL contraction was higher than of UL contraction in 30% (4.67±2.64 vs. 3.64±1.13%MVC, p = 0.005) and 50% of MVC (5.53±2.94 vs. 3.53±0.71%MVC, p = 0.009). In addition, medium and large effect sizes were observed in absolute force error from 30% (d = 0.51) and 50% of MVC (d = 0.94), respectively. In conclusion, results indicated that the bilateral contraction reduced in the ability and accuracy of rapid force production at the submaximal force level. Nevertheless, the present results suggest that the noticeable effect of bilateral contraction is more prominent on the accuracy than in the ability of rapid force production at the submaximal force level."
https://openalex.org/W3133165529,"Short DNA oligonucleotides (~4 mer) have been used to index samples from different sources, such as in multiplex sequencing. Presently, longer oligonucleotides (8–12 mer) are being used as molecular barcodes with which to distinguish among raw DNA molecules in many high-tech sequence analyses, including low-frequent mutation detection, quantitative transcriptome analysis, and single-cell sequencing. Despite some advantages of using molecular barcodes with random sequences, such an approach, however, makes it impossible to know the exact sequences used in an experiment and can lead to inaccurate interpretation due to misclustering of barcodes arising from the occurrence of unexpected mutations in the barcodes. The present study introduces a tool developed for selecting an optimal barcode subset during molecular barcoding. The program considers five barcode factors: GC content, homopolymers, simple sequence repeats with repeated units of dinucleotides, Hamming distance, and complementarity between barcodes. To evaluate a selected barcode set, penalty scores for the factors are defined based on their distributions observed in random barcodes. The algorithm employed in the program comprises two steps: i) random generation of an initial set and ii) optimal barcode selection via iterative replacement. Users can execute the program by inputting barcode length and the number of barcodes to be generated. Furthermore, the program accepts a user’s own values for other parameters, including penalty scores, for advanced use, allowing it to be applied in various conditions. In many test runs to obtain 100000 barcodes with lengths of 12 nucleotides, the program showed fast performance, efficient enough to generate optimal barcode sequences with merely the use of a desktop PC. We also showed that VFOS has comparable performance, flexibility in program running, consideration of simple sequence repeats, and fast computation time in comparison with other two tools (DNABarcodes and FreeBarcodes). Owing to the versatility and fast performance of the program, we expect that many researchers will opt to apply it for selecting optimal barcode sets during their experiments, including next-generation sequencing."
