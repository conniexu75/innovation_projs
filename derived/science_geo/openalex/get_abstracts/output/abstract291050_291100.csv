https://openalex.org/W2056216751,"High-resolution Viking orbiter images show evidence for quasi-viscous relaxation of topography. The relaxation is believed to be due to creep deformation of ice in near-surface materials. The global distribution of the inferred ground ice shows a pronounced latitudinal dependence. The equatorial regions of Mars appear to be ice-poor, while the heavily cratered terrain poleward of ± 30° latitude appears to be ice-rich. The style of creep poleward of ± 30° varies with latitude, possibly due to variations in ice rheology with temperature. The distribution suggests that ice at low latitudes, which is not in equilibrium with the present atmosphere, has been lost via sublimation and diffusion through the regolith, thereby causing a net poleward transport of ice over martian history."
https://openalex.org/W2105443754,"Previous studies have suggested that hydroxymethanesulfonate ion (HMSA) can be an important species in fog and cloud water. Formation of HMSA explains observed excesses of sulfur in the S(IV) state (+4 oxidation state) and formaldehyde (CH(2)O) in fogs and clouds. HMSA was determined in fog water by a novel ion-pairing chromatographic technique. Concentrations in samples collected in Bakersfield, California, within 5 kilometers of major sources of sulfur dioxide (SO(2)), were as high as 300 micromoles per liter. Total CH(2)O and S(IV) concentrations, which were measured independently, ranged from 10 to 200 and 5 to more than 300 micromoles per liter, respectively. Concentrations of CH(2)O, S(IV), and HMSA at Buttonwillow, California, which is 15 kilometers from the nearest source of SO(2), were less than those at Bakersfield but not absent. These data confirm that HMSA forms in atmospheric water droplets and can reach appreciable concentrations. HMSA represents an important source of acidity for water droplets and may also play a role in long-distance transport and transformation of SO(2)."

Galaxies evolve by interacting with their environment and especially with each other. During brief but often fierce galactic encounters, gravitational forces generate strong tides that survive as telltale signatures for billions of years. Because these so-called collisions dissipate orbital energy, galaxies on bound orbits may eventually merge. Collisions and mergers are responsible for a great variety of phenomena, including the triggering of widespread star formation in galaxies and the fueling of nuclear activity in quasars. Evidence is accumulating that not all galaxies formed shortly after the Big Bang. A sizable fraction of them may have formed later, and many are still experiencing significant dynamical evolution."

However, little is known of how these artifacts could be used. We describe three experiments in the carving of wood implments with stone tools alone, and we outline some of the problems of making and applying a do-it- yolur-self lithic tool kit."
