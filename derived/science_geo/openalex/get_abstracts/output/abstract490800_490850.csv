https://openalex.org/W2019441910,"Bariatric surgical procedures, such as vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), are at present the most effective therapy for the treatment of obesity, and are associated with considerable improvements in co-morbidities, including type-2 diabetes mellitus. The underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to these benefits remain largely undetermined, despite offering the potential to reveal new targets for therapeutic intervention. Substantial changes in circulating total bile acids are known to occur after VSG. Moreover, bile acids are known to regulate metabolism by binding to the nuclear receptor FXR (farsenoid-X receptor, also known as NR1H4). We therefore examined the results of VSG surgery applied to mice with diet-induced obesity and targeted genetic disruption of FXR. Here we demonstrate that the therapeutic value of VSG does not result from mechanical restriction imposed by a smaller stomach. Rather, VSG is associated with increased circulating bile acids, and associated changes to gut microbial communities. Moreover, in the absence of FXR, the ability of VSG to reduce body weight and improve glucose tolerance is substantially reduced. These results point to bile acids and FXR signalling as an important molecular underpinning for the beneficial effects of this weight-loss surgery."
https://openalex.org/W1985928174,"Patients with melanomas carrying an activating BRAF mutation respond to treatment with BRAF inhibitors although resistance to the inhibitor usually emerges; this resistance is shown to arise through increased expression of receptor tyrosine kinases such as EGFR; however, these changes decrease cell fitness and during a break from inhibitor treatment these cells are selected against, revealing that some patients who acquire EGFR expression may benefit from inhibitor re-treatment after a drug holiday. Melanomas carrying a mutant BRAF gene generally respond to treatment with BRAF inhibitors, but in the majority of cases resistant cancer clones emerge. It has been shown that such resistant clones can nevertheless exhibit reduced fitness when the drug is removed. This paper demonstrates a molecular mechanism underlying this observation. Rene Bernards and colleagues show that a signalling cascade leading from suppression of SOX10 to increased expression of the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene confers resistance to BRAF inhibitors and at the same time reduces melanoma cell proliferation and induces senescence in the absence of inhibitors. With preliminary evidence that this pathway is induced in patients who have developed resistance, the authors suggest that temporary withdrawal of BRAF inhibitors — a drug holiday — would reverse induced EGFR expression and thus may re-sensitize melanoma cells to BRAF inhibition when treatment is reinstated. Treatment of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma by small molecule drugs that target the BRAF or MEK kinases can be effective, but resistance develops invariably1,2. In contrast, colon cancers that harbour the same BRAF(V600E) mutation are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors, due to feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)3,4. Here we show that 6 out of 16 melanoma tumours analysed acquired EGFR expression after the development of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using a chromatin-regulator-focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, we find that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) in melanoma causes activation of TGF-β signalling, thus leading to upregulation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), which confer resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Expression of EGFR in melanoma or treatment with TGF-β results in a slow-growth phenotype with cells displaying hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence. However, EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. In a heterogeneous population of melanoma cells having varying levels of SOX10 suppression, cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are rapidly enriched in the presence of drug, but this is reversed when the drug treatment is discontinued. We find evidence for SOX10 loss and/or activation of TGF-β signalling in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples. Our findings provide a rationale for why some BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma patients may regain sensitivity to these drugs after a ‘drug holiday’ and identify patients with EGFR-positive melanoma as a group that may benefit from re-treatment after a drug holiday."
https://openalex.org/W1988548899,"This study finds that triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) show an increased basal level of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the XBP1 branch of the unfolded protein response; furthermore, XBP1 promotes tumour formation of TNBC cell lines by interacting with and regulating HIF1α. Laurie Glimcher and colleagues report that in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), the tumour cells show an increased basal level of endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the XBP1 branch of the unfolded protein response, a major cellular stress response pathway in the tumour microenvironment. TNBC tumours lack receptors for oestrogen, progesterone and HER2, making them recalcitrant to many drugs through an absence of targets. The authors go on to show that XBP1 promotes tumour formation in TNBC cell lines by interacting with and regulating HIF1α in the absence of hypoxia. This study highlights an important link between two major stress pathways in TNBCs and suggests possible therapeutic interventions for this aggressive form of breast cancer. Cancer cells induce a set of adaptive response pathways to survive in the face of stressors due to inadequate vascularization1. One such adaptive pathway is the unfolded protein (UPR) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response mediated in part by the ER-localized transmembrane sensor IRE1 (ref. 2) and its substrate XBP1 (ref. 3). Previous studies report UPR activation in various human tumours4,5,6, but the role of XBP1 in cancer progression in mammary epithelial cells is largely unknown. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)—a form of breast cancer in which tumour cells do not express the genes for oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and HER2 (also called ERBB2 or NEU)—is a highly aggressive malignancy with limited treatment options7,8. Here we report that XBP1 is activated in TNBC and has a pivotal role in the tumorigenicity and progression of this human breast cancer subtype. In breast cancer cell line models, depletion of XBP1 inhibited tumour growth and tumour relapse and reduced the CD44highCD24low population. Hypoxia-inducing factor 1α (HIF1α) is known to be hyperactivated in TNBCs9,10. Genome-wide mapping of the XBP1 transcriptional regulatory network revealed that XBP1 drives TNBC tumorigenicity by assembling a transcriptional complex with HIF1α that regulates the expression of HIF1α targets via the recruitment of RNA polymerase II. Analysis of independent cohorts of patients with TNBC revealed a specific XBP1 gene expression signature that was highly correlated with HIF1α and hypoxia-driven signatures and that strongly associated with poor prognosis. Our findings reveal a key function for the XBP1 branch of the UPR in TNBC and indicate that targeting this pathway may offer alternative treatment strategies for this aggressive subtype of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2097401587,"Animal transcriptomes are dynamic, with each cell type, tissue and organ system expressing an ensemble of transcript isoforms that give rise to substantial diversity. Here we have identified new genes, transcripts and proteins using poly(A)+ RNA sequencing from Drosophila melanogaster in cultured cell lines, dissected organ systems and under environmental perturbations. We found that a small set of mostly neural-specific genes has the potential to encode thousands of transcripts each through extensive alternative promoter usage and RNA splicing. The magnitudes of splicing changes are larger between tissues than between developmental stages, and most sex-specific splicing is gonad-specific. Gonads express hundreds of previously unknown coding and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), some of which are antisense to protein-coding genes and produce short regulatory RNAs. Furthermore, previously identified pervasive intergenic transcription occurs primarily within newly identified introns. The fly transcriptome is substantially more complex than previously recognized, with this complexity arising from combinatorial usage of promoters, splice sites and polyadenylation sites. A large-scale transcriptome analysis in Drosophila melanogaster, across tissues, cell types and conditions, provides insights into global patterns and diversity of transcription initiation, splicing, polyadenylation and non-coding RNA expression."
https://openalex.org/W2104696999,"As the concentrations of highly consumed nutrients, particularly glucose, are generally lower in tumours than in normal tissues, cancer cells must adapt their metabolism to the tumour microenvironment. A better understanding of these adaptations might reveal cancer cell liabilities that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit. Here we developed a continuous-flow culture apparatus (Nutrostat) for maintaining proliferating cells in low-nutrient media for long periods of time, and used it to undertake competitive proliferation assays on a pooled collection of barcoded cancer cell lines cultured in low-glucose conditions. Sensitivity to low glucose varies amongst cell lines, and an RNA interference (RNAi) screen pinpointed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as the major pathway required for optimal proliferation in low glucose. We found that cell lines most sensitive to low glucose are defective in the OXPHOS upregulation that is normally caused by glucose limitation as a result of either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in complex I genes or impaired glucose utilization. These defects predict sensitivity to biguanides, antidiabetic drugs that inhibit OXPHOS, when cancer cells are grown in low glucose or as tumour xenografts. Notably, the biguanide sensitivity of cancer cells with mtDNA mutations was reversed by ectopic expression of yeast NDI1, a ubiquinone oxidoreductase that allows bypass of complex I function. Thus, we conclude that mtDNA mutations and impaired glucose utilization are potential biomarkers for identifying tumours with increased sensitivity to OXPHOS inhibitors."

https://openalex.org/W2070007455,"Changes in gene dosage are a major driver of cancer, known to be caused by a finite, but increasingly well annotated, repertoire of mutational mechanisms. This can potentially generate correlated copy-number alterations across hundreds of linked genes, as exemplified by the 2% of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with recurrent amplification of megabase regions of chromosome 21 (iAMP21). We used genomic, cytogenetic and transcriptional analysis, coupled with novel bioinformatic approaches, to reconstruct the evolution of iAMP21 ALL. Here we show that individuals born with the rare constitutional Robertsonian translocation between chromosomes 15 and 21, rob(15;21)(q10;q10)c, have approximately 2,700-fold increased risk of developing iAMP21 ALL compared to the general population. In such cases, amplification is initiated by a chromothripsis event involving both sister chromatids of the Robertsonian chromosome, a novel mechanism for cancer predisposition. In sporadic iAMP21, breakage-fusion-bridge cycles are typically the initiating event, often followed by chromothripsis. In both sporadic and rob(15;21)c-associated iAMP21, the final stages frequently involve duplications of the entire abnormal chromosome. The end-product is a derivative of chromosome 21 or the rob(15;21)c chromosome with gene dosage optimized for leukaemic potential, showing constrained copy-number levels over multiple linked genes. Thus, dicentric chromosomes may be an important precipitant of chromothripsis, as we show rob(15;21)c to be constitutionally dicentric and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles generate dicentric chromosomes somatically. Furthermore, our data illustrate that several cancer-specific mutational processes, applied sequentially, can coordinate to fashion copy-number profiles over large genomic scales, incrementally refining the fitness benefits of aggregated gene dosage changes."
https://openalex.org/W2100275618,"Until now, rings have been detected in the Solar System exclusively around the four giant planets. Here we report the discovery of the first minor-body ring system around the Centaur object (10199) Chariklo, a body with equivalent radius 124$\pm$9 km. A multi-chord stellar occultation revealed the presence of two dense rings around Chariklo, with widths of about 7 km and 3 km, optical depths 0.4 and 0.06, and orbital radii 391 and 405 km, respectively. The present orientation of the ring is consistent with an edge-on geometry in 2008, thus providing a simple explanation for the dimming of Chariklo's system between 1997 and 2008, and for the gradual disappearance of ice and other absorption features in its spectrum over the same period. This implies that the rings are partially composed of water ice. These rings may be the remnants of a debris disk, which were possibly confined by embedded kilometre-sized satellites."

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing a Tet-on RORα or RORγ expression vector and a ROR-responsive element (RORE)-LUC reporter, and a mammalian 2-hybrid model examining the interaction between the ligand binding domain (LBD) of RORα or RORγ with an LBD-interacting LXXLL-peptide, were used to study ROR-antagonist activities. These assays revealed that 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)2D3 function as antagonists of RORα and RORγ. Moreover, 20(OH)D3 inhibited the activation of the promoter of the Bmal1 and G6pase genes, targets of RORα, and 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)2D3 inhibited Il17 promoter activity in Jurkat cells overexpressing RORα or RORγ. Molecular modeling using crystal structures of the LBDs of RORα and RORγ revealed docking scores for 20(OH)D3, 20, 23(OH)2D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 similar to those of the natural ligands, predicting good binding to the receptor. Notably, 20(OH)D3, 20,23(OH)2D3, and 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibited RORE-mediated activation of a reporter in keratinocytes and melanoma cells and inhibited IL-17 production by immune cells. Our study identifies a novel signaling pathway, in which 20(OH)D3 and 20,23(OH)2D3 act as antagonists or inverse agonists of RORα and RORγ, that opens new possibilities for local (skin) or systemic regulation.—Slominski, A.

https://openalex.org/W2030323580,"The intracellular metabolism and cytostatic activity of the anticancer drug gemcitabine (2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine; dFdC) was severely compromised in Mycoplasma hyorhinis-infected tumor cell cultures. Pronounced deamination of dFdC to its less cytostatic metabolite 2',2'-difluoro-2'-deoxyuridine was observed, both in cell extracts and spent culture medium (i.e. tumor cell-free but mycoplasma-containing) of mycoplasma-infected tumor cells. This indicates that the decreased antiproliferative activity of dFdC in such cells is attributed to a mycoplasma cytidine deaminase causing rapid drug catabolism. Indeed, the cytostatic activity of gemcitabine could be restored by the co-administration of tetrahydrouridine (a potent cytidine deaminase inhibitor). Additionally, mycoplasma-derived pyrimidine nucleoside phosphorylase (PyNP) activity indirectly potentiated deamination of dFdC: the natural pyrimidine nucleosides uridine, 2'-deoxyuridine and thymidine inhibited mycoplasma-associated dFdC deamination but were efficiently catabolized (removed) by mycoplasma PyNP. The markedly lower anabolism and related cytostatic activity of dFdC in mycoplasma-infected tumor cells was therefore also (partially) restored by a specific TP/PyNP inhibitor (TPI), or by exogenous thymidine. Consequently, no effect on the cytostatic activity of dFdC was observed in tumor cell cultures infected with a PyNP-deficient Mycoplasma pneumoniae strain. Because it has been reported that some commensal mycoplasma species (including M. hyorhinis) preferentially colonize tumor tissue in cancer patients, our findings suggest that the presence of mycoplasmas in the tumor microenvironment could be a limiting factor for the anticancer efficiency of dFdC-based chemotherapy. Accordingly, a significantly decreased antitumor effect of dFdC was observed in mice bearing M. hyorhinis-infected murine mammary FM3A tumors compared with uninfected tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2111677023,"The concept of “biased agonism” arises from the recognition that the ability of an agonist to induce a receptor-mediated response (i.e. “efficacy”) can differ across the multiple signal transduction pathways (e.g. G protein and β-arrestin (βarr)) emanating from a single GPCR. Despite the therapeutic promise of biased agonism, the molecular mechanism(s) whereby biased agonists selectively engage signaling pathways remain elusive. This is due in large part to the challenges associated with quantifying ligand efficacy in cells. To address this, we developed a cell-free approach to directly quantify the transducer-specific molecular efficacies of balanced and biased ligands for the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), a prototypic GPCR. Specifically, we defined efficacy in allosteric terms, equating shifts in ligand affinity (i.e. KLo/KHi) at AT1R-Gq and AT1R-βarr2 fusion proteins with their respective molecular efficacies for activating Gq and βarr2. Consistent with ternary complex model predictions, transducer-specific molecular efficacies were strongly correlated with cellular efficacies for activating Gq and βarr2. Subsequent comparisons across transducers revealed that biased AT1R agonists possess biased molecular efficacies that were in strong agreement with the signaling bias observed in cellular assays. These findings not only represent the first measurements of the thermodynamic driving forces underlying differences in ligand efficacy between transducers but also support a molecular mechanism whereby divergent transducer-specific molecular efficacies generate biased agonism at a GPCR.

Ligands that bind and activate GPCRs, termed agonists, initiate highly conserved signaling and regulatory cascades. These are marked by receptor interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins which promote second messenger generation, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) which phosphorylate the activated receptors, and β-arrestins (βarrs) which bind to the phosphorylated receptors and attenuate signaling (1Pierce K.L.

Recently, however, two interrelated and dramatic paradigm shifts have changed our understanding of how GPCRs function. In the first it has been appreciated that interaction of the receptors with βarr1 and βarr2 leads not only to desensitization of their G protein-mediated actions and endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits but also to activation of numerous recently appreciated signaling pathways by virtue of their ability to serve as multifunctional scaffolds and adaptors (2Lefkowitz R.J.

In the second paradigm shift, the “two state” model of receptor action that postulates an inactive (R) conformation of the receptor in equilibrium with a unitary active (R*) conformation has given way to models in which receptors exist in multiple ligand-specific active (R*n) conformations (6Yao X.

It is now generally accepted that the ability of an agonist to induce a receptor-mediated response (i.e. efficacy) can vary across the distinct signaling pathways emanating from a single GPCR, a phenomenon conceptualized within the frameworks of biased agonism (15Reiter E.

Ther. 2011; 336: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In the limit case, completely biased agonists antagonize one arm of signaling (e.g. G protein-mediated) while simultaneously activating another (e.g. βarr-mediated). Peptide analogs of angiotensin II (AngII), which serves as the endogenous agonist for the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), represent some of the most striking examples of completely biased agonists to date (17Rajagopal S.

Measurements of ligand bias and functional affinity.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 483Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 32Rajagopal S. Quantifying biased agonism: understanding the links between affinity and efficacy.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2013; 12: 483Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Alternatively, defining efficacy in precise chemical terms would bypass these limitations and permit the accurate quantitation of ligand efficacy at distinct transducer pathways in vitro, thereby facilitating investigation of the molecular basis of biased agonism. Accordingly, we developed a cell-free approach to quantify the molecular efficacies of balanced and biased AT1R agonists for activating G protein and βarr pathways (i.e. “transducer-specific molecular efficacies”). This allowed us to test the hypothesis that biased agonism arises from differences in ligand-receptor-transducer ternary complex (LRT) interactions. Our approach was based on the following fundamental tenets: 1) GPCRs are prototypic allosteric proteins (33Onaran H.O. Costa T. Agonist efficacy and allosteric models of receptor action.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 812: 98-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 34Kenakin T.P. Biased signalling and allosteric machines: new vistas and challenges for drug discovery.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); 2) efficacy, as it is conceived to reside within the LRT ternary complex (35De Lean A. Stadel J.M. Lefkowitz R.J.

Biased signalling and allosteric machines: new vistas and challenges for drug discovery.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2012; 165: 1659-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 37Onaran H.O. Costa T. Where have all the active receptor states gone?.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2012; 8: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Based on these assumptions we equated shifts in the binding affinities (i.e. KLo/KHi) of ligands at AT1R-Gq and AT1R-βarr2 fusion proteins with their molecular efficacies for activating Gq and βarr2, respectively. The transducer-specific molecular efficacies reported here represent the first attempt to quantify the thermodynamic driving forces underlying differences in ligand efficacy between transducers. AT1R-Gq and AT1R-βarr2 fusion proteins containing a cleavable N-terminal Hemophilus influenza hemagglutinin membrane insertion signal sequence and N-terminal FLAG epitope tag were generated via overlapping PCR. For the AT1R-Gq fusion protein, PCR amplicons of full-length human AT1R cDNA (NM_009585) and full-length human Gq cDNA (NM_002072) were digested with DpnI, gel-purified, and combined at a ratio of 1:1. The mixture was digested with T4 DNA polymerase and quenched with dCTP before ligation with T7 DNA ligase. A 17-amino acid linker (GGGGSAEAAAKAGGGGSM) was subsequently introduced via insertional mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For the AT1R-βarr2 fusion protein, PCR amplicons of full-length human AT1R cDNA and full-length rat βarr2 cDNA (NM_012911) were ligated according to the above procedure. A stop codon was subsequently inserted at amino acid 395 to generate a truncated, phosphorylation-independent βarr2. The resulting AT1R (1152 bp, 44 kDa), AT1R-Gq (2280 bp, 87 kDa), and AT1R-βarr2 (2334 bp, 88 kDa) constructs were subcloned into pcDNA3 and sequenced (Duke DNA Analysis Facility, Durham, NC) before use. HEK 293 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified environment (5% CO2) using standard minimum Eagle's growth medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Monoclonal cell lines stably expressing high levels of AT1R (clone #15), AT1R-Gq (clone #15), or AT1R-βarr2 (clone #23) were selected from a pool of HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with 2 μg of AT1R, AT1R-Gq, or AT1R-βarr2 cDNA. Selection was initiated and maintained with 500 μg/ml G418. HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human AT1R were cultured for inositol monophosphate (IP1) accumulation assays as previously described (18Violin J.D. DeWire S.M. Yamashita D. Rominger D.H. Nguyen L. Schiller K. Whalen E.J. Gowen M. Lark M.W. Selectively engaging β-arrestins at the angiotensin II type 1 receptor reduces blood pressure and increases cardiac performance.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2010; 335: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). U2OS cells were cultured for internalization assays as described by the manufacturer (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA). AT1R, AT1R-Gq, and AT1R-βarr2 receptor proteins were immunoprecipitated from stable cell lines using standard procedures. Briefly, cells were solubilized in cold lysis buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, 0.01% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture). After centrifugation, the cleared lysate was incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-M2 FLAG-agarose beads. Receptors bound to beads were washed extensively with cold lysis buffer, deglycosylated with peptide N-glycosidase F, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 400 μm FLAG peptide (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated receptors were resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE gels and immunoblotted using standard procedures. Immunoreactive bands representing the AT1R (polyclonal α-FLAG, Sigma), the AT1R-Gq fusion protein (polyclonal α-Gq, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Dallas, TX), and the AT1R-βarr2 fusion protein (polyclonal α-βarr2, A1CT (38Kohout T.A. Lin F.S. Perry S.J. Conner D.A. Lefkowitz R.J. β-Arrestin 1 and 2 differentially regulate heptahelical receptor signaling and trafficking.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 1601-1606PubMed Google Scholar)) were visualized using GeneSnap Imaging software (Syngene, Frederick, MD). To quantify Gq molecular efficacy, a single large batch of purified membrane was prepared from AT1R (clone #15)- or AT1R-Gq (clone #15)-expressing cells. High levels of receptor expression were achieved by co-transfecting stable lines (FuGENE 6, Roche Applied Science) with additional receptor cDNA and the pAdvantage vector (ratio of 4:1, Promega, Madison, WI) as well as culturing in the presence of 2% DMSO. Cells were harvested in cold wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and Dounce-homogenized (100 strokes) in cold homogenization buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.4). Following differential centrifugation, the P2 microsomal membrane fraction was resuspended in cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, protease inhibitor mixture, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% BSA, and 10% glycerol, pH 7.4), aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C until use. To quantify βarr2 molecular efficacy, a modified version of the aforementioned procedure was used to prepare a single large batch of purified membrane from AT1R (clone #15)- or AT1R-βarr2 (clone #23)-expressing cells. Specifically, cells were co-transfected with a membrane-targeted GRK2 mutant (i.e. CAAX GRK2) to promote receptor phosphorylation and βarr2 coupling (39Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Isoprenylation in regulation of signal transduction by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases.Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Consequently, phosphatase inhibitors (5 nm microcystin LF, 10 nm calyculin A, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mm β-glycerophosphate) were added to homogenization and resuspension buffers. Angiotensin II was synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. (Piscataway, NJ). TRV120023, TRV120026, TRV120034, TRV120044, TRV120045, TRV120055, and TRV120056 were developed and supplied by Trevena, Inc. (King of Prussia, PA). SII was synthesized by the Molecular Biotechnology Core Laboratory of the Lerner Research Institute (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH). Telmisartan was obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Ontario, Canada). PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Waltham, MA) supplied both 125I-Sar1,Ile8-AngII, 2200 Ci/mmol) and 125I-angiotensin II (125I-AngII, 2200 Ci/mmol). Competition radioligand binding assays using unfused and transducer-fused AT1R-expressing membranes were conducted in parallel to facilitate rigorous analysis (see “Experimental Procedures”). Competition binding assays measuring Gq molecular efficacy were performed in a Gq assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% BSA) containing 50 pm 125I-Sar1,Ile8-AngII, AT1R (0.5 μg) or AT1R-Gq (0.25 μg) membranes, and a serial dilution of test ligand. Binding assays measuring βarr2 molecular efficacy were performed in βarr2 assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm potassium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2% BSA) containing 50 pm 125I-Sar1,Ile8-AngII, AT1R + CAAX GRK2 (1 μg) or AT1R-βarr2 + CAAX GRK2 (0.4 μg) membranes, and a serial dilution of test ligand. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10 μm telmisartan, whereas total binding was determined in the absence of a competitor. To ensure accurate low affinity determination, binding assays on unfused AT1R membranes included a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog 5′-guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GPP(NH)P) at 1 μm for Gq assay and 100 μm for βarr2 assay. After a 1.5-h incubation at 25 °C, bound radioactivity was collected on 0.3% polyethyleneimine-treated GF/C filters using cold Gq wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) or cold βarr2 wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 50 mm potassium acetate). Bound radioactivity was quantified on a Packard Cobra gamma counter (GMI, Ramsey, MN). Saturation binding assays were performed on AT1R-Gq and AT1R-βarr2 membranes as described above except that serial dilutions of 125I-AngII (5 pm to 1 nm) and 125I-Sar1,Ile8-AngII (5 pm to 2 nm) were used to label transducer-coupled and total AT1R populations, respectively. IP1 accumulation was measured using the IP-One Tb HTRF kit (Cisbio, Bedford, MA) as described previously (18Violin J.D. DeWire S.M. Yamashita D. Rominger D.H. Nguyen L. Schiller K. Whalen E.J.

Ther. 2010; 335: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). βarr-dependent AT1R internalization was measured using the activated endocytosis assay (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA). Briefly, the human AT1R was transiently expressed in U2OS cells stably expressing an Enzyme Acceptor-tagged βarr2 and an endosome-localized ProLink tag. Cells (20,000 cells/well) were incubated in 96-well plates for 24 h and stimulated with test ligand (100 μm to 0.1 nm) for 30 min or 3 h at 37 °C. AT1R internalization was detected as luminescence resulting from the complementation of β-galactosidase fragments (Enzyme Acceptor and ProLink) within endosomes. Luminescence was detected on a NOVOstar plate reader (BMG Labtech Inc., Cary, NC) using the PathHunter Detection kit (DiscoveRx, Fremont, CA). The PathHunter βarr assay from DiscoveRx (Fremont, CA) measured recruitment of βarr2 to the AT1R for cellular bias calculations as described previously (17Rajagopal S. Ahn S. Rominger D.H. Gowen-MacDonald W. Lam C.M. Dewire S.M. Violin J.D. Lefkowitz R.J. Quantifying ligand bias at seven-transmembrane receptors.Mol.

HEK 293 cells (50,000 cells/well) transiently expressing the unfused AT1R, AT1R-Gq, or AT1R-βarr2 fusion proteins were stimulated with 1 μm AngII for 10 min at 37 °C. Plates were read on a PheraStar reader using a time-resolved fluorescence ratio of 665 nm/615 nm. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was reported as -fold over base-line response. The simplest quantity describing the differential efficacy of ligands at the molecular level is the ligand-induced allosteric effect that governs receptor coupling to the transduction protein (i.e. molecular efficacy; Ref. 36Samama P.

Ligand binding and internal equilibria in proteins.Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 864-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the simultaneous binding of ligand and transduction protein to distinct sites on a receptor permits measurement of the allosteric coupling (i.e. α) between agonist and transduction protein by calculating the ratio of “unconditional” and “conditional” binding constants,KL/KLT=KT/KTL=α(Eq. 1) where KL or KT are the dissociation constants for the ligand (L) or the transducer (T) when each binds to the receptor in the absence of the other, and KL(T) or KT(L) are the dissociation constants when each binds to a receptor already saturated by the other. Because α itself represents an equilibrium constant (i.e. describing the disproportionation reaction: [LRT] + [R] = [LR] + [TR]), this ratio has the connotation of a difference of free-energy changes (ΔΔG) (41Weber G.

https://openalex.org/W2122992227,"Recent research suggests that facial mimicry underlies accurate interpretation of subtle facial expressions. In three experiments, we manipulated mimicry and tested its role in judgments of the genuineness of true and false smiles. Experiment 1 used facial EMG to show that a new mouthguard technique for blocking mimicry modifies both the amount and the time course of facial reactions. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants rated true and false smiles either while wearing mouthguards or when allowed to freely mimic the smiles with or without additional distraction, namely holding a squeeze ball or wearing a finger-cuff heart rate monitor. Results showed that blocking mimicry compromised the decoding of true and false smiles such that they were judged as equally genuine. Together the experiments highlight the role of facial mimicry in judging subtle meanings of facial expressions."
https://openalex.org/W2090411409,"The long-term efficacy of stormwater treatment systems requires continuous pollutant removal without substantial re-release. Hence, the division of incoming pollutants between temporary and permanent removal pathways is fundamental. This is pertinent to nitrogen, a critical water body pollutant, which on a broad level may be assimilated by plants or microbes and temporarily stored, or transformed by bacteria to gaseous forms and permanently lost via denitrification. Biofiltration systems have demonstrated effective removal of nitrogen from urban stormwater runoff, but to date studies have been limited to a 'black-box' approach. The lack of understanding on internal nitrogen processes constrains future design and threatens the reliability of long-term system performance. While nitrogen processes have been thoroughly studied in other environments, including wastewater treatment wetlands, biofiltration systems differ fundamentally in design and the composition and hydrology of stormwater inflows, with intermittent inundation and prolonged dry periods. Two mesocosm experiments were conducted to investigate biofilter nitrogen processes using the stable isotope tracer 15NO3(-) (nitrate) over the course of one inflow event. The immediate partitioning of 15NO3(-) between biotic assimilation and denitrification were investigated for a range of different inflow concentrations and plant species. Assimilation was the primary fate for NO3(-) under typical stormwater concentrations (∼1-2 mg N/L), contributing an average 89-99% of 15NO3(-) processing in biofilter columns containing the most effective plant species, while only 0-3% was denitrified and 0-8% remained in the pore water. Denitrification played a greater role for columns containing less effective species, processing up to 8% of 15NO3(-), and increased further with nitrate loading. This study uniquely applied isotope tracing to biofiltration systems and revealed the dominance of assimilation in stormwater biofilters. The findings raise important questions about nitrogen release upon plant senescence, seasonally and in the long term, which have implications on the management and design of biofiltration systems."

A previously reported high-throughput screen identified the first potent series of inhibitors of IDH1 R132H that were further optimized (14Popovici-Muller J. Saunders J.O. Salituro F.G. Travins J.M.

The series consists of a phenyl-glycine scaffold with one stereocenter. One enantiomer was shown to be predominantly responsible for the activity of the racemic mixture. The inhibitor series was selective for mutant IDH1 over wild-type (WT) IDH1 and had excellent cell activity (IC50 = 70 nm), including the ability to lower 2-HG levels by ∼90% in an in vivo U87MG IDH1 R132H mouse tumor xenograft model (14Popovici-Muller J.

ML309, described herein, is a newly identified and characterized member of the phenyl-glycine series. ML309 is active in both biochemical and cell assays. The time dependence of the effect on 2-HG levels in cells was explored. To gain a deeper understanding of how the substrates, and phenyl-glycine scaffold inhibitors, such as ML309, interact with IDH1 R132H enzyme, a detailed characterization using kinetic and biophysical approaches was undertaken. Based on these results, a compound binding model was proposed that provides a plausible explanation of the inhibitory mechanism and that can be used for future structure and activity relationship studies. All air- or moisture-sensitive reactions were performed under positive pressure of nitrogen with oven-dried glassware. Anhydrous solvents, such as dichloromethane, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, methanol, and triethylamine, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Analytical analysis was performed on an Agilent 1200 series LC/MS (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Sample dissolution in MeOH and analysis were performed at room temperature. The analytical column used was a Chiralcel OD column (4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase was 60:40 ethanol (absolute, 200 proof)/hexane (0.1% diethyl amine) at 1.0 ml/min. The sample was detected with a diode array detector at 220 and 254 nm. Optical rotation was determined with an in-line polarimeter (PDR-Chiral). Purity and enantiomeric excess were determined by this analytical method. All of the analogues tested in the biological assays have a purity greater than 95%. Preparative purification of racemic material was performed on an Agilent 1200 series Prep/LC (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The column used was a Chiralcel OD column (5 × 50 cm, 20 μm). The mobile phase was 60:40 ethanol (absolute, 200 proof)/hexane (0.1% diethyl amine) at 35 ml/min. Fraction collection was triggered by UV absorbance (220 nm). 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian 400-MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm (CHD2OD at 3.31 ppm as internal standard) for MeOH-d4 solutions. High resolution mass spectrometry was recorded on Agilent 6210 time-of-flight LC/MS system. Confirmation of molecular formulae was accomplished using electrospray ionization in the positive mode with the Agilent Masshunter software (version B.02). A solution of isocyanocyclopentane (196 mg, 2.064 mmol), 3-fluoroaniline (229 mg, 2.064 mmol), and 2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl)acetic acid (364 mg, 2.064 mmol) in MeOH (6.9 ml) was treated with 2-methylbenzaldehyde (248 mg, 2.064 mmol). The reaction was warmed to 40 °C and stirred for 4 h and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by silica chromatography (2:98 to 5:95 MeOH/dichloromethane), which afforded racemic ML309 (rac-ML309) (216 mg, 0.446 mmol) in 22% yield. rac-ML309 (216 mg, 0.446 mmol) was separated by chiral chromatography to afford (−)-ML309 (73 mg, 0.151 mmol, >99% enantiomeric excess) and (+)-ML309 (66 mg, 0.136 mmol, >99% enantiomeric excess). (−)-ML309: LC-MS retention time: t1 (Chiralcel OD column; 60:40 EtOH/hexane isocratic) = 2.91 min; [α]D22 = −72.1° (c = 0.86, MeOH); 1H NMR (400 MHz, MeOH-d4) δ ppm 8.01 (s, 1 H), 7.89 (br s, 1 H), 7.65 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1 H), 7.41 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 1 H), 7.32 (t, J = 6.4 Hz, 1 H), 7.27 (t, J = 6.8 Hz, 1 H), 7.14 (d, J = 6.8 Hz, 1 H), 7.07 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 1 H), 6.99 (dt, J = 2.4, 8.0 Hz, 1 H), 6.88 (t, J = 7.2 Hz, 1 H), 6.81 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 1 H), 6.56 (br s, 1H), 6.36 (s, 1H), 5.02 (d, J = 17.2 Hz, 1 H), 4.81 (d, J = 17.6 Hz, 1 H), 4.18 (tt, J = 6.8, 6.8 Hz, 1 H), 2.45 (s, 3 H), 1.94–1.83 (m, 2 H), 1.67–1.27 (m, 8 H); 19F NMR (282 MHz, MeOH-d4) δ, −113.03, −114.12 ppm; high resolution mass spectrometry (electrospray mass ionization) m/z (M+H)+ calculated for C29H29FN4O2, 485.2385; found 485.2335.

A 20 mm DMSO stock of rac-ML309 was dispensed in assay buffer (final concentrations of 2% DMSO, 15% MeCN, 83% assay buffer), 5 mm glutathione (final concentrations of 2% DMSO, 49% MeCN, 49% PBS), or Dulbecco's PBS buffer (2% DMSO, 25% MeCN, 73% Dulbecco's PBS), and the remaining compound was monitored by the area under the curve of the peak at 220 nm by LC/MS at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h. The half-life of rac-ML309 was tested by in vivo mouse pharmacokinetics (PK) using wild-type BALB/c mice (18Korfmacher W.A.

Full-length IDH1 (EC 1.1.1.42 and UniProt accession number O75874), IDH1 R132H, and IDH1 R132C were expressed and purified as described previously (6Dang L. White D.W. Gross S. Bennett B.D.

Both IDH1 R132H and IDH1 R132C protein were expressed with N-terminal His6 tags and purified by standard metal-chelate affinity chromatography techniques; IDH1 R132H was expressed in Escherichia coli, and IDH1 R132C was expressed in insect cells using the BaculoDirect (Invitrogen) baculovirus expression system. Proteins were buffer-exchanged by G25 gel-filtration chromatography into 500 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol and stored at −80 °C. NADPH, α-KG, and buffer components were purchased from Sigma. Experiments were run at room temperature unless otherwise specified. The activity of IDH1 R132H and IDH1 R132C was measured in 384-well plates by coupling NADPH consumption to a diaphorase/resazurin-based detection system and measuring resorufin production (Ex544/Em590) as described previously (6Dang L.

Discovery of the first potent inhibitors of mutant IDH1 that lower tumor 2-HG in vivo.ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2012; 3: 850-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For testing the potency of small molecule inhibitors, an end point-coupled assay system was used, with 2–4 nm enzyme. In this assay, the reactions were run in the α-KG to 2-HG direction with the concomitant oxidation of NADPH to NADP. For IDH1 R132H, a final concentration of 1 mm α-KG and 4 μm NADPH was used; for IDH1 R132C, a final concentration of 200 μm α-KG and 4 μm NADPH was used. The NADPH remaining at the end of a 1-h incubation reaction was measured by the addition of 20 μm resazurin and 10 μg/ml diaphorase, which facilitated the stoichiometric conversion of resazurin to the highly fluorescent resorufin. To test the reversibility of the binding of compound to enzyme, 10× IC50 of the compound and 100× enzyme were incubated for 1 h, at which point the sample was diluted 100-fold and the enzyme reaction was run in kinetic mode monitoring the consumption of NADPH at 340 nm. Data were normalized to control columns representing maximum signal (no enzyme) and minimum signal (all components). WT IDH1 activity was also measured with this coupled diaphorase/resazurin system, but in this case product (NADPH) could be measured directly. Readout interference was tested with a counterscreen assay that contained all components except the proteins. The data were fit in GraphPad Prism 5 (La Jolla, CA) using nonlinear least-squares curve fitting. For determination of the Km(app) of substrates, IDH1 R132H was assayed in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.03% BSA. Reactions where studied in an SFM-400 stop-flow spectrophotometer by monitoring the oxidation state of the co-factor at Ex340/Em450 and used 5–100 nm recombinant protein. Typical reactions were monitored for ∼5 s, and steady-state rates were extracted by linear regression with fluorescence converted to NADPH concentration by a standard curve of NADPH in assay buffer. The equations used to fit the substrate inhibition and product inhibition are described in detail in Ref. 19Copeland R.A. Enzymes: A Practical Introduction to Structure, Mechanism and Data Analysis. Wiley-VCH, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar. IDH1 R132H was labeled with a fluorescent dye NT-647 using the manufacturer's protocol (NanoTemper Technologies, München, Germany). A 16-point titration series of rac-ML309 in DMSO, NADPH in water, α-KG in water, or combinations thereof was transferred to the protein (20 nm) in a buffer containing 0.05% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 150 mm NaCl and equilibrated for 15 min. The final top concentrations were 25 μm for NADPH, 25 mm α-KG, or 500 μm rac-ML309 for the single agent tests. For the competition tests, the substrate was held constant and rac-ML309 was titrated, i.e. α-KG was fixed at 150 mm and rac-ML309 was titrated down from 500 μm or NADPH was fixed at 50 μm and rac-ML309 was titrated down from 500 μm. The final DMSO concentration for each protein-compound sample was 0.5% DMSO. Samples were loaded into Monolith NT hydrophilic treated capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies). A capillary scan was performed followed by the successive measurement of thermophoresis in each capillary on a NanoTemper Monolith NT.115 instrument at room temperature. The IR laser power and the LED power conditions are described in the figure legends. A laser on-time of 30 s and a laser-off time of 5 s were used. The experiment was performed in duplicate, and the fits are reported as mean ± S.D. Data normalization and curve fitting were performed using GraphPad Prism 5. Binding experiments between IDH1 R132H and either NADPH or NADPH/rac-ML309 were performed using SPR measurements on a ProteOn XPR36 instrument (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) at 25 °C. IDH1 R132H (“ligand”) was immobilized at high surface densities (6000–7000 resonance units) on an activated ProteOn HTE nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid sensor chip (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) through the His tag on the IDH1 R132H protein according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ligand was injected five times at a concentration of 20 μg/ml at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 1000 s across two of the six available channels. To perform the binding assays, the various compounds (“analytes”) were injected at different concentrations in running buffer at a flow rate of 100 μl/min for 120 s (NADPH or rac-ML309 alone) or 180 s (rac-ML309 with NADPH), and sensorgrams were recorded. Blank surfaces and interspots (a feature of the ProteOn interaction array system) were used for background corrections using the ProteOn software. The sensorgrams were fit using the ProteOn analysis software. The protein rapidly lost activity on the chip, and therefore the chip was regenerated and the ligand was reloaded for each enzyme-compound test. The analytes tested included NADPH (a five-point 1:3 dilution series starting at 1 μm) and NADPH/rac-ML309 (at 1 μm NADPH constant and a five-point 1:3 dilution of rac-ML309 starting at 3 μm). The running buffer used for ligand loading and testing of NADPH alone or rac-ML309 alone was TBS. For the tests with rac-ML309 and NADPH co-injections, the running buffer was TBS with 1 μm NADPH and 0.25% DMSO. U87MG (human glioblastoma) cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) (Manassas, VA). U87MG is cultured in RPMI 1640, 2 mm l-Glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FBS (Life Technologies). Cells were maintained in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. U87MG cells were infected with lentivirus containing full-length IDH1 R132H (U87MG pLVX-IDH1 R132H-neo or U87MG IDH1 R132H for short). For infection, cells were plated with the viral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (5.0 × 104 cells/ml viral supernatant) and incubated in 5% CO2 at 32 °C for 24 h. After infection, transduced cells were selected using G418 (1 mg/ml) for 2 weeks to generate stable expression cells. U87MG pLVX-IDH1 R132H-neo cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml G418. Cells were seeded at a density of 5000 cells/well into 96-well white solid-bottom microtiter plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2. The next day compounds were prepared in 100% DMSO and then diluted in medium for a final concentration of 0.2% DMSO. Medium was removed from the cell plates, and 200 μl of the compound dilutions were added to each well. After 48 h of incubation with compound at 37 °C, 100 μl of medium was removed from each well and analyzed by LC-MS for 2-HG concentrations as described in Ref. 6Dang L. White D.W. Gross S.

Containing a chiral center, rac-ML309 was separated into its (+) and (−) enantiomers (Fig. 2A). A coupled biochemical assay was used to determine the IC50 values for IDH1 R132H for the (+)-ML309 and (−)-ML309 enantiomers, which were 68 ± 1.2 and 29,000 ± 1.3 nm, respectively (F"
https://openalex.org/W2020047273,"Development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is characterized by accumulation of mutations in several oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We have formerly described the mutation pattern of HNSCC and described NOTCH signaling pathway alterations. Given the complexity of the HNSCC, here we extend the previous study to understand the overall HNSCC mutation context and to discover additional genetic alterations. We performed high depth targeted exon sequencing of 51 highly actionable cancer-related genes with a high frequency of mutation across many cancer types, including head and neck. DNA from primary tumor tissues and matched normal tissues was analyzed for 37 HNSCC patients. We identified 26 non-synonymous or stop-gained mutations targeting 11 of 51 selected genes. These genes were mutated in 17 out of 37 (46%) studied HNSCC patients. Smokers harbored 3.2-fold more mutations than non-smokers. Importantly, TP53 was mutated in 30%, NOTCH1 in 8% and FGFR3 in 5% of HNSCC. HPV negative patients harbored 4-fold more TP53 mutations than HPV positive patients. These data confirm prior reports of the HNSCC mutational profile. Additionally, we detected mutations in two new genes, CEBPA and FES, which have not been previously reported in HNSCC. These data extend the spectrum of HNSCC mutations and define novel mutation targets in HNSCC carcinogenesis, especially for smokers and HNSCC without HPV infection."

Aldehydes readily exchange their carbonyl oxygen with water, making oxygen labeling experiments challenging. BCO1 has been thought to be a monooxygenase, incorporating oxygen from O2 and H2O into its cleavage products. This was based on a study that used conditions that favored oxygen exchange with water. We incubated purified recombinant human BCO1 and β-carotene in either 16O2-H218O or 18O2-H216O medium for 15 min at 37 °C, and the relative amounts of 18O-retinal and 16O-retinal were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. At least 79% of the retinal produced by the reaction has the same oxygen isotope as the O2 gas used. Together with the data from 18O-retinal-H216O and 16O-retinal-H218O incubations to account for nonenzymatic oxygen exchange, our results show that BCO1 incorporates only oxygen from O2 into retinal. Thus, BCO1 is a dioxygenase. β-Carotene 15–15′-oxygenase (BCO1) catalyzes the oxidative cleavage of dietary provitamin A carotenoids to retinal (vitamin A aldehyde).

https://openalex.org/W1996108897,"The thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter, NCC, is the major NaCl transport protein in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The transport activity of NCC can be regulated by phosphorylation, but knowledge of modulation of NCC trafficking by phosphorylation is limited. In this study, we generated novel tetracycline-inducible Madin-Darby canine kidney type I (MDCKI) cell lines expressing NCC to examine the role of NCC phosphorylation and ubiquitylation on NCC endocytosis. In MDCKI-NCC cells, NCC was highly glycosylated at molecular weights consistent with NCC monomers and dimers. NCC constitutively cycles to the apical plasma membrane of MDCKI-NCC cells, with 20-30% of the membrane pool of NCC internalized within 30 min. The use of dynasore, PitStop2, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, nystatin, and filipin (specific inhibitors of either clathrin-dependent or -independent endocytosis) demonstrated that NCC is internalized via a clathrin-mediated pathway. Reduction of endocytosis resulted in greater levels of NCC in the plasma membrane. Immunogold electron microscopy confirmed the association of NCC with the clathrin-mediated internalization pathway in rat DCT cells. Compared with controls, inducing phosphorylation of NCC via low chloride treatment or mimicking phosphorylation by replacing Thr-53, Thr-58, and Ser-71 residues with Asp resulted in increased membrane abundance and reduced rates of NCC internalization. NCC ubiquitylation was lowest in the conditions with greatest NCC phosphorylation, thus providing a mechanism for the reduced endocytosis. In conclusion, our data support a model where NCC is constitutively cycled to the plasma membrane, and upon stimulation, it can be phosphorylated to both increase NCC activity and decrease NCC endocytosis, together increasing NaCl transport in the DCT."

Evaluating smoker macrophages, we found significant down-regulation of multiple microRNAs (miRNAs). This work investigates the hypothesis that cigarette smoke alters mature miRNA expression in lung macrophages by inhibiting processing of primary miRNA transcripts. Studies on smoker alveolar macrophages showed a defect in miRNA maturation. Studies on the miRNA biogenesis machinery led us to focus on the cytosolic RNA endonuclease, DICER. DICER cleaves the stem-loop structure from pre-miRNAs, allowing them to dissociate into their mature 20–22-nucleotide single-stranded form. DICER activity assays confirmed impaired DICER activity following cigarette smoke exposure. Further protein studies demonstrated a decreased expression of the native 217-kDa form of DICER and an accumulation of high molecular weight forms with cigarette smoke exposure. This molecular mass shift was shown to contain SUMO moieties and could be blocked by silencing RNA directed at the primary SUMOylating ligase, Ubc9. In determining the cigarette smoke components responsible for changes in DICER, we found that N-acetylcysteine, an antioxidant and anti-aldehyde, protected DICER protein and activity from cigarette smoke extract. This massive down-regulation of miRNAs (driven in part by alterations in DICER) may be an important regulator of the disease-promoting macrophage phenotype found in the lungs of smokers.

Although multiple lung cell types contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD, evidence strongly supports a key role for alveolar macrophages (33.Robbins C.S. Bauer C.M. Vujicic N. Gaschler G.J.

The role of miRNA levels in regulating cellular genomic tone is an area of active investigation (11.Baek D. Villén J. Shin C. Camargo F.D. Gygi S.P. Bartel D.P.

Fang Z. Khanin R. Rajewsky N. Widespread changes in protein synthesis induced by miRNAs.Nature. 2008; 455: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2791) Google Scholar). Primary miRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus and processed into precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by a nuclear endoribonuclease, DROSHA, in complex with a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, Pasha (known as DGCR8 in vertebrates). The pre-miRNA is an ∼70-base pair double-stranded RNA stem-loop structure that contains the imbedded 22-nucleotide sequence complementary to the mRNA target of interest. Pre-miRNAs are exported from the nucleus, where the cytoplasmic endoribonuclease, DICER, excises the stem-loop, yielding a 20–25-base pair RNA duplex (14.Macrae I.J. Zhou K. Li F. Repic A.

Dicer recognizes the 5′ end of RNA for efficient and accurate processing.Nature. 2011; 475: 201-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). In the cytosol, DICER, in complex with other protein components (transactivating response RNA-binding protein (TRBP), protein kinase RNA activator (PACT), and Argonaut protein Ago2) binds the duplex, slices out the anti-complementary “passenger” RNA strand, and targets it for destruction. The mature miRNA and processing proteins form an RNA-induced silencing complex, which represses translation or enhances degradation of the targeted complementary mRNA. Thus, up- or down-regulation of an miRNA can result in specific regulation of gene expression. The miRNA biogenesis pathway has several potential points for regulatory control. In this paper, we present evidence that cigarette smoke exposure leads to a post-translational modification of DICER, resulting in decreased ribonuclease activity and contributing to a generalized decrease in miRNA expression in smokers' alveolar macrophages.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit (sc-2004), anti-mouse (sc-2005), and anti-goat (sc-2020) antibodies were all obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Culture media used in experiments included serum-free RPMI tissue culture medium with Glutamax (Invitrogen, catalog no. 61870-036) and DMEM (Invitrogen, catalog no. 11095) with 10% FCS (Hyclone Fetal Bovine Serum, SH30071). The University of Iowa Institutional Review Board approved all procedures and protocols described in this work. Written informed consent was obtained, and all clinical investigation has been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Subjects were recruited from the community through the Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science Clinical Core. Inclusion criteria for smoking subjects required at least a 10-pack year history of ongoing cigarette smoking, whereas the nonsmoker control subjects were self-reported never smokers. Subjects were excluded if they had any significant co-morbid conditions, such as pregnancy or other acute or chronic disease, such as preexisting asthma, interstitial lung disease, or cardiovascular disease. Subjects were also excluded if a baseline spirometry revealed that the forced expiratory volume in the first second was less than 60% of the predicted value based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III data set. None of the subjects were using inhaled corticosteroids. After informed consent was obtained, subjects underwent standard flexible bronchoscopy (16.Reisetter A.C. Stebounova L.V. Baltrusaitis J.

Local anesthesia with lidocaine instillation into the upper airway was followed by bronchoalveolar lavage, whereby 20 ml of normal saline was instilled into a tertiary bronchus up to five times in three different lung segments. The first collection out of five was discarded to avoid possible contamination with upper airway secretions or lidocaine. The remaining lavage was filtered through sterile gauze and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min to pellet cellular material. The resulting pellet was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. A sample of the cells were labeled with Wright stain and microscopically examined to determine the proportion of the cells that were macrophages (17.Monick M.M. Carter A.B. Gudmundsson G. Geist L.J.

Aliquots of 5 × 106 cells were stored at −80 °C until the RNA isolation procedure was performed. Cell yields from bronchoscopy of nonsmokers averaged 25 ± 3 × 106 cells and for smokers averaged 67 ± 4 × 106. In all three cohorts, the procedure generated a relatively pure population of alveolar macrophages with fewer than 5% neutrophils or lymphocytes in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Cigarette smoke extract was prepared as described previously (21.Nyunoya T. Monick M.M. Klingelhutz A. Yarovinsky T.O. Cagley J.R. Hunninghake G.W. Cigarette smoke induces cellular senescence.Am. J.

Possible mechanisms of emphysema in cigarette smokers. Release of elastase from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes by cigarette smoke condensate in vitro.Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1978; 117: 317-325PubMed Google Scholar). 10 ml of sterile serum-free RPMI tissue culture media with Glutamax was drawn into a 50-ml plastic syringe. Then 40 ml of cigarette smoke was drawn into the syringe and mixed with the medium by vigorously shaking them together. The smoke was expelled, and the process was repeated until one cigarette was used up. The generated CSE solution was filtered (0.22 μm) to remove large particles (24.Panayiotidis M.I. Stabler S.P. Allen R.H. Ahmad A. White C.W. Cigarette smoke extract increases S-adenosylmethionine and cystathionine in human lung epithelial-like (A549) cells.Chem. Biol.

The resulting solution was designated a 100% CSE solution and was used immediately after generation. For the CSE dialysis experiment, we dialyzed 5% CSE overnight using Thermo Scientific's 2000 and 10,000 molecular weight cut-off Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette GP cassettes. RNA was isolated from alveolar macrophages using the mirVana miRNA Isolation kit (Applied Biosystems (ABI)). The quantity and quality of the RNA samples was assessed using an Experion automated electrophoresis station (Bio-Rad). The RNA quality indicator was above 8 for all samples, where values of greater than 8 indicate primarily intact RNA on a scale of 1–10. After preparation, RNA samples were stored at −80 °C until use. RNA from alveolar macrophages of nonsmokers and active smokers was reverse transcribed with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (ABI) using Megaplex Primers version 2.0 (ABI). Changes in miRNA expression were then determined using human TaqMan Low Density Arrays version 2.0 (ABI). Ct values calculated using SDS version 2.4 (ABI) were exported to the Partek Genomics Suite to calculate smoker-to-nonsmoker expression ratios. Robust multiarray averaging (RMA)-normalized data were subjected to an analysis of variance model with linear contrasts to calculate p values. Individual miRNA-specific assays were done using ABI kits specific for the mature miRNA or for the primary transcript (before processing). Genome-wide macrophage mRNA expression was obtained using the GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix). Generation of labeled cDNA, hybridizations, and scanning of the microarray were performed under contract by the University of Iowa DNA facility. The resulting data were analyzed using the Partek Genomics Suite version 6.5 (Partek). The data were assessed for quality and subjected to RMA normalization. The normalized data were then analyzed using an analysis of variance model with linear contrasts to calculate p values and smoker/nonsmoker expression ratios. The false discovery rate step-up method (26.Benjamini Y. Krieger A. Yekutieli D. Adaptive linear step-up procedures that control the false discovery rate.Biometrika. 2006; 93: 491-507Crossref Scopus (1615) Google Scholar) was applied to correct for multiple testing. The expression data have been deposited in the NCBI GEO repository (accession number GSE34517). To generate the data shown in Fig. 3E, we mined RNA array data performed on alveolar macrophages from 43 nonsmokers and 42 smokers. The log 2 values obtained by the initial Partek analysis for the gene DICER are shown in an individual value plot. Possible significance between the two groups was assessed by Student's t test. Whole cell protein was obtained by lysing the cells on ice for 20 min in 200 μl of lysis buffer (0.05 m Tris, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 with added protease and phosphatase inhibitors: 1 protease Minitab (Roche Applied Science)/10 ml and 100 μl of 100× phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem)/10 ml. The lysates were sonicated for 20 s, kept at 4 ºC for 30 min, and spun at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was saved. Protein determinations were made using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates were stored at −70° until use. Whole cell protein was obtained as described previously (27.Philibert R.A. Sears R.A. Powers L.S. Nash E. Bair T. Gerke A.K. Hassan I. Thomas C.P. Gross T.J. Monick M.M.

Biol. 2012; 92: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Following protein purification, Western analysis was performed following protocols as described by Reisetter et al. (16.Reisetter A.C. Stebounova L.V. Baltrusaitis J. Powers L. Gupta A. Grassian V.H. Monick M.M. Induction of inflammasome-dependent pyroptosis by carbon black nanoparticles.J. Biol.

The following antibodies were used: anti-HA, Roche Applied Science, catalog no. 11867423001; anti-DICER, Abcam, catalog no. ab14601; anti-PACT, Abcam, catalog no. ab75749; anti-TRBP, Abcam, catalog no. ab42018; anti-β-actin, Abcam, catalog no. ab8226; anti-UBC9, Abcam, catalog no. ab21193; anti-SUMO 2/3, Abcam, catalog no. ab3742; anti-ubiquitin, Cell Signaling, catalog no. 3936. Immunoprecipitation of DICER was performed on alveolar macrophages or THP-1 cells. Immunoprecipitation of cellular protein was performed using the protein G Dynabead immunoprecipitation kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoprecipitation was used in the protein modification assays and in the DICER activity assay. DICER was pulled down using an antibody to DICER (Abcam, catalog no. ab14601). An in vitro DICER activity assay was used to test the effect of smoking on DICER activity (28.Kim D.H. Behlke M.A. Rose S.D. Chang M.S. Choi S. Rossi J.J. Synthetic dsRNA Dicer substrates enhance RNAi potency and efficacy.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell protein extracts were adjusted to 1 mg/ml and 25 μl of the lysate incubated with 125 pmol of a 27-mer RNA duplex DICER substrate (DsiRNAs, IDT) and incubated at 37 °C for 8 h. To evaluate the conversion of 27-mer dsRNA substrate to 21-mer dsRNA product, 2.5 μl of extract postincubation was resolved on a 3.5–20% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized with SYBR Green fluorescent dye. DICER activity was calculated based on the percentage of 27-mer converted to a 21-mer RNA strand. The fluorescent image from a Bio-Rad VersaDoc imaging system was converted to a tiff file and analyzed for pixels per band using ImageJ, a public domain Java image-processing program inspired by NIH Image (National Institutes of Health). To measure DICER activity within cells, vectors were made expressing pre-miRNAs for two of the highly smoking-altered miRNAs (miR-146b and miR-708). HeLa cells were transfected with the pre-miRNA constructs, and expression was allowed to proceed overnight. Cells were then exposed to CSE for a short time (1 and 3 h, chosen to show DICER altered but not depleted), and RNA was harvested. Generation of mature miRs was determined by both qRT-PCR and Northern analysis. Primers for the H1 promoter that included sequence for the pre-miR of interest were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). These included H1 promoter forward primer (5′-ccatggaattcgaacgctgacg-3′) and reverse primers for either miR-146b (5′-aaaactcgagaaaaaacagaactgagtccacagggcattgctagagctcacagcctatggaattcagttctcagggaaagagtggtctcagacagaac-3′) or miR-708 (3′-aaaactcgagaaaaaactagaagctcacagtctagttgtgttcatgtgcaagtcatttacccccagctagattgtaagctccttgggaaagagtggtctcagacagaac-3′). PCR was performed using the H1 plasmid as a substrate (as described previously (29.Boudreau R.L. Martins I. Davidson B.L. Artificial miRNAs as siRNA shuttles: improved safety as compared to shRNAs in vitro and in vivo.Mol. Ther. 2009; 17: 169-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The resulting product (H1 promoter followed by the specific pre-miR) was cloned into a TOPO cloning vector (pCR 4-TOPO TA cloning vector) using the manufacturer's protocol. Kanamycin/ampicillin-resistant clones were selected and amplified, and DNA was isolated. Selected clones were grown and sequenced to verify the insert. Isolated RNA was run on a 12% polyacrylamide gel (19:1 bis/7 m urea) in 0.5× TBE. The gel was blotted onto Hybond N+ membrane and probed with a 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide designed to bind both the mature miR and pre-miRNA sequence (miR-146b, 5′-GAGCCTATGGAATTCAGTTCTCA and 3′GC AGAACTGAGTCCACTGGGCA; miR-708, 5′-GAGCCTATGGAATTCAGTTCTCA and 3′-GCCAGAACTGAGTCCACAGGGCA). For both miR146b and miR-708, the 5′ arm of the duplex produces the major mature product. The 3′ probes were used as a control. Blots were hybridized overnight and washed, and images were obtained with x-ray film. Control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. 44230) or target-specific 19–25-nucleotide siRNA designed to knock down Ubc9 was transfected into HeLa cells at a final concentration of 50 nm using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfection mixtures were assembled as described previously (30.Manzel L.J. Chin C.L. Behlke M.A. Look D.C. Regulation of bacteria-induced intercellular adhesion molecule-1 by CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins.Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2009; 40: 200-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 200 μl of transfection mixture and 2 ml of antibiotic-free medium for 16–18 h. Transfection efficiency was assessed by using a fluorescent control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog no. 36869). Knockdown of Ubc9 was confirmed with Western blotting. A glutathione assay was performed on whole cell lysates using the GSH-Glo glutathione Assay from Promega (catalog no. V6911) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unpaired Student's t test and one-way analysis of variance were used to determine significance between experimental groups. Data are presented as means ± S.E. The program used for data analysis was GraphPad Prism version 5.00 (San Diego, CA). Our laboratory has previously shown that smokers' alveolar macrophages are characterized by a decrease in expression of a wide variety of miRNAs (10.Graff J.W. Powers L.S. Dickson A.M. Kim J.

In Fig. 1A, we show an analysis of the changes in miRNA that are linked to mRNA changes between nonsmoker and smoker alveolar macrophages. These values were extracted from the larger data set reported previously (10.Graff J.W. Powers L.S. Dickson A.M. Kim J. Reisetter A.C. Hassan I.H. Kremens K. Gross T.J. Wilson M.E. Monick M.M. Cigarette smoking decreases global miRNA expression in human alveolar macrophages.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e44066Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The data for this figure were generated from lists of altered miRNAs (>2-fold change) and their potential targets (determined by Target Scan and TarBase) and significantly altered mRNAs (q ≤ 0.10) (Gene Chip Human Exon Array 1.0 ST arrays). The q value (false discovery rate) for the mRNAs was calculated using the Partek GS implementation of the step-up method. Gene IDs common to both lists (miRNA targets and mRNAs) were plotted. Each dot represents a gene/miRNA pair as predicted by Target Scan and/or TarBase. Of particular note are the gene/miRNA pairs identified in the top left and bottom right quadrants (Fig. 1A). The top left (more mRNA and less linked miRNA) and bottom right (less mRNA and more linked miRNA) quadrants demonstrate multiple reciprocal relationships between miRNA changes and mRNA changes with smoking. Some of the genes included in the top left quadrant of this figure include MMP12, a matrix metalloproteinase linked to emphysema; SPRY2, a possible regulator of the DICER complex; SPARC, a regulator of extracellular matrix; and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the first rate-limiting enzyme in glutathione synthesis. The data were significant both in the consistency of the changes caused by smoking and by the presence of smoking-linked changes in genes involved in disease (i.e. MMP12, other matrix-related genes, inflammatory genes, and angiogenesis factors) (4.Tetley T.D.

In order to dissect the mechanism underlying this significant decrease in expression of miRNAs, we selected eight miRNAs that were significantly down-regulated in our published data set (miR-708, miR-200a, miR-210, miR-187, miR-149, miR-429, miR-146b-3p, and miR-200c) (10.Graff J.W.

Due to sampling constraints at depths below 700 m duplicate samples were not collected. The microbial communities of L. diversichela, P. compressa and I. pellicula were typical of low microbial abundance (LMA) sponges while S. normani had a community more typical of high microbial abundance (HMA) sponges. Analysis of the deep sea sponge microbiota revealed that the three LMA-like sponges shared a set of abundant OTUs that were distinct from those associated with sponges from shallow waters. Comparison of the pyrosequencing data with that from shallow water sponges revealed that the microbial communities of all sponges analysed have similar archaeal populations but that the bacterial populations of the deep sea sponges were distinct. Further analysis of the common and abundant OTUs from the three LMA-like sponges placed them within the groups of ammonia oxidising Archaea (Thaumarchaeota) and sulphur oxidising γ-Proteobacteria (Chromatiales). Reads from these two groups made up over 70% of all 16S rRNA genes detected from the three LMA-like sponge samples, providing evidence of a putative common microbial assemblage associated with deep sea LMA sponges."
https://openalex.org/W2086376975,"Background Minimum unit pricing of alcohol is a novel public health policy with the potential to improve population health and reduce health inequalities. Theories of the policy process may help to understand the development of policy innovation and in turn identify lessons for future public health research and practice. This study aims to explain minimum unit pricing’s development by taking a ‘multiple-lenses’ approach to understanding the policy process. In particular, we apply three perspectives of the policy process (Kingdon’s multiple streams, Punctuated-Equilibrium Theory, Multi-Level Governance) to understand how and why minimum unit pricing has developed in Scotland and describe implications for efforts to develop evidence-informed policymaking. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with policy actors (politicians, civil servants, academics, advocates, industry representatives) involved in the development of MUP (n = 36). Interviewees were asked about the policy process and the role of evidence in policy development. Data from two other sources (a review of policy documents and an analysis of evidence submission documents to the Scottish Parliament) were used for triangulation. Findings The three perspectives provide complementary understandings of the policy process. Evidence has played an important role in presenting the policy issue of alcohol as a problem requiring action. Scotland-specific data and a change in the policy ‘image’ to a population-based problem contributed to making alcohol-related harms a priority for action. The limited powers of Scottish Government help explain the type of price intervention pursued while distinct aspects of the Scottish political climate favoured the pursuit of price-based interventions. Conclusions Evidence has played a crucial but complex role in the development of an innovative policy. Utilising different political science theories helps explain different aspects of the policy process, with Multi-Level Governance particularly useful for highlighting important lessons for the future of public health policy."
https://openalex.org/W2166366276,"Platelet-derived SDF-1α (CXCL12) mediates inflammatory and regenerative mechanisms. The present study characterizes the effect of SDF-1α ligation in platelets. SDF-1α (0–100 μM) dose and time dependently caused internalization of its receptor CXCR4 (28.9±1.6 vs. 16.1±1.9 in SDF-1α-treated platelets), coupled to the surface externalization of CXCR7 (65.5±8 vs. 162.8±27.6 following SDF-1α treatment), both in vitro and in vivo. This was inhibited in the presence of AMD3100 (100 μM), CXCR4 blocking and vesicular transport inhibitors (brefeldin A, 10 μM; rapamycin, 100 nM). SDF-1α/CXCR-4-mediated CXCR7 translocation was significantly reduced by inhibitors of ERK1/2-(U0126-10 μM) and cyclophilinA (CyPA)-(NIM811-10 μM) by 28 and 46%, respectively. Further, SDF-1α-induced downstream phosphorylation of Erk1/2 led to CyPA-dependent ubiquitination of CXCR7, which is essential for its surface translocation. CyPA-PPIase-activity inhibitor NIM-811, Erk1/2, and E1-ligase inhibitor-(PYR-41-25 μM) significantly abolished SDF-1α-driven CXCR7 ubiquitination and subsequent surface translocation. SDF-1α induced CXCR7 ubiquitination, and its surface exposure was observed in wild-type murine platelets, but not in CyPA-deficient platelets. SDF-1α/CXCR4-CyPA-dependent CXCR7 translocation and its subsequent ligation attenuated activation-induced apoptosis both in vitro and when administered in vivo. This antiapoptotic effect of SDF-1α was abrogated by blocking CXCR7, also significantly affected in Cypa–/– platelets. Thus, we decipher a novel mechanism, whereby SDF-1α regulates relative receptor availability in circulating platelets and exerts its prosurvival benefits.—Chatterjee, M., Seizer, P., Borst, O., Schönberger, T., Mack, A., Geisler, T., Langer, H.

https://openalex.org/W2068684706,"Protrudin is a membrane protein that regulates polarized vesicular trafficking in neurons. The protrudin gene (ZFYVE27) is mutated in a subset of individuals with hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and protrudin is therefore also referred to as spastic paraplegia (SPG) 33. We have now generated mice that express a transgene for dual epitope-tagged protrudin under control of a neuron-specific promoter, and we have subjected highly purified protrudin-containing complexes isolated from the brain of these mice to proteomics analysis to identify proteins that associate with protrudin. Protrudin was found to interact with other HSP-related proteins including myelin proteolipid protein 1 (SPG2), atlastin-1 (SPG3A), REEP1 (SPG31), REEP5 (similar to REEP1), Kif5A (SPG10), Kif5B, Kif5C, and reticulon 1, 3, and 4 (similar to reticulon 2, SPG12). Membrane topology analysis indicated that one of three hydrophobic segments of protrudin forms a hydrophobic hairpin domain similar to those of other SPG proteins. Protrudin was found to localize predominantly to the tubular endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and forced expression of protrudin promoted the formation and stabilization of the tubular ER network. The protrudin(G191V) mutant, which has been identified in a subset of HSP patients, manifested an increased intracellular stability, and cells expressing this mutant showed an increased susceptibility to ER stress. Our results thus suggest that protrudin contributes to the regulation of ER morphology and function, and that its deregulation by mutation is a causative defect in HSP."

We have developed a global phospho-proteomic workflow to determine activity of signaling pathways and drug targets in pancreatic cancer tissue for clinical application.Peptides resulting from tryptic digestion of proteins extracted from frozen tissue of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and background pancreas (n = 12), were labelled with tandem mass tags (TMT 8-plex), separated by strong cation exchange chromatography, then were analysed by LC-MS/MS directly or first enriched for phosphopeptides using IMAC and TiO2, prior to analysis. In-house, commercial and freeware bioinformatic platforms were used to identify relevant biological events from the complex dataset.Of 2,101 proteins identified, 152 demonstrated significant difference in abundance between tumor and non-tumor tissue. They included proteins that are known to be up-regulated in pancreatic cancer (e.g. Mucin-1), but the majority were new candidate markers such as HIPK1 & MLCK. Of the 6,543 unique phosphopeptides identified (6,284 unique phosphorylation sites), 635 showed significant regulation, particularly those from proteins involved in cell migration (Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors & MRCKα) and formation of focal adhesions. Activator phosphorylation sites on FYN, AKT1, ERK2, HDAC1 and other drug targets were found to be highly modulated (≥2 fold) in different cases highlighting their predictive power.Here we provided critical information enabling us to identify the common and unique molecular events likely contributing to cancer in each case.

Although persons with Alzheimer’s disease have lower cortical levels of BDNF, evidence regarding the association between circulating BDNF and cognitive function is conflicting. We sought to determine the correlates of BDNF level and whether BDNF level was prospectively associated with cognitive decline in healthy older adults. We measured serum BDNF near baseline in 912 individuals. Cognitive status was assessed repeatedly with the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination and the Digit Symbol Substitution test over the next 10 years. We evaluated the association between BDNF and cognitive decline with longitudinal models. We also assessed the association between BDNF level and demographics, comorbidities and health behaviors. We found an association between serum BDNF and several characteristics that are also associated with dementia (race and depression), suggesting that future studies should control for these potential confounders. We did not find evidence of a longitudinal association between serum BDNF and subsequent cognitive test trajectories in older adults, although we did identify a potential trend toward a cross-sectional association. Our results suggest that serum BDNF may have limited utility as a biomarker of prospective cognitive decline."
https://openalex.org/W1986568390,"The 26 S proteasome is responsible for regulated proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. It is composed of one 20 S core particle (CP) flanked by one or two 19 S regulatory particles. The CP is composed of seven different α-type subunits (α1-α7) and seven different β-type subunits, three of which are catalytic. Vertebrates encode four additional catalytic β subunits that are expressed predominantly in immune tissues and produce distinct subtypes of CPs particularly well suited for the acquired immune system. In contrast, the diversity of α subunits remains poorly understood. Recently, another α subunit, referred to as α4s, was reported. However, little is known about α4s. Here we provide a detailed characterization of α4s and the α4s-containing CP. α4s is exclusively expressed in germ cells that enter the meiotic prophase and is incorporated into the CP in place of α4. A comparison of structural models revealed that the differences in the primary sequences between α4 and α4s are located on the outer surface of the CP, suggesting that α4s interacts with specific molecules via these unique regions. α4s-containing CPs account for the majority of the CPs in mouse sperm. The catalytic β subunits in the α4s-containing CP are β1, β2, and β5, and immunosubunits are not included in the α4s-containing CP. α4s-containing CPs have a set of peptidase activities almost identical to those of α4-containing CPs. Our results provide a basis for understanding the role of α4s and male germ cell-specific proteasomes in mammals."

This is the first report of a mesonivirus in Australia, which extends the geographical range of this virus family to 3 continents. The virus was isolated in 2010 from Coquillettidia xanthogaster mosquitoes during surveillance in the suburbs of Darwin, the capital of the Northern Territory. Cryo-electron microscopy of the CASV virions revealed spherical particles of 65 nm in size with large club-shaped projections of approximately 15 nm in length. The new virus was most closely related to Alphamesonivirus 1, the only currently recognized species in the family. In 2013 a further 5 putative new mesonivirus species were described: Hana, Méno, Nsé, Moumo and Dak Nong viruses. The evolutionary distance between CASV and two of its closest relatives, Cavally and Hana viruses (Jones-Taylor-Thornton distance of 0.151 and 0.224, respectively), along with its isolation from a different genus of mosquitoes captured on a separate continent indicate that CASV is a new species."
https://openalex.org/W2007987786,"Aflatoxins, carcinogenic toxins produced by Aspergillus fungi, contaminate maize, peanuts, and tree nuts in many regions of the world. Pistachios are the main source of human dietary aflatoxins from tree nuts worldwide. Over 120 countries have regulations for maximum allowable aflatoxin levels in food commodities. We developed social network models to analyze the association between nations' aflatoxin regulations and global trade patterns of pistachios from 1996-2010. The main pistachio producing countries are Iran and the United States (US), which together contribute to nearly 75% of the total global pistachio market. Over this time period, during which many nations developed or changed their aflatoxin regulations in pistachios, global pistachio trade patterns changed; with the US increasingly exporting to countries with stricter aflatoxin standards. The US pistachio crop has had consistently lower levels of aflatoxin than the Iranian crop over this same time period. As similar trading patterns have also been documented in maize, public health may be affected if countries without aflatoxin regulations, or with more relaxed regulations, continually import crops with higher aflatoxin contamination. Unlike the previous studies on maize, this analysis includes a dynamic element, examining how trade patterns change over time with introduction or adjustment of aflatoxin regulations."
https://openalex.org/W2065822074,"Short-chain aliphatic esters are small volatile molecules that produce fruity and pleasant aromas and flavors. Most of these esters are artificially produced or extracted from natural sources at high cost. It is, however, possible to ‘naturally’ produce these molecules using biocatalysts such as lipases and esterases. A gene coding for a newly uncovered lipase was isolated from a previous metagenomic study and cloned into E. coli BL21 (DE3) for overexpression using the pET16b plasmid. Using this recombinant strain as a whole-cell biocatalyst, short chain esters were efficiently synthesized by transesterification and esterification reactions in organic media. The recombinant lipase (LipIAF5-2) showed good affinity toward glyceryl trioctanoate and the highest conversion yields were obtained for the transesterification of glyceryl triacetate with methanol. Using a simple cetyl-trimethylammonium bromide pretreatment increased the synthetic activity by a six-fold factor and the whole-cell biocatalyst showed the highest activity at 40°C with a relatively high water content of 10% (w/w). The whole-cell biocatalyst showed excellent tolerance to alcohol and short-chain fatty acid denaturation. Substrate affinity was equally effective with all primary alcohols tested as acyl acceptors, with a slight preference for methanol. The best transesterification conversion of 50 mmol glyceryl triacetate into isoamyl acetate (banana fragrance) provided near 100% yield after 24 hours using 10% biocatalyst loading (w/w) in a fluidized bed reactor, allowing recycling of the biocatalyst up to five times. These results show promising potential for an industrial approach aimed at the biosynthesis of short-chain esters, namely for natural flavor and fragrance production in micro-aqueous media."

However, these interactions are not sufficient to maintain the Z-disc structure. We show that ZASP directly interacts with skeletal actin filaments. The actin-binding domain is between the modular PDZ and LIM domains. This ZASP region is alternatively spliced so that each isoform has unique actin-binding domains. All ZASP isoforms contain the exon 6-encoded ZASP-like motif that is mutated in zaspopathy, a myofibrillar myopathy (MFM), whereas the exon 8–11 junction-encoded peptide is exclusive to the postnatal long ZASP isoform (ZASP-LΔex10). MFM is characterized by disruption of skeletal muscle Z-discs and accumulation of myofibrillar degradation products. Wild-type and mutant ZASP interact with α-actin, α-actinin, and myotilin.

https://openalex.org/W2108444196,"Climate warming is one of the most important threats to biodiversity. Ectothermic organisms such as amphibians and reptiles are especially vulnerable as climatic conditions affect them directly. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are increasingly popular in ecological studies, but several drawbacks exist, including the limited ability to account for the dispersal potential of the species. In this study, we use ENMs to explore the impact of global climate change on the Caspian whip snake (Dolichophis caspius) as model for organisms with low dispersal abilities and to quantify dispersal to novel areas using GIS techniques. Models generated using Maxent 3.3.3 k and GARP for current distribution were projected on future climatic scenarios. A cost-distance analysis was run in ArcGIS 10 using geomorphological features, ecological conditions, and human footprint as “costs” to dispersal of the species to obtain a Maximum Dispersal Range (MDR) estimate. All models developed were statistically significant (P<0.05) and recovered the currently known distribution of D. caspius. Models projected on future climatic conditions using Maxent predicted a doubling of suitable climatic area, while GARP predicted a more conservative expansion. Both models agreed on an expansion of suitable area northwards, with minor decreases at the southern distribution limit. The MDR area calculated using the Maxent model represented a third of the total area of the projected model. The MDR based on GARP models recovered only about 20% of the total area of the projected model. Thus, incorporating measures of species’ dispersal abilities greatly reduced estimated area of potential future distributions."

https://openalex.org/W2050634275,"Cerebral ischemia frequently leads to long-term disability and death. Excitotoxicity is believed to be the main cause for ischemia-induced neuronal death. Although a role of glutamate receptors in this process has been firmly established, the contribution of metabotropic GABAB receptors, which control excitatory neurotransmission, is less clear. A prominent characteristic of ischemic insults is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress associated with the up-regulation of the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-homologous protein (CHOP). After inducing ER stress in cultured cortical neurons by sustained Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores or by a brief episode of oxygen and glucose deprivation (in vitro model of cerebral ischemia), we observed an increased expression of CHOP accompanied by a strong reduction of cell surface GABAB receptors. Our results indicate that down-regulation of cell surface GABAB receptors is caused by the interaction of the receptors with CHOP in the ER. Binding of CHOP prevented heterodimerization of the receptor subunits GABAB1 and GABAB2 and subsequent forward trafficking of the receptors to the cell surface. The reduced level of cell surface receptors diminished GABAB receptor signaling and, thus, neuronal inhibition. These findings indicate that ischemia-mediated up-regulation of CHOP down-regulates cell surface GABAB receptors by preventing their trafficking from the ER to the plasma membrane. This mechanism leads to diminished neuronal inhibition and may contribute to excitotoxicity in cerebral ischemia."

It is generally considered to be robust and convenient since it measures DNA rather than RNA. In the current study, we combine copy number estimates from four different platforms (Agilent 44 K, NimbleGen 385 K, Affymetrix 500 K and Illumina Human1Mv1_C) to compute a reliable, high-resolution, easy to understand output for the measure of copy number changes in the 60 cancer cells of the NCI-DTP (the NCI-60). We then relate the results to gene expression. We explain how to access that database using our CellMiner web-tool and provide an example of the ease of comparison with transcript expression, whole exome sequencing, microRNA expression and response to 20,000 drugs and other chemical compounds. We then demonstrate how the data can be analyzed integratively with transcript expression data for the whole genome (26,065 genes). Comparison of copy number and expression levels shows an overall medium high correlation (median r = 0.247), with significantly higher correlations (median r = 0.408) for the known tumor suppressor genes. That observation is consistent with the hypothesis that gene loss is an important mechanism for tumor suppressor inactivation. An integrated analysis of concurrent DNA copy number and gene expression change is presented. Limiting attention to focal DNA gains or losses, we identify and reveal novel candidate tumor suppressors with matching alterations in transcript level."
https://openalex.org/W2034980077,"Glucocorticoids are important mediators of the stress response and are commonly employed as drugs for the suppression of immune rejection after organ transplantation. Previous investigations uncovered the possibility of mood depression in patients undergoing long-term treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids, including dexamethasone (DEX). Exogenous glucocorticoids and their synthetic derivatives can also adversely affect the development of the central nervous system. Although neurite extension from rat pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells and a variety of primary neurons is stimulated by nerve growth factor (NGF), and signaling pathways triggered by the binding of NGF to tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA) function in both neurite outgrowth and neuronal survival, the effect of DEX on the activation of regulatory proteins and pathways downstream of TrkA has not been well characterized. To analyze the influence of DEX on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and signaling, PC12 cells, a widely utilized model of neuronal differentiation, were pretreated with the glucocorticoid prior to NGF induction. NGF-induced neurite outgrowth was attenuated by pretreatment with DEX, even in the absence of DEX after the addition of NGF. Moreover, DEX suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in the neurite outgrowth signaling cascade initiated by NGF. Finally, the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, RU38486, counteracted the inhibitory effect of DEX pretreatment, not only on the phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2, but also on neurite extension from PC12 cells. These results suggest that DEX binding to the GR impairs NGF-promoted neurite outgrowth by interfering with the activation/phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2. These novel findings are likely to be useful for elucidating the central nervous system depressive mechanism(s) of action of DEX and other glucocorticoids."

Tie2-CYP4F2-Tr ECs demonstrated increases in growth (267.1±33.4 vs. 205.0±13% at 48 h) and tube formation (7.7±1.1 vs. 1.6±0.5 tubes/field) that were 20-HETE dependent and associated with up-regulation of prooxidant NADPH oxidase and proangiogenic VEGF. Increases in VEGF and NADPH oxidase levels were abrogated by inhibitors of NADPH oxidase and MAPK, respectively, suggesting the possibility of crosstalk between pathways. Interestingly, IL-6 levels in Tie2-CYP4F2-Tr mice (18.6±2.7 vs. 7.9±2.7 pg/ml) were up-regulated via NADPH oxidase- and 20-HETE-dependent mechanisms. Although Tie2-CYP4F2-Tr aortas displayed increased vasoconstriction, vasorelaxation and blood pressure were unchanged. Our findings indicate that human CYP4F2 significantly increases 20-HETE production, CYP4F2-derived 20-HETE mediates EC proliferation and angiogenesis via VEGF- and NADPH oxidase-dependent manners, and the Tie2-CYP4F2-Tr mouse is a novel model for examining the pathophysiological effects of CYP4F2-derived 20-HETE in the vasculature.—Cheng, J., Edin, M.

https://openalex.org/W2147633142,"A defining feature in proliferative retinopathies is the formation of pathological neovessels. In these diseases, the balance between neovessel formation and regression determines blindness, making the modulation of neovessel growth highly desirable. The role of the immune system in these retinopathies is of increasing interest, but it is not completely understood. We investigated the role of the alternative complement pathway during the formation and resolution of aberrant neovascularization. We used alternative complement pathway-deficient (Fb(-/-)) mice and age- and strain-matched control mice to assess neovessel development and regression in an oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model. In the control mice, we found increased transcription of Fb after OIR treatment. In the Fb(-/-) mice, we prepared retinal flatmounts and identified an increased number of neovessels, peaking at postnatal day 17 (P17; P=0.001). Subjecting human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to low oxygen, mimicking a characteristic of neovessels, decreased the expression of the complement inhibitor Cd55. Finally, using laser capture microdissection (LCM) to isolate the neovessels after OIR, we found decreased expression of Cd55 (P=0.005). Together, our data implicate the alternative complement pathway in facilitating neovessel clearance by down-regulating the complement inhibitor Cd55 specifically on neovessels, allowing for their targeted removal while leaving the established vasculature intact.-Sweigard, J.

https://openalex.org/W2075758526,"Peptidylglycine α-hydroxylating monooxygenase is a noninteracting bicopper enzyme that stereospecifically hydroxylates the terminal glycine of small peptides for its later amidation. Neuroendocrine messengers, such as oxytocin, rely on the biological activity of this enzyme. Each catalytic turnover requires one oxygen molecule, two protons from the solvent, and two electrons. Despite this enzyme having been widely studied, a consensus on the reaction mechanism has not yet been found. Experiments and theoretical studies favor a pro-S abstraction of a hydrogen atom followed by the rebinding of an OH group. However, several hydrogen-abstracting species have been postulated; because two protons are consumed during the reaction, several protonation states are available. An electron transfer between the copper atoms could play a crucial role for the catalysis as well. This leads to six possible abstracting species. In this study, we compare them on equal footing. We perform quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, considering the glycine hydrogen abstraction. Our results suggest that the most likely mechanism is a protonation of the abstracting species before the hydrogen abstraction and another protonation as well as a reduction before OH rebinding."
https://openalex.org/W2053376267,"The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) mediates and gates the flux of metabolites and ions across the outer mitochondrial membrane and is a key player in cellular metabolism and apoptosis. Here we characterized the binding of nucleotides to human VDAC1 (hVDAC1) on a single-residue level using NMR spectroscopy and site-directed mutagenesis. We find that hVDAC1 possesses one major binding region for ATP, UTP, and GTP that partially overlaps with a previously determined NADH binding site. This nucleotide binding region is formed by the N-terminal α-helix, the linker connecting the helix to the first β-strand and adjacent barrel residues. hVDAC1 preferentially binds the charged forms of ATP, providing support for a mechanism of metabolite transport in which direct binding to the charged form exerts selectivity while at the same time permeation of the Mg(2+)-complexed ATP form is possible."

Similarly, we sought to investigate which domains within EndoS could contribute to activity. Bioinformatics analysis of the domain organization of EndoS confirmed the previous predictions of a chitinase domain and leucine-rich repeat but also revealed a putative carbohydrate binding module (CBM) followed by a C-terminal region. Using expressed fragments of EndoS, circular dichroism of the isolated CBM, and a CBM-C-terminal region fusion revealed folded domains dominated by β sheet and α helical structure, respectively. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the CBM with monosaccharides was suggestive of carbohydrate binding functionality.

https://openalex.org/W2116475024,"iASPP is a member of the apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53 (ASPP) family and negatively regulates the apoptotic function of p53. In a hematopoietic system, overexpression of iASPP results in blockage of apoptosis, which may play a role in regulating hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) numbers. To address this, we first analyzed the expression of iASPP in patients with acute leukemia (AL) and found it was highly expressed in patients with AL. We further established a transgenic mouse model in which human iASPP was specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells. Overexpression of iASPP led to an increase in the proportion of long-term HSCs, short-term HSCs, multipotent progenitors, and common myeloid progenitor. HSCs from iASPP transgenic mice had an advantage in long-term reconstitution potential. In addition, the hematopoietic cells from iASPP transgenic mice exhibited a significantly lower level of p53 dependent apoptosis. After irradiation damage, hematopoietic cells of iASPP transgenic mice had a higher level of γ-H2AX expression, which lasted for a longer time. These results provide the first evidence that the iASPP can increase HSC populations and reconstitution capacity. Interestingly, in response to cell damage stimuli, hematopoietic cells can be protected against apoptosis by iASPP; meanwhile these apoptosis-resistant cells would have more mutation accumulation, which might be the potential risk for malignant transformation.—Jia, Y., Peng, L., Rao, Q., Xing, H., Huai, L., Yu, P., Chen, Y., Wang, C., Wang, M., Mi, Y., Wang, J.

https://openalex.org/W2036516610,"The eusocial termites are well accomplished in chemical communication, but how they achieve the communication using trace amount of no more than two pheromone components is mostly unknown. In this study, the foraging process and trail pheromones of the fungus-growing termite Odontotermes formosanus (Shiraki) were systematically studied and monitored in real-time using a combination of techniques, including video analysis, solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography coupled with either mass spectrometry or an electroantennographic detector, and bioassays. The trail pheromone components in foraging workers were (3Z)-dodec-3-en-1-ol and (3Z,6Z)-dodeca-3,6-dien-1-ol secreted by their sternal glands. Interestingly, ratio of the two components changed according to the behaviors that the termites were displaying. This situation only occurs in termites whereas ratios of pheromone components are fixed and species-specific for other insect cuticular glands. Moreover, in bioassays, the active thresholds of the two components ranged from 1 fg/cm to 10 pg/cm according to the behavioral contexts or the pheromonal exposure of tested workers. The two components did not act in synergy. (3Z)-Dodec-3-en-1-ol induced orientation behavior of termites that explore their environment, whereas (3Z,6Z)-dodeca-3,6-dien-1-ol had both an orientation effect and a recruitment effect when food was discovered. The trail pheromone of O. formosanus was regulated both quantitatively by the increasing number of workers involved in the early phases of foraging process, and qualitatively by the change in ratio of the two pheromone components on sternal glandular cuticle in the food-collecting workers. In bioassays, the responses of workers to the pheromone were also affected by the variation in pheromone concentration and component ratio in the microenvironment. Thus, this termite could exchange more information with nestmates using the traces of the two trail pheromone components that can be easily regulated within a limited microenvironment formed by the tunnels or chambers."

Pol β is mutated in a large number of colorectal tumors, and these mutations may drive carcinogenesis. In the present study, we wished to determine whether the S229L somatic Pol β variant identified in a stage 3 colorectal tumor is a driver of carcinogenesis. We show that S229L does not possess any defects in binding to either DNA or nucleotides compared with the WT enzyme, but exhibits a significant loss of polymerization efficiency, largely due to an 8-fold decrease in the polymerization rate. S229L participates in BER, but due to its lower catalytic rate, does so more slowly than WT.

After excision of the damaged base by a specific DNA glycosylase, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 cuts the DNA backbone 5′ to the abasic site, leaving a 3′-OH and a deoxyribose phosphate (5′-dRP) moiety. Some DNA glycosylases are bifunctional, removing the damaged base and incising the DNA backbone, abrogating the requirement for apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. Pol β is the major polymerase that fills the resulting single-nucleotide gap and removes the dRP group (5Prasad R. Beard W.A. Strauss P.R. Wilson S.H.

Our recent study identified 51 different nonsynonymous mutations in the POLB gene in a collection of 134 human colon tumors. The mutations were not clustered in any specific region of the protein and were located in all four subdomains. Some of these nonsynonymous mutations are likely a significant contributor to cancer progression because the mutations are selected for with many of the mutations being identified in late stage tumors, and there were no corresponding mutations identified in the normal matched tissues (6Donigan K.A.

In this study, we sought to determine whether the S229L variant identified in a stage 3 colorectal tumor could drive carcinogenesis. S229L is located in the palm domain and lies in close proximity to the DNA, but is not near the active site of the protein. We found that the expression of S229L in mammalian cells induces genomic instability and cellular transformation. Biochemically, S229L has a reduced catalytic rate compared with WT Pol β and impaired BER capacity. In combination, our results suggest that the S229L variant results in aberrant BER and that S229L can act as a driver of tumorigenesis. The S229L variant of Pol β was generated using the Stratagene QuikChange® Site-directed Mutagenesis kit according to manufacturer's instructions. pET28a rat WT Pol β containing a N-terminal His6 tag was used as a template for protein expression and biochemical studies. For cell culture experiments, the C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged rat WT Pol β in the pRVYTet retroviral vector was used as a template. The primers used for these reactions were purchased from Invitrogen, and the sequences are available upon request. Positive clones were confirmed by sequencing at the W. M.

All proteins were purified to >90% homogeneity as confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The final protein was aliquoted, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The final concentration was determined using the absorbance at 280 nm and the extinction coefficient for Pol β (ϵ = 21,200 m−1 cm−1). The DNA substrates used are shown in Table 1.

LPSD was used for the BER assay. All primers were radiolabeled at the 5′-end using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The downstream oligonucleotides were 5′-phosphorylated with nonradiolabeled ATP. The reactions were purified using Micro Bio-Spin® 30 Chromatography columns (Bio-Rad) to remove unincorporated ATP. The oligonucleotides were annealed by combining the radiolabeled primer, the nonradiolabeled downstream oligonucleotide, and the template in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.25 m NaCl.

Cell densities of 2.2 × 105 were plated in 60-mm dishes. After 48 h, cells were treated with varying concentrations of methylmethane sulfonate (MMS; Sigma-Aldrich). Following treatment, cells were trypsinized and plated at several dilutions. The cells were allowed to grow for 9–11 days and stained with crystal violet, and colonies were counted. Colonies were defined as having at least 50 cells. All experiments were performed at least three times. Equal number of cells (4 × 105) were plated in 60-mm dishes. The following day, the cells were left untreated or treated with 2 mm MMS for 30 min with or without a 30-min recovery. After treatment, the cells were prepared and analyzed immediately using Cometslides (Trevigen 4250-200-03) as described previously (14Yamtich J. Nemec A.A. Keh A. Sweasy J.B.

The cells were incubated with primary phospho-γH2AX antibody (Millipore 05-636) 1:500 overnight at 4 °C. Following the incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to FITC 1:500 for 1 h at room temperature.

Radiolabeled gapped DNA (50 nm 3C2M45) was incubated with WT Pol β (500 nm active sites) as was determined by active site titration experiments. For S229L Pol β, 500 nm protein was sufficient to bind 95% of DNA as was determined by EMSA. The DNA/Pol β mixture was incubated with varying concentrations of dNTP (5–2000 μm) as described previously (8Nemec A.A. Donigan K.A. Murphy D.L. Jaeger J. Sweasy J.B.

The concentration of extended product was plotted as a function of time, and the data were fit to a single-exponential curve to obtain the kobs for each dNTP concentration. A secondary plot of kobs for each dNTP concentration as a function of [dNTP] was fitted to a hyperbolic equationkobs=kpol[dNTP]kd(dNTP]+[dNTP](Eq. 3) where kpol is the rate of polymerization and Kd(dNTP) is the equilibrium dissociation constant for dNTP.

A replicate plate of each clone was counted every 24 h using an automated cell counter (Nexelcom) as described previously (11Donigan K.A. Hile S.E. Eckert K.A. Sweasy J.B.

Data were plotted as change in cell number/day (n = 3–4). Pol β+/+ MEFs expressing either WT or S229L Pol β were plated overnight in 10-cm dishes (106 cells/dish). Colcemid (Invitrogen) was added to the cells (0.1 μg/ml, 3 h) to arrest cells in mitosis. Cells were trypsinized, collected by centrifugation, washed once with PBS, and resuspended in a hypotonic solution (0.56% KCl) for 30 min at 37 °C to lyse the cells. The cells were fixed using Carnoy's fixative (75% methanol, 25% acetic acid) and dropped onto slides followed by staining with Giemsa, and well spread metaphases were identified under 100× objective (Zeiss). Images were taken using Spot Camera software (Diagnostic Instruments). Metaphase spreads were scored by eye for chromosomal fusions, breaks, and fragments. Scoring was performed blinded and validated by a second, independent person. Two-tailed t-tests and two-way analysis of variance were used as appropriate. Bonferroni's post hoc test was used to determine significant differences between the means of each group. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism version 5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and data are represented as mean ± S.E. of all replicates.

Pre-steady-state burst kinetics, using a 1-base pair gapped DNA substrate (Table 1), revealed that S229L does not display a biphasic burst that is typical of Pol β, suggesting that the kinetic pathway of S229L differs from that of WT (6Donigan K.A.

The rate-limiting step of WT Pol β is product release, and the lack of burst kinetics by S229L indicates that the rate-limiting step of the variant is chemistry or a step preceding chemistry. The decreased rate was not due to general changes in the structure or stability of the protein as both the global folding and melting temperature of the proteins were similar (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2S229L Pol β has the same overall structure and thermal stability as WT Pol β.

WT and S229L bound DNA with similar affinities (KD(DNA) = 4.1 ± 0.8 and 4.1 ± 0.3, respectively), indicating that DNA binding is not impaired and does not contribute to the DNA synthesis defect in S229L (Fig. 3 and Ref. 8Nemec A.A.

Chem. 2012; 287: 23840-23849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The rate of polymerization (kpol) and the apparent dNTP binding affinity (Kd(dNTP)) for both correct and incorrect nucleotides were determined using single turnover kinetics and the 3C2M45 DNA substrate (Fig. 4 and Table 1). These kinetic studies revealed that S229L binds both correct and incorrect dNTPs with affinity similar to that of WT (Table 2). However, there was a 4–5-fold reduction in the polymerization efficiency due to a decrease in the polymerization rate, kpol. This defect in polymerization accounts for the slowness of the S229L variant.FIGURE 4S229L Pol β has a lower polymerization rate than WT. A and C, representative plots show the incorporation of dCTP opposite G for WT (A) or S229L (C) at 37 °C. A preincubated solution containing 500 nm Pol β enzyme and 50 nm radiolabeled 3C2M45 DNA was combined with 10 mm MgCl2 and increasing concentrations of dCTP (0–1000 μm). Data were plotted as extended DNA formed versus time and fit to the single exponential equation to obtain the kobs for each dCTP concentration. B and D, secondary plots of the kobs versus dCTP concentration were fit to the hyperbolic equation to obtain kpol and Kd(dNTP) for WT (B) or S229L (D). Data are presented as mean ± S.E.

Open table in a new tab Next, we assessed the capacity of the S229L Pol β variant to participate in BER, given its slow catalytic rate in our biochemical experiments. The LPSD DNA substrate (Table 1) was incubated with UDG to excise the uracil, followed by incubation for 0–60 s with Pol β−/− MEF extract containing equally active amounts of purified WT or S229L Pol β enzyme. Although S229L was able to fill in the gap and remove the dRP group, forming an n+1 extended product, it did so at a slower rate than WT (Fig. 5, A and B). We subsequently performed clonogenic survival assays to assess whether S229L Pol β can participate in BER in vivo by expressing either WT or S229L in Pol β−/− MEFs. The data show that expression of S229L in Pol β−/− MEFs is able to rescue the cells from treatment with the alkylating agent MMS, but did not fully complement the BER defect of the Pol β-deficient MEFs compared with cells expressing WT Pol β (Fig. 5C). The lack of full complementation was not due to different levels of expression because Western blots showed that the two proteins are expressed at similar levels (Fig. 5D). To assess whether the slow rate of BER in S229L cells induced the accumulation of BER intermediates, we stably expressed either the S229L variant or WT in Pol β+/+ MEFs and performed an alkaline comet assay to quantify the amount of MMS-induced single-nucleotide gaps (SNGs) and single-strand breaks (SSBs). The Pol β+/+ MEF cell line was used because the S229L mutation is heterozygous and would normally be found with WT Pol β in a tumor. We used cells that expressed both WT and S229L Pol β at equivalent levels meaning that the cells exhibited 1:1 levels of exogenous to endogenous expression of Pol β (Fig. 5D). Following a 30-min treatment with MMS, S229L-expressing cells had a significant increase in SNGs/SSBs compared with WT cells. Moreover, even after allowing cells to recover for 30 min, cells expressing the S229L variant still had significant levels of SNGs/SSBs (Fig. 5E). These data suggest that cells expressing S229L do not efficiently fill in the SNG that is generated after removal of the alkylated"
https://openalex.org/W2039988316,"Autophagy is a highly regulated, energy dependent cellular process where proteins, organelles and cytoplasm are sequestered in autophagosomes and digested to sustain cellular homeostasis. We hypothesized that during autophagy induced in cancer cells by i) starvation through serum and amino acid deprivation or ii) treatment with PI-103, a class I PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, glycolytic metabolism would be affected, reducing flux to lactate, and that this effect may be reversible. We probed metabolism during autophagy in colorectal HT29 and HCT116 Bax knock-out cells using hyperpolarized (13)C-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and steady-state (1)H-MRS. 24 hr PI103-treatment or starvation caused significant reduction in the apparent forward rate constant (k(PL)) for pyruvate to lactate exchange compared with controls in HT29 (100 μM PI-103: 82%, p = 0.05) and HCT116 Bax-ko cells (10 μM PI-103: 53%, p = 0.05; 20 μM PI-103: 42%, p<0.0001; starvation: 52%, p<0.001), associated with reduced lactate excretion and intracellular lactate in all cases, and unchanged lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and increased NAD+/NADH ratio following PI103 treatment or decreased LDH activity and unchanged NAD+/NADH ratio following starvation. After 48 hr recovery from PI103 treatment, k(PL) remained below control levels in HT29 cells (74%, p = 0.02), and increased above treated values, but remained below 24 hr vehicle-treated control levels in HCT116 Bax-ko cells (65%, p = 0.004) both were accompanied by sustained reduction in lactate excretion, recovery of NAD+/NADH ratio and intracellular lactate. Following recovery from starvation, k(PL) was significantly higher than 24 hr vehicle-treated controls (140%, p = 0.05), associated with increased LDH activity and total cellular NAD(H). Changes in k(PL) and cellular and excreted lactate provided measureable indicators of the major metabolic processes accompanying starvation- and drug-induced autophagy. The changes are reversible, returning towards and exceeding control values on cellular recovery, which potentially identifies resistance. k(PL) (hyperpolarized (13)C-MRS) and lactate ((1)H-MRS) provide useful biomarkers for the autophagic process, enabling non-invasive monitoring of the Warburg effect."
https://openalex.org/W1970457027,"Refugia can affect predator-prey dynamics via movements between refuge and non-refuge areas. We examine the influence of a refuge on population dynamics in a large mammal predator-prey system. Wolves (Canis lupus) have recolonized much of their former range in North America, and as a result, ungulate prey have exploited refugia to reduce predation risk with unknown impacts on wolf-prey dynamics. We examined the influence of a refuge on elk (Cervus elaphus) and wolf population dynamics in Banff National Park. Elk occupy the Banff townsite with little predation, whereas elk in the adjoining Bow Valley experience higher wolf predation. The Banff refuge may influence Bow Valley predator-prey dynamics through source-sink movements. To test this hypothesis, we used 26 years of wolf and elk population counts and the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit five predator-prey models: 1) with no source-sink movements, 2) with elk density-dependent dispersal from the refuge to the non-refuge, 3) with elk predation risk avoidance movements from the non-refuge to the refuge, 4) with differential movement rates between refuge and non-refuge, and 5) with short-term, source-sink wolf movements. Model 1 provided the best fit of the data, as measured by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). In the top model, Banff and Bow Valley elk had median growth rates of 0.08 and 0.03 (95% credibility intervals [CIs]: 0.027-0.186 and 0.001-0.143), respectively, Banff had a median carrying capacity of 630 elk (95% CI: 471.9-2676.9), Bow Valley elk had a median wolf encounter rate of 0.02 (95% CI: 0.013-0.030), and wolves had a median death rate of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.146-0.335) and a median conversion efficiency of 0.07 (95% CI: 0.031-0.124). We found little evidence for potential source-sink movements influencing the predator-prey dynamics of this system. This result suggests that the refuge was isolated from the non-refuge."
https://openalex.org/W1985573232,"The early identification of children presenting ALKF1174L-mutated neuroblastoma, which are associated with resistance to the promising ALK inhibitor crizotinib and a marked poorer prognosis, has become a clinical priority. In comparing the radiology of the novel Th-ALKF1174L/Th-MYCN and the well-established Th-MYCN genetically-engineered murine models of neuroblastoma using MRI, we have identified a marked ALKF1174L-driven vascular phenotype. We demonstrate that quantitation of the transverse relaxation rate R2* (s−1) using intrinsic susceptibility-MRI under baseline conditions and during hyperoxia, can robustly discriminate this differential vascular phenotype, and identify MYCN-driven tumors harboring the ALKF1174L mutation with high specificity and selectivity. Intrinsic susceptibility-MRI could thus potentially provide a non-invasive and clinically-exploitable method to help identifying children with MYCN-driven neuroblastoma harboring the ALKF1174L mutation at the time of diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2075721978,"Background Maternal pre-pregnancy body-mass index (ppBMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) are associated with cardiometabolic risk (CMR) traits in the offspring. The extent to which maternal genetic variation accounts for these associations is unknown. Methods/Results In 1249 mother-offspring pairs recruited from the Jerusalem Perinatal Study, we used archival data to characterize ppBMI and GWG and follow-up data from offspring to assess CMR, including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, glucose, insulin, blood pressure, and lipid levels, at an average age of 32. Maternal genetic risk scores (GRS) were created using a subset of SNPs most predictive of ppBMI, GWG, and each CMR trait, selected among 1384 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) characterizing variation in 170 candidate genes potentially related to fetal development and/or metabolic risk. We fit linear regression models to examine the associations of ppBMI and GWG with CMR traits with and without adjustment for GRS. Compared to unadjusted models, the coefficient for the association of a one-standard-deviation (SD) difference in GWG and offspring BMI decreased by 41% (95%CI −81%, −11%) from 0.847 to 0.503 and the coefficient for a 1SD difference in GWG and WC decreased by 63% (95%CI −318%, −11%) from 1.196 to 0.443. For other traits, there were no statistically significant changes in the coefficients for GWG with adjustment for GRS. None of the associations of ppBMI with CMR traits were significantly altered by adjustment for GRS. Conclusions Maternal genetic variation may account in part for associations of GWG with offspring BMI and WC in young adults."
https://openalex.org/W2026457504,"Numerous aversive events occur in poultry production, and if repeated and unpredictable, can result in an impaired welfare. Some events such as handling can be perceived negatively and it is of interest to understand how humans' behaviour could affect poultry's behaviours and especially its avoidance of humans. Our aim was to evaluate short- and long-lasting effects of a 3-week procedure involving unpredictable repeated negative stimuli (URNS) applied during the post-juvenile period on quail's reactivity to humans. We compared the reactions of two sets of quail: URNS was applied to one set (treated quail) and the other set was left undisturbed (control quail). When two weeks old, treated quail were exposed to a variety of negative stimuli, either applied automatically or involving human presence. One and seven weeks after the termination of the procedure, the reactivity of control and treated quail to a passive human being was evaluated. Furthermore, the experimenter with her hand on a trough containing a mealworm assessed the propensity of quail of both groups to habituate to feed close to a human being. In the presence of a seated observer, treated quail were more inhibited and more alert than control quail. Likewise, seven weeks after the end of the URNS procedure, more treated than control quail adopted a fear posture. Moreover, whereas control quail spent as much time in the different areas of their cages, treated quail spent more time in the rear part of their cages. Finally, whereas control quail habituated gradually to feed near the experimenter's hand, treated quail did not. All these tests evidence negative short- and long-term effects on treated quail's reactivity to a passive human being and on their habituation to a human being when her presence is positively reinforced. This highlights the importance of young poultry's experience with humans in production."
