https://openalex.org/W2010521915,"The entry of primate immunodeficiency viruses into target cells depends on a sequential interaction of the gp120 envelope glycoprotein with the cellular receptors, CD4 and members of the chemokine receptor family. The gp120 third variable (V3) loop has been implicated in chemokine receptor binding, but the use of the CCR5 chemokine receptor by diverse primate immunodeficiency viruses suggests the involvement of an additional, conserved gp120 element. Through the use of gp120 mutants, a highly conserved gp120 structure was shown to be critical for CCR5 binding. This structure is located adjacent to the V3 loop and contains neutralization epitopes induced by CD4 binding. This conserved element may be a useful target for pharmacologic or prophylactic intervention in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections."
https://openalex.org/W1969321910,"Lipoprotein peroxidation, especially the modification of apolipoprotein B-100, has been implicated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. However, there have been few detailed insights into the chemical mechanism of derivatization of apolipoproteins during oxidation. In the present study, we provide evidence that the formation of the toxic pollutant acrolein (CH2=CH–CHO) and its conjugate with lysine residues is involved in the oxidative modification of human low density lipoprotein (LDL). Upon incubation with LDL, acrolein preferentially reacted with lysine residues. To determine the structure of acrolein-lysine adduct in protein, the reaction of acrolein with a lysine derivative was carried out. EmployingNα-acetyllysine, we detected a single product, which was identified to be a novel acrolein-lysine adduct,Nα-acetyl-Nε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine. The acid hydrolysis of the adduct led to the derivative that was detectable with amino acid analysis. It was revealed that, uponin vitro incubation of LDL with acrolein, the lysine residues that had disappeared were partially recovered byNε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine. In addition, we found that the same derivative was detected in the oxidatively modified LDL with Cu2+ and that the adduct formation was correlated with LDL peroxidation assessed by the consumption of α-tocopherol and cholesteryl ester and the concomitant formation of cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that measures free acrolein revealed that a considerable amount of acrolein was released from the Cu2+-oxidized LDL. Furthermore, metal-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonate was associated with the formation of acrolein, indicating that polyunsaturated fatty acids including arachidonate represent potential sources of acrolein generated during the peroxidation of LDL. These results indicate that acrolein is not just a pollutant but also a lipid peroxidation product that could be ubiquitously generated in biological systems.

Atherosclerosis is a complex vascular disorder that can lead to more serious conditions such as myocardial infarction. The events in atherosclerosis are monocyte migration from the blood stream, its differentiation into macrophage in situ, uptake of LDL by macrophage-scavenger receptor, transformation of lipid-laden macrophage into foam cells, smooth muscle cell proliferation and transformation into foam cells, and thus the accumulation of foam cells leading to fatty streaks and subsequent plaque formation. Various lines of evidence indicate that an important part of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is the oxidative modification of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; FDP-lysine,Nε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine; HNE, 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; LC-MS, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; apoB, apolipoprotein B-100; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

It has been proposed that LDL undergoes oxidative modification before it can give rise to foam cells, the key component of the progression of atherosclerosis. It has been believed that the oxidation of LDLin vivo can be reproduced by in vitro incubation of LDL with cultured cells such as endothelial cells (6Henriksen T.E. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. Proc.

These cell-mediated or metal-catalyzed modifications convert LDL to a form that is recognized by macrophages far more readily than normal LDL (6Henriksen T.E. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6499-6503Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar,13Henriksen T.E. Mahoney E.M. Steinberg D. Arteriosclerosis. 1983; 3: 149-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake of oxidized LDL leads to the formation of foam cells, the dominant cells in atherosclerotic lesions (4Rosenfeld M.E. Palinski W. Ylä-Herttuala S. Butler S. Witztum J.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 336-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). During incubation of LDL with cells, the LDL molecule undergoes a large number of structural changes that alter its metabolism (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a detailed mechanism for the oxidative modification of LDL has not been established, it is generally accepted that the primary generation of lipid hydroperoxide derivatives initiates a reaction cascade leading to rapid propagation and to amplification in the number of reactive oxygen species formed; this ultimately leads to extensive fragmentation of the fatty acid chains (14Esterbauer H. Gebicki J. Puhl H. Jürgen G. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1992; 13: 341-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (2150) Google Scholar) and conversion of the LDL to a more atherogenic form (15Quinn M.T. Parthasarathy S. Fong L.G. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2995-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar). Acrolein, an unpleasant and troublesome by-product of overheated organic matter, occurs as a ubiquitous pollutant in the environment,e.g. incomplete combustion of plastic materials, cigarette smoking, and overheating frying oils. Acrolein is also a metabolite formed in the biotransformation of allyl compounds and the widely used anticancer drug cyclophosphamide. Since it was identified as one of the “unnatural” components of tobacco smoke (16Johnstone R.A.W. Plimmer J.R. Chem. Rev. 1959; 59: 885-936Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), a number of reports have appeared describing the damaging effects of acrolein on the tracheal ciliatory movement (17Kensler C.J. Battista S.P. N. Engl. J. Med. 1963; 269: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and the pulmonary wall (18Izard C. Liberman C. Mutat. Res. 1978; 47: 115-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Its high reactivity indeed makes acrolein a dangerous substance for the living cell. It has been shown that acrolein reduces the colony-forming efficiency of mammalian cells, forms cyclic adducts with nucleosidesin vitro, and is a potent mutagen (19Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). Among all α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, acrolein is by far the strongest electrophile and, therefore, shows the highest reactivity with nucleophiles, such as the sulfhydryl group of cysteine, imidazole group of histidine, and amino group of lysine (19Esterbauer H. Schaur R.J. Zollner H. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1991; 11: 81-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (5936) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of the oxidative modification of lipoproteins in vivo, we initiated studies on the identification of covalently modified amino acids generated duringin vitro incubation of protein with lipid peroxidation products. In the present study, we identified a novel acrolein-lysine adduct,Nε-(3-formyl-3,4-dehydropiperidino)lysine (FDP-lysine) and found that the adduct is generated during in vitro peroxidation of human plasma lipoproteins. In addition, we demonstrate that the formation of FDP-lysine in the oxidized LDL is mediated by the formation of free acrolein during the peroxidation. We provide evidence that free acrolein is indeed formed during the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Nα-Acetyl-l-lysine,Nα-acetyl-l-histidine, acrolein, arachidonate, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. The reaction mixture (10 ml) contained acrolein (1–100 mm) andNα-acetyllysine (100 mm) orNα-acetylhistidine (100 mm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, the acrolein-Nα-acetyllysine adducts were analyzed and purified with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column (8 × 250 mm) (Nomura Chemicals) equilibrated in a solution of 5% methanol in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, flow rate being 2.5 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 227 nm. The N-formylethylated histidine adduct was isolated with a reverse-phase HPLC using a Develosil ODS-HG-5 column equilibrated in a solution of 0.1% heptafluorobutyric acid, flow rate being 2.5 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by absorbance at 215 nm. Changes in the amino acid composition and the formation of acrolein-lysine adduct (FDP-lysine) were assessed by amino acid analysis. The authentic acrolein adducts (Nα-acetyl-FDP-lysine andNα-acetyl-formylethylhistidine) or the FDP-lysine residue generated in proteins was treated with NaBH4 prior to the acid hydrolysis. An aliquot (0.1 ml) of LDL incubated in the absence or presence of acrolein or Cu2+ was treated with 10 mm EDTA (10 μl), 1 n NaOH (10 μl), and 100 mm NaBH4 (10 μl). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the mixture was treated with 1 n HCl (30 μl), evaporated to dryness, and then hydrolyzed in vacuowith 6 n HCl for 24 h at 105 °C. The hydrolysates were concentrated and dissolved with 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2). The amino acid analysis was performed with a JEOL JLC-500 amino acid analyzer equipped with a JEOL LC30-DK20 data analyzing system. LDL was separated from the plasma of a healthy donor by ultracentrifugation as described in the literature (20Ramos P. Gieseg S.P. Schuster B. Esterbauer H. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 2113-2128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) within a density cut-off of 1.019–1.063 g/ml and then dialyzed with cellulose membranes in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 100 μm EDTA. It was sterilized with Mille-GV filter (Millipore) after dialysis. The protein concentration of LDL was measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay reagent (Pierce). Acrolein-modified LDL was prepared by incubating 50 μg of LDL with acrolein (0–1 mm) in 0.1 ml of 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 37 °C. The oxidation of LDL (0.5 mg protein/ml) was carried out at 37 °C under air in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). LDL was dialyzed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) to remove EDTA prior to the oxidation by 5 μm Cu2+. Free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester were separated by HPLC on an LC-18 column (particle size 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Supelco, Tokyo) eluted with acetonitrile/2-propanol (30/70, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and detected by UV absorption at 210 nm as reported in the literature (21Jessup W. Mohr D. Gieseg S.P. Dean R.T. Stocker R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 73-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The cholesteryl ester hydroperoxide (CEOOH) and hydroxide (CEOH) were measured with an HPLC using a UV detector at 234 nm as described previously (22Noguchi N. Sakai H. Kato Y. Tsuchiya J. Yamamoto Y. Niki E. Horikoshi H. Kodama T. Atherosclerosis. 1996; 123: 227-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). α-Tocopherol was analyzed with an HPLC detected with an electrochemical detector (Kotaki, Tokyo) set at +800 mV. The LC-18 column (particle size 5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm) was used, and the eluent was methanol/tert-butyl alcohol (90/10, v/v) containing 50 mm NaClO4, flow rate being 1.0 ml/min. The data presented in this paper are the representative examples of several separate experiments. Although the different LDL samples showed a different length of lag time and rate of oxidation, they showed a similar pattern of oxidative modification. The iron-catalyzed oxidation of arachidonate was performed by incubating 2 mm arachidonate with 10 μm Fe2+, 1 mm ascorbate, or 10 μm Fe2+ and 1 mm ascorbate in 0.1 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) under atmospheric oxygen. Based on the procedure for the measurement of free 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (23Uchida K. Osawa T. Hiai H. Toyokuni S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 1068-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), free acrolein was immnuochemically determined. To coat the wells of the microtiter plate, 100 μl/well of the protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) (1 mg/ml) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was used and was incubated overnight at 4 °C. Following washing with TBS containing 10% Tween 20 (TBS/Tween), 100 μl of the LDL or arachidonate solution was added to the wells. After incubation for 2 h at 37 °C followed by washing with TBS/Tween, each well was filled with 200 ml of Block Ace solution (100 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. The monoclonal antibody (mAb5F6) 2K. Uchida, M. Kanematsu, K. Sakai, T. Matsuda, N. Hattori, Y. Mizuno, D. Suzuki, T. Miyata, N. Noguchi, E. Niki, and T. Osawa (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95,4882–4887. was then added to the wells at 100 μl/well of 10 mg/ml solution for 3 h at 37 °C or overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with TBS/Tween, 100 μl/well of peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antiserum (1:4000) was added and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing, 100 μl of 0.05 m citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.4 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine and 0.003% H2O2 was added and incubated for several minutes at room temperature. The reaction was terminated by adding 2m sulfuric acid, and the absorbance at 490 nm was read on a micro-ELISA plate reader. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was performed using electrospray ionization and detection with a VG Platform II mass spectrometer. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was performed using a Bruker ARX-400 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. The selectivity of the binding of acrolein to lysine residues was assessed by changes in the amino acid composition of acrolein-treated proteins. When LDL (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 0.5 mm acrolein for 24 h at 37 °C, about 40% of the lysine residues was lost, and no significant change in other amino acids was observed. The data suggested that the lysine residues of proteins represented primary targets for reaction with acrolein. Hence, in an effort to determine the structure of the acrolein-lysine adduct generated in the protein, the reaction of acrolein withNα-acetyllysine was carried out. Upon incubation of N-acetyllysine (100 mm) with various concentrations of acrolein for 12 h at 37 °C, one product was detected exclusively even in the presence of a large excess of the lysine derivative (Fig. 1). After purification, the product was then characterized by 1H- and13C-NMR and LC-MS along withNα-acetyllysine. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra (in D2O) of the product are shown in Fig. 2. Compared with the1H- and 13C-NMR spectra betweenNα-acetyllysine and the product, the following signals were easily assigned for the presence of nativeNα-acetyllysine structure in the product: δH 1.25 (2H, m, H-γ), 1.60 (2H, m, H-δ), 1.60 (1H, m, Ha-β), 1.71 (1H, m, Hb-β), 1.82 (3H, s,Nα -acetyl), 3.07 (2H, t, J = 8.3 Hz, H-ε), 4.14 (1H, dd, J = 9.0, 5.1 Hz, H-α); δC 21.5 (Nα -acetyl), 22.0 (C-γ), 23.0 (C-δ), 29.8 (C-b), 52.3 (C-α), 55.8 (C-ε), 174.2 (Nα -acetyl), 175.6 (COOH). Six signals (δC 23.3 t, 47.1 t, 48.4 t, 133.0 s, 148.8 d, and 193.6 d) remained in the13C-NMR spectrum of the product, which seemed to originate from two molecules of acrolein in the reaction withNε-amine ofNα-acetyllysine. The 1H- and 13C-NMR spectra of the product showed the presence of one methylene (δH 2.62/δC 23.3), twoNε-linked methylenes (δH 3.53, 3.96/δC 47.1 and δH 3.05, 3.48/δC 48.4), one olefinic methine (δH 7.06/δC 148.8), one formylmethine (δH 9.21/δC 193.6), and one olefinic quaternary carbon (δC 133.0). The three signals (δH 7.06/δC 148.8, δH 9.21/δC 193.6, and δC 133.0) suggested the presence of conjugated double bond moiety (–CH=C(CHO)–). A partial structure, –CH2–CH2–CH=C(CHO)–CH2–, was constructed by analyzing the results of 1H-1H COSY experiments (Fig. 3). The connectivity from C-2 to C-6 of the product was observed including the long-range coupling between C-2 and C-4 (indicated by bold lines and an arrow in Fig. 2). Finally, the six signals were assigned as follows: δH 2.62 (2H, m, H-5), 3.05 (1H, dt, Ha-6), 3.48 (1H, dt, J = 12.5, 3.9 Hz, Hb-6), 3.53 (1H, d, J = 16.2 Hz, Ha-2), 3.96 (1H, d, J = 16.2 Hz, Hb-2), 7.06 (1H, br s, H-4), 9.21 (1H, s, 3-formyl); δC 23.3 (C-5), 47.1 (C-2), 48.4 (C-6), 133.0 (C-3), 148.8 (C-4), and 193.6 (3-formyl). The LC-MS data for the product clearly showed the (M+H)+ peak atm/z 283 (Fig. 4). This was in agreement with the proposed structure (Fig. 5 A). Based on these characteristics, it was determined that the product was a novel acrolein-lysine adduct,Nα-acetyl-FDP-lysine.Figure 2The proposed structure (A) and the 1H- (B) and 13C-NMR (C) spectra of the main product generated from the reaction of Nα-acetyllysine with acrolein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Two-dimensional total correlation spectrum ofNα-acetyl-FDP-lysine.

To characterize an acrolein-histidine adduct, we carried out the reaction ofNα-acetylhistidine with acrolein and isolated the formylethylated histidine derivative (Nα-acetyl-N-formylethylhistidine), which was previously reported by Pocker and Janjic (24Pocker Y. Janjic N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6169-6176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the adduct is generated from the nucleophilic attack of the imidazole nitrogen on the ethylenic bond of acrolein. The adduct is presumed to be a mixture of the isomeric form ofNπ- andNτ-substituted adducts of the imidazole ring (Fig. 5, B and C). The fact that FDP-lysine was the most predominant form of acrolein upon reaction with the lysine derivative led us to assess the formation of this adduct in the in vitro modification of the protein. To assess the formation of FDP-lysine in proteins, we first attempted to detect the adduct in the hydrolyzed samples of authentic acrolein-Nα-acetyllysine adduct (Nα-acetyl-FDP-lysine). Upon acid hydrolysis followed by amino acid analysis ofNα-acetyl-FDP-lysine, a new peak that was distinguishable from other amino acids was detected. Whereas, it should be noted that even if the acrolein-Nα-acetylhistidine adduct (Nα-acetyl-Nπ(τ)-formylethylhistidine) was reduced with NaBH4, acid hydrolysis of the adduct gave a single peak that was eluted at a retention time completely identical to that of histidine (data not shown). This observation suggested that the acid hydrolysis ofNπ(τ)-formylethylhistidine led to quantitative release of the histidyl moiety as free histidine. To assess the formation of FDP-lysine in protein, the hydrolysate of LDL treated with acrolein was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 6 A, incubation of LDL with acrolein (0–1 mm) for 2 h at 37 °C resulted in the loss of up to 110.3 lysine residues per mole of LDL (the total number of lysine residues per mole of LDL apoB obtained by amino acid analysis was 390 molecules). These losses were accompanied by the formation of FDP-lysine (12.1 mol/mol), accounting for about 11% of the lysine residues that had disappeared. Fig. 6 B demonstrates the time-dependent formation of FDP-lysine in the LDL treated with 0.5 mm acrolein at 37 °C. The concentration reached about 7 molecules of the adduct per protein molecule after 1 h of incubation. This accounted for about 30% of the lysine residues that had disappeared. Of particular importance is the observation that FDP-lysine is detected in the oxidized LDL (Fig. 7). Various lines of evidence have indicated that an important part of the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is the oxidative modification of plasma LDL (1Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C.

In addition, it has been shown that oxidation of LDL generates a variety of reactive aldehyde products that covalently bind to the LDL apolipoproteins (25Uchida K. Toyokuni S. Nishikawa K.

J. 1997; 322: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Hence, we examined the kinetics of LDL peroxidation and the formation of FDP-lysine. When the oxidation of LDL was induced by 5 μm Cu2+, a small amount of α-tocopherol remained after 2 h of incubation (Fig. 8 A). Cholesteryl esters, which have polyunsaturated acid moieties, were consumed with time, and all of them disappeared by 12 h of incubation (Fig. 8 B). The depletion of cholesteryl ester occurred in the following order: cholesteryl docosahexaenoate (CE22:6) > cholesteryl arachidonate (CE20:4) > cholesteryl linoleate (CE18:2). The consumption of free cholesterol was observed after substantially all of the cholesteryl esters having polyunsaturated acid moieties were depleted. The formation of cholesteryl linoleate hydroperoxide (CE18:2-OOH) increased and then decreased due to its decomposition. Because the formation and decomposition of cholesteryl arachidonate hydroperoxide (CE20:4-OOH) and cholesteryl docosahexaenoate hydroperoxide (CE22:6-OOH) proceeded faster than that of CE18:2-OOH, the accumulation of CE20:4-OOH and CE22:6-OOH was not observed at 2 h of incubation. When the oxidation of LDL was initiated at a slower rate, the formation and decomposition of both CE20:4-OOH and CE22:6-OOH was observed (data not shown). The lipid peroxidation in LDL was accompanied by a time-dependent increase in the formation of FDP-lysine (Fig. 8 C). The formation of the FDP-lysine reached a plateau as soon as CE18:2 was depleted. After 12 h of incubation, approximately 4 molecules of the adduct per LDL molecule were formed. The amount corresponded to 3.4% of the lysine residues that disappeared during LDL peroxidation. During this period, at least 750 molecules of CE18:2 per LDL molecule disappeared and 85 molecules of CE18:2-OOH per LDL molecule were accumulated.Figure 8Kinetics of LDL peroxidation and the formation of FDP-lysine. LDL (0.5 mg protein/ml) was incubated with 5 μm Cu2+ at 37 °C. A, the consumption of α-tocopherol (▴), free cholesterol (□), and cholesteryl esters (CE18:2, ○; CE20:4, ▵; CE22:6, ⊞) was followed.

B, the consumption of cholesteryl linoleate (18:2, ○), arachidonate (20:4, ▵), and docosahexaenoate (22:6, ⊞), and free cholesterol (□) is shown by a fraction of the remaining substrate. C, FDP-lysine (▪), generated in the oxidized LDL, was measured by amino acid analysis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The observation that a significant amount of acrolein-derived lysine adduct (FDP-lysine) was detected in the oxidized LDL led us to examine whether LDL peroxidation is associated with the production of free acrolein. In the present experiments, to assess the formation of acrolein during LDL peroxidation, we developed the immunochemical procedure using the monoclonal antibody (mAb5F6) specific to FDP-lysine. Taking advantage of the fact that acrolein reacts with proteins and forms stable adducts with lysine and histidine residues, we developed a procedure that distinguishes free acrolein from acrolein covalently attached to the proteins. In this procedure, only free acrolein in the samples can react with the protein that has been coated on the immunoplate (Fig. 9 A). The acrolein-derived epitopes generated in the coating protein are then detected by ELISA using the monoclonal antibody (mAb5F6) specific to FDP-lysine. It is thus expected that this method can specifically detect acrolein that is not conjugated to proteins or other molecules in the samples. As shown in Fig. 9 B, it was clearly revealed that the incubation of LDL with Cu2+ led to a time-dependent format"
https://openalex.org/W2027579967,"We have isolated a cDNA from rat placenta which, when expressed heterologously, mediates the transport of a wide spectrum of organic cations. The cDNA codes for a protein of 551 amino acids containing 12 putative transmembrane domains. Northern blot analysis indicates that this transporter is expressed most abundantly in the placenta and moderately in the intestine, heart, and brain. The expression is comparatively low in the kidney and lung and is undetectable in the liver. This transporter is distinct from the previously cloned organic cation transporters (OCT1, OCT2, NKT, NLT, RST, and OCTN1). When expressed in HeLa cells, the cDNA induces the transport of tetraethylammonium and guanidine. Competition experiments indicate that this transport process recognizes a large number of organic cations, including the neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, as substrates. The cDNA-induced transport is markedly influenced by extracellular pH. However, when expressed in Xenopus laevisoocytes, the cDNA-induced transport is electrogenic, associated with the transfer of positive charge into the oocytes. Under voltage clamp conditions, tetraethylammonium evokes inward currents that are concentration- and potential-dependent. This potential-sensitive organic cation transporter, designated as OCT3, represents a new member of the OCT gene family.

Under voltage clamp conditions, tetraethylammonium evokes inward currents that are concentration- and potential-dependent. This potential-sensitive organic cation transporter, designated as OCT3, represents a new member of the OCT gene family. Specific transport systems exist in mammalian cells that are responsible for the influx of organic cations into the cells as well as their efflux out of the cells (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 2Ullrich K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Several xenobiotics are positively charged at physiological pH, and therefore the organic cation transport systems play a critical role in the handling of these xenobiotics by mammalian tissues. Special attention has been given to the function of organic cation transport systems in two organs, the kidney and the liver, because of the role these organs are known to play in the elimination of xenobiotics. Functional studies have led to the identification of two distinct classes of organic cation transport systems, one driven by the transmembrane potential difference and the other driven by the transmembrane H+ gradient (1Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 765-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 2Ullrich K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 45-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The potential-sensitive transport system is likely to participate in the influx of organic cations, whereas the H+gradient-dependent transport system is likely to participate in the efflux of organic cations. In the renal proximal tubular epithelial cells, the cationic xenobiotics enter the cell across the basolateral membrane and exit the cell across the brush border membrane. Thus, a concerted action of the potential-sensitive transport system in the basolateral membrane and the H+-dependent transport system in the brush border membrane effectively mediates the elimination of several xenobiotics by the kidney. The placenta, which provides the sole link between the mother and the developing fetus, functions as a protective barrier for the fetus by participating in the clearance of xenobiotics from the fetal circulation. The syncytiotrophoblast, which is the functional unit of the placenta, is a polarized cell layer consisting of a basal membrane in contact with the fetal circulation and a brush border membrane in contact with the maternal blood. As has been shown in the renal proximal tubule, it is likely that the two classes of organic cation transport systems operate in the placental syncytiotrophoblast in the elimination of cationic xenobiotics from the fetus. We have shown previously, using purified human placental brush border membrane vesicles, that a H+ gradient-dependent organic cation transport system is expressed in the placenta and that this system is likely to be responsible for the removal of cationic xenobiotics from the syncytiotrophoblast (3Ganapathy V.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23632-23639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of a potential-sensitive organic cation transport system has not been demonstrated in normal placenta, but such a system is present in the JAR human placental choriocarcinoma cell line (5Zevin S. Schaner M.E. Illsley N.P. Giacomini K.M. Pharm. Res. (NY). 1997; 14: 401-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In recent years, several members belonging to a common gene family of organic cation transporters have been cloned and characterized. The first member to be cloned was rat OCT1 which is a potential-sensitive transporter and is expressed primarily in the kidney and liver (6Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Subsequently, rat and porcine OCT2 were cloned (7Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Human homologs of OCT1 and OCT2 have also been cloned and functionally characterized (9Gorboulev V. Ulzheimer J.C. Akhoundova A. Ulzheimer-Teuber I. Karbach U. Quester S. Baumann C. Lang F.

Tanaka I. Nakao K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NKT, NLT, and RST are included in the gene family of organic cation transporters solely based on amino acid sequence similarity. There is no information available on the transport function of these three clones. Based on amino acid sequence homology, NKT is likely to be the murine homolog of the rat organic anion transporter (14Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Endou H. J. Biol.

Most recently, cloning of an additional member of the gene family has been reported (16Tamai I. Yabuuchi H. Nezu J.I. Sai Y. Oku A. Shimane M. Tsuji A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). This clone, called OCTN1, is functional and appears to be H+-dependent. Interestingly, except for OCTN1 which is expressed in several tissues in addition to the kidney, all other members of the family are expressed primarily in the kidney and/or liver. In this paper we report on the cloning of a new member of the potential-sensitive organic cation transporter gene family which is expressed most abundantly in placenta. SuperScript Plasmid System for cDNA library construction and Lipofectin for transfection in mammalian cells were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega. Magna nylon transfer membranes were purchased from Micron Separations (Westboro, MA). Unlabeled organic cations were from either Sigma or Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA). The RNA transcription kit mMESSAGE mMACHINETM for the synthesis of cRNA was obtained from Ambion. The Trizol reagent for the isolation of total RNA was from Life Technologies, Inc., and the ready-to-go oligolabeling kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [ethyl-1-14C]Tetraethylammonium bromide (specific radioactivity, 55 mCi/mmol) was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). [14C]Guanidine (specific radioactivity, 116 mCi/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. [α-32P]dCTP was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The cDNA probe used for screening was a 0.9-kilobase pair fragment of rat OCT1 cDNA obtained by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using rat intestinal mRNA. This probe corresponded to the nucleotide position 495–1388 in the published sequence of the rat OCT1 cDNA (6Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). The cDNA probe was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the ready-to-go oligolabeling kit. The rat placental cDNA library (17Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7501-7506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was screened with this probe under low stringency conditions. Hybridization was carried out for 20 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 5× SSPE (1× SSPE = 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm NaH2PO4, and 1 mmEDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Post-hybridization washing was done as described earlier (17Prasad P.D. Wang H. Kekuda R. Fujita T. Fei Y.J. Devoe L.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7501-7506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) which involved extensive washes with 3× SSPE, 0.5% SDS at room temperature. Positive clones were identified and the colonies purified by secondary screening. Both sense and antisense strands of the cDNA were sequenced by primer walking. Sequencing by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method was performed byTaq DyeDeoxy terminator cycle sequencing with an automated Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems 377 Prism DNA Sequencer. The sequence was analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package GCG version 7.B (Genetics Computer Group, Inc. Madison, WI). Data base searches were done using the GenBankTM Program BLAST (18Benson D.A. Boguski M. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The cDNA was functionally expressed in HeLa cells by vaccinia virus expression system as described previously (19Ramamoorthy S. Leibach F.H. Mahesh V.B. Han H. Yang-Feng T.L. Blakely R.D.

Physiol. 1997; 272: G1463-G1472PubMed Google Scholar). Transport measurements were made at room temperature using [14C]guanidine and [14C]tetraethylammonium. The transport buffer was composed of 25 mm Tris/Hepes (pH 8.5), supplemented with 280 mm mannitol, 5.4 mmKCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, and 5 mm glucose. When the influence of pH on transport was investigated, transport buffers of different pH values were prepared by varying the concentrations of Tris, Hepes, and Mes. 1The abbreviations used are: Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; TMA, tetramethylammonium; TEA, tetraethylammonium; MPP, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium. The incubation time for transport measurements was 30 min. Transport was terminated by aspiration of the uptake buffer followed by two washes with 2 ml of ice-cold transport buffer. Following this, the cells were solubilized with 0.5 ml of 1% SDS in 0.2 n NaOH and transferred to vials for quantitation of the radioactivity associated with the cells. HeLa cells transfected with empty vector under similar conditions served as control. In experiments dealing with saturation kinetics, data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and confirmed by linear regression. The pSPORT-cDNA construct was linearized with NotI, and the cDNA insert was transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of ribonuclease inhibitor and RNA cap analog. The mMESSAGE mMACHINETM kit was employed for this purpose. Mature (stages V–VI), defolliculated oocytes from Xenopus laevis(Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) were selected and maintained at 18 °C in modified Barth's medium (21Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) with 10 mg/liter gentamycin sulfate. Oocytes were injected 1 day after isolation with ∼50 ng of cRNA and used for electrophysiological studies 5 days after cRNA injection. Water-injected oocytes were used as controls. A two-microelectrode voltage clamp system (22Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Acta. 1996; 1284: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used to measure steady-state tetraethylammonium-evoked currents. Oocytes were superfused with a NaCl-containing buffer (pH 6.5, 7.5, or 8.5) (in mm: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 Hepes/Mes/Tris) containing varying concentrations of tetraethylammonium. Membrane potential was held at −50 mV. For studies involving the current- voltage (membrane potential) (I–V) relationship, step changes in membrane potential were applied, each for a duration of 100 ms in 20-mV increments. Kinetic parameters for the saturable transport of tetraethylammonium were calculated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression and confirmed by linear regression. Uptake of [14C]guanidine and [14C]tetraethylammonium into oocytes was measured in a 24-well microtiter plate as described previously (25Fei Y.J. Prasad P.D. Leibach F.H. Ganapathy V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8744-8751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The influence of membrane potential on the uptake was studied as described by Grundemann et al. (6Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar) by changing the concentration of K+ in the uptake buffer or by adding Ba2+, a K+ channel blocker to the uptake buffer. Screening of the rat placental cDNA library using an ∼0.9-kilobase pair fragment of the rat OCT1 cDNA as the probe led to the identification of three positive clones. Sequence analysis indicated that these clones were identical. One of these clones, designated as OCT3, was arbitrarily chosen for further structural analysis. The rat placental OCT3 cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number AF055286) is 3,502 base pairs long with an open reading frame of 1,656 base pairs (including termination codon), encoding a protein of 551 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of OCT3 is given in Fig. 1. The predicted molecular mass of the protein is 61 kDa. Hydrophobicity analysis using the algorithm of Kyte and Doolittle (26Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) and with 20–21 amino acid residues per membrane spanning domain indicated that the protein possesses 12 putative transmembrane domains. When rat OCT3 is modeled based on the published models of several cloned transporters and by the application of the inside-positive rule (27Von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), both the amino terminus and the carboxyl terminus lie on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. This model predicts a large extracellular loop (106 amino acids) between transmembrane domains 1 and 2 which contain three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation (NX(T/S)) at positions 72, 99, and 114. There is also an additional putativeN-glycosylation site at position 199 in the short extracellular loop between the transmembrane domains 3 and 4. The predicted protein also contains three potential sites for protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation (Ser-286, Thr-292, and Thr-459) and two potential sites for protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation (Thr-346 and Thr-544) in putative intracellular domains. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of rat OCT3 with the protein sequence data base revealed that OCT3 is not identical to any of the previously cloned proteins. However, the OCT3 amino acid sequence bears significant homology to the known members of the organic cation transporter gene family. At the amino acid sequence level, the identity ranges between 30 and 51% and the similarity ranges between 54 and 73%. The greatest homology is seen with OCT1 and OCT2 (Fig. 1). Poly(A)+ RNA prepared from several rat tissues was analyzed by Northern blot hybridization for the presence of mRNA transcripts for OCT3 (Fig. 2). A primary transcript, 3.5 kilobases in size, was detectable in the placenta, intestine, heart, brain, lung, and kidney. The transcript was not detectable in the liver. Among the positive tissues, the OCT3 transcript was most abundant in the placenta, followed by intestine, heart, and brain. The abundance of the transcript was low in the kidney and lung. In order to establish the functional identity of OCT3 as an organic cation transporter, we employed the vaccinia virus expression system to functionally express the OCT3 cDNA in HeLa cells. First, we used guanidine as the organic cation substrate for transport measurements in OCT3 cDNA-transfected cells. Cells transfected with empty vector served as the control. Initial experiments indicated that the uptake of guanidine in cDNA-transfected cells was higher than in control cells and that the cDNA-induced uptake was enhanced if the pH of the uptake medium was higher than 7.5 and mannitol was substituted for NaCl. Fig. 3 describes the uptake of guanidine in mannitol medium at varying pH. At pH 5.5, there was very little difference in guanidine uptake between cDNA-transfected cells and control cells. However, when the pH of the uptake medium was raised above 5.5, the difference in uptake between the cDNA-transfected cells and control cells became evident. At pH 8.5, uptake of guanidine (35 μm) was about 75% higher in cDNA-transfected cells compared with control cells. When the cDNA-induced uptake alone was analyzed, there was a marked pH dependence of the uptake activity. The uptake was found to be enhanced about 9-fold when the pH of the uptake medium was changed from 6.5 to 8.5. The substrate specificity of the cDNA-induced uptake activity was investigated by assessing the effect of various organic cations on the uptake of [14C]guanidine in control and cDNA-transfected cells (Table I). The uptake of [14C]guanidine in control cells as well as in cDNA-transfected cells was inhibited by all organic cations tested. Similarly, the cDNA-specific uptake was also inhibited by several organic cations. It can be inferred from the data that HeLa cells express endogenously an organic cation transport system. When the inhibitory potency of various organic cations was compared between the endogenous uptake and the cDNA-specific uptake, clear differences between the two uptake processes became apparent. Most notably, choline and tetramethylammonium (TMA) did not have any significant effect on the cDNA-specific uptake, whereas they caused a marked inhibition of the endogenous uptake. On the other hand, compounds such as tetraethylammonium (TEA), cimetidine, and serotonin were found to be more potent in inhibiting the cDNA-specific uptake than in inhibiting the endogenous uptake. Thus, the cDNA-induced organic cation uptake process is clearly distinct from the organic cation uptake process that is constitutively expressed in HeLa cells. With respect to the cDNA-induced uptake process, the most potent inhibitors were TEA, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP), 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, serotonin, dimethylamiloride, desipramine, and cimetidine. Moderate inhibition was observed withN1-methylnicotinamide, guanidine, and nicotine. Choline and TMA showed very little or no inhibition. Among the inhibitors tested, TEA, TMA,N1-methylnicotinamide, choline, and MPP are permanently cationic, whereas the remaining are cationic buffers.Table ISubstrate specificity of the OCT3 cDNA-induced uptakeUnlabeled compound[14C]Guanidine uptakepSPORTpSPORT-cDNAcDNA-specificnmol/106 cells/30 minNone0.46 ± 0.02 (100)0.81 ± 0.04 (100)0.35 (100)Guanidine (12.5)0.15 ± 0.01 (33)0.25 ± 0.01 (31)0.10 (29)TEA0.27 ± 0.01 (59)0.33 ± 0.01 (41)0.06 (17)TMA0.11 ± 0.02 (24)0.48 ± 0.01 (59)0.37 (106)N1-Methylnicotinamide0.19 ± 0.01 (41)0.27 ± 0.01 (33)0.08 (23)Nicotine (8.0)0.23 ± 0.01 (50)0.42 ± 0.02 (52)0.19 (54)Cimetidine (6.8)0.28 ± 0.01 (61)0.33 ± 0.01 (41)0.05 (14)Choline0.09 ± 0.01 (20)0.40 ± 0.01 (49)0.31 (89)Desipramine (10.2)0.01 ± 0.01 (2)0.01 ± 0.01 (1)0 (0)MPP0.13 ± 0.01 (28)0.18 ± 0.01 (22)0.05 (14)MPTP0.08 ± 0.01 (17)0.11 ± 0.01 (14)0.03 (9)Serotonin (9.1)0.21 ± 0.01 (46)0.24 ± 0.01 (30)0.03 (9)Dimethylamiloride0.10 ± 0.01 (22)0.10 ± 0.01 (12)0 (0)HeLa cells were transfected with either pSPORT-OCT3 cDNA or pSPORT alone.

TEA has been used as the prototypical organic cation in elucidating the functional characteristics of the previously cloned organic cation transporters (6Grundemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar, 7Okuda M. Saito H. Urakami Y. Takano M. Inui K.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Since TEA was found to be a potent inhibitor of guanidine uptake mediated by OCT3, it appeared that TEA may be transported by this newly cloned organic cation transporter. Therefore we investigated the ability of OCT3 to transport TEA in HeLa cells (Fig. 4). The uptake of TEA was found to be higher in OCT3 cDNA-transfected cells than in control cells. The cDNA-specific uptake of TEA showed a marked pH dependence, a characteristic similar to that observed with the cDNA-induced guanidine uptake. The cDNA-specific TEA uptake was stimulated almost 4-fold when the pH of the uptake medium was changed from 6.5 to 8.5. However, an important difference was noticeable between guanidine and TEA when the uptake activity was compared in control cells and in cDNA-transfected cells. The endogenous uptake activity in control cells was severalfold lower for TEA than for guanidine. Because of this, the difference in the uptake activity between control cells and cDNA-transfected cells was greater for TEA than for guanidine. At pH 8.5, the uptake of guanidine increased only by about 75% (1.75-fold) as the result of OCT3 expression compared with control cells (Fig. 3). Under similar conditions, OCT3 expression led to an increase of 1100% (12-fold) in TEA uptake (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 describes the saturation kinetics of TEA uptake in HeLa cells mediated by OCT3. Uptake was measured in control cells and in cDNA-transfected cells with varying concentrations of TEA (0.25–5 mm). The uptake in control cells was only a fraction (<10%) of the uptake in cDNA-transfected cells. This uptake value was subtracted from the uptake in cDNA-transfected cells to determine the cDNA-specific uptake which was then used in kinetic analysis. The OCT3-mediated TEA uptake was saturable with a Michaelis-Menten constant of 2.5 ± 0.2 mm. The experiments described thus far have shown that OCT3 cDNA encodes an organic cation transporter possessing a broad substrate specificity. These experiments have also indicated that the OCT3-mediated transport activity is pH-dependent, the activity being stimulated by an outwardly directed H+gradient in intact cells. This is a characteristic expected of an organic cation-H+ antiport system. To determine whether or not OCT3 is an organic cation-H+ antiporter, we studied the OCT3-mediated efflux of TEA in TEA-loaded HeLa cells expressing OCT3. If OCT3 is indeed an organic cation-H+ antiporter, the efflux of TEA in OCT3-expressing cells should be stimulated by an acidic pH. To study the OCT3-mediated efflux, we incubated OCT3-expressing HeLa cells with radiolabeled TEA at pH 8.5 for 1 h, following which the medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium (with no radiolabeled TEA) at pH 6.5 or 8.5. The time-dependent efflux of TEA from the cells was then measured. The results of the experiment, shown in Fig. 6, demonstrated that OCT3-mediated efflux was not likely to be an organic cation-H+ antiport process. There was no significant difference in the rate of efflux between pH 8.5 and pH 6.5. This means that the influence of pH observed for OCT3-mediated influx of TEA was not due to the coupling of TEA influx to H+ efflux. To determine the influence of membrane potential on OCT3-mediated transport, we investigated the transport function of OCT3 in X. laevis oocytes following microinjection of OCT3 cRNA. The X. laevis oocyte expression system is ideal to investigate the characteristics of electrogenic t"

In contrast, MCT1 is expressed most abundantly in oxidative fibers but is almost totally absent in fast-twitch glycolytic fibers. Thus MCT3 appears to be the major MCT isoform responsible for efflux of glycolytically derived lactic acid from white skeletal muscle. MCT3 is also expressed in several other tissues requiring rapid lactic acid efflux. The expression of both MCT3 and MCT1 was decreased by 40–60% 3 weeks after denervation of rat hind limb muscles, whereas chronic stimulation of the muscles for 7 days increased expression of MCT1 2–3-fold but had no effect on MCT3 expression. The kinetics and substrate and inhibitor specificities of monocarboxylate transport into cell lines expressing only MCT3 or MCT1 have been determined. Differences in the properties of MCT1 and MCT3 are relatively modest, suggesting that the significance of the two isoforms may be related to their regulation rather than their intrinsic properties.

Lactic acid is both a major fuel for skeletal muscle (“red” oxidative fibers) and a major metabolic end product (“white” glycolytic muscles). Even oxidative fibers become net lactic acid exporters when oxygen supply cannot meet demand, and glycolysis is stimulated to maintain ATP supplies. Fatigue occurs when lactic acid builds up within the myocyte. This causes intracellular pH (pHi) to drop, inhibiting both glycolysis and contractile activity (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Juel C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 321-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). In the extreme case further muscle activity is totally prevented, a phenomenon used to advantage by anglers “playing” their fish to exhaustion. The transport of lactic acid out of skeletal muscle fibers is essential if such intracellular accumulation of lactic acid is to be prevented. Better removal of lactic acid from the muscle fibers might improve athletic performance during intense exercise and enable better muscle function and subsequent recovery under pathological conditions such as inherited mitochondrial diseases, hypoxia, and reperfusion following a period of ischemia. Transport of lactic acid into skeletal muscle fibers for oxidation is thought to be mediated by the proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1The abbreviations used are: MCT, monocarboxylate transporter; ELT, Ehrlich Lettré tumor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; BCECF, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein; DIDS, 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonate; FG, fast-twitch glycolytic fiber; FOG, fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fiber; SO, slow-twitch oxidative fiber; CHC, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate. isoform MCT1 whose expression correlates with the oxidative capacity of muscle fibers and is increased following chronic muscle stimulation (3McCullagh K.J.A.

However, sarcolemmal membranes of muscle fibers that are primarily glycolytic do not contain significant amounts of MCT1 yet transport lactic acid by means of a saturable carrier that is inhibited by known inhibitors of MCT1 (3McCullagh K.J.A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 861-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) cells also imply the existence of other MCT isoforms, and this conclusion has been confirmed by cloning and sequencing studies. The first MCT isoform (MCT1) was cloned from Chinese hamster ovary cells (11Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and has since been cloned and sequenced from human (12Garcia C.K. Li X. Luna J. Francke U. Genomics. 1994; 23: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), rat (13Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1238: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and mouse (14Carpenter L. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Topology predictions suggest that the transporter contains 12 transmembrane helical domains in common with many other substrate transporters, and we have confirmed this prediction experimentally (15Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Another MCT isoform (MCT2) has been cloned from hamster (16Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and rat (17Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This is the predominant MCT isoform in hamster liver, but is not widely distributed in rat tissues and is absent in skeletal muscle (17Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus it seems probable that an additional MCT isoform is responsible for lactic acid efflux from those muscle fibers lacking MCT1. Recently we have cloned and sequenced four new members of the MCT family and investigated their tissue distribution by Northern blotting (18Price N.T. Jackson V.N. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). We found that mRNA for one of these isoforms is present in large amounts in skeletal muscle, and we termed this isoform MCT3 because of its close homology to chicken MCT3, an MCT isoform found exclusively in the chicken retinal epithelium (19Yoon H.Y. Fanelli A. Grollman E.F. Philp N.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 20Philp N. Chu P. Pan T. Zhang R.Z. Chu M. Stark K. Boettiger D. Yoon H. Kieber-Emmons T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It remains to be established whether chicken MCT3 and mammalian MCT3 are produced by equivalent genes, perhaps as alternatively spliced forms (20Philp N. Chu P. Pan T. Zhang R.Z. Chu M. Stark K. Boettiger D. Yoon H. Kieber-Emmons T. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 219: 64-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), or are distinct gene products. Here we use antipeptide antibodies to confirm that mammalian MCT3 protein is also strongly expressed in skeletal muscle and in several other glycolytic cells. We have characterized its kinetics and shown that it is down-regulated in rat hind limb skeletal muscle by chronic denervation. Ehrlich Lettré tumor cells (ELT), the bovine kidney cell line NBL1, and COS cells were cultured as described elsewhere (21Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Doyle F.A. McGivan J.D. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Zhang B. Tavaré J.M. Ellis L. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 990-996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated rat cardiac myocytes, prepared as described previously (8Wang X.M. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1759-H1769PubMed Google Scholar), were kindly provided by Dr. Elinor Griffiths and human cardiac ventricle muscle by Professor Giannni Angelini (Bristol Heart Institute). Human white cells were obtained from the local blood bank and human placenta from the local maternity hospital. Antipeptide antibodies to MCT1 and MCT3 were raised in rabbits against C-terminal peptides, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin as described previously (15Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The peptides used, including an N-terminal cysteine for coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, were CQKDTEGGPKEEESPV for human MCT1 (cross-reacts with MCT1 from most species), CPQQNSSGDPAEEESPV for Chinese hamster MCT1 (cross-reacts with rat but not human MCT1), and CEPEKNGEVVHTPETSV for human MCT3. Antibodies were purified by affinity purification using the immobilized peptide as described previously (15Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). All reagents for immunofluorescence microscopy were from Sigma. Preparation of crude plasma membranes from a variety of tissue homogenates was performed in the presence of a range of protease inhibitors (24Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and samples separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Westen blotting with anti-MCT1 and -MCT3 antibodies using ECL detection (15Poole R.C. Sansom C.E. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 817-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 17Jackson V.N. Price N.T. Carpenter L. Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 447-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). For preparation of plasma membranes from cell lines the initial cell disruption involved homogenization with a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer (50 strokes) followed by 20 passes through a fine (25-gauge) gauge needle. Where required, denervation or chronic stimulation of rat hind limb muscles was performed as described previously (4McCullagh K.J.A. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Tipton K.F. OBrien M. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E239-E246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Pilegaard H. Juel C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E679-E682PubMed Google Scholar); the procedures had received ethical approval by the relevant committees. An untreated contralateral limb always acted as a control for the treated limb of the same animal. Muscles were dissected out, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. Samples of muscle (40 mg) were homogenized (Polytron 2100, 2 × 30 s on maximum setting) in 1 ml of buffer (250 mm sucrose, 30 mm HEPES, 2 mm EGTA, 40 mm NaCl, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4). After centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, the pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of Tris-SDS (10 mm Tris, 4% (w/v) SDS, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and homogenized (2 × 15 s with a Polytron). Following protein determination (Bio-Rad, detergent-compatible protein assay), samples were diluted to 2 mg of protein/ml and an equal volume of sample buffer added. Samples (20 μl) were then subjected to SDS-PAGE (8–18% gradient gel) and Western blotting as above. Quantification was performed by scanning the film and analysis of band intensities with “Band Leader”, a shareware program. As described previously (3McCullagh K.J.A. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. OBrien M. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E143-E150PubMed Google Scholar), by using increasing concentrations of homogenate it was confirmed that in all cases protein loading was such that the response of the film was linear with respect to the amount of MCT present. Samples of contralateral control muscle homogenates were analyzed on the same gel as samples (containing the same amount of protein) from denervated or chronically contracting muscles. Skeletal muscles were dissected from the hind limbs of freshly killed rats under a relaxing solution (127 mmKCH3SO4, 13 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) before preparation of frozen sections (10 μm), while isolated cardiac myocytes were added directly to polylysine-coated coverslips. Unless otherwise stated, all subsequent protocols were carried out in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.3. Staining of sections for succinate dehydrogenase was performed as described by Spurway et al. (25Spurway N.C. Murray M.G. Gilmour W.H. Montgomery I. J. Anat. 1996; 188: 455-472PubMed Google Scholar). For immunohistochemistry fixation was with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilization with 0.3% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 45 s. Nonspecific binding of antibody was reduced by blocking for 60 min with 10% (v/v) normal swine serum. Incubation with primary antibody (1 in 100) supplemented with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin was for 45 min. Following three washes in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, samples were again blocked with normal swine serum before addition of rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and incubation for 45 min at room temperature. After washing, samples were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) and examined with a Leica TCS-NT confocal scanning microscope (63 × 1.32Na oil immersion objective). After washing twice with PBS, cells were detatched from the culture flasks by incubation with trypsin solution (Sigma) for 5 min (COS) or 30 min (NBL1), followed by inactivation of the trypsin with PBS containing 10% (w/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and once in transport buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 3.3 mm MOPS, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) before incubating in transport buffer containing 5 μm BCECF/AM (Boehringer Mannheim) for 20 min at room temperature. Loaded cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended to about 5.107cells/ml in transport buffer. A sample (10 μl) of these cells was then placed in a 50-μl perspex incubation chamber on polylysine-coated coverslips, held in a thermostatically controlled incubation vessel attached to the stage of a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope. After allowing cells to fix to the coverslip for 5 min, unattached cells were washed away by flowing buffer at 2 ml/min through the incubation chamber. Buffer inflow was regulated by an eight-roller peristaltic pump and outflow by a second pump removing buffer from the distal end of the incubation chamber so as to maintain a constant volume. The objective was then focused on a suitable group of cells, of which four to six cells were selected with a rectangular diaphragm. Measurement of changes in BCECF fluorescence was made with a Cairn Instruments spinning wheel fluorescence attachment with excitation at 440 and 490 nm and emission at >510 nm as described previously (8Wang X.M. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1759-H1769PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H476-H484PubMed Google Scholar). The filter wheel was rotated at 32 rpm and data averaged to display 2 data points/s. Changes of substrate and inhibitor concentration were enabled by rapid switching (solenoid valves) between solutions from eight thermostatically controlled vessels containing buffer with the required additions. If desired, solutions could be mixed in any combination before delivery to the incubation vessel. Complete change of substrate or inhibitor concentration within any point of the incubation vessel took <1 s, allowing accurate measurement of initial rates of transport. Antipeptide antibodies to the C terminus of human MCT3 have been raised and used in Western blotting to determine the presence of MCT3 in plasma membranes from various rat and human tissues. Data are shown in Fig. 1. We subsequently cloned and sequenced rat MCT3 cDNA 2V. N. Jackson, N. T. Price, and A. P. Halestrap, unpublished data (GenBank™ Accession numberU87627). and confirmed that it exhibited 100% identity over the region against which the antibody was raised. MCT3 was detected in plasma membranes from rat hind limb muscle (primarily white muscle), which contained very little MCT1. In contrast no MCT3 was detected in membranes from rat liver and heart or from brain, kidney, and testis (data not shown), all of which contained large amounts of MCT1. In available human tissues we found MCT3 in membrane preparations from heart, placenta, and white blood cells (Fig. 1), whereas MCT1 was detected only in membranes from heart. In all cases care was taken to inhibit proteases that might destroy the epitope detected by the antibody, and thus, the absence of a particular MCT in the membrane preparations appears to be real. The lack of MCT3 in rat heart is puzzling in view of its presence in human heart, but the result was confirmed using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy of isolated rat heart cells. This readily visualized the presence of MCT1, especially in the intercalated disk and T-tubular regions as reported previously (11Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 26Johannsson E. Nagelhus E.A. McCullagh K.J.A. Sejersted O.M. Blackstad T.W. Bonen A. Ottersen O.P. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), while detecting no specific binding of the MCT3 antibody (data not shown). Skeletal muscles are often referred to as either white or red depending on their myoglobin and mitochondrial content. More precisely, muscle fibers may be divided into three groups. Fast-twitch glycolytic (FG) fibers have few mitochondria and are almost exclusively glycolytic in their energy metabolism. Fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibers (FOG) have more mitochondria and are both oxidative and glycolytic, while slow-twitch oxidative fibers (SO) have the highest mitochondrial content and are specialized for oxidative energy metabolism (2Juel C. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 321-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). MCT1 expression in individual muscles correlates with their mitochondrial content, suggesting that its expression may reflect the need to transport lactic acid into the cell for oxidation (3McCullagh K.J.A. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. OBrien M. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: E143-E150PubMed Google Scholar). In Fig. 2 we report the MCT1 and MCT3 content of different muscle types, measured by immunoblotting of homogenates of individual rat muscles. Unlike MCT1, MCT3 was found to be expressed to a similar extent in almost all muscle types irrespective of their fiber content. An exception was soleus muscle, which contains mainly SO fibers, where MCT3 expression was found to be significantly lower. These data were confirmed with immunofluorescence confocal microscopy using specific MCT1 and MCT3 antibodies. Data are shown in Fig. 3 for four rat muscles, white gastrocnemius (16% FOG and 84% FG), semimembranosis (7% SO, 43% FOG, 50% FG), semitendinosis (7% SO, 45% FOG, 48% FG), and soleus (87% SO, 13% FOG). Muscle sections were also stained for succinate dehydrogenase, and data are shown for soleus and semitendinosis. These data confirm that all fibers in the soleus, but only the small fibers in the semitendinosis and semimembranosis, have high oxidative capacity, and these were also the fibers that expressed most MCT1.Figure 3The localization of MCT1 and MCT3 in different muscle fiber types. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy with anti-MCT1 and -MCT3 antibodies was performed on frozen muscle sections as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In the top panel a lower magnification is used to allow display of a larger field of cells. This panel also includes sections stained with succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to visualize the mitochondrial content of the different fibers. Some shrinkage is occurred during preparation of the soleus section.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We have previously shown that chronic electrical stimulation of rat hind limb muscles for 7 days produced a 2–3-fold increase in MCT1 expression in the red and white tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus muscles (4McCullagh K.J.A. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Tipton K.F. OBrien M. Bonen A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: E239-E246Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, with the same experimental treatment we have found no significant change in MCT3 expression (data not shown). In contrast, the data of Fig. 4 show that denervation for 3 weeks gave a significant decrease in MCT3 expression (expressed per mg of total homogenate protein) in soleus (56.1 ± 5.8%), red gastrocnemius (39.8 ± 7.9%), white gastrocnemius (52.6 ± 11.4%), and white tibialis anterior (56.0 ± 7.7%) muscles. A smaller decrease (10–20%, but not statistically significant) was observed after only 3 days denervation. MCT1 expression also decreased significantly after 3 weeks denervation in soleus (52.6 ± 7.0%) and red gastrocnemius (60.8 ± 11.5%) muscles, while expression in white gastrocnemius and white tibialis anterior muscles was too low to detect any further decrease. In earlier experiments we demonstrated that after 3 weeks denervation the rate of lactate transport out of giant sarcolemmal vesicles prepared from white gastrocnemius, red gastrocnemius, and soleus decreased by 36, 41, and 50%, respectively (5Pilegaard H. Juel C. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: E679-E682PubMed Google Scholar). In order to characterize the kinetics of MCT3, it is necessary to express the active protein in a cell line that contains no endogenous MCT activity. We have been unable to find such a mammalian cell line; indeed, even the human breast tumor cell line used by Garcia et al. (11Garcia C.K. Goldstein J.L. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Brown M.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 865-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) to express MCT1 has significant endogenous MCT activity (data not shown). This is not surprising since all mammalian cells are partially glycolytic and many immortal cells exclusively so, necessitating rapid rates of lactic acid efflux (1Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C761-C782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast it has been reported that some insect cell lines do lack MCT activity (16Garcia C.K. Brown M.S. Pathak R.K. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1843-1849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and we have confirmed this for Spodoptera f21 and DrosophilaSchneider cells. However, we have been unsuccessful in establishing a stable MCT3-transfected insect cell line using a variety of expression vectors. Thus we decided to look for a mammalian cell line that expressed MCT3 but no other MCT isoform. For this purpose we screened a range of cell lines using Western blotting with antipeptide antibodies that we have raised against C-terminal peptide sequences specific for each of the different MCT isoforms. As shown in Fig. 1 we have confirmed that mouse ELT tumor cells express only MCT1 as suggested by our previous studies (14Carpenter L. Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1279: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), while the bovine kidney cell line NBL1 express only MCT3. Although not shown in Fig. 1 we have also been unable to detect any protein reacting with antipeptide antibodies we have raised to MCT2, MCT4, MCT5, MCT6, or MCT7 in either ELT or NBL1 cells. The COS cell line derived from monkey kidney also appeared to express mainly MCT3. However, the MCT1 antibody did give a faint band of about 43 kDa and also an additional band of about 85 kDa, both of which were abolished in the presence of MCT1 peptide. Thus it is likely that significant amounts of MCT1 are present in COS cells, the 85-kDa band probably reflecting dimeric MCT1, since this protein is known to aggregate in detergent (27Poole R.C. Halestrap A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14624-14628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For each of these three cell lines monocarboxylate transport was measured using the intracellular pH-sensitive fluorescent dye, BCECF, which detects the rapid decrease in pHi that accompanies proton-linked transport (8Wang X.M. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: H1759-H1769PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang X. Levi A.J. Halestrap A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H476-H484PubMed Google Scholar, 10Jackson V.N.

J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Data are shown in Fig. 5. Measurement of the true initial rate of fluorescence change was possible by fitting the curve to a first order uptake equation and subsequently converted into a rate of monocarboxylate transport in nanomoles per μl intracellular volume per minute (10Jackson V.N.

J. 1994; 304: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The latter calculation required measurement of the pH gradient across the plasma membrane (0.1 pH units acid inside) determined using butyrate and trimethylamine and the total change in fluorescence ratio induced by increasing l-lactate concentrations once equilibrium had been reached. For each cell type, initial rates of monocarboxylate transport were measured on three or four different fields of cells at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 mml-lactate, d-lactate, and pyruvate. Results are summarized in Fig. 6 and the derived K mand V max values presented in TableI.Figure 6The substrate concentration dependence of monocarboxylate transport into COS, NBL1, and ELT cells.

The driving force for uptake on oatp1 has not been identified, although a role for bicarbonate has recently been proposed. The present study examined whether oatp1-mediated uptake is energized by efflux (countertransport) of intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH), and whether hydrophobic glutathioneS-conjugates such as leukotriene C4(LTC4) and S-dinitrophenyl glutathione (DNP-SG) form a novel class of substrates for oatp1. Xenopus laevisoocytes injected with the complementary RNA for oapt1 demonstrated higher uptake of 10 nm [3H]LTC4and 50 μm [3H]DNP-SG, and higher efflux of [3H]GSH (2.5 mm endogenous intracellular GSH concentration). The oatp1-stimulated LTC4 and DNP-SG uptake was independent of the Na+ gradient,cis-inhibited by known substrates of this transport protein and by 1 mm GSH, and was saturable, with apparentK m values of 0.27 ± 0.06 and 408 ± 95 μm, respectively. Uptake of [3H]taurocholate, an endogenous substrate of oatp1, was competitively inhibited by DNP-SG. Of significance, oatp1-mediated taurocholate and LTC4 uptake was cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated by GSH, and [3H]GSH efflux was enhanced in the presence of extracellular taurocholate or sulfobromophthalein, indicating that GSH efflux down its large electrochemical gradient provides the driving force for uptake via oatp1. The stoichiometry of GSH/taurocholate exchange was 1:1. These findings identify a new class of substrates for oatp1 and provide evidence for GSH-dependent oatp1-mediated substrate transport. oatp1 is an hepatic sinusoidal organic anion transporter that mediates uptake of various structurally unrelated organic compounds from blood.

A major hepatic function is the clearance of a multitude of metabolic products and foreign compounds (xenobiotics) from the blood. Hepatic uptake of organic solutes across the sinusoidal membrane is mediated by multiple transport systems, and four transporters have now been cloned. Ntcp mediates Na+-coupled transport of bile acids (1Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Foguet M. Lubbert H. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10629-10633Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar), oct1 mediates H+-coupled uptake of organic cations (2Gründemann D. Gorboulev V. Gambaryan S. Veyhl M. Koepsell H. Nature. 1994; 372: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar), and oatp1 and oatp2 are related multispecific transporters for which driving force has not yet been identified (3Jacquemin E.

A. 1997; 94: 10346-10350Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). A recent study indicates that HCO3− efflux may be involved in oatp1-mediated transport (6Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26340-26345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar); however, because intracellular pH is lower than extracellular pH, the HCO3− gradient is unlikely to energize transport of organic anions on oatp1. Indeed, Satlin and co-workers (6Satlin L.M. Amin V. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26340-26345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) demonstrated that oatp1-mediated cellular uptake of taurocholate was accelerated only when the pH gradient was reversed from the normal physiological condition. Under all other pH gradient conditions examined by these investigators, taurocholate uptake was lower than that seen in controls, contradicting the hypothesis that the bicarbonate gradient energizes oatp1-mediated transport. oatp1-mediated transport is independent of ATP and of transmembrane Na+, K+, or H+ gradients (3Jacquemin E.

Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). However, oatp1-mediated transport is bidirectional (7Shi X. Bai S. Ford A.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that solute uptake may be energized by efflux of an intracellular solute. Whether oatp1 actually functions as an antiporter (exchanger) and which intracellular solute may be involved remain to be established. One solute that could function as an intracellular substrate for oatp1 and related organic anion transporters is reduced glutathione (GSH). This anionic tripeptide is present in high concentrations in virtually all cells, including hepatocytes (∼10 mm), whereas plasma concentrations are only about 10 μm (8Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9DeLeve L.D. Kaplowitz N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 10Lee T.K. Li L. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). The high GSH chemical gradient coupled with the negative intracellular membrane potential could provide a substantial driving force for uptake via oatp1. Export of GSH into the extracellular space is the initial and perhaps limiting step in the turnover of the tripeptide in all mammalian cells (8Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1985; 25: 715-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9DeLeve L.D. Kaplowitz N. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 52: 287-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 10Lee T.K. Li L. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar); however, the transport system or systems that mediate GSH efflux have not been identified. The previously reported cloning of sinusoidal and canalicular GSH transporters has not been confirmed (14Li L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar) and appears to be an artifact (10Lee T.K. Li L. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar, 14Li L. Lee T.K. Ballatori N. Yale J. Biol. Med.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Rates of GSH efflux differ between cell types and are roughly equivalent to the rates of synthesis under physiological conditions. The liver is quantitatively the major site of synthesis in the body, and the major supplier of plasma GSH (8Kaplowitz N. Aw T.Y. Ookhtens M. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

Yale J. Biol. Med.,. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Studies in intact hepatocytes and isolated sinusoidal plasma membrane vesicles indicate that GSH efflux is mediated by a low affinity, ATP-independent, electrogenic carrier (11Garcia-Ruiz C.

Transport is bidirectional, although under physiological conditions unidirectional transport down its concentration gradient is favored, i.e.efflux of GSH from hepatocytes (11Garcia-Ruiz C.

The present study also examined whether leukotriene C4(LTC4) 1The abbreviations used are: LTC4, leukotriene C4; BSP, bromosulfophthalein; BSP-SG, glutathione S-conjugate of BSP; DNP-SG,S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione; cRNA, complementary RNA. is a substrate for oatp1. The cysteinyl leukotrienes are potent mediators of inflammatory responses (15Henderson W.R. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 121: 684-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar), and the liver is the major site of their removal from the blood (15Henderson W.R. Ann. Intern.

Biochem. 1990; 191: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mechanism for their hepatic uptake is unknown, although evidence from isolated hepatocytes and perfused rat liver studies indicate that uptake is mediated by oapt1 (17Wettstein M. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Wettstein M. Gerok W. Häussinger D. Eur. J.

LTC4 uptake into isolated rat hepatocytes and plasma membrane vesicles is independent of the Na+ gradient, is inhibited by substrates of oatp1, and exhibits an apparentK m of 0.20 μm (19Leier I. Muller M. Jedlitschky G. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Once taken up into hepatocytes, LTC4 is transported across the canalicular membrane into bile by the ATP-dependent transporter mrp2 (which is also called cMRP or cMOAT). Hepatic uptake of another glutathione S-conjugate (2,4-dinitrophenyl-glutathione, DNP-SG) also displays characteristics of oatp1-mediated transport (20Hinchman C.A. Truong A.T. Ballatori N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: G547-G554PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the hypothesis that oatp1 mediates uptake of these glutathione S-conjugates, the present study measured LTC4 and DNP-SG uptake in Xenopus laevis oocytes injected with oatp1 complementary RNA (cRNA). The results demonstrate that LTC4 and DNP-SG are substrates for this multispecific organic solute transporter, and that hepatic uptake is energized by countertransport of intracellular GSH.

Animals were maintained under a constant light cycle at a room temperature of 18 °C.

It was purified on a 1 × 8-cm DEAE-Sephadex A25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), eluted with 25 mm Tris (Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 43 ml/h. Fractions containing [3H]DNP-SG were concentrated on a vacuum evaporator (Jouan, Winchester, VA). The final concentration of Tris buffer in the isotope solution was ∼150 mm after concentration. Purity of [3H]DNP-SG was confirmed with the high performance liquid chromatography method of Farris and Reed (24Farris M.W. Reed D.J.

Capped cRNA was transcribed in vitro with T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Ambion, Austin, TX), and the reactions were terminated by digestion of the DNA templates with RNase-free DNase I. cRNAs were precipitated with lithium chloride and stored at −70 °C until used for oocyte microinjection. Total RNA from rat liver was prepared using the guanidinium thiocyanate/cesium chloride method (25Snutch T.P. Mandel G.

Oocytes were removed from the ovary and washed with Ca2+-free OR-2 solution (in mm: 82.5 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1 MgCl2, and HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5) and incubated at room temperature with gentle shaking for 90 min in OR-2 solution supplemented with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma type IA). Oocytes were transferred to fresh collagenase solution after the first 45 min of incubation. Collagenase was removed by extensive washing in OR-2 solution at room temperature. Stage V and VI defolliculated oocytes were selected and incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution (in mm: 88 NaCl, 1 KCl, 2.4 NaHCO3, 0.82 MgSO4, 0.33 Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 CaCl2, and 20 HEPES-Tris, pH 7.5), supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml) and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). After 3–4 h of incubation, healthy oocytes were injected with 50 nl of oatp1 cRNA (0.5–10 ng/oocyte), 50 nl of Ntcp cRNA (0.5 ng/oocyte), or 50 ng of rat liver mRNA. Control oocytes were injected with a corresponding volume of sterile H2O. Injected oocytes were cultured at 18 °C with a daily change of modified Barth's medium. Healthy oocytes with a clean brown animal half and a distinct equator line were selected for experiments. Uptake studies were performed 2–3 days after microinjection. Oocytes were pretreated with 0.5 mmacivicin for 30 min at room temperature to inhibit γ-glutamyl transpeptidase activity. For uptake measurement, 6–8 oocytes were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h in 100 μl of modified Barth's solution, in the presence of 1 μCi of [3H]DNP-SG (or [3H]LTC4) and 0.5 mm acivicin (27Ballatori N. Wang W. Li L. Truong A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R1156-R1162PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake was stopped by adding 2.5 ml of ice-cold modified Barth's solution and oocytes washed three times each with 2.5 ml of ice-cold modified Barth's solution. Two oocytes each were dissolved in a polypropylene scintillation vial with 0.2 ml of 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and counted in a Packard model 4530 scintillation spectrometer after addition of 5 ml of Opti-Fluor (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). Oocytes were injected with either 0.5 ng of Ntcp cRNA or oatp1 cRNA. Na+-dependent taurocholate (10 μm) uptake was determined at 25 °C in 100 μl in modified Barth's solution, supplemented with 2.1–3.5 μCi of [3H]taurocholate. Uptake was terminated by addition of ice-cold stop solution, which was modified Barth's solution containing 1 mm unlabeled taurocholate in order to reduce unspecific binding of tracer taurocholate (28Hagenbuch B. Lubbert H. Stieger B. Meier P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5357-5360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibitors were dissolved in the uptake buffer at the indicated concentrations. Oocytes injected with either water or oatp1 cRNA were reinjected with 50 nl of [3H]GSH (0.5–1 μCi/μl) and allowed to recover for 30 min in modified Barth's solution with 0.5 mm acivicin. Oocytes were washed twice with 2.5 ml of modified Barth's solution prior to efflux studies. Efflux was measured at 25 °C in 200 μl of modified Barth's solution in the presence or absence of 50 mm GSH, 50 μm taurocholate, or 1 μm BSP. Efflux was terminated at 5, 20, or 65 min by removing the medium and counting it separately from the oocytes. The 5-min values were used as a background correction and were subtracted from the 20- and 65-min values to give 15- and 60-min efflux rates. To increase GSH, oocytes were injected with 50 nl of different GSH stock solutions (e.g. 220 mm GSH stock, for an increase of ∼20 mm in the oocytes). Oocytes were incubated at 25 °C for approximately 30 min before they were used in the experiment. To decrease GSH, oocytes were incubated in modified Barth's solution containing 5 mm buthionine sulfoximine and 5 μm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene for 18 h prior to uptake experiments. GSH content of the oocyte was measured as described previously (27Ballatori N. Wang W. Li L. Truong A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R1156-R1162PubMed Google Scholar). X. laevis oocytes injected with the cRNA for either oatp1 or Ntcp, the Na+-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, showed enhanced uptake of taurocholate (Fig. 1 A), confirming previous results (1Hagenbuch B.

Hepatology. 1994; 20: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with oatp1 cRNA also demonstrated enhanced uptake of 10 nm LTC4 and 50 μm DNP-SG, when compared with oocytes injected with water or total liver mRNA (Fig. 1 B); however, the extent of stimulation of LTC4 and DNP-SG transport was lower than that of taurocholate. In contrast, oocytes injected with Ntcp-cRNA did not show enhanced transport of these glutathioneS-conjugates (Fig. 1 B). The oatp1-mediated uptake of [3H]LTC4 and [3H]DNP-SG increased with time over a 4-h interval (Fig. 2), and was independent of extracellular Na+ and Cl− concentrations (Fig. 3). Uptake was unaffected when Na+ in the culture medium was replaced with choline+, or when Cl− was replaced with gluconate− (Fig. 3). Isosmotic replacement of NaCl with sucrose also failed to affect LTC4 and DNP-SG uptake. These results with LTC4 and DNP-SG are similar to those reported previously for taurocholate and BSP transport on oatp1 (3Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W. Meier P.J. Proc. Natl.

Oocytes were injected with either 50 nl of water or 5 ng of oatp1 cRNA. All values are means ± S.E. of three oocyte preparations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The concentration dependence of uptake was examined in oocytes incubated with increasing concentrations of LTC4 (10 nm to 500 nm) and DNP-SG (1 μm to 1 mm), (Fig. 4). It was not possible to examine lower concentrations of LTC4 because of limitations imposed by the specific activity of the isotope, nor was it feasible to examine higher LTC4 concentrations due to its limited solubility in aqueous medium. Uptake of LTC4 and DNP-SG was saturable, with apparent K m values of 0.27 ± 0.06 and 408 ± 95 μm (mean ± S.D.), and V max values of 40 ± 35 fmol·oocyte−1·h−1 and 4.7 ± 0.9 pmol·oocyte−1·h−1, respectively (Fig. 4). This K m value for LTC4 in oatp1-expressing oocytes is comparable to that measured in isolated rat hepatocytes, 0.20 μm (19Leier I. Muller M. Jedlitschky G. Keppler D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 209: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for oatp1 in mediating LTC4 uptake. Inhibition experiments revealed that BSP, taurocholate, and bilirubin ditaurate, substrates for oatp1, are strong inhibitors of LTC4 and DNP-SG transport in oocytes injected with oatp1 cRNA (Table I). Conversely, DNP-SG inhibited [3H]taurocholate uptake, and the inhibition was competitive in nature (Fig. 5). TheK m for taurocholate uptake in the absence of DNP-SG was 38 ± 8 μm (mean ± S.D., n= 3; Fig. 5), a value comparable to that reported previously (3Jacquemin E. Hagenbuch B. Stieger B. Wolkoff A.W.

Hepatology. 1994; 20: 411-416PubMed Google Scholar). The K m was increased to 88 ± 18 μm in the presence of 100 μm DNP-SG, whereas the V max was unchanged (3.5 ± 0.4 and 4.7 ± 1.5 pmol·oocyte−1.h−1, respectively; Fig. 5), indicating competitive inhibition. Mutual inhibition of transport provides strong evidence for a shared transport system.Table Icis-Inhibition of LTC4 and DNP-SG uptake into X. laevis oocytes expressing oatp1Test compoundAmount of compoundUptake[3H]LTC4 (10 nm)[3H]DNP-SG (50 μm)μm% controlOrganic anions DIDS25025 ± 1639 ± 15 BSP250<2<2 Bilirubin ditaurate5004 ± 26 ± 10 Taurocholate25011 ± 215 ± 13GSH and glutathione S-conjugates GSH100055 ± 476 ± 19 GSSG100085 ± 15113 ± 23 LTC40.554 ± 1572 ± 12 DNP-SG100015 ± 729 ± 9 p-Chlorophenacyl-SG100023 ± 2031 ± 18 BSP-SG50043 ± 670 ± 21Neutral compound Ouabain50052 ± 1161 ± 9Oocytes were injected with either water or oatp1 cRNA (5 ng/oocyte for LTC4 and 0.5 ng/oocyte for DNP-SG).

Uptake was measured under conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are means ± S.D. of three or four oocyte preparations, and are corrected for water-injected oocytes. All results are significantly different from control (p < 0.01, using unpaired Student'st test), except GSSG. 4,4′-Diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, ouabain, and other glutathione S-conjugates such as BSP-SG (0.5 mm) and S-(p-chlorophenacyl)-glutathione (1 mm) also inhibited uptake of LTC4 and DNP-SG (Table I). LTC4 uptake was decreased to 43% and 23% of control in the presence of BSP-SG andS-(p-chlorophenacyl)-glutathione, respectively. DNP-SG uptake was also inhibited by these glutathioneS-conjugates, but the extent of inhibition was lower (TableI). These data indicate that bulky glutathione S-conjugates may be substrates for oatp1. Of significance, 1 mm GSH cis-inhibited LTC4 and DNP-SG uptake, suggesting that GSH itself may be a substrate for oatp1 (Table I). Extracellular GSH (1 mm) also inhibited 1 μm [3H]taurocholate uptake by 36 ± 16% (mean ± S.D.; n = 6). However, GSSG (1 mm) did not have any significant effect (TableI). To test the possibility that GSH is a substrate for oatp1, [3H]GSH efflux was measured in oocytes expressing oatp1. The endogenous GSH transport rate in oocytes was high (TableII), as reported previously (27Ballatori N. Wang W. Li L. Truong A.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R1156-R1162PubMed Google Scholar), but was even higher in oatp1-expressing oocytes (Table II), consistent with the hypothesis that GSH is transported on oatp1. The presence of 50 mm unlabeled GSH in the efflux medium further accelerated [3H]GSH efflux in both control and oatp1-expressing oocytes (Table II).Table II[3H]GSH efflux in oatp1-expressing oocytes incubated in modified Barth's solution in the presence and absence of 50 mm GSH, 50 μm taurocholate, or 1 μm BSPEfflux media[3H]GSH released in 1 hH2O-injectedcRNA-injectedcRNA-H2O%%%Modified Barth's solution3.35 ± 0.214.38 ± 0.48*1.03 ± 0.15 +50 mm GSH4.39 ± 0.595.66 ± 0.44*1.27 ± 0.24[3H]GSH released in 15 minH2O-injectedcRNA-injectedcRNA-H2O%%%Modified Barth's solution0.98 ± 0.031.26 ± 0.060.27 ± 0.04 +50 μmtaurocholate0.94 ± 0.041.40 ± 0.040.46 ± 0.10** +1 μm BSP0.76 ± 0.071.19 ± 0.090.43 ± 0.07**To examine the effects of 50 mm GSH, oocytes injected with either water or 2 ng of oatp1 cRNA were re-injected with 50 nl of [3H]GSH (0.5–1 μCi/μl, tracer concentration) and allowed to recover for 30 min in modified Barth's solution with 0.5 mm acivicin.

MMPs are produced as a zymogen (proMMP) that needs proteolytic activation by eliminating the N-terminal propeptide for the enzymes to function (7Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5578-5582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Serine proteases such as plasmin, neutrophil elastase, and trypsin are well known activators for proMMPs. These activators digest the propeptide sequences at the basic amino acid motifs and eventually induce autocatalytic activation (8Nagase H. Ogata Y. Suzuki K. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1991; 19: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, proGelA lacks such a basic motif and therefore cannot be activated by serine proteinases (9Okada Y. Morodomi T.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Upon cell-mediated activation, proGelA binds to the cells through its hemopexin-like domain (HLD) (22Ward R.V. Atkinson S.J. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. Biochem. J. 1994; 267: 263-269Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Using the HLD of GelA, Stronginet al. (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) isolated TIMP-2 complexed with the activated form of MT1-MMP from the cell membrane extract. We also purified a shaded fragment of MT1-MMP from the culture medium of the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231 as a form inhibited by TIMP-2 (24Imai K. Ohuchi E. Aoki T. Nomura H. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2707-2710PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of the TIMP-2 in the complex was available for further complex formation with proGelA through its HLD (trimolecular complex). Strongin et al. also demonstrated that a small amount of TIMP-2 is an essential component for the activation of proGelA on the surface, in contrast to evidence that TIMP-2 is a well established inhibitor for all of the known MMPs. It would thus be of interest to clarify the discrepancy that TIMP-2 is an inhibitor of MT1-MMP on one hand but also a stimulator for proGelA processing on the other hand. Although TIMP-2 mediates formation of a trimolecular complex by binding both proGelA and MT1-MMP, its relevance to proGelA processing on the cell surface was not clear, because the catalytic function of MT1-MMP in the complex is inhibited by the TIMP-2. In previous studies, the recombinant catalytic fragment of MT1-MMP expressed in Escherichia coli was sufficient to cleave the propeptide sequence of proGelA and trigger its autocatalytic activationin vitro (25Pei D.Q.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, unlike the cell-mediated activation, the in vitro reaction with recombinant enzymes did not require TIMP-2 for proGelA activation. TIMP-2 inhibited the reaction in a dose-dependent manner, and no stimulation was observed at any concentration range. Also, the HLD of proGelA that was essential for cell-mediated activation was not required for this reaction. Thus, the in vitro reaction was thought to lack an important element of the cell surface event. The difference may be caused by the HLD of MT1-MMP which was deleted in the recombinant enzymes or by the transmembrane domain that links the enzyme on the cell surface, or some important factors included in the crude preparations were missing in the assay. In the present study, we attempted to clarify the role of TIMP-2 in the cell-mediated processing of proGelA. For this purpose, we expressed different forms of recombinant MT1-MMP fragment with or without the HLD as fusion proteins with FLAG-tag at the C terminus that was used to immobilize the enzymes on the agarose beads through anti-FLAG antibody. The recombinant enzymes immobilized on the beads were used to mimic the cell surface situation. Fragments of MT1-MMP cDNA encoding amino acid Ala113–Gly535 (MT1, Fig. 1 A) or Ala113–Gly284(MT1dH, Fig. 1) were amplified by a polymerase chain reaction using 5′- and 3′-primers with additional HindIII and SalI sites at the ends, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with these enzymes and subcloned into the pFLAG-CTC vector (IHI, New Haven, CT), which directed expression of the peptide encoded by the cloned fragment as a FLAG-tagged fusion protein in E. coli. Plasmids that express proGelA and its mutant lacking a hemopexin-like domain (proGelA/dHLD, Fig. 1) were described previously (29Sato H. Takino T. Kinoshita T. Imai K. Okada Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

The truncated form of TIMP-2 (Met1–Arg158, Fig. 1) was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using polymerase chain reaction-amplified cDNA cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pSG5 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The recombinant MT1-MMP proteins were expressed in E. coli, strain XL1-Blue (Stratagene), according to the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, fresh overnight cultures of E. coliharboring recombinant plasmids were diluted to 1:100 and were grown at 37 °C with shaking to an optical density 0.5 (atA 600). The culture was then treated with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for an additional 1 h. Cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended with TBS buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton X-100 and then lysed by sonication. The supernatant of the lysate was collected and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity beads (IHI) and rocked for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with TBS buffer containing 0.1% Lubrol (TBSL) and suspended with TBSL containing 50% glycerol. Aliquots were taken into microtubes and stored at −80 °C until use. The proteins were analyzed by electrophoresis in 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. ProGelA and the truncated TIMP-2 mutant were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells by transfection of the genes, and purified from the culture supernatant as described previously (9Okada Y. Morodomi T. Enghild J.J. Suzuki K. Yasui A. Nakanishi I. Salvesen G. Nagase H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). ProGelA/dH was purified from the culture supernatant of COS-1 cells transfected with an expression vector (15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant TIMP-2 was a gift from Dr. K. Iwata (Fuji Chemical Industries Ltd., Takaoka, Japan). The concentrations of MT1-F, MT1dH-F, proGelA, and proGelA/dHLD were determined by titration of their activities against recombinant TIMP-2 using Mca-Pro-Leu-Gly-Leu-Dpa-Ala-Arg-NH2 (Peptide Institute Inc., Osaka, Japan) (31Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The TIMP-2 concentration was determined by amino acid analysis (32Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Recombinant MT1-MMPs (20 ng for MT1-F/B and 10 ng for MT-1dH-F/B) were incubated with 1 ng of proGelA or proGelA/dHLD at 37 °C in the presence of various concentrations of TIMP-2 (in 10 μl of reaction mixture). The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 62 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.1% bromphenol blue) and analyzed by gelatin zymography. In some cases, complex formation was carried out by incubating the reaction mixture at 0 °C, and then processing was initiated by shifting the incubation temperature up to 37 °C. Gelatin zymography was performed as described elsewhere (16Sato H. Takino T. Okada Y. Cao J. Shinagawa A. Yamamoto E. Seiki M. Nature. 1994; 370: 61-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2373) Google Scholar). Samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer in the absence of a reducing agent, incubated for 20 min at 37 °C, and separated on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were soaked in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and then gelatinolysis was permitted by incubating the gel in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% NaN3 at 37 °C for 24 h. The gel was stained with 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, and the location of gelatinolytic activity was detected as clear bands in the background of uniform staining. The signal and propeptide sequences of MT1-MMP were deleted to express the enzyme as an active form in E. coli, and its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains at the C terminus were also deleted to make it a soluble form. The recombinant enzyme was expressed as a fusion with the FLAG-tag sequence at the C terminus (MT1-F) (Fig. 1). The mutant was purified using anti-FLAG antibody immobilized on agarose beads, and thus MT1-F immobilized on the beads was prepared (MT1-F/B). Another mutant enzyme that lacks the HLD of MT1-F (MT1dH-F) was similarly expressed and purified. The analysis of the purified enzymes by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated 48 kDa for MT1-F and 22 kDa for MT1dH-F, as shown in Fig. 2 A. The 28-kDa band is the light chain of the anti-FLAG antibody. As previously reported for recombinant MT1-MMP fragments containing the catalytic domain (25Pei D.Q. Weiss S.J. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), the MT1-F/B also retained the activity to cleave the synthetic peptide substrate and was inhibited by TIMP-2 in a dose-dependent manner as in Fig. 2 B. Thus, TIMP-2 was not required for the proteolytic activity of MT1-F/B at all. TIMP-1 was not an effective inhibitor against MT1-MMP, as demonstrated previously (data not shown) (26Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar, 27Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The activity of MT1-F/B was completely inhibited by TIMP-2 at a 1.34 molar ratio (TIMP-2/MT1-F/B). TIMP-2 also inhibited MT1dH-F/B similarly (data not shown). In the previous studies, TIMP-2 was not required for proGelA processing by the soluble forms of MT1-MMP lacking the C-terminal domains. The result was the same with MT1-F/B so far as the synthetic peptide was used as a substrate. To evaluate the effect of TIMP-2 on proGelA processing by MT1-F/B, increasing doses of TIMP-2 were added to the reaction mixture containing MT1-F/B and proGelA. Processing of proGelA was monitored by electrophoresis of the reaction mixture on gelatin-containing substrate gel (zymography). Processing of proGelA was observed without TIMP-2 when high concentrations of MT1-F/B were used (data not shown). To enhance the sensitivity of detection of the TIMP-2 effect, the amount of MT1-F/B was reduced to the level with which proGelA processing occurs only weakly as shown in Fig. 3 A (lane 2). With the addition of TIMP-2, the band correspond to the intermediate form (I) of GelA was increased, indicating that the rate of proGelA processing was enhanced by TIMP-2. The maximum effect was obtained in the range of molar ratio (TIMP-2/MT1-F/B) between 0.008 and 0.24 (Fig. 3, A, lanes 4–9, and B). TIMP-2 was inhibitory at higher concentrations (lanes 10 and11). Fully activated GelA (F) was barely detected under these conditions. Thus, a TIMP-2 effect similar to that originally observed with the cell membrane fraction (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar) was reproduced with MT1-F/B. In previous studies, the catalytic fragment of MT1-MMP used for in vitro experiments did not contain the HLD (26Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2535-2538PubMed Google Scholar, 27Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smith B. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 28Lichte A. Kolkenbrock H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a possibility that the HLD of MT1-F/B is responsible for the stimulation of proGelA processing by TIMP-2. To examine this possibility, MT1dH-F/B, which lacks the HLD from MT1-F/B, was used. Reactions were carried out as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The addition of TIMP-2 to the reaction mixture clearly stimulated proGelA processing (Fig. 3, C and D), and the maximum effect was obtained at the range of molar ratio (TIMP-2/MT1dH-F/B) between 0.01 and 0.05 (lanes 4–7). Higher concentrations of TIMP-2 inhibited the reaction (lanes 10 and 11). Thus, the catalytic domain of the immobilized MT1-MMP was sufficient for the TIMP-2 effect and the HLD was not required. The HLD of proGelA was reported to be indispensable for the cell-mediated activation (15Strongin A.Y. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14033-14039Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283 (; Correction (1992) Biochem. J.284, 935): 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The HLD is known to interact with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of TIMP-2 and thus mediates the formation of proGelA/TIMP-2 complex (34Willenbrock F. Crabbe T. Slocombe P.M. Sutton C.W. Docherty A.J.

The N-terminal domain (NTD) of TIMP-2, on the other hand, is the inhibitory domain (36DeClerck Y.A. Yean T.D. Lee Y. Tomich J.M. Langley K.E. Biochem. J. 1993; : 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), such that TIMP-2 can bind both MT1-MMP and proGelA at the NTD and CTD, respectively. The resulting ternary complex is thought to be the same as that identified by Strongin et al. (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). The CTD of TIMP-2 and the HLD of proGelA were examined as to whether they affect the processing of proGelA by MT1-F/B. The NTD fragment of TIMP-2 (dTIMP-2) was prepared and added to the reaction mixture containing proGelA and MT1-F/B. Inhibitor activity of the recombinant dTIMP-2 was confirmed using the activated form of interstitial collagenase (data not shown). In contrast to the wild type TIMP-2, dTIMP-2 did not stimulate proGelA processing at any concentration range, while it inhibited the processing in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A and B,lanes 3–11). The CTD of TIMP-2 was thus indispensable for the stimulatory effect on proGelA processing. Essentially the same result was obtained when MT1dH-F/B was used (data not shown). To analyze the effect of the HLD of proGelA, a C-terminally truncated form of proGelA (proGelA/dHLD) was prepared and similarly tested. As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, the processing of proGelA/dHLD was not stimulated by TIMP-2 but rather was inhibited dose-dependently. This result indicates that the HLD of proGelA is also indispensable for the TIMP-2-dependent stimulation of proGelA processing in the beads system. Thus, the domains required for the cell-mediated processing were also required for the beads system. The beads system is thus thought to mimic the cell-mediated reaction without requiring additional factors. Domains of the proteins required for the TIMP-2-dependent stimulation of proGelA processing coincided with those required for ternary complex formation. We therefore tested whether the processing proceeds in solution or in the complex on the beads. The processing reaction was carried out as described in the legend for Fig. 3. The reaction mixture was then separated into beads and supernatant fractions by centrifugation and analyzed by gelatin zymography (Fig. 5 A–D). GelA activity was exclusively in the supernatant fraction in the absence of TIMP-2 (Fig. 5, A and C, lanes 2). Following the addition of TIMP-2, GelA bound to the beads dose-dependently (Fig. 5, A and B). The GelA in the bead fraction was in the intermediate form at low concentrations of TIMP-2 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3–9) and at higher concentrations, the processing in the bead fraction was rather inhibited (Fig. 5 A, lanes 10 and11). In contrast, processing of proGelA in the supernatant fraction was not significantly affected by TIMP-2 (Fig. 5, Cand D). Neither TIMP-1 nor dTIMP-2, which failed to promote proGelA processing, stimulated GelA binding to the beads (data not shown). We then asked whether proGelA binds to the beads first or intermediate GelA binds to the beads after processing in solution. For this purpose, complex formation and processing steps were carried out separately. First, the trimolecular complex was allowed to form on the beads by incubating the reaction mixture (at 0.2 molar ratio of TIMP-2 against MT1-F) on ice. The processing activity of MT1-F was negligible at this temperature, and the complex on the beads was isolated by centrifugation and washed. Then the beads were resuspended with the reaction buffer and incubated at 37 °C. At each time point shown in Fig. 6, the supernatant and bead fractions were separated again and analyzed by gelatin zymography. At 0-min incubation, almost all the GelA activity kept on the beads was proform (Fig. 6 A, lane 2), and no activity was detected in the supernatant (Fig. 6 B, lane 2). Processing proceeded rapidly at 37 °C, and the processed GelA appeared on the beads even at 5 min of incubation (Fig. 6 A,lane 3). A substantial amount of GelA was processed at 15 min, and the reaction was almost completed within 30 min (Fig. 6 A, lanes 4 and 5). Processed GelA was not released to the supernatant until 30 min of incubation (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3–5). A small amount of proGelA was released into the supernatant immediately after the temperature shift (Fig. 6 B, lane 3), but it did not increase thereafter. These results indicate that proGelA binds to the MT1-F on the beads and that processing proceeds in the complex on the beads. Apparently the proGelA in the complex is a better substrate for MT1-F/B than that in solution. In the previous studies, TIMP-2 inhibited the proteolytic activity of soluble forms of recombinant MT1-MMPs at all concentration ranges examined (25Pei D.Q. Weiss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9135-9140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 26Kinoshita T. Sato H. Takino T. Itoh M. Akizawa T. Seiki M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 17119-17123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 28Lichte A. Kolkenbrock H. Tschesche H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 397: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), while a titration amount of TIMP-2 was reportedly required for proGelA processing by plasma membrane preparation containing MT1-MMP (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). We thought that the TIMP-2 effect observed with the cell membrane may be reproducible when MT1-MMP was immobilized on some artificial matrix rather than in the soluble form. Immobilized enzymes are thought to be inefficient in utilizing substrates in solution compared with the soluble enzymes. Since TIMP-2 can mediate the ternary complex formation with MT1-MMP and proGelA (23Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar, 24Imai K. Ohuchi E. Aoki T. Nomura H. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2707-2710PubMed Google Scholar), TIMP-2 can recruit proGelA in the solution to the surface of the matrix after binding to the activated form of MT1-MMP. TIMP-2 is thus thought to increase the local concentration of proGelA at the enzyme site on the matrix surface. This possibility was directly assessed using recombinant MT1-F/B, proGelA and TIMP-2. Indeed, TIMP-2 promoted the proGelA binding to the MT1-F/B and its processing but only inhibited the MT1-F activity dose-dependently, as demonstrated using the synthetic peptide as a substrate. The cell surface event was thus reproduced, at least in part, using the immobilized MT1-MMP fragment and two other purified recombinant proteins, TIMP-2 and proGelA. Excessive TIMP-2 relative to MT1-F/B was inhibitory, as expected from its inhibitor nature. A maximum TIMP-2 effect was observed at the molar ratio 0.2 (TIMP-2/MT1-F/B) and 0.05 (TIMP-2/MT1dH-F/B), respectively, and the dose-response curves were bell-shaped. This indicates that the ratio of MT1-F in the complex versus the unoccupied enzyme on the beads is critical for the stimulation effect. Since the active site of the MT1-MMP in the trimolecular complex is inhibited by TIMP-2, MT1-MMP in the complex is thought to be inactive. Indeed, when the trimolecular complex was formed in the presence of an excessive amount of TIMP-2 (in this condition the majority of MT1-F/B is thought to form a complex), the processing of proGelA did not occur efficiently even after excess TIMP-2 was washed out and after prolonged incubation (data not shown). Thus, the proGelA in the trimolecular complex is thought to be processed by the neighboring free MT1-F. This idea is in agreement with the bell-shaped curve obtained for the TIMP-2 effect (Figs. 3 and 4). The requirement of domains of each component to obtain TIMP-2 stimulation also supports the above idea, because they are also the domains required for the trimolecular complex. At least two MT1-MMP molecules are thought to be required for proGelA processing; one functions as a substrate presentation complex and the other as a processing enzyme. These two components should be close in distance to each other for efficient proGelA processing to take place on the cell surface. In our beads system, this situation is thought to be accomplished by the divalent anti-FLAG antibody that was used to immobilize MT1-F on the beads. The MT1-F molecules on the two arms are adjacent to each other and are thought to facilitate proGelA processing when either one of the molecules formed a trimolecule complex and the other remained free. The processing of proGelA by MT1-MMP generates the intermediate form, and it is eventually converted into the matured form by intermolecular autocatalytic processing (29Sato H. Takino T. Kinoshita T. Imai K. Okada Y. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Seiki M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 238-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 37Atkinson S.J. Crabbe T. Cowell S. Ward R.V. Butler M.J. Sato H. Seiki M. Reynolds J.J. Murphy G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30479-30485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). For this reaction, two trimolecular complexes which hold the intermediate form of GelA should be close together. This situation may not be achieved easily with our beads system because of the lack of fluidity of the beads surface. Presumably this is why processing of the intermediate form to the fully activated form was very slow. As discussed above, at least two MT1-MMP molecules must get together for proGelA activation on the cell surface. The clustering of MT1-MMP on the cell surface is therefore thought to be an important factor regulating the rate of proGelA processing. There are many reports that concanavalin A, a multivalent lectin-like molecule, increases cell's ability to cause the activation of proGelA (10Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol.

Commun. 1996; 228: 530-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The concanavalin A effect may be mediated at least partly by the clustering of MT1-MMP on the surface, because the effect was observed with cells that express MT1-MMP, and the difference of the expression levels before and after the treatment was not enough in some cases to account for the dramatic induction of proGelA activation. Questions remain as to how the clustering of MT1-MMP is accomplished on the cell surface and how this event is regulated in the cells. Cells may localize the enzyme to a restricted area on the surface during ECM degradation. For example, invasive cells are reported to form protrusions to degrade ECM at the attachment side. Such protrusions, called invadopodia, contain proteolytic enzymes at the edge where active proteolysis is taking place (6Monsky W.L. Kelly T. Lin C.Y. Yeh Y. Stetler S.W. Mueller S.C. Chen W.T. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3159-3164PubMed Google Scholar). Both activated GelA and MT1-MMP were found to co-localize at the invadopodia (42Nakahara H. Howard L. Thompson E.W. Sato H. Seiki M. Yeh Y. Chen W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7959-7964Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) and the transmembrane/cytoplasmic portion of MT1-MMP was responsible for the invadopodial localization and degradation of the ECM at the cell's attachment site. It will be interesting to clarify how cell surface events are regulated by intracellular apparatus and signals through the cytoplasmic domain of MT1-MMP. The proposed mechanism does not exclude the possibility that other cell surface molecules participate in the proGelA processing by MT1-MMP. For example, αvβ3 integrin was proposed to be a receptor for proGelA in melanoma cells (43Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. Vonschalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetlerstevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1431) Google Scholar). It is possible that the αvβ3 in melanoma cells facilitates the formation of the trimolecular complex on the surface, or that αvβ3 itself may form a substrate presentation complex in addition to the one mediated by MT1-MMP. It is also possible that if putative TIMP-2 binding proteins exist on the cell surface and act as sites for proGelA binding after binding TIMP-2, they would also provide another substrate presentation complex. Different types of integrins or other ECM receptors may associate with MT1-MMP at the invadopodia. These associations are thought to make it easy for cells to detect the appropriate substrates in the ECM and hold them for degradation by the neighboring enzymes. These possibilities are also an open area for future study. We thank Dr. G. I. Goldberg for critical discussion and G. G. Gregorio for participation in this project at Kanazawa University.

When Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes are incubated with [10-3H]dihydroartemisinin, several malaria-specific proteins become labeled. One of these proteins is the P. falciparum translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) homolog. In vitro, dihydroartemisinin reacts covalently with recombinant TCTP in the presence of hemin. The association between drug and protein increases with increasing drug concentration, plateauing at approximately 1 drug/TCTP molecule. By Scatchard analysis, there appear to be 2 hemin binding sites on TCTP with dissociation constants of ∼18 μm. When the single cysteine moiety is blocked by pretreatment with iodoacetamide, hemin binding is not affected, whereas drug binding is reduced by two-thirds. Thus, TCTP reacts with artemisinin in situ and in vitro in the presence of hemin and appears to bind to hemin. The function of the malarial TCTP and the role of this reaction in the mechanism of action of artemisinin await elucidation. Artemisinin and its derivatives are important new antimalarial drugs.

Because these drugs are structurally unrelated to the classical quinoline and antifolate antimalarials, there is little or no cross-resistance. Endoperoxide antimalarials such as artemether and artesunate (see Fig. 1) are the first-line agents when multidrug-resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum appear, such as in Southeast Asia (reviewed in Ref. 1Meshnick S.R. Taylor T.E. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 301-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Artemisinin (qinghaosu) (Fig. 1), the first drug of this class, was originally identified as a component of a Chinese herbal remedy. Artemisinin derivatives have been used to treat malaria in over 2 million people in Asia. Like quinoline antimalarials, artemisinin appears to be selectively toxic to malaria parasites by interacting with heme, a byproduct of hemoglobin digestion, which is present in the parasite in high amounts. It has been proposed that intraparasitic heme activates artemisinin into a carbon-centered free radical, which then reacts both with heme and specific intraparasitic proteins (reviewed in Refs. 1Meshnick S.R. Taylor T.E. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 301-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Cumming J.N. Ploypradith P. Posner G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 37: 253-297Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The alkylation of intraparasitic proteins by artemisinin derivatives has been shown to occur at physiological drug concentrations to be selective for nonabundant proteins and to be dependent on the presence of the endoperoxide bridge. Several different artemisinin derivatives were found to alkylate the same proteins, yet they did not alkylate proteins in uninfected erythrocytes (3Asawamahasakda W. Ittarat I. Pu Y.-M. Ziffer H. Meshnick S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1854-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, alkylation of proteins is clearly associated with the antimalarial activity of artemisinin, although proof that this process mediates the antimalarial activity of the drug has not been obtained. To gain a better understanding of the mode of action of artemisinin, we have been isolating and identifying the most heavily labeled proteins. In this paper, we identify one of these target proteins as a translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) 1The abbreviations used are: TCTP, translationally controlled tumor protein; IA, iodoacetamide; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. homolog. Parasites P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were cultured by the method of Trager and Jensen (4Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6219) Google Scholar). Strain FCR3 was used for all experiments except pulse-field gels, for which strain 3D7 was employed. Parasites were synchronized with sorbitol lysis (5Lambros C. Vanderberg J.P. J. Parasitol. 1979; 65: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2855) Google Scholar). For autoradiograms, cultures were grown in the presence of 0.5 μCi/ml [10-3H]dihydroartemisinin (1.4 Ci/mmol; Moravek Biochemical, Brea, CA) for 3 h at 37 °C. Parasites were isolated and lysed as described (6Kamchonwongpaisan S. McKeever P. Hossler P. Leung M.Y. Ziffer H. Meshnick S.R. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1997; 56: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Extracts were stored at −80 °C. All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (7Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar) (Bio-Rad). Parasite extracts were mixed with sample buffer (0.57 gm/ml urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm CHAPS, 5% Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholytes (Bio-Rad), 5% mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 0.1 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at room temperature and vortexed. After the undissolved material was removed by a short spin in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 2 × 150-mm isoelectric focusing tube gel (8Young D.A. Voris B.P. Martin E.V. Colbert R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 190-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed at 400 V for 10 h followed by 1000 V for 2 h. The gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. Thirty-two regions of the isoelectric focusing gel were excised. For unlabeled extracts, corresponding regions from 10 different gels were pooled. Protein was then eluted in 5% Triton X-100, 3% SDS, and 5% mercaptoethanol to which solid Trizma (Tris base) was added until the pH was approximately 8. The suspensions were heated at 55 °C for 3 h and then transferred to a Centricon 3 and subjected to 100 V for 5 h in a Centrilutor Microelectroeluter (Millipore-Amicon, Bedford, MA). The eluate was then concentrated by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 2 h, dissolved in sample buffer (10% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol in 0.5 mTris buffer, pH 6.8), and subjected to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. For autoradiography, gels were treated with En3Hance (NEN Life Science Products), dried, and exposed to x-ray film for 30 days at −80 °C. A single band with a molecular mass of 25 kDa was found on the autoradiogram for the SDS gel lane run on the eluate from region 7 of the isoelectric focusing gel. This corresponded to the darkest band present in this lane as judged by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2). This band was then excised from a series of gels run on unlabeled parasite extracts and sent to the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility. The gel pieces were washed 4 times with 300 μl of 50% CH3CN, 200 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8.9. 500 μl of cyanogen bromide (10 mg/ml) in 70% formic acid was added and incubated overnight at room temperature. Gel pieces were extracted 4 times with 300 μl of CH3CN, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Supernatants were pooled, lyophilized, run on a 10–20% Tricine gel (Novex, San Diego CA), electroblotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore) using 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, 10% methanol and then Coomassie-stained. The bands were excised and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems 473A protein sequencer. An oligopeptide was synthesized containing the N-terminal 20 amino acids and linked to polylysine as a multiple antigenic peptide at the University of Michigan Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility. This was used to immunize two New Zealand White rabbits (Hazleton Research Products, Denver PA) with initial intradermal infections of 0.6 mg of antigen in Freund's complete adjuvant followed by subcutaneous booster injections of 300 μg in Freund's incomplete adjuvant administered every 3 weeks. Sera was obtained both before immunization and after the 4th and 5th booster injections. Immunoglobulin G was partially purified from sera by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by chromatography using DEAE Affi-Gel blue columns (9Harlow B. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 288-289Google Scholar). For Western blots, parasite homogenate was suspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) and gently sonicated for 10 s with a Branson sonifier. For each stage, 20 μg of protein was loaded into a well of a 10% NuPAGE gel (Novex). The gel was run at 200 V for 30 min followed by transfer to nitrocellulose via the Novex transfer system. Proteins were transferred at 25 V for 1 h. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C in 3% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 and washed with the same buffer. The membrane was divided into two sections with both containing lanes of rings, trophozoites, and molecular mass standards. One membrane was incubated with anti-TCTP and the other with prebleed serum at concentrations of 1:1,500 for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) for 60 min at room temperature. The membranes were then developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) technique according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to X-Omat XAR2 autoradiography film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Clone Pf0946M was obtained and sequenced from a library of mung bean nuclease-digested genomic DNA fragments as part of the malaria genome project (10Dame J.B. Arnot D.E. Bourke P.F. et al.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The portion of the clone encoding the TCTP homolog has been fully sequenced in both strands. The DNA sequence upstream of the initiator methionine codon was obtained by inverse polymerase chain reaction (11Triglia T. Peterson M. Kemp D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar) and sequenced. The molecular mass isoelectric point were predicted using ProtParam. 2http://expasy.hcuge.ch/sprot/protparam.html. Pulse-field gel blocks were made following the protocol of Kempet al. (12Kemp D.J. Corcoran L.M. Coppel R.L. Stahl H.D. Bianco A.E. Brown G.V. Anders R.F. Nature. 1985; 315: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and incubated in lysis buffer (0.5 mEDTA, 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, proteinase K (2 mg/ml)) for 48 h with one change of solution. Blocks were stored at 4 °C in 0.05 m EDTA. P. falciparum chromosomes were resolved on a 1% chromosomal grade agarose (Bio-Rad) gel run in 0.5× Tris-buffered EDTA at 7 °C using a CHEF-DRII (contour-clamped homogeneous electric field) apparatus (Bio-Rad) run at 80 V, 180–900 s (ramped) for 165 h. Gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. They were then blotted by alkaline transfer onto Hybond N+ (Amersham) nylon membrane following manufacturer's guidelines. The TCTP probe was radiolabeled by random priming (13Dame J.B. Reddy G.R. Yowell C.A. Dunn B.M. Kay J. Berry C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and hybridized under standard conditions at 65 °C. Blots were washed at high stringency (65 °C, 0.2× SSC (1× SSC, 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015m sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS) for 2 h with one change of solution before exposure to film. The TCTP coding sequence was cloned into the BamHI site of pET3a containing a 12-amino acid T7 fusion tag (Novagen, Madison WI). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS host cells transformed with the recombinant plasmid were induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C and grown with vigorous aeration for 3 h. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation, lysed by freeze-thawing, and resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) containing 80 units/ml DNase. Cellular debris and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 11,500 × g over a layer of 27% sucrose in the same buffer. The recombinant protein, which remained in the supernatant, was then diluted 10:1 with loading buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), applied onto a DEAE-cellulose column (0.75 × 7.5 cm), and eluted with a step gradient of this buffer containing 50 mm, then 100 mm, then 150 mm, and then 188 mm NaCl. Immediately before the experiment, hemin was dissolved in 0.1 n NaOH, neutralized with 0.1n HCl to pH 8, and then diluted with water to a final stock concentration of 1 mm. Unlabeled artemisinin was prepared as a 0.5 mm stock in ethanol. For each experiment, a series of 100-μl incubation mixtures were then prepared containing various combinations of purified recombinant TCTP (10 μg), hemin, [3H]dihydroartemisinin (5 nCi), and/or cold artemisinin and incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 24 h. In several experiments, recombinant plasmepsin I containing the same T7 fusion tag (13Dame J.B. Reddy G.R. Yowell C.A. Dunn B.M. Kay J. Berry C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 64: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was used instead of TCTP. In other experiments, Fe-EDTA was used instead of hemin. Immediately before this experiment, a 1 mm stock solution of ferrous-EDTA was made by mixing 2 mm solutions of disodium EDTA and FeSO4. All incubations were in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After 24 h, free drug was separated from bound drug by centrifugation through Centricon-3 microconcentrators (Amicon). The concentrators were washed twice with 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer. The radioactivity in the retentate, filtrate, and concentrator were added to Scintiverse BD scintillation fluid (Fisher) and counted in a Beckman LS7000 scintillation counter. Student's two-tailed t test and standard deviations were calculated using Microsoft Excel, version 4.0 for Macintosh. 10 μg of TCTP, bovine serum albumin, or bovine erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (Sigma) were dissolved in 100 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5) containing 5000 cpm of [3H]dihydroartemisinin with or without 1 μm hemin (prepared as in the previous section). The mixtures were incubated for 2, 8, or 24 h in the dark at 37 °C and then dialyzed for 24 h in Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (10,000 molecular weight cut-off; Pierce) in Tris-HCl buffer to remove free drug. The retentate was then measured as above. Recombinant P. falciparum TCTP (125 μg/ml, 5 μm) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5). Aliquots of hemin, prepared as above, were added to a quartz microcuvette containing 400 μl of the TCTP solution as well as to another cuvette containing 400 μl of buffer. UV-visible scans were performed on a Hewlett Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. The scans were saved and imported into Microsoft Excel (version 4.0 for Macintosh), where difference spectra were obtained by subtraction of the buffer plus hemin scan from the TCTP plus hemin scan. To better understand the nature of the binding, a mixture of 5 μm TCTP and 25 μm hemin was incubated in Tris-HCl (50 mm, pH 7.5) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark, after which the free hemin was removed by the addition of charcoal-coated dextran. The charcoal was separated by brief centrifugation, and the spectra of the supernatants were measured before and after the addition of a few milligrams of sodium dithionite. Regenerated cellulose membranes (12,000–14,000 dalton MWCO, Spectra/Pro 2, Spectrum Medical Industries, Los Angeles, CA) were first heated at 60 °C for 30 min in 2% NaHCO3, 1 mm EDTA, washed with distilled water, and stored at 4 °C in 0.1% sodium azide. Recombinant TCTP (250 μg/ml) and various concentrations of hemin (2 to 60 μm) were dissolved in 250 or 500 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, sealed inside dialysis tubing, and placed in 50-ml polypropylene tubes containing 10 ml of buffer and the identical concentration of hemin. The tubes were then wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light and incubated for 24 h at 4 °C on a platform rocker. The hemin concentrations in samples from both sides of the membrane were then determined by using a modification of the HemoQuant procedure (14Sullivan A.D. Ittarat I. Meshnick S.R. Parasitology. 1996; 112: 285-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Schwartz S. Dahl J Ellefson M. Ahlquist D. Clin. Chem. 1983; 29: 2061-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This quantitative method is based on the conversion of nonfluorescing heme to fluorescing protoporphyrin. The bound hemin concentration was determined by the subtraction of external (free) hemin concentration from the internal (bound + free) hemin concentration. A Scatchard plot (16Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar) was analyzed by linear regression analysis using Microsoft Excel. Recombinant TCTP (50 μg) was dissolved in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in the presence of 30 mmiodoacetamide (IA) or 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Free IA and β-mercaptoethanol were eliminated by centrifuging through a Centricon-3 (with two washes) or by dialysis against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at 4 °C with two changes of buffer. To measure the effects of these treatments on drug binding, aliquots (10 μg) of untreated, IA-treated, and β-mercaptoethanol-treated recombinant TCTP were incubated with hemin (1 μm) and [3H]dihydroartemisinin (10,000 cpm) at 37 °C for 24 h in a total volume of 100 μl. After incubation, free drug was separated from bound drug using the Centricon-3 as described previously. The radioactivity in the retentate and filtrate was assessed as above. To assess the effect of IA on the binding between recombinant TCTP and hemin, aliquots of IA-treated and untreated recombinant TCTP were sealed inside dialysis tubes (62.5 μg/250 μl of total volume) with 10 μm hemin both inside and outside the tubing. After 24 h at 4 °C on a platform rocker, the tubes were removed, and hemin was quantitated both inside and outside as above. Sequential isoelectric focusing and SDS gels were performed on both labeled and unlabeledP. falciparum homogenates. One band was found on the autoradiogram with a pI of ∼5 and molecular mass 25 kDa (Fig. 1). The corresponding band was excised and eluted from a series of isoelectric focusing gels run on untreated parasites. N-terminal and internal sequences were obtained. Both amino acid sequences match clone Pf0946M of the malaria genome project, whose DNA sequence was confirmed subsequently by sequencing in both directions and upstream of the start codon. Our determined amino acid sequences had 100% homology to amino acids 1–20 and 62–76 of the deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 3). The gene had a high degree of homology to members of the TCTP family (Fig. 3). The predicted pI and molecular mass, based on the amino acid sequence, are 4.58 and 20 kDa. Southern blots of pulse-field gels using a labeled TCTP probe demonstrated that a single copy of the gene was present on chromosome 4. The TCTP was expressed with a 12-amino acid fusion peptide on pET3a. The protein was purified to >95% purity as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 4 A). The recombinant protein has an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa and a pI of 4.9 (Fig. 4 B). Polyclonal antibodies prepared against the N-terminal 20-amino acid peptide react with a single band at 25 kDa (Fig. 5), which is presumably the TCTP. A much stronger band is present in trophozoites than in rings. The higher molecular mass bands seen on this immunoblot were also seen when prebleed antisera was used instead of anti-TCTP (not shown). When [3H]dihydroartemisinin and TCTP were incubated in vitro in the presence of hemin, 2.1 ± 0.46% of the total radioactivity used (n = 4) remained in the retentate with the protein. In contrast, when drug + TCTP alone or drug + hemin alone were incubated, less than one-third as much radioactivity was retained (0 ± 0.23, n = 3, and 0.67 ± 0.34,n = 3, respectively). This difference is statistically significant (p < 0.01), indicating that a hemin-dependent reaction between drug and TCTP occurred. The binding between drug and TCTP is specific, because much less radioactivity was retained in the presence of an excess of cold artemisinin (0.61 ± 0.33, n = 3,p < 0.01). No reaction between TCTP and drug was seen when 1 μm Fe-EDTA was added instead of hemin. A covalent bond formed between drug and protein in a time-dependent and specific manner. [3H]Dihydroartemisinin and hemin were incubated in the presence of TCTP, bovine serum albumin, superoxide dismutase, or no protein for 2, 8, and 24 h. Between 2.5 and 5 times as much radioactivity associated with TCTP than with the other proteins. After 24 h, retentates from the TCTP, albumin, superoxide dismutase, and no protein incubations contained 1.26, 0.48, 0.23, and 0.26% total radioactivity used, respectively. The drug reacted with the TCTP protein, not with hemin, since a radiolabeled protein band was observed by autoradiography (Fig. 4 C). The binding of dihydroartemisinin to TCTP was measured at various hemin concentrations (Fig. 6 A). In the presence of TCTP (10 μg), the amount of radioactivity retained was proportional to the concentration of hemin for the range of concentrations tested (R2 = 0.98). Radioactivity was also retained in the absence of TCTP, although the slope of this line was only one-third of that found in the presence of TCTP (R2 = 0.92). This is probably due to the formation of hemin-dihydroartemisinin adducts and hemin aggregates. To determine the number of dihydroartemisinin binding sites and whether the binding is saturable, dihydroartemisinin-TCTP binding was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of drug (Fig. 6 B). The quantity of drug retained increased until the drug reached a concentration of 200 μm, at which point the quantity appears to plateau. Because 10 μg of TCTP are present in each incubation (∼0.4 nmols), the magnitude of the plateau (0.4–0.5 nmols) suggests that a maximum of one drug molecule binds/molecule of protein. The affinity of recombinant TCTP for hemin was measured by equilibrium dialysis and analyzed using a Scatchard plot (Fig. 7). The plot was linear (R2 = 0.89). Based on the slope equaling −1/K d, the dissociation constant for hemin is 18 μm. The maximum amount of ligand binding (B max), based on the horizontal axis intercept, is 92 nmol/mg of protein. This is the equivalent of two hemin binding sites/protein molecule. To further characterize the hemin binding properties of the recombinant P. falciparumTCTP, the effects of TCTP on the UV-visible absorption spectra of hemin were characterized. The TCTP-hemin complex has a markedly different spectra than hemin alone (Fig. 8). The difference spectra has absorption maxima at 324 and 415 nm, which increase in magnitude with increasing hemin concentrations (Fig. 8). The 415-nm peak probably represents bound monomeric heme (17Beaven G.H. Chen S.H. D'Albis A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). TheP. falciparum TCTP contains a single cysteine at position 14 (Fig. 3). To assess the role of this amino acid in binding, recombinant TCTP was treated with either a thiol-blocking reagent, IA, or with β-mercaptoethanol, which will reduce oxidized dithiols. β-Mercaptoethanol had no effect on [3H]dihydroartemisinin binding, inhibiting binding by only 4% (Table I). The lack of effect of β-mercaptoethanol is consistent with the observation that recombinant TCTP migrates in SDS gels identically under both reducing and nonreducing conditions (not shown), suggesting that the recombinant TCTP thiol is ordinarily in the reduced state. In contrast, IA pretreatment inhibited [3H]dihydroartemisinin binding by 67% (p < 0.0003) (Table I), suggesting that this moiety is important in binding. It is possible that IA pretreatment might directly block drug binding or exert its effect indirectly by inhibiting hemin binding. However, there was no effect of IA pretreatment on hemin binding (Table I).Table IEffects of thiol modification on ligand binding to recombinant TCTPPretreatmentLigandPercent control ± S.D.

Interestingly, however, no peak was seen at 415 nm, suggesting that the binding in this case was occurring to μ-oxo-dimers (17Beaven G.H. Chen S.H. D'Albis A. Gratzer W.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 41: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). When the latter was reduced, no change in spectra was seen, suggesting that the heme-TCTP complex is not a redox-active enzyme. In this paper, we have purified, sequenced, cloned, and expressed the P. falciparum TCTP, which appears to be one of the principal malaria proteins that react with dihydroartemisinin when infected erythrocytes are incubated with radiolabeled drug (3Asawamahasakda W. Ittarat I. Pu Y.-M. Ziffer H. Meshnick S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1854-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Evidence that dihydroartemisinin reacts specifically with recombinant TCTP includes 1) the slow reactions of dihydroartemisinin with control proteins, 2) the binding of dihydroartemisinin to TCTP increases with increasing drug concentration, plateauing at approximately 1 drug bound/protein molecule, and 3) the inhibition of protein binding by a thiol-blocking reagent. Both the in vitro and in vivo reactions between dihydroartemisinin and TCTP may partly be the result of the presence of bound heme. The recombinant TCTP was found to have two hemin binding sites/molecule with modest affinity (K d = 18 μm). The 25-kDa artemisinin target protein is unlikely to be anything other than TCTP, based on comparisons of gels and autoradiograms. Antisera prepared against synthetic peptide reacts with one band in parasite extracts at M r 25 kDa (Fig. 5). This is the sameM r as the band seen on autoradiograms (Fig. 2) and as that determined for the recombinant TCTP (Fig. 4). 25 kDa is higher than the predicted M r for both native and recombinant TCTP (20 and 21 kDa, respectively), but the differences could be due to secondary structure. On isoelectric focusing gels, the antibody reacts with several bands, including one at pI 4.8 (not shown). The recombinant TCTP has a slightly higher pI (4.9, Fig. 4). This difference is probably due to contributions from the 12-amino acid tag, since the predicted pI for the recombinant TCTP is slightly higher than that predicted for native TCTP (4.63 versus 4.58). Autoradiograms of isoelectric focusing gels run on [3H]dihydroartemisinin-treated parasites show a band at pI 4.85 (not shown), which is consistent with the possibility that the reaction of an amino acid residue with dihydroartemisinin leads to a slight shift in pI. Two other observations confirm that TCTP is the 25-kDa protein that binds to dihydroartemisinin in vivo. First, because artemisinin may alter the pI of the target protein, it is theoretically possible that the autoradiogram band was aligned to a protein band with a pI different from that of the target protein. However, no other discrete 25-kDa protein band was seen at either higher or lower pIs (Fig. 2). Second, because bands were excised from more than 100 gels, pooled, and submitted for three separate sequencing runs, one would have expected some ambiguities if two proteins were co-migrating. In contrast, unambiguous and consistent sequence patterns were obtained (data not shown). Third, as predicted, artemisinin appears to react selectively with the recombinant protein in vitro. The specific amino acid residue that is modified by the drug is still unknown. The observed reaction between artemisinin and recombinant TCTP does not occur on the T7 fusion peptide tag, because no reaction was seen when [3H]dihydroartemisinin was incubated with hemin and recombinant plasmepsin I containing the same fusion tag (data not shown). On the other hand, the single cysteine appears to be necessary for the reaction between dihydroartemisinin and TCTP. It is possible that this cysteine is the actual amino acid modified by the drug. Alternately, it might serve as a source of electrons for the activation of the drug into a free radical. The results presented here offer new leads to understanding the mechanism of action of artemisinin and its derivatives. There is general agreement that free radical generation is involved in the mechanism of action of artemisinin, and that free radicals form as a result of an interaction with heme (reviewed in Refs. 1Meshnick S.R. Taylor T.E. Kamchonwongpaisan S. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 301-315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Cumming J.N. Ploypradith P. Posner G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1996; 37: 253-297Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). What isn't clear is how the resulting free radicals lead to parasite death. It has been suggested that artemisinin might kill parasites by the generation of activated oxygen, but there are many observations that are inconsistent with this mechanism (18Meshnick S.R. Lancet. 1994; 344: 1441-1442PubMed Google Scholar). A second possibility is that formation of artemisinin-hemin adducts might lead to parasite death (19Hong Y.-L. Yang Y.-Z. Meshnick S.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 63: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 20Robert A. Meunier B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 5968-5969Crossref Google Scholar). However, the preformed adduct is not toxic to parasites (21Meshnick S.R. Thomas A. Ranz A. Xu C.-M. Pan H.-Z. Mol. Biochem Parasitol. 1991; 49: 181-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and artemisinin treatment neither inhibits hemozoin formation nor causes its degradation (22Asawamahasakda W. Ittarat I. Chang C.-C. McElroy P. Meshnick S.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been suggested that artemisinin might kill parasites by inactivating specific malaria proteins (3Asawamahasakda W. Ittarat I. Pu Y.-M. Ziffer H. Meshnick S.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 1854-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Currently, there is no direct evidence demonstrating that alkylation of TCTP or any other malaria protein by the drug is the proximate cause of parasite killing. The observation reported here that trophozoite-stage parasites, which are most sensitive to artemisinin derivatives (23ter Kuile F. White N.J. Holloway P. Pasvol G. Krishna S. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), produce higher levels of TCTP than ring stages is consistent with its role as a drug target but does not prove it. Even if TCTP is alkylated as an “innocent bystander,” the fact that this reaction occurs bothin vitro and in vivo suggests that TCTP might somehow be associated with the true drug target. It is difficult to understand how TCTP alkylation could lead to parasite death, because relatively little is known about the physiological roles of TCTPs in general. TCTPs in other organisms appear to be cytosolic proteins that bind calcium and microtubules (24Haghighat N. Ruben L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 51: 99-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 25Gachet Y. Lee M. Sawitzki B. Tournier S. Poulton T. Bommer U.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sanchez J.C. Schaller D. Ravier F. Golaz O. Jaccoud S. Belet M. Wilkins M.R. James R. Deshusses J. Hochstrasser D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 150-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present the first evidence that they bind heme and react with an endoperoxide. Thus, the observations presented here suggest new approaches to understanding the functions of this class of proteins. Recombinant TCTP binds to hemin with modest affinity (18 μm). Thus, it has a binding affinity for hemin that is similar to that of human serum albumin (50 μm (17)). Concentrations of heme in the parasite food vacuole are extremely high; if TCTP were to enter the food vacuole, it is likely that both sites would become saturated. Thus, the observation of a modest heme binding could be physiologically relevant. Interestingly, 26 of the amino acids present in the P. falciparum TCTP (15.2%) are phenylalanines and tyrosines. 10 of these residues in the P. falciparum TCTP are conserved in at least 5 of the 6 other species (Fig. 3). Thus, some of the protein-heme binding may be based on pi-pi interactions between aromatic amino acids and the pyrrole rings of the heme. Although it is possible that TCTP is the artemisinin drug target, the observed reaction may also be unrelated to the killing effect of the drug. Nevertheless, the observed interactions between TCTP, hemin, and artemisinin might provide clues to the true target as well as insights into the physiological role of TCTP.

https://openalex.org/W2023395045,"Glial cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage express several highly related POU proteins including Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP and Brn-1. Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, but not Brn-1 efficiently cooperated with Sox10, the only SRY box protein so far identified in oligodendrocytes. Here we show that, in addition to Sox10, cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage contain significant amounts of the related SRY box proteins Sox4 and Sox11. During development, Sox11 was strongly expressed in the central nervous system. It was first detected in neural precursors throughout the neuroepithelium. During later stages of neural development, Sox11 was additionally expressed in areas of the brain in which neurons undergo differentiation. In agreement with its expression in neural precursors, Sox11 levels in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage were high in precursors and down-regulated during terminal differentiation. Outside the nervous system, expression of Sox11 was also detected in the developing limbs, face, and kidneys. Structure function analysis revealed that Sox11 has a strong intrinsic transactivation capacity which is mediated by a transactivation domain in its carboxyl-terminal part. In addition, Sox11 efficiently synergized with Brn-1. Synergy was dependent on binding of both proteins to adjacent DNA elements, and required the presence of the respective transactivation domain in each protein. Our data suggest the existence of a specific code in which POU proteins require specific Sox proteins to exhibit cooperative effects in glial cells.

Our data suggest the existence of a specific code in which POU proteins require specific Sox proteins to exhibit cooperative effects in glial cells. Many developmental regulators in vertebrates as well as invertebrates exert their function as transcription factors. With the advent of PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HMG, high mobility group; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase. 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HMG, high mobility group; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; CMV, cytomegalovirus; GST, glutathione S-transferase.-based cloning techniques, it has become increasingly evident that these transcription factors are organized in families of proteins with related DNA-binding domains. Two such families are the POU proteins and the Sox proteins which are both strongly involved in the development of the nervous system (1Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 2Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). POU proteins contact their target DNA in two adjacent major grooves, and contain as their DNA-binding domain a composite structure which consists of a divergent homeodomain and a juxtaposed POU-specific domain (3Klemm J.D. Rould M.A. Aurora R. Herr W. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1994; 77: 21-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This domain was originally identified in the mammalian proteins Pit-1, Oct-1, and Oct-2 as well as in theCaenorhabditis elegans developmental regulator unc-86 (4Herr W. Sturm R.A. Clerc R.G. Corcoran L.M. Baltimore D. Sharp P.A. Ingraham H.A. Rosenfeld M.G. Finney M. Ruvkun G. Horvitz H.R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1513-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In the meantime, 40 different POU proteins have been identified in species ranging from nematodes to mammals (2Ryan A.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1207-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). These proteins can be grouped in at least 6 subclasses, with members of classes III and IV being predominantly expressed in the developing and adult nervous system (5Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Sox proteins on the other hand bind to DNA mainly through minor groove contacts with a domain that was originally identified in the high-mobility group proteins HMG-1 and HMG-2 (6Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar). Contrary to the HMG box of these two chromatin proteins, the subtype of HMG domain present in all Sox proteins, the so called Sry-box (= Sox), mediates sequence-specific DNA binding (7Laudet V. Stehelin D. Clevers H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2493-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) as evidenced by the analysis of the prototypic HMG domain from the sex determining factor, SRY (8Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Similar to POU proteins, more than 20 different members of the family of Sox proteins have been characterized which can be divided into 6 different groups (1Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Expression of most Sox proteins is widespread and often includes parts of the developing or adult nervous system. Thus, most cells would be expected to express at least one member of the Sox protein family and one member of the POU family. Members of both families have been shown to be capable of functional interaction in at least two cases. In embryonic stem cells, Oct-3/4 and Sox2 were shown to be involved in the activation of the FGF-4 gene and to functionally interact on the enhancer of this gene (9Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 10Yuan H.B. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). A comparable synergistic activation of gene expression was also observed for the class III POU protein Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP and the Sox10 protein which are co-expressed in various groups of glial cells (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas glial cells of the Schwann cell lineage express Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP as their sole class III POU protein (12Monuki E.S. Weinmaster G. Kuhn R. Lemke G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 783-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 13Monuki E.S. Kuhn R. Weinmaster G. Trapp B. Lemke G. Science. 1990; 249: 1300-1303Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), other glial cells, for instance those of the oligodendrocyte lineage, express additional class III POU proteins (14Collarini E.J. Kuhn R. Marshall C.J. Monuki E.S. Lemke G. Richardson W.D. Development. 1992; 116: 193-200PubMed Google Scholar) such as Brn-1 and Brn-2 (15Schreiber J. Enderich J. Sock E. Schmidt C. Richter-Landsberg C. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32286-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Our previous analysis had shown that contrary to Tst-1/Oct6/SCIP, Brn-1 could not functionally interact with Sox10 (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This observation prompted us to search for other Sox proteins in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage and analyze them for their ability to function synergistically with Brn-1. Here we identify the class C proteins Sox4 and Sox11 in cells of the oligodendrocyte lineage, analyze the expression of Sox11 during mouse development, and for the first time characterize its functional properties. The ability of both Sox11 and Sox4 to cooperatively function with Brn-1 leads us to postulate that there exists a specific code in which Sox proteins and POU proteins combine to exhibit synergistic properties. Oligodendroglial cultures were prepared from the brains of 1-day-old Wistar rats as described (16McCarthy K.D. DeVellis J. J. Cell. Biol. 1980; 85: 890-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (3366) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (17Sock E. Leger H. Kuhlbrodt K. Schreiber J. Enderich J. Richter-Landsberg C. Wegner M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 1911-1919Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Schwann cells were isolated from 3-day-old rats by the method of Brockeset al. (18Brockes J.P. Fields P. Raff M.C. Brain Res. 1979; 165: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), as modified by Porteret al. (19Porter S. Clark M.B. Glaser L. Bunge R.P. J. Neurosci. 1986; 6: 3070-3078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rat CG-4 cells were grown on poly-l-ornithine-coated plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing N1 supplement (5 μg/ml transferrin, 16 μg/ml putrescine, 60 ng/ml progesterone, 50 ng/ml selenium, 5 μg/ml insulin), 10 ng/ml platelet-derived growth factor, and 5 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (20Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Differentiation of CG-4 cells was induced by omitting platelet-derived growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor from the medium. U138 human glioblastoma cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. RNA was isolated from cell cultures using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Poly(A)+ RNA was prepared using Oligotex-dT (Quiagen). For the identification of Sox genes in oligodendroglial cells, 2 μg of total RNA from CG-4 cells were reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) primer (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 μl of this reaction were amplified using the degenerate primers 5′-AAGGCCGGATCCATGAA(CT)GC(ACT)TT(CT)AT(AGT)GT(TGCA)TGG-3′ and 5′-AAGGCCGGATCC(TGCA)GGTCTT(AG)TA(CT)TT(AG)TA(AG)TC(TGCA)G-3′ as described (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amplification products were subcloned into theBamHI site of pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) and sequenced. For the analysis of Sox11 expression in glial cells, 2 μl of cDNA from Schwann cells, CG-4 cells, and primary oligodendrocytes were amplified with primer pairs specific for rat Sox11 (5′-CGTTGGAAGATGCTGAAGGACA-3′ and 5′-CCGCTGGATGAGGAGGTGGACA-3′, yielding a 650-base pair product), Brn-1 (5′-CAACAGCCACGACCCTCACT-3′ and 5′-CAGAACCAGACCCGCACGAC-3′, yielding a 450-base pair product), and GAPDH (5′-GCCATCAA(C/T)GACCCCTTCATT-3′and 5′-CGCCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTT-3′, yielding a 700-base pair product). In addition to 40 pmol of each primer in a selected pair, polymerase chain reactions contained 0.2 mm dNTP, 2 nm [α-32P]dCTP, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase in 40 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v), 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm MgCl2. After denaturation (1 min at 94 °C), 12, 15, 18, or 21 cycles were performed with each cycle consisting of a denaturation (30 s at 94 °C), an annealing (30 s at 50 °C), and an elongation step (45 s at 72 °C). Amplification products were analyzed by autoradiography after electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels. The 200-bp fragments corresponding to the HMG domain of Sox4 and Sox11 were radiolabeled and used to screen an oligo(dT)-primed cDNA library constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of undifferentiated CG-4 cells in λ-Ziplox (Life Technologies, Inc.). Plasmids were excised from several independent positive λ phages according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmids with the longest inserts were chosen for further analysis. Both pZL1/Sox4 and pZL1/Sox11 had 2-kilobase pair inserts, and contained the full open reading frame of either Sox protein. The sequence of rat Sox11 was determined over the open reading frame and deposited in EMBL/GenBank under accession number AJ004858. The Sox4 and Sox11 cDNA were inserted into the EcoRI site of pCMV5, yielding the mammalian expression plasmids pCMV/Sox4 and pCMV/Sox11. By adding a eukaryotic translation initiation consensus immediately in front of the HMG domain of Sox11 and by introducing a stop codon immediately behind the HMG domain of Sox11, deletion mutants Sox11ΔN and Sox11ΔC were generated in the context of pCMV5. The HMG domain of Sox11 was also inserted into pGEX-KG after PCR-directed introduction of flanking BamHI and XhoI sites. Bacterial expression of Sox11 holoprotein required the cloning of Sox11 coding sequences between EcoRI and XhoI sites of pET28 (Novagen). Eukaryotic expression plasmids pCMV/Tst-1, pCMV/Brn-2, and pCMV/Brn-3 have been described (21Gerrero M.R. McEvilly R.J. Turner E. Lin C.R. O'Connell S. Jenne K.J. Hobbs M.V. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc.

A. 1993; 90: 4743-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). pCMV/Brn-1 contained the open reading frame of rat Brn-1 as part of a 2.2-kilobase pair EcoRI,NsiI fragment. Expression plasmids for mutant Brn-1 proteins were created by deleting the region between amino acids 3 and 310 to obtain pCMV/Brn-1ΔN, by introducing a stop codon after amino acid 462 to obtain pCMV/Brn-1 ΔC, or by changing amino acids 450 and 451 from tryptophan and phenylalanine to cysteine and serine to obtain pCMV/Brn-1 mt. pCMVGal4 contained coding sequences for the DNA-binding domain of the yeast Gal4 protein (24Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Insertion of Sox11 sequences led to an in-frame fusion of both open reading frames, with Sox11 following Gal4 sequences (pCMVGal4/Sox11). Fragments corresponding to amino acids 1–43, 125–395, 125–279, and 273–395 of Sox11 were generated by PCR with flanking EcoRI and KpnI sites and inserted into pCMVGal4, yielding pCMVGal4/Sox11 N, pCMVGal4/Sox11 C1, pCMVGal4/Sox11 C2, and pCMVGal4/Sox11 C3, respectively. The luciferase reporter plasmids 3xUAS luc, 3xSX luc, and 3xFXO luc have been described (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schreiber J. Sock E. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4739-4744Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). RNA blot analysis with 4 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and in situ hybridization on embryos from natural matings between inbred CD-1 mice were performed as described (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 1.5-kilobase pair BglII/SalI fragment from pZL/Sox11, that lacked most of the sequences coding for the HMG domain of Sox11, served as a probe for Northern blot analysis after random 32P labeling. For in situhybridization, a 1-kilobase pair segment of the Sox11 cDNA lacking HMG domain sequences was transcribed into an antisense riboprobe by SP6 RNA polymerase after linearizing pZL1/Sox11 with StyI. For the sense probe, pZL1/Sox11 was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase afterBamHI linearization. Transcription reactions were performed using the Ambion transcription kit for the production of35S-UTP-labeled probes, and the Boehringer digoxigenin labeling kit for the production of digoxigenin-labeled probes. U138 cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique as described (25Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). COS cells were transfected by the DEAE dextran technique using a concentration of 500 μg/ml DEAE dextran followed by chloroquine treatment (26Sock E. Renner K. Feist D. Leger H. Wegner M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For luciferase assays, cells were transfected with 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.05–2 μg of CMV expression plasmid per 60-mm plate. The total amount of plasmid was kept constant using empty CMV vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and extracts were assayed for luciferase activity (23Wegner M. Drolet D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4743-4747Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Full-length Sox11 protein was produced inEscherichia coli BL21 DE3 as a hexahistidine fusion protein using the pET expression system (Novagen). Purified denatured Sox11 holoprotein was used as antigen to raise an antiserum in rabbit. Expression of a fusion protein between GST and the HMG domain of Sox11 from pGEX/Sox11 in E. coli DH5α and purification procedures were as described (25Renner K. Leger H. Wegner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6433-6437Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Nuclear and whole cell extracts were prepared and used for Western blots and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Sock E. Renner K. Feist D. Leger H. Wegner M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FXO oligonucleotide and its mutant versions FX-, F-O, and F– (sequences as shown in Fig. 6) were used as probes in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. 1:3000 dilutions of rabbit antisera against Sox11 or Brn-1 (15Schreiber J. Enderich J. Sock E. Schmidt C. Richter-Landsberg C. Wegner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32286-32293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or a mouse monoclonal against the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 (CLONTECH) served as primary antibodies in Western blots. To identify Sox proteins present in oligodendroglial cells, we used the same PCR strategy which we had previously employed to identify Sox proteins in Schwann cells (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The degenerate primers recognized all known Sox genes equally well as evident from sequence comparison of primers and published Sox genes. The CG-4 cell line (20Louis J.C. Magal E. Muir D. Manthorpe M. Varon S. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) served as a source for oligodendroglial cDNA. As already observed in Schwann cells, Sox10 was the most frequently detected Sox protein representing 44% of all clones. However, contrary to Schwann cells two other Sox proteins were detected in significant amounts in cDNA from CG-4 cells. Among the 25 sequenced PCR products 11 were identical to Sox4 or the related Sox11. These two Sox proteins thus also account for a combined share of 44%. No other Sox protein was detected in more than a single PCR product. We used the PCR products corresponding to the HMG domain of Sox4 and Sox11 to screen a rat CG-4 cDNA library. The largest of the positive isolates for Sox4 and Sox11 contained the respective complete open reading frame. Whereas Sox4 has been studied extensively in the past primarily with regard to its function in lymphocytes and in the developing embryonic heart (27Schilham M.W. Oosterwegel M.A. Moerer P. Ya J. Deboer P.A.J. Vandewetering M. Verbeek S. Lamers W.H. Kruisbeek A.M. Cumano A. Clevers H. Nature. 1996; 380: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 28van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), comparatively little was known about Sox11 at the time. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid sequence of rat Sox11. Comparison of the 395-amino acid open reading frame with its mouse, human, chick, and Xenopusorthologues (29Hargrave M. Wright E. Kun J. Emery J. Cooper L. Koopman P. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 30Jay P. Goze C. Marsollier C. Taviaux S. Hardelin J.-P. Koopman P. Berta P.

Dev. 1995; 49: 23-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) revealed significant identity on the amino acid level. Homology was highest between rat and mouse with only nine amino acid differences and an overall identity of 98%. Interestingly, the rat, mouse, and chicken proteins were significantly shorter than the human protein due to the insertion of amino acid sequences in the human sequence. These insertions were primarily found in the central portion of the protein, and were largely absent from both the amino-terminal part of the protein, including the HMG domain and the carboxyl-terminal part. A similar observation was made for human and mouse Sox4 (28van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. van Norren K. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3847-3854Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). To assess Sox11 expression in rodents, we performed in situhybridization histochemistry on whole mounts and frozen sections of mouse embryos. At embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5), weak hybridization signals were detected over the whole embryo (data not shown). By E8.5, signal intensity had increased. Sox11-specific hybridization signals were still detected over the whole embryo with the exception of the heart primordium, and were most prominent in the neuroepithelium of the rostral neural plate and over the somites (Fig. 2 A). At E9.5, Sox11 was also expressed in the caudal parts of the neural tube with uniform distribution of Sox11 transcripts throughout the neuroepithelium (data not shown). Strong hybridization signals were additionally detected in the optic and the otic vesicles as well as the first and the second branchial arches (Fig. 2 B). By E10.5, the central nervous system had become the main site of Sox11 expression. All compartments of the brain and spinal cord were marked (Fig. 2 C). Up to E13.5, the intensity of the hybridization signal increased without a significant change in the pattern of Sox11 expression (Fig. 2,C-E). At E14.5, a rostral to caudal gradient in labeling intensity became apparent. The forebrain area and several nuclei in the brainstem, as for example, the inferior olive, the superior olive, and the pontine nuclei, still exhibited strong hybridization signals, whereas labeling intensity in other parts of the central nervous system, e.g. the spinal cord, was decreasing (Fig. 2 F). At E16.5, the developing hippocampal formation and the inferior colliculus of the mesencephalon were additionally marked by increased labeling intensity. The external granular cell layer of the cerebellum and the deep cerebellar nuclei exhibited stronger expression than the surrounding nervous tissue. Some areas of the diencephalon, as for example, the median geniculate nucleus, the nuclei of the hypothalamus, and the retina, were also marked by hybridization signals (Fig. 2 G). The cortex was no longer uniformly labeled. Strong signals were seen over the ventricular and subventricular zones and the cortical plate, whereas the intermediate zone exhibited only weak hybridization. At E18.5, signal intensities in the telencephalon and in the inferior colliculus of the mesencephalon had further increased. With the exception of the nuclei of the auditory pathway and the external granular cell layer of the cerebellum, hybridization signals were barely above background in other parts of the brain (Fig. 2 H). Sox11 was also expressed in the ganglia of the developing peripheral nervous system, albeit at relatively low levels when compared with the central nervous system. Transcripts were detected in the dorsal root ganglia (Fig. 2 C), in the craniofacial ganglia (Fig. 2 D), and in the sympathetic ganglia (data not shown). Outside the nervous system, a variety of organs expressed Sox11 transiently at moderate levels, as exemplified for the kidney. Hybridization signals in the metanephric kidney were detected at E13.5 and were confined to the glomeruli of the cortex. At E18.5, signal intensity had declined to levels slightly above background. Additional hybridization signals were detected in the limbs and the facial area. The limbs strongly expressed Sox11 from the earliest limb bud stages. At later stages, Sox11 was preferentially detected at the distal extremity surrounding the cartilage condensation of the digits (Fig. 2, C-E). By E16.5, Sox11 transcripts had disappeared from the limbs. In the facial area, Sox11 was expressed in large parts of the facial mesenchyme at E10.5 and E11.5 (Fig. 2, C and D). At later stages, only the nasal epithelium was strongly labeled (Fig. 2, G and H). Weaker signals were detected surrounding the optic vesicle and in the developing teeth. The whole tooth anlage exhibited hybridization with slightly higher signal intensity in the odontoblast layer (data not shown). The general decrease in Sox11 expression during late embryogenesis continued during postnatal development, and might explain our failure to detect significant levels of Sox11 message in tissues of adult mouse and rat by Northern blot analysis. Analyzed tissues included brain, heart, skeletal muscle, testis, liver, the adrenal gland, spleen, lung, and kidney (data not shown). To define Sox11 expression in the oligodendroglial lineage, we made use of the CG-4 cell line which has been shown to function as a reliable model system for the differentiation of oligodendrocytes from their O2-A precursors (15Schreiber J.

Res. 1992; 31: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from CG-4 cells before the onset of differentiation as well as 2 days after induction and analyzed for the presence of Sox11 transcripts in Northern blot analysis (Fig. 3 A). Transcript levels were high in undifferentiated CG-4 cells but strongly decreased during the early phase of differentiation concomitant with a reciprocal increase in myelin basic protein message, a marker for the terminal differentiation of all myelinating glia. Similar results were also obtained in semi-quantitative PCR on cDNA from CG-4 cells. Samples were removed from each PCR after 12, 15, 18, and 21 cycles at which time amplification was still in the linear range. Amounts of cDNA present in each sample were normalized to the GAPDH-specific product obtained from each cDNA (Fig. 3 B). Undifferentiated CG-4 cells, which correspond to oligodendrocyte progenitors, expressed significant amounts of Sox11 as well as of the POU protein Brn-1. In agreement with Northern blot analysis, Sox11 expression was strongly down-regulated after differentiation of CG-4 cells as judged from the amounts of PCR products in samples from differentiated and undifferentiated CG-4 cells. The decrease of Sox11 expression was paralleled by a comparable decrease in Brn-1 expression. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis was also performed on cDNA samples derived from primary oligodendroglial cells and Schwann cells (Fig. 3 B). Confirming our results from CG-4 cells, Sox11 and Brn-1 were expressed in the oligodendrocyte lineage. In contrast, cDNA from Schwann cells did not contain significant amounts of Sox11 nor Brn-1. Using reporter plasmid 3xSX luc, in which expression of luciferase is driven by a promoter consisting of a TATA box and multimerized Sox binding motifs, we next analyzed the transcriptional capacity of Sox11 by co-transfection into U138 glioblastoma cells (Fig. 4). Sox11 proved to be a strong transcriptional activator of this luciferase reporter. We consistently observed a 30–40-fold stimulation of this reporter by Sox11, whereas Sox4 led on average to a 10-fold stimulation. Notably, Sox10 failed to activate the same reporter under identical conditions (11Kuhlbrodt K. Herbarth B. Sock E. Hermans-Borgmeyer I. Wegner M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 237-250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To map the region of Sox11 which is responsible for the observed transcriptional activity, we fused various parts of Sox11 to the DNA-binding dom"

The success of these semi-synthesis studies sets the stage for the future generation of semi-synthetic ς70 molecules in which unnatural amino acids and biophysical probes are site-specifically incorporated in the RNA polymerase complex. It is becoming increasingly clear that regulation of transcription involves protein-protein contacts between RNA polymerase and transcription factors (1Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Characterization of these interactions, at the molecular level, is a prerequisite to fully understanding transcription mechanism and regulation. The ability to site-specifically incorporate unnatural amino acids (containing biophysical or biochemical probes) into the protein components of the transcription apparatus would greatly aid the study of these complex macromolecular machines. Recent years have seen the development of a number of methods designed to allow the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into proteins (2Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Structure. 1995; 3: 649-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although powerful, each of these techniques has associated with it certain practical or synthetic limitations which have to some extent restricted their widespread application. Total chemical synthesis, which provides unparalleled freedom to manipulate protein structure, has been dominated in recent years by the use of chemical ligation techniques (7Kemp D.S. Carey R.I. J. Org. Chem. 1993; 58: 2216-2222Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Liu C.-F. Tam J.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4149-4153Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 9Schnölzer M. Kent S.B.H.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1995; 36: 229-230Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Among these, the “native chemical ligation” approach by Kent et al. (14Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar) has proven a particularly useful route to synthetic proteins. In this process, an N-terminal cysteine-containing peptide is chemically ligated to a peptide possessing a C-terminal thioester group with the resultant formation of a normal peptide bond at the ligation site. Despite the generality of the ligation chemistry, the strategy has been constrained by the need to generate the peptide building blocks using stepwise solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS). 1The abbreviations used are: SPPS, solid phase peptide synthesis; His6-tag, hexahistidine-tag; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Fmoc,N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. The size limitations imposed by this requirement have restricted the application of native chemical ligation to the study of small proteins and protein domains (6Muir T.W. Structure. 1995; 3: 649-652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Protein semi-synthesis, in which synthetic peptides and protein cleavage fragments are linked together, offers an attractive route to the generation of large protein analogs containing unnatural amino acids (15Wallace C.J.A. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1995; 6: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The utility of existing semi-synthesis strategies is, however, tempered by the need to have unique chemical or enzymatic cleavage sites at the appropriate position within the protein of interest. The recently introduced expressed protein ligation technique directly addresses these limitations by providing a general way of chemically attaching synthetic peptides (via a putative native chemical ligation step) to the C terminus of recombinant proteins without the need to perform any intervening fragmentation steps (2Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Here we report the results of model studies designed to explore further the chemical mechanism of expressed protein ligation. Insights gained from this preliminary work were then successfully applied to the generation of a functional semi-synthetic version of the 613 residue ς70subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase. The plasmid pCYB2_ς500–566, which expresses a 66-amino acid fragment of ς fused to intein-CBD from an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducibletrc promoter, was constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the corresponding fragment of rpoD and recloning it in NdeI-SmaI-treated plasmid pCYB2 (New England Biolabs). A linker of two non-natural amino acids (Ala-Gly) was inserted between the last amino acid of ς (Ile566) and Cys1 of the intein. pCYB2_ς1–566 was constructed similarly. The naturalNdeI site at codon 452 of rpoD was removed by site-directed mutagenesis to facilitate the cloning. The protein sequence remained the same due to degeneracy of the genetic code. The plasmids were transformed into the E. coli XL1-blue; cells were grown to mid-log phase in 2 liters of LB medium plus 200 μg of ampicillin/ml and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside overnight. The expression level was low (∼1 mg/liter), and we could barely detect the band of the overexpressed proteins on SDS gels. After recovery by centrifugation, cells were resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mmEDTA, pH 7.9, and lysed by passage through a French press, and the lysate was cleared by low speed centrifugation. The overexpressed proteins were recovered from the cytosolic fraction by affinity chromatography on a 2-ml chitin column equilibrated in the same buffer as suggested by the manufacturer. The column was washed with 50 ml of buffer, and 25 ml of 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 0.2m NaCl and drained, and the beads were stored as a 50% suspension in the same buffer at 4 °C until further use. AsiA was purified as described by Severinova et al. (16Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyö D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Plasmid expressing AsiA genetically fused to a C-terminal promoter was provided by D. Hinton. The protein was overexpressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified to homogeneity by IMAC. AsiA proteins were concentrated using a Centricon 3 centrifugal filter (Amicon) and stored at −20 °C in a buffer containing 50% glycerol. All peptides were chemically synthesized according to optimized t-butyloxycarbonyl SPPS (17Schnölzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) and purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC using a Vydac C-18 column. In all cases, peptide composition and purity were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry and analytical HPLC. Fluorescein was attached to the ε-amino group of the lysine residue in the peptide NH2-CEDNEYTARE-aminocaproate-K-CO2H prior to the the final cleavage/deprotection step using at-butyloxycarbonyl-Lys-ε-(NH-Fmoc) orthogonal protection strategy. The construct His6-Cys-[SCH2]-aminocaproate-ς568–600was prepared by chemically ligating the purified, unprotected peptides NH2-His6-Cys-CO2H and bromo-acetyl (BrAc)aminocaproate-ς568–600 using the previously described thioether-based chemical ligation strategy (11Muir T.W. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. Kent S.B.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7701-7708Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). 100–500 μl of 50% chitin bead suspension was combined with various cofactors in the presence or in the absence of 1 mm synthetic peptide. Cofactors were used at 100 mm concentration (dithiothreitol, mercaptoacetic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and cysteine) and 1.5% v/v (thiophenol). Reactions were performed in 0.2 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 200 mm NaCl (dithiothreitol, thiophenol, and cysteine), or 0.5 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3 (N-acetylcysteine and mercaptoacetic acid). All reactions were incubated overnight with gentle agitation and then diluted 10-fold with transcription buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Model experiments involving ς500–566 were carried out at room temperature. Experiments involving ς1–566 were carried out in the cold room, and all buffers were supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to minimize proteolytic degradation. The beads were allowed to settle, and the supernatant was dialyzed against two 1-liter changes of transcription buffer. The protein was then concentrated on a C-30 concentrator (Amicon) to ∼1 mg/ml, diluted 2-fold with glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. 100-μl reactions contained 15 μl of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Quigen), 50–100 pmol of ς70 or ς70 derivative, 200 pmol of AsiAHis, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature, after which the beads were pelleted by brief centrifugation, and the supernatant containing the unbound material was removed. The beads were then washed three times with the same buffer containing 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, resuspended in 50 μl of the buffer containing 100 mmimidazole, and incubated for an additional 15 min at room temperature. The supernatant containing the bound material was then withdrawn. Aliquots of the reactions were then analyzed on 8–25% Phast gels (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and silver-stained. For transcription reactions, washed Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads containing ς70 or the ligation product immobilized through AsiAHis were treated with an equal volume of 7m guanidine HCl (15 min at room temperature with agitation). 10 μl of the supernatants was removed, diluted to 100 μl with transcription buffer, and used for transcription reactions. Abortive initiation reactions were performed in 20 μl of transcription buffer containing 20 nm of either the 123-base pair T7 A2 promoter containing DNA fragment (18Severinov K. Darst S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13481-13486Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or the 150-base pair gal P1 fragment (19Minchin S. Busby S. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 771-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), 40 nm RNAP core enzyme (β′, β, α235-dimer), 0.5 mm CpG (T7 A2) or ApU (gal P1), and 50 μm α-[32P]CTP (30 Ci/mmol), 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 40 mmKCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were supplemented with 5 μl (∼10 pmol) of ς70 or ligation product prepared as described above. The amount of cleavage product added to the reaction was equal to that of ς70 or ligation product based on visual inspection of stained SDS gels. Reactions proceeded for 15 min at 37 °C and were terminated by addition of an equal volume of loading buffer containing 6m urea. Transcription products were analyzed by urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide), followed by autoradiography. The long term objective of our studies is to explore transcription mechanism through the generation of semi-synthetic versions of the various subunits of E. coliRNA polymerase. In the current work, we are interested in systematically chemically modifying the C-terminal region of the ς70 subunit. Our approach is based around the chemical ligation of a synthetic peptide (corresponding to the C-terminal region of ς70) to a recombinant protein constituting the remainder of the ς70 sequence. Our previous studies have shown that the commercially available pCYB expression plasmids (New England Biolabs) offer a way of generating recombinant proteins that are able to participate in ligation reactions with synthetic peptides possessing cysteine residues at their N terminus (2Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Since pCYB expression vectors make use of a genetically manipulated protein splicing system (20Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirnonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-28120Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar), a process which has been shown to involve the intermediacy of a thioester (21Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), it is presumed that the reaction of the synthetic peptide with the recombinant protein goes via native chemical ligation (14Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar). Before attempting the generation of a full size semi-synthetic ς70 subunit, a series of model studies were carried out using a smaller recombinant fragment of the protein more amenable to accurate mass spectrometric analysis. The purpose of these studies were 2-fold: (i) to study the chemical mechanism of expressed protein ligation, and (ii) to explore the feasibility of applying the semi-synthesis approach to the ς70 system. As a model system, a short recombinant fragment corresponding to amino acids 500–566 of the 613-amino acid long E. coli RNA polymerase ς70 subunit was cloned into the pCYB vector. Subsequent overexpression in E. coli resulted in the generation of a protein chimera in which the desired ς70 fragment was C-terminally fused to an intein protein splicing element itself linked to a chitin binding domain (CBD), included to allow rapid purification by affinity chromatography on chitin beads (20Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirnonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.-Q. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 192: 271-28120Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Our initial investigations focused on the release of the desired ς70 fragment from the immobilized chimera through the treatment with various thiol-containing molecules. As can be seen from Table I, N-acetylcysteine was the only agent tried that failed to support detectable cleavage of the polypeptide from the support. In contrast, dithiothreitol, cysteine, mercaptoacetic acid, and thiophenol all caused efficient cleavage of the chimeric protein. Analysis of cleavage supernatants by reverse-phase HPLC revealed, in all cases, the presence of two main peaks. Electrospray mass spectrometry indicated that the first HPLC peak (∼75% of the total product) corresponded to ς amino acids 501–566 plus the two C-terminal linker amino acids Ala-Gly (see “Experimental Procedures”) and thus had the first methionine residue removed. The second, minor peak contained the unprocessed product with the first methionine in place. The molecular weights of the major processed products of the different cleavage reactions are shown in Table I. The products of the cysteine, mercaptoacetic acid, and thiophenol cleavages had masses consistent with C-terminally derivatized polypeptides, whereas the major product of the dithiothreitol-mediated cleavage had a free C-terminal carboxyl group.Table IIdentification of the expressed protein cleavage and ligation productsCofactorObserved massCalculated massaAverage isotope composition.

Open table in a new tab Of particular relevance to the mechanism of expressed protein ligation is the exact chemical nature of the C-terminal group present on the cleavage product following treatment with a thiol agent. To investigate this, the major product from the thiophenol cleavage reaction was isolated and subsequently exposed to elevated pH. This resulted in its clean conversion into an earlier eluting form (by HPLC) with a mass exactly 92 Da less than before. Such a mass change is indicative of the hydrolysis of the phenyl α-thioester derivative of the sigma polypeptide back to the free acid. Note, the product of the cysteine cleavage reaction was stable to high pH, evidence that the initial thioester product had, as expected, rearranged to a stable amide. Next we evaluated whether the immobilized ς70fragment could be chemically ligated to a short synthetic peptide (NH2-Cys-Glu-Asp-Asn-Glu-Tyr-Thr-Ala-Arg-Glu-aminocapro-ate-Lys-ε-[fluorescein]-CO2H) containing an N-terminal cysteine to facilitate ligation and a C-terminal fluorescein reporter group. Initial studies in which the beads were simply treated with a solution containing 1 mmpeptide at pH 7.3 were unsuccessful, and neither ligation nor protein cleavage was detected, even after prolonged incubations. The presence of thiol cofactors can appreciably accelerate native chemical ligation reactions both in solution (22Dawson P.E. Churchill M.J. Ghadiri M.R. Kent S.B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 4325-4329Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and on solid phase (23Camarero J.A. Cotton G.C. Adeva A. Muir T.W. J. Pept. Sci. 1998; 51: 303-316Google Scholar). Consequently, we investigated the effect of thiol co-factors on our model ligation reaction (Table I). Consistent with our previous findings (2Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar), thiophenol was the only cofactor that supported efficient ligation of the synthetic peptide to the recombinant ς70 fragment. Inclusion of 1.5% v/v of thiophenol in the ligation mixture at pH 7.3 containing the synthetic peptide (1 mm) resulted in extremely efficient ligation (>90% after overnight incubation) as indicated by HPLC and electrospray mass spectrometry analysis. The ligation product had a mass of 9023 Da and thus corresponded to the desired semi-synthetic polypeptide (expected mass = 9024 Da since the masses of ς fragment and synthetic peptide were 7215 and 1827 Da, respectively). The stability of the ligation product to the high concentration of thiophenol present in the ligation buffer confirms the presence of an amide linkage (and not a labile-thioester bond) at the ligation junction (14Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar, 22Dawson P.E. Churchill M.J. Ghadiri M.R. Kent S.B.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 4325-4329Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Note that no ligation was detected using a control peptide that did not contain an N-terminal cysteine residue. The absolute requirement of thiophenol as a cofactor taken together with the results of our initial cleavage studies, indicates that the phenyl α-thioester derivative of the ς polypeptide is being generated in situ during the reaction and is then reacting with the synthetic peptide via a native chemical ligation reaction. Interestingly, both thiophenol-mediated cleavage and ligation reactions were found to follow similar kinetics (each taking several hours to go to completion) and are appreciably slower than is typically observed when using synthetic fragments (22Dawson P.E.

The slow kinetics of the thiophenol-mediated cleavage/ligation probably reflects the position of the equilibrium in the initial A → S acyl transfer within the chimera. Based on the data from these model studies we propose the ligation mechanism shown in Fig. 1 in which the highly reactive phenyl α-thioester derivative of the recombinant polypeptide is produced in situ during the ligation process. Once generated this derivative will quickly and irreversibly react with the synthetic peptide to give the final product, thus generating a reaction sink. We next investigated whether a functional semi-synthetic ς70 could be obtained by expressed protein ligation. Genetic and biochemical data indicate that in the context of bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme, protein-DNA contacts between the evolutionary conserved C-terminal region 4.2 of ς70 and the −35 promoter element are crucial for promoter recognition (24Burton Z. Burgess R.R. Lin J. Moore D. Holder S. Gross C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 2889-2903Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 25Gardella T. Moyle T. Susskind M.M. J. Mol.

In addition, protein-protein contacts between ς region 4.2 and transcription factors are crucial for transcription activation (27Kumar A. Grimes B. Fujita N. Makino K. Malloch R.A. Hayward R.S. Ishihama A. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar,28Li M. Muyle H. Susskind M.M. Science. 1994; 263: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, we decided to focus our efforts on the semi-synthesis of a ς70 analog containing a chemically synthesized region 4.2. A recombinant protein containing the first 566 amino acids of ς70 fused to intein-CBD was used in the ligation reaction. This fragment was chosen because the region of ς70 defined by residues 560–570 is evolutionarily variable in length and sequence (29Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar) and is likely to tolerate a non-natural cysteine introduced as a result of ligation. Sequence comparisons also indicate that region 4.2 does not extend past ς70 His600 on the C-terminal side (29Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Based on these data, a 34-residue peptide was synthesized that corresponded to amino acids 568–600 of ς70 with an additional cysteine residue at the N terminus to promote ligation. Chemical ligation of the synthetic 34-mer to the 568-residue recombinant protein (residues 1–566 of ς70 + Ala-Gly) was carried out using the general conditions described above. As a control, a second reaction was performed in the absence of the synthetic peptide and thus should have contained the cleavage product only. Analysis of the crude reaction mixtures by SDS-PAGE showed the presence of the expected ∼70- and ∼65-kDa bands in the ligation and control reactions, respectively (Fig. 2 A). As in the model studies, the crude ligation reaction was essentially free of unligated material, although the mixture did contain a contaminant band at around 55 kDa (labeled ςX on Fig. 2 A, see below). The bacteriophage T4 anti-sigma protein, AsiA, engineered with a C-terminal hexahistidine tag was used in a Ni2+-NTA-agarose co-immobilization assay to investigate the binding of the ligation product, the cleavage product, and the full-length recombinant ς70 to AsiA (Fig. 2 A). A mixture of AsiAHis and recombinant ς70 was loaded onto Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (lane 4), and the unbound material was removed (lane 5). The beads were subsequently washed with 10 mm imidazole buffer and then eluted with 100 mm imidazole buffer. Both ς70 and AsiAHis were found in eluted fractions (lane 6). Since recombinant ς70 in the absence of AsiAHis did not interact with the beads (lane 3), we conclude that ς70 was retained on the beads through direct protein-protein interaction with AsiAHis, as expected (16Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyö D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). When a mixture of AsiAHis and the cleavage product, containing the first 566 amino acids of ς70, was loaded onto Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (lane 7), all of the ς70 fragment appeared in the unbound fraction (lane 8), whereas an analogous experiment with the ligation product indicated interaction of the semi-synthetic 602-amino acid long ς70 derivative with AsiAHis (lane 12). In the absence of AsiAHis, semi-synthetic ς70 did not interact with the Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads (lane 15). The crude cleavage and ligation reactions each contain an additional protein (labeled ςX on Fig. 2 A) that migrates faster than either the expected cleavage or ligation products. The appearance of this band is dependent on the addition of ς-intein overproducing lysates to the chitin beads, and we conclude that this band is probably a product of ς proteolysis. As this ς fragment may interfere with the function of the desired ligation product, we removed it using the AsiA immobilization method described above (see “Experimental Procedures”). When the purified ligation product and the corresponding amount of the cleavage product were combined withE. coli RNA polymerase core, the resulting holoenzymes were active on the galP1 promoter as was the holoenzyme reconstituted with full-length recombinant ς70 (Fig. 2 B). The galP1 promoter belongs to the “extended −10” promoter class and is active even in the absence of sigma region 4.2 (30Kumar A. Malloch R.A. Fujita N. Smillie D.A. Ishihama A. Hayward R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). From this experiment we conclude that both the cleavage and the ligation products retained their biological activity during the overnight incubation with thiophenol. A similar experiment was repeated on the T7 A2 promoter. T7 A2 is a strong promoter of the “−10/−35 class” and requires interaction between ς region 4.2 and the −35 box for its activity. As can be seen from the autoradiogram shown on Fig. 2 C the holoenzyme reconstituted with the ligation product was almost as active as the holoenzyme reconstituted with the full-length recombinant ς70. In contrast, the holoenzyme reconstituted with the cleavage product was completely unable to support transcription by the core enzyme on T7 A2 (lane 3). We conclude that the semi-synthetic, 602-amino acid long ς70 derivative is functional in promoter-dependent transcription. The results also establish, as expected, that the non-natural cysteine introduced at the ligation site does not interfere with ς70 function and, in agreement with the data of Kumar et al. (30Kumar A. Malloch R.A. Fujita N. Smillie D.A. Ishihama A. Hayward R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 406-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), that the last 13 amino acids of ς70 are not necessary for unregulated transcription. The results presented in Fig. 2 Ademonstrate that ς70 amino acids 568–600 are necessary for AsiA binding. In order to show that ς70 amino acids 558–600 are also sufficient for interaction with AsiA, we performed a Ni2+-NTA-agarose co-immobilization experiment with the synthetic ς 33-mer. Two different experiments were performed, and the same result was obtained. The first experiment was essentially a repetition of the experiment shown in Fig. 2 A and demonstrated that the synthetic 33-mer can be immobilized on Ni2+-NTA-agarose through AsiAHis (data not shown). The complementary experiment was done using wild type, untagged AsiA. Instead, a synthetic hexahistidine tag was chemically ligated to the N terminus of ς568–600 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” AsiA and His-tagged ς fragment were loaded on Ni2+-NTA beads; the beads were washed and eluted with increasing concentrations of imidazole in the buffer. As can be seen, AsiA was found in the fractions containing elevated concentrations of imidazole, and the elution profiles of AsiA and His-tagged ς568–600 from Ni2+-NTA-agarose beads were identical, indicating strong interaction (Fig. 3). A control experiment showed that AsiA did not interact with Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Ref. 16Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyö D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar and data not shown). We conclude that ς70 amino acids 568–600 are sufficient for interaction with AsiA. Expressed protein ligation is a novel approach that allows synthetic peptides to be chemically ligated to the C terminus of recombinant proteins fused to an intein protein splicing element (2Muir T.W. Sondhi D. Cole P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; (in press)Google Scholar). Based on the requirement for an N-terminal cysteine within the synthetic peptide, as well as the known involvement of thioesters in protein splicing (21Xu M.-Q. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5146-5153Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), it is assumed that the process involves a native chemical ligation (14Dawson P.E. Muir T.W. Clark-Lewis I. Kent S.B.H. Science. 1994; 266: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (3175) Google Scholar) step. This has been confirmed in the present study through a series of model studies which, moreover, indicate a phenyl α-thioester derivative of the recombinant protein to be the key reactive species in the process. This thioester derivative is also believed to be generated quite slowly during the process, meaning that the ligation reaction is probably pseudo-first order with the synthetic peptide being present in huge excess at any given time (Fig. 1). We also describe the preparation, using this new approach, of a 602-amino acid long semi-synthetic ς70 protein with an intact biological function. This molecule was used to map the determinants of AsiA binding within amino acids 568–600 of ς70. Our result is in excellent agreement with that of Colland et al. (31Colland F. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Buc H. Kolb A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), who used hydroxyl radical protein-protein footprinting to demonstrate that the only region of ς70 that is protected from radical cleavage by AsiA is located between residues 572 and 588. ς70 amino acids 568–600 comprise the evolutionarily conserved region 4.2 of the ς family of proteins. This region is thought to assume a helix-turn-helix conformation and to interact directly with the −35 box of the promoter. The present results, taken together with our finding that the binding of region 4.2 to the −35 box or AsiA is mutually exclusive, 2E. Severinova, K. Severinov, and S. A. Darst, submitted for publication. suggests that AsiA may inhibit transcription directly, by occluding the DNA binding surface region 4.2. The results presented here illustrate the enormous potential of the expressed protein ligation technique for exploring the mechanism and regulation of complex biomolecular machines. In the case of E. coli RNA polymerase, we have demonstrated that the ligation conditions do not destroy protein function and that semi-synthetic ς70 subunits can be reconstituted with the RNA polymerase core enzyme to give a fully functional holoenzyme. The stage is thus set for future studies in which biochemical and biophysical probes are site-specifically introduced into the ς70 subunit. For example, we are currently site-specifically introducing cross-linkable probes into semi-synthetic ς70. Promoter complexes formed by RNA polymerase holoenzymes reconstituted with derivatized, cross-linkable sigmas will allow us to study protein-protein and protein-nucleic acids contacts that govern transcription activation and promoter recognition. Finally, it is worth noting that other semi-synthetic subunits of the E. coli RNA polymerase complex can be reconstituted in vitro, 3K. Severinov, unpublished observations. suggesting expressed protein ligation will have widespread utility in this multiprotein system. K.

The receptor belongs to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that are involved in regulation of numerous biological processes.

Spontaneous and ligand-induced internalization controls the number of functionally active GPCR on the plasma membrane. Although the antiviral activity of chemokines is clearly linked to their ability to bind to the HIV-1 co-receptors, the specific mechanisms of this effect are poorly characterized. It was recently shown that CXCR4 undergoes SDF-1α-induced internalization in CEM cells (12Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwarz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), but localization and spontaneous trafficking of the receptor in different cell types were not addressed, and the mechanisms of receptor internalization and recycling were not characterized. Here we describe CXCR4 localization and trafficking in live U-937, CEM, HeLa, and NIH/3T3 cells, studied with the help of CXCR4-GFP fusion protein. Attachment of GFP did not influence the ability of CXCR4 to mediate HIV entry. CXCR4-GFP allowed for the first time the characterization of receptor localization and distribution inside the living cells, thereby avoiding possible artifacts caused by fixation and cell permeabilization. The present study provides evidence that the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 is a high affinity ligand of CXCR4 and that SDF-1α and gp120 induce endocytosis of CXCR4 that is significantly irreversible.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsRhodamine red concanavalin A (ConA), tetramethylrhodamine-transferrin, hexyl ester of rhodamine 6G, MitoTracker Red CMXRos, and LysoTracker Red dye were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc.

The controls for specificity included incubation with nonimmune serum, omission of the first antibodies, and staining of nonpermeabilized cells.DISCUSSIONIntracellular trafficking of GPCR is an important cellular mechanism of receptor activity regulation because it determines the number of receptor molecules present on the plasma membrane. Structurally homologous receptors may differ markedly in the pathways of trafficking (20Von Zastow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766PubMed Google Scholar), and trafficking of the same GPCR can be significantly different in different cell types (11Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A.

We have undertaken a detailed study of trafficking of CXCR4 in cells of different types and in the cells exposed to chemokine and viral ligands to assess the role of receptor pathways in receptor function and inhibition of HIV infection.Fusing the C terminus of GFP was found previously to produce fully functional cholecystokinin (CCKAR) (11Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L. Pavlakis G.N. Michejda C.J. Wank S.A. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This approach allowed for a study of receptor endocytosis, sorting from the ligand and recycling in real time in live cells (11Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L. Pavlakis G.N. Michejda C.J. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14817-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similarly, CXCR4-GFP was found fully functional in mediating HIV entry into the cells.Like CCKAR, CXCR4-GFP was distributed evenly along the cell membrane, suggesting that there is no preassociation of the receptor molecules with certain parts of membranes. The small number of receptors found in the endoplasmic reticulum most probably represented the pool of newly synthesized molecules that were not yet transported to the plasma membrane. Overexpression of CCKAR-GFP led to saturation of all intracellular membranes with receptor molecules. Thus, the absence of CXCR4-GFP in mitochondria is indicative of a lack of receptor overexpression in the studied cell lines.CXCR4 was found to undergo significant spontaneous endocytosis in all the cell lines examined, and the process was more important than what had been observed for the cholecystokinin receptor (11Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L. Pavlakis G.N. Michejda C.J. Wank S.A. J. Biol.

Michejda, and N. I. Tarasova, unpublished observation. in the same cell lines. Spontaneous endocytosis was independent of the level of receptor expression. The degree of spontaneous endocytosis varied significantly in different cell types, being highest for all three receptors (CXCR4, CCR5, and CCKAR) in NIH/3T3 cells, where almost no CXCR4 molecules could be detected on the cellular membrane. Thus, spontaneous endocytosis may account for very low or no cell surface expression of CXCR4 in some cell lines. CXCR4 mRNA has been reported to be widely expressed in leukocytes and related cell lines, yet SDF-1α acts only on certain leukocyte subsets (8Bleul C.C. Fuhlbrigge R.C. Casanovas J.M. Aiuti A. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar, 10Bleul C.C. Wu L. Hoxie J.A. Springer T.A. Mackay C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1925-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar). One can speculate that cell surface receptors in certain cell types may be down-regulated by spontaneous endocytosis to the levels that do not allow detectable cellular responses.Like many other GPCRs, cell surface CXCR4 undergoes ligand-induced internalization. We found that endocytosis was the predominant mechanism of CXCR4 internalization, although we cannot exclude the possibility that other mechanisms, such as internalization through noncoated pits, exist as minor components.We have found previously that the cholecystokinin receptors sort very efficiently from the ligands in endosomes, recycle with almost 100% efficiency, and could not be detected in lysosomes (11Tarasova N.I. Stauber R.H. Choi J.K. Hudson E.A. Czerwinski G. Miller J.L. Pavlakis G.N. Michejda C.J. Wank S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14817-14824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similarly, the CXCR4 receptor was suggested previously to recycle to the plasma membrane in CEM cells after removal of the ligand from the incubation medium (12Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwarz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.-L. Arenzana-Seisdedos F. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that recycling of CXCR4 is not efficient, and, unlike CCKAR, a significant portion of CXCR4 molecules could be detected in lysosomes after addition of the ligand. Interestingly, no CXCR4 could be detected in lysosomes in the absence of the ligands, suggesting that spontaneous endocytosis is not accompanied by receptor degradation, whereas ligand-induced endocytosis led to depletion of the cell surface of receptor molecules, and the process was irreversible in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. There was a slight variation in the degree of recycling in different cell lines, which was highest in HeLa cells. However, even in this cell line, not more than 30% of internalized receptor molecules made it back to the cell surface. Several other GPCR were reported to undergo partial recycling. hCG/LH (22Ghinea N. Hai M.T.V. Groyer-Picard M.-T. Houllier A. Schoevaert D. Milgrom E. J. Cell. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 512-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) receptors also appeared to be targeted to the degradative pathway.Targeting of CXCR4 to lysosomes and only partial recycling was observed in all of the cell lines examined, suggesting that the protective effect of the SDF-1α against HIV infection can be attributed not only to competition for binding to CXCR4 but also to depletion of the cell surface of the co-receptor molecules.The viral envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp160 were reported previously to bind to CXCR4 and compete with SDF-1α interaction (25Hesselgesser J. Halks-Miller M. DelVecchio V. Peiper S.C. Hoxie J. Kolson D.L. Taub D. Horuk R. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 112-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar,26Bandres J.C.

Our data demonstrate that gp120 is a high affinity ligand of CXCR4 and can be as potent as SDF-1α in inducing rapid endocytosis of cell surface CXCR4 both in the presence and in the absence of CD4. Down-regulation of the co-receptor by envelope protein that is shedded from the surface of infected cells can thus contribute significantly to the kinetics of infection and also to the selection of virus mutants with certain receptor and cell tropism. In addition, we have found recently that gp120 MN acts as an agonist in inducing CXCR4-mediated signal transduction, 3N. I. Tarasova and C. J. Michejda, unpublished observation. whereas gp120 LAV is an antagonist and inhibits SDF-1α-induced intracellular Ca2+ release. This observation suggests that the action of the viral envelope proteins on the cells can go beyond down-regulation of the chemokine receptors. A study of biological effects of different gp120 strains on different cell types is currently ongoing in our laboratory.

The receptor belongs to a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that are involved in regulation of numerous biological processes. G-protein-coupled receptor function is significantly regulated by receptor trafficking within the cell (9Bohm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). CXCR4 was shown to be expressed in a variety of cells, but the activity of SDF-1α on various cells varies significantly (8Bleul C.C.

We have shown previously that another GPCR, cholecystokinin receptor type A, undergoes spontaneous endocytosis that is cell type-dependent and may account for attenuation of receptor function in different cell populations (11Tarasova N.I.

Spontaneous and ligand-induced internalization controls the number of functionally active GPCR on the plasma membrane. Although the antiviral activity of chemokines is clearly linked to their ability to bind to the HIV-1 co-receptors, the specific mechanisms of this effect are poorly characterized. It was recently shown that CXCR4 undergoes SDF-1α-induced internalization in CEM cells (12Amara A. Le Gall S. Schwarz O. Salamero J. Montes M. Loetscher P. Baggiolini M. Virelizier J.-L.

Here we describe CXCR4 localization and trafficking in live U-937, CEM, HeLa, and NIH/3T3 cells, studied with the help of CXCR4-GFP fusion protein. Attachment of GFP did not influence the ability of CXCR4 to mediate HIV entry. CXCR4-GFP allowed for the first time the characterization of receptor localization and distribution inside the living cells, thereby avoiding possible artifacts caused by fixation and cell permeabilization.

We have recently established that RIZ1, but not RIZ2, expression was commonly decreased or lost in breast cancer, and forced RIZ1 expression caused cell cycle arrest in G2/M and/or apoptosis. 3L.

Yang, A. Nakagawara, G. M. Brodeur, Y. E. Shi, and S. Huang, submitted for publication. Recent investigation shows that the PR domain of RIZ1 has neither a transcriptional repressor nor activator function (28Xie M. Shao G. Buyse I.M. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26360-26366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although full-length RIZ gene products function in both transcription activation (21Muraosa Y. Takahashi K. Yoshizawa M. Shibahara S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and repression (28Xie M. Shao G. Buyse I.M. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26360-26366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Both RIZ1 and RIZ2 bind to GC-rich Sp-1-like DNA elements and repress transcription of the simian virus 40 early promoter, but RIZ1 is a more potent repressor than RIZ2, suggesting that the PR domain of RIZ1 modulates transcription (28Xie M. Shao G. Buyse I.M. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26360-26366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). MDS1-EVI1 is recently shown to act as a transcriptional activator, whereas EVI1 as a repressor; the activation domain of MDS1-EVI1 maps to the PR domain (47Soderholm J. Kobayashi H. Mathieu C. Rowley J.D. Nucifora G. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although these studies shed light on understanding PR domain function, no biochemical activities have been described for this important domain. Conserved motifs found in transcription factors generally function in binding to DNA and/or to polypeptides. We have generated purified recombinant fusion proteins of RIZ1 PR domain and used these proteins to examine whether this domain serves as a polypeptide binding interface. We found that PR domain polypeptides interact with in vitro translated RIZ1 or RIZ2 proteins. The binding appears to be specific, as it can be disrupted by specific mutations in the PR domain. A region in the carboxyl terminus of RIZ proteins was mapped to be necessary and sufficient for PR binding. The results demonstrate that the PR domain of RIZ1 mediates protein-protein interaction. We also found that the PR domain shares significant sequence identity to the SET domain present in chromosomal proteins that function in modulating gene expression from yeast to mammals. Our data suggest that the PR domain is a derivative of SET domain and may function as the protein binding interface in the regulation of chromatin-mediated gene expression. The RIZ1 PR domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein by using the pGEX-KG vector as described previously (8Buyse I.M. Shao G. Huang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4467-4471Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). A HincII-StuI PR domain fragment corresponding to residues 37–214 of rat RIZ1 cDNA was subcloned into the blunted NcoI site in pGEX-KG to generate pGST-RIZ1-PRB. To remove non-PR domain sequences in pGST-RIZ1-PRB, a PCR fragment was amplified using pGST-RIZ1-PRB as a template with primer GEX2T.1 (5′-CTGGTTCCGCGTGGATCC-3′) and primer RP197 (5′-GGAAGCTTCACAGATGCTCTTCTAGACTTCTTCCCTCTGCGGCTCTT-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pGEX-KG to generate pGST-RIZ1-PR (aa 37–172). Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the PR domain to generate pGST-RIZ1-L104A using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The two Leu at position 104–105 in Fig. 1 were changed to Ala. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CCTGGCGAGGAGGCCGCGGTCTGGTACAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTGTACCAGACCGCGGCCTCCTCGCCAGG-3′. For deletion of coding exon 5 or block C of PR domain, an Spe1 linker (5′-CTAGACTAGTCTAG-3′) was inserted into the SacI site in the pGST-RIZ1-PR construct to generate pGST-RIZ1-PRΔC (express aa 37–135). Coding exon 4 or block B (aa 77–127) deletion construct pGST-RIZ1-PRΔB was generated by replacing the PR domain insert in GST-RIZ1-PR with an reverse transcription-PCR fragment lacking exon 4. The RNA used for reverse transcription-PCR was prepared from brain tissues of a mutant mouse line homozygous for an in-frame deletion of exon 4. 4G. Steele-Perkins and S. Huang, unpublished data. The primers used were RP244 (5′-TATCCATGGACAAGACTCGGATTGGTGTCTGGGCCACTAAAC-3′) and RP197. Coding exon 3 or block A (aa 37–76) deletion construct pGST-RIZ1-PRΔA was generated by cloning a PCR fragment of pGST-RIZ1-PR into theXbaI and HindIII sites in pGEX-KG using primer RP231 (5′-AGGTGTATTACCCAAATTTGGG-3′) and primer RP200 (5′-GGAAGCTTCACAGATGCTCTTCTAGACTTCTTCCCTCTGCGGCTCTT-3′). Plasmids p3RIZr, pCMVRIZ, and p3RIZrKK for producing RIZ1 and RIZ2 products by in vitro transcription/translation have been described previously (13Liu L. Shao G. Steele-Perkins G. Huang S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2984-2991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because yield of in vitrotranscription/translation products from p3RIZrKK plasmid was low, we constructed another RIZ2 expression plasmid, p3RIZrΔK. This plasmid was derived from p3RIZr by the deletion of a 5′ fragment ofHindIII-KpnI of rat RIZ1 cDNA. This deletion removed the ATG codon for RIZ1 but retained all downstream in-frame ATG codons. Transient transfection of p3RIZrΔK plasmid into 3T3 cells generated full-length RIZ2 protein at similar levels as that produced from p3RIZrKK. To generate in vitro translation product of the PR domain, a 0.6-kilobase pair HindIII-StuI fragment of pCMVRIZ was cloned into the HindIII and bluntedXbaI sites in pcDNA3; a Spe1 linker (5′-CTAGACTAGTCTAG-3′) with stop codons was then inserted into theApaI site to generate p3RIZ1PR. Plasmid p3RIZrΔNB was generated to express the carboxyl-terminal half of RIZ1 protein (aa 900–1706) by in-frame deletion of the amino-terminal region from NcoI to BstEII in p3RIZr. Plasmid p3RIZrBB was produced to express aa 900 to 1272 by cloning the BstEII to BamHI fragment into pcDNA3. Plasmid p3RIZrΔNBam was generated to express the carboxyl-terminal region (aa 1272–1706) by in-frame deletion of the amino-terminal region from NcoI to BamHI in p3RIZr. The following enzymes were used to digest the construct p3RIZ1ΔNBam to generate carboxyl-terminal truncation mutants forin vitro translation: EcoRI, ApaI, andNsi1. For constructing GST fusion proteins of the carboxyl-terminal region pGST-hRIZ1–1514-1680, human RIZ1 cDNA was PCR-amplified using primers RP252 (5′-GCATGAATTCGCAGACGGACAGCGGAT-3′) and RP253 (5′-TACGAAGCTTCTAGCTGAAGTCCTTCAGCTC-3′). The PCR fragment was cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites in pGEX-KG vector. This region of human RIZ1 protein corresponds to aa 1502–1668 of rat RIZ1 protein. Expression of the recombinant proteins from plasmids bearing log-phase Escherichia coli XL1-blue cells was induced with 0.4 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and bacterial culture proceeded for 3 h at 30 °C. Protein extract was made, and recombinant GST fusion protein was purified as described (29Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to purify various GST fusion proteins from E. coli cell extracts. In some experiments, the protein-loaded beads were then incubated with in vitrotranslated products. Alternatively, the purified proteins or bacterial cell extracts were first mixed with in vitro translation products produced by the TNT lysate (Promega). The mixture was then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B. Binding and washing buffers are the same: 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm of dithiothreitol, aprotinin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. After washing 4×, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis. The electrophoretic patterns were visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue or autoradiography. The peptide sequence of the PR domain of RIZ1 was used as a query to search the nonredundant protein data base of NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information). The position-specific-iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) program for motif-style searching was used, which is more sensitive to distant relationships (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). RIZ gene contains eight coding exons, and the seventh coding exon encodes the majority of RIZ1 protein (85.6%) (Fig. 1 A). The PR domain is encoded by three small exons, coding exons 3–5. Each exon in PR contains a conserved block of residues, designated A,B, or C in Fig. 1 B. The PR domain is located in the amino-terminal 200-amino acid region of RIZ1 consisting of coding exons 1–6 (Fig. 1 A). This entire sequence is absent in RIZ2 protein (Fig. 1 A). This region is thus expected to confer RIZ1 specific functions. To help study activities of this amino-terminal region and in particular the PR domain, two different GST fusion proteins were produced in E. coli and purified (Fig. 2). GST-RIZ1-PRB protein (rat RIZ1 residues 37–214) contains most of the amino-terminal 200-amino acid sequence consisting of part of coding exon 2 and entire coding exons 3–6. This protein could be used to examine the function of the amino-terminal region including PR and its proximal sequences. GST-RIZ1-PR protein (residues 37–172) contains the minimal PR domain sequence as defined by homology with other PR domain genes and consists of part of coding exon 2 and entire coding exons 3–5. This protein could be used to examine the function of PR only. The conserved motifs of many transcription factors are known to mediate homo-oligomeric interactions. We therefore examined whether PR could interact with RIZ1 protein. GST fusion proteins as shown in Fig. 2 B were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. The protein-loaded beads were then incubated with radiolabeled in vitro translated RIZ1 protein. Binding (approximately 10% of input RIZ1 protein was bound) was observed for either GST-RIZ1-PR- or GST-RIZ1-PRB-loaded beads (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 1to lane 3 or 4), whereas no binding was found for the GST protein-loaded beads (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). These results suggest that the amino-terminal 214-amino acid region of RIZ1 participates in protein-protein interactions between RIZ1 molecules. Binding to RIZ1 was demonstrated even for the minimal PR domain. Similarly, in vitro translated RIZ2 product also bound to GST-RIZ1-PR- or -PRB-loaded beads (Fig. 3 A, lanes 5–8). The binding of PR to RIZ2 appeared to be comparable with binding to RIZ1, indicating that PR homo-oligomeric interaction, if there is any, is not essential for homo-oligomeric binding of RIZ proteins. To confirm that the PR motif does not strongly interact with itself, in vitro translated, radiolabeled PR domain product (residues 37–214) was examined for binding to GST-RIZ1-PR protein. Approximately 1% of input protein was bound, which is significantly weaker than PR-RIZ1 or PR-RIZ2 interactions (Fig. 3 B). The results suggest a weak homo-oligomeric interaction of PR. However, such weak interaction is probably not responsible for the strong binding observed in Fig. 2. To better characterize the observed protein binding activity of PR, deletion and missense mutations were introduced into the GST-RIZ1-PR protein construct. To assess the role of each conserved exon in PR activity, mutants deleting each exon were constructed and expressed inE. coli. To assess the binding specificity and the role of some of the conserved amino acid residues, amino acid substitutions were introduced into conserved positions in exon 5, changing two Leu residues at position 104–105 to Ala (PR-L104A/L105A). These mutant proteins as shown in Fig. 4 Awere used for binding to in vitro translated RIZ1 protein. As shown in Fig. 4 B, deletion of exon 5 disrupted binding (GST-RIZ1-PRdelC), but deletion of exon 3 and 4 did not significantly affect binding (GST-RIZ1-PRdelA and -delB). The mutant protein with substitutions of leucines for alanines at residues 104–105 located in exon 5 also disrupted binding, further suggesting a requirement for exon 5 in binding. These data implicate the functions of the PR domain in RIZ protein-protein interactions. To further map the PR binding motif of RIZ proteins, truncation mutants of RIZ1 were generated by in vitro transcription and translation of various mutant constructs (Fig. 5 A). Truncated RIZ proteins were examined for binding to GST-RIZ1-PR protein. The carboxyl-terminal half (residues 900–1706, p3RIZrΔNB) strongly bound to PR (about 10% of input RIZ was bound), whereas the amino-terminal half showed only weak binding (approximately 1% of input RIZ) (Fig. 5 B). The weak binding of PR to the amino-terminal half of RIZ1 is consistent with the weak PR-homo-oligomeric interactions already described and presented in Fig. 3 B. Once the PR binding motif was indicated in the carboxyl-terminal half of RIZ1, deletion mutants of p3RIZrΔNB were generated by in vitro transcription and translation. A fragment encompassing residues 900 to 1272 (construct p3RIZrBB) did not bind to GST-PR, but a fragment encoding residues 1272 to the end codon 1706 (construct p3RIZrΔNBam) retained full PR binding activity. This result narrows the PR binding motif to within the carboxyl-terminal 434-amino acid region (aa 1272–1706) (Fig. 5 C). Further deletion analysis of this carboxyl-terminal region represented by p3RIZrΔNBam was performed (Fig. 5 D). Deletion of residues 1636–1706 (p3RIZrΔNBam cut by ApaI) or 1563 to 1706 (p3RIZrΔNBam cut by EcoRI) did not affect binding, but deletion of residues 1489–1706 (p3RIZrΔNBam cut by NsiI) disrupted binding. The results suggest that the region from amino acid 1489 to 1563 of rat RIZ1 is required for binding to PR. To address whether this carboxyl-terminal region is also sufficient for binding to PR, a GST fusion protein of this region of human RIZ1, pGST-hRIZ1(1514–1680) (equivalent to rat RIZ1 protein residues 1502–1668), was constructed, expressed in E. coli., and purified (Fig. 6 A). This fusion protein was examined for binding to in vitrotranslated PR protein. Efficient binding of PR (about 10% input PR protein) to pGST-hRIZ1(1514–1680) but not to GST protein was observed (Fig. 6 B). The results show that RIZ1 PR binding motif is located at the carboxyl-terminal region between amino acids 1514 and 1680. To better understand the biological functions of PR domain, we searched the NCBI data base for protein sequences that may share similarity to the PR domain. PSI-BLAST is a recently developed program to help delineate diverse protein families and to predict function for proteins (30Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). PSI-BLAST uses an initial BLAST run to generate a gapped multiple alignment. It then constructs from this alignment a position-specific score matrix, which is employed as a “query” in a subsequent BLAST search. This process can be repeated multiple times to hunt for homologous sequences that would not have been retrieved by the original BLAST algorithm. We used the PR domain peptide sequence of RIZ1 as thequery and performed PSI-BLAST searches of the nonredundant protein data base of NCBI. All known PR genes as well as two C. elegans open reading frames (F25D7 and T21B10) were identified with Evalues below 5 × 10−10, demonstrating the power of the PSI-BLAST program. The next level of significant matches were found for the SET domain present in G9a, ASH1, Su(Var)3–9, and SET1 proteins with E values ranging from 0.003 to 1.9. The SET domain is a 130-amino acid, evolutionarily conserved sequence motif present in chromosomal proteins that function in modulating gene activities from yeast to mammals (31Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 32Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the shared residues between PR and SET are also among the most conserved residues in each domain, suggesting they may share a common function (Fig. 7). One of the two conserved Leu residues required for RIZ1 PR protein binding activity as shown in Fig. 4 is also conserved in the SET domain. Despite the similarity between PR and SET, which is typically ∼20% identical in amino acids, they are clearly distinctive, because identities among PR genes are typically ∼45% and among SET genes, ∼50%. Also, SET domains are primarily found at the carboxyl termini of proteins, whereas PR domains are mostly located at the amino termini. PR domains are primarily associated with zinc finger proteins, whereas SET domains have been found in a variety of proteins containing various motifs, including the chromo domain, A/T hooks, zinc finger, PHD fingers, and GTP binding motifs (32Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Finally, PR domain is not found in yeast genome and is likely a derivative of SET domain in evolution. RIZ1 is identical to RIZ2, except that it has an extra 200 residues at the amino terminus. These extra residues may confer specific function to RIZ1 protein. The PR domain represents the major functional motif within the RIZ1 amino-terminal region. We found that at least one function of this region is to serve as a protein binding interface. GST fusion proteins containing most of the RIZ1 amino terminus from 37–214 showed similar activities as the minimal PR motif from residues 37–172, suggesting that the PR domain is the protein binding motif contained in the amino-terminal region. The protein binding function of RIZ1 PR is specific, as evidenced by disruption of function by mutations. It is interesting to note that deletion of coding exon 3 or 4 did not significantly affect PR binding to RIZ proteins, even though both exons encode conserved sequences. In contrast, exon 5 is required, as deletion or point mutation within this exon disrupted binding. The observation suggests a modular nature of PR domain action. It is probable that an individual conserved block of PR may possess independent functional activities that are independent of other blocks. Novel activities may also derive from combinations of these blocks. The mapping of a PR binding motif to a carboxyl-terminal region of RIZ1 represents the identification of a novel motif in this multidomain protein. This motif appears not well conserved among PR genes, as data base searches did not reveal any proteins with significant similarity. Nevertheless, the observation raises the possibility that PR could be engaged in either intermolecular interactions or intramolecular interactions. Which type of interaction would dominate may depend on other protein-protein interactions. Interaction of PR domain with the carboxyl domain could occur as an intramolecular interaction in full-length RIZ1 but not in RIZ2. Homo-oligomerization between RIZ1 molecules or heter-oligmerization between RIZ1 and RIZ2 could be driven by this binding contact. It is also possible that both PR and the carboxyl-terminal PR binding motif of RIZ1 may interact with other as yet unidentified proteins. Understanding this complex network of interactions in vivo represents an important future goal. That PR domain is related to the SET domain is a provocative finding. SET domain genes have diverse biological functions related to chromatin structure and play an important role in development, cancer, position-effect-variegation, telomeric and centromeric gene silencing, and possibly in determining chromosome architecture (32Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). They are multifunctional chromatin regulators with activities in both eu- and heterochromatin. The founding members of the family include threeDrosophila genes: the strongest position-effect-variegation suppressor gene Su(Var)3–9 (31Tschiersch B. Hofmann A. Krauss V. Dorn R. Korge G. Reuter G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3822-3831Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), the polycomb group geneEnhancer of zeste (33Jones R.S. Gelbart W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6357-6366Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and the trithorax group genetrithorax (34Kennison J.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Other prominent members include theSaccharomyces cerevisiae SET1 gene which affects mating-type switching and telomeric silencing (35Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), the Schizosaccharomyces pombe Clr4+ gene, which is involved in centromere function (36Ekwall K. Nimmo E.R. Javerzat J.P. Borgstrom B. Egel R. Cranston G. Allshire R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2637-2648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the human trithorax homolog HRX (also calledALL-1 and MLL), which is a breakpoint gene involved in human leukemia (37Tkachuk D.C. Kohler S. Cleary M.L. Cell. 1992; 71: 691-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 38Gu Y. Nakamura T. Alder H. Prasad R. Canaani O. Cimino G. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Cell. 1992; 71: 701-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 39Djabali M. Selleri L. Parry P. Bower M. Young B.D. Evans G.A. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The SET domain alone can replace the full-length SET1 protein in mediating telomeric gene silencing, suggesting a direct and important role of SET in heterochromatin regulation (35Nislow C. Ray E. Pillus L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2421-2436Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, a DNA or chromatin binding activity for the SET domain is highly unlikely, because point mutations in the cysteine-rich cluster in Enhancer of zeste or a truncation of the PHD finger in ASH1 disrupt polytene association, despite the presence of unaltered SET domains in the respective proteins (32Jenuwein T. Laible G. Dorn R. Reuter G. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1998; 54: 80-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In support of this, our observations here directly implicate the SET domain in protein-protein interaction. We suggest that SET and PR domains may function to assemble chromatin-based multiprotein complexes involved in either euchromatin-mediated gene activation or heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. Lack or inactivation of SET or PR domain in a gene may specifically inactivate the chromatin-associated functions of the gene without affecting the other functions of the gene such as DNA binding and chromatin-independent transcriptional activation or repression. Chromatin regulation may therefore represent a drastic functional difference between a PR-plus product and a PR-minus product of a PR gene, which may underlie the apparently opposite roles of these products in tumorigenesis. Consistent with the notion that PR domain family is a derivative of SET domain family, PR genes share certain biological functions with SET genes. The MDS1-EVI1 gene is involved in development (40Hoyt P.R. Bartholomew C. Davis A.J. Yutzey K. Gamer L.W. Potter S.S. Ihle J.N. Mucenski M.L. Mech. Dev. 1997; 65: 55-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and human leukemia similar to HRX. Inactivation ofHRX has been found in certain solid tumors, suggesting it may act as a negative regulator of tumorigenesis (41Baffa R. Negrini M. Schichman S.A. Huebner K. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4922-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PR genes are known to repress transcription, a feature shared by many SET genes that function in heterochromatin-mediated gene silencing. Future studies are expected to generate more similarities in the biochemical and biological functions of these genes, although differences may also be expected since PR and SET are clearly two separate motifs. That the Rb-binding protein RIZ1 is likely to function in chromatin regulation further implicates a role for Rb in regulating chromatin-mediated gene expression. Several other Rb-binding proteins are known to function in chromatin modulation, including human histone deacetylase (42Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

After submission of this manuscript, three reports have been published describing SET domain function in protein-protein interactions (Rozenblattrosen, O., Rozovskaia, T., Burakov, D., Sedkov, Y., Tillib, S., Blechman, J., Nakamura, T., Croce, C.

The SET domain of HRX(ALL1) is shown to interact with INI1 and SNR1 proteins of the SWI/SNF complex involved in chromatin remodeling (Rozenblattrosenet al.) and the myotubularin family of dual specificity protein phosphatases (Cui et al.).

Tax-induced breakdown of IκBα requires phosphorylation of the inhibitor at Ser-32 and Ser-36, which is also a prerequisite for the transient activation of NF-κB in cytokine-treated T lymphocytes. However, it remained unclear how Tax interfaces with the cellular NF-κB/IκB signaling machinery to generate a chronic rather than a transient NF-κB response. We now demonstrate that Tax associates with cytokine-inducible IκB kinase (IKK) complexes containing catalytic subunits IKKα and IKKβ, which mediate phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36. Unlike their transiently activated counterparts in cytokine-treated cells, Tax-associated forms of IKK are constitutively active in either Tax transfectants or HTLV1-infected T lymphocytes. Moreover, point mutations in Tax that ablate its IKK-binding function also prevent Tax-mediated activation of IKK and NF-κB. Together, these findings suggest that the persistent activation of NF-κB in HTLV1-infected T-cells is mediated by a direct Tax/IKK coupling mechanism.

The NF-κB/Rel family of transcription factors plays an important regulatory role in T-cell homeostasis and antigen-driven proliferation (1Köntgen F. Grumont R.J. Strasser A. Metcalf D. Li R.

In response to mitogenic signals, IκBα is targeted for destruction by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and then NF-κB translocates to the nucleus (6May S.J. Ghosh S. Immunol.

The HTLV1 provirus encodes a 40-kDa oncoprotein, termed Tax, which potently induces the constitutive nuclear expression of NF-κB (17Ballard D.W. Böhnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Wano Y. Franza B.R.

Studies with Tax-transgenic mice suggest that this viral/host interaction is required to maintain the transformed phenotype of HTLV1-infected cells (20Kitajima I. Shinohara T. Bilakovics J. Brown D.A. Xu X. Nerenberg M. Science. 1992; 258: 1792-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). We demonstrated recently that Tax converts IκBα into a labile proteasome substrate by a mechanism involving phosphorylation of the inhibitor at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (7Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C.

McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism by which Tax accesses the host NF-κB signaling pathway remained unknown. We demonstrate here that cytokine-inducible IκB kinases containing IKKα and IKKβ, which normally function in a transient manner (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

These activated forms of IKK associate stably with Tax when the oncoprotein is expressed in either transiently transfected or virally infected cells. Point mutations in Tax that ablate its NF-κB-inducing activity also prevent the formation of functional IKK/Tax complexes. Our findings suggest that Tax persistently activates IKK proteins via a direct binding mechanism, resulting in the sustained degradation of IκBα and chronic nuclear expression of NF-κB in HTLV1-infected cells. The anti-IKKα antiserum was generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 1–29 of human IKKα, which was covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. 2J.

Lysates were adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 250 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA before the addition of specific antisera. Immunoprecipitations were typically carried out in 300-μl reaction mixtures containing 200 μg of total cytoplasmic protein and 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed). Immunoprecipitates were washed with ELB buffer (7Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell.

Immunoreactive polypeptides were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IκB kinase activity was measured as described with slight modifications (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates were equilibrated in kinase buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmMnCl2, 12.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 μm Na3VO4, 2 mm NaF). Kinase reactions (20 μl) were initiated at 30 °C by the addition of 10 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), and 1 μg of recombinant GST protein fused to amino acids 1–54 of IκBα (GST-IκBα) (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). A substrate containing alanine replacements for Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα (GST-IκBαMU) was used to assess kinase specificity (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were terminated after 30 min by heat denaturation in the presence of 1% SDS. Radiolabeled phosphoproteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Whereas NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins, this transcription factor is persistently expressed in the nuclei of HTLV1-infected T-cells (17Ballard D.W. Böhnlein E. Lowenthal J.W. Wano Y. Franza B.R. Greene W.C. Science. 1988; 241: 1652-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 18Leung K. Nabel G.J.

Science. 1988; 241: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that Tax stimulates phosphorylation of the NF-κB inhibitor IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36, which targets it to the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (7Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M. Qi X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Scherer D.C. Brockman J.A. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα is also required for the transient activation of NF-κB in response to the cytokine TNF (7Brockman J.A.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As such, we reasoned that Tax might persistently activate an IKK, resulting in the sustained rather than transient nuclear action of NF-κB. In this regard, recent studies have identified a multisubunit IKK complex containing two interactive catalytic components, termed IKKα and IKKβ, which mediate site-specific phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 in TNF-treated cells (11Regnier C.H.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between these cytokine-inducible IKKs and Tax remained unknown. To explore this relationship, cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared from three HTLV1-transformed T-cell lines, including MT-2, SLB-1, and C8166. Whereas the MT-2 and SLB-1 lines produce replication-competent virions (25Miyoshi I. Kubonishi I. Yoshimoto S. Shiraishi Y. Gann. 1981; 72: 978-981PubMed Google Scholar, 26Koeffler H.P. Chen I.S. Golde D.W. Blood. 1984; 64: 482-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C8166 cells harbor a defective provirus that selectively expresses Tax (27Salahuddin S.Z. Markham P.D. Wong-Staal F. Franchini G. Kalyanaraman V.S. Gallo R.C. Virology. 1983; 129: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Subcellular extracts were also prepared from Jurkat T-cells, which are TNF-responsive (32Osborn L. Kunkel S. Nabel G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2336-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar) and transformed by an HTLV1-independent mechanism. As demonstrated in gel shift assays, treatment of Jurkat T-cells with TNF led to the rapid induction of NF-κB DNA binding activity in the nuclear compartment (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2, top panel). However, NF-κB was constitutively activated in each of the three HTLV1-infected lines (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–5, top panel). This constitutive pattern of nuclear NF-κB activity correlated with the expression of Tax protein in the cytoplasmic compartment of MT-2, SLB-1, and C8166 cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–5,bottom panel). To monitor IKK activity in HTLV1-infected cells, in vitrophosphorylation assays were performed using a GST-IκBα (amino acids 1–54) fusion protein as substrate (12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar). Endogenous IKKs were isolated by immunoprecipitation with either IKKα or IKKβ peptide-specific antisera and incubated with the GST-IκBα substrate and [γ-32P]ATP. Consistent with prior studies (11Regnier C.H. Song H.Y. Gao X. Goeddel D.V. Cao Z. Rothe M. Cell. 1997; 90: 373-383Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 12DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), IκB kinase activity directed by either IKKα or IKKβ in Jurkat T-cells was modestly stimulated by treatment with TNF for 10 min (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). However, in HTLV1-infected T-cells, IKKα- and IKKβ-associated kinase activities were constitutively expressed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3–5). These IKK activities were specific for Ser-32 and Ser-36 of IκBα, because replacement of both sites with alanine in the GST-IκBα substrate eliminated phosphoryl group transfer (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6–10). As demonstrated by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C), steady-state levels of the IKKα protein were reduced in HTLV1-infected cells relative to unstimulated Jurkat T-cells (top panel), whereas IKKβ protein expression was modestly elevated (bottom panel). These studies suggest that Tax persistently activates endogenous IKKs by a post-translational mechanism. Because the predominant form of IKK appears to be dependent on the activities of both IKKα and IKKβ (13Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), we infer that both of these interactive catalytic subunits are affected in cells harboring HTLV1. To explore the possibility that Tax persistently activates IKKs via specific protein/protein interactions, Tax was immunoprecipitated from the cytosol of HTLV1-infected T-cells and assayed for the presence of IκBα kinase activity. As shown in Fig. 2A, GST-IκBα phosphorylating activity was detected in Tax immunoprecipitates isolated from virally infected lymphocyte lines (lanes 2–4), but not in control immunoprecipitates derived from Jurkat T-cells (lane 1). The IκB kinase activity associated with Tax exhibited the appropriate sequence specificity, because disruption of Ser-32 and Ser-36 in IκBα eliminated phosphoryl group transfer (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5–8). These results suggest that Tax forms stable cytoplasmic complexes with active IKKs in HTLV1-infected T-cells. To determine whether either IKKα or IKKβ mediates this Tax-associated kinase activity, monoclonal anti-Tax antibodies were used to isolate cytoplasmic Tax from MT-2, SLB-1, and C8166 cells. Tax immunocomplexes were then fractionated by SDS-PAGE and probed on immunoblots with a mixture of IKKα and IKKβ peptide-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B (lanes 2–4), endogenous IKKα was detected in association with Tax in each of the HTLV1-infected cell lines tested, whereas a Tax-bound form of the IKKβ protein was also evident in SLB-1 cells. To extend these findings, we used peptide-specific antibodies to immunoprecipitate either IKKα or IKKβ from SLB-1 cells and then assayed for the presence of Tax in the resultant IKK immunocomplexes. Tax was readily detected in complexes containing either of these IKKs, albeit at higher levels in the IKKα immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 C,lanes 2 and 3). These results provide direct biochemical evidence that Tax associates stably with IKKs in HTLV1-infected cells. In light of these findings, we reasoned that the association of Tax with IKKs might be a prerequisite for IKK activation. To test this hypothesis, 293T cells were transfected with cDNA expression vectors for wild-type Tax (Tax-WT) and forms of the oncoprotein containing missense mutations that selectively disrupt its ability to access either the CREB/ATF (Tax-M47) or the NF-κB/Rel (Tax-M22) transcription factor pathway (23Smith M.R. Greene W.C. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1875-1885Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Subcellular extracts were then prepared and subjected to gel shift, co-immunoprecipitation, andin vitro phosphorylation analyses. As shown in Fig. 3 A (top panel), Tax-M22 failed to induce the nuclear expression of NF-κB DNA binding activity in transfected cells (lane 3), whereas wild-type Tax and the Tax-M47 mutant were fully competent to execute this function (lanes 2 and 4). All three of the Tax constructs were expressed at comparable levels in the cytosol of 293T transfectants (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). To assess the status of endogenous IKK activity in these Tax-expressing cells, cytoplasmic extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies for either Tax, IKKα, or IKKβ and the resultant immune complexes were monitored for GST-IκBα phosphorylating activity. As shown in Fig. 3 B (top panel), immune complexes containing either wild-type Tax or Tax-M47 possessed a significant level of IKK activity (lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, immunoprecipitates derived from cells transfected with either a blank expression vector or the Tax-M22 cDNA failed to affect GST-IκBα phosphorylation (lanes 1 and 3). Similar qualitative results were obtained in experiments conducted with IKKα (Fig. 3 B, middle panel) and IKKβ (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) immunoprecipitates, confirming that the mutation in Tax-M22 disrupted the functional interplay between Tax, IKK, and NF-κB. To determine whether the mutation in Tax-M22 affected its IKK-binding function, cytoplasmic extracts from these transfectants were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an IKKα-specific antiserum and resultant immune complexes were analyzed for the presence of either IKKα or Tax. Comparable amounts of endogenous IKKα protein were immunoprecipitated from cells overexpressing either wild-type Tax, Tax-M22, or Tax-M47 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2–4,top panel). Consistent with their capacity to activate both IKK and NF-κB, wild-type Tax and Tax-M47 were detected in association with IKKα (Fig. 3 C, lanes 2 and 4,bottom panel). However, formation of Tax/IKK complexes was not apparent in cells overexpressing Tax-M22, which fails to activate IKK and NF-κB (Fig. 3 C, lane 3, bottom panel). Taken together, these findings provide a strong correlation between the IKK-binding function of Tax and the ability of this oncoprotein to persistently activate IKK and NF-κB. The Tax protein of HTLV1 and the cytokine TNF both activate NF-κB by a mechanism involving signal-dependent phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (7Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A.

The IκBα gene is under NF-κB control, which provides a negative-feedback loop to ensure the transient action of NF-κB in TNF-treated cells (34Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 35Beg A. Sha W.C. Bronson R.T. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). In contrast, NF-κB appears to escape from feedback inhibition by newly synthesized IκBα in cells expressing Tax (22McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A Scherer D.C. Al-Murrani S.W.K. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently shown that treatment of HTLV1-infected T lymphocytes with proteasome inhibitors leads to the rapid accumulation of hyperphosphorylated IκBα (22McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A Scherer D.C.

However, the precise mechanism by which HTLV1 Tax interfaces with the host NF-κB signaling machinery to elicit a persistent pattern of nuclear NF-κB expression remained unclear. In the present report, we provide a unifying explanation for these prior experimental observations that links the constitutive activities of Tax, NF-κB, and IκB kinases known to mediate TNF-inducible phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (11Regnier C.H.

Four new lines of biochemical and genetic evidence indicate that these cytokine-responsive IKKs are primary cellular targets of HTLV1 Tax in the host NF-κB signaling pathway. First, IKK complexes containing either IKKα or IKKβ are constitutively activated in HTLV1-infected T-cells, but not in Tax-deficient Jurkat T-cells. Second, Tax is stably associated with these IKKs in HTLV1-infected cells. Third, overexpression of Tax in mammalian cells is sufficient to activate endogenous IKKs. Fourth, mutations in Tax that ablate its IKK-inducing function also prevent Tax-mediated activation of NF-κB. We conclude that newly synthesized IκBα in HTLV1-infected cells is rapidly phosphorylated at Ser-32 and Ser-36 by constitutively active IKKs, resulting in continuous IκBα turnover and persistent NF-κB expression (7Brockman J.A.

One clue to this mechanistic question is our finding that Tax associates with IKK complexes in HTLV1-infected T-cells. Moreover, mutations in Tax that disrupt its IKK-binding function also interfere with Tax-mediated activation of IKK, suggesting that the formation of Tax-IKK complexes is required for IKK activation. Accordingly, Tax might mimic a positive regulatory subunit that recruits an activated upstream signal transducer to the IKK complex. Two attractive candidates for this upstream signal transducer are the NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the related mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase MEKK1, both of which have been shown to activate NF-κB and IKK proteins when overexpressed in vivo (36Malinin N.L.

It has been suggested that malonyl-CoA plays a regulatory role by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation and promoting accumulation of cytosolic long-chain acyl-CoA (LC-CoA). In the current study, we have re-evaluated this “long-chain acyl-CoA hypothesis” by using molecular and pharmacologic methods to perturb lipid metabolism in INS-1 insulinoma cells or rat islets during glucose stimulation. First, we constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing the cDNA encoding malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (AdCMV-MCD), an enzyme that decarboxylates malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA. INS-1 cells treated with AdCMV-MCD had dramatically lowered intracellular malonyl CoA levels compared with AdCMV-βGal-treated cells at both 3 and 20 mm glucose. Further, at 20 mm glucose, AdCMV-MCD-treated cells were less effective at suppressing [1-14C]palmitate oxidation and incorporated 43% less labeled palmitate and 50% less labeled glucose into cellular lipids than either AdCMV-βGAL-treated or untreated INS-1 cells. Despite the large metabolic changes caused by expression of MCD, insulin secretion in response to glucose was unaltered relative to controls. The alternative, pharmacologic approach for perturbing lipid metabolism was to use triacsin C to inhibit long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase. This agent caused potent attenuation of palmitate oxidation and glucose or palmitate incorporation into cellular lipids and also caused a 47% decrease in total LC-CoA. Despite this, the drug had no effect on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in islets or INS-1 cells. We conclude that significant disruption of the link between glucose and lipid metabolism does not impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic islets or INS-1 cells.

We conclude that significant disruption of the link between glucose and lipid metabolism does not impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic islets or INS-1 cells. Glucose is a potent stimulator of insulin secretion from β-cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Regulation of insulin secretion by glucose is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by increases in the cellular ATP:ADP ratio, resulting in closure of ATP-sensitive K+ channels, membrane depolarization, and consequent activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (reviewed in Refs. 1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M.

In recent years the concept that glucose may also signal via altering lipid metabolism has received significant experimental support (3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Thus, glucose administration to HIT insulinoma cells results in an increase in malonyl-CoA levels that precede the rise in insulin secretion. The increase in malonyl-CoA, acting via its capacity to inhibit the mitochondrial enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (6McGarry J.D. Woeltje K.F. Kuwajima M. Foster D.W. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1989; 5: 271-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), results in inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, increased de novo lipid synthesis, and a rise in diacylglycerol content. These findings led Prentki and colleagues (3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol.

While the proposed mechanisms are reasonable, direct evidence for any of these actions of lipids on insulin secretion has not been provided to date.Other recent studies have demonstrated that the effects of lipids on β-cell function are complex. Lowering of circulating fatty acids via administration of nicotinic acid (7Stein D.T. Esser V. Stevenson B.E. Lane K.E. Whiteside J.H. Daniels M.B. Chen S. McGarry J.D. J. Clin.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) completely abrogates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, but full secretory function can be restored by provision of fatty acids to the pancreas of such animals. It has also been established for some time that fatty acids are acute potentiators of the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion response (10Tamarit-Rodriguez J. Vara E. Tamarit J. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 11Bedoya F.J. Ramirez R. Arilla E. Goberna R. Diabetes. 1984; 33: 858-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In contrast to these positive acute effects of lipids on islet function, long-term exposure to hyperlipidemic conditions results in a condition of “lipotoxicity,” wherein lipid overstorage leads to the syndrome of β-cell dysfunction associated with insulin-resistant and diabetic states, including β-cell hyperplasia, basal hyperinsulinemia, and loss of glucose responsiveness (12Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1995; 44: 863-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zhou Y-P. Grill V.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1995; 80: 1584-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In light of the growing emphasis on the role of lipids in β-cell function, the current study was undertaken to re-investigate the LC-CoA hypothesis of β-cell signal transduction using novel molecular and pharmacologic approaches. The goal of the study was to manipulate the levels of malonyl-CoA and LC-CoA esters during glucose stimulation and to assess the effect of such maneuvers on insulin secretion. The molecular approach chosen was to use recombinant adenovirus to express the enzyme malonyl-CoA decarboxylase, which decarboxylates malonyl-CoA to acetyl-CoA, thus allowing us to specifically block malonyl-CoA accumulation during glucose stimulation. The pharmacologic approach was to use triacsin C, an inhibitor of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (14Tomoda H. Igarashi K. Omura S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) to block the conversion of fatty acids to LC-CoA. We demonstrate that while both approaches have a large impact on lipid metabolism in the β-cell, neither maneuver influences glycolytic flux or glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.DISCUSSIONIn this study we have applied molecular (MCD expression) and pharmacologic (triacsin C treatment) strategies for attenuating glucose-induced alterations in lipid metabolism in insulin-secreting cells. Suprisingly, neither approach impaired glycolysis or affected glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in INS-1 cells, and the lack of impact of triacsin C on regulation of insulin secretion was also confirmed in freshly isolated rat islets. These results suggest that reassessment of the long-chain acyl-CoA hypothesis for stimulus secretion coupling in islet β-cells is in order. Two important observations that led to development of the hypothesis were: 1) increasing glycolytic flux in β-cells by increasing the extracellular glucose concentration led to an increase in malonyl-CoA levels proportional to insulin secretion (3Corkey B.E.

Deeney J. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and 2) glucose-mediated alterations in malonyl-CoA levels were linked to changes in lipid metabolism and the cytosolic LC-CoA pool, which in turn was suggested to trigger insulin secretion by an undefined mechanism (3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M. Regazzi R.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In what follows, these two critical observations are re-evaluated in the context of the data obtained in the current study.First, increasing glycolytic flux in β-cells by increasing the extracellular glucose concentration leads to an increase in malonyl-CoA levels that is proportional to insulin secretion. Our findings are in agreement with this cornerstone observation of the LC-CoA hypothesis, but only in control INS-1 cells. We find that malonyl-CoA levels are increased in response to a change in glucose concentration from 3 to 20 mm at both 5 and 30 min in control INS-1 cells, the same range over which glucose stimulated-insulin secretion. However, expression of MCD in INS-1 cells sharply attenuates the rise in malonyl-CoA levels in response to stimulatory glucose at the 5-min time point. At 30 min, MCD expression lowers basal malonyl-CoA levels substantially, but allows an increase in the intermediate in response to glucose. However, at both 5 and 30 min, the levels of malonyl-CoA achieved in MCD expressing cells exposed to 20 mm glucose are well below the levels in control cells incubated at 20 mm glucose and are in fact not statistically different than the levels in control cells incubated at 3 mm glucose. These data indicate that the high levels of malonyl-CoA achieved in glucose-stimulated control INS-1 cells do not define a critical threshold of the intermediate that must be achieved in order for insulin secretion to be activated. However, we cannot as yet formally exclude the unlikely possibility that the increment in malonyl-CoA that remains in MCD expressing cells at the 30-min time point is involved in stimulus/secretion coupling.Second, glucose-mediated alterations in malonyl-CoA levels are linked to changes in lipid metabolism and an increase in the cytosolic LC-CoA pool that regulate insulin secretion. Again, we were able to confirm the correlative linkage between lipid metabolism and insulin secretion (3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M. Regazzi R. Deeney J. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but only in INS-1 cells not engineered for MCD expression or treated with triacsin C. In such control cells, raising glucose from 3 to 20 mm results in a profound inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, with concomitant and potent activation of incorporation of radiolabeled glucose and palmitate into organically extractable cellular lipids. It is assumed that the increased incorporation of glucose or palmitate into lipids reflects accumulation of cytosolic LC-CoA, the necessary intermediate for synthesis of end products such as phospholipids and triglycerides. Interestingly, previous measurements of LC-CoA during glucose stimulation of a hamster insulinoma cell line (HIT) showed a decrease in the total LC-CoA pool (3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was suggested that the total LC-CoA pool largely represents material sequestered in the mitochondria, and is an inaccurate measure of changes in the more relevant cytoplasmic pool (3Corkey B.E. Glennon M.C. Chen K.S. Deeney J.T. Matschinsky F.M. Prentki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21608-21612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This represents a technical limitation for evaluating the relationship between cytoplasmic LC-CoA and insulin secretion. However, in the current study, we have utilized triacsin C as a direct inhibitor of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase, the enzyme responsible for LC-CoA synthesis. We find that this reagent has its anticipated effects of sharply suppressing fatty acid oxidation and esterification in both INS-1 cells and freshly isolated rat islets, but does not influence glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Importantly, triacsin C also causes a 45% decrease in total LC-CoA levels in INS-1 cells incubated at either low or high glucose concentrations. Similarly, expression of MCD in INS-1 cells significantly attenuates glucose-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation while decreasing glucose and palmitate incorporation into cellular lipids with no effect on regulation of insulin secretion. Because these two completely independent methods produced similar results, we conclude that there is no direct correlation between the extent to which lipids are directed toward oxidative or esterification pathways and insulin secretion. While we have not directly measured the cytosolic LC-CoA pool, to the extent that the fall in total LC-CoA in response to triacsin C is reflective of this fraction, our data also argue that a rise in LC-CoA is not a critical event in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This conclusion is also applicable to other carbohydrate secretagogues, since we have recently shown that blockade of glycerol incorporation into cellular lipids with triacsin C in glycerol kinase-expressing INS-1 cells has no effect on glycerol-stimulated insulin secretion (16Noel R.J. Antinozzi P.A. McGarry J.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18621-18627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Note that in a recent study in fibroblasts, triacsin C was shown to be almost completely effective in blocking triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis from glycerol, while incorporation of oleate or arachidonate into phospholipids was less impaired (26Igal R.A. Wang P. Coleman R.A. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 529-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Similarly, using thin layer chromatography analysis of INS-1 cell extracts, we have observed that triacsin C inhibits conversion of [1-14C]palmitate into triglycerides by more than 90%, while incorporation of the same substrate into phospholipids is reduced by 50% (data not shown). Thus, while the effects of MCD expression or triacsin C treatment on lipid fluxes in our studies were large, they were not complete, and it remains possible that a small residual flux of substrate into specific esterification or biosynthetic pathways is required for maintenance of glucose responsiveness. It could be envisaged, for example, that a lesser efficiency of triacsin C for blockade of phospholipid biosynthesis could allow maintenance of a critical pool of this substrate for phospholipase A2-mediated hydrolysis and release of potential second messengers such as arachadonic acid (27Turk J. Wolf B.A. McDaniel M.L. Prog. Lipid Res. 1987; 26: 125-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our results are not simply reconciled with earlier experiments in which a presumed block of malonyl-CoA synthesis with the citrate lyase inhibitor, hydroxycitrate, in the perfused rat pancreas was found to inhibit glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, an effect that was reversible by palmitate addition (5Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that studies by other investigators failed to demonstrate an effect of hydroxycitrate on isolated rat islets (28Sener A. Malaisse W.J. Biochimie. 1991; 73: 1287-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and in confirmation of this finding, no effect of the drug on insulin secretion was observed in fresh rat islets or INS-1 cells by us (data not shown). Also, addition of the β-oxidation inhibitor, etomoxir, to the perfused pancreas preparation potentiates insulin secretion, but only at concentrations 10 times higher than required to inhibit oxidation, suggesting that the effect of this reagent on insulin secretion may be via its structural similarity to saturated fatty acids, which are known potentiators of insulin release (5Chen S. Ogawa A. Ohneda M. Unger R.H. Foster D.W. McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). We can only speculate that the intact pancreas has a unique susceptibility to hydroxycitrate compared with isolated islets or INS-1 cells, or that this reagent has effects at sites other than inhibition of citrate lyase in the perfused pancreas preparation. Perhaps culturing isolated islets or cell lines in rich media containing essential lipids from the fetal calf serum is sufficient to overcome hydroxycitrate-mediated inhibition of lipogenesis. Additionally, isolated islets and β-cell lines may have a greater storage capacity for lipids than the intact pancreas, which would make the pancreas more susceptible to lipogenic inhibitors. Thus, while we feel that our major conclusion that large alterations in lipid metabolism are not linked to perturbations in glucose-regulated insulin secretion is correct for freshly isolated rat islets and INS-1 cells, it remains possible that islets in situ are sensitive to regulation by such a mechanism.It has, in fact, recently been shown that complete depletion of lipid stores in islets blocks normal responsiveness to glucose and other secretagogues. Thus, animals treated with nicotinic acid to lower circulating free fatty acid exhibit no increase in insulin secretion in response to a glucose challenge (7Stein D.T. Esser V. Stevenson B.E.

Daniels M.B. Turley S.D. McGarry J.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 398-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Similarly, islets in the perfused pancreas of animals rendered hyperleptinemic for a period of 1 week are completely devoid of triglyceride and fail to respond to glucose or arginine as a secretagogue, while animals pair-fed to the lower rate of food intake of hyperleptinemic animals retain normal islet function and some residual triglyceride (9Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Lee Y. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Insulin secretion in response to glucose can be rapidly restored by lipid infusion into nicotinic acid-treated animals (7Stein D.T. Esser V. Stevenson B.E. Lane K.E. Whiteside J.H. Daniels M.B.

These data argue that lipids must be present, at least at some minimal level, in order for islet β-cells to function normally.In light of all of these results, we suggest the following modification of the long-chain acyl-CoA hypothesis. Our work shows that large impairment in the normal link between glucose and lipid metabolism in β-cells is tolerated with no impact on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, as long as glycolytic flux is not perturbed. This allows us to narrow the search for metabolic pathways and coupling factors involved in acute glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. With the apparent elimination of changes in malonyl-CoA levels and attendant alterations in lipid metabolism, the most likely candidates now include a glycolytic signal, oxidative events, or anaplerosis (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar,2Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev.

The primary signal may include the well recognized glucose-driven increase in ATP:ADP ratio, leading to inhibition of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and influx of extracellular Ca2+ (1Meglasson M.D. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1986; 2: 163-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 2Newgard C.B. McGarry J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 689-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar).Our experiments were designed to evaluate the effect of acute perturbation of the link between glucose and lipid metabolism. The abrogation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion by more long term maneuvers such as nicotinic acid administration or adenovirus-induced hyperleptinemia (7Stein D.T. Esser V. Stevenson B.E.

Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) may be explained by lipid depletion and the resultant absence of essential modulators of secretory granule trafficking and/or exocytosis. Examples of distal sites at which lipids may be acting include generation of signaling molecules such as diacylglycerol or inositol trisphosphate, or via contribution to secretory granule or plasma membrane turnover (3Corkey B.E.

Diabetes. 1994; 43: 878-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). That lipids are acting at a distal rather than a proximal site is supported by the finding that lipid-depleted islets not only fail to respond to glucose but also show no response to arginine, leucine, or the sulfonylurea, glibenclamide (9Koyama K. Chen G. Wang M-Y. Lee Y. Shimabukuro M. Newgard C.B. Unger R.H. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30Dobbins R.L. Chester M.W. Stevenson B.E. Daniels M.B. Stein D.T. McGarry J.D. J. Clin. Invest.,. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Arginine is thought to exert its secretory effects by directly affecting membrane polarization, while sulfonylureas are believed to bring about the same effect by inhibiting ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity. Thus, both agents act distal to any anticipated early metabolic signal. Yet with all secretagogues tested to date, the attenuated insulin response in lipid-depleted islets is restored to normal by inclusion of fatty acids in the perfusate (7Stein D.T. Esser V.

Invest.,. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). The mechanism by which fatty acids exert these important modulatory effects on insulin secretion remain to be established.Finally, it should be emphasized that the data do not discount the possibility that the malonyl-CoA/carnitine palmitoyltransferase I metabolic signaling network may play important roles in long-term processes related to insulin secretion, i.e. β-cell growth, apoptosis, regulation of important metabolic genes, and effects related to chronic exposure of β-cells to high concentrations of fatty acids (i.e. changes in glucose sensitivity, “lipotoxicity”) (2Newgard C.B.

The molecular and pharmacologic tools described in this paper should be useful for future investigation of these issues.Note Added in ProofAfter submission of this paper we became aware of an article by Zhang and Kim in which stable expression of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) antisense RNA in INS-1 cells was reported (33Zhang S. Kim K.-H. Cell Signal. 1998; 10: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the ACC antisense construct, a 40% reduction in ACC enzymatic activity correlated with a similar decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and malonyl CoA levels and an approximate doubling of the rate of fatty acid oxidation. One potential explanation for these findings is that stable suppression of ACC activity, as opposed to transient expression of MCD or short term treatment with triacsin C, may lead to a depletion of the cellular lipid stores, similar to what is observed in animals treated with nicotinic acid or infused with an adenovirus containing the leptin cDNA (7Stein D.T.

The localization of two cytoplasmic Cys residues was confirmed by using 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid to block fluorescein-5′-maleimide labeling. From the localization of the Cys residues, a model for the topography is proposed that consists of five transmembrane segments with the NH2 terminus periplasmic and the COOH terminus cytoplasmic.

H+-transporting F1F0 ATP synthases consist of two structurally and functionally distinct sectors termed F1 and F0 (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 68: 177-231Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The F1 sector lies at the surface of the membrane and in Escherichia coliconsists of five subunits in aα 3 β 3 γ 1 δ 1 ε 1stoichiometry. The F0 sector spans the membrane and inE. coli consists of three subunits in an a1b2c10 + 1 stoichiometry (2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). In the intact enzyme, ATP synthesis or hydrolysis takes place in the F1 sector and is coupled to active H+ transport through the F0 sector. Structurally similar F0F1 ATP synthases are present in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and most other eubacteria (1Senior A.E. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 68: 177-231Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The structure of theα 3 β 3 γ 1part of the bovine mitochondrial F1 sector has been solved by x-ray crystallography (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2715) Google Scholar). Structures of major parts of the isolatedδ and ε subunits of the E. colienzyme have been solved by NMR (4Wilkens S. Dunn S.D.

Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In contrast to the F1 sector, there is very little structural information available on the F0 sector. The structure of portions of monomeric subunit c in an organic solvent mixture has been solved by NMR (6Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H.

In the solvent system used, subunit c folds as a hairpin of two α-helices. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that the structure determined by NMR mimics the structure of the subunit in the membrane (8Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subunit c contains an Asp residue in the middle of the second transmembrane helix, which functions as the key H+ binding site in the proton conduction pathway through F0 (8Fillingame R.H. J. Exp.

Subunit b consists of an NH2-terminal transmembrane helix and a largely α-helical cytoplasmic domain that is responsible for binding F1 (9Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev.

Subunit a is a very hydrophobic 30-kDa protein of 271 residues that is thought to span the membrane multiple times (2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar). It is thought to function with subunit c in ATPase-coupled proton translocation (11Hatch P.L. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M. J. Biol.

A number of topographical models, consisting of 4–7 transmembrane helices have been proposed based on hydropathy plots (2Fillingame R.H. Kurlwich T.A. The Bacteria. 12. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar), although topographical models consisting of five or six transmembrane helices are now commonly favored (11Hatch P.L. Cox G.B. Howitt S.M.

Studies on the topography of the subunit using proteases, gene fusions, or sequence-specific antibodies have yielded contradictory results (14Hoppe J. Friedl P. Schairer H.U.

Genetic introduction of Cys and chemical labeling has been used to obtain topographical information on several membrane proteins,e.g. MotA (19Zhou J. Fazzio R.T. Blair D.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), P-glycoprotein (20Loo T. Clark D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), and Tn10-TetA transport protein (21Kimura T. Ohnuma M. Sawai T. Yamaguchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 580-585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and we have applied that strategy here to subunit a. In this approach, Cys residues are introduced at a number of sites predicted to fall in loops outside the membrane and accessibility of these Cys to sulfydryl-directed reagents determined with membrane vesicles of opposite sidedness. From the extent of labeling in differently oriented vesicles, the cellular localization of the Cys residues can be inferred. Sufficient Cys residues have been topographically localized in subunit a by this approach to provide a topographical model. Second site suppressors can provide hints about the interacting parts of a protein and, for a membrane protein, suggest possible topographical models. It has previously been demonstrated that the Glu219 and His245 residues of subunit a are not essential for function (12Valiyaveetil F. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32313-32317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are, however, narrow limits on the residues that can be substituted at either position with retention of function. We show here that Cys is not tolerated at either of these positions. Second site suppressors to the nonfunctional E219C and H245C mutations have been isolated. The positions of these second site suppressors and of other suppressor pairs previously described in the literature are easily interpreted by the topographical model derived from Cys reactivity. For the introduction of a His6 tag following residue 269 in subunit a, a BglII site was initially introduced at the COOH terminus of the uncB gene (which encodes subunit a). An oligonucleotide, GGTAAATTAAAGATCTTCAGACG, was synthesized, which corresponds to nucleotides 1823–1845 1The unc DNA numbering system corresponds to that used by Walker et al. (23Walker J.E.

The mutations were incorporated into a PCR 2The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; ISO, stripped inside out membrane vesicles; RSO, right side out membrane vesicles; FM, fluorescein 5-maleimide; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid, disodium salt; TCEP, Tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. fragment using the megaprimer method (24Barik S. Trower M.K. Methods in Molecular Biology. 57. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ1996: 203-215Google Scholar). The megaprimer method involves the use of a mutant primer and two wild type primers. Primers TGCTGCCGTACATTGCT and CACAGCACAATGCCTCT, which initiate DNA synthesis at nucleotides 1397 and 2189, respectively, were used as the wild type primers. The DNA fragment obtained from the PCR protocol was cloned between the PstI(1565) and AvaI(1976) sites in plasmid pCP1200, resulting in plasmid pVF172. Plasmid pCP1200 contains the HindIII(870) to AvaI(1976) fragment ofunc DNA cloned between these sites in plasmid pBR322 (25Paule C.R. Fillingame R.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 270-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The presence of the BglII site in the plasmid pVF172 was confirmed by restriction digests and DNA sequencing. The His6 tag at the COOH terminus was introduced by digesting plasmid pVF172 with BglII and ligating with the following synthetic DNA fragment. GATCATCATCATCATCATCATTAATAGTAGTAGTAGTAGTAATTCTAGSEQUENCE 1 This resulted in plasmid pVF196. The presence of the Asp-His6 tag and stop codon following the Glu269 codon was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cys substitutions were introduced by the megaprimer method using a synthetic oligonucleotide, which contained the desired codon change, and two wild type primers. The DNA fragment resulting from the megaprimer mutagenesis protocol was cloned into the plasmid pVF196 using appropriate restriction sites. For example, the E131C mutation was constructed using the oligonucleotide GCCGTACATTGCTTGCCATGTACTGGGTCT, which corresponds to nucleotides 1401–1430 of the wild type uncB gene except that the E131 codon is substituted by TGC (underlined), which encodes Cys. Primers TTCTTCTCGGTGGTGCT and CTGGTTTGGACAGCAGG, which initiate DNA synthesis at nucleotides 1162 and 1636, respectively, were used as the wild type primers. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned between the NcoI(1305) and PstI(1565) sites in plasmid pVF196. The S202C, N214C, and I223C mutations were provided by Dr. W. Jiang (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI) on a pDF163-like plasmid (26Fraga D. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pDF163 contains the HindIII(870) toSphI(3216) fragment of unc DNA cloned between these sites in plasmid pBR322. The mutations were transferred to a pVF196-like plasmid by subcloning the BamHI fragment from the corresponding pDF163 derivative into the BamHI sites in pVF196. The presence of the Cys substitution in the resulting plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cells were grown in M63 minimal medium containing 0.6% glucose supplemented with 2 mg/liter thiamine, 0.2 mm uracil, 0.2 mml-arginine, 0.02 mm dihydrobenzoic acid supplemented with 10% LB medium (27Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Ampicillin, when needed, was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Cells were grown to late logarithmic phase and harvested for preparation of inside out (ISO) and right side out (RSO) membrane vesicles. ISO membrane vesicles were prepared in TMDG buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) by rupture of cells using a French press (28Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ISO membrane vesicles used for the labeling experiments were stripped of F1 by incubation in TDEG buffer (1 mmTris-H2SO4, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) for 30 min at 30 °C and then collected by centrifugation (28Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). RSO membrane vesicles were prepared using a modification of the protocol of Kaback (29Kaback H.R. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 22: 99-120Crossref Scopus (552) Google Scholar). All of the centrifugation steps were performed at 4 °C. The centrifugal forces stated are the maximum for a given rotor. Briefly, cells were suspended in 0.03 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 30% sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and converted into spheroplasts by treatment with 20 μg/ml of lysozyme for 45 min at room temperature (22–24 °C). Spheroplasts were collected by centrifugation at 18,000 × g. The spheroplasts were suspended in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 30% sucrose, 25 mg/ml DNase I, 10 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then lysed by a 1:100 dilution into 8 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. After a 15-min incubation at 22–24 °C, EDTA was added to 10 mm, and after a further 15-min incubation, MgSO4 was added to 15 mm. The mixture was incubated for another 15 min, and the vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 18,000 ×g. Cell debris and unlysed spheroplasts present were removed by low speed centrifugation at 4000 × g. The right side out vesicles were finally harvested by centrifugation at 75,000 × g for 30 min. The vesicles were suspended in TMDG buffer and stored at −80 °C until use. RSO and ISO membrane vesicles were collected by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in one of two incubation buffers at a protein concentration of 15 mg/ml for RSO membrane vesicles and 10 mg/ml for ISO membrane vesicles. Approximately 1–2 mg of membrane protein was used for the labeling reaction. FM (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was added from a stock solution prepared in dimethyl formamide and membranes were incubated at 30 °C. The volume of dimethyl formamide added never exceeded 1% of the reaction volume. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 m N-ethylmaleimide in ethanol to a final concentration of 30 mm. The membrane vesicles were solublized by the addition of SDS to a final concentration of 1%. The solution was diluted to approximately 1 mg/ml protein using His6 binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS). 40 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) were added, and the suspension was incubated with gentle shaking for 1 h at 22–24 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl, 1% SDS. Proteins bound to the beads were eluted by boiling for 3 min at 100 °C in elution buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.75, 20 mm EDTA, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue). The eluted proteins were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide gel using the Tris-Tricine buffer system described by Schagger and von Jagow (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the unstained gel was photographed on a 300-nm transilluminator using a number 12 yellow filter (Tiffen, Hauppauge, NY) and Polaroid 665 film (F4.5, 2 min). The positive was developed by the manufacturer's instructions and scanned using a flat bed scanner linked to a Macintosh computer using OFOTO software (Lightsource Computer Images Inc.). The scan was quantitated using the public domain NIH Image program. 3Developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the World Wide Web athttp://rsb.info.gov/nih-image. To determine the amount of subunit a present, the gel was stained using Coomassie Blue R-250 (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.55Google Scholar). The gel was dried, scanned, and quantitated as described above to obtain the amount of protein present. For isolation of revertants, the uncB deletion strain, VF245 (pyrE41, entA403, argH1, rpsL109, supE44, ΔuncB, recA56, srl::Tn10) (12Valiyaveetil F. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) was transformed with plasmids pVF156 and pVF158, which contain the E219C and H245C mutations, respectively, in the plasmid pDF163 (26Fraga D. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6797-6803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of the transformants grown in LB medium were plated on succinate minimal agar plates and incubated at 37 °C. Revertant colonies were observed after incubation for 3–5 days. The revertants were purified by streaking for single colonies on succinate minimal medium plates. Protein concentration was determined using a modified Lowry protocol (28Fillingame R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 870-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ATP-driven quenching experiments were performed with HMK buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.3 m KCl) using ACMA at a final concentration of 0.3 μg/ml (12Valiyaveetil F. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32635-32641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For easy purification of subunit a, a His6 tag was introduced at the COOH terminus. The uncB deletion strain, VF245, was transformed with either plasmid pVF196 (UncB(His) 6) or the UncB+control plasmid, pCP1200. The ability of the transformants to grow on succinate minimal plates was tested. A functional F0F1 ATP synthase is required for growth on succinate. The strain VF245/pVF196 was able to form colonies on succinate minimal medium plates, which were similar in size to colonies formed by VF245/pCP1200, indicating the presence of a functional ATP synthase. Further, membranes prepared from VF245/pVF196 and the wild type control strain (VF245/pCP1200) showed identical levels of ATP-driven quenching of ACMA fluorescence. The membranes also had similar ATPase activities and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide sensitivities. These experiments indicate that the His6 tag at the COOH terminus of subunit a has no effect on function of the enzyme, and therefore the His6 tag does not cause a significant perturbation of the structure of the subunit. A number of Cys residues were introduced into His6-tagged subunit a by PCR mutagenesis. The ΔuncB strain, VF245, was transformed with pCP1200-like plasmids containing the various Cys substitutions. For all Cys substitutions, the VF245 transformants grew on succinate, indicating minimal structural perturbation. The E196C, S202C, and M266C mutants did form single colonies that were slightly smaller than for wild type after 3 days of growth (i.e. 1.0, 1.5, and 1.5 mm, respectively, versus 2.0 mm for wild type). FM was used as the labeling reagent due to its high fluorescence extinction, which allowed detection of labeling of small amounts of protein. The localization of the Cys introduced into the subunit was determined by the difference in the extent of labeling by FM in ISO and RSO membrane vesicles. ISO vesicles were routinely stripped of F1 to enhance exposure of potential extramembranous Cys on the cytoplasmic face of the membrane. However, in no case did we find a reactive cytoplasmic Cys that was protected by F1 binding. In the final experimental protocol settled on here, the extent of labeling is described as the percentage of fluorescence intensity of a membrane sample labeled in the absence of SDS relative to the fluorescence intensity of the membrane sample labeled in the presence of 1% SDS. The fluorescence intensity was determined by scanning the photograph of the fluorescent gel. The fluorescence intensity of each membrane sample was standardized to the amount of protein present on the gel, which was determined by Coomassie staining, since the yield of His6-tagged protein recovered varied by approximately 20% from sample to sample. The increase in fluorescence intensity was nearly linear with the amount of protein applied to the gel over the fluorescence range used in the experiments below (Fig. 1). A shift in the mobility of the protein bands on SDS gels after labeling of Cys residues with FM or AMS has been reported previously for two proteins with molecular mass of 16 and 33 kDa, respectively (32Jones P.C. Harrison M.A. Kim Y. Finbow M.E. Findlay J.B.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 33Krishnasastry M. Walker B. Braha O. Bayley H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 66-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the case of subunit a, the shift in mobility was position-dependent and, of the mutants tested, was observed for the S3C-, S27C-, V71C-, and E131C-substituted proteins. The mobility shift observed with the E131C mutant protein upon labeling by FM is shown in Fig. 2. The shift was used to determine the fraction of the total subunit a that was modified by FM. In the presence of SDS, all of the subunit a present was labeled, as indicated by the complete shift in mobility of the subunit a band. The fraction of the subunit that was labeled in intact membrane vesicles was determined from the amount of protein present in the shifted versus the unshifted band. The fraction of the subunit in the shifted band (55% in Fig. 2) was very similar to the value obtained on comparing the standardized fluorescence intensity of the sample relative to the SDS control (59% in this experiment). 4As shown in Fig. 2, nearly all of the E131C subunit a in RSO vesicles was labeled by FM in the presence of SDS, and maximal labeling was seen in ISO vesicles as well (data not shown). When the normalized fluorescence intensities of other SDS controls were compared, no significant differences in the maximal labeling intensity were seen for ISO and RSO vesicles for all other mutants with the exception of S3C (see “S3C” under “Results”). Examples of other SDS controls are given in Fig. 5. For most residues, the labeling reaction was carried out with 1 mm FM for 5 min in TP buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.8, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The high pH of the TP buffer helped to reduce the membrane permeability of FM by promoting ionization of the carboxyl group in the molecule. For residues that showed low reactivity to FM, e.g. E196C, reactions with 1 mm FM were carried out in TNP buffer (0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 60 min to maximize the extent of reaction. Under both of the conditions used, labeling was specific to Cys, since no labeling was observed in wild type subunit a, which lacks Cys. The labeling characteristics of the various Cys residues are considered below. Cys residues introduced at both of these positions were highly reactive and easily labeled by 1 mmFM in both ISO and RSO membrane vesicles (TableI and Fig. 3). Greater than 90% labeling was observed in ISO vesicles relative to the SDS control, but RSO vesicles showed labeling approaching 60–70% of the SDS-treated control. An experiment was therefore carried out using a lower concentration of FM. Upon labeling using 0.1 mm FM, labeling was seen only in the case of ISO membrane vesicles for both of these mutants (Fig. 3). This indicated that both positions 71 and 266 were cytoplasmic. The localization of these positions was further confirmed by a protection experiment. In the protection experiment, vesicles were preincubated with a low concentration of a more polar maleimide, i.e. 150 μm AMS, before incubation with 1 mm FM. For both V71C and M266C, labeling by FM was inhibited by AMS in only ISO membrane vesicles (Fig. 4). This second approach confirmed the cytoplasmic location of positions 71 and 266.Table IExtent of labeling of cysteine residues introduced in subunit αSubstitutionRight side out vesiclesaValues reported are the extent of labeling ± S.D. calculated relative to the labeling occurring in the presence of SDS as described.

The F1F0 ATP synthase fromEscherichia coli is typical of the ATP synthases found in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many other bacteria (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

It comprises an F1 complex, which contains the nucleotide-binding subunits involved in catalysis, and an F0 complex, which conducts protons across the membrane. The enzyme from E. coli appears to be a minimal form of the ATP synthase, with eight essential subunits. Five different subunits are found in F1: α, β, γ, δ, and ε, in a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1. Three different subunits, named a, b, and c form F0 with a likely stoichiometry of 1:2:9–12 (5Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2009-2015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane drives ATP synthesis is slowly emerging (6Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), due in large part to success in recent years in obtaining structural information about the subunits of the enzyme. The crystallization of F1 from bovine mitochondria (7Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar) led to a high resolution structure of the α3β3 hexamer, plus parts of γ in the central core. Electron cryomicroscopic images have also contributed to an understanding of subunit arrangement (8Gogol E.P. Lucken U. Bork T. Capaldi R.A.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,30Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Lack of information about the tertiary and quaternary structure of F0 subunits has limited progress in understanding how F0 translocates protons and how it might drive rotation of γ and ε subunits in F1. The b subunits seem to be embedded in the membrane via a span of hydrophobic amino acids at the NH2 terminus. A truncated, soluble form of subunit b has been shown to be extended and dimeric (31Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7630-7636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies of subunit c have confirmed the α-helical hairpin structure of the two predicted transmembrane spans (29Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12167-12177Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H.

Questions remain about the oligomeric structure of subunit c and how it interacts with subunits a and b. Mutagenesis has revealed that in addition to Asp61 of subunit c, three residues in subunit a seem to be important in proton translocation: Arg210, Glu219, and His245 (34Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10043-10050Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Cain B.D.

Acta. 1988; 933: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Knowledge of the relative location of these four residues could provide much insight into proton translocation and subunit movements. Subunit a is an extremely hydrophobic protein of 271 amino acids. It cannot be expressed at high levels in E. coli (39von Meyenburg K. Jorgensen B.B. Michelsen O. Sorensen L. McCarthy J.E. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2357-2363Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and has only been purified in the presence of trichloroacetate (40Schneider E. Altendorf K. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) according to von Heijne (42von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar) indicates five “certain” transmembrane spans and one “tentative” span. Because the important residues in subunit a reside in the last two predicted transmembrane spans, and the uncertain span immediately precedes this region, at least two plausible arrangements exist. Such questions of membrane topology can be addressed by gene fusion experiments (43Traxler B. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the case of subunit a, two groups (44Bjørbæk C. Foërsom V. Michelsen O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have used phoA fusions to determine its membrane topology but failed to reach agreement. A more recent study used peptide-directed antibodies against polar regions of subunit a to determine membrane topology (46Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but only three of the antibodies provided information. To address the issues of how many transmembrane spans are in subunit a and how they are oriented, we have generated a collection of subunit a mutants, each with a single unique cysteine residue. These mutants can be probed with sulfhydryl reagents in oriented membrane preparations to determine the surface accessibility of different residues. Restriction endonucleases and T4 DNA ligase were obtained from New England Biolabs. Materials for silver sequencing and plasmid minipreps were obtained from Promega Corp. Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Operon Technologies or National Biosciences. Urea was from International Biotechnologies, Inc. MPB 1The abbreviations used are: MPB, 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl) biocytin; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid; octyl glucoside, n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside; HA, the hemagglutinin HA2 epitope (YPYDVPDYA). and AMS were obtained from Molecular Probes. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin was obtained from Qiagen. Octyl glucoside was obtained from Sigma. Anti-a antibodies were provided by Dr. Karlheinz Altendorf (Osnabrück). Immunoblotting reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad. Plasmids used for mutagenesis and expression are shown in Fig. 1. Plasmids designated “His” code for 5 additional histidine residues following the natural carboxyl-terminal His271 of subunit a. Silent mutations have been introduced into various regions of uncBto facilitate cassette mutagenesis. While this project was under way, it was discovered that several plasmids had very poor expression: pSBV16 and its derivatives (47Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is thought that this was due to the loss of the tet promoter originally found in pACYC184. Therefore, many of the mutations were subcloned into new plasmids that contained the promoter. Plasmid pSW18His was constructed from pSBV18 (47Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the oligonucleotides that also introduced Cys277(see Fig. 2). Plasmid pSW19His was constructed from the 1575-bp BsaHI–EcoRI fragment of pSW18His, containing most of uncB, and the 1633-bp BsaHI–EcoRI fragment of pBJA1018 (48Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 16229-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid pLN6His was constructed in the following way: pLN4 was constructed from pSBV4 (49Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by replacing the 222-bpBglI–DraIII region in uncB with synthetic DNA, including new restriction sites BglII andBstEII. pLN6His was then constructed from the 815-bpPvuI–EcoRI fragment of pSW18His, containing the oligohistidine coding region, and the 2475-bpPvuI–EcoRI fragment of pLN4, containing most ofuncB. Plasmid pLN46His was constructed from pLN6His using the DraIII–PstI synthetic cassette, as for pBJA46 (48Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 16229-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmid pTW1HisHA was constructed in the following way: pLN6HisHA was constructed from pLN6His by inserting the HA-oligonucleotides (Fig. 2) in the SapI site ofuncB, near the carboxyl-terminal coding region. pTW1HisHA was constructed from the 760-bp BsaHI--PvuI fragment of pSBV18, containing most of uncB, and the 2560-bpBsaHI--PvuI fragment of pLN6HisHA.Figure 2Oligonucleotides used to construct mutations. The site of the mutation is shown at theleft. The restriction sites used in the cassette mutagenesis are also indicated. In some cases, an equal mixture of two bases was used at a single site to generate multiple mutations (M, A plus C; K, G plus T, W, A plus T; Y, C plus T; R, A plus G; S, G plus C). The oligohistidine construct was originally made with 50% two stop codons, and 50% cysteine preceding a single stop codon. The HA was inserted at a SapI site in pLN6His that precedes the His6. Along with the oligohistidine, it generates a sequence following Ser268 of YPYDVPDYASEEHHHHHH.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Mutations were introduced into uncBusing the oligonucleotides shown in Fig. 2. The mutation at position 69 was made by Dr. Brian Cain (University of Florida), using M13 phage and provided to us as replicative form DNA. The others were constructed by cassette mutagenesis, using the indicated restriction sites. Mutations 24 and 27 were originally constructed in pSW18His and were transferred to pSW19His using BsaHI and EcoRI, as described above. Mutation 8 was constructed in pSW19His. Mutation 131 was constructed in pLN6His. Mutations 169, 172, and 176 were constructed in pLN46His. Mutations 196 and 238 were constructed in pTW1HisHA, and mutations 89 and 128 were constructed in pLN6HisHA. These two plasmids produce a subunit a that is 15 amino acids longer than wild type. For expression, RH305 (uncB205, recA56, srl::Tn10,bglR, thi-1, rel-1, Hfr PO1) was used as the background strain (50Humbert R. Brusilow W.S.A. Gunsalus R.P. Klionsky D.J. Simoni R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 416-422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It produces an a subunit that is truncated near Pro240 (51Hartzog P.E. Cain B.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1337-1343Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is complemented by plasmids containing a wild type uncB gene. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in LB or in minimal A medium supplemented with succinate (0.2%) (52Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431-435Google Scholar). Media were also supplemented with chloramphenicol (34 mg/liter) or tetracycline (12.5 mg/liter) as appropriate. Inside out membrane vesicles were made from a 250-ml culture in LB medium grown toA 600 = 1.0. Cells were resuspended in 5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 10 mm MgSO4(pH 8.0) and passed through the French press at 14,000 p.s.i. After a low speed spin to remove unbroken cells (7000 × g), the supernatant was centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman Ti-70 rotor. To prepare stripped membrane vesicles (loss of F1), the vesicles were resuspended in stripping buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 EDTA, and 10% glycerol) and agitated at 4 °C overnight. The next day, the centrifugation was repeated, and the vesicles were resuspended in 200 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0). For nonstripped vesicles, the samples were resuspended directly in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The membrane vesicles were labeled in 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), with MPB. The reaction was stopped by adding β-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 20 mm. The vesicles were then centrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 45 min and resuspended in the original buffer. Blocking with AMS was done in the same buffer, followed by centrifugation at 50,000 rpm for 45 min. The vesicles were resuspended in the same buffer, and labeled with MPB as described above. After labeling, membrane vesicles were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1.5% octyl glucoside, 0.1% deoxycholate, 0.5% cholate, 10 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole, and 1% Tween 20 (53Schneider E. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7279-7283Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated with agitation for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm (16,000 × g) for 10 min in a microcentrifuge (1.5 ml). The supernatant was added to 0.4 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin that had been previously equilibrated in the extraction buffer. The mixture was incubated with agitation for 45 min at room temperature, and centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 rpm. The resin was washed three times with 1 ml of wash buffer, consisting of equal volumes of extraction buffer and 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Subunit a was eluted by adding 0.25 ml of elution buffer (extraction buffer containing 1 mimidazole). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and centrifuged (16,000 × g) for 30 s. The supernatant containing the purified subunit a was collected and stored at −20 °C. Samples of purified subunit a were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm) using a Trans-Blot apparatus (Bio-Rad) overnight at 16 V. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% low fat powdered milk in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (TBS) for 1 h and rinsed with TBS/Tween 20 (0.05% Tween 20) three times. For MPB detection, the blocked membrane was incubated with avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase for 2 h, rinsed three times in TBS/Tween 20, and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium according to the manufacturer's instructions. For subunit a detection, the blocked nitrocellulose membrane was incubated at room temperature for 2 h with rabbit anti-a serum, diluted 1:5000. After washing five times with TBS/Tween 20, it was incubated with goat, anti-rabbit IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate at a dilution of 1:1000 for 2 h. After another five washings with TBS/Tween 20, color was developed as described above. Unique cysteine residues were introduced into subunit a at the following positions: 8, 24, 27, 69, 89, 128, 131, 172, 176, 196, 238, and 277 (COOH terminus). The resulting plasmids were transformed into RH305 (uncB205) and tested for growth on succinate minimal medium. All grew as well as wild type, but three other mutants grew poorly and were not further analyzed: 169 and two double mutants, 24/27 and 238/241. Everted membrane vesicles were prepared using a French pressure cell from cultures of E. coli cells bearing the unique cysteine mutations. Membranes were reacted with various concentrations of MPB from 10 μm to 1 mm, at temperatures from 0 to 25 °C, and for various lengths of time from 10 min to 1 h. The standard conditions chosen were the mildest under which significant labeling was detectable, to minimize the penetration of the membrane by MPB. The labeling patterns were the same whether or not the membranes were stripped of F1. The standard conditions included reaction at 25 °C for 15 min with 120 μm MPB, either with or without a pretreatment with the blocking reagent AMS under the same conditions. MPB (Fig. 3 A) is somewhat polar but can penetrate membranes at higher concentrations. AMS (Fig. 3 B) is highly charged and is much less able to cross biological membranes. Labeling by MPB that can be blocked completely by pretreatment with AMS is indicative of a cytoplasmic facing residue. Labeling by MPB that cannot be blocked by such AMS treatment is indicative of a residue that is not facing the cytoplasm (54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 55Hagting A. Velde J.V.D. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6777-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To detect labeling, the subunit a was extracted from membranes by solubilization with a mixture of detergents (cholate, deoxycholate, and octyl glucoside). The subunit a was partially purified via its oligohistidine using nickel affinity chromatography. The samples were electrophoresed, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with avidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase. Results are presented in Fig. 4 for each of the cysteine mutants. These are representative results of experiments performed at least four times. The labeling experiments were controlled for quantity of subunit a present by loading a second panel of samples and transferring to the same sheet of nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose was cut in half, and the second panel was probed with anti-a antibody. These results are presented in Fig. 5. Subunit a could be detected for all of the mutants except 277C, which was known to be expressed at low levels. Nevertheless, labeling of 277 was relatively high.Figure 5Immunoblots of purified samples of a subunit. A second loading of each of the samples shown in Fig. 4was carried out in the same polyacrylamide gel and was probed with anti-a antibody, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Labeling is according to Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results presented in Fig. 4 A show that the following residues can be both labeled by MPB and blocked completely by AMS, indicating a cytoplasm-facing location: 69, 172, 176, 277. In contrast, residues 8, 24, 27, and 131 can be labeled with MPB but cannot be blocked completely by pretreatment with AMS, indicating a location that does not face the cytoplasm. Other residues, 89, 128, 196, and 238, were not labeled at all under these conditions (data not shown). In Fig. 4 B, these residues were treated with higher concentrations of MPB, but little if any labeling was detected. In Fig. 5, it can be seen that of the residues that label very poorly, only 196C and 238C seem to be present at lower levels. The membrane topology of subunit a of the F1F0 ATP synthase from E. coli has been investigated previously, using several different experimental approaches (44Bjørbæk C. Foërsom V. Michelsen O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In this study, unique cysteine residues were introduced into subunit a and tested for accessibility to two maleimide reagents of differing water-solubility (54Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 843-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 55Hagting A. Velde J.V.D. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6777-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 56Bayer E.A. Zalia M.G. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 149: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A simple and reproducible method of preparation of oriented membrane vesicles was used, and multiple sites were probed in each region of subunit a. The results indicated that residues 69, 172, 176, and 277 (COOH terminus) are accessible to the cytoplasmic face, because they can be labeled by MPB, and this labeling can be blocked completely by AMS. Among these sites, a great range of reactivity exists, indicating greater exposure of residues 69 and 277 than the region of 172 and 176. Also, nearby residues, 89 and 196, were even more resistant to labeling. The labeling pattern of residues 8, 24, 27, and 131 suggests a periplasmic location for these residues, because although they are labeled by MPB, blocking by AMS was not complete. Again, there is a wide range of reactivity from the highly labeled residue 8 to the much less labeled 131. Again, a nearby residue, 128, was much more resistant to labeling. Finally, residue 238 could not be labeled at all. Such a result provides no topological information and could occur because of shielding by protein, including subunit b or c. Such interactions are discussed in the accompanying paper (48Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 16229-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Two previous studies of the membrane topology of subunit a using the alkaline phosphatase gene fusion technique have been reported (44Bjørbæk C. Foërsom V. Michelsen O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 45Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such experiments are complementary to those described here, because high activity of alkaline phosphatase is indicative of a periplasmic location of the site of the fusion. Each of the two studies offered eight-transmembrane span models for subunit a but were largely incompatible with each other. With the results presented here, there is now more direct evidence that several regions are cytoplasmic, and it is possible to bring the models into agreement. One of the decisions to be made in analysis of fusion studies is to determine a threshold activity for assigning periplasmic location. If this value were to be set at 20% of the maximal activity in the results of Bjørbæket al. (44Bjørbæk C. Foërsom V. Michelsen O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or at 25% in the results of Lewis et al. (45Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using LB-glucose, the same two periplasmic regions would be established in each study: near residues 116 and 229–241 in the first study (44Bjørbæk C. Foërsom V. Michelsen O. FEBS Lett. 1990; 260: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and residues 110–132 and 230–246 in the second study (45Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results support the first periplasmic assignment and are not in conflict with the second. Recent MPB labeling experiments using permeabilized cells support this second periplasmic region. 2T. Wada, J. C. Long, and S. B. Vik, unpublished results. A discrepancy does exist when considering the results of Lewis et al. (45Lewis M.J. Chang J.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10541-10550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using an LB growth medium lacking glucose. Under those conditions, they found two additional sites of high activity: at residue 200 (28% of maximum) and at the COOH terminus (83% of maximum). Similar results have been seen in other proteins when the site of fusion occurs at a cytoplasmic region without any positively charged residues to anchor COOH-terminal regions of the fusion protein to the cytoplasm (43Traxler B. Boyd D. Beckwith J. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 132: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In subunit a, lysine normally occurs at position 203, and at the COOH terminus there are no positively charged residues except the final residue, His271. In general, one might expect to encounter some difficulties when applying the alkaline phosphatase fusion technique to subunit a. It is now known by immunoblot analysis that subunit a is not found in membranes when either subunit b or c is missing (57Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2815-2817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More recently, subunit a was discovered to be a specific target of the ftsHprotease (58Akiyama Y. Kihara A. Ito K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 26-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Finally, a variety of results has indicated that the COOH-terminal region of subunit a is important in interactions with the other F0 subunits (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Vik S.B. Patterson A.R. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 16229-16234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 59Fraga D. Hermolin J. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2562-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Vik S.B. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8340-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Kumamoto C.A. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10037-10042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is not likely that subunit a fusions missing the COOH terminus will be able to assemble into an F0 complex, and the resulting topology might not be meaningful. The presence of the ftsHprotease adds another variable in interpretations of alkaline phosphatase activity levels of fusions with subunit a. Hydropathy analysis of the sequence of subunit a (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) reveals five potential transmembrane spans that are scored as “certain” by the method of von Heijne (42von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1395) Google Scholar) and one, residues 182–202, that is scored as “tentative.” The labeling results presented here indicate that there should be an even number of transmembrane spans between residues 176 and the COOH terminus. If the region 230–240 is periplasmic, as both alkaline phosphatase fusion studies indicated, then the “tentative” span is likely to be largely on the cytoplasmic surface. The most amino-terminal of the predicted transmembrane spans consists of residues 40–66. The labeling results indicate that residue 69 is cytoplasmic and that residues 8, 24, and 27 may be periplasmic, although seemingly significant levels of MPB labeling were blocked by AMS. The localization of the amino terminus to the periplasm is in disagreement with the results of studies using peptide-generated antibodies (Ref. 46Yamada H. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar; see also Ref. 3Deckers-Hebestreit G. Altendorf K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 791-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). At all other sites, those studies are in agreement with the labeling results presented here. Therefore, it may be useful to consider alternative interpretations. Lewis and Simoni (63Lewis M.J. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3482-3489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed the effect of a series of small deletions in subunit a on assembly and function. They found that deletions at the amino terminus, residues 2–35, had a great effect on the level of subunit a found in the membrane and also on the alkaline phosphatase activities of fusions made at residue 125. They concluded that the amino terminus is important for targeting subunit a to the cytoplasmic membrane or for insertion of subunit a into the membrane. A sequence alignment of the amino-terminal portion of subunit a fromE. coli and from several closely related organisms is shown in Fig. 6. A conserved region, residues 11–19, has been identified as capable of forming an amphipathic α-helix (62Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Two possibilities might explain why the amino-terminal residues seem to show accessibility to both sides of the membrane. First, this region might have a function, such as to act as an “intramolecular chaperone” for the folding and membrane assembly of subunit a. As a consequence of this role, it might have increased accessibility on the cytoplasmic surface. Second, the physical properties of this region may lead to artifactual exposure on the cytoplasmic surface during membrane preparation or may in some way contribute to its labeling. Experiments currently under way in our laboratory have demonstrated the accessibility this region of subunit a to the periplasm.2 Finally, a model of the membrane topology of subunit a is presented in Fig. 7, based on results presented here, and also on this reinterpretation of the alkaline phosphatase fusion studies. Transmembrane spans are all modeled as containing 28 residues. This is consistent with the difficulty of labeling many of the residues that have been tested and with hydropathy analysis (41Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 62Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these long spans would better match the length of the extremely hydrophobic subunits c, which have been shown by NMR analysis to contain similarly long α-helices (30Girvin M.E. Fillingame R.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Extramembranous segments that are modeled as helical are those that were predicted to be amphipathic, surface α-helices (62Vik S.B. Dao N.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1140: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The implications of this membrane topology model on the function of F0 are considered in the accompanying paper (48Vik S.B.

To date, domains of Tat previously found to interact with cell surface molecules have shown only partial chemotactic activity toward monocytes. Using overlapping Tat peptides, we identify a novel region of Tat with a potent chemotactic activity for monocytes, reaching levels equal to Tat itself. This peptide also provokes monocyte polarization similar to Tat and is able to compete with Tat for induction of monocyte migration. Specific high affinity (k d = 3 × 10−9m) cell surface binding sites on monocyte cell surfaces for this region of Tat are demonstrated. These data indicate that the majority of Tat effects on monocytes are mediated by a novel region in the cysteine-rich and core domains. These domains are highly conserved among different HIV isolates, suggesting an important role in the establishment of HIV infection.

Gatignol A. Glabe C.G. Fan H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6224-6233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to either enhance or permit post-initiation events (4Xiao H. Lis J.T. Jeang K.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6898-6905Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Recently, one key factor has been identified as cyclin T, which increases Tat-transactivating region interactions and allows for HIV LTR transactivation in otherwise nonpermissive rodent cells (5Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Although Tat has no signal peptide, this protein has also been found extracellularly, either released by cell lysis or via an alternative secretion pathway (6Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Man. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 87-114Google Scholar, 7Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Antibodies to Tat are frequently found in the sera of HIV patients (8Franchini G. Robert G.M. Aldovini A. Kan N.C. Wong S.F.

Extracellular Tat has been proposed to have a wide range of activities, including entry into cells and HIV LTR transactivation of neighboring cells (10Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O.

In addition, Tat has been reported to have activity as a growth factor for Kaposi's sarcoma (13Ensoli B. Barillari G. Salahuddin S.Z. Gallo R. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and endothelial cells (14Albini A. Barillari G. Benelli R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These data explain the angiogenic properties of HIV Tat in vitro (14Albini A. Barillari G. Benelli R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

One domain contains an RGD sequence that is a ligand for several integrins (19Brake D. Debouck C. Biesecker G. J.

Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 15Albini A. Benelli R. Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Rubartelli A. Paglialunga G. Bussolino F. Noonan D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar) and to have the ability to activate the tyrosine kinase receptor KDR (16Albini A. Soldi R. Giunciuglio D. Giraudo E. Benelli R. Primo L. Noonan D. Salio M. Camussi G. Rockl W. Bussolino F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Recently Tat has been found to induce monocyte cell adhesion to endothelial cells (22Lafrenie R.M. Wahl L.M. Epstein J.S. Hewlett I.K. Yamada K.M. Dhawan S. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1638-1645PubMed Google Scholar), as well as migration and invasion of monocytes (23Lafrenie R.M. Wahl L.M. Epstein J.S. Hewlett I.K. Yamada K.M. Dhawan S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 974-977PubMed Google Scholar). Monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells appear to play a critical role in establishment of HIV infection (24Granelli-Piperno A. Moser B. Pope M. Chen D. Wei Y. Isdell F. O'Doherty U. Paxton W. Koup R. Mojsov S. Bhardwaj N. Clark L.I. Baggiolini M. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2433-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Balter M. Science. 1996; 274: 1464-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The ability of Tat, released from a cell actively producing virus, to attract additional target cells could contribute to the rapid and extensive HIV spread. The Tat domains involved in activation of monocyte chemotaxis have not yet been fully elucidated. Roles for integrins (23Lafrenie R.M. Wahl L.M. Epstein J.S. Hewlett I.K. Yamada K.M. Dhawan S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 974-977PubMed Google Scholar) and the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt (26Mitola S. Sozzani S. Luini W. Primo L. Bosatti A. Weich H. Bussolino F. Blood. 1997; 90: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been proposed. However, recent studies have shown that both the RGD and basic domains contain only partial activity in induction of monocyte migration (27Benelli R. Mortarini R. Anichini A. Giunciuglio D. Noonan D.M. Montalti S. Tacchetti C. Albini A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition, no additive effects were observed when both peptides were utilized. Finally, the RGD domain is poorly conserved among HIV-1 isolates and not present in HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus Tat (28Jeang K.-T. The Human Retroviruses and AIDS Compendium On Line. 1994; (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov)Google Scholar). These data suggest that activation of integrins, tyrosine kinase receptors, or both does not account for the full chemotactic activity of Tat. Utilizing cells producing Tat under the control of the HIV LTR, we demonstrate that sufficient native Tat is released to enhance monocyte chemotaxis. A series of overlapping peptides was used to scan for monocyte chemotactic and polarizing activity. A peptide spanning the cysteine and core domains showed extremely potent activity, inducing monocyte migration to an extent equivalent to that of Tat itself. This peptide was shown to specifically bind to monocyte cell surfaces and was displaced by Tat with a high affinity. Significant activity was found in a peptide corresponding to the cysteine-rich domain of Tat. These data suggest that this novel, conserved region plays a key role in the attraction of monocytes/macrophages toward productive HIV-infected cells. Conditioned media from T53 cells (29Corallini A. Altavilla G. Pozzi L. Bignozzi F. Negrini M. Rimessi P. Gualandi F. Barbanti-Brodano G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5569-5575PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared by incubation of the cells for 24 h in SFM. The levels of Tat in the conditioned medium were determined by a simple immunoblot assay. Conditioned medium was concentrated 10-fold on a Centriprep 3 (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) ultrafilter and brought to 100 μl with PBS-BSA. Serial dilutions of Tat in 100 μl of PBS with 0.1% BSA were prepared and blotted along with the T-53 conditioned media and negative controls (basic fibroblast growth factor in PBS-BSA and PBS-BSA alone) onto a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane (Sigma) filter saturated in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) in a 96-well manifold blot device (Schelcher & Schuell). The filter was then blocked with 3% BSA in PBS and then incubated with a specific anti-Tat monoclonal antibody (Arnika, Milan, Italy) in PBS with 0.1% Tween for 2 h. The filter was rinsed in PBS/Tween and incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody for 1 h, again rinsed, and developed using the ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) protocol and exposed to x-ray film. The autoradiograph was scanned and quantitated using the NIH Image program. Background was subtracted, and Tat dilutions in the liner range were utilized to determine a standard curve. The relative Tat content in the conditioned media was calculated. For Western blotting, concentrated supernatants were by electrophoresis under reducing conditions on a 15% acrylamide gel. The gel was electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride Immobilon-P membrane that was blocked and processed as above. In addition to T53 cells, for Western blotting conditioned media were also prepared from untransfected PC12 cells and PC12 cells transfected with a Tat expression construct (30Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Previati M. Capitani S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The supernatants were used as chemoattractants for monocytes either alone or after immunodepletion. Immunodepletion of Tat was done by incubation overnight at 4 °C on a shaking platform with anti-Tat monoclonal antibodies (Arnika, Milan, Italy) attached to anti-mouse Ig-coated magnetic beads (Immunotech, Marseille, France). Incubation with an isotype-matched anti-saporin monoclonal antibody was used as a control. After incubation the beads were removed by a magnetic field, and supernatants were utilized in the chemotaxis assay as described below. Buffy coats, obtained through the courtesy of the Blood Transfusion Center of Istituto G. Gaslini, Genova, were diluted 1:3 in saline and centrifuged on Ficoll-Hypaque density gradients at 800 × g for 40 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected at the interface were washed several times in PBS containing 2% BSA to remove platelets. The suspension was further purified by centrifugation on a 45% (d = 1.062) isotonic Percoll (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) gradient according to the manufacturer's instructions. Monocyte-enriched populations (consisting of >85% of monocytes as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence with anti-CD14 monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry) were obtained from the Percoll interface. Synthetic Tat1–86 protein and a series of overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to amino acids 20–80 of Tat: Cys20–39, CysL24–51, basic (amino acids 46–60), Pep56–70, and RGD (amino acids 65–80), as well as short internal peptides (Cys23–29, Cys29–33, and Cys29–50) and a mutated peptide (CysL24–51 mutated) (Tecnogen, Caserta, Italy) were dissolved in PBS-BSA (PBS with 0.1% BSA (highly purified, fatty acid-free, Sigma), and 10 mm dithiothreitol) aliquoted at 1 μg/10 μl and stored at −80 °C. ControlN-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (f-MLP) peptide (Sigma) was dissolved in Me2SO to 0.1 m and then diluted in water to 1 μm, aliquoted in 10-μl stocks, and stored at −20 °C. Cell migration was evaluated using a chemotaxis microchamber technique (31Falk W. Goodwin J.R. Leonard E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) according to Martinet et al. (32Martinet Y. Martinet N. Vignaud J.-M. Plenat F. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The lower wells were filled with 27 μl of chemoattractant-containing solution or control medium (RPMI 0.1% BSA: highly purified, low fatty acids, Sigma) forming a convex meniscus. A polycarbonate filter (5-μm pore size, polyvinylpyrrolidone-free Nucleopore) was layered onto the wells and covered with a silicon gasket and the top plate. The upper chamber was seeded with 50 μl of a monocyte cell suspension (0.5–1 × 107 cells/ml) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After the incubation the filters were recovered, and nonmigrated cells were removed from the upper surface, fixed in absolute ethanol, and stained with toluidine blue. Five to ten fields were counted for each point using a microscope (40× objective, Zeiss). The results are expressed as the mean number of migrated cells/field; each experiment was performed in sestuplicate. For checkerboard analysis, chemoattractants were added in the upper chamber with the cells or in the lower chamber as indicated. Monocyte polarization was assessed by the procedure of Locati et al. (33Locati M. Zhou D. Luini W. Evangelista V. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4746-4753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Freshly purified monocytes (5 × 105/500 μl) were preincubated at 37 °C in polypropylene tubes for 5 min and then treated with stimuli for 10–30 min. The assay was stopped by adding an equal volume of cool 10% formaldehyde in PBS. The percentage of polarized monocytes was determined by placing 10 μl of cell suspension in a Bürker hemocytometer and counting the number of polarized cells over the total number of cells by microscopy. The CysL21–54 peptide was 125I-radiolabeled by incubation for with Na[125I] and lactoperoxidase under standard conditions. The reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of 0.4 m NaCl, 0.05% CHAPS, and 0.2% BSA, and the radiolabeled peptide was purified on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Monocytes were plated in 96-well microtiter plates for 2 h at 37 °C in Binding Buffer (RPMI with 1% BSA and 20 mmHepes). Buffer was removed, and 50 μl of binding buffer containing 80 ng ml−1 125I-radiolabeled CysL21–54 peptide (800 μCi nmol−1) was premixed with the increasing concentrations of unlabeled competitor (CysL21–54 peptide or Tat1–86). Cells were incubated for 40 min at 20 °C with gentle agitation. At the end of incubation, the cells were washed quickly with 200 μl of ice-cold binding buffer. Bound radioactivity was determined by solubilization with PBS-1% SDS for 10 min with shaking and counting in a Beckman γ counter. Background binding to identically treated wells without cells was subtracted (approximately 10% of the total bound). Scatchard analysis was performed using the Ligand (Biosoft) program. Although it has been demonstrated that recombinant or synthetic Tat proteins are chemotactic for monocytes (23Lafrenie R.M. Wahl L.M. Epstein J.S. Hewlett I.K. Yamada K.M. Dhawan S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 974-977PubMed Google Scholar, 26Mitola S. Sozzani S. Luini W. Primo L. Bosatti A. Weich H. Bussolino F. Blood. 1997; 90: 1365-1372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Benelli R. Mortarini R. Anichini A. Giunciuglio D. Noonan D.M. Montalti S. Tacchetti C. Albini A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), there is no evidence that native Tat can attract monocytes or that sufficient Tat can be released from cells to significantly affect monocyte migration. To address whether native Tat released from cells can contribute to monocyte migration, we used supernatants from T53 cells, an HIV-1 LTR-driven Tat-expressing cell line derived from Tat transgenic mice (29Corallini A. Altavilla G. Pozzi L. Bignozzi F. Negrini M. Rimessi P. Gualandi F. Barbanti-Brodano G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5569-5575PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that T53 clones secrete Tat in varying amounts (34Corallini A. Campioni D. Rossi C. Albini A. Possati L. Rusnati M. Gazzanelli G. Benelli R. Masiello L. Sparacciari V. Presta M. Mannello F. Fontanini G. Barbanti-Brodano G. AIDS. 1996; 10: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Here we show that the parental T53 cells release Tat into the medium, accumulating approximately 4.4 ng/ml in 24 h conditioned medium (Fig. 1 a). Western blotting demonstrated that the released Tat was intact (Fig. 1 b); no reactivity is found in the absence of Tat expression. Similar levels of Tat have been observed in the supernatants of HIV IIIB-infected H9 cells (35Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), suggesting that productive HIV-infected cells release substantial amounts of Tat into the local environment. The conditioned medium supernatants from T53 cells potently attracted monocytes (Fig. 1 c). Clearance of the secreted Tat in these supernatants with monoclonal anti-Tat antibodies significantly decreased migration as compared with untreated supernatants or to supernatants treated with a nonrelevant antibody (p < 0.0001 using Student'st test in both cases) (Fig. 1 c). These data indicated that native Tat, expressed under the HIV LTR and released from cells, can indeed influence monocyte chemotaxis. We previously demonstrated that both the Tat RGD and basic domains show partial chemotactic activity for monocytes (27Benelli R. Mortarini R. Anichini A. Giunciuglio D. Noonan D.M. Montalti S. Tacchetti C. Albini A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, these peptides did not show additive effects when used together or completely reproduce the chemotactic potential of Tat1–86, suggesting that other domains may be involved (27Benelli R. Mortarini R. Anichini A. Giunciuglio D. Noonan D.M. Montalti S. Tacchetti C. Albini A. AIDS. 1998; 12: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We therefore examined additional overlapping Tat peptides for chemotactic activity, comparing the activity of each on an equimolar basis. The peptide Pep56–70, which encompasses the sequence between the RGD and basic regions, showed no migration above background (Fig. 2 a), even at high concentrations (not shown). In contrast, the CysL24–51 peptide, which extends from the beginning of the basic domain through most of the cysteine-rich domain, showed a potent chemotactic activity that exceeded that of other peptides (Fig. 2 a). A peptide that covers only the entire cysteine-rich domain (Cys20–39) showed significant chemotactic activity, although less than the CysL24–51 peptide. The induction of monocyte polarization is a very sensitive assay for monocyte stimulation. When the peptides were tested on an equimolar basis for their ability to induce monocyte polarization, the Cys20–39peptide showed a level of activity comparable with the basic or RGD domains (Fig. 2 b). The CysL24–51 peptide was even more potent, approaching levels of polarization induced by intact Tat or f-MLP (Fig. 2 b). Again, the Pep56–70peptide had no activity. Taken together, these data suggest that the majority of monocyte chemotactic and polarizing activity of Tat resides within the CysL24–51 region. Because substantial activity was also observed with the Cys20–39 peptide, the cysteine-rich domain appears to play an important role in monocyte stimulation and chemotaxis. The CysL24–51 peptide dose-dependently increased monocyte migration and could completely reproduce the chemotactic effects of intact Tat1–86 (Fig. 3 a), reaching levels comparable with that of the powerful monocyte chemoattractant f-MLP peptide. The Tat activity was evident at 10 ng/ml and comparable at equal concentrations to a known monocyte chemoattractant of similar molecular weight, MCP-3. Checkerboard analysis indicated that the CysL24–51 peptide (not shown) displayed similar chemokinetic and chemotactic activity as that reported for intact Tat1–86 (23Lafrenie R.M. Wahl L.M. Epstein J.S. Hewlett I.K. Yamada K.M. Dhawan S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 974-977PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggested that the CysL24–51 domains may be responsible for the majority of the Tat effects on monocytes. We then tested whether the CysL24–51 peptide could compete with intact Tat1–86 in induction of monocyte migration. The migration induced by Tat1–86 in the lower compartment of Boyden chemotaxis chambers was inhibited by the presence of the CysL24–51 peptide in the upper compartment and vice versa (Fig. 3 b). These data further support the hypothesis that monocyte migration induced by Tat is largely mediated by the cysteine-rich and core Tat domains. The amino acid regions within the CysL24–51 peptide critical for its chemotactic activity were further examined (Fig. 3 c). A peptide corresponding to the CysL24–51but with the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain truncated (Cys29–50) showed substantial activity, comparable with the powerful CysL24–51 peptide, at high concentrations. However, at lower concentrations the Cys29–50 peptide showed a marked loss of activity. These data suggested that some of the N-terminal cysteine residues partially contribute to the chemotactic activity. Two smaller peptides within the cysteine-rich domain (Cys23–29 and Cys29–33) both showed reduced activity as compared with the Cys20–39 peptide encompassing the entire cysteine-rich domain (Fig. 3 c). These data suggest that the residues Cys25, Cys27, Cys30, Cys31, Cys34, and Cys37 are important in chemotactic activity. Of these cysteine residues, we noted that Cys31was the only residue not found to be critical for Tat transactivating activity; yet this residue is highly conserved throughout various Tat isolates (see Ref. 28Jeang K.-T. The Human Retroviruses and AIDS Compendium On Line. 1994; (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov)Google Scholar for review). We therefore synthesized a peptide, CysL24–51 mutated, with Cys31 and the two amino acids flanking it, Cys30 and Phe32, changed to Ser30-Ser31-Gly32. This peptide had significantly less chemotactic capacity than the CysL24–51 peptide (Fig. 3 c), demonstrating that these sequences are important for induction of monocyte migration. However, the lack of activity in the Cys29–33 peptide, which contains all these residues, suggests that they alone are not sufficient and that several other residues in the cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat also have an important role in interaction with monocytes. To test the possibility that the CysL24–51peptide directly elicited monocyte chemotaxis and polarization by interaction with a cell surface receptor, its binding to monocyte cell surfaces was examined. The CysL24–51 peptide does not contain the domains of Tat known to interact with integrins (RGD) (19Brake D. Debouck C. Biesecker G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or tyrosine kinase receptors (basic) (16Albini A. Soldi R. Giunciuglio D. Giraudo E. Benelli R. Primo L. Noonan D. Salio M. Camussi G. Rockl W. Bussolino F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar); thus binding to these receptors was excluded. Radiolabeled CysL24–51 peptide showed specific binding to monocyte cell surfaces that was effectively competed by an excess of unlabeled peptide (Fig. 4 a). The IC50 for competition with the peptide itself was approximately 32 nm. The binding of the CysL24–51 peptide was even more effectively competed for by intact Tat1–86, with an IC50 of approximately 1.25 nm, indicating that Tat has a substantially higher affinity for the same receptors interacting with the CysL24–51 peptide (Fig. 4 a). Scatchard analysis of Tat competition for CysL24–51 peptide binding to monocytes gave an affinity for Tat of 3.1 ± 0.2 nm with 960 ± 10 sites/cell (Fig. 4 b). Scatchard analysis of the CysL24–51 peptide competition showed that its affinity was 50-fold lower (170 ± 33 nm) with 27450 ± 11030 sites/cell (not shown). These data clearly show that the CysL24–51 peptide can bind to monocyte surfaces through specific receptor(s) and that Tat has an even higher affinity for these same receptors. Thus the cysteine/core domain of Tat interacts with receptors on monocyte cell surfaces that appear to mediate monocyte chemotaxis. Recent attention has focused on the role of monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells in the initial phases of HIV infection (24Granelli-Piperno A. Moser B. Pope M. Chen D. Wei Y. Isdell F. O'Doherty U. Paxton W. Koup R. Mojsov S. Bhardwaj N. Clark L.I. Baggiolini M. Steinman R.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 2433-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 25Balter M. Science. 1996; 274: 1464-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 36Huang Y. Paxton W.A. Wolinsky S.M. Neumann A.U. Zhang L. He T. Kang S. Ceradini D. Jin Z. Yazdanbakhsh K. Kunstman K. Erickson D. Dragon E. Landau N.R. Phair J. Ho D.D. Koup R.A. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (1204) Google Scholar). Macrophage tropic strains appear to dominate in the early stages of infection, where massive viremia is rapidly obtained and HIV is disseminated throughout the host. HIV products released from productively infected mononuclear cells could attract additional monocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells to the region of virion release, thus significantly contributing to viral spread and establishment of infection. HIV Tat, which may be released in substantial levels by cells lysed during virus production, could substantially contribute to this activity. A similar chemotactic activity toward CD4+ T-cells has been observed for HIV envelope (37Weissman D. Rabin R.L. Arthos J. Rubbert A. Dybul M. Swofford R. Venkatesan S. Farber J.M. Fauci A.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 981-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). The HIV-1 Tat protein appears to be released from cells either via an alternative secretion pathway or by cell death (6Rubartelli A. Sitia R. Unusual Secretory Pathways: From Bacteria to Man. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 87-114Google Scholar, 7Chang H.C. Samaniego F. Nair B.C. Buonaguro L. Ensoli B. AIDS. 1997; 11: 1421-1431Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that extracellular release of Tat occurs in HIV-infected individuals, including the relatively high percentage of patients with antibodies to Tat (8Franchini G. Robert G.M. Aldovini A. Kan N.C. Wong S.F. Blood. 1987; 69: 437-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9McPhee D.A. Kemp B.E. Cumming S. Stapleton D. Gust I.D. Doherty R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and that a substantial percentage of patient sera were found to contain Tat at concentrations up to 1 ng/ml (35Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The presence of detectable Tat in sera may reflect viremia, and local levels of Tat are probably elevated in sites of high viral replication (35Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Extracellular release of Tat, as well as anti-Tat antibody titers, have been suggested to play a role in AIDS progression (38Re M.C. Furlini G. Vignoli M. Ramazzotti E. Roderigo G. DeRosa V. Zauli G. Lolli S. Capitani S. LaPlaca M. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. Hum. Retrovirol. 1995; 10: 408-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have shown that T53 cells, which synthesize Tat under the control of the HIV LTR, release approximately 4 ng/ml of Tat into conditioned medium. Native Tat released from cells appears to be somewhat more potent than synthetic Tat at inducing monocyte chemotaxis, as may be expected. However, as proteins diffuse in a gradient, the levels of Tat in the environment around a Tat-producing cell will be even higher. Most cells in culture secrete a mixture of chemotactic factors. Conditioned medium from a similar cell line that did not express Tat (TTB, (34Corallini A. Campioni D. Rossi C. Albini A. Possati L. Rusnati M. Gazzanelli G. Benelli R. Masiello L. Sparacciari V. Presta M. Mannello F. Fontanini G. Barbanti-Brodano G. AIDS. 1996; 10: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar)) showed significantly less chemotactic potential than that from T53 cells (data not shown). Immunodepletion demonstrated that Tat synthesis significantly contributes to the induction of monocyte chemotaxis. Concentrations of Tat similar to that released by T53 cells were found in media conditioned by H9 cell cultures infected with HIV (35Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that sufficient Tat can be released by HIV-infected cells in vivo to affect the migration and activation of nearby mononuclear cells. Recent data indicate that most HIV-1 Tat proteins are a larger 101/102-amino acid protein (28Jeang K.-T. The Human Retroviruses and AIDS Compendium On Line. 1994; (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov)Google Scholar), in contrast to the 86-amino acid peptide used in most studies to date. A Tat79–101 peptide, as well as the N-terminal Tat1–24 peptide, did not elicit monocyte chemotaxis or polarization (not shown). The chemotactic and polarizing activity of Tat could essentially be completely substituted by the CysL24–51 peptide. Interestingly, this peptide encompasses the two most conserved region of Tat, the cysteine-rich and “core” domains. These domains are very well conserved among different isolates of HIV-1 (28Jeang K.-T. The Human Retroviruses and AIDS Compendium On Line. 1994; (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov)Google Scholar), as well as in HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus. Such conservation suggests a critical function for Tat that may extend beyond HIV transactivation, as previously suggested (39Huang L.M. Joshi A. Willey R. Orenstein J. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2886-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 40Neuveut C. Jeang K.T. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the cysteine-rich domain alone harbors a significant portion of the monocyte chemotactic activity. This domain has seven cysteines, all of which are strongly conserved, even though experimental evidence indicates that some are not required for transactivation (28Jeang K.-T. The Human Retroviruses and AIDS Compendium On Line. 1994; (http://hiv-web.lanl.gov)Google Scholar). These data again suggest that this domain of Tat could harbor key activities not associated with transactivation. The cysteine-rich and core domains of Tat appear to interact with high affinity receptor(s) on monocyte cell surfaces. The high affinity displacement of radiolabeled peptide by Tat1–86 clearly indicates that intact Tat interacts with the same receptor(s). Tat interactions through this region appear to be the major mediators of Tat effects on monocyte polarization and migration. This is the first indication that the cysteine-rich and core Tat domains could interact with cell surface receptors. This interaction appears to be specific for accessory cells, because similar peptide mapping on PC12 cells showed activity in the basic domain, but not in residues 1–45 (41Weeks B.S. Desai K. Loewenstein P.M. Klotman M.E. Klotman P.E. Green M. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5279-5284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the CysL24–51 peptide was also inactive on endothelial cells (data not shown). The nature and identity of these potential new receptors on accessory cells have not yet been determined.

Zoppetti, A. Albini, D. Noonan, F. d'Adda di Fagagna, M. Giacca, and M. Presta (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 11313–11320). On this basis, the glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-TatR49/52/53/55/56/57Amutant, in which six arginine residues within the basic domain of Tat were mutagenized to alanine residues, was compared with GST-Tat for its capacity to bind immobilized heparin. Dissociation of the GST-TatR49/52/53/55/56/57A·heparin complex occurred at ionic strength significantly lower than that required to dissociate the GST-Tat·heparin complex. Accordingly, heparin binds immobilized GST-Tat and GST-TatR49/52/53/55/56/57A with a dissociation constant equal to 0.3 and 1.0 μm, respectively. Also, the synthetic basic domain Tat-(41–60) competes with GST-Tat for heparin binding.

Moreover, extracellular Tat appears to be responsible for the burst of virus replication that takes place at the beginning of HIV infection (46Peterlin B.M. Adams M. Alonso A. Baur A. Ghosh S. Lu X.

Finally, Tat exerts negative effects on the immune system also by repressing the transcription of the major histocompatibility complex class I gene (51Howcroft T.K. Strebel K. Martin M.A. Singer D.S. Science. 1993; 260: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), by inhibiting antigen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and generation of functional suppressive CD8+ cells (52Viscidi R.P.

Thus, from the bulk of data it emerges that extracellular Tat may be implicated both in the progression of AIDS and in the pathogenesis of several AIDS-associated diseases. On this basis, Tat protein should be considered as a target for novel anti-HIV strategies. Tat protein is a polypeptide of 86–102 amino acids depending on the viral strain, which is encoded by two exons and is translated from multiply spliced 2-kilobase mRNAs (56Schwartz S. Felber B.K. Benko D.M. Fenyo E.M. Pavlakis G.N. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2519-2529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence 1–72 encoded by the first exon is endowed with full transactivating activity (3Sodroski J.G. Patarca R. Rosen C. Wong-Staal F. Haseltine W.A. Science. 1985; 229: 74-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 4Arya S.K Guo C. Josephs S.F. Wong-Staal F. Science. 1985; 229: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 57Cullen B.R. Cell. 1990; 63: 655-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), while the carboxyl-terminal region encoded by the second exon (amino acids 72–86) is not required either for the transactivating activity of Tat or for the replication of HIV-1 (5Sodroski J.G.

Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7941-7945Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Within the sequence encoded by the first exon of tat is present a so-called basic domain (amino acids 49–57) constituted by a stretch of repeated Arg and Lys residues. This highly immunoreactive region is well conserved among Tat proteins isolated from different strains of HIV-1 (47Goldstein G. Nat. Med. 1996; 1: 960-964Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 63Gregoire C.J. Loret E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22641-22646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The basic domain is implicated in several aspects of Tat biology. Indeed, it is necessary for Tat stability (64Hauber J. Malim M.H. Cullen B.R. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), nuclear and nucleolar delivery (65Endo S. Kubota S. Siomi H. Adachi A. Oroszlan S. Maki M. Hatanaka M.

Presta M. Rusnati M. Ziche M. Rubartelli A. Paglialunga G. Bussolino F. Noonan D. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 289-297PubMed Google Scholar). The basic domain cooperates with the RGD motif in the interaction of Tat protein with integrins (61Vogel B.E. Lee S.-U. Hildebrand A. Craig W. Pierschbacher D. Wong-Staal F. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and it is implicated in Tat binding and activation of the Flk-1/KDR receptor (67Albini A. Soldi R. Giunciuglio D. Giraudo E. Benelli R. Primo L. Noonan D. Salio M. Camussi G. Rockl W. Bussolino F. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 1371-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Tat protein binds to cell surface heparan sulfate (HS) and heparin (68Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar,69Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This interaction occurs through the negatively charged sulfate groups of the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (68Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), suggesting that the positively charged Arg and Lys residues present within the basic domain of Tat may be responsible for the interaction. Soluble polysulfated GAGs can inhibit the transactivating activity of extracellular Tat, and their inhibitory action appears to be directly related to their capacity to bind Tat protein (68Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Albini A. Noonan D. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Giacca M. Presta M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11313-11320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These observations point to the basic domain of Tat as a preferential molecular target for polysulfated compounds able to interact with extracellular Tat protein and neutralize its biological activity. Suramin is a polysulfonated naphthylurea originally developed for the treatment of trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis. Suramin has been used recently in the treatment of cancer (70Hawkins M.J. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1995; 7: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In vitro, suramin blocks the activity of several growth factors by inhibiting their binding to cognate receptors (71Coffey R.J. Leof E.B. Shipley G. Moses H.L. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 132: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 72Braddock P.S. Hu D.E. Fan T.-P. Stratford I.J. Harris A.L. Bicknell R. Br. J.

Cell. 1996; 7: 369-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Suramin inhibits the activity of heparanase (74Nakajima M. DeChavigny A. Johnson C.E. Hamada J. Stein C.A. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9661-9666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (29Rusnati M. Coltrini D. Campioni D. Tanghetti E. Corallini A. Barbanti-Brodano G. Gibellini D. Presta M. AIDS. 1997; 11: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 75Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5985-5989Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, suramin inhibits cell adhesion and migration (76Zabrenetzky V.S. Kohn E.C. Roberts D.D. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 5937-5942PubMed Google Scholar). All of these in vitro activities may explain, at least in part, the capacity of suramin to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis in different experimental models (77Sola F. Farao M. Marsiglio A. Mariani M. Grandi M. Invasion Metastasis. 1993; 13: 163-168PubMed Google Scholar, 78Pesenti E. Sola F. Mongelli N. Grandi M. Spreafico F. Br. J. Cancer. 1992; 66: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). As an angiogenesis inhibitor, suramin has been demonstrated to inhibit the activity exerted by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and vascular endothelial growth factor on cultured endothelial cells by preventing their interaction with cell surface HS-proteoglycans and tyrosine-kinase receptors and to block their angiogenic activity in different animal models (see Ref. 79Fan T.-P. Jaggar R. Bicknell R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar and references therein). This is due, at least in part, to the capacity of suramin to bind to the heparin-binding region of the growth factor via one or more of its sulfate groups. Accordingly, suramin is able to mimic heparin/HS for the capacity to protect FGF2 from trypsin digestion. Interestingly, the same capacity was observed for the related polysulfonated compound trypan blue (80Coltrini D. Rusnati M. Zoppetti G. Grazioli G. Naggi A. Presta M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 214: 51-58Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this work, we have characterized the interaction of heparin, suramin, and suramin-related compounds with Tat protein, focusing on the role played by the basic domain of Tat in this interaction. The data demonstrate the possibility of synthesizing polysulfonated, heparin-mimicking compounds equipotent to natural heparin in interfering with the biological activity of extracellular Tat. Suramin was from Bayer AG (Leverkusen, Germany). Trypan blue was from Sigma. Heparin (13.6 kDa) was from Laboratori Derivati Organici SpA (Milan, Italy). Chondroitin sulfate C was a gift of M. Del Rosso (University of Florence, Italy). β-Cyclodextrin tetradecasulfate was from Consultants on Glycosaminoglycans (Milan, Italy). The PNU compounds are suramin-related distamycin A derivatives (81Clanton D.J. Buckheit R.W. Terpening S.J. Kiser R. Mongelli N. Borgia A.L. Schultz R. Narayanan V. Bader J.P. Rice W.G. Antivir.

This antibody recognizes with the same efficiency all of the Tat mutants utilized in this study (data not shown). The synthetic peptides representing the amino acid sequences 1–20, 41–60, and 71–85 of HIV-1 Tat (virus strain HIV-1 LAI) were obtained from the Medical Research Council AIDS Reagent Project (National Institute for Biological Standards and Control, Potters Bar, Herts, UK). The synthetic peptides representing the sequences 103–120 and 103–146 of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) were kind gifts from A. Baird (Prizm Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). Recombinant wild type HIV-1 Tat and the different Tat mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The respective plasmid constructs are derivatives of plasmid pGST-Tat 2E, which was originally obtained by cloning the coding region of both exons of HIV-1HXB2 Tat in the commercial vector pGEX2T, as already described (82Demarchi F. d'Adda di Fagagna F. Falaschi A. Giacca M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4427-4437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This construct codes for the wild type 86-amino acid Tat protein. The mutated derivatives include GST-Tat-1e (containing one-exon Tat and comprising the first 72 amino acids of the protein), GST-TatΔ1–21 (containing a deletion of the amino acid sequence 1–21), GST-TatH13E (containing a mutation of histidine 13 to glutamine), and GST-TatK49/52/53/55/56/57A(in which the arginine residues at positions 49, 52, 53, 55, 56, and 57 in the basic domain were mutated to alanine residues). These constructs were obtained by a recombinant polymerase chain reaction procedure using overlapping oligonucleotides corresponding to the mutated sequences; a detailed description of the construction of these mutants as well as of their transcriptional properties will be presented elsewhere. 3M. Giacca, manuscript in preparation. Recombinant fusion proteins were purified to homogeneity from bacterial lysates by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with minor modifications. Briefly, lysates were mixed with 1 ml of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione cross-linked agarose beads (Sigma). The fusion protein was allowed to bind to the beads at 4 °C on a rotating wheel for 1 h. The suspension was then loaded on an empty plastic column, letting the unbound proteins pass through, and the beads were submitted to a high salt wash (0.8 m NaCl) to free the fusion protein from contaminating bacterial nucleic acids. The fusion protein was eluted in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol and 20 mm free glutathione (Sigma). The purity and integrity of the protein was routinely checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining. Usually, this purification procedure leads to >95% purification of the recombinant proteins. The purified proteins were stored in aliquots at −80 °C until use. The T53 cell"

In vitro, these kinases rapidly autophosphorylate, predominantly on their carboxyl-terminal extensions, and this autophosphorylation markedly inhibits kinase activity (Cegielska, A., Gietzen, K. F., Rivers, A., and Virshup, D. M. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 1357–1364). However, we now report that while these kinases are able to autophosphorylatein vivo, they are actively maintained in the dephosphorylated, active state by cellular protein phosphatases. Treatment of cells with the cell-permeable serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid or calyculin A leads to rapid increases in kinase intramolecular autophosphorylation.

The founding member of the nuclear family, HRR25, was first cloned in a screen for budding yeast mutants sensitive to DNA double strand breaks (3Hoekstra M.F. Liskay R.M. Ou A.C. DeMaggio A.J.

The mammalian homologs of these genes are the closely related CKIε and CKIδ; they encode monomeric protein kinases that are 97% identical to each other over the kinase domain and 53% identical over their 124 amino acid carboxyl-terminal extensions (6Graves P.R.

In fact, the human CKIε gene partially complements Saccharomyces cerevisiae with a deletion of the HRR25 gene (7Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

A number of the substrates identified to date for the CKI family also support a role for the kinase in regulation of DNA repair and replication. For example, phosphorylation of SV40 large T antigen blocks its ability to unwind the SV40 origin of replication (8Cegielska A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1202-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 9Cegielska A. Moarefi I. Fanning E. Virshup D.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 269-275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cegielska A.

CKI also phosphorylates several isoforms of the rad24 and rad25-related 14–3-3 proteins, regulating their ability to bind to substrate proteins (12Dubois T. Rommel C. Howell S. Steinhussen U.

Purified CKIε can phosphorylate the carboxyl terminus of IκBα, potentially regulating its degradation rate (10Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Most recently, CKIε and CKIδ have been identified as the cellular kinases that constitutively phosphorylate the extreme amino terminus of p53 (5Knippschild U. Milne D.M. Campbell L.E. DeMaggio A.J. Christenson E. Hoekstra M.F. Meek D.W. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1727-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).CKI genes appear widely and constitutively expressed, but despite the progress in defining a role for CKI isoforms in the cell, a detailed understanding of the regulation of CKI activity is lacking. Several lines of evidence suggest the carboxyl-terminal tails of CKIδ and CKIε contain an important autoregulatory domain. First, CKIε, with a 124-amino acid carboxyl-terminal extension, complements hrr25Δ yeast, while CKIα, with a 24-amino acid extension, does not (7Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). CKIδ and CKIε both display a significant increase in specific activity when the carboxyl terminus is removed (10Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 15Graves P.R. Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21689-21694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More strikingly, CKIε rapidly autophosphorylates in vitro in an intramolecular reaction that substantially inhibits kinase activity toward a number of protein substrates. CKIε, but not a mutant lacking the carboxyl terminus, can then be activated up to 20-fold by dephosphorylation (10Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that changes in the phosphorylation state of CKIδ and CKIε carboxyl termini in vivo may be an important mechanism for regulation of the kinase activity.In the present study, we investigated the autoregulatory autophosphorylation of CKIε and CKIδ in vivo. Unexpectedly, we found that in cultured cells and in tissues, these kinases are actively maintained in the dephosphorylated state. While the kinases are indeed able to rapidly autophosphorylate in vivo as well as in vitro, they are maintained in the dephosphorylated state in vivo by rapid constitutive dephosphorylation by cellular protein phosphatases sensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A. These results indicate that CKIε and CKIδ utilize ATP in a futile cycle of autophosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Stimuli that regulate the relevant phosphatases may regulate the activity of these kinases in the cell.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESRecombinant histidine tagged and untagged CKIε were produced in Escherichia coli as described (7Fish K.

Immunoblots were visualized with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Cell Treatments with Phosphatase InhibitorsNIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were plated in 35-mm round dishes and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. At 70% confluence, cells were treated with calyculin A or okadaic acid in Me2SO at indicated times and concentrations. Me2SO was added as control in equal amounts to all untreated cells. At the indicated times, the growth medium was removed, and the cells were lysed with 1× SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading sample buffer (10% glycerol, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 3% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue), boiled for 3 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE.

Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Mammalian Expression ConstructsThe protein coding sequences of CKIα2 and CKIε were cloned in frame directly downstream of the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) coding sequence, contained in pBluescript-HA (the generous gift of F. Brown and E. Leibold, University of Utah). The HA-tagged CKI open reading frames were subsequently excised with HindIII andXbaI and cloned into the same sites of pRcCMV (Invitrogen). The resulting constructs were pV367 (CMV-HA-CKIα2) and pV371 (CMV-HA-CKIε). Similar constructs, pV368 (CMV-HA-CKIα2K46A) and pV372 (CMV-HA-CKIεK38R), were generated using kinase-deficient point mutations of each isoform (7Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation studies, pV405 (4HA-CKIε) and pV406 (4HA-CKIεK38R) containing four copies of the HA epitope were constructed in pCEP4 (Invitrogen) (17McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S.

Cells at 50–90% confluence were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid DNA mixed with 6 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Transfection efficiencies were routinely 40–50% for COS-1 and 293 cells.Subcellular FractionationCOS-1 cells were lysed in hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg/μl−1 leupeptin, 1 μg/μl−1pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF) 48 h after transfection. Soluble material was clarified by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min. To the resulting supernatant, a 1/10 volume of 0.3 m Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.4 m KCl, and 30 mm MgCl2 was added, and the mixture was centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The resulting pellet was designated the membrane fraction and the supernatant was the cytoplasmic fraction. The pellet from the 1000 × gcentrifugation was extracted with high salt buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 μg/μl−1 leupeptin, 1 μg/μl−1pepstatin, and 1 mm PMSF. The pellet was mixed slowly at 4 °C for 30 min and then clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The resulting supernatant is referred to as the nuclear fraction.Metabolic LabelingTransiently transfected 293 cells were metabolically labeled for 5 h in 5% dialyzed calf serum (Life Sciences), 2 mCi ml−1H332PO4 (NEN Life Science Products), and phosphate-free DMEM (Life Sciences) starting at 36 h post-transfection. Calyculin A was not added or added to the transiently transfected cultures at a final concentration of 50 nm during the last 30 min of metabolic labeling. Cultures were harvested by lysis in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 1 μg/μl−1 leupeptin, 1 μg/μl−1pepstatin, 0.1 mm PMSF, 5 mmNa3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 250 nm okadaic acid, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate) and clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min. Soluble extracts containing HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with 12CA5 mAb and protein A-agarose and analzyed by SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel. Results were visualized by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics).RESULTSThe phosphorylation state of CKIε was initially assessed by following the shift in electrophoretic mobility of the kinase after SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1 A, recombinant autophosphorylated CKIε (lane 2) displays a marked decrease in electrophoretic mobility compared with PP2Ac-treated CKIε (lane 1). When log-phase 3T3 cells were lysed in SDS and the mobility of endogenous CKIε was examined by immunoblot analysis, we likewise found that the immunoreactive kinase was predominantly in the high mobility, dephosphorylated state (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and8).In a recent study, we demonstrated that in vitro purified CKIε is capable of rapid autophosphorylation, with a marked reduction in electrophoretic mobility within 5 min of the addition of ATP (10Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). How is CKIε maintained in the dephosphorylated state in vivo? Two potential mechanisms are, first, the kinase may be unable to autophosphorylate in vivo or, second, it may be dephosphorylated more rapidly than it autophosphorylates. To evaluate the second possibility, that there are cellular phosphatases that actively dephosphorylate CKIε, we treated 3T3 cells with the cell-permeable serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A and determined their effect on the phosphorylation state of the kinase. As shown in Fig. 1 A, lanes 3–13, treatment of cells with either okadaic acid or calyculin A leads to a dose-dependent change in CKIε electrophoretic mobility that reflects a change in phosphorylation. This effect was quite rapid; as seen in Fig. 1 B, lane 6, exposure of cells to 100 nm calyculin A for as little as 15 min led to a marked increase in kinase phosphorylation. Note, too, that the effect is not antibody-dependent since the immunoblot in Fig. 1 A was probed with anti-CKIε mAb directed against the carboxyl terminus of CKIε, and in Fig. 1 B, it was probed with UT31, a rabbit polyclonal antibody that recognizes the amino terminus of CKIε and CKIδ (10Cegielska A. Gietzen K.F. Rivers A. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1357-1364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). While the CKIε mAb may also recognize CKIδ, the two kinases appear regulated in a coordinate manner since all the immunoreactive kinase behaved similarly both in the absence and presence of phosphatase inhibitors.To address the question of whether the in vivodephosphorylation of the kinases was restricted to transformed, log-phase tissue culture cells or was a general phenomenon, the tissue expression pattern of CKI was first investigated (Fig. 2 A). Northern blot analysis indicates several forms of CKI, including CKIα, CKIδ, and CKIε mRNA, are widely and similarly expressed in all human tissues examined, with the highest levels in muscle and brain (Fig. 2 A). Protein extracts were then prepared from flash-frozen rat tissues and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. As seen in Fig. 2 B, CKIε in all rat tissues examined was predominantly in the high mobility, dephosphorylated form. Interestingly, the ratio of CKI mRNA to protein varies widely between tissue (e.g. compare the ratio of mRNA to immunoreactive protein in liver and heart), suggesting additional post-translational regulation. Trace amounts of lower mobility immunoreactive species were seen in several tissues after longer exposure times (data not shown), suggesting some turnover of more highly phosphorylated kinase. The results suggest CKIε dephosphorylation is a widespread phenomenon, and is not limited to tissue culture or transformed cells.Figure 2CKIε is a widely distributed nuclear and cytoplasmic kinase that is predominantly dephosphorylated in various tissues. A, human tissue expression patterns. A Northern blot of human RNA (CLONTECH) was probed sequentially with 32P-labeled β-actin and CKIε, CKIδ, and CKIα cDNAs (7Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). mRNA sizes are indicated in kilobases.B, immunoblot analysis of endogenous CKIε. 200 ng of recombinant CKIε (rCKIε) was dephosphorylated with 200 ng of PP2Ac (lane 1) or autophosphorylated in the presence of 4 mm ATP for 30 min at 37 °C (lane 2). The kinases and 25 μg each of protein extract from HeLa cells (lane 3) and the indicated rat tissues (lanes 4–8) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-CKIε monoclonal antibody. Recombinant CKIε samples were exposed to film for 20 s, and all other samples were exposed to film for 1 min. The closed circle indicates the position of phosphorylated CKIε, and the open circle indicates the position of dephosphorylated CKIε. Sizes are indicated in kilodaltons. C, CKIε is both nuclear and cytoplasmic. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with the indicated HA-tagged expression constructs or empty vector and separated into membrane (M), cytosol (C), and nuclear (N) fractions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal cell equivalents were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with 12CA5 mAb that recognizes the HA epitope. The positions of CKIα2 and CKIε are indicated by arrows; prominent 12CA5-cross-reacting bands are indicated by an *.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To determine whether CKI was dephosphorylated by nuclear or cytoplasmic phosphatases, the subcellular localization of CKIε (and as a control, CKIα2) was investigated. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with hemagglutinin epitope-tagged CKIα2 and CKIε expression constructs. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and membrane, soluble, and nuclear fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation as described (see “Experimental Procedures”). The pattern of cross-reacting material present in the fractions from untransfected cells (Fig. 2 C, lanes 1–3) confirms that the fractions contain distinct proteins. CKIα2 remained predominantly in the soluble fraction (Fig. 2 C, lanes 4–6), while high levels of CKIε were seen in membrane, soluble, and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2 C, lanes 7–9). A parallel experiment done with kinase-inactive forms of CKIα2 and CKIε showed an identical pattern of subcellular distribution (data not shown), suggesting that kinase activity is not required for CKIε nuclear localization.To further characterize the role of cellular phosphatases that catalyze the rapid turnover of phosphoryl groups on CKIε, the fate of the kinase in cell extracts was examined. As shown in Fig. 3, recombinant histidine-tagged CKIε fully autophosphorylates when incubated with ATP in the absence of cell extracts (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and 2). However, when the same amount of kinase is incubated with 25 μg of HeLa extract, a small increase in kinase mobility is seen (compare Fig. 3 A, lane 1 with lanes 3 and4), indicating removal of residual phosphoryl groups. If the protein phosphatases present in the HeLa extract are inhibited, then the added CKIε rapidly autophosphorylates. (Fig. 3 A,lane 5). Similarly, when HeLa extracts are incubated without added recombinant CKIε with or without ATP (Fig. 3 A,lanes 6–9), no change in endogenous CKIε electrophoretic mobility is seen unless protein phosphatase inhibitors are first added (compare Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 7 withlanes 8 and 9). Note that even in the absence of added ATP, sufficient ATP is present in the cell extract to permit autophosphorylation of endogenous CKIε once phosphatase inhibitors are added (Fig. 3 A, lane 8). The HeLa phosphatases are very efficient at removing phosphates from CKIε; Fig. 3 B demonstrates that when histidine-tagged CKIε, autophosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, is added back to HeLa extract then 50% of the 32P-labeled phosphate groups are removed in less than 1 min and 90% are removed by 10 min. Note that fully dephosphorylated histidine-tagged CKIε has an electrophoretic mobility of approximately 50 kDa and is not visible in the autoradiograph. This decrease in the 32P-labeled CKIε is due to dephosphorylation and not proteolysis, as incubation of CKIε in HeLa extract for as long as 30 min has no effect on protein levels (Fig. 3 A). This data is consistent with the hypothesis that casein kinase I ε autophosphorylation is ongoing bothin vivo and in extracts but is rapidly reversed in vivo and in cell extracts by okadaic acid and calyculin A-sensitive phosphatases.Figure 3Phosphatases in HeLa extract actively dephosphorylate CKIε. A, recombinant CKIε autophosphorylates in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors. In lanes 1–5, recombinant histidine-tagged CKIε (rCKIε, 200 ng) was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without the addition of 4 mm ATP (ATP); a phosphatase inhibitor mixture containing 100 nm calyculin A, 250 nm okadaic acid, and 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate (PP inhibitors); and/or 25 μg HeLa extract (HeLa extract), as indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with CKIε mAb. In lanes 6–9, reactions identical to those in lanes 1–5 were performed except that no recombinant CKIε was added, so only endogenous CKIε was detected. Note untagged CKIε (lanes 6–9) has a higher electrophoretic mobility than histidine-tagged CKIε (lanes 1–5). B, CKIε is rapidly dephosphorylated by HeLa phosphatases. Histidine-tagged CKIε was autophosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and then incubated with 25 μg of HeLa extract for the indicated number of minutes (0, 1, 3, 5, or 10;lanes 1–5). Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography (autorad).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In order to confirm that CKIε phosphorylation in cells and extracts is indeed due to an intramolecular reaction, rather than phosphorylation in trans by other forms of CKI or other cellular kinases, recombinant wild-type CKIε or a kinase-inactive CKIε mutant (K38R) (7Fish K. Cegielska A. Getman M. Landes G. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14875-14883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) was incubated with HeLa extract, and its phosphorylation state was assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4). While wild-type CKIε readily autophosphorylated Fig. 4, lanes 1–4), the kinase-deficient mutant K38R showed no change in electrophoretic mobility despite a 30-min incubation in the presence of ATP and phosphatase inhibitors (lanes 5–8). This result strongly suggests that CKIε phosphorylation is due to intramolecular autophosphorylation. To confirm this result in vivo, a hemagglutinin-tagged kinase-dead CKIε was transiently expressed in 3T3 cells. No change in electrophoretic mobility (i.e. no significant phosphorylation) of the kinase-dead CKIε occurred even after treatment of the transfected cells with calyculin A (data not shown). These results demonstrate that CKIε autophosphorylates in an intramolecular manner, and additionally suggests that no other cellular kinases present in HeLa extracts phosphorylate CKIε in a manner that contributes to changes in electrophoretic mobility.Figure 4Phosphorylation of CKIε is intramolecular. Recombinant histidine-tagged wild type (WT) or kinase inactive (K38R) CKIε (200 ng) was incubated with 25 μg of HeLa extract in the presence or absence of 4 mm ATP and phosphatase inhibitors (PP inhibitors; 100 nm calyculin A, 250 nmokadaic acid, and 50 mm β-glycerol phosphate) as indicated, for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with CKIε mAb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Two closely related forms of CKI have been identified in mammals: CKIε and CKIδ. These kinases differ by only eight residues in the kinase domain and are about 53% identical over the 124-amino acid carboxyl-terminal regulatory domain. Since the monoclonal antibody directed against the CKIε tail cross-reacts with CKIδ, it was important to examine whether CKIδ was specifically maintained in a high mobility, dephosphorylated state in vivo. 3T3 cells were therefore treated with calyculin A or okadaic acid, and cellular extracts were probed with monoclonal antibodies against CKIε and CKIδ. As shown in Fig. 5, CKIδ showed a similar marked decrease in electrophoretic mobility upon phosphatase inhibitor treatment. Interestingly, CKIδ displayed a more rapidly and uniform change in electrophoretic mobility, while CKIε appeared to decrease in intensity. While this decrease in CKIε immunoreactivity could be due to phosphorylation-regulated proteolysis, we found no change in signal intensity when cells were pretreated with proteosome or other protease inhibitors (data not shown). The fact that the two antibodies gave similar but not identical results supports the conclusion that the CKIε mAb is relatively specific for CKIε.Figure 5The related kinase, CKIδ, undergoes a similar mobility shift in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors.3T3 cells were treated with 50 nm calyculin A, 1 μm okadaic acid or mock-treated (untrt) for the indicated duration and then lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-CKIδ monoclonal antibody 128A (top panel) or the anti-CKIε monoclonal antibody (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONPhosphorylation is a common mode of kinase regulation, acting to both positively and negatively modulate enzyme activity.

We have found, by using sucrose density centrifugation, that the resulting preparation consisted of a mixture of dimeric and monomeric forms of the CP47 reaction center (RC) complex, having molecular masses of 410 ± 30 and 200 ± 28 kDa, respectively, as estimated by size exclusion chromatography. The level of the dimer in the preparation is significantly higher than the monomeric form. Both the monomer and dimer contain the proteins CP47, D1, and D2 and the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b 559. Analyses by mass spectrometry and N-terminal sequencing showed that both forms of the CP47-RC complex contain the products of the psbI,psbT c (chloroplast gene), and psbWwith molecular masses of 4195.5, 3849.6, and 5927.4 Da, respectively. In contrast to the monomeric form, the CP47-RC dimer contained two extra proteins with low molecular weights, identified as the products of the psbL and psbK genes having molecular masses of 4365.5 and 4292.1, respectively. It was also found that the dimer contained slightly more molecules of chlorophyll a(21 ± 2.5) than the monomer (18 ± 1.5), a characteristic also observed in the room temperature absorption spectrum by comparing the ratio of absorption at 416 and 435 nm. Of particular note was the finding that the dimer, but not the monomer, contained plastoquinone-9 (estimated to be 1.5 ± 0.3 molecules per RC). The results indicate that the CP47-RC monomer is derived from the dimeric form of the complex, and therefore the latter is likely to represent anin vivo conformation. The PsbTc as well as the PsbI and PsbW proteins are identified as being intimately associated with the D1 and D2 proteins, and in the case of the dimer, importance is placed on the PsbL and PsbK proteins in sustaining plastoquinone binding and maintenance of the dimeric organization. Assuming only one copy of the α- and β-subunits of cytochromeb 559, the monomeric and dimeric forms of the complex would be expected to contain 21 and 23 × 2 transmembrane helices, respectively.

The light-induced splitting of water and the consequential release of dioxygen is a fundamental reaction in photosynthesis taking place in all higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.

The PSII complex is composed of at least 25 different proteins and binds a large number of pigments (1Barber J. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology. 6. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 115-162Google Scholar). At the heart of this complex is the reaction center (RC), consisting of the D1 and D2 proteins, where primary charge separation occurs (2Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Closely associated with the D1 and D2 heterodimer are the two chlorophyll a-binding proteins, CP47 and CP43, and a range of small hydrophobic polypeptides including the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b 559. CP47 and CP43 act both as an “inner” light harvesting system and as a conduit for the transfer of energy captured by an “outer” light harvesting system composed either of proteins that bind chlorophyll aand b (in the case of higher plants and green algae) or phycobilisomes (in the case of cyanobacteria and red algae) (3Bricker T.M. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 24: 1-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The outer antennae can be removed during isolation procedures to obtain a “core” preparation consisting of CP47, CP43, D1, and D2 proteins and other polypeptides including those that are extrinsically bound to the luminal surface and required for stabilizing and optimizing the water splitting system and its catalytic cluster of manganese atoms (4Hankamer B.

Further solubilization of PSII to produce a “CP47-RC subcore” results in the loss of water splitting activity, in part due to the removal of extrinsic proteins and the manganese cluster but may also be due to the stripping away of CP43 (5Ghanotakis D.F. de Paula J.C.

This particle, which is dimeric, contains the PSII core and a complement of chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (LHCII (Lhcb1 and -2), CP29 (Lhcb6), and CP26 (Lhcb5)), totaling about 100 chlorophyll molecules/RC (7Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Since this LHCII-PSII supercomplex is isolated using a mild detergent treatment and maintains high oxygen evolving activity, it seems highly likely that it represents anin vivo form of PSII (7Hankamer B.

Indeed the dimeric form of the PSII core complex isolated from spinach is more functionally active and stable than the monomeric form (7Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).A PSII structure that has recently been revealed to 8-Å resolution is that of the CP47-RC subcore complex (9Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-527Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This structure has been obtained by two-dimensional crystallization and cryoelectron microscopy, and the published work was in the form of a projection map. By comparison with x-ray crystallography data of the reaction center of purple bacteria and of photosystem one, it was possible to suggest that some density in the map was due to the transmembrane helices of the D1 and D2 proteins and CP47, while the remaining density results from other proteins present. It was also found that the unit cell in the two-dimensional crystals contained two dimers of the CP47-RC complex and that the size of the dimer was compatible with a central location in the LHCII·PSII supercomplex (9Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-527Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar).In order to complement the structural analyses of the two-dimensional crystals of CP47-RC, we have undertaken studies to determine the composition and properties of the isolated solubilized CP47-RC complex.MATERIALS AND METHODSIsolation of CP47-RC ComplexsCP47-RC complexes were obtained from BBY-type PSII-enriched membranes isolated from market spinach with modifications described by Hankamer and co-workers (6Boekema D.J. Hankamer B. Bald D. Kruip J. Nield J. Boonstra A.F. Barber J. Rögner M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). After washing with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 9.0), 1 mg of Chl ml−1 of BBYs were solubilized with n-dodecyl β- d-maltoside (DM; 1% final concentration) and heptyl thioglycopyranoside (HTG; 2.7% final concentration) in the dark with constant stirring for 30 min at room temperature. The nonsolubilized material was removed by a 30-min centrifugation at 40,000 × g at 4 °C. For purification the solubilized BBYs were loaded onto a Fractogel ion exchange column (DEAE-Toyopearl 650S, TSK) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 10 mm NaCl, and 2 mm DM. The sample was washed with 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.3), 2 mm DM, and 40 mm NaCl and was eluted with the same buffer but using a 40–200 mm NaCl gradient. The ion exchange chromatography was carried out at 4 °C under dim light conditions.Isolation of Monomeric and Dimeric CP47-RC ComplexesMonomeric and dimeric CP47-RC complexes were separated using sucrose gradient centrifugation. The sucrose gradient mix solution consisted of 25 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 0.5 msucrose, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.03% DM. The sucrose density gradients were prepared after freezing at −20 °C and slow thawing at 4 °C. The ion exchange chromatography-purified CP47-RC complex (300 μg of Chl) was loaded onto the gradients and centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C in a Beckman SW41 swing out rotor and separated into two different fractions.Room Temperature Absorption SpectraThese were measured using an SLM Aminco (Urbana, IL) model DW2000 spectrophotometer.HPLC Size Exclusion AnalysisHPLC size exclusion analysis was carried out using a Zorbax GF-450 column 9.4/250-mm (Jones Chromatography). The mobile phase consisted of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.03% DM, 0.3 m sucrose and was passed through the column at a rate of 0.5 ml min−1. The 20-μl samples injected contained 5 μg of Chl, and the profiles were monitored at 418 nm. The molecular weights of the complexes were determined by using a gel filtration calibration kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).SDS-PAGE and Western BlottingThe polypeptide compositions of the isolated PSII preparations were analyzed by gradient SDS-PAGE (10–17% polyacrylamide) containing 6 m urea, essentially using the method of Laemmli (10Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.The protein profiles resolved by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose (11Dunn S.D. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) and immunolabeled with CP47- or CP43-specific antibodies raised against electrophoretically purified spinach CP47, CP43, D2 (a kind gift from Dr. R. Barbato), or C-terminal D1-specific antibody (Dupont 304) raised against a synthetic polypeptide, homologous to the 29 amino acids of the C-terminal pea D1 precursor (a kind gift from Dr. P. Nixon). Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG was used as a secondary antibody and was labeled with Extravidine-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Sigma). The chromogenic substrates were 5-bromo-4-chloroindolyl phosphate ρ-toluidine salt and nitro blue tetrazolium chloride.Reverse Phase HPLC Pigment AnalysisPigment AnalysisPigments (chlorophyll a, pheophytin a, and β-carotene) were extracted into 80% (v/v) acetone/H2O at 4 °C in dim light conditions. The samples were vortexed for 30 s, centrifuged for 2 min in a microcentrifuge in order to separate out proteinaceous materials, and filtered through a 0.2-μm (pore size) membrane (polyvinylidene difluoride; Vatman) before injection (injection volume was 20 μl). The pigments were resolved using an ODS-1 Spherisorb column (Anachem) and isocratic elution with methanol/ethyl acetate/water 68:30:2 (v/v/v), at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. We used a variable wavelength detector (Kontron 30), detecting simultaneously at 663 nm (for Chla and Pheo a) and 453 nm (for β-carotene) or 255 nm (for PQ). Chl a and β-carotene quantification was performed after calibration of the corresponding peaks with pigment standards (purchased from Sigma), whose concentrations were determined using extinction coefficients 76.79 mm−1cm−1 at 663.6 nm in 80% acetone for Chla (12Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedmann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4580) Google Scholar) and 139 mm−1cm−1 at 452 nm in 100% hexane for β-carotene (13Zechmeister L. Polgar A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1943; 65: 1522-1528Crossref Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Pheo a standard used for calibration was produced by acidifying the Chl a standard with 2 mm HCl (14Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Barber J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15074-15079Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). PQ-9 (obtained from Sigma) was dissolved in 100% ethanol, and its concentration was determined using the extinction coefficient of 15.2 m−1 cm−1 at 255 nm (15Redfearn E.R. Friend J. Phytochemistry. 1962; 1: 147-151Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar).Separation of ProteinsPartial separation of the protein subunits in the CP47-RC monomer and dimer complexes was carried out for subsequent mass spectrometric measurements and was achieved using a Spherisorb Aquapore RP-300 (220 × 4.6-mm) column fitted to a Kontron HPLC system (Datasystem 450, HPLC pump 420, detector 430 and mixer M800). The PSII preparations were dialyzed against 2 × 2.0 liters of aqueous 5% acetic acid at 4 °C for 16–24 h and were loaded directly onto the column. The components were eluted with a solvent system of A (aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and B (90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), using a linear gradient from 100% A to 40% B in 10 min followed by an increase to 100% B over 60 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml min−1. Elution was monitored at 214 and 280 nm, and fractions were collected at 1-min intervals.Gas Phase Edman SequencingPeptides were Edman-degraded using a CI 4000 gas phase protein sequencer, and the standard protein sequencing method was used (16Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Samples that failed to give sequence information were treated on the glass fiber disc with 0.6 n HCl at 25 °C for 24 h.Electrospray Mass Spectrometry AnalysisIntact proteins of the CP47-RC complexes and their digestion products were also analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Spectra were obtained by direct injection of 10-μl aliquots of HPLC-purified proteins into the ion source of a VG Bio-Q triple quadrupole electrospray mass spectrometer. The instrument was operated using a carrier flow buffer of 90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, propan-1-ol and 2-methoxyethanol in a 1:1:1:1 (v/v/v/v) ratio at a flow rate of 5 μl min−1. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using a solution of horse heart myoglobin (1 pm ml−1) to give an average chemical molecular mass for the signals observed.Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry AnalysisMatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectra were acquired using a Fisons VG ZAB 2SE 2FPD mass spectrometer, fitted with a UV laser (337 nm). The instrument was calibrated using CsI clusters. Data acquisition and processing were performed using VG Analytical Opus software. The samples were dissolved in 60% propan-1-ol in 5% aqueous acetic acid, and 1-μl aliquots were loaded onto a probe that had been treated with a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid made up in a 70:30 (v/v) solution of 90% acetonitrile in aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and aqueous 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, respectively.DISCUSSIONThe results presented here show that CP43 is more readily removed from the PSII core than CP47 despite the fact that both proteins are likely to be structurally rather similar based on the homologies between their amino acid sequences (3Bricker T.M. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 24: 1-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Of particular importance is that we have discovered by our isolation procedure that the resulting CP47-RC complex is mainly in a dimeric state with a molecular mass estimated to be 410 ± 30 kDa. We present several lines of evidence that the monomeric form of the complex is derived by dissociation of the dimer. This dissociation gives rise to the loss of PsbL and PsbK proteins and some chlorophyll. Of particular note is that the dimer to monomer conversion also results in the loss of bound plastoquinone-9.The fact that the CP47-RC dimer was significantly more abundant than the monomeric form in our preparation, contained more protein subunits, and bound plastoquinone suggests that it represents a more native form of the complex. This conclusion is consistent with the finding that the largest and functionally most active forms of isolated PSII from spinach are dimeric (7Hankamer B. Nield J. Zheleva D. Boekema E.J. Jansson S. Barber J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Moreover, the most up to date mapping of subunit positioning within PSII places CP43 toward the outer side of the central core dimer (4Hankamer B. Barber J. Boekema E.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 8Morris E.P. Hankamer B. Zheleva D. Friso G. Barber J. Structure. 1997; 5: 837-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, its removal need not disturb the dimeric subcore complex composed of CP47-RC. It is noteworthy that a dimeric organization of CP47-RC was also observed in two-dimensional crystals, which have been analyzed recently by electron microscopy to 8 Å (9Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-527Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar).We have shown by a combination of reverse phase HPLC, mass spectrometry, and N-terminal sequencing that the monomeric and dimeric forms of CP47-RC contain a number of small polypeptides in addition to CP47 and the D1 and D2 proteins. Present in both forms of the complex are the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b 559and proteins that are the products of the psbI,psbT c, and psbW genes. The presence of cytochrome b 559 polypeptides and the PsbI protein is expected, given that these subunits occur in the isolated reaction center complex, which is depleted of CP47 (16Sharma J. Panico M. Barber J. Morris H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3935-3943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y.

That PsbW would be present is also expected based on the work of Schroeder and colleagues (19Lorkovic Z.J. Schroeder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmuller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Irrgang K.D. Shi L.-X. Funk C. Schroeder W.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17588-17593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This is a nuclear encoded gene not found in the genome of Synechocystis 6803. ThepsbT c gene is located on the same operon as thepsbB gene (which encodes CP47) in the chloroplast genome. It had previously been known as the ycf8 gene, and its identification as a PSII gene has only recently been made using antibodies raised against its product (27Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2747-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we confirm that this protein is indeed a PSII component and further show that it is in the CP47-RC complex and therefore located close to the D1-D2 heterodimer.The fact that the dimer also contains the products of thepsbL and psbK genes but that the monomer does not could be important for explaining the difference in their ability to bind functionally active plastoquinone as well as accounting for the slightly higher chlorophyll content. It has previously been argued that PsbL is involved in the functioning of QA, possibly by stabilizing its binding to the D2 protein (28Nagatsuka T. Fukuhara S. Akabori K. Toyoshima Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 223-231Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In terms of the recent structural analysis of the CP47-RC complex (9Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-527Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), it is possible to estimate the number of transmembrane helices likely to be present. Assuming only one copy of the α- and β-subunits of cytochromeb 559 (29Miyazaki A. Shina T. Toyoshima Y. Gounaris K. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 933: 423-431Google Scholar) and given that the small subunits, PsbI, PsbTc, PsbW, PsbK, and PsbL, are all predicted to have one transmembrane helix, the monomer would contain 21 transmembrane helices and the dimer would contain 23. These numbers rely on the likelihood that the D1-D2 heterodimer and CP47 contain 10 and 6 transmembrane helices, respectively (1Barber J. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology. 6. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 115-162Google Scholar, 4Hankamer B. Barber J. Boekema E.J. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Mol. Biol. 1997; 48: 641-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). If there are two copies of the cytochrome b 559 subunits as some advocate (30Lam E. Baltimore B. Ortiz W. Chollar S. Melis A. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 724: 201-211Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), then the total number of membrane-spanning segments would be 23 for the monomer and 25 for the dimer. In the two-dimensional crystals of CP47-RC recently analyzed to 8 Å by electron crystallography (9Rhee K.-H. Morris E.P Zheleva D. Hankamer B. Kühlbrandt W. Barber J. Nature. 1997; 389: 522-527Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar), the complex seems to be dimeric within the unit cell. Whether the dimer in the crystal is identical to that studied here is not certain, but if it is then the projection map obtained for the CP47-RC complex would be expected to contain at least 23 transmembrane helices. The light-induced splitting of water and the consequential release of dioxygen is a fundamental reaction in photosynthesis taking place in all higher plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. This reaction is catalyzed by a complex known as photosystem II (PSII) 1The abbreviations and protein names used are: PSII, photosystem II; RC, reaction center; CP47, chlorophyll-binding protein encoded by psbB gene; CP43, chlorophyll-binding protein encoded by psbC gene; D1 and D2 proteins, products of the psbA and psbD genes, respectively; DM,n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside; HTG, heptyl thioglycopyranoside; QA, the first PSII plastoquinone electron acceptor; QX and QY, optical absorptions with their transitions approximately parallel to thex and y axes of the chromophore; LHCII, light-harvesting complex of PSII; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Chl, chlorophyll; Pheo, pheophytin; BBY, membrane fraction enriched in PSII and isolated according to Ref. 32Berthold D.A.

The PSII complex is composed of at least 25 different proteins and binds a large number of pigments (1Barber J. Miflin B.J. Oxford Surveys of Plant Molecular and Cellular Biology. 6. Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 115-162Google Scholar). At the heart of this complex is the reaction center (RC), consisting of the D1 and D2 proteins, where primary charge separation occurs (2Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Closely associated with the D1 and D2 heterodimer are the two chlorophyll a-binding proteins, CP47 and CP43, and a range of small hydrophobic polypeptides including the α- and β-subunits of cytochrome b 559. CP47 and CP43 act both as an “inner” light harvesting system and as a conduit for the transfer of energy captured by an “outer” light harvesting system composed either of proteins that bind chlorophyll aand"
https://openalex.org/W2085384499,"The components of the antigen processing machinery, low molecular mass polypeptide (LMP) 2 and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) 1, are encoded by closely linked genes within the major histocompatibility complex class II subregion. Although the two genes share a bi-directional promoter, LMP2 and TAP1 have differential cellular expression. TAP1 is expressed constitutively. However, LMP2 expression requires induction by interferon-gamma in most cells. The regulatory elements within the LMP2/TAP1 promoter and the transcription factors that bind these elements have been defined. However, how these transactivators regulate differential TAP1 and LMP2 gene transcription is not known. We have addressed this question by analyzing three human melanoma cell lines with distinct phenotypes of LMP2 and TAP1 expression. Whereas binding of either interferon regulatory factor 1 or Stat1 to the overlapping interferon consensus sequence-2/GAS is sufficient for regulating transcription of the TAP1 gene, binding of both factors is required for LMP2 gene transcription. This conclusion is supported by restoration of LMP2 gene transcription following transfection of wild type Stat1alpha or interferon regulatory factor 1 cDNA into cells lacking these transcription factors. The flexibility in the regulation of the TAP1 gene may reflect its role in maintaining immune surveillance. Furthermore, lack of LMP2 gene transcription in quiescent human cells suggests that LMP2 expression reflects a state of cell activation."

In excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle, all of the Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptor isoform 1 (RyR1). This macroscopic phenomenology is referred to as “depolarization-induced Ca2+ release,” as Ca2+ release from internal stores is triggered by T tubule membrane depolarization to be contrasted with “Ca2+-induced calcium release” in heart. In the cardiomyocyte, extracellular Ca2+ must first enter via voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, which in turn activates the ryanodine receptor isoform 2 (RyR2) to release most of the Ca2+ for cell signaling. Purified RyR1 and RyR2 are available in substantial quantity, which has permitted their detailed characterization. The RyRs have a mass of 2.3 million and are the largest channel structures known. Recently, FK506-binding protein 12 (FKBP12) has been found to be associated with the RyR1 in a stoichiometry of 4. RyR1 is a hetero-oligomer with the structural formula (RyR1 protomer)4(FKBP12)4. The cardiac RyR2 receptor is likewise associated with four FKBPs, albeit with a different isoform, FKBP12.6 (10Timerman A.P. Jayaraman T. Wiederrecht G. Onoue H. Marks A.R. Fleischer S. Biochem.

The receptors have 4-fold symmetry consistent with their subunit stoichiometry. It is now known that the ICRCs are widely distributed in tissues and that the three RyR isoforms are found in a diversity of tissues including the nervous system, epithelia, and smooth muscle (16Giannini G.

Skeletal muscles from non-mammalian vertebrates, i.e.chicken, frog, and fish, have two ryanodine receptor isoforms, referred to as α and β isoforms (24Airey J.A. Beck C.F. Murakami K. Tanksley S.J.

The use of cloning technology has revolutionized our approach to the study of membrane proteins, especially channels. Indeed, RyR3 was first described and the sequence was deduced from the cDNA (7Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) without having been isolated. However powerful the cloning technology, the primary structural and functional characterization of receptor proteins still requires their isolation and characterization. This study describes the isolation and characterization of RyR3 from bovine diaphragm SR. A preliminary report has appeared (29Jeyakumar L.H. Copello J.A. O'Malley A. Wu G. Fleischer S. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 58AGoogle Scholar). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin was obtained from Calbiochem. Sulfo-m-maleimidobenzyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester was from Pierce. Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Ryanodine was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Reagents for Western blot development were obtained as follows: goat anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate was from Rockland (Gilbertsville, PA); nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color development reagents were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI); Immobilon-P transfer membrane was from Millipore (Bedford, MA); sodium dodecyl sulfate, acrylamide, methylene bis-acrylamide, and SDS-PAGE prestained molecular weight markers were from Bio-Rad. Phospholipids were obtained from Avanti (Alabaster, WI). Immobilized protein A-Sepharose matrix was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Sweden); and immobilized protein G matrix was from Pierce. All the other reagents were obtained from Sigma or were reagent grade. The protein concentration of SR fractions was estimated by the method of Lowry (30Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS-PAGE was performed with a mini-slab gel apparatus (Hoeffer Scientific) using the buffer system described by Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Thick (1.5 mm) slab gels (5.0% resolving gel) were used for SDS-PAGE, and the samples were treated with sample loading buffer at room temperature for about 30 min. Polyclonal antibody against ryanodine receptor 3 (RyR3) was raised in rabbits using the synthetic peptide corresponding to the deduced amino acid sequences, 4326–4336 (11 amino acids) of rabbit RyR3 (7Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The epitope peptide with a cysteine residue added at the C terminus was linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, using the bifunctional agent, sulfo-m-maleimidobenzyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester. The general RyR antibody (number 8) was generated in rabbits using a peptide sequence that is conserved in each of the RyR isoforms (32Lesh R.E. Marks A.R. Somlyo A.V. Fleischer S. Somlyo A.P. Circ. Res. 1993; 72: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The synthetic peptide consisting of 20 amino acid residues with a cysteine residue added at the N terminus corresponds to 4681–4700 of RyR1 (7Hakamata Y. Nakai J. Takeshima H. Imoto K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 312: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 33Takeshima H. Nishimura S. Matsumoto T. Ishida H. Kangawa K. Minamino N. Matsuo H. Ueda M. Hanaoka M. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1989; 339: 439-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). The immunizing dose of the epitope was 500 μg/rabbit (weighing about 8 pounds). The primary and booster doses were injected at 1-month intervals, with Freund's complete and incomplete adjuvants, respectively. Subcutaneous injections at the back of the neck and intramuscular injections in the back and thigh muscles were given for primary and booster doses, and blood was collected 10–11 days following each booster dose. Sequence-specific polyclonal antibody was purified from the antiserum using an affinity matrix, prepared by conjugating the peptide epitope to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose B (34Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies, A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-315Google Scholar). SR fractions were prepared from bovine diaphragm muscle by the procedure of Saito et al. (35Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) as described for rabbit skeletal muscle TC, with the modification that the buffer conditions of Chamberlain et al. (36Chamberlain B.K. Levitsky D.O. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used. The supernatants from blendings 1 and 2 give rise to the I and R series of fractions (Table I). All the buffers used in the preparations contained the protease inhibitors, leupeptin (1.0 μg/ml), aprotinin (1.0 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (40 μm). The SR fractions were resuspended in a small volume of resuspension buffer, quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C.Table ICharacteristics of subfractions from bovine diaphragm SRGradient fractionTotal proteinRyanodine binding,aBinding was determined at 70 nmryanodine. specific activityRyanodine binding, total activitymg/fractionpmol/mg proteinpmol/fractionR126.3 ± 7.130.17 ± 0.102.87 ± 1.71R249.4 ± 7.930.18 ± 0.5652.7 ± 42.50R385.8 ± 8.412.35 ± 0.60193.0 ± 36.82R477.5 ± 10.6910.7 ± 0.55813.3 ± 72.89I137.4 ± 5.370.67 ± 0.3027.2 ± 15.59I297.5 ± 18.550.89 ± 0.3478.7 ± 27.95I3161.9 ± 16.532.97 ± 0.45480.5 ± 78.88I483.2 ± 10.149.73 ± 1.10785.2 ± 84.65Bovine diaphragm sarcoplasmic reticulum was prepared from 600 g of ground diaphragm muscle as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subfractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on a step gradient (27, 32, 38, and 45% sucrose (w/w)) as for rabbit skeletal muscle SR (35Saito A.

Open table in a new tab Bovine diaphragm sarcoplasmic reticulum was prepared from 600 g of ground diaphragm muscle as described under “Experimental Procedures” and subfractionated by isopycnic centrifugation on a step gradient (27, 32, 38, and 45% sucrose (w/w)) as for rabbit skeletal muscle SR (35Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The terminal cisternae fraction (R4 and I4) were most enriched in RyR, similar to the TC from rabbit skeletal muscle. The data are presented as mean ± S.E. (n = 4). Microsomes from fresh rabbit diaphragms were prepared using muscle/buffer ratio (1 g, 5 ml) as used for bovine diaphragm SR. A Polytron device was used for homogenization, first at low speed setting for 15 s, then at speed setting 6 for 60 s, and for a third time at setting 6 for 15 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was filtered through four layers of cheesecloth. The pellet was rehomogenized twice at speed setting 6 for 30 s and processed like the first supernatant. The I and the R series microsomal pellets were obtained from the first and second supernatants after they were sedimented at 150,000 × g for 1 h. The immunoreactivities of bovine diaphragm terminal cisternae and the rabbit diaphragm microsomes were probed with both the general RyR (number 8) and RyR3-specific antiserum, respectively (1:1000). Specificity of RyR3 antibody was demonstrated by Western blot analysis, using TC of rabbit fast twitch skeletal muscle (35Saito A. Seiler S. Chu A. Fleischer S. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), canine cardiac microsomes (36Chamberlain B.K. Levitsky D.O. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 6602-6609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and bovine diaphragm terminal cisternae of SR (R4 and/or I4 fractions). Selective immunoprecipitation and quantitative estimation of RyR3 in bovine diaphragm TC was carried out in order to confirm that the RyR3-specific antibody is an immunoprecipitating antibody. Bovine diaphragm TC is enriched in ryanodine receptors and mainly contains RyR1 and some RyR3 (<5%). The RyR-enriched TC fraction, 6.0 mg/ml, was solubilized with CHAPS buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1.0 m NaCl, 2.0 mm DTT, and 0.5% CHAPS) at 4 °C for 90 min with gentle mixing. The mixture was then centrifuged at 50,000 × gfor 30 min to remove insoluble material. The supernatant was diluted 4-fold with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, and incubated with protein A-Sepharose matrix (20-μl bed volume) for 30 min at 4 °C to remove nonspecific binding components. The protein A-Sepharose was equilibrated with preequilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.125% CHAPS) for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing prior to its use. The supernatant obtained after sedimenting the protein A matrix at low speed was transferred to another container for overnight immunoadsorption with RyR3-specific antiserum (40 μl), at 4 °C with gentle mixing. Then, preequilibrated protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) was added, and incubation was continued for another 4 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The protein A matrix was then sedimented at low speed. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed five times with preequilibration buffer. After washing, the pellet was solubilized in an equal volume of 2× Laemmli sample loading buffer with boiling for about 5 min. The immunoprecipitate, the starting material, and the supernatant from immunoadsorption were characterized by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using RyR3-specific antiserum (Fig. 2 A). Immunoprecipitation of RyR3 was characterized by titration with increasing amounts of RyR3 antibody prebound to immobilized protein A/G. After immunoprecipitation of RyR3, sedimentation, and sequential washing as described under purification of RyR3 (see below), the immune complex was analyzed directly for ryanodine binding. Affinity purified RyR3-specific antibody was prebound to immobilized protein A/G matrix by incubating for 30 min at room temperature with gentle mixing. About 400 μg of antibody was admixed with protein A or G matrix (about 200-μl packed bed volume). RyR-enriched bovine diaphragm TC fractions (R4 and/or I4) were used as source for the purification of RyR3. The bovine diaphragm TC (∼100 mg of protein) was solubilized at 6.0 mg/ml in buffer A (20 mm Na2PIPES, pH 7.2, 0.6m NaCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 5.0 mm Na2AMP, 2.0 mm DTT, and 0.6% CHAPS (w/v), 0.3% SBL) for 90 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing. The mixture was then centrifuged at 50,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. The solubilized bovine diaphragm TC supernatant was diluted 4-fold with dilution buffer (buffer B) containing 20 mmNa2PIPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 5.0 mmNa2AMP, 2.0 mm DTT, and 0.3 msucrose. The mixture was then preabsorbed with 50 μl of preequilibrated protein A/G matrix for 15 min at 4 °C with gentle mixing to remove nonspecific binding components. After sedimenting to remove the matrix at low speed in the cold, the supernatant was transferred to another container, and RyR3 was selectively immunoadsorbed by incubating, with gentle mixing for 4 h at 4 °C, with the appropriate amount of prebound-RyR3 specific antibody, prebound to protein A/G matrix. The prebound RyR3 antibody-protein A/G matrix was preequilibrated with buffer B (containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.15% CHAPS, 0.075% SBL) for 30 min at 4 °C before addition to the solubilized and diluted bovine diaphragm SR. The amount of antibody matrix used to bind RyR3 was determined by the ryanodine binding activity of the bovine diaphragm TC fraction. A 3–4-fold excess of antibody/total RyR binding equivalents was used. The immune complex containing the RyR3 was then sedimented at low speed, and the supernatant was used to purify RyR1 by heparin-agarose column chromatography. The immune complex was washed sequentially, first with buffer B containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.25% SBL, second with buffer B containing 0.5m NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.25 SBL, and third with buffer B containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, and 0.25% SBL. The elution of the RyR3 was carried out with buffer B containing 0.4m NaCl, 0.6% CHAPS, 0.3% SBL, and excess of RyR3 epitope peptide (1.0 mg/ml). The eluate was collected, and the pellet was again washed with elution buffer without epitope peptide (post-eluate). The eluate and post-eluate were quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. RyR1 from the supernatant after RyR3 immunoprecipitation was partially purified using a heparin-agarose column essentially as described for RyR2 (9Inui M. Saito A. Fleischer S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15637-15642Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Buffer B (fortified additionally with 0.1 m NaCl and 0.15% CHAPS, 0.075% SBL) was used for preequilibration, and the linear gradient (0.1 m-0.8 m NaCl) elution buffer B also containing 0.5% CHAPS, 0.25% SBL. Fractions (3.0 ml each) were collected, and the ryanodine binding assay was carried out on 10-μl aliquots of the fractions. The RyR1 fractions were quick-frozen and stored at −80 °C. All the buffers used in the purification procedure contained the protease inhibitors, leupeptin (5 μg/ml) and aprotinin (5 μg/ml). Bovine diaphragm SR fractions enriched in terminal cisternae and column fractions from the immunoaffinity chromatography were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. For Western blot analysis after SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane for 1 h at 24 mA constant current in blot transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mmglycine, 1.3 mm SDS, pH 9.2) using Trans-Blot SD Semi-Dry Electrophoretic Transfer Cell (Bio-Rad). The vacant binding sites on the membrane were blocked by incubating the membrane in wash buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 0.55 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) containing 5% non-fat dry milk protein for 1 h. The membrane was probed with the RyR3-specific antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h, washed three times with wash buffer, and then incubated with secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase in blocking buffer. The membrane was again washed three times with wash buffer and developed with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate substrates. Small quantities of protein such as purified receptor were determined by scanning densitometry. Digital images of gels were obtained with a HP 6100P scanner (Hewlett-Packard), and Visioneer PaperPort 3.0.1 software (Visioneer Communications, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Densitometry was carried out using the DNA ProScan A13 software (Technology Resources, Nashville, TN) on the RyR1 and RyR3 bands after separation in 7.5% resolving gel (SDS-PAGE) and staining with Coomassie Blue. Bovine serum albumin was used for protein calibration. Routine ryanodine binding was determined at 70 nm ryanodine. Ryanodine binding to particulate fractions made use of sedimentation to separate bound from free ryanodine as described previously, or for solubilized fractions by polyethylene glycol precipitation with equine gamma globulin as carrier protein (37McGrew S.G.

High affinity ryanodine binding parameters were measured by ryanodine binding isotherms using [3H]ryanodine (∼15,000 cpm/pmol, obtained from NEN Life Science Products). Radioactivity was measured in a Beckman LS 5000TD scintillation counter. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of 20 μm cold ryanodine. Data of the binding isotherms were analyzed by Sigmaplot 2.0 (Jandel Scientific, Corte Madera, CA). Planar lipid bilayers were painted with a 5:4:1 mixture of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (50 mg/ml in decane) over 100–180-μm holes in Teflon septa, which separated two 1-ml compartments (termedcis and trans). The experimental system was described previously in detail (39Schindler H. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 171: 225-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 40Barg S. Copello J. Fleischer S. Am. J.

Most measurements were made using calcium as charge carrier (250 mm HEPES, 125 mm Tris, pH 7.4, cis; 250 mm HEPES, 53 mm Ca(OH)2, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.4,trans). For some experiments, the cis compartment or both hemi-chambers were filled with 250 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, 0.5 mmCaCl2. For fusion of purified RyR3 to the bilayer, solubilized RyR3 (1–4 μl) was added to the cis chamber while stirring. Fusion of channels was detected by the occurrence of Ca2+ or K+ currents. [Ca2+]free was adjusted using 1 mm1,2-bis(2-amino-5-bromophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and/or EGTA, and various amounts of CaCl2, yielding the concentrations depicted (40Barg S.

Data were filtered through a low pass Bessel filter at 0.8–1 kHz and digitized at 2–5 kHz with an analog to digital converter (Digidata 1200, Axon Instruments) for computer analysis. Unitary conductances were estimated from the slope current/voltage relationship at 0 mV. The relative calcium permeability of the channels for Ca2+ versus monovalent ions (M+: potassium and Tris) was estimated from the reversal potential of the currents (Vcisreversal), and relative permeability (P) was estimated using the Fatt-Ginsborg Equation. Vcisreversal=(RT/2F)·ln4PCaCa2+trans/PMM+cisEquation 1 where PCa2+ and P Mare the permeability coefficients for Ca2+ and monovalent ions through the channel, R is the gas constant,T is the temperature in K, and F is the Faraday constant (42Shomer N.H. Mickelson J.R. Louis C.F. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 641-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The mean open probabilities (P o) of the channels at V cis = 0 mV were used as an index of activity to study the response of the channels to the following known modulators of RyRs: ATP, caffeine, calcium, magnesium, ruthenium red, and ryanodine. In most cases, P o were calculated from the 50% threshold analysis. In multiple channel experiments, the global open probability of the channels (nP o values) was calculated as before (41Copello J.

Its properties were similar to an enzyme described previously (Kelly, J. A., Neidle, E. L., and Neidle, A. (1983) J. Neurochem. 40, 1727–1734). Aspartyl aminopeptidase had barely detectable activity toward simple aminoacyl-naphthylamide substrates. Its activity was determined with the substrate Asp-Ala-Pro-naphthylamide in the presence of excess dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5). The native enzyme has a molecular mass of 440 kDa and migrates as a single band of 55 kDa after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of three tryptic peptides were used to screen the GenBankTM data base of expressed sequence tags. Human and mouse clones described as “similar to a yeast vacuolar aminopeptidase” and containing full-length cDNAs were identified and sequenced. The human cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence has significant homology to yeast aminopeptidase I, placing it as the first identified mammalian member of the M18 family of metalloproteinases. Homologous sequences in Caenorhabditis elegans and in prokaryotes revealed three conserved histidines, three conserved glutamates and five conserved aspartates. Aspartyl aminopeptidase is found at relatively high levels in all mammalian tissues examined and is likely to play an important role in intracellular protein and peptide metabolism.

Human and mouse clones described as “similar to a yeast vacuolar aminopeptidase” and containing full-length cDNAs were identified and sequenced. The human cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence has significant homology to yeast aminopeptidase I, placing it as the first identified mammalian member of the M18 family of metalloproteinases. Homologous sequences in Caenorhabditis elegans and in prokaryotes revealed three conserved histidines, three conserved glutamates and five conserved aspartates. Aspartyl aminopeptidase is found at relatively high levels in all mammalian tissues examined and is likely to play an important role in intracellular protein and peptide metabolism. Aminopeptidases catalyze the sequential removal of amino acids from the unblocked N termini of peptides and proteins. These enzymes are widely distributed in eukaryotes and prokaryotes (1Taylor A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 2Gonzales T. Robert-Baudroy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as either integral membrane or cytosolic proteins. Aminopeptidases are generally classified in terms of their substrate specificities, i.e.preference for a neutral, acidic, or basic amino acid in the P1 position. In the case of X-Pro aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase P; E.C. 3.4.11.9), it is the amino acid in the P1′ position that governs specificity. Most aminopeptidases are metalloenzymes, although cysteine and serine aminopeptidases have been described (2Gonzales T. Robert-Baudroy J. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 18: 319-344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their role in general protein and peptide metabolism, aminopeptidases have more specific functions. These include activation (3Cadel S. Pierotti A.R. Foulon T. Creminon C. Barre N. Segretain D. Cohen P. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1995; 110: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and inactivation (4Hersh L.B. Aboukhair N. Watson S. Peptides. 1987; 8: 523-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) of biologically active peptides, removal of the N-terminal methionine of newly synthesized proteins (5Kendall R.L. Bradshaw R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20667-20673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and possibly in the trimming of antigens for presentation by the major histocompatibility complex-1 system (6Harris C.A. Hunte B. Krauss M.R. Taylor A. Epstein L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6865-6869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The removal of N-terminal aspartyl and glutamyl residues from proteins and peptides in eukaryotes is catalyzed by glutamyl aminopeptidase (aminopeptidase A; EC 3.4.11.7), an enzyme first described by Glenner and Folk in 1961 (7Glenner G.G. Folk J.E. Nature. 1961; 192: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) (for a review, see Ref. 8Wilk S. Healy D.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 3: 195-207Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This membrane-bound ectoenzyme is a member of the metalloproteinase family M1 and contains the HEXXH + E zinc binding ligands (9Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Glutamyl aminopeptidase, first cloned as the murine BP-1/6C3 antigen (10Wu Q. Lahti J.M. Air G.M. Burrows P.D. Cooper M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), is a protein of 945 amino acids with a molecular mass of 107.8 kDa. The purified porcine, human, rat, and mouse enzymes are isolated as homodimers (8Wilk S. Healy D.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 3: 195-207Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A distinguishing feature of glutamyl aminopeptidase is its stimulation by Ca2+ (11Glenner G.G. McMillan P.J. Folk J.E. Nature. 1962; 194: 867-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The ability of glutamyl aminopeptidase to degrade angiotensins I and II is of considerable interest. The action of glutamyl aminopeptidase on angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) yields des-Asp angiotensin II, also known as angiotensin III. There is evidence that angiotensin III may mediate some of the effects of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain (12Wright J.W. Harding J.W. Brain Res. Rev. 1992; 17: 227-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A recent study utilizing 3-amino-4-thio-butyl sulfonate, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme, provided evidence for a predominant role of angiotensin III in the control of vasopressin release (13Zini S. Fournie-Zaluski M-C. Chauvel E. Roques B.P. Corvol P. Llorens-Cortes C. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11968-11973Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The same inhibitor was used to establish a major role of glutamyl aminopeptidase in the metabolism of cholecystokinin-8 (14Migaud M. Durieux C. Viereck J. Soroca-Lucas E. Fournie-Zaluski M-C. Roques B. Peptides. 1996; 17: 601-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The literature also contains two reports of a cytosolic acidic amino acid preferring aminopeptidase, which is distinct from glutamyl aminopeptidase. Cheung and Cushman (15Cheung H.S. Cushman D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 242: 190-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) described the partial purification of such an enzyme from the soluble fraction of a dog kidney extract. It is activated by preincubation with Mn2+and has a preference for Asp-2-naphthylamide (Asp-NA) 1The abbreviations used are: NA, 2-naphthylamide; THF, tetrahydrofuran; DMF, dimethylformamide; Boc,N-tert-butoxycarbonyl; t-Bu,tert-butyl; Fmoc, 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl; SM, sulfamethoxazole; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; DTT, dithiothreitol; Bicine,N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. over Glu-NA. Kellyet al. (16Kelly J.A. Neidle E.L. Neidle A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have more extensively characterized a high molecular weight (450,000) acidic amino acid specific aminopeptidase in mouse brain cytosol. One of the features of the mouse brain enzyme is its inability to cleave simple NA substrates such as Asp-NA and Glu-NA. Due to its instability, this enzyme was not previously purified to homogeneity. In view of our interest in the role of angiotensin III in the brain renin-angiotensin system (17Song L. Wilk S. Healy D.P. Brain Res. 1997; 744: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), we sought to further study the latter enzyme. A new assay was developed to measure its activity. We report on the purification, specificity, properties, subunit structure, molecular cloning, and expression of the enzyme we call aspartyl aminopeptidase. All peptide intermediates were obtained from Bachem Inc,. (Philadelphia, PA). Frozen rabbit brains were obtained from Pel Freez (Rogers, AR). Freshly dissected rat tissues were obtained from rats sacrificed in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Blitzer of the Department of Pharmacology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The following compounds were obtained from Sigma: angiotensins II and III, 2-naphthylamine, aspartyl-2-naphthylamide, glutamyl-2-naphthylamide, phenylalanyl-naphthylamide, Lys-Ala-naphthylamide, leucine enkephalin, Pro-Leu-glycinamide, leucyl-p-nitroanilide, aspartyl-β-hydroxamate, sulfamethoxazole, puromycin, bacitracin, amastatin, and bestatin. The following compounds were obtained from Aldrich: 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide,N-methylmorpholine, isobutylchloroformate, Silica Gel Merck, grade 9385. Affi-Gel blue and Bio Gel HTP hydroxylapatite were products of Bio-Rad. Q-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and Superose 6 were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. AcA-22 was obtained from Sepracor Inc. (Marlborough, MA). Oligonucleotide primers were obtained from IDT Inc. (Coralville, IA). Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat kidney as described (18Li J. Wilk E. Wilk S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 148-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A unit of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV activity is defined as the amount of enzyme releasing 1 μmol of NA/h from Ala-Pro-NA. Glutamyl aminopeptidase was purified to apparent homogeneity from rat kidney by immunoaffinity chromatography (8Wilk S. Healy D.P. Adv. Neuroimmunol. 1993; 3: 195-207Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A mixture of 7 mmol (1 g) of NA and 7 mmol (1.5 g) of Boc-Pro in 10 ml of dry THF was cooled to −20 °C. Next 7 mmol each of isobutylchloroformate and N-methylmorpholine were added, and the reactants were stirred for 20 min at this temperature. The reaction mixture was allowed to come to room temperature and filtered. The precipitate was washed with THF, and the combined THF fractions were evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in chloroform and sequentially washed with saturated NaHCO3, H2O, 10% citrate and H2O, dried over Na2SO4, and the chloroform was then removed by evaporation. The addition of ether to the residue resulted in crystallization of the product in 67% yield (1.6 g). The addition of 10 ml of 4 n HCl in dioxane to Boc-Pro-NA led to crystallization of Pro-NA·HCl from the reaction mixture. The product was obtained in quantitative yield following filtration and washing with ether. An equimolar amount of triethylamine was added to a suspension of 4.7 mmol of Pro-NA·HCl in 40 ml of DMF. The solution was then cooled to 0 °C, and equimolar amounts of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole were added. After stirring for 15 h at 0 °C, the mixture was filtered, the filtrate was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform. The chloroform was sequentially washed as described for Boc-Pro-NA. After drying over Na2SO4, the chloroform was removed by evaporation, and ether was added to the residue to facilitate crystallization of the product in quantitative yield. Treatment of Boc-Ala-Pro-NA with 10 ml of 4 n HCl in dioxane for 30 min at room temperature, followed by evaporation and the addition of ether to the residue, produced a quantitative yield of Ala-Pro-NA·HCl (compound 1). Triethylamine and Boc-Ala-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (0.5 mmol each) were added to a stirred solution of 0.5 mmol of compound 1 in 10 ml of DMF. The mixture was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. The solvent was then removed by evaporation, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform. The chloroform was sequentially washed with saturated NaHCO3, H2O, 10% citrate, and H2O. After drying over Na2SO4, the solvent was evaporated to yield 220 mg of Boc-Ala-Pro-NA. Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min followed by evaporation and ether precipitation, yielded 180 mg of Ala-Ala-Pro-NA·trifluoroacetate (yield, 36%; M + 1 = 384). N-Benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(O-t-Bu)-OH and triethylamine (0.5 mmol each) were added to a stirred solution of 0.5 mmol of compound 1 in 10 ml of DMF, followed by 0.5 mmol each of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide after the solution had cooled to 4 °C. The reaction was allowed to proceed at 4 °C for 18 h, after which time the mixture was filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness, the residue was dissolved in chloroform, and the chloroform extract was washed sequentially with saturated NaHCO3, H2O, 10% citrate, and H2O. After drying over Na2SO4, the chloroform was removed by evaporation, and the residue was purified by silica gel chromatography. The productN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp(O-t-Bu)-Ala-Pro-NA was eluted with a solution of 95% chloroform, 5% ethanol. The purified product was hydrogenated in the presence of 10% Pd/C to yield 139 mg of Asp(O-t-Bu)-Ala-Pro-NA. Treatment of this product with trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min followed by evaporation and ether precipitation yielded Asp-Ala-Pro-NA (M +1 = 427). Equimolar amounts of Boc-Glu(O-t-Bu)-ONS (Bachem) and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (0.5 mmol each) were added to 0.5 mmol of compound 1 dissolved in 20 ml of DMF. The mixture was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then poured into a flask containing 200 ml of ethyl acetate and 30 ml of H2O. The organic layer was washed with 2 × 20 ml of saturated NaHCO3, 2 × 20 ml of H2O, and 20 ml of saturated NaCl. After drying over Na2SO4, the solvent was removed in vacuo. The residue was washed with 50 ml of ethyl ether and then treated with trifluoroacetic acid for 1 h. After removal of the trifluoroacetic acid under high vacuum, the product Glu-Ala-Pro-NA was obtained in 81% yield. M + 1 = 441. Equimolar amounts of triethylamine and Fmoc-Asp-(O-t-Bu)-OH (0.5 mmol) were added to a stirred solution of 0.5 mmol of compound 1 in 10 ml of DMF. The solution was cooled to 4 °C, and then 0.5 mmol each of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydoxybenzotriazole were added. The solution was stirred at this temperature for 18 h and then filtered. The solvent was evaporated, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform and then washed with 10% citrate and H2O. After drying over Na2SO4 and evaporation of solvent, a hygroscopic solid was obtained. Treatment with trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min followed by ether precipitation yielded 186 mg of Fmoc-Asp-Ala-Pro-NA as white crystalline material (yield 29%;M + 1 = 650). Equimolar amounts of triethylamine and Boc-Ala were added to 1.6 mmol of Pro-SM·trifluoroacetic acid (prepared by coupling Boc-Pro to SM and deprotecting with trifluoroacetic acid) and dissolved in 20 ml of THF. The solution was cooled to 4 °C, equimolar amounts of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole were added, and the solution was stirred at this temperature for 18 h. The reaction mixture was filtered, the filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in chloroform and sequentially washed with saturated NaHCO3, H2O, 10% citrate, and H2O. After drying over Na2SO4, evaporation yielded 220 mg (0.42 mmol) of Boc-Ala-Pro-SM. Treatment with 4 n HCl in dioxane, evaporation, and crystallization by ether addition yielded 151 mg of Ala-Pro-SM·HCl (0.33 mmol). Equimolar amounts of triethylamine and Fmoc-Asp(O-t-Bu)-OH were added to 0.33 mmol of Ala-Pro-SM dissolved in 10 ml of THF plus 10 ml of DMF. Coupling with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole as described above yielded 201 mg of Fmoc-Asp(O-t-Bu)-Ala-Pro-SM (0.24 mmol). The Fmoc group was removed by treatment for 2 h with 5 ml each of DMF and diethylamine to yield 102 mg (0.16 mmol) of Asp(O-t-Bu)-Ala-Pro-SM. The final product was obtained in quantitative yield by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. M + 1 = 537. A series of tetrapeptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems model 430A peptide synthesizer by Fmoc chemistry. Peptide purity was evaluated by HPLC (see below). The activity of aspartyl aminopeptidase was measured by a coupled enzymatic assay similar to that described for the measurement of pyroglutamyl peptidase II (19Friedman T.C. Wilk S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 132: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this assay, the product of the action of aspartyl aminopeptidase is a substrate of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5). The reaction sequence is as follows, Asp­Ala­Pro­C→Aspartyl aminopeptidaseAsp+Ala­Pro­C Ala­Pro­C→Dipeptidyl­peptidase IVAla­Pro+C REACTIONS1AND2where C represents a chromogen. Initially, we used 2-naphthylamine as chromogen, and more recently we have used the less toxic and more soluble sulfamethoxazole. The released chromogen is measured by a colorimetric procedure following its diazotization (20Goldbarg J.A. Rutenberg A.M. Cancer. 1958; 11: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 μl of a 10 mm solution of substrate in Me2SO, 0.5 units of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, in a total volume of 250 μl. Partially purified enzyme preparations were assayed in the presence of 0.4 mm puromycin to eliminate the possible contribution of puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase (EC 3.4.11.14) to substrate hydrolysis. The substrate used to measure aspartyl aminopeptidase can also be cleaved in crude tissue samples by glutamyl aminopeptidase and possibly by the puromycin-sensitive aminopeptidase. Therefore, to measure aspartyl aminopeptidase in the supernatant fraction of homogenates of rat tissues, incubation buffers also contained Zn2+ and puromycin, each at a final concentration of 0.4 mm. We have determined that in crude tissue extracts, 0.4 mm Zn2+ totally inhibits glutamyl aminopeptidase but does not inhibit aspartyl aminopeptidase. Rat tissues were homogenized in 5 volumes of 25 mm Bicine buffer, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, in a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer fitted with a Teflon pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was taken for analysis. Incubation mixtures (final volume of 125 μl) contained 5 μl of tissue supernatant, 0.5 units of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, 5 μl of 10 mm Zn2+, 5 μl of 10 mmpuromycin, 5 μl of 10 mm Asp-Ala-Pro-SM in Me2SO, and Tris-HCl buffer (0.05 m, pH 7.5). Tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 125 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid. After centrifugation, 125 μl of supernatant was removed for analysis of chromogen. Protein was quantitated by the method of Lowry (21Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein elution from columns was monitored by absorbance at 280 nm. HPLC was performed on a Waters 600E liquid chromatograph equipped with a Vydac C4 protein column protected by a Vydac C4 5 μ guard column. For analysis of peptide purity, the column was equilibrated with 15% acetonitrile, 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution was carried out by linearly increasing the acetonitrile concentration to 70% over a period of 34 min. The products were monitored by measurement of absorbance at 210 nm. For analysis of angiotensin degradation, HPLC was run under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in a buffer consisting of 170 ml of acetonitrile and 5 ml of phosphoric acid diluted to 1 liter with H2O and adjusted to pH 3.0 with triethylamine. Peptides were detected by absorbance at 210 nm. SDS-PAGE was run on 10% gels according to the procedure of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Electrospray mass spectrometry was run at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by FPLC on a calibrated Superose 6 column. The column was equilibrated with 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 10% glycerol and calibrated with a high molecular weight calibration kit consisting of thyroglobulin, catalase, ferritin, and aldolase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The subunit molecular mass was determined by SDS-PAGE. A calibration kit supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech contained marker proteins ranging in molecular mass from 94.4 to 14.4 kDa. K m and V max were obtained by a least squares analysis of the Lineweaver-Burk plot. Determination of K i was by the method of Dixon (23Dixon M. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 170-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3290) Google Scholar). Each determination was conducted at two substrate concentrations and at six concentrations of competing peptide. Frozen rabbit brains (50 g) were partially defrosted and homogenized in a Waring blender with 4 volumes of 25 mmBicine, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol (buffer A). The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant was retained. The pellet was washed with an equal volume of buffer A and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g, and the supernatant fractions were combined. The supernatant was passed over a 2.5 × 20-cm column of Affi-Gel blue, 100–200 mesh, equilibrated with buffer A. The enzymatically active fractions of the effluent were combined. The enzymatically active fractions were applied to a 5 × 15-cm Q-Sepharose column, equilibrated with buffer A, and the column was then washed with 1500 ml of buffer A. The enzyme was eluted with a 2-liter 0–0.4 m NaCl gradient in buffer A. The active fractions were combined and concentrated in an Amicon ultrafiltration cell fitted with a PM-10 membrane. The concentrated enzyme was applied to a 2.5 × 90-cm AcA-22 column equilibrated with 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.1 m NaCl. The active fractions were combined, and NaCl was added to a final concentration of 0.3 m. The active fractions were chromatographed on a 1 × 7-cm phenyl-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl (buffer B). The column was washed with 30 ml of buffer B. The enzyme was eluted with 30 ml of 50 mm Bicine, pH 7.0, 60% glycerol. The active fractions were dialyzed against 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol (buffer C). The dialyzed enzyme was applied to a 2.5 × 1-cm column of hydroxylapatite equilibrated with buffer C, and the column was washed with this buffer. The effluent was collected, and fractions containing active enzyme were concentrated and then stored at −80 °C. Microsequencing was conducted at the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory of Yale University. Gel slices containing protein were digested with trypsin, and the eluate was subjected to microbore HPLC. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry was used to evaluate peak purity and identify candidate peaks suitable for sequencing. Two sequences were obtained, and a third sequence of a tryptic peptide was obtained from the Baker Medical Research Institute (Prahran, Australia). Nucleotide sequencing of ATCC clone 355377 was performed by the Biotechnology Center, Utah State University (Logan, UT) using sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). The cDNA coding for aspartyl aminopeptidase was excised from ATCC clone 355377 (lafmid BA plasmid) by first digesting withNotI and then partially digesting with BstXI to release a 1.55-kilobase pair piece containing the entire coding region minus 174 bp from the 5′-end. An adaptor was synthesized containing a 5′-overhang complementary to an NcoI digestion site on the 5′-end and a 3′-overhang complementary to theBstXI-generated overhang on the 3′-end. This adaptor contained the ATG start codon followed by six histidine codons, a glycine codon, and then the codon for asparagine normally present after the putative start codon in the aspartyl aminopeptidase sequence. The sequences of the oligonucleotides annealed to make the adaptor were 5′-CATGCACCATCACCACCATCACGGGCAG-3′ and 5′-GGCACTACCACCACTACCAC-3′. TheEscherichia coli expression plasmid pSE-420 (a gift from Dr. J. Brosius) was digested with NcoI and NotI. The digested pSE-420, the BstXI-NotI insert, and the adaptor were ligated to yield the plasmid pSE-6HDAP. The plasmid was transfected into XL-2 blue cells (Stratagene). The presence of the adaptor and insert was confirmed by restriction digestion. The cells containing the plasmid were grown in the presence of 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and aspartyl aminopeptidase activity was determined. Total RNA was prepared essentially by the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) from freshly frozen rat tissues. Formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transfer of 20 μg of RNA/lane were performed using the methods described in Sambrook et al. (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with 40 μCi of a mouse aspartyl aminopeptidase cDNA probe from ATCC clone 355377, which had been labeled to a specific activity of approximately 0.1 μCi/ng with [α-32P]dCTP using the NEBlot kit from New England Biolabs. Prehybridization and hybridization at 42 °C were carried out in 20 ml of 6× SSPE, 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% formamide, and 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Washes were in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 and 55 °C followed by a high stringency wash in 0.1× SSC, 0.01% SDS at 55 °C An RNA ladder from Life Technologies, Inc. was also electrophoresed for calculation of molecular size. The cytosol of a rabbit brain homogenate contained an enzyme that cleaved the substrate Asp-Ala-Pro-NA and that, in the presence of excess dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, liberated free naphthylamine. Enzymatic activity was optimal in the neutral pH range (Fig. 1). This enzyme having the properties of an aspartyl aminopeptidase (see below) was purified 722-fold by conventional chromatographic techniques from a rabbit brain supernatant, with an overall yield of 3.8% (TableI). Starting with 50 g of rabbit brain, 112 μg of enzyme protein was obtained. Examination of the enzyme by SDS-PAGE revealed a highly purified preparation containing a major protein band and trace amounts of higher molecular weight bands (Fig. 2).Table IPurificationStepVolumeActivityaEnzyme through step 4 was assayed in the presence of 0.4 mm puromycin.ProteinTotal activitySpecific activityRecoverymlunits/mlmg/mlunitsunits/mg%1.

One unit catalyzes the degradation of 1 μmol of Asp-Ala-Pro-sulfamethoxazole/h. The molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration chromatography on a calibrated FPLC Superose 6 column. The enzyme eluted identically with ferritin, establishing a molecular mass of 440 kDa. This value is virtually identical to the estimate of 450 kDa reported by Kelly et al. (16Kelly J.A. Neidle E.L. Neidle A. J. Neurochem. 1983; 40: 1727-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE gave a monomer molecular mass of 55 kDa. The specificity of the enzyme was explored with a series of peptides. Asp-Ala-Pro-SM and Asp-Ala-Pro-NA used for assay and purification were cleaved at the Asp-Ala bond, since release of the chromogen was dependent upon the presence of dipeptidyl-peptidase IV. Thek cat/K m ratio for Asp-Ala-Pro-NA exceeded that of the corresponding glutamyl peptide. The difference was primarily reflected in K m values with the glutamyl peptide binding very poorly to the enzyme. The enzyme required the presence of a free α-amino group. When the N terminus of the substrate Asp-Ala-Pro-NA was blocked by an Fmoc group, there was no cleavage.

https://openalex.org/W2067382627,"Monoglucosylation of low molecular mass GTPases is an important post-translational modification by which microbes interfere with eukaryotic cell signaling. Ha-Ras is monoglucosylated at effector domain amino acid threonine 35 by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, resulting in a blockade of the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. To understand the molecular consequences of this modification, effects of glucosylation on each step of the GTPase cycle of Ras were analyzed. Whereas nucleotide binding was not significantly altered, intrinsic GTPase activity was markedly decreased, and GTPase stimulation by the GTPase-activating protein p120GAP and neurofibromin NF-1 was completely blocked, caused by failure to bind to glucosylated Ras. Guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Cdc25)-catalyzed GTP loading was decreased, but not completely inhibited. A dominant-negative property of modified Ras to sequester exchange factor was not detectable. However, the crucial step in downstream signaling, Ras-effector coupling, was completely blocked. The K d for the interaction between Ras·GTP and the Ras-binding domain of Raf was 15 nm, whereas glucosylation increased theK d to >1 mm. Because the affinity of Ras·GDP for Raf (K d = 22 μm) is too low to allow functional interaction, a glucose moiety at threonine 35 of Ras seems to block completely the interaction with Raf. The net effect of lethal toxin-catalyzed glucosylation of Ras is the complete blockade of Ras downstream signaling.

Clostridium difficile toxins A and B are protein toxins with molecular masses of 308 and 270 kDa, respectively, and are the causative agents of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis (1Lyerly D.M.

Both toxins have been recently identified as glucosyltransferases that selectively modify the Rho subfamily proteins Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, but not prototypes of other Ras subfamilies such as Ras, Rab, and Ran (5Just I.

Glucosylation occurs at threonine 37 in Rho and threonine 35 in Rac and Cdc42, which are located in the effector region of the GTPases. Microinjection of glucosylated Rho freed of toxin induces morphological and cytoskeletal alterations that are identical to those induced by the toxin itself, indicating that the glucose moiety in the effector region grossly changes the properties of Rho to act in a dominant-negative manner (5Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. Von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Thus, glucosylation of Rho seems to be the molecular mechanism through which at least toxin B acts cytotoxically on cells. The lethal toxin from Clostridium sordellii, which belongs to the same family of large clostridial cytotoxins as do toxins A and B, is causally involved in diarrhea and enterotoxemia in domestic animals and in gas gangrene in man (8Hatheway C.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 3: 66-98Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lethal toxin has also been identified as a glucosyltransferase that, however, exhibits a different protein substrate specificity. Whereas the substrate specificity of toxin A/B is confined to the Rho subfamily proteins, isoforms of lethal toxin glucosylate both Rho and Ras subfamily proteins; Rac from the Rho subfamily and Ras, Ral, and Rap from the Ras subfamily are substrates of lethal toxin (9Just I.

They are involved in the transduction of extracellular signals to the nucleus. The active GTP-bound state is promoted by guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as SOS and Cdc25 that allow interaction with their effectors. The best studied effector is the Raf kinase, which is translocated to the membrane by interaction with Ras·GTP. Activated Raf initiates a linear downstream kinase cascade in which Erk kinase (p42/44 kinase) eventually leads to activation of transcription factors. In addition to Raf kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p120GAP, neurofibromin, MEKK-1, protein kinase Cζ, and the Ral GEF 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras-binding domain; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate); HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; mant, N-methylanthraniloyl; GDI, guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor. are putative effectors (15Marshall C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). The active state of Ras is terminated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that interact with the GTP-bound form of Ras to stimulate severalfold the intrinsic GTP-hydrolyzing activity (16Gideon P.

Ahmadian M.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We report here the functional consequences of glucosylation of the effector domain of Ras on guanine nucleotide release, on the GAP-induced stimulation of Ras GTPase activity, and on the coupling to the effector Raf kinase. The study of each step of the GTPase cycle gives evidence that glucosylation blocks Ras-effector coupling, resulting in complete inhibition of Ras downstream signaling. This inhibition seems to be the basis of the molecular mode of action of lethal toxin from C. sordellii. UDP-[14C]glucose was obtained from Biotrend (Cologne, Germany). All other reagents were of analytic grade and were from commercial sources. C. sordellii lethal toxin was prepared from strain 6018 as described (33Genth G. Hofmann F. Selzer J. Rex G. Aktories K.

For the time course, Ha-Ras (2 μm) previously loaded with GDP or GTPγS was incubated with lethal toxin (3 nm) in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 30 μmUDP-[14C]glucose, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl. At the indicated time points (see Fig. 1), samples were taken, stopped with Laemmli sample buffer, and run on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Incorporation of [14C]glucose was calculated from data of a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.). For all other experiments, Ha-Ras (400 μm) was incubated with lethal toxin (60 nm) in a buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 4 mm UDP-glucose, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.5 mm dithioerythritol at 37 °C for 3 h. The control was treated in the same way, but in the absence of lethal toxin. To test the amount of glucosylation, samples were diluted and then glucosylated in the presence of UDP-[14C]glucose as described above. Previously glucosylated Ras showed no incorporation of [14C]glucose, indicating complete modification in the first reaction. In addition, samples were analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Finnigan) to prove complete glucosylation (162-Da increase in mass). Ha-Ras (control and glucosylated) was incubated with 50 mm GTP in the presence of 10 mm EDTA on ice for 2 h. Unbound GTP was removed by gel filtration using elution buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mmdithioerythritol. Protein concentration was determined and then adjusted. Ha-Ras (100 μm) was incubated at 37 °C. At the indicated time points (see Fig. 3), samples were taken and subjected to HPLC (C18 column) to separate GDP and GTP (37Tucker J. Sczakiel G. Feuerstein J. John J. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1351-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ratio of the integrated areas of GTP to those of GTP plus GDP gives the extent of GTP hydrolysis. For determination of the GAP-stimulated GTPase activity, GAP-334 or NF1-333 was added to the assay described above. For control Ras, 3.8 nm GAP or 9 nm NF1-333 was used, and for glucosylated Ras, 15 μm GAP or 9.1 μm NF1-333 was used. Control Ras and glucosylated Ras (2.7 μm; both loaded with Gpp(NH)p) were incubated with 1.3 μm GST and GST-NF1-333, respectively, in binding buffer containing 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mmMgCl2, and 2 mm dithioerythritol at room temperature for 10 min. The samples were then immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washing the beads four times with binding buffer, the proteins were eluted by incubation with 20 mm glutathione dissolved in binding buffer on ice for 5 min. Eluted proteins were separated by 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-Methylanthraniloyl (mant)-labeled guanine nucleotides were used to determine GDP and GTP dissociation from Ras. Dissociation of mant-GDP/GTP from Ras caused a decrease in mant fluorescence, which was monitored in a Perkin-Elmer LS50 fluorescence spectrometer; emission was monitored at 442 nm with excitation at 366 nm. Guanine nucleotide exchange was determined according to Lenzen et al. (38Lenzen C. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 225: 95-109Crossref Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Ha-Ras (control and glucosylated) was incubated with 2.5 mmmant-GDP in the presence of 10 mm EDTA on ice for 2 h. Unbound mant-GDP was removed by gel filtration using elution buffer. Protein concentration was determined and then adjusted. GDP release from Ha-Ras (200 nm) was induced by addition of 100 μm unlabeled GDP in the absence and presence of Cdc25-GEFcat (50 and 100 nm) at 20 °C. The time course of the decrease in fluorescence was monitored. Dissociation rate constants (k off, min−1) were calculated by single exponential fit. To test whether glucosylated Ras sequesters Cdc25, Cdc25-GEFcat (50 nm)-stimulated mant-GDP release from control Ras (100 nm) was determined in the presence of 10 μm control Ras or 10 μmglucosylated Ras, each loaded with unlabeled GDP. Ha-Ras (control and glucosylated; 55 μm) was incubated with 2 mm mant-Gpp(NH)p in the presence of 2 units/ml alkaline phosphatase, 200 mm(NH4)2SO4, and 100 nmZnCl2 on ice for 2 h. Unbound mant-Gpp(NH)p was removed by gel filtration using elution buffer. Protein concentration was determined and then adjusted. Dissociation of mant-Gpp(NH)p from Ras (50 nm) was induced by addition of unlabeled GTP (100 μm) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of the Raf RBD (100 nm to 300 μm). Release was monitored by decrease in mant fluorescence. Dissociation rate constants (k obs) were obtained by fitting single exponentials to the data. The constants were fitted according to Ref. 21Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar to yield K d. The same experiments were performed with the Ral GEF (16 μm) instead of the Raf RBD and with NF1-333 (5 μm). To test competition between glucosylated and control Ras, Ras·mant-Gpp(NH)p (50 nm) binding to the Raf RBD (100 nm) was measured in the presence of 850 nm control Ras or 2500 nm glucosylated Ras, each loaded with unlabeled Gpp(NH)p. C. sordellii lethal toxinO-glucosylated Ha-Ras in the presence of the cosubstrate UDP-glucose. In the GDP-bound form, incorporation was 0.94 mol of glucose/mol of Ras, consistent with a monoglucosylation type of reaction (Fig. 1). Loading of Ras with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue GTPγS abolished modification almost completely, indicating that the hydroxyl group of the acceptor amino acid threonine 35 is involved in binding GTP. Therefore, we tested whether the glucose moiety at threonine 35 alters nucleotide binding, exchange, hydrolysis, and interaction with Ras regulatory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange of Ras was followed by changes in fluorescence resulting from the release of bound fluorophore-labeled nucleotide mant-GDP. To this end, glucosylated Ras was loaded with mant-GDP, followed by removal of unbound mant-GDP; exchange was started by addition of a surplus of unlabeled GDP. Fig. 2 A shows the nucleotide exchange of glucosylated versus unmodified Ras. The calculated k off values are 0.00010 s−1 for glucosylated Ras and 0.00002 s−1 for control Ras. Thus, glucosylation caused only an ∼5-fold enhancement of GDP release. GEF-stimulated GDP release was studied with the catalytic domain of the exchange factor Cdc25 (Cdc25-GEFcat). Compared with unmodified Ras, the exchange rate of glucosylated Ras was stimulated 10 times less (Fig. 2 A). The same decrease was found when the concentration of Cdc25-GEFcat was doubled (100 nm) at a constant Ras concentration (200 nm). Whereas Cdc25-GEFcat stimulated exchange of control Ras by a factor of 144, modified Ras was stimulated only by a factor of 12. Thus, glucosylation of Ras resulted in an increase in unstimulated GDP release, but a decrease in GEF-stimulated exchange. To test the possibility of Cdc25 sequestration by modified Ras, we studied whether glucosylated Ras was able to block Cdc25-stimulated exchange of control Ras. To this end, Cdc25-GEFcat (50 nm)-stimulated exchange of control Ras·mant-GDP (100 nm) was determined in the presence of a 100-fold excess of glucosylated or control Ras (10 μm). Fig. 2 B illustrates that glucosylated Ras acted like unmodified Ras, indicating that glucosylated Ras does not bind to Cdc25 with higher affinity than unmodified Ras to sequester Cdc25. However, sequestration of Cdc25 resulting in blocked exchange activity is observed in the presence of Ras-17N, a dominant-negative acting type of mutant Ras (19Chen S.Y. Huff S.Y. Lai C.C. Der C.J. Powers S. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2691-2698PubMed Google Scholar). Glucosylated Ras does not exhibit this dominant-negative property. The time course of hydrolysis of bound GTP in the absence of free nucleotide was followed by determination of the ratio of GTP to GDP plus GTP after given time points. The half-time of GTP hydrolysis of unmodified Ras was determined as ∼25 min, equivalent to ak cat of 0.028 min−1. Glucosylation of Ras increased the half-time up to 128 min (k cat = 0.0055 min−1). The low intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras was potently stimulated by GAPs. We employed the catalytic domain of p120GAP (GAP-334) and that of neurofibromin NF-1 (NF1-333). At a concentration of 3.8 nm GAP-334, the Ras GTPase was enhanced by a factor of 50,000 as depicted in Fig. 3 and TableI; NF1-333 (9.2 nm) was less stimulatory. However, both GAP-334 and NF1-333 were not able to enhance glucosylated Ras GTPase (Fig. 3); even 1000-fold higher concentrations than used for control Ras (15 μm GAP-334 and 9.2 μm NF1-333) did not enhance GTPase activity. Mere reduction, but not full inhibition, of the intrinsic GTPase is actually not caused by residual unmodified Ras; the complete inhibition of GAP stimulation argues against remnant effects, and furthermore, differential glucosylation and mass spectrometric analyses clearly showed complete modification. Thus, glucosylation of Thr-35 resulted in a decrease in GTPase activity to 20% and in an unresponsiveness to GAP stimulation. To test whether this unresponsiveness is caused by inhibition of Ras-GAP interaction by the glucose moiety, coprecipitation assays were performed. Because NF1-333 exhibited higher affinity for Ras than GAP-334, GST-NF1-333 fusion protein was employed. Control and glucosylated Ras both loaded with Gpp(NH)p were incubated with GST-NF1-333 immobilized on Sepharose beads, followed by release of NF-1 and NF-1·Ras complexes, respectively, with glutathione. Fig. 4 shows the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of eluted proteins. Whereas NF-1 bound to Ras, glucosylated Ras had lost this property. This finding was corroborated by a different approach, namely the GDI effect of NF-1 as described below. The glucose moiety in Thr-35 blocks NF-1 and Ras-GAP interaction, thus preventing the stimulation of the GTPase activity.Table IParameters measured for unmodified and glycosylated RasAffinity for Raf RBD,K dNucleotide dissociationGTPasek offCdc25-stimulatedIntrinsic,kcatGAP-stimulatedmant-GTPmant-GDPs−1-foldmin−1-foldRas15 nm0.000710.000021440.02850,000Glucosylated Ras>1 mm0.001700.00010120.0054No stimulationThe K d for the Ras complex with the Raf RBD and thek off value for mant-GTP were calculated from the measurement of the Ras-Raf interaction; the k offvalue for mant-GDP was calculated from the data of the exchange experiments.

Calculation was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Downstream signaling of Ras is based on the physical interaction of GTP-bound Ras with the Raf kinase to translocate Raf to the plasma membrane. This Ras-effector coupling can be characterized by the affinity of the Ras·Raf complex. Determination of the affinity (K d) is based on the so-called GDI effect of Raf. Raf binding to Ras blocks GTP release from Ras. The dissociation constant (K d) of the Ras·Raf complex can be calculated from the correlation of Raf concentration to inhibition of GTP release from Ras (20Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 21Herrmann C. Nassar N. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 66: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Control and glucosylated Ras were loaded with the mant-labeled nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue Gpp(NH)p to prevent nucleotide hydrolysis. Release of mant-Gpp(NH)p in the absence and presence of the Raf RBD was induced by addition of unlabeled GTP, and the time course of the release was followed by a decrease in mant fluorescence. For these experiments, the Raf RBD, which covers amino acid 51–131, was employed. Fig. 5 A shows the concentration-dependent decrease in GTP exchange of control Ras in the presence of increasing concentrations of the Raf RBD, from which a K d value of 15 nm was calculated. However, the Raf RBD did not exhibit any GDI effect on glucosylated Ras (Fig. 5 A), not even when the Raf RBD concentration was increased up to 300 μm(inset). For experimental reasons, we could not further increase the Raf RBD concentration. From these data, aK d value of at least 1 mm can be estimated. Because a K d of 22 μm for the Ras·Raf·GDP complex is believed to be insufficient for signal transmission, a K d value of 1 mmreflects complete absence of any interaction. In addition to the Raf RBD, we tested another Ras effector protein, namely the RBD of the Ral GEF (22Herrmann C. Horn G. Spaargaren M. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6794-6800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The Ral GEF is an exchange factor for the Ras-related GTPase Ral. The GDI effect of the RBD of the Ral GEF on Ras was also not detected with glucosylated Ras, corroborating the data found with the Raf RBD (data not shown). Hypothetically, glucosylated Ras might bind to the Raf RBD without affecting GTP release. If this is true, glucosylated Ras should compete with unmodified Ras for Raf binding. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the GDI effect of the Raf RBD on the release of mant-Gpp(NH)p from control Ras was competed by control Ras loaded with unlabeled nucleotide. However, glucosylated Ras did not do so, indicating no or at least very low binding to the Raf RBD. We also used the GDI effect to corroborate the coprecipitation experiments indicating that NF-1 did not bind to glucosylated Ras. The same procedure as described for Ras was applied, but instead of the Raf RBD, NF1-333 was used. Nucleotide exchange of 0.1 μmcontrol Ras (k off = 0.00075 min−1) was decreased by 5 μm NF1-333 (k off = 0.00016 min−1), whereas glucosylated Ras (k off = 0.00147 min−1) showed no change in the k offin the presence of NF1-333 (0.00153 min−1). From the exchange experiments based on GDP loading and the experiments of Ras-Raf interaction based on GTP release, no major difference in nucleotide release was detected between modified and unmodified Ras (Table I). These findings reflect the integrity of the protein structure of Ras and clearly argue against degradation as a basis for the effects of glucosylation on the GTPase cycle. Low molecular mass GTPases of the Ras superfamily are important regulators of intracellular signal transduction, and these cellular functions seem to predispose them to be preferred targets for bacterial protein toxins. Whereas the C3-like exoenzymes catalyze ADP-ribosylation of RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC at Asn-41, C. difficile toxins A and B monoglucosylate the members of the Rho subfamily, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, at threonine 37/35 (5Just I.

Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P. Cussac D. Antonny B. Chavrier P. Flatau G. Giry M. de Gunzburg J. Boquet P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). As can be deduced from the crystal structure of Ha-Ras, the hydroxyl moiety of threonine 35, together with serine 17, is involved in the coordination of Mg2+, which ligates the γ- and β-phosphates of GTP. Thus, the hydroxyl group of Thr-35 is not assessable for modification (26Pai E.F. Kabsch W. Krengel U. Holmes K.C. John J. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1989; 341: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar, 27Pai E.F. Krengel U. Petsko G.A. Goody R.S. Kabsch W. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2351-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar). In the GDP-bound form, loop-2 moves and threonine 35 is exposed to the surface of the molecule. Furthermore, threonine 35 is important for coordination of the Mg2+ ion and the positioning of the nucleophilic water molecule in the GTP conformation (28John J. Rensland H. Schlichting I. Vetter I. Borasio G.D. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 923-929Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These structural considerations imply that Ras·GDP rather than Ras·GTP should be the preferred substrate for glucosylation. This notion is supported by experimental data: inactive GDP-bound Ras is monoglucosylated, whereas active Ras stabilized by binding to nonhydrolyzable GTPγS prevents glucosylation. Thus, this type of toxin-catalyzed modification is strictly dependent on the conformation of the target protein Ras. Although the bound nucleotide significantly affects the glucosylation reaction, the glucosylation of Ras does not grossly alter binding of GDP of GTP (Table I). Nucleotide dissociation is only slightly increased by glucosylation; the k off for GTP dissociation is doubled, and that for GDP is increased ∼5-fold. In contrast to the intrinsic nucleotide dissociation, GEF-stimulated GDP exchange is decreased by glucosylation. This effect has been proven not to be based on GEF sequestration by modified Ras, thus excluding any increase in binding affinity of modified Ras for Cdc25. Mediation of the nucleotide exchange by GEFs (Cdc25) is not fully understood. Most likely, the GEFs induce a conformational change through binding to Ras, which then facilitates nucleotide release. 2R. Cool, personal communication. The decreased exchange activity toward glucosylated Ras may be caused by the inability of modified Ras to perform the GEF-induced conformational change or, alternatively, by reduced binding affinity for Cdc25. However, the latter possibility cannot be easily tested because of the low affinity interaction of Cdc25 with Ras.2 Nevertheless, GEF-Ras interaction is qualitatively different from that of GAP and effector proteins with Ras because glucosylation modulates Cdc25 activity, but completely blocks GAP activity and the interaction with effectors. Glucosylation reduces the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras to 20%, but obviously does not cause full blockade. Complete inhibition, however, is observed for stimulation of GTP hydrolysis by GAP (p120GAP and NF-1), which normally stimulates the GTP-hydrolyzing activity of control Ras by a factor of 50,000. The remaining intrinsic GTPase activity is not due to a remnant of unmodified Ras because of the finding of complete inhibition of GAP action. Because Thr-35 is not directly involved in GTP hydrolysis, complete inhibition of GTPase activity was not expected. The observed decrease in intrinsic GTPase may be caused by diverting the nucleophilic water molecule and by indirect alteration of the vicinity of Thr-35 by the glucose moiety. It has been shown that point mutations in the effector region (amino acids 35, 36, and 38) make Ras insensitive to GAP stimulation (16Gideon P. John J. Frech M. Lautwein A. Clark R. Scheffler J.E. Wittinghofer A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2050-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29Adari H. Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Der C.J. McCormick F. Science. 1988; 240: 518-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), so it is conceivable that modification of one of these residues results in blocked interaction. Indeed, complete inhibition of the direct interaction of GAP with Ras is deduced from the coprecipitation experiments and from the lack of GDI effect of NF-1 on nucleotide exchange of Ras. We used for these studies the catalytic domain of NF-1 instead of GAP-334 because NF-1 exhibits a higher affinity for Ras·GTP, thus allowing pull-down experiments (30Ahmadian M.R. Hoffmann U. Goody R.S. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4535-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). GAP-induced enhancement of GTPase activity is mediated by providing an arginine side chain in the catalytic center of Ras (31Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W. Wiesmüller L. Lautwein A. Schmitz F. Wittinghofer A. Science. 1997; 277: 333-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Alteration of the correct positioning of this arginine finger results in complete loss of the GAP catalytic effect. The pivotal step for downstream signaling is the Ras-Raf interaction. The affinity of the functional complex between GTP-bound Ras and Raf kinase was determined to be 15 nm, which is in line with the published value of 18 ± 3 nm (20Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP decreases the K d value of the complex by 3 orders of magnitude to 22 μm, an affinity that is apparently insufficient for downstream signaling (20Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Thus, aK d value of at least 1 mm for the Raf complex with glucosylated Ras reflects the absence of interaction, resulting in a complete inhibition of signal transduction. Ras-Ala35, a mutant Ras that lacks functional activity, binds to Raf with aK d of 3.4 μm (20Herrmann C. Martin G.A. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). This affinity is ∼3 orders of magnitude higher than that of glucosylated Ras, supporting the notion that the glucose moiety blocks the function of threonine 35, but, in addition, acts through steric hindrance in the effector domain. The possibility that Raf binds to modified Ras without affecting nucleotide exchange was ruled out by competition experiments. Glucosylated Ras seems to lack any binding affinity for Raf kinase. Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of the Ras-binding domain of c-Raf1 in complex with Rap1A was elucidated (32Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The so-called effector domain, which covers residues 32–40, is identical in Ras and Rap. This domain is in close contact with the Ras-binding domain of Raf (residues 51–131), but threonine 35 of Rap/Ras is not directly involved in this complex formation. Because exchange of Thr-35 with Ala decreases the affinity of the Ras·Raf complex ∼100-fold, at least an indirect participation of Thr-35 in this interaction is likely. A hydrophilic glucose group at this residue may alter the structure of this region more than just an amino acid exchange does, and it is conceivable that the glucose group in the interface blocks the formation of the contact between the Raf RBD and Ras/Rap through steric hindrance. In addition to Raf kinase, we tested Ral GEF binding to glucosylated Ras and found identical results, i.e. glucosylation completely inhibits interaction. Because the Ras effector region participates in effector coupling with all known Ras targets, it is very likely that glucosylation prevents signaling of all Ras-dependent pathways. The recently reported inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK1/2 after intoxication of intact cells with the lethal toxin can thus be fully explained by inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signal pathway at the Ras level (9Just I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10217-10224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The observed effects of glucosylation on divers Ras functions have been also found for glucosylated Rho and Rac GTPases that are modified byC. difficile toxins A and B (39Sehr P. Gili J. Genth H. Just I. Pick E. Aktories K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5296-5304Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional consequences of a glucose group in the effector region seem to be identical for the homologous low molecular mass GTPases. In conclusion, glucosylation of the Ras effector region by bacterial exotoxins causes several effects on the Ras GTPase. Whereas nucleotide binding is not grossly altered, intrinsic GTPase activity is markedly decreased, and GAP stimulation is completely blocked, findings that indicate activation of Ras rather than inactivation. Guanine nucleotide exchange factor-catalyzed GTP loading is decreased, but not inhibited. However, the crucial step in downstream signaling, Ras-effector coupling, is completely blocked, and this functional consequence finally determines the net effect of glucosylation on the GTPase cycle,i.e. the blockade of Ras signal transduction.

In order to better characterize the interactions between Grb10 and the activated GHR complex, as well as to test the potential role of this new adaptor protein in GHR signaling, we used 293 cells co-transfected with GHR and Grb10 cDNA. We show that Grb10 associates with the GHR·Jak2 complex through several binding sites and regulates specific pathways of GHR signaling. A cDNA fragment encoding the domain between amino acids (aa) 454–620 of the rabbit GHR was inserted into the bacterial expression vector pGEX-2TK as described previously (7Sotiropoulos A.

After purification, phages were converted to plasmids by using bacterial strain BM25.8 (Novagen). These plasmids were used to transform bacterial strain DH5α and inserts were sequenced. Huh-7 and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 293 cells (4 × 106 in 100-mm Petri dish) were transfected with the calcium method procedure by Flag-tagged rabbit GHR, mJak2, and mGrb10 cDNAs.

The bound proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 7.5% polyacrylamide gels and submitted to Western blot experiments. Membranes were incubated with the designed antibody. After extensive washing, membranes were developed using a chemiluminescent reaction (ECL, Dupont de Nemours). For the in vitro experiment (Fig. 6 D), lysates from 2 μg of Jak2 cDNA-transfected cells were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with 10 μg of GST or GST-Grb10 SH2 proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, or with 1/500 anti-Jak2 antibody (UBI). Blots were analyzed with the anti-Jak2 antibody (1/4000) or the anti-Tyr(P) (1/10000, UBI). 293 cells were plated in 6-well plates (4 × 105 cells/well) and were transfected with Grb10 cDNA (100 ng to 1 μg), the reporter gene (100 ng of SRE-tk-Luc, 1.5 μg of GHRE2 or LHRE-tk-Luc), the GHR cDNA (50 ng in tests with SRE-tk-Luc, 200 ng for the other tests) and 50 ng of cytomegalovirus β-galactosidase cDNA. In experiments with the SRE-tk-Luc, 20 ng of Jak2 cDNA were also transfected. Cells were incubated for 16 h in serum-free medium containing 50 nm hGH and then were lysed as described (11Sotiropoulos A. Perrot-Applanat M. Dinerstein H. Pallier A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Cell extracts were used for determination of luciferase and β-galactosidase activities and luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. The principle of the CORT cloning methodology involves the use of the tyrosine-phosphorylated COOH terminus of tyrosine kinase receptors in order to identify new SH2 domain containing molecules (17Skolnik E.Y. Margolis B. Mohammadi M. Lowenstein E. Fischer R. Drepps A. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1991; 65: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar,18Margolis B. Silvennoinen O.

The intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the cytoplasmic domain of EGF receptor allowed the phosphorylation and the radiolabeling with32P of the tyrosine residues in a single step. As the GHR cannot autophosphorylate, we prepared our probe in two steps: first we expressed the GHR COOH terminus from residue 454 to 620 downstream of the GST and a protein kinase A phosphorylation site in TKB1 bacteria, which display intrinsic Elk tyrosine kinase activity. This tyrosine kinase permitted very strong (non-radioactive) phosphorylation of the receptor (data not shown). Second, the tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-protein kinase A phosphorylation site, GHR454–620, was purified and radiolabeled in vitro with protein kinase A and high specific activity [γ-32P]ATP. In order to check the specificity of our probe, we incubated it with different bacterially expressed proteins spotted on filters. The phosphorylated GST-GHR454–620 only bound to SH2 domains of certain signaling proteins such as p85α and phospholipase Cγ as well as SHP-2 (Fig. 1 A). No binding was detected with SH2 domains of Grb2 and SHP-1. The integrity of these fusion proteins were verified by their ability to bind specifically to tyrosines contained in Shc or in the erythropoietin receptor, respectively, as described (8VanderKuur J. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7587-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 28Klingmuller U. Lorenz U. Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Lodish H.F. Cell. 1995; 80: 729-738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Control GST also did not bind to the probe (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, when the fusion construct was expressed in MH1 bacteria and was thus not tyrosine phosphorylated, no interaction was observed, suggesting that the positive signals obtained are specific to the phosphorylated tyrosines. The tyrosine-phosphorylated and radiolabeled probe was then used to screen the λEXlox embryonic mouse expression library. Among 1.6 million clones screened, eight positives were obtained. Sequencing revealed that they encoded six different proteins, all of which contained SH2 domains (Fig. 2). The clones obtained twice also gave the strongest signals. They encoded the adaptor Shc and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Shc has been previously shown to interact with Jak2 upon GH stimulation (8VanderKuur J. Allevato G. Billestrup N. Norstedt G. Carter-Su C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7587-7593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), but our result demonstrates that Shc can also be a direct target of GHR. Moreover as the clone obtained does not contain the PTB coding sequence, we show that Shc can interact directly with GHR through its SH2 domain. The p85 clone is identical to the β isoform of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The protein Csk, which regulates the activity of c-Src family molecules (29Nada S. Okada M. MacAuley A. Cooper J.A. Nakagawa H. Nature. 1991; 351: 69-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and the mouse homologue of the adaptor Shb (30Welsh M. Mares J. Karlsson T. Lavergne C. Breant B. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 19-27PubMed Google Scholar) were also identified. DNA sequencing of the last two clones revealed that they are highly related to Grb4 and Grb10 (18Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). Our Grb4 clone is 61% identical at the protein level to human Nck, and 94% identical to the partial protein sequence of mouse Grb4 (18Margolis B. Silvennoinen O. Comoglio F. Roonprapunt C. Skolnik E. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8894-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The Grb10 clone contains a 0.8-kilobase insert encoding a 160-aa polypeptide which is almost identical to the carboxyl-terminal part of the recently identified signaling mediator Grb10 (Fig. 3 A) (31Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). The SH2 domain of our clone, which was named Grb10-GHR, is 100% identical to the SH2 domain of the previously published mouse Grb10 sequence (31Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). However, two contiguous aa substitutions (Asn491 → Lys, Gly492 → Arg) were observed in the region of the molecule upstream of the SH2 domain. In addition, there is a divergence located 70 base pairs after the stop codon, between the 3′-untranslated region from our clone which is terminated by a cluster of Ala, and the 3′-untranslated region of the published mouse Grb10 sequence (Fig. 3 A). Moreover interaction between the receptor and the Grb10-GHR clone expressed in the library was characterized using as a probe the32P-labeled COOH-terminal domain of the GHR expressed in MH1 bacteria. Under these conditions, there was no interaction of the clone with the probe as shown by the lack of radioactive signal on the right portion of Fig. 3 B. This indicates that the interaction between Grb10-GHR and the receptor involves one or several of the phosphorylated tyrosine residue(s) located between amino acids 454 and 620 of the receptor. Under our experimental conditions, one or several of the tyrosine residues present in the fusion protein could be phosphorylated. For all the positive clones expressed in the library, the interaction was dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation of the probe (data not shown). Human hepatoma cells and in particular Huh-7 cells were reported to express hGrb10 (24Dong L.Q. Du H. Porter S.G. Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lee A.V. Mandarino J. Fan J. Yee D. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29104-29112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and hGHR (25Mullis P.E. Lund T. Patel M.S. Brook C.G. Brickell P.M. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1991; 76: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 26Esposito N. Paterlini P. Kelly P.A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 103: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We thus used this cell line to test the association between hGrb10 and the receptor (Fig. 4). In lysates from cells stimulated with GH, a broad 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band was co-precipitated specifically with Grb10 antibodies; this band was absent in immunoprecipitates with control antibody. Reprobing of the blot with an anti-GHR antibody identified this band as the receptor. A control blot with the anti-Grb10 antibody confirmed that similar amounts of hGrb10 were present in the two conditions of immunoprecipitation and that the association was induced by the hormonal stimulation. As we were not able to efficiently immunoprecipitate the receptor with our anti-GHR antibodies, we decided to construct an epitope Flag-tagged GHR to study in more detail the interactions between the receptor complex and Grb10. Constructs were done with GHRwt and a carboxyl-terminal truncated mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain that we used for the screening of GHR-associated molecules. 293 cells were co-transfected with expression vectors containing the cDNAs of mGrb10 and Jak2, GHRwt (Fig. 5 A), or GHR454(Fig. 5 B). Lysates from cells stimulated or not with hGH were immunoprecipitated with an antibody directed against the Flag epitope fused to the receptor. Immunoblotting with an anti-Grb10 antibody revealed the association of the three isoforms of mGrb10 with the GHRwt (Fig. 5 A, top panel), as well as with the deleted mutant GHR454 (Fig. 5 B, top panel). The three bands could correspond to Grb10 isoforms generated by alternative use of initiation sites of translation as reported (31Ooi J. Yajnik V. Immanuel D. Gordon M. Moskow J.J. Buchberg A.M. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1621-1630PubMed Google Scholar). When GHR cDNA was not transfected, a faint signal was detected suggesting that a low amount of Grb10 nonspecifically associated with the anti-Flag antibody or the beads. When Grb10 cDNA was not transfected, no band was seen, suggesting the absence of a detectable level of endogenous Grb10 in the 293 cells. Similar amounts of Flag-tagged GHRs were observed in each lane, as shown after membrane stripping and blotting with an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 5,Aand B, lower panels). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots showed that Grb10 has no effect on the GH-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the full-length receptor upon GH stimulation (Fig. 5 A, middle panel). In contrast, GHR454 was not significantly phosphorylated under hormonal stimulation as reported previously (11Sotiropoulos A. Perrot-Applanat M. Dinerstein H. Pallier A. Postel-Vinay M.C. Finidori J. Kelly P.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 1292-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B, middle panel). We thus speculated that Grb10 association with the truncated receptor might be mediated through an interaction with the receptor associated kinase Jak2. 293 cells were transfected with or without 2 μg of Jak2 cDNA (under these conditions Jak2 is able to autophosphorylate) and with or without 2 μg of Grb10 cDNA (Fig. 6,A-C). When cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Grb10 antibody and revealed with anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 6 B), a 120-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated band was present in Grb10 immunoprecipitates. This band was only present when Jak2 cDNA was co-transfected and was absent in control experiments with preimmune serum (Fig. 6 A). When cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody (Fig. 6 C) and revealed with anti-Tyr(P) antibody, no significant difference in Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation could be observed due to Grb10 overexpression. The data shown in Fig. 6, B and C, suggested that Grb10 is also able to associate with Jak2 without affecting its level of tyrosine phosphorylation. However, stripping and reprobing of this blot with an anti-Jak2 antibody failed to directly identify the phosphorylated band as Jak2. It is possible that only a low amount of Jak2 bound to Grb10 under these conditions. This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that the anti-Tyr(P) antibody exhibits stronger affinity than the anti-Jak2 antibody. In vitroexperiments were then performed to confirm Grb10 interaction with Jak2 (Fig. 6 D). Lysates from cells transfected with or without Jak2 cDNA were incubated with GST alone, GST-SH2Grb10, or immunoprecipitated with anti-Jak2 antibody. Specific binding of Jak2 to the Grb10 SH2 domain was detected by an anti-Jak2 immunoblot while only a very low amount of Jak2 associated with GST alone. In order to test the involvement of Grb10 in GHR signaling, we used three reporter genes: SRE-tk-Luc which binds transcriptional factors activated by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (32Norman C.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1754-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 36Metz R. Ziff E. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2165-2178PubMed Google Scholar), GHRE2-tk-Luc which binds Stat5 (6Wood T.J. Sliva D. Lobie P.E. Pircher T.J. Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Gustafsson J.A. Groner B. Norstedt G. Haldosen L.A. J. Biol.

Asins G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21532-21539PubMed Google Scholar), and LHRE-tk-Luc which only contains Stat5 DNA-binding elements (7Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocr. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Increasing amounts of Grb10 cDNA strongly inhibited the 3-fold GH induction of SRE-tk-Luc reporter gene (70% inhibition) and also to a lesser extent the 9-fold GH induction of the GHRE2 promoter (30% inhibition) (Fig. 7). In contrast, no significant difference was observed in the 15-fold stimulation by GH of LHRE-tk-Luc. Moreover, basal levels remained unchanged (data not shown). Only the GH-stimulated fraction decreased significantly in the SRE and GHRE2 tests. Control transfections with the empty vector of Grb10 had no effect. Thus, Grb10 could be involved as a negative regulator of specific enhancer activities of GH-stimulated genes. Our results with the three functional tests further suggested that Grb10 interferes with GHR signaling downstream of Jak2 and independently of Stat5 activation as the three pathways are dependent of Jak2 activation and both LHRE and GHRE2 can bind Stat5. The data shown in Fig. 6 C demonstrated that overexpression of Grb10 did not inhibit Jak2 tyrosine phosphorylation. In Fig. 8, we analyzed the"
https://openalex.org/W2086640618,"Toxins A and B of Clostridium difficile are UDP-glucose glucosyltransferases that exert their cellular toxicity primarily through their abilities to monoglucosylate, and thereby inactivate, Rho family small GTPases. Toxin A also hydrolyzes UDP-glucose, although this activity is not well characterized. In this study, we measured the kinetics of UDP-glucose hydrolysis by toxins A and B and found significant differences in the catalytic activities of these two structurally homologous toxins. The toxins displayed similar Michaelis constants (K m) for UDP-glucose, but the maximal velocity (V max) of toxin B was ∼5-fold greater than that of toxin A. Toxins A and B exert their enzymatic actions intracellularly, and, interestingly, we found that each toxin absolutely required K+ for optimal hydrolase activity; Na+ was inactive. The toxins also required certain divalent cations for activity and exhibited a significantly greaterV max and lower K m in the presence of Mn2+ as compared with Mg2+. We conclude that C. difficile toxins A and B are cation-dependent UDP-glucose hydrolases that differ significantly in their catalytic activities, a finding that may have important implications in understanding their different cytotoxic effects."

Our results, together with accumulation of genomic informations, will stimulate new considerations and experiments in gene expression studies. Genome projects are underway in various model organisms, and sequencing of large genomic regions has already begun. Along with physical mapping data, the comparison of genomic sequences with expressed sequences obtained by sequencing total cDNA libraries will identify the relative positions of genes within large genomic regions (1Rowling C. Searls D.B. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Several large-scale DNA studies have pointed out that in many regions there is a high density of genes with related or unrelated physiological functions (2Ansari L.M. Shen Y. Muzny D.M. Lee W. Gibbs R.A. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 268-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A role for genomic disposition seems to be attested by the existence of gene clusters conserved during the evolutionary process such as the homeobox gene clusters in animals and plants (3McGinnis W. Krumlauf R. Cell. 1992; 68: 283-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar), the β-globin loci in mammals (4), and the cholinergic locus in animals (5Cervini R. Houhou L.

Furthermore, the identification of families of proteins suggests the implication of common ancestral genes, duplications, mutations, and genomic rearrangements during evolution. An additional complexity is the association within a protein of structural motifs issued from different families of proteins (6Hilton D.J. Richardson R.T. Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Willson T.A.

However, the mechanism of generation of such hybrid molecules during evolution is not understood. Whether gene disposition in the genome participates in new protein building remains to be addressed. In this study, we provide evidence that two adjacent human genes coding for unrelated proteins can be considered as a single transcription unit. The unexpected transcription unit is formed upon cotranscription and fusion splicing of genes encoding GALT 1The abbreviations used are: GALT, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase; IL-11Rα, interleukin-11 receptor α-chain; kb, kilobase(s); RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; pol, polymerase. and IL-11Rα.

The screening of orderly spotted colony filters was performed using standard hybridization procedures for Hybond N+ membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Positive clones were tested to ensure that they were single colonies. Clones were grown in LB medium containing 20 μg/ml kanamycin. DNA was prepared using a plasmid DNA preparation kit (QIAGEN Inc.). One μg of DNA was digested for 2 h at 37 °C with EcoRI or HindIII or both. The DNA was subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis on a CHEF apparatus (Bio-Rad) in 1% agarose and 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA at 140 V for 10 h and a pulse time of 10 s. DNA samples were depurinated and alkali-transferred to nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotides (Gal1 (GALT exon 1) and B9E (IL-11Rα exon 2), see sequences below; B23 (GALT exon 10), GCAGCTGCCAATGGTTCCAG; B31 (IL-11Rα exon 1), TAGCTGGTGAGAGGAAGTCC; B22 (IL-11Rα exon 7), CATGCCCACAGGATCCCCTA; and B14 (IL-11Rα exon 13), GCTGAAAGGTGCTTGTACCTCT) were phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 kinase and hybridized at 45 °C to Hybond N+ filters according to the manufacturer's recommended conditions and washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 45 °C for 30 min. A human placenta cDNA library (provided by B. Lethé, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium) containing inserts with an average size of 2.5 kb was screened using the human IL-11Rα probe following the experimental procedure of Chérel et al. (17Chérel M. Sorel M. Lebeau B. Dubois S. Moreau J.F. Bataille R. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 2534-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three positive clones were isolated and analyzed by restriction mapping. One of these clones, A11, was fully sequenced. Total RNA was extracted from human cell lines and tissues using the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol method (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63231) Google Scholar). Human liver, brain, and small intestine total RNAs were purchased fromCLONTECH. The first cDNA strand was synthesized using total RNA (5 μg) at 37 °C for 1 h in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 60 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mmMgCl2, 20 units of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer, Mannheim, Germany), 1 mm each dNTP, 10 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 0.5 μg of oligo(dT)12–18. Five μl of the reaction mixture was made up to 50 μl using Taq polymerase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, and 1.5 mm MgCl2) containing 25 pmol of each primer and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Amplifications were performed using a thermal cycler for 30 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 60 °C, and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. PCR was performed with the following primers: Gal1, 5′-GCGGATCCATGTCGCGCAGTGGAACCGA; and B4, 5′-CAACACAGCTTCACGGACCTG. PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and analyzed by Southern blotting. Control PCR was performed using β-actin primers (5′-CGTGCTGCTGACCGAGGCC (sense) and 5′-TTCGTGGATGCCACAGGAC (antisense)) to check RNA integrity. PCR was performed with primers FG6 (5′-CTGGAACCATTGGCAGCTGC) and B4. The PCR product was purified and ligated into pNoTA/T7, resulting in pNoFG6-B4, and sequenced on both strands. The antisense RNA probe was synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol) using pNoFG6-B4 DNA as the template. The labeled RNA probe was treated with DNase I and purified by electrophoresis on an 8 m urea and 5% polyacrylamide gel. RNase protection assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (RPAII kit, Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). Gels were used to expose x-ray film overnight, and autoradiographic signals were quantified on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The 1.3-kbXhoI-EcoRI fragment from the BQM15.C cDNA clone containing human IL-11Rα (17Chérel M. Sorel M. Lebeau B. Dubois S. Moreau J.F. Bataille R. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. Blood. 1995; 86: 2534-2540Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was ligated into theXhoI-EcoRI sites of pKCSRα (kindly provided by R. Breathnach, INSERM U463, Nantes, France), forming pKCSRα-IL-11Rα. For construct pKCSRα-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα, PCR was performed with primers Gal1 and B9E (5′-GCGAATTCGAGGCAGACACCAGGGCTGT). The PCR product was purified and inserted into pNoTA/T7, resulting in pNoGAL1-B9E, and sequenced on both strands. TheEcoRI-BglII fragment from pNoGAL1-B9E and theBglII-XhoI fragment from A11 were inserted into pLXSP (Transgen), creating pLXSP-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα. The 2.3-kbEcoRI-NotI fragment from pLXSP-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα was inserted into pKCSRα, creating pKCSRα-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα. For construct pKCSRα-GALT, PCR was performed with primers Gal1 and G11 (5′-GCTCTAGATCAGGCGATGGTTGCTGTCT). The PCR product was purified, inserted into pNoTA/T7 (resulting in pNoGAL1-G11), and sequenced on both strands. TheEcoRI-BglII fragment from pNoGAL1-B9E and theBglII-XbaI fragment from pNoGAL1-G11 were inserted into pKCSRα, creating pKCSRα-GALT. For construct pKCSRα-GALTΔ11, PCR was performed with primers Gal1 and G10 (5′-GCTCTAGATCACTGCTCAGGGGTGAGGTCCC). The PCR product was purified, inserted into pNoTA/T7 (resulting in pNoGAL1-G10), and sequenced on both strands. The EcoRI-BglII fragment from pNoGAL1-B9E and the BglII-XbaI fragment from pNoGAL1-G10 were inserted into pKCSRα, creating pKCSRα-GALTΔ11. The human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937, the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562, the osteogenic sarcoma cell line SAOS-2, the human myeloma cell line RPMI 8226, the human bone marrow metastatic neuroblastoma cell line SKNSH, and COS-7 monkey kidney cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). All cell lines except COS-7 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mmglutamine. COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mm glutamine. Ba/F3 cells (provided by J.-F. Moreau, CNRS UMR5540, Bordeaux, France) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 10% WEHI-3-conditioned medium as a source of IL-3 (24Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The Kit 225 cell line (obtained from D. A. Cantrell, ICRF, London, United Kingdom), was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 20 ng/ml IL-2, and 2 mm glutamine. The T cell clones, derived from the skin of a patient suffering acute graft-versus-host disease after allogenic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-mismatched related donor, were kindly provided by H. Vié (INSERM U463) (25Gaschet J. Trevino M.A. Cherel M. Vivien R. Garcia S.A. Hallet M.M. Bonneville M. Harrousseau J.L. Bragado R. Milpied N. Vie H. Blood. 1996; 87: 2345-2353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). COS-7 cells (2 × 106 cells/plate) were transfected using the DEAE-dextran/chloroquine method (26Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3365-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar) with 6 μg of pKCSRα-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα, pKCSRα-GALT, pKCSRα-IL-11Rα, or pKCSRα-GALTΔ11. Confluent COS-7 cells (48 h after transfection) were scraped, pelleted, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5), and stored at −70 °C. Cells were thawed at 0 °C; resuspended in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.25 m sucrose, 2 mmMgCl2, and 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin; homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer; and centrifuged for 20 min at 2500 rpm at 4 °C. The clarified supernatant (12,000 rpm, 20 min) was centrifuged again at 48,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C to obtain the cytosolic protein lysate in a final volume of 500 μl. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.25m sucrose and centrifuged twice (12,000 rpm, 20 min), and the membrane proteins were resuspended in 60 μl of the same buffer. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin used as a standard. Membrane or cytosolic proteins (130 μg/lane) were resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and probed with a rabbit monoclonal antibody (1:100) directed against a 20-amino acid peptide of murine IL-11R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Detection of the antibody-antigen complex was achieved by the enhanced chemiluminescence procedure (ECL kit, Boehringer). Blots were used to expose X-Omat films (Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1 min to visualize immunoreactive bands. Confluent COS-7 cells (48 h after transfection) were scraped, pelleted, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5). Cells were lysed in 10 mm Tris/glycine buffer (pH 8.5) and 10 mmdithiothreitol by freezing and thawing once, followed by sonication for 2 min and centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. GALT activity was measured by the consumption of UDP-Glu according to published procedures (27Mellman W.J. Tedesco T.A. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1965; 66: 980-986PubMed Google Scholar). Curves were fitted using linear regression (Mathematica software, Wolfram Research Europe Ltd., Oxfordshire, United Kingdom). The human IL-11Rα gene has been widely studied, but its transcription start site and the 5′-untranslated region of the mRNA remained to be determined. To identify a cDNA containing the 5′-untranslated region, a probe corresponding to the human IL-11Rα cDNA was used to screen a placenta cDNA library. Three positive clones were obtained. The longest one, clone A11, was analyzed. Its sequence codes for the entire IL-11Rα protein. Surprisingly, this sequence was found to be fused to a part of the GALT cDNA sequence. Comparison of the A11 sequence with the GALT and IL-11Rα genomic sequences suggested that the mRNA corresponding to the A11 cDNA is the result of a particular splice event occurring between GALT exon 10 and IL-11Rα exon 2 (Fig. 1, inset). The absence of the last exon of GALT (exon 11) led to deletion of the 26 C-terminal amino acids of GALT in the putative fusion protein and eliminated the stop codon of GALT. Similarly, the absence of a 5′-untranslated region of IL-11Rα (exon 1) in A11, which could have introduced a stop codon or changed the reading frame, kept the nucleotide sequence in frame so that it also encoded a complete IL-11Rα protein. The 3′-end of GALT exon 10 was linked to IL-11Rα exon 2, which began in frame with the initiation codon. Thus, identification of the A11 cDNA suggests that transcripts encoding a GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα fusion protein, derived from the GALT and IL-11Rα proteins, may exist in human cells. However, at this stage, the possibility that the fusion resulted from a cloning artifact could not be eliminated. Mapping of both the GALT and IL-11Rα genes to human chromosome 9p13 suggested that the mRNA produced from A11 cDNA resulted from cotranscription and intergenic splicing of the GALT and IL-11Rα genes. To investigate this possibility, a cosmid library from human chromosome 9, LL09NC01, was screened with the A11 probe. The nine positive clones were further characterized. Hybridization with the labeled oligonucleotides Gal1 (GALT exon 1) and B9E (IL-11Rα exon 2) of positive clone DNA revealed that three clones contained both genes. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis restriction mapping of the clones and hybridization with oligonucleotides B23, B31, B22, and B14 as well as primers within the T3 and T7 Lawrist 16 vector arms revealed that the two genes were separated by 4 kb, giving a total genomic locus of 16 kb (Fig. 2). This supported the notion that the mRNA coding for the fusion protein GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα could be generated through a single process of RNA pol II transcription. To further confirm the existence of the intergenic transcripts, RT-PCRs were performed using primers designed to amplify the mRNA sequence spanning the junction region of the potential GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα intergenic transcript. Primers corresponding to the start codon portion of GALT (Gal1; Fig. 1) and IL-11Rα exon 3 (B4; Fig. 1) resulted in amplification of a 1203-base pair product, detectable by UV illumination and confirmed by Southern blotting, in five different cell types and in four different tissues. In normal cells, the intergenic transcripts were present at high levels in fetal bone marrow and at low levels in brain, liver, and small intestine. In cultured cells, the fusion transcript was highly expressed in T cell clones; moderately expressed in osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cells, neuroblastoma cell line SKNSH, and myeloma cell line RPMI 8226; and weakly expressed in histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 (Fig. 3). The nucleotide sequences of RT-PCR products were consistent with previous findings in the human placental cDNA clone A11. This demonstrated that this fusion mRNA was produced in normal tissues and cell lines and that the A11 cDNA resulted neither from a particular mutation or a genomic rearrangement within the individual from which the placenta cDNA library was generated nor from a cloning artifact. RNase protection analyses were performed to investigate whether the intergenic transcript is expressed as abona fide mRNA species in human cells (Fig. 4). An antisense RNA probe (366 nucleotides) was synthesized from a DNA template constructed by PCR using primer FG6 from GALT exon 10 and primer B4 from IL-11Rα exon 3 as indicated in Fig. 1. We expected to detect three fragments protected by this probe: the intergenic mRNA should protect a 266-nucleotide fragment, the IL-11Rα mRNA should protect a 142-nucleotide fragment, and the GALT mRNA should protect a 124-nucleotide fragment (Fig. 4 B). RNase protection analysis detected intergenic and GALT mRNAs in six different T cell clones (LT1–LT6) and in the osteosarcoma SAOS-2 cell line. IL-11Rα mRNA was detectable only in two T cell clones (LT3 and LT4) and in SAOS-2 cells (Fig. 4 A). These results were consistent with RT-PCR analysis. Relative quantification showed that the GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα transcripts in T cell clones represented ∼4% of GALT transcripts (average of six clones) and 150% of IL-11Rα transcripts (average of two clones). In SAOS-2 cells, intergenic transcripts comprised <3% of GALT transcripts and 10% of IL-11Rα transcripts. We used the GALT-protected fragment signal as an internal control of RNA quality and quantity; the level of the GALT-protected fragment in total RNA from K562 cells was too low to evaluate other protected transcripts. We thus proved that RNA pol II can transcribe, in human cells, two independent genes and produce a processed mRNA from this pre-mRNA via an intergenic splicing event. The fusion mRNA is produced at low levels, but higher than usually described for illegitimate transcription (28Chelly J. Concordet J.P. Kaplan J.C. Kahn A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2617-2621Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). In addition to this result concerning transcription by RNA pol II, we decided to analyze whether this phenomenon could play a role at the protein level. Based on their sequence, GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα transcripts may encode a fusion protein with multiple domains, the first consisting of the GALTΔ11 product followed by the signal peptide of IL-11Rα and the mature IL-11Rα chain with its Ig-like, cytokine receptor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. This hybrid molecule should contain two hydrophobic regions, raising questions about its folding and anchorage to the membrane. To examine these points, we performed Western blot analysis on total protein lysates (100–500 μg) from cells expressing fusion mRNA (T cell clones, T cell lymphoma-derived cell line Kit 225, and osteosarcoma cell line SAOS-2) and from COS-7 cells transfected or not with pKCSRα-IL-11Rα or pKCSRα-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα. Immunoblotting with an antibody raised against an N-terminal peptide from murine IL-11Rα detected only an 85-kDa protein in COS-7 cells expressing GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα (data not shown). Additional experiments with membrane or cytosolic protein lysates revealed that the 85-kDa protein is present in the membranous fraction of COS-7 cells expressing GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα and a doublet of 48 and 50 kDa is present in the membranous fraction of COS-7 cells expressing IL-11Rα (Fig. 5). These apparent sizes are consistent with the predicted molecular mass of the protein encoded by the GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα transcript (85 kDa) and our previous Western blot data using cell membrane lysates from Ba/F3 cells expressing IL-11Rα (18Lebeau B. Montero Julian F.A. Wijdenes J. Müller-Newen G. Dahmen H. Chérel M. Heinrich P.C. Brailly H. Hallet M.M. Godard A. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We checked that cell membrane lysates were equally loaded on the gel by immunoblotting with a high affinity-purified antiserum specific for the α-subunit of Gi2 (29Goldsmith P. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Unson C.G. Vinitsky R. Malech H.L. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14683-14688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the fusion mRNA is translatable to an 85-kDa GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα fusion protein that is produced as a membrane-associated protein detectable only in transfected cells. They also show that the fusion mRNA produces an 85-kDa protein that is not further processed by endoproteolytic cleavage of the signal peptide of IL-11Rα to generate a shorter protein that could be a functional IL-11Rα. We then investigated whether this fusion protein had both GALT and IL-11Rα activities. GALT activity of the fusion protein was unlikely because a stop codon mutation in the GALT gene, E340X (14 amino acids less than GALTΔ11), was reported in a galactosemic patient (30Gathof B.S. Sommer M. Podskarbi T. Reichardt J. Braun A. Gresser U. Shin Y.S. Hum. Genet. 1995; 96: 721-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This was confirmed by measuring GALT activity in whole cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with pKCSRα-GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα, pKCSRα-GALT, pKCSRα-GALTΔ11, or pKCSRα-IL-11Rα (Fig. 6). We detected no transferase activity in cells producing GALTΔ11 or GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα protein, whereas we did detect activity in cells producing GALT. Control experiments were performed with cells producing IL-11Rα. Similarly, the question arose as to whether the GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα protein would form a functional IL-11 receptor with gp130. We investigated this using the same approach we used to show that Ba/F3 cells producing both components of the IL-11 receptor complex,i.e. IL-11Rα and gp130, become IL-11-dependent (18Lebeau B. Montero Julian F.A. Wijdenes J. Müller-Newen G. Dahmen H. Chérel M. Heinrich P.C. Brailly H. Hallet M.M. Godard A. Minvielle S. Jacques Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 141-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed using GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα instead of IL-11Rα. We replicated this experiment three times, but were unable to get any IL-11-dependent cotransfected Ba/F3 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the fusion protein is not functional as a co-receptor. In conclusion, it appears that the results presented here strongly support the existence of a fusion mRNA, resulting from the cotranscription of two distinct genes and which codes for a putative fusion protein. The experiments we performed failed to detect the protein in the nontransfected cells and any activity in the transfected cells. The study of the IL-11Rα gene led us to identify a cDNA clone containing part of the GALT mRNA sequence linked in phase with the full IL-11Rα coding sequence. Based on RT-PCR and RNase mapping experiments, we established that significant amounts of the corresponding GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα fusion mRNA are present in normal human cells. These results demonstrate that RNA pol II complexes may cotranscribe two nearby unrelated genes in the human genome. Thus, two mRNAs are generated from the GALT promoter, a 1.4-kb mRNA encoding GALT and a 3-kb fusion mRNA encoding part of GALT and the entire IL-11Rα chain. The existence of the fusion transcript is probably due to leaky cleavage/polyadenylation at GALT poly(A) and an alternative splicing event between the GALT exon 10 donor splice site and the IL-11Rα exon 2 acceptor splice site. The biological significance of the fusion mRNA in human tissues remains to be established. The formation of fusion proteins by readthrough mechanisms is a recurrent phenomenon in the life cycle of several viruses. Such proteins are issued from translational readthrough of at least the stop codon of the first cistron (31Moore R. Dixon M. Smith R. Peters G. Dickson C. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 480-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Chin L.S. Foster J.L. Falk B.W. Virology. 1993; 192: 473-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transcription termination readthrough generating polycistronic mRNA is also frequent (33Wilde A. Morrison T. J. Virol. 1984; 51: 71-76Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dowling P.C. Blumberg B.M. Menonna J. Adamus J.E. Cook P. Crowley J.C. Kolakofsky D. Cook S.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1987-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Rima B.K. Baczko K. Clarke D.K. Curran M.D. Martin S.J. Billeter M.A. ter Meulen V. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 1971-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), but the first cistron is the only one to be translated in the absence of translational readthrough, as demonstrated for the paramyxoviruses (36Wong T. Hirano A. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 584-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This transcriptional readthrough could be mediated by cellular and viral factors (37Afzal M.A. Elliott G.D. Rima B.K. Orvell C. J. Gen. Virol. 1990; 71: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 38Hardy R.W. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 520-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and could participate in the regulation of gene expression (38Hardy R.W. Wertz G.W. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 520-526Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Maxfield L.F. Spector D.J. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8321-8329Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bousse T. Takimoto T. Murti K.G. Portner A. Virology. 1997; 232: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) as well as in the formation of fusion proteins. Furthermore, retroviruses seem to evolve using transcriptional readthrough to integrate cellular sequences close to the provirus (41Swain A. Coffin J.M. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6265-6269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, the structure of the transcription unit we identified is similar to the one found in the adenovirus major late promoter/E3 late transcription unit when dealing with mRNA formation. Within the numerous mRNAs initiated at the major late promoter, some of them spliced out exons containing poly(A) signal located before the E3 promoter and spliced to E3 gene exon 2 (42Bhat B. Wold W. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 54-63Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has not been reported that this process could generate a new fusion protein from two independent genes as described in this study. Furthermore, here we report transcriptional readthrough in the human genome. Up to now, the only data supporting such a mechanism in eukaryotic genomes came from the identification of a fusion transcript between the two genes MDS1 and EVI1, occurring in normal human tissues (43Fears S. Mathieu C. Zeleznik L.N. Huang S. Rowley J.D. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). In that work, quantitative experiments and analysis of putative fusion products were not addressed. As compared with viruses, we hypothesized for a role of the cotranscription process in the eukaryotic genomes. We first addressed this question at the protein level. Transfection experiments showed that this fusion mRNA is translated into an 85-kDa protein associated with a cell membrane, devoid of both expected biological activities; nevertheless, in nontransfected cells where the mRNA is present, such as T lymphocytes and T lymphoma, the hybrid protein is undetectable by Western blot analyses. It is important to consider that IL-11Rα is also undetectable by Western blotting in IL-11-responsive cells, and yet to date, the receptor chain was only identified using Scatchard plot analysis (44Yang Y.C. Yin T. Biofactors. 1992; 4: 15-21PubMed Google Scholar). In the same way, the fusion protein could be expressed at extremely low levels and have a novel function different from GALT and IL-11Rα biological activities. Another possibility is that the hybrid protein is not active and corresponds to an intermediary step in the generation of a new protein. Thus, this hybrid molecule contains two internal hydrophobic domains, raising the possibility that some nascent proteins fail to fold correctly and would be rapidly degraded in the endoplasmic reticulum (45Kopito R.R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar) before being addressed to a cell membrane. This view is supported by a lower expression of the fusion protein compared with a higher expression of IL-11Rα protein observed in three different transfection experiments. The fusion mRNA would then represent an exploratory event for evolution where a new protein is created and tested. It would be of interest to check whether this phenomenon is general in eukaryotic genomes, where recent physical mapping data indicate that many regions contain a high density of genes. If this is the case, one could speculate about whether there is a “second reading” of a genome where fusion proteins from independent genes are produced at low levels in cells. This reservoir of function could then be selected under particular conditions. In that case, inefficient RNA pol II termination, which contrasts with efficient RNA pol I and III termination, may have been selected during evolution, together with chromosome rearrangements, as a mechanism for generating new multidomain proteins. Furthermore, a single mutational event at the acceptor splice site or at the poly(A) signal of the last exon of the first gene could generate large amounts of a hybrid protein. Another possibility is that the fusion mRNA has a function by itself, not implicating the production of a fusion protein. We can hypothesize that the transcript elongation by RNA pol II could generate transcriptional interference with the IL-11Rα promoter. The GALT gene, which is strongly expressed in all cells, is located upstream from the IL-11Rα gene, which is expressed at low levels with strong tissue specificity. This generates a paradoxical situation in which RNA pol II complexes are continually progressing along the IL-11Rα promoter in all cell types, but very little, if any, IL-11Rα mRNA is produced. The peculiarity of RNA pol II termination could down-regulate IL-11Rα-specific transcription. Other studies demonstrated negative effects of one promoter on another for RNA pol I (46Bateman E. Paule M.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 985-992Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and for RNA pol II (47Cullen B.R. Lomedico P.T. Ju G.

The same phenomenon appears to be used by some viral genomes. Thus, the relative positions of genes in the genome could be an important element of gene regulation. In conclusion, we have demonstrated the production of a fusion GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα mRNA in human tissues and cell lines by a mechanism of cotranscription and intergenic splicing. This mRNA is translatable into a fusion protein (GALTΔ11/IL-11Rα) that is associated with the cell membrane. The proximity of GALT and IL-11Rα genes and the existence of a fusion mRNA will open the way for new investigation into galactosemic patients with chromosome 9p13 deletions. More generally, our results suggest that gene disposition throughout the genome, as well as transcription termination efficiency, has to be considered in gene expression studies. Cotranscription of flanking units may not be limited to the GALT/IL-11Rα locus and may be of general importance. We thank Dr. I. Corre for excellent technical assistance.

https://openalex.org/W2077704985,"Factor V (FV) is recently shown to express anticoagulant activity. It functions as a synergistic cofactor with protein S to activated protein C (APC) in the degradation of factor VIIIa (FVIIIa). FV is composed of multiple domains, A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2. Thrombin cleaves FV at Arg-709, Arg-1018, and Arg-1545 that leads to the generation of a procoagulant FV species which functions as a cofactor to factor Xa (FXa) in the activation of prothrombin to thrombin. During the activation process, the B-domain is released from the heavy (A1-A2) and light chains (A3-C1-C2) which constitute the active FV (FVa). To elucidate which effect the different thrombin cleavages in FV have on the ability of FV to express APC-cofactor activity, seven recombinant FV mutants containing all possible combinations of mutated and native thrombin cleavage sites were tested in a FVIIIa degradation assay. Thrombin cleavage at Arg-709 and/or Arg-1018 yielded FV molecules that were still able to function as APC cofactors, whereas cleavage at Arg-1545 led to a complete loss in APC-cofactor function. This suggests that the APC-cofactor function of FV depends on the B-domain remaining attached to the A3 domain. The importance of the FV B-domain for expression of APC-cofactor activity was further investigated using two B-domain deleted FV molecules, FV des-709–1545 (with the whole B-domain deleted) and FV des-709–1476 (with amino acids 710–1476 of the B-domain being removed). FV des-709–1476 expressed APC-cofactor activity, whereas the FV des-709–1545 was completely devoid of such activity. Thus, the C-terminal part of the B-domain (residues 1477–1545) was crucial for the APC-cofactor function. FV and factor VIII (FVIII) are homologous proteins having similar domain organization. A FV/FVIII chimera, harboring the B-domain from FVIII (FVBVIII) instead of the FV B-domain did not work as an APC cofactor, further illustrating the importance of the FV B-domain for the APC-cofactor function."
https://openalex.org/W2016675501,"Ligand-induced gene activation by nuclear receptors (NRs) is a complex process requiring dissociation of corepressors and recruitment of coactivators. The putative transcriptional intermediary factor TIF1α has been previously characterized as a nuclear protein that interacts directly with the AF-2 ligand-dependent activating domain present in the ligand-binding domain of numerous steroid and nonsteroid receptors, including the estrogen (ERα) and retinoid X (RXRα) receptors. We report here that TIF1α is both a phosphoprotein and a protein kinase. TIF1α coexpressed in COS-1 cells with RXRα or ERα is phosphorylated and becomes hyperphosphorylated upon ligand treatment. This hyperphosphorylation requires the binding of TIF1α to transcriptionally active NRs since it is prevented by mutations either in the core (α-helix 12 of the ligand-binding domain) of the AF-2 activating domains of RXRα and ERα or in the NR box of TIF1α that are known to prevent TIF1α-NR interactions. Thus, TIF1α is a phosphoprotein that undergoes ligand-dependent hyperphosphorylation as a consequence of nuclear receptor binding. We further show that purified recombinant TIF1α possesses intrinsic kinase activity and that, in addition to autophosphorylation, TIF1α selectively phosphorylates the transcription factors TFIIEα, TAFII28, and TAFII55 in vitro. These latter results raise the possibility that TIF1α may act, at least in part, by phosphorylating and modifying the activity of components of the transcriptional machinery.

Like other transcription factors, NRs display a modular structure with three main conserved regions: an N-terminal A/B region harboring an autonomous activation function (AF-1); a highly conserved C region encompassing most of the DNA-binding domain; and a C-terminal E region, which, in addition to a ligand-binding domain (LBD), contains a dimerization interface and a ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2). A well conserved amphipathic α-helix (helix 12) referred to as the AF-2 AD core has been identified in the C-terminal part of the E region and shown to be an essential element of the ligand-inducible AF-2 function (see Refs. 1Mangelsdorf D.J.

In this report, we demonstrate that TIF1α is a phosphoprotein that undergoes hyperphosphorylation upon interaction with liganded nuclear receptors in transfected cells. Moreover, TIF1α possesses intrinsic kinase activity responsible for autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of the transcription factors TFIIEα, TAFII28, and TAFII55 in vitro. These results suggest that hyperphosphorylation of TIF1α upon interaction with nuclear receptors, as well as phosphorylation of TFIIEα, TAFII28, and TAFII55 by TIF1α, might be instrumental in the control of transcription by nuclear receptors.

COS-1 cells grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal calf serum were transfected using the calcium phosphate technique and treated for 4 h with 10−7m estradiol (E2), 9C-RA, or 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) when indicated. Cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in nuclear isolation buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 7.9, 2 mm CaCl2, 85 mm KCl, and 5% sucrose) containing 0.3% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitor mixture.

J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) were purified by immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose and elution with reduced glutathione. In vitrophosphorylation reactions were performed with 5 ng of purified His-TIF1α in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 15 mmMgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP with or without substrate (0.5 μg) as indicated. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of Laemmli buffer and boiling. The phosphorylated proteins were subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue-stained, and autoradiographed. For in vivo phosphorylation, transfected COS-1 cells were starved overnight in phosphate-deficient medium and then incubated in the same medium for 4 h with 250 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate as described (33Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole cell or nuclear extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography and immunoblotting (33Rochette-Egly C. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Staub A. Pfister V. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 860-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunopurified His-TIF1α (50–500 ng) was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. After removing SDS from the gel by two washes in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing 20% isopropyl alcohol, proteins were denatured in buffer A containing 6 mguanidine and gradually renatured by a series of five incubations over a 16-h period at room temperature in buffer A containing 0.04% Tween 40. The gel was equilibrated for 1 h in kinase buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 30 mm KCl), and the phosphorylation reaction was performed in the same buffer with 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at room temperature. The gel was then extensively washed with 1% sodium pyrophosphate and 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried, and autoradiographed. The observation that TIF1α interacts with liganded NRs in vitro, but does not stimulate the AF-2 activity of NRs in transfected cultured cells (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), prompted us to examine the mechanism through which TIF1α might act. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with TIF1α in the presence or absence of RXRα or ERα and their respective ligands (10−7m 9C-RA and E2, respectively). The nuclear extracts from transfected cells were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with a TIF1α-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb4T). A single immunoreactive species with a molecular mass of ∼120 kDa (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), which is in agreement with the expected molecular mass of the TIF1α protein (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), was detected in cells transfected with TIF1α alone in the absence or presence of ligand. Interestingly, a fraction of TIF1α showed a pronounced decrease in its electrophoretic mobility in ligand-treated cells cotransfected with either ERα (Fig. 1 A, compare lanes 3 and 4) or RXRα (compare lanes 7 and 8). Thus, TIF1α could undergo a post-translational modification upon ligand-induced interaction with ERα or RXRα. Since phosphorylation often alters protein mobility during SDS-PAGE, we examined whether TIF1α, a serine-rich protein (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), could be phosphorylated. The above COS-1 cells nuclear extracts were treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase in the absence or presence of the phosphatase inhibitor sodium vanadate. Treatment with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase alone abolished both the RXRα/9C-RA- and ERα/E2- induced mobility shift of TIF1α (Fig. 1, B and C, comparelanes 1–3), whereas in the presence of vanadate, the slower migrating TIF1α species was unaffected (Fig. 1,B and C, lane 4). Thus, the interaction of TIF1α with the liganded nuclear receptors RXRα and ERα appears to promote phosphorylation of TIF1α. To support this possibility, transfected COS-1 cells coexpressing TIF1α and RXRα were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate in the absence or presence of 9C-RA, and nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with mAb4T. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and immunoblotting (Fig. 1 D). In the absence of RXRα and 9C-RA, TIF1α was weakly phosphorylated (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6). However, cotransfection of RXRα and treatment of the transfected cells with 9C-RA clearly induced hyperphosphorylation of TIF1α, resulting in a reduction of its electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1 D, lanes 4 and 8). Altogether, these results confirm that the liganded NR-induced TIF1α modification occurs through phosphorylation, as it is abolished by phosphatase treatment and is accompanied by an increase in32P labeling. To investigate whether the hyperphosphorylation of TIF1α was specific for ligands that induce AF-2 activity, similar experiments were performed with ERα in the presence of the anti-estrogen OHT. OHT is known to prevent ERα AF-2 activity in mammalian and yeast cells (34Berry M. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2811-2819Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar,35Metzger D. Losson R. Bornert J.M. Lemoine Y. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and to antagonize the E2-dependent interaction between the LBD of ERα and TIF1α (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In COS cells cotransfected with TIF1α and ERα, OHT failed to induce any upward shift of TIF1α (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 1 and3) and antagonized the shift induced by E2(compare lanes 2 and 4). This indicates that hyperphosphorylation of TIF1α requires the transcriptionally active conformation of the ERα holo-LBD that is required for interaction with TIF1α. It has been previously demonstrated in vitro and in yeast (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) that the ligand-dependent interaction of NRs with TIF1α requires the integrity of the core of the AF-2 AD (α-helix 12). Therefore, we investigated whether this integrity was required for TIF1α hyperphosphorylation. Cotransfection experiments were performed with TIF1α and RXRα either lacking the AF-2 AD core (RXRα-(Δ455–467)) or bearing amino acid substitution in the conserved hydrophobic residues (RXRα F455A/L456A and RXRα M459A/L460A) (23Le Douarin B.

Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type RXRα (Fig. 1 F, lanes 5 and 6), the RXRα deletion mutant (lanes 7 and 8) and the AF-2 AD core point mutants (lanes 9–12) failed to induce the characteristic mobility shift seen upon hyperphosphorylation. Similar amino acid mutations in the AF-2 AD core of ERα (ERα M543A/L544A) that prevent the interaction with TIF1α (22Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar) also eliminated the ERα/E2-induced modification of TIF1α (Fig. 1 C, compare lanes 5 and6 with lanes 1 and 2). These results, which are in agreement with the functional interactions detected both in yeast and in vitro (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 24vom Baur E. Zechel C. Heery D. Heine M.J.S. Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), demonstrate that TIF1α hyperphosphorylation induced by liganded RXRα or ERα requires the integrity of the AF-2 AD core (α-helix 12 of the LBD). The ligand- and AF-2 AD core-dependent TIF1α-NR interaction is also known to require the TIF1α NR box (amino acids 726 to 735) (22Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), and point mutations in this NR box (TIF1α L730A/L731A) abolish the binding of TIF1α to nuclear receptors (22Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To determine whether the TIF1α NR box was required for NR-induced modification of TIF1α, wild-type and mutant (L730A/L731A) TIF1α and RXRα expression vectors were cotransfected with RXRα in COS-1 cells with and without 9C-RA. Mutation of the NR box abolished TIF1α hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 2 and 5). The same results were obtained when COS cells were cotransfected with NR box mutant TIF1α and ERα and treated with E2 (data not shown). Thus, TIF1α hyperphosphorylation requires an intact NR box. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the phosphorylation of TIF1α, which occurs in the presence of liganded RXRα and ERα, exhibits the same requirements as those previously shown to be indispensable for the binding of TIF1α to the LBD of NRs. With the aim of identifying the kinase responsible for TIF1α phosphorylation, we produced recombinant His-TIF1α using a baculovirus expression vector in infected insect Sf9 cells and purified it to near homogeneity by DEAE-Sephadex followed by nickel chelate (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid) affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). After a series of high concentration salt washes, elution, and dialysis, purified TIF1α was tested in anin vitro kinase assay. TIF1α was phosphorylated without the addition of any other factors or kinase, suggesting that TIF1α might have an autokinase activity (Fig. 2 A, lanes 4 and 11). To eliminate the possibility that this kinase activity might be due to a copurifying contaminating kinase, an additional immunopurification step was performed. Purified His-TIF1α was immunoprecipitated using three different monoclonal antibodies (mAb1T, mAb2T, and mAb6T), each recognizing a different TIF1α epitope. His-TIF1α bound to the antibodies was washed extensively with 1 m KCl before elution with an excess of the cognate epitope peptide. The remaining supernatant (Fig. 2 A, Sn), the peptide eluate (E) containing TIF1α, and the eluted beads (Bd) were subjected to an in vitro kinase reaction and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Both the immunoprecipitation and elution steps were efficient (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1, 2, 5, 6, 8,and 9). Strikingly, TIF1α eluted from the three immunoprecipitates and incubated in the kinase reaction was phosphorylated (Fig. 2 A, lanes 3,7, and 10). Thus, after three purification steps (DEAE-Sephadex, nickel chelate, and immunoaffinity chromatography), His-TIF1α retained the ability to autophosphorylate. To eliminate the possibility that a copurifying kinase remained associated with TIF1α after these three purification steps, His-TIF1α eluted from mAb1T was resolved by SDS-PAGE and silver-stained. No contaminating polypeptides could be detected (Fig. 2 B). The resolved His-TIF1α was tested for autokinase activity in an in-gel kinase assay. Only one protein corresponding in size to His-TIF1α was phosphorylated (Fig. 2 C), thus ruling out the possibility that the phosphorylation of TIF1α could be due to a contaminating kinase. No signal was revealed in controls performed with uninfected or wild-type baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (data not shown), thus corroborating the specificity of our results. TIF1α does not possess any obvious well conserved domains typical of serine kinases. However, the Rossmann kinase ATP-binding motif GXGXXG, might be loosely conserved at amino acids 659–669 (GSRGSSGSSSK) of the TIF1α amino acid sequence (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). As TIF1α is very rich in serine and threonine residues (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar), further mutational analysis will be required to define the phosphorylated amino acids and to identify the kinase ATP-binding motif. We next investigated whether TIF1α could phosphorylate substrates other than itself. The first proteins to be tested were those known to interact directly with TIF1α, such as RXRα, ERα, HP1α, and MOD1 (HP1β) (22Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, 23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). None of the corresponding recombinant proteins were phosphorylated by purified TIF1α in anin vitro kinase assay (data not shown). To investigate whether TIF1α could phosphorylate ERα and RXRα in a cellular environment, COS-1 cells cotransfected with TIF1α and either ERα or RXRα were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and, after disruption, were immunoprecipitated with ER or RXR antibodies. The phosphorylation of ERα was induced by estradiol (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 5 and 6). However, this phosphorylation was not affected by overexpression of either wild-type TIF1α (lanes 1 and 2) or TIF1α mutated in the NR box (lanes 3 and 4). Similarly, TIF1α did not affect the level of phosphorylation of RXRα, even in the presence of 9C-RA (Fig. 3 B). TIF1α is a putative transcriptional intermediary factor for nuclear receptors (22Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P.

Therefore, the ability of TIF1α to phosphorylate recombinant transcription initiation factors such as TFIIAαβ, TFIIAγ, TFIIEα, TFIIEβ, TBP, TAFII135, TAFII20, TAFII18, TAFII28, and TAFII55 (31Dubrovskaya V.

J. 1995; 14: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) was investigated in vitro (Fig. 4 A) (data not shown). Among these factors, only TFIIEα and the TBP-associated factors TAFII28 and TAFII55 were phosphorylated by immunopurified recombinant His-TIF1α (Fig. 4 A,lanes 6, 12, and 14). However, no stable interaction of TIF1α with these factors could be found (data not shown), as previously observed with other known components of the general transcriptional machinery (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M. Lutz Y. Tora L. Pierrat B. Heery D. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2020-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). TIF1α was originally identified as a transcriptional intermediary factor on the basis of its direct ligand-dependent interaction with NRs in vitroand in vivo (23Le Douarin B. Zechel C. Garnier J.M.

Garnier J.M. Vivat V. Le Douarin B. Gronemeyer H. Chambon P. Losson R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 110-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Results from our laboratory have provided evidence supporting the idea that TIF1α may control, at least in part, transcription by NRs through chromatin remodeling (22Le Douarin B. Nielsen A.L. Garnier J.M. Ichinose H. Jeanmougin F. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6701-6715Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that TIF1α undergoes hyperphosphorylation that is dependent on direct interaction with a nuclear receptor upon binding of the cognate ligand. We also demonstrate that TIF1α possesses an intrinsic kinase activity as it autophosphorylates and phosphorylates transcription factors such as TFIIEα, TAFII28, and TAFII55 in vitro. Thus, TIF1α is both a phosphoprotein and a protein kinase."

Despite its high homology (89%) to 3A23, CYP3A2 is only weakly induced by glucocorticoids (23Tehlada M.B. Pereira T.M. Lechner M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Cooper K.O. Reik L.M. Jayyosi Z. Bandiera S. Kelley M. Ryan D.E. Daniel R. McCluskey S.A. Levin W. Thomas P.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 301: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). CYP3A23 is expressed at low levels in untreated animals but is highly inducible by glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, and by PCN, a synthetic steroid with no hormonal activity (16Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Thotassery J.V. Guzelian P.S. Strom S. Sun D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 63-72PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schuetz E.G. Wrighton S.A. Barwick J.L. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1999-2006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Results from nuclear run-on experiments have established that the response is transcriptional (23Tehlada M.B. Pereira T.M. Lechner M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,26Simmons D.L. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 326-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of CYP3A protein by glucocorticoids was shown to be unusual in comparison to other glucocorticoid-responsive genes, such as tyrosine aminotransferase (5Heuman D.M. Gallagher E.J. Barwick J.L. Elshourbagy N.A. Guzelian P.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1981; 21: 753-760Google Scholar, 27Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2007-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One prominent difference was that a 100-fold greater concentration of dexamethasone was required to elicit a maximal CYP3A response than was required for tyrosine aminotransferase induction. Also, PCN antagonized the glucocorticoid induction response of tyrosine aminotransferase while acting as a strong CYP3A inducer (27Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2007-2012Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, other characteristics of the response are typical of glucocorticoid-inducible genes, such as specificity for glucocorticoids and inhibition by the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist RU38486 (25Schuetz E.G. Wrighton S.A. Barwick J.L. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1999-2006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Burger H.-J. Schuetz J.D. Schuetz E.G. Guzelian P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1992; 89: 2145-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). It has been determined, though, that the region supporting dexamethasone responsiveness does not bind GR, which excludes direct GR-mediated transactivation of the gene (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 31Quattrochi L.C. Mills A.S. Barwick J.L. Yockey C.B. Guzelian P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28917-28923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previous characterization by this laboratory of the CYP3A235′-flanking region localized the glucocorticoid response to the −60 to −170 region (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This segment contained three nuclear protein binding sites as demonstrated by in vitro footprinting analysis and conferred responsiveness onto a heterologous promoter. The distal-most site, DexRE-1, has a core sequence ofAACTCAAAGGAGGTCA, an imperfect direct repeat of an AGGTCA hexamer with a spacing of four nucleotides between the motifs (DR4). The AGGTCA sequence is a characteristic core binding motif of the class of nuclear receptors that includes the receptors for thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, retinoic acid, and 9-cis-retinoic acid, and the orphan receptors (32Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar, 33Enmark E. Gustafsson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Mutations that disrupted either the upstream or downstream hexamer or their spacing caused a drop in dexamethasone induction, whereas changing the site to match a perfect direct repeat enhanced the response (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This suggested that a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, although not GR, was acting through the DexRE-1 element. The two additional sites within this region, designated DexRE-2 and Site A, were also implicated in the dexamethasone induction pathway (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DexRE-2 (−118 to −136) contains an AGTTCA repeat with a nucleotide spacing of three (DR3), differing at two positions from a consensus nuclear receptor binding site. Its role relative to the other two sites was not determined in previous studies. The proximal site, Site A, displays strong homology to a hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) consensus binding site (34Chen D. Park Y. Kemper B. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 771-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). HNF-4 directs liver-specific expression of numerous genes, including several cytochrome P450 genes (35Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar). In the current study, Site A was examined for its role in mediating basal expression and/or dexamethasone responsiveness. Our studies to date provide strong evidence that the dexamethasone response of CYP3A23 is driven by a multisite mechanism. In the present study, DexRE-2 and Site A were characterized and found to be crucial for full glucocorticoid responsiveness ofCYP3A23. In addition, we demonstrated that functional activity at all three sites (DexRE-1, DexRE-2, and Site A) was correlated with ability to bind proteins from H4IIE nuclear extracts. Furthermore, we demonstrated through gel shift analyses that the orphan receptor chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) binds at DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 and, by cotransfection experiments, that Site A corresponds to a functional HNF-4 site. Hence, glucocorticoids induce CYP3A23 transcription through a multisite unit that encompasses binding sites for members of the nuclear receptor superfamily. Oligonucleotides used for both mutagenesis procedures and for gel shift reactions were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Polymerase chain reactions were performed using the GeneAmp kit and Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer). Restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and T4 polynucleotide kinase were obtained from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Radioactive isotopes [α-35S]dATP (1000Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]dATP (3000Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Luciferase assay reagents were from Promega (Madison, WI). Mutagenesis was performed on the wild-type 3A23 deletion construct P3–210. Construction of the DexRE-1 mutants Δ155–158, DR3, and DR4 has been previously reported (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Changes were made by the polymerase chain reaction overlap extension technique using complementary mutant oligonucleotides as internal primers and oligonucleotides annealing to the pGL2-Basic vector as the external primers (36Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction products were cut with SacI/HindIII, and the fragments were subcloned into the pGL2-Basic vector containing the luciferase reporter gene (Promega). All constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy-chain termination method with the Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit as described by the manufacturer (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). H4IIE rat hepatoma cells, obtained from H. Pitot (McArdle Laboratory), were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2. HeLa cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmid DNA for transfection experiments was purified using Qiagen Maxi-prep columns (Santa Clarita, CA) followed by phenol/CHCl3 extraction. H4IIE transfections were performed by overlaying a 1-ml mixture of 6 μg/ml plasmid DNA, 75 μg/ml DEAE-dextran, 25 mm Tris, and 50% serum-free Dulbecco's minimum essential medium onto subconfluent H4IIE cells that had been plated 24 h prior to transfection. After 6 h of incubation in transfection mixture, cells were shocked for 2 min with 10% Me2SO in phosphate-buffered saline followed by 64–66 h incubation in medium containing 10 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) or Me2SO. HeLa cells were transfected using 10 μg/ml Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 6 h followed by addition of 10% fetal calf serum containing Dulbecco's minimum essential medium to halt the transfection. Unless otherwise specified, 3 μg/ml of luciferase reporter DNA and 0.01 μg/ml of cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmids were used in the co-transfection experiments. Cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Activity was measured using a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence, Cockeysville, MD) and is expressed as relative light units/100 μg of protein. Fold induction by dexamethasone corresponds to the ratio of relative light units/100 μg of protein for dexamethasone-treated to relative light units/100 μg of protein for Me2SO-treated cells. Protein determination was made according to a modified Lowry method. Double-stranded DNA for probes was generated by annealing complementary, single-stranded oligonucleotides for DexRE-1 (5′-CCCAGAATGTTAACTCAAAGGAGGTCAAAATAGGCTG-3′, 5′-AGCCTATTTTGACCTCCTTTGAGTTAACAT-3′), DexRE-2 (5′-TGTAGATGAACTTCATGAACTGTCTAGG-3′), and Site A (5′-GGAAGAGAGTACCAAAGTCCACGTGAGG-3′) (exact reverse complementary oligonucleotides were used for opposite strands of DexRE-2 and Site A). Other pertinent sequences are provided in the figures. DNA (2–4 pmol) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and unincorporated nucleotides were removed by Sephadex G-50 filtration. Binding reactions contained 12 mmHepes, 4 mm Tris, 12% glycerol, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of dI-dC, 5–7 μg of H4IIE crude nuclear extract, and 0.05 pmol of probe (20,000 cpm). In competition reactions, excess unlabeled oligonucleotide was preincubated (10 min) at room temperature before being incubated with probe for an additional 10 min. For supershift reactions, antiserum to COUP-TF or HNF-4 (1:5 dilution), generously provided by M.-J. Tsai and F. M. Sladek, respectively, was added to reactions and incubated on ice for 15 min before addition of probe. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The activity of DexRE-1 mutants positively correlates with their affinity for nuclear binding proteins. The sequence of theCYP3A23 dexamethasone-responsive region is shown in Fig. 1. The heavy lines over each of the three regions indicate sequences protected in DNase I footprinting analysis (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), and the consensus sequences highlighted in boldface for DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 are imperfect AGGTCA direct repeats (indicated by arrows) with four- and three-nucleotide spacing, respectively. Also shown aligned with CYP3A23 is the homologous region of theCYP3A2 gene. Within this region of the two promoters, the genes are 91% identical, but the promoters differ in the magnitude of their response to glucocorticoids (23Tehlada M.B. Pereira T.M. Lechner M.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 298: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It is likely that mismatches between CYP3A23 and 3A2, indicated (Fig. 1) by vertical dashes between the aligned sequences, are responsible for their differential inducibility. In this study, several mutants were constructed for the analysis of DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 based on these mismatches. Previously, it was demonstrated that dexamethasone activation could be reduced or enhanced depending on the specific changes made to the degenerate DR4 of DexRE-1 (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, binding studies were not performed to determine whether changes in DexRE-1 activity were associated with alterations in binding to nuclear factors. To examine this point, analyses were performed using several DexRE-1 mutants that displayed either strongly decreased or enhanced dexamethasone responsiveness in transient transfection experiments in H4IIE rat hepatoma cells (Fig. 2). In the P3–210(3A2) mutant, DexRE-1 of the 3A23 gene was converted to the corresponding element of the 3A2 gene. These changes resulted in an approximate 60% decrease in the dexamethasone response compared with the wild-type, P3–210. The maximum induction response observed for any CYP3A2 promoter-driven reporter construct is 3–4-fold; 2J. M. Huss and C. B. Kasper, unpublished observation. therefore, these results indicate that divergence in DexRE-1 sequence betweenCYP3A23 and 3A2 is, in part, responsible for the differential responsiveness of the two genes. In addition, 6-fold induction was observed for the spacing mutant, P3–210(Δ−155 to −158), whereas only a 3-fold response to dexamethasone was seen for P3–210(−149 to −154), in which the downstream hexamer was disrupted. Hence, modification of the downstream AGGTCA inactivated DexRE-1, because mutants completely lacking DexRE-1 still displayed a partial (3-fold) induction response (30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that conversion of the imperfect AGGTCA direct repeat of DexRE-1 to a perfect consensus DR4 or DR3 resulted in dexamethasone induction greater than that of wild-type (Ref. 30Huss J.M. Wang S.I. Astrom A. McQuiddy P. Kasper C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1996; 93: 4666-4670Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar and Fig. 2 A). Binding analyses of both decreased and enhanced activity mutants are shown in Fig. 2 B. In the competition gel shift assays, DexRE-1 was used as probe, and binding was competed with increasing amounts of unlabeled wild-type or mutant double-stranded oligonucleotides. DexRE-1 formed two DNA-protein complexes with H4IIE nuclear extracts (Fig. 2 B, lane 2), designated A and B, that were eliminated upon incubation with excess cold self (lanes 3 and 4). Most notable was the observation that the decreased activity mutants (Δ−155 to −158 and −149 to −154) did not compete for the formation of complex B (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7, 8, and 12–14), even up to 150–200-fold excess of mutant DNA. However, both mutants successfully competed for complex A formation. The Δ−155 to −158 mutant was equivalent to wild-type (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 4 and 7), whereas −149 to −154 displayed reduced affinity, because 50-fold excess mutant (lane 12) competed as efficiently as 10-fold wild-type for complex A (lane 4). The enhanced activity DR4 was as effective as wild-type in competing for both complexes A and B (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 9 and 3). Hence, a correlation exists between activity and binding to DexRE-1, although formation of complex A was less affected by changes in spacing or the downstream hexamer than was complex B. Our previous studies showed that two consensus sites, DexRE-1 and DexRE-2, cooperated to mediate glucocorticoid induction of the CYP3A23 gene. DexRE-2, which spans nucleotides −118 to −136, contains an AGTTCA direct repeat separated by three nucleotides and bears two mismatches with the corresponding element of the less responsive CYP3A2 gene (Fig. 1). Fig. 3 A shows the effects of altering the sequence of DexRE-2 on both basal and induced activity of the P3–210 construct. The C-T mismatches between CYP3A2 andCYP3A23 at positions −117 and −127 were changed individually in P3C-117T and P3C-127T, respectively. The downstream substitution caused a moderate decrease in dexamethasone inducibility, whereas the mutation at −127 had no effect. In contrast, mutations that decreased the spacing between direct repeats or disrupted either the upstream or downstream motif virtually eliminated the glucocorticoid induction response. The most active mutant of this type was P3−122 to −124, which retained only a 2.2-fold induction response to dexamethasone. Interestingly, none of the DexRE-2 mutations resulted in any significant change in basal activity, suggesting that this element plays an important role in glucocorticoid induction but does not contribute to basal gene expression. The relative binding characteristics of each mutant element were assessed by competition gel shift assays (Fig. 3 B). DexRE-2 formed a single specific complex with extracts from H4IIE cells that was eliminated upon addition of cold self (lane 3). A positive correlation was observed between glucocorticoid responsiveness and binding affinity. Whereas low activity mutants −131 to −133 and −122 to −124 displayed reduced affinity for the protein(s) binding to DexRE-2 (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 3, 4, and7), point mutants that retained significant activity displayed binding affinities equivalent to that of wild-type (comparelanes 3, 5, and 6). These data demonstrate that the direct repeat core is the essential component of DexRE-2, which when mutated results in the reduction in both functional activity and protein binding affinity. Gel shift analyses of DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 using H4IIE nuclear extract were performed to compare patterns of specific complex formation at the respective sites (Fig. 4). As observed above, DexRE-1 formed two DNA-protein complexes (A and B), and DexRE-2 formed the expected single complex. When the two probes were analyzed on the same gel, it became apparent that the DexRE-2 complex migrated at the same mobility as the DexRE-1 complex A (lanes 2 and 8), suggesting that the sites might be interacting with a common protein(s). To test this possibility, reciprocal competition gel shift experiments were performed using DexRE-1 as probe and excess cold DexRE-2 as competitor, and vice versa. Interestingly, both sites appeared to bind the same protein(s). DexRE-2 efficiently competed for binding with DexRE-1, but only for complex A, whereas cold DexRE-1 completely eliminated DexRE-2 complex formation when added at a 50-fold excess. Therefore, DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 can bind to a common factor(s), although the results indicate that DexRE-2 has a higher affinity for the factor(s) than DexRE-1. Next, experiments were performed to identify the protein(s) present in complex A. When DexRE-2 sequence was compared with reported nuclear receptor binding sites, an extension of the DR3 was found to closely match a consensus element that binds both orphan receptors, COUP-TF and HNF-4. The DexRE-2 sequence, CAGTTCAtgAAGTTCA, differs by one nucleotide from the consensus element, which consists of an 5′-(A/G)(A/G)G(G/T)TCA-3′ heptamer direct repeat (mismatch in boldface) (37Kimura A. Nishiyori A. Murakami T. Tsukamoto T. Hata S. Osumi T. Okamura R. Mori M. Takiguchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11125-11133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although considerable sequence overlap exists between HNF-4 and COUP-TF response elements, not all HNF-4 binding sites bind COUP-TF (35Sladek F.M. Tronche F. Yaniv M. Liver Gene Expression. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1994: 207-230Google Scholar); therefore, to distinguish between these two possible binding activities for DexRE-2, several oligonucleotides specific for either COUP-TF or HNF-4 were used in competition gel shift experiments with DexRE-2 probe (Fig. 5 A). TREpal and TREpal12 are idealized palindromic arrangements of GGTCA separated by 0 and 12 nucleotides, respectively, that specifically bind with COUP-TF but not HNF-4 (38Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The COUP oligonucleotide corresponds to the natural COUP-TFI binding site found in the chicken ovalbumin promoter and comprises a DR2 (39Pastorcic M. Wang H. Elbrecht A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2784-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides competed with labeled DexRE-2 for complex formation as would be predicted if COUP-TF were the binding protein (Fig. 5 B). That is, competition by TREpal and COUP, both of which are specific high affinity COUP-TF binding sites, was comparable to that of wild-type DexRE-2 (Fig. 5 B, compare lanes 3, 4, and 8), whereas the low affinity site, TREpal12, only decreased DexRE-2 binding when present at 50-fold excess (lane 7). Finally, the α1-antitrypsin element from the α1-antitrypsin gene that specifically binds HNF-4 but not COUP-TF proteins was unable to compete with DexRE-2 (Fig. 5 B, lanes 10–12). The same experiment was performed with DexRE-1, and an identical pattern of competition was observed for complex A, providing further support that DexRE-1 and DexRE-2 bind to the same protein (data not shown).

The single β-γ cross-link was obtained by removal of the δ subunit from F1 and then treating with CuCl2 as described previously (Aggeler, R., Haughton, M. A., and Capaldi, R. A. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 9185–9191). The mutant enzyme, βE381C, had an increased overall rate of unisite hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP compared with the wild type ECF1 due to increases in the rate of ATP binding (k +1), Pi release (k +3), and ADP release (k +4). Release of bound substrate ([γ-32P]ATP) was also increased in the βE381C mutant. Cross-linking between Cys-381 and the intrinsic Cys-87 of γ caused a further increase in the rate of unisite catalysis, mainly by additional effects on nucleotide binding in the high affinity catalytic site (k +1 and k +4). In δ-subunit-free ECF1 from wild type or βE381C F1, addition of an excess of ATP accelerated unisite catalysis. After cross-linking, unisite catalysis of βE381C was not enhanced by the cold chase. The covalent linkage of γ to β increased the rate of unisite catalysis to that obtained by cold chase of ATP of the noncross-linked enzyme. It is concluded that the conversion of Glu-381 of β to Cys induces an activated conformation of the high affinity catalytic site with low affinity for substrate and products. This state is stabilized by cross-linking the Cys at β381 to Cys-87 of γ. We infer from the data that rotation of the γ/ε rotor in ECF1 is not linked to unisite hydrolysis of ATP at the high affinity catalytic site but to ATP binding to a second or third catalytic site on the enzyme.

Five of these subunits (α3, β3, γ1, δ1, ε1) are located outside the membrane in the catalytic F1 portion. The other three subunits (a1, b2, c9–12) form a channel that transports protons through the membrane (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev.

How catalytic site events are coupled to proton translocation is only now beginning to be understood.It had been shown several years ago that the γ and ε subunits undergo conformational changes in F1F0 upon membrane energization (4Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Richter M.L. McCarty R.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14275-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and that they shift their positions between the α and β subunits of soluble F1 in response to nucleotide binding (7Gogol E.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been established conclusively that these movements represent rotation of a domain formed by the γ and ε subunits (10Duncan T.M. Bulygin V.V. Zhou Y. Hutcheon M.L. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 11Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Such rotation has been visualized directly during ATP hydrolysis in the soluble F1 (12Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 13Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar) and is inferred by cross-linking studies of the hydrolytic and synthetic reaction when catalyzed by the whole F1F0 complex (11Aggeler R. Ogilvie I. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Zhou Y. Duncan T.M. Cross R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10583-10587Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).As yet, no correlation has been established between the rate of rotation of the γ-ε domain and the kinetics of individual steps in the ATP hydrolysis or synthesis reactions. However, the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme is almost fully inhibited by cross-linking either γ or ε, or both subunits, to α or β subunits through engineered disulfide bonds (8Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.-X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 9Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), thereby confirming the direct linkage between catalytic site events and rotation. The driving force for this rotation in the direction of ATP hydrolysis could be the binding energy of ATP and/or the free energy change associated with the ATP splitting reaction. However, complicating any analysis, ATP can bind in three catalytic sites that are characterized by high, medium, and low affinities for nucleotides (1Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar, 2Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 15Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3877-3879Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 16Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11261-11268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a priori, binding in any of these sites could drive the rotation.To some extent, the functioning in these sites can be differentiated because ATP hydrolysis in the high affinity catalytic site can be monitored by so-called “unisite” catalysis measurements (17Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is distinguished from nucleotide binding into low affinity sites which accelerates product release from the first site, as in cold chase experiments (18Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unisite catalysis is measured with substoichiometric amounts of [γ-32P]ATP in relation to F1 and is characterized by a highly exergonic ATP binding step (K 1), a reversible ATP hydrolysis/synthesis equilibrium that occurs with a negligible change in free energy (K 2), and a very slow product release step which is rate-limiting (k +3 andk +4) (see Equation 1 and review in Ref. 19Penefsky H.S. Cross R.L. Adv. Enzymol. 1991; 64: 173-214PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if subunit rotation is coupled to unisite catalysis, ATP binding in the high affinity site would be the most probable driving force (20Al-Shawi M.K. Parsonage D. Senior A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4402-4410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic steps of the unisite catalytic cycle are as follows. F1+ATP⇌k−1k+1F1·ATP⇌k−2k+2F1·ADP·Pi⇌k−3k+3 F1·ADP+Pi⇌k−4k+4F1+ADPEquation 1 Here, we measure unisite catalysis in ECF1 in which the γ subunit has been cross-linked to a β subunit to prevent rotation. Our results are interpreted to indicate that ATP binding at a catalytic site other than the high affinity site, drives the rotation of the γ and ε domain.RESULTSECF1 from the mutant βE381C was used in the present study. The properties of this mutant have been described in detail elsewhere (21Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Cross-linking in essentially full yield can be obtained between Cys-381 of β and the intrinsic Cys-87 of the γ subunit. The effect of this cross-linking is to inhibit multisite ATPase activity as reported before (21Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and confirmed here. In the present study, the effects of the cross-linking on unisite catalysis have been examined. The kinetics of ATP hydrolysis in a single high affinity catalytic site was measured using [γ-32P]ATP, and the effect of a large excess of ATP as a “cold chase” on this kinetics was studied. This so-called cold chase examines the effect of ATP binding at a second and/or third catalytic site on the kinetics of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis in the first, highest affinity site.In ECF1, the promotion of unisite ATP hydrolysis by excess ATP is maximized in enzyme from which the δ subunit has been removed (35Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This may have to do with non-physiological binding of the δ subunit in isolated ECF1 (21Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that the δ subunit is a two domain protein (41Wilkens S. Rodgers A. Olgivie I. Capaldi R.A. Biophys. Chem. 1997; 68: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 42Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In ECF1F0, the N- and C-terminal domains interact with each other (43Zeigler M. Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4233-4239PubMed Google Scholar, 44Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), whereas in isolated ECF1, the C-terminal domain can swing away to interact with the DELSEED region of a β subunit (21Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This is evident from the observed cross-linking from βE381C to the intrinsic Cys-140 of γ shown previously and confirmed here (Fig. 1).A selective removal of the δ subunit was accomplished by gel filtration of ECF1 in the presence of LDAO as described fully under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 1 shows the separation of the subunits of intact ECF1 and δ-free enzyme from βE381C by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Removal of δ was obtained without a significant loss of the ε subunit, c.f. lanes 3 and 1. Fig. 1 also shows cross-linking of ECF1 from the mutant βE381C induced by incubation with 200 μm CuCl2 (lanes 2 and4). Removal of the δ subunit not only prevents non-physiological reactions of this subunit, but facilitates interpretation of experiments because the only cross-linked product observed in significant amounts is now between β-γ. Therefore, the fixing of these two subunits can be correlated directly with the observed effects.In the presence or absence of the δ subunit, multisite or cooperative ATPase activity was inhibited by 97–98% in different experiments, in comparison with control samples treated with the equivalent levels of CuCl2, but with 5 mm DTT present. This inhibition was at roughly the same level as the yield of cross-linking.The removal of the δ subunit had very little effect in the rate of acid quench-measured unisite hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP in either wild type or mutant-(βE381C) ECF1, as reported previously (35Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and see Table I. Fig. 2 compares the rates of unisite catalysis of wild type ECF1 and βE381C, both before and after cross-linking. The rates of unisite catalysis by wild type ECF1 are comparable with those obtained by others under similar experimental conditions (35Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12954-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); see Table I for rate constants of catalysis. As evident in Fig. 1, the substitution of Cys for Glu-381 in the mutant βE381C significantly increased the rate of unisite ATP hydrolysis of ECF1, and this rate is increased more dramatically after cross-linking of the Cys at position 381 of β with Cys-87 of the γ subunit.Figure 2Effect of CuCl2 induced cross-linking on the unisite catalysis of βE381C ECF1after removal of the δ subunit. Unisite hydrolysis of 0.05 μm [γ-32P]ATP by 0.5 μmECF1 was measured as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” The circles show the amount of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolyzed by the βE381C F1 in the presence (•—•) and in the absence (○—○) of 5 mm DTT. For comparison, the same experiment was made with the wild type ECF1 (×—×). For the reactions measured in the presence of NaN3 (▵—▵), ECF1 was preincubated with this inhibitor for 10 min before starting the experiment. The experimental points are the average of triplicate measurements. All reactions were stopped by an acid quench at the times shown by the experimental points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Before making a detailed kinetic analysis of the unisite activity of the βE381C mutant, the possible contribution of multisite activity in the present experiments was examined by testing the effect of sodium azide (NaN3). NaN3 is an inhibitor which effectively blocks multisite ATPase activity of F1-ATPases without significant effect on unisite catalysis, presumably by affecting catalytic site cooperativity (36Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previous studies had suggested that cooperative or multisite catalysis could contribute even when ratios of [γ-32P]ATP to F1 of 0.3 mol/mol were used (38Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Bullough D.A. Allison W.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although cross-linking itself inhibits the multisite catalysis, this control is still relevant because small amounts of noncross-linked enzyme are present and could be providing all of the [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis being observed. However, as shown in Fig. 2, NaN3 at concentrations that completely blocked multisite catalysis in noncross-linked enzyme (results not shown; Refs. 36Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 213: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar and 37Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 974: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) had no effect on the rates of unisite catalysis after cross-linking. Taken together, the above results confirm that the ATP hydrolysis being followed occurs in the so-called “high affinity” catalytic site in the cross-linked enzyme.Table I lists the rate and equilibrium constants that were measured. In relation to wild type ECF1, the rate of ATP binding (k +1) is faster for the βE381C mutant both before and after cross-linking. Also, [γ-32P]ATP release was faster in the mutant by a factor of 25 before cross-linking and more than 100-fold after cross-linking. The result is a 10-fold decrease in the affinity for ATP. As indicated in Table I, the mutant showed a more than 20-fold increase in k +3, the rate of Pi release, which was not enhanced greatly by cross-linking. The cross-linking also increased the rate of ADP release from the mutant ECF1. Table I also listsK 2 measured for the different preparations. This equilibrium constant was not greatly affected in the mutant with or without cross-linking.The effect of a cold chase of excess ATP on unisite catalysis for the wild type and mutant is shown in Fig. 3. There was the expected burst of [γ-32P]ATP hydrolysis after addition of cold ATP in the wild type ECF1 and in enzyme from the mutant without cross-linking. However, after cross-linking, the rate of unisite catalysis carried out by the βE381C mutant was by itself as fast as the accelerated unisite catalysis of the noncross-linked mutant. Unisite catalysis of the βE381C mutant was also much faster than the promoted and non-promoted unisite catalysis carried out by the wild type enzyme, which is limited by the rate of [γ-32P]ATP binding (Fig. 3).Figure 3Acceleration of unisite catalysis in β-γ cross-linked βE381C ECF1 (-δ). The unisite catalysis of the βE381C F1(-δ) was measured at a [γ-32P]ATP/F1 ratio of 0.1. In the presence of 5 mm DTT, nonpromoted unisite catalysis (•—•) was stopped by the standard acid quench. Promoted unisite catalysis (○—○) was measured by adding a volume of 10 mm MgATP to ECF1 undergoing unisite catalysis and allowing the reaction to proceed 2 s further during rapid mixing before adding the acid. The open circles indicate the time at which the reactions were stopped. The same procedure was used to measure the promoted (▵—▵) and non-promoted (▴—▴) unisite catalysis of the βE381C F1 (-δ) previously cross-linked between β and γ subunits. For comparison, the figure also shows the promoted (+····+) and non-promoted (×····×) unisite catalytic activity of wild type ECF1 (-δ). For the wild type ECF1, promoted experimental data are plotted at the time of addition of the cold chase, but the reactions were stopped 1 min later, the same results were obtained if the cold chase reactions of the wild type ECF1 were stopped after 2 or 5 s. Bound [γ-32P]ATP (⋄—⋄) was also measured in parallel for the wild type enzyme by the hexokinase trap method.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the mutant βE381C, a cross-link can be obtained between β and γ subunits in essentially full yield. Previous studies made in ECF1 from the triple mutant βY331W:βE381C:εS108C (39Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32623-32628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have established that binding of ATP to this cross-linked F1 is similar to that of noncross-linked enzyme,i.e. there is one high affinity binding site (K d = 90–200 nm), a loose site (K d = 2–7 μm), and a weak binding site (K d = 40–50 μm). The results here show that enzyme cross-linked between β (at Cys-381) and γ (at Cys-87) retains a high affinity catalytic site with aK d for ATP in the nanomolar range (Table I). At the same time, cooperative multisite ATPase activity is essentially lost after cross-linking. Taken together, these results indicate that negative cooperativity of nucleotide binding and positive cooperativity of multisite ATPase activity need not be coupled to each other.In novel labeling studies using laser-induced covalent incorporation of 2-azido-ATP, we have established a direct relationship between nucleotide binding affinity and the different interactions between γ and ε subunits with the three β subunits (15Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3877-3879Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The site with highest affinity is in that β subunit which has neither of the smaller subunits cross-linked to it (βfree), the loose binding site is in that β which cross-links with ε, and the weak site is in the β which cross-links to γ (15Grüber G. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3877-3879Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This relationship can only be retained during enzyme turnover if nucleotide binding in at least one β subunit, with the associated conformational changes that must occur, results in the movement of the γ-ε subunit domain from one α/β pair to the next. A priori, the movements of γ and ε could be due to binding in any of the three catalytic sites. The studies described here were directed toward asking whether nucleotide binding in the highest affinity catalytic site, bond cleavage in this site, or substrate binding in a second or third catalytic site, drives the rotation of γ/ε.It was found that the mutation of Glu-381 of the DELSEED region of β to a Cys (without any cross-linking) led to altered unisite catalysis by ECF1. This mutation increased the overall rate of unisite catalysis significantly by affecting both substrate and product binding. The most dramatic effect was on ATP release rate which was 30-fold faster than that for wild type enzyme. ATP binding (k +1) was also increased, and there was a more than 20-fold increase in the rate of Pi release. Fig. 4 compares the unisite rate constants for βE381C and those for two mutations in the γ subunit. The γT106C mutation also increased k +1 while both this mutation and the change of Met-23 of γ to a Lys affectedk +3. In fact, for the mutant γM23K,k +3 was twice as fast again as for the DELSEED mutation. Structural studies show that Met-23 of γ interacts with the DELSEED region of one of the three β subunits. This is a different β subunit from that which forms the disulfide bond with Cys-87 of γ studied here. Clearly, the interaction of the DELSEED region of two different β subunits with γ has a similar and direct effect on catalysis in the highest affinity site, as would be expected if γ subunit binding is determined and/or is a determinant of nucleotide binding affinities.Figure 4Comparison of rate constants of unisite catalysis of βE381C, γT106C, and γM23K mutants. This figure compares the rate constants of unisite catalysis affected by the βE381C mutation and by cross-linking, with those previously reported for the γT106C and γM23K mutations. The data for these other two mutants were taken from Refs. 6Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14275-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar and 40Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12954-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Cross-linking between β and γ subunits of the mutant βE381C which inhibits multisite catalysis by 97%, was found to further increase the rate of unisite catalysis to the point that the reaction was essentially over within the first few seconds under the standard conditions used here. Curve fitting was used to analyze the kinetics of unisite catalysis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Good fits (S.E. ≤ 20% in the constants fitted) were obtained for wild type enzyme and for mutant, giving values of 0.71 and 0.33 (wt) and 0.84 and 0.84 (βE381C) respectively for k +2and k –2. These values are similar to those reported earlier for wild type enzymes (35Xiao R. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19232-19237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Al-Shawi M.K. Nakamoto R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12954-12960Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) but lower than those of the γT106 mutation (6Turina P. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14275-14280Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Turina P. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13465-13471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presumably due to the differences introduced by this mutation and/or its labeling with a fluorescent probe. The kinetics of unisite catalysis after cross-linking of βE381C was so fast that no satisfactory fit could be obtained (S.E. ≥ 50% in k +2 and k –2), therefore it remains unclear if cross-linking alters these two rate constants.As shown in Fig. 3, the effect of covalently linking βCys-381 to γCys-87 is to increase the rate of unisite catalysis to that of non-cross-linked enzyme obtained with a cold chase of ATP. After cross-linking, the ATP cold chase did not increase the observed rate of unisite catalysis. The implication is that ECF1 from the mutant βE381C is in a conformation facilitating the rapid release of nucleotide and Pi that occurs on substrate binding in a second or third site. This conformation is then stabilized by cross-linking. A similar activation of the high affinity catalytic site can be obtained in Rhodospirillum rubrumF1-ATPase in the presence of Ca2+, but in this case, multisite ATPase activity is also enhanced (45Maldonado E. Dreyfus G. Garcı́a J.J. Gómez-Puyou A. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to determine if these activated states are structurally similar.The rapid rate of bond cleavage of ATP to ADP + Pi in enzyme in which the γ subunit is covalently linked to a β subunit indicates that rotation of the γ/ε subunit domain is not driven by, and does not require, nucleotide binding, or bond cleavage, in the high affinity catalytic site. Additional testing requires that methods such as those employed by Sabbert et al. (12Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) or Noji et al. (13Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1940) Google Scholar) for demonstrating rotation of the γ subunit are adapted to unisite conditions.An absence of rotation of the γ/ε subunits driven by ATP binding or bond cleavage in the high affinity catalytic site does not necessarily rule out that these reactions drive the coupling of ATP hydrolysis (or synthesis) to proton translocation. Conformational changes induced by ATP hydrolysis within the high affinity catalytic site could be transmitted to the c subunit ring and result in translocation of protons without rotation of the γ/ε/c subunit ring domain (presently, the favored model of energy transduction within the ATP synthase (10Duncan T.M.

Instead, rotation could realign the molecule after each catalytic site-driven proton translocation event for the next turnover to proceed. In this connection, it is interesting that conformational changes have been observed by fluorescent probes attached at positions 8 and 106 of the γ subunit which correlate with unisite catalysis (6Turina P.

https://openalex.org/W2073644084,"The nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of purified native URA7-encoded CTP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2, UTP: ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was characterized. CTP synthetase existed as a dimer in the absence of ATP and UTP. In the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP and UTP, the CTP synthetase protein existed as a tetramer. Increasing concentrations of ATP and UTP caused a dose-dependent conversion of the dimeric species to a tetramer. The kinetics of enzyme tetramerization correlates with the kinetics of enzyme activity. The tetramerization of CTP synthetase was dependent on UTP and Mg2+ ions. ATP facilitated the UTP-dependent tetramerization of CTP synthetase by a mechanism that involved the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of UTP catalyzed by the enzyme. The glutaminase reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme was not required for enzyme tetramerization. CTP, a potent inhibitor of CTP synthetase activity, did not inhibit the ATP/UTP-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme. Phosphorylation of the purified native CTP synthetase with protein kinase A and protein kinase C facilitated the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization. Dephosphorylation of native CTP synthetase with alkaline phosphatase prevented the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme. This correlated with the inactivation of CTP synthetase activity. Rephosphorylation of the dephosphorylated enzyme with protein kinase A and protein kinase C resulted in a partial restoration of the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme. This tetramerization correlated with the partial restoration of CTP synthetase activity. Taken together, these results indicated that enzyme tetramerization was required for CTP synthetase activity and that enzyme phosphorylation played an important role in the tetramerization and regulation of the enzyme.

The kinetics of enzyme tetramerization correlates with the kinetics of enzyme activity. The tetramerization of CTP synthetase was dependent on UTP and Mg2+ ions. ATP facilitated the UTP-dependent tetramerization of CTP synthetase by a mechanism that involved the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of UTP catalyzed by the enzyme. The glutaminase reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme was not required for enzyme tetramerization. CTP, a potent inhibitor of CTP synthetase activity, did not inhibit the ATP/UTP-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme. Phosphorylation of the purified native CTP synthetase with protein kinase A and protein kinase C facilitated the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization. Dephosphorylation of native CTP synthetase with alkaline phosphatase prevented the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme. This correlated with the inactivation of CTP synthetase activity. Rephosphorylation of the dephosphorylated enzyme with protein kinase A and protein kinase C resulted in a partial restoration of the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme. This tetramerization correlated with the partial restoration of CTP synthetase activity. Taken together, these results indicated that enzyme tetramerization was required for CTP synthetase activity and that enzyme phosphorylation played an important role in the tetramerization and regulation of the enzyme. The nucleotide CTP is required for the synthesis of RNA, DNA, phospholipids, and sialoglycoproteins (1Stryer L. Biochemistry. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1995Google Scholar). CTP is synthesized from UTP via the reaction catalyzed by the cytosolic-associated enzyme CTP synthetase (EC 6.3.4.2, UTP: ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)) (2Liberman I. J. Biol.

In eukaryotic cells, the regulation of CTP synthetase activity plays an important role in the balance of nucleotide pools (4Aronow B. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Moreover, unregulated CTP synthetase activity is a common property of leukemic cells (12van den Berg A.A. van Lenthe H. Busch S. de Korte D. Roos D. van Kuilenburg A.B.P. van Gennip A.H. Eur. J.

Overall, these observations emphasize the importance of studies to understand the regulation of CTP synthetase activity. Our laboratory utilizes the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeas a model eukaryote to study the regulation of CTP synthetase activity. The yeast enzyme is encoded by the URA7 (7Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O.

The mechanism of stimulation by each of these protein kinases is the same and includes an increase in the V max, a decrease in the K m for ATP, and a decrease in the positive cooperative kinetics of the enzyme with respect to ATP (17Yang W.-L.

The phosphorylation of the purified CTP synthetase by protein kinase A and protein kinase C also causes a decrease in the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by CTP (17Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J.

Although the effects of both protein kinases on CTP synthetase are the same, phosphopeptide mapping experiments have indicated that the protein kinase A and protein kinase C sites on the enzyme differ (17Yang W.-L.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase has one potential target site for protein kinase A and eight potential target sites for protein kinase C. Results of labeling experiments under growth conditions that regulate the activities of protein kinase A and protein kinase C indicate that the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase is mediated by these protein kinases in vivo (17Yang W.-L.

Ligand-induced oligomerization of an enzyme is a major mechanism for the regulation of its activity (20Traut T.W. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 29: 125-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In this work, we examined the requirements and the kinetics of the ligand-induced tetramerization of the URA7-encoded CTP synthetase. Our studies also revealed that the phosphorylation of CTP synthetase by protein kinase A and protein kinase C played a significant role in the tetramerization and activation of the enzyme. Nucleotides, adenylyl imidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), 1The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenylyl imidodiphosphate. l-glutamine, alkaline phosphatase-agarose, molecular mass standards for gel filtration chromatography, and bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Protein kinase A catalytic subunit (bovine heart) and protein kinase C (rat brain) were purchased from Promega. Protein assay reagent and molecular mass standards for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were purchased from Bio-Rad. Reagents for electrophoresis were purchased from National Diagnostics. Superose 6 was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. URA7-encoded CTP synthetase was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate fractionation of the cytosol followed by chromatography with Sephacryl 300 HR, Q-Sepharose, Affi-Gel Blue, and Superose 6 (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The specific activity of the pure enzyme was 2.5 μmol/min/mg. Purified CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinase A as described previously (17Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28777-28783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) using the bovine heart catalytic subunit. The bovine heart protein kinase A catalytic subunit is structurally and functionally identical to the S. cerevisiae protein kinase A catalytic subunit (21Toda T. Cameron S. Sass P. Zoller M. Wigler M. Cell. 1987; 50: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). CTP synthetase was phosphorylated with protein kinase C as described previously (18Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using a rat brain preparation of the enzyme. Rat brain protein kinase C phosphorylates and activates CTP synthetase in the same manner as that of purified protein kinase C isolated from S. cerevisiae(19Yang W.-L. Bruno M.E.C. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The protein kinase A and protein kinase C preparations used in our studies were judged to be essentially pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Native purified CTP synthetase was dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase attached to beaded agarose (18Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14983-14988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A Superose 6 column (1 × 24 cm) attached to a Pharmacia FPLC system was equilibrated and eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mml-glutamine, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm GTP in the absence and presence of the indicated concentrations of ATP and UTP at 5 °C. The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000 (for the void volume), thyroglobulin (669 kDa), apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). Purified CTP synthetase was incubated in the Superose 6 chromatography buffers (0.1 ml total volume) for 5 min and then applied and eluted from the Superose 6 column at a flow rate of 15 ml/h. Fractions (0.47 ml) were collected and analyzed for CTP synthetase protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature (Lond.). 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed with 10% slab gels. Molecular mass standards were phosphorylase b (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), and soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa). Proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gels were stained with silver (23Merril C.R. Dunau M.L. Goldman D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 110: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The density of the CTP synthetase bands on SDS-polyacrylamide gels was quantified by scanning densitometry. CTP synthetase activity was determined by measuring the conversion of UTP to CTP (molar extinction coefficients of 182 and 1520m−1 cm−1, respectively) by following the increase in absorbance at 291 nm on a recording spectrophotometer (3Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm UTP, 2 mm ATP, 2 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm GTP, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and an appropriate dilution of enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Enzyme assays were performed in triplicate with an average standard deviation of ±3%. All assays were linear with time and protein concentration. A unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzed the formation of 1 μmol of product/min. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations using the EZ-FIT Enzyme Kinetic Model Fitting Program (25Perrella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The oligomeric forms of CTP synthetase were analyzed by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography followed by the quantification of column fractions by scanning densitometry of silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. In contrast to measuring activity (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), the measurement of CTP synthetase protein permitted the identification of inactive oligomeric forms of the enzyme. We examined the effects of the substrates and cofactors used for the CTP synthetase reaction (Fig. 1) on the tetramerization of the purified native enzyme. CTP synthetase catalyzes the conversion of UTP to CTP in two sequential steps (26Koshland Jr., D.E. Levitzki A. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1974: 539-559Google Scholar, 27von der Saal W. Anderson P.M. Villafranca J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14993-14997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the first step, UTP is phosphorylated with ATP to form 4-phospho-UTP via an ATPase reaction. The second step involves a glutaminase reaction where glutamine is converted to glutamate and NH3. The NH3 generated in the glutaminase reaction combines with the phosphorylated UTP to form CTP. GTP activates the reaction by accelerating the formation of a covalent glutaminyl enzyme catalytic intermediate (3Long C.W. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Levitzki A. Koshland Jr., D.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Mg2+ ions are required to form metal ion-nucleotide complexes during the enzyme reaction (29Robertson J.G. Villafranca J.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In experiments to examine the dependence of specific reaction components on enzyme tetramerization, each of the other reaction components were present at saturating concentrations. In the absence of ATP and UTP, all of the CTP synthetase protein eluted from the Superose 6 column at a position consistent with the dimeric form of the enzyme (Fig. 2, panel A and Fig. 3). When the enzyme was chromatographed in the presence of saturating concentrations of ATP (2 mm) and UTP (2 mm), nearly all of the total CTP synthetase protein eluted at a position consistent with the tetrameric form of the enzyme (Fig. 2, panel C and Fig. 3). When subsaturating concentrations of ATP (0.8 mm) and UTP (0.1 mm) were used in the gel filtration experiment, 30% of the total CTP synthetase protein eluted as a tetramer and 70% of the total protein eluted as a dimer (Fig. 2, panel B). These data showed that under optimal assay conditions (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), all of the CTP synthetase existed as a tetramer. However, under suboptimal assay conditions (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), CTP synthetase existed as both tetrameric and dimeric species. The data in Fig. 2 also showed that the Superose 6 column efficiently separated the dimeric and tetrameric forms of the enzyme. UTP was absolutely required for the tetramerization of the CTP synthetase protein when ATP was present at a concentration of 2 mm (Fig. 3). In the absence of UTP, all of the enzyme existed in the dimeric form. On the other hand, ATP was not required for the tetramerization of CTP synthetase when UTP was present at a concentration of 2 mm. Under these conditions, 38% of the total CTP synthetase protein existed as a tetramer (Fig. 3). Thus, ATP facilitated the UTP-dependent tetramerization of the CTP synthetase protein.Figure 3The effects of substrates and cofactors on the tetramerization of CTP synthetase. Purified CTP synthetase (50 μg) was subjected to Superose 6 chromatography in the absence and presence of 2 mm ATP, 2 mm UTP, 2 mm glutamine (Gln), 0.1 mm GTP, and 10 mm MgCl2 as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The oligomeric forms of CTP synthetase were quantified as described in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We examined whether the substrate glutamine and the activator GTP were required for the ATP/UTP-dependent tetramerization of CTP synthetase. For this experiment, the purified enzyme preparation was exhaustively dialyzed to remove glutamine, a component of the buffer used to purify the enzyme (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The absence of glutamine and GTP from the gel filtration chromatography buffer did not have a significant affect on the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme (Fig. 3). About 90% of the total CTP synthetase protein existed as a tetramer under these conditions. These results indicated that the glutaminase reaction was not required for the tetramerization of the CTP synthetase protein. The effect of Mg2+ ions on the tetramerization of the enzyme was examined. In the absence of Mg2+ ions, all of the CTP synthetase existed as a dimer (Fig. 3). This result correlated with the Mg2+ ion requirement for CTP synthetase activity (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and was consistent with the requirement of magnesium-nucleotide complexes for the tetramerization of the enzyme. We examined the effect of enzyme concentration on tetramerization using saturating concentrations of ATP and UTP. Varying the concentration of CTP synthetase between 0.1 to 1 mg/ml protein did not affect the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme (data not shown). If the tetramerization of CTP synthetase is in fact a mechanism of enzyme regulation in vivo, then tetramerization should be reversible. We examined this hypothesis in vitro. The purified enzyme was incubated with saturating concentrations of each substrate and cofactor to induce full tetramerization. The tetrameric enzyme was then dialyzed exhaustively to remove the substrates and cofactors and the enzyme was subjected to gel filtration chromatography in the absence of ATP and UTP. Indeed, the tetramerization of the CTP synthetase protein was reversible. All of the CTP synthetase protein eluted from the column as a dimer (data not shown). URA7-encoded CTP synthetase activity exhibits positive cooperative kinetics with respect to ATP and UTP when measured with subsaturating and saturating concentrations of UTP and ATP, respectively (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10785-10793Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 17Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11113-11119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This cooperative kinetic behavior is presumably because of the nucleotide-dependent tetramerization of the enzyme (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T.

To further explore this hypothesis, we examined the dependence of CTP synthetase tetramerization on ATP and UTP. In these experiments, the concentrations of glutamine, GTP, and Mg2+ ions were maintained at saturating concentrations of 2 mm, 0.1 mm, and 10 mm, respectively. At subsaturating (0.1 mm) and saturating (2 mm) concentrations of UTP, the tetramerization of the CTP synthetase protein was dependent on ATP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, A andB, respectively). At 0.1 mm UTP the maximum amount (60%) of tetramer formed was at 1.2 mm ATP (Fig. 4 A), whereas at 2 mm UTP the maximum amount (93%) of tetramer formed was at 0.4 mm ATP (Fig. 4 B). The kinetics of tetramerization correlated in general with the kinetics of CTP synthetase activity (9Yang W.-L. McDonough V.M. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Adeline M.-T. Flocco M.T. Carman G.M.

TheV max and K m values with respect to ATP at 0.1 mm UTP are 2.11 units/mg and 1.44 mm, respectively (17Yang W.-L. Carman G.M. J. Biol.

Similarly, at subsaturating (0.5 mm) and saturating (2 mm) concentrations of ATP, the tetramerization of CTP synthetase was dependent on UTP in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4, C and D, respectively). Moreover, tetramerization of the enzyme was absolutely dependent on UTP. At both subsaturating and saturating concentrations of ATP, maximum tetramerization was obtained at 0.3 mm UTP. However, the maximum amount of tetramer present at 2 mm ATP was 92%, whereas the maximum amount of tetramer present at 0.5 mmATP was 50%.

https://openalex.org/W2038847945,"This study evaluated whether human monocyte-derived macrophages synthesize specific types of proteoglycans with lipoprotein-binding capability that could contribute to lipid retention in the arterial wall. After labeling with either [35S]SO4 or [35S]methionine, macrophages secreted a high molecular mass proteoglycan, with glycosaminoglycan chains of ∼18 kDa and core protein bands of ∼100 and 55 kDa. Both core protein bands were recognized by an antibody to PG-100, an antibody that recognizes the proteoglycan form of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PG-100/PG-MCSF). The interaction between PG-100/PG-MCSF and low density lipoproteins (LDL) was examined by gel mobility shift. In this system, PG-100/PG-MCSF was resolved further into two forms. The two forms had the same core proteins but differed in their overall size and glycosaminoglycan content. The larger form contained glycosaminoglycan chains that were entirely chondroitin ABC lyase-sensitive, whereas the smaller form contained chains that were sensitive to both chondroitin ABC lyase and heparinase. Both forms bound native LDL with high affinity, but the larger form bound LDL with higher affinity than the smaller form. The glycosaminoglycan chains of PG-100/PG-MCSF, but not the core proteins, were responsible for binding to native LDL. Mildly oxidized LDL and methyl-LDL, which have an electrophoretic charge similar to that of native LDL, also bound PG-100/PG-MCSF. In contrast, extensively oxidized LDL and acetyl-LDL, which are more electronegative than native LDL, did not bind to either form of PG-100/PG-MCSF. The demonstration of two forms of human monocyte-derived macrophage PG-100/PG-MCSF which bind LDL may represent an additional role for macrophages in the extracellular trapping of lipoproteins in atherosclerosis.

The demonstration of two forms of human monocyte-derived macrophage PG-100/PG-MCSF which bind LDL may represent an additional role for macrophages in the extracellular trapping of lipoproteins in atherosclerosis. The monocyte-derived macrophage is an important cell in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (1Libby P. Clinton S.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In addition to its ability to phagocytose large amounts of lipid, the macrophage is capable of secreting many factors that contribute to lesion development. Included among these secreted factors are proteoglycans (2Kolset S.O. Gallagher J.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 191-211PubMed Google Scholar), which are a heterogeneous group of molecules that have the common structure of a core protein to which glycosaminoglycan chains are covalently attached. The interactions of proteoglycans with other macromolecules in the arterial wall can affect numerous processes, including vascular permeability, hemostasis, thrombosis, and lipoprotein metabolism (3Wight T.N. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wight T.N. Kinsella M.G. Qwarnström E.E. Curr. Opin.

Heart J. 1990; 11: 148-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoglycan-lipoprotein interaction, leading to lipoprotein retention in the arterial intima, has been hypothesized to be the major cause of extracellular lipid accumulation within atherosclerotic lesions (6Williams K.J. Tabas I. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 551-561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proteoglycan-mediated extracellular lipid accumulation has a number of important biological consequences, including increased susceptibility of lipoproteins to oxidation (9Hurt-Camejo E. Camejo G. Rosengren B. López F. Ahlstrom C. Fager G. Bondjers G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 569-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), increased lipoprotein aggregation (5Camejo G. Hurt-Camejo E. Olsson U. Bondjers G. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 385-391Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and rapid internalization of lipoprotein-proteoglycan complexes by both macrophages (10Vijayagopal P. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells (11Ismail N.A. Alavi M.Z. Moore S. Atherosclerosis. 1994; 105: 79-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). All of these events potentially can contribute to foam cell formation and development of atherosclerotic lesions. To date, much of the understanding of arterial proteoglycan structure and function has been derived from studies of arterial smooth muscle cell proteoglycans. However, less is known about the proteoglycans secreted by monocyte-derived macrophages, which also could contribute to proteoglycan-mediated lipid retention and foam cell formation in the arterial wall. For example, macrophages from other sources, such as cholesterol-enriched pigeon peritoneal macrophages and P388D1 macrophage-like cells, synthesize proteoglycans that can bind low density lipoproteins (LDL) 1The abbreviations used are: LDL, low density lipoprotein; HMDM, human monocyte-derived macrophages; N-LDL, native LDL; PG-MCSF, proteoglycan form of macrophage colony-stimulating factor; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Arteriosclerosis. 1988; 8: 535-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the differentiated THP-1 macrophage cell line synthesizes cell surface proteoglycans that bind lipoprotein lipase (15Edwards I.J. Xu H. Obunike J.C. Goldberg I.J. Wagner W.D. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 400-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which has been shown to enhance the binding of LDL to extracellular matrix proteoglycans of the arterial wall (16Edwards I.J. Goldberg I.J. Parks J.S. Xu H. Wagner W.D. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1155-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although these studies have not identified specific types of proteoglycans, they have suggested that the deposition of these proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix by macrophages may play an important role during atherogenesis. The overall goal of this study was to determine whether or not human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) synthesize specific types of proteoglycans with lipoprotein binding capability that could contribute to lipid retention in the arterial wall. We demonstrate that HMDM synthesize and secrete two major proteoglycan forms that differ in size, glycosaminoglycan composition, and affinity for native LDL (N-LDL). Both forms bind LDL with high affinity. The larger form contains only chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and binds to N-LDL with higher affinity than the smaller form, which contains chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Further, the predominant component of these secreted proteoglycans is identified as the proteoglycan form of the growth factor macrophage colony-stimulating factor (PG-MCSF). The finding that HMDM secrete a novel proteoglycan with lipoprotein-binding capability suggests an additional role for the macrophage in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Human monocytes were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation by the method of Böyum (17Böyum A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1968; 21: 77-99PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (18Heinecke J.W. Suits A.G. Aviram M. Chait A. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1991; 11: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% autologous serum containing 2 mmglutamine (2 × 106 cells/35-mm dish). Cells were fed twice weekly for 8–10 days by which time they were differentiated into macrophages (19Edelson P.J. Cohn Z.A. Bloom B.R. David J.R. In Vitro Methods in Cell-mediated and Tumor Immunity. Academic Press, New York1976: 333-340Google Scholar). Monocyte-derived macrophages were metabolically labeled with either 50 μCi/ml 35SO4- or35S-labeled methionine (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in fresh medium for 48 h. Labeled medium was harvested, and protease inhibitors (0.1 m 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5 mmbenzamidine HCl, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radiolabeled cell layer was harvested with 8m urea buffer, 0.25 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, containing protease inhibitors (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human and monkey vascular smooth muscle cells were isolated from the thoracic aorta by the explant method and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum, as described previously (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cells were metabolically labeled with 50 μCi/ml 35SO4 in fresh medium for 48 h. Labeled medium was harvested with protease inhibitors. Medium from metabolically labeled macrophage cultures or smooth muscle cells was applied to DEAE-Sephacel minicolumns equilibrated in 8 m urea buffer, 0.25m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 and were eluted with 8m urea buffer containing either 3 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, or a gradient of 0.25–1 m NaCl (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This ion exchange chromatography step served to remove free radiolabel and to concentrate proteoglycan samples. 35SO4-Labeled proteoglycans were resolved further by agarose gel electrophoresis and characterized.35SO4-Proteoglycans were applied to a single wide lane of an agarose gel and electrophoresed for 7 h at 60 V and 4 °C. A portion of the gel was sliced into 0.5-cm segments for scintillation counting and location of the proteoglycan species. The proteoglycan species that were resolved by this method were cut out of the agarose, which then was melted and diluted 10-fold with 8m urea buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.25m NaCl. The diluted agarose was reconcentrated on DEAE-Sephacel minicolumns, and proteoglycans were eluted with 8m urea buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 3m NaCl (21Schönherr E. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). 35SO4-Proteoglycan and [35S]methionine-labeled core protein molecular sizes were characterized by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions according to the procedure of Laemmli (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 27: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207192) Google Scholar). Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains were removed by digestion with 0.03 unit/ml chondroitin ABC lyase (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) in 0.3 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 18 mmsodium acetate with protease inhibitors for 3 h at 37 °C (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains were removed by digestion with 20 units/ml heparinase I (Sigma) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10 mm calcium acetate, and 18 mm sodium acetate with protease inhibitors for 3 h at 37 °C followed by the addition of 20 units/ml heparinase II (Sigma) and incubation for overnight at 41 °C (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled intact proteoglycans and core proteins (after enzyme digestion) were visualized by fluorography of dried gels treated previously with Enlightning™ (NEN Life Science Products) and exposed to Kodak XAR-2 film at −70 °C. The hydrodynamic size of35SO4-proteoglycans was analyzed on Sepharose CL-4B (0.7 × 73 cm) and CL-6B (0.7 × 63 cm) molecular sieve columns equilibrated in 8 m urea buffer with 0.5% Triton X-100 (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fractions of 1 ml were collected, and an aliquot of each fraction was assayed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting. The elution position of free 35SO4was used as a marker for the total volume (Vt). Glycosaminoglycan chains were released from proteoglycans by reductive β-elimination with 1 m sodium borohydride in 50 mm NaOH for 4 h at 45 °C (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by neutralizing the sample with glacial acetic acid. Glycosaminoglycan chains then were applied to a Sepharose CL-6B column (0.7 × 63 cm) in 0.2m Tris, pH 7.0, with 0.2 m NaCl for analysis of chain length by size exclusion chromatography (23Wasteson Å. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). The elution position of free 35SO4 was used a marker for the Vt). Core proteins of chondroitin ABC lyase- or heparinase I- and II-digested samples were separated on SDS-PAGE 4–12% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes at 20 V for 70 min in 40 mm Tris, 50 mm glycine with 20% methanol and 0.0375% SDS in a semidry electrophoretic transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 2% calf serum in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antiserum prepared against recombinant human versican (1:1,000 in blocking buffer) (kindly provided by Dr. R.

Nitrocellulose membranes were washed with 0.1% calf serum in TBST before incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antiserum (1:2,000 dilution in TBST with 0.1% bovine serum albumin) (Boehringer Mannheim) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the membranes were developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce) and visualized by fluorography on Kodak XAR-2 film. LDLs were isolated from plasma of normal human volunteers as described previously (27Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). In brief, LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) was separated from normal human plasma by preparative ultracentrifugation in a Beckman VTi 50 vertical rotor (28Chung B.H. Wilkinson T. Geer J.C. Segrest J.P. J. Lipid Res. 1980; 21: 284-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and purified by sequential density gradient ultracentrifugation (27Heinecke J.W. Baker L. Rosen H. Chait A. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). N-LDL was oxidized in the presence of copper by incubation of LDL (300 μg/ml) in the presence of 5 μm copper sulfate for 4 h at room temperature (mildly oxidized LDL) or 18 h at 37 °C in air (extensively oxidized LDL) (29Esterbauer H. Striegl G. Puhl H. Rotheneder M. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1989; 6: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (1687) Google Scholar). LDL was acetylated as described (30Chait A. Henze K. Mazzone T. Jensen M. Hammond W. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 721-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In brief, LDL (1–3 mg/ml) in 0.15 m NaCl, with 0.01% EDTA, was added to an equal volume of a saturated sodium acetate solution with continuous stirring on ice, after which four 1.5-μl aliquots of acetic anhydride were added every 15 min (acetyl-LDL). Reductive methylation of LDL was performed as described (31Weisgraber K.H. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 9053-9062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 1 mg of sodium borohydride and 5 μl of 7.4% aqueous formaldehyde were added to 6–10 mg of LDL. Additional 5-μl aliquots of formaldehyde were added every 6 min for 30 min (methyl-LDL). The reaction was stopped by dialysis against 0.15m NaCl, with 0.01% EDTA. The extent of modification was assessed by measuring thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (32Buege J.A. Aust S.D. Methods Enzymol. 1978; 52: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (10812) Google Scholar), trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid reactivity, and electrophoretic mobility (30Chait A. Henze K. Mazzone T. Jensen M. Hammond W. Metabolism. 1982; 31: 721-727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Binding of LDL to proteoglycans, glycosaminoglycans, or core protein was measured using a modification (33Camejo G. Fager G. Rosengren B. Hurt-Camejo E. Bondjers G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14131-14147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of a gel mobility shift assay developed for assessing the binding of proteins to DNA (34Rezvin A. BioTechniques. 1989; 7: 346-355PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μl of 35SO4-proteoglycans,35SO4-glycosaminoglycans, or [35S]methionine-core proteins (in 10 mmHepes, pH 7.2, with 140 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm CaCl2), were mixed with 10 μl of increasing concentrations (0–1 mg/ml) of N-LDL or modified LDL in the same buffer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. 3 μl of glycerol:bromphenol blue (1:1 v/v) was added to the samples, and 20 μl was loaded into wells of Nu-Sieve (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, ME) agarose gels (0.7% in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, with 2 mm CaCl2 and 4 mmMgCl2). Samples were electrophoresed for 3 h at 60 V 4 °C with buffer recirculation. The gels were fixed with 0.1% cetyl pyridinium chloride in 70% EtOH for 2 h, air dried, and analyzed by autoradiography. In this system, free35SO4-proteoglycans migrate toward the front of the gel, whereas 35SO4-proteoglycans complexed to lipoproteins remain near the origin of the gel. Autoradiograms were scanned with a Hewlett-Packard Scan Jet IIcx using ImageQuant software. Binding constants were determined from quantification of free35SO4-proteoglycans migrating at the front of the gel with SAAM II software using Michaelis-Menten equations (SAAM Institute, Seattle). The distribution of newly synthesized proteoglycans into the medium and cell layer of macrophage cultures was determined from the yields of 35SO4-labeled medium in the two compartments after ion exchange chromatography. The majority (∼75%) of the newly synthesized proteoglycans appeared in the medium after a 24-h label, whereas ∼25% was associated with the cell layer. HMDM 35SO4-labeled medium was applied to DEAE-Sephacel and eluted with a 0.25–1 m NaCl gradient. Secreted 35SO4-labeled material eluted as a single peak at 0.5 m NaCl (Fig. 1), which is approximately the same concentration of NaCl required to elute the proteoglycans secreted by arterial smooth muscle cells in culture (20Schönherr E. Jarvelainen H.T. Sandell L.J. Wight T.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17640-17647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elution profile of35SO4-labeled material associated with the cell layer was similar to that of the secreted material (data not shown). Because the majority of the newly synthesized proteoglycans was secreted into the medium and because the same ionic strength was required to isolate proteoglycans by ion exchange chromatography from both the medium and cell layer, only the medium compartment was characterized further. To characterize the hydrodynamic size and types of proteoglycans synthesized by monocyte-derived macrophages,35SO4-labeled medium was subjected to SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography. On SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, 35SO4-labeled material secreted into the medium migrated as a single broad band, with an apparent molecular mass between 200 and 350 kDa (Fig. 2 A). To assess whether these proteoglycans could be resolved further by hydrodynamic size, 35S-labeled material was chromatographed on Sepharose CL-4B molecular sieve columns under dissociative conditions (21Schönherr E. Kinsella M.G. Wight T.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The 35SO4-labeled material was not resolved further but eluted within the inclusion volume of the column as a single peak at K av = 0.40 (Fig. 2 B). It should be noted that because of the nonglobular chromatographic nature of intact proteoglycans, this is not a method for determination of the molecular mass of proteoglycan species. To determine whether all of the35SO4-labeled material was proteoglycans and to determine the size of the glycosaminoglycan chains associated with the proteoglycan, the chains were released from the core proteins by reductive alkaline β-elimination and analyzed for hydrodynamic size by molecular sieve chromatography. Associative conditions were used to preserve the structure of the glycosaminoglycan chains for further characterization. On Sepharose CL-6B, the intact proteoglycan eluted within the inclusion volume of the column with a peak atK av = 0.18. After reductive alkaline β-elimination, the elution profile shifted to aK av = 0.40, indicating that the liberated glycosaminoglycan chains had an apparent molecular mass of ∼18 kDa (23Wasteson Å. J. Chromatogr. 1971; 59: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). Fractions corresponding to free glycosaminoglycan chains were pooled and reconcentrated by DEAE-ion exchange chromatography for further characterization. Size exclusion chromatography and digestion of glycosaminoglycan chains with specific enzymes aided in determination of the general types of proteoglycans present. Glycosaminoglycan chains purified by Sepharose CL-6B (Fig. 3 A) were treated with chondroitin ABC lyase or heparinase treatment, and the degradation products were analyzed by Sepharose CL-4B size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3 B). When the total free glycosaminoglycan chains were treated with chondroitin ABC lyase, ∼80% of the 35SO4radioactivity eluted at the column Vton Sepharose CL-4B, whereas ∼20% of the radioactivity was not degraded. Treatment of free glycosaminoglycan chains with heparinases I and II resulted in ∼10% of the 35SO4radioactivity eluting at Vt, whereas the remaining ∼90% was not degraded and eluted with the same meanK av = 0.40 as the undigested chains. Thus, macrophages secrete proteoglycans of high apparent molecular mass which contain primarily chondroitin sulfate/dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycans and a minor amount of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans. [35S]Methionine-proteoglycans were treated with chondroitin ABC lyase and heparinase for analysis SDS-PAGE. With chondroitin ABC lyase treatment, macrophage proteoglycans were found to contain two core protein bands of ∼100 and ∼55 kDa (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). No core protein bands were visualized after treatment of the proteoglycans with heparinase I and II (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). To identify the macrophage core protein bands, a series of Western immunoblots was performed using a panel of antibodies against known proteoglycans. Core proteins for the major proteoglycans secreted by smooth muscle cells, versican, biglycan, and decorin, were not detected in macrophage proteoglycan preparations (Fig. 4 B). However, an antibody against PG-100/PG-MCSF recognized both the 100-kDa and 55-kDa core protein bands (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). In some, but not all, experiments, this antibody also recognized another band at ∼65 kDa (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). This band also was seen in some experiments in the enzyme control conditions (data not shown). In contrast, medium from radiolabeled cultures of non-human primate arterial smooth muscle cells did not contain immunodetectable PG-100/PG-MCSF (Fig. 4 C, lane 2). The lipoprotein-binding capacity of the proteoglycans secreted by HMDM was evaluated using an agarose gel mobility shift assay. In this system, free35SO4-proteoglycans migrate toward the front of the gel, whereas 35SO4-proteoglycans complexed to lipoproteins remain near the origin of the gel. In the absence of any lipoprotein, the 35SO4-proteoglycans were resolved into two bands by this system (Fig. 5 A). In the presence of increasing concentrations of lipoprotein, both proteoglycan bands bound to N-LDL (Fig. 5 A) with high affinity. However, the slower migrating upper band (Band 1) exhibited higher affinity binding (K a = 1.5 × 10−7m;n = 3) to N-LDL than did the faster migrating lower band (Band 2) (K a = 7.7 × 10−7m; n = 3). The binding of macrophage proteoglycans to several forms of modified LDL also was examined. 35SO4-Labeled proteoglycan binding to mildly oxidized LDL (Fig. 5 B) and methyl-LDL (Fig. 5 C), two forms of modified LDL with a charge similar to that of N-LDL (data not shown), was similar to the binding to N-LDL (Fig. 5 A). In contrast, neither proteoglycan band bound to acetyl-LDL (Fig. 5 D) or to extensively oxidized LDL (Fig. 5 E), two forms of modified LDL with decreased electronegativity (data not shown). Thus, the overall negative charge of LDL is important in its binding to macrophage proteoglycans. The contribution of the glycosaminoglycan chains and the core protein to the interaction of the macrophage proteoglycans with N-LDL also was determined. Free glycosaminoglycan chains were prepared from35SO4-labeled material by reductive alkaline β-elimination and size exclusion chromatography as shown in Fig. 3 B. In the agarose gel mobility shift assay the free glycosaminoglycan chains migrated as a single band with higher electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5 F) than either of the two intact proteoglycan bands (Fig. 5 A). In the presence of increasing concentrations of lipoprotein, the free glycosaminoglycan chains also bound to N-LDL (Fig. 5 F). In addition, [35S]methionine-core protein was prepared by chondroitin ABC lyase digestion of [35S]methionine-labeled material. This resulted in some aggregation, as seen at the origin of the gel (Fig. 5 G). However, free core protein migrated as a single band of slower electrophoretic mobility than either of the two intact proteoglycan bands. The intensity of this band did not diminish with increasing concentrations of N-LDL, indicating that the free core protein did not bind N-LDL (Fig. 5 G). Thus, the glycosaminoglycan chains, but not the core protein, of the macrophage proteoglycans contribute to the interaction with N-LDL. The two macrophage proteoglycan bands that were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose were isolated and characterized further.35SO4-Proteoglycans were applied to an agarose gel in the absence of lipoproteins and electrophoresed for 7 h to achieve further resolution of the bands. The two bands then were cut out of the gel and reconcentrated on DEAE-Sephacel for characterization. Both bands consisted of intact proteoglycan, as determined by SDS-PAGE and molecular sieve chromatography. On SDS-PAGE, Band 1 migrated as a broad band with an apparent molecular mass between 150 and 350 kDa, and Band 2 migrated as a broad band with an apparent mass between 150 and 300 kDa (Fig. 6 A). On Sepharose CL-6B, Band 1 eluted with a peak atK av = 0.16 (Fig. 6 B), and Band 2 eluted with a peak at K av = 0.18 (Fig. 6 C). After reductive alkaline β-elimination, the elution profile of both bands shifted, and the liberated gly"

A trans-splicing system, using separately purified and expressed N- and C-terminal intein fragments of about 100 amino acids each, fused to appropriate exteins, was recently derived from the Mycobacterium tuberculosis RecA intein (Mills, K. V., Lew, B. M., Jiang, S.-Q., and Paulus, H. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 95, 3543–3548). We have replaced the C-terminal intein fragment of this system with synthetic peptides comprising 35–50 of the C-terminal residues of the RecA intein. The N-terminal intein fragment and the synthetic peptide were reconstituted by renaturation from guanidinium chloride. In the absence of added reductants, a disulfide-linked dimer of the N-terminal fragment and the peptide accumulated and could be induced to splice by reduction of its disulfide bond. The intermediate and spliced products were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, and derivatization with thiol-reactive biotin followed by Western blotting with a streptavidin-enzyme conjugate.

Protein splicing is a mechanism for the post-translational processing of proteins that involves the self-catalyzed excision of an intervening polypeptide, the intein, and the subsequent formation of a new protein by joining the flanking sequences, the exteins, by a peptide bond. It involves the catalysis of three mechanistically unrelated reactions at a single catalytic center, which resides entirely within the intein (for reviews, see Refs. 1Shao Y. Kent S.B.H. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 187-194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar and 2Perler F. Xu M.Q. Paulus H. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1997; 1: 292-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The intein can thus be viewed as an exceedingly complex enzyme, and the investigation of the catalytic mechanisms involved in protein splicing is of great interest. With the aim of obtaining an in vitro protein splicing system whose structure and function can be examined by biochemical and biophysical methods, we are developing a minimal protein splicing element from the 440-residue RecA intein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis by eliminating the portions of the intein that are not essential for protein splicing. Most inteins are interrupted by homing endonuclease domains, which account for about one-half of the intein sequence but can be deleted without eliminating protein splicing ability (3Derbyshire V.

Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that the RecA intein can be split into two fragments that can complement each other so as to promotetrans-splicing (5Shingledecker K. Jiang S.Q. Paulus H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This made possible the development of anin vitro trans-splicing system composed of 105-residue N- and C-terminal fragments of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein (6Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). An in vitro trans-splicing system based on the Pol-1 intein of the hyper- thermophilic archeon, Pyrococcussp. GB-D, was recently described (7Southworth M.W. Adam E. Panne D. Byer R. Kautz R. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The results described in this paper further advance our approach by replacing the natural C-terminal intein fragment with 35–50-residue synthetic polypeptides. The resulting semisynthetic protein splicing element was able to catalyze protein splicing with high efficiency. This exciting development will facilitate the study of the structure and catalytic function of the C-terminal portion of the intein by replacing specific residues with other natural amino acids or with unnatural amino acids and structural probes.

(an in-frame fusion of MBP to the 105 N-terminal amino acids of theM. tuberculosis RecA intein, followed by the C-terminal sequence Arg-Gly-Glu-Phe) was described earlier (5Shingledecker K. Jiang S.Q. Paulus H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). MUNΔwas expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and purified as described previously (6Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Peptides with a C-terminal amide group ranging from 33 to 52 residues in length (see Fig. 1) were synthesized by N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 431 peptide synthesizer, using 4-methyl benzhydrylamine resin (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA),O-trityl-protected Thr, double coupling of all Thr and Arg residues, an acetic anhydride blocking step at each cycle, andN-methylpyrrolidone supplemented with dimethyl sulfoxide to 10%. The peptides were cleaved from the resin and deprotected with 6.25% (w/v) phenol in thioanisole:1,2-ethanedithiol:water:trifluoroacetic acid (2:1:2:20). The peptides were purified by HPLC (Rainin), using a preparative C8 column (Vydac) and monitoring the fractions by MALDI-TOF MS. Protein samples were dialyzed overnight against water and mixed on a mass spectrometry plate with an equal volume of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (1 mg/ml) in water:isopropyl alcohol:formic acid (3:2:1). An external standard of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin was also prepared, and the MUNΔ starting material was used as an internal mass standard. MS was performed on a Voyager RP Biospectrometry Workstation (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) using linear mode and a low mass gate of 2000. PerSeptive GRAMS/386 data analysis software was used, and a Savitsky-Golay 19-order smoothing function was performed on all spectra. The standard reconstitution procedure involved mixing MUNΔ and peptide at concentrations of 9 and 84 μm, respectively, unless otherwise indicated, followed by dialysis against Buffer N (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5; 6 m GdmCl; 500 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA) for 1 h at 4 °C, using SpectraPor 3500 MWCO dialysis tubing, followed by dialysis for 1 h against three changes of Buffer O (Buffer N without GdmCl). A sample of the dialyzed mixture was saved at 4 °C to study formation of the MUNΔ/peptide heterodimer, and the remainder was allowed to undergo splicing by adding TCEP to 1 mm and incubating at 25 °C for 16 h. Protein and peptide concentrations were estimated from their absorbance at 280 nm and the calculated molar absorption coefficients as described earlier (6Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In some cases, samples were reduced with 1 mm TCEP and then biotinylated by treatment with 0.04 volume of 8.5 mm BMCC (Pierce) in dimethyl sulfoxide at 25 °C for 2 h. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using precast 10–20% gradient Tris/glycine gels (Owl Scientific, Cambridge, MA) and prestained protein markers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), according to the method of Laemmli (8Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar), except that DTT was omitted from the sample buffer where indicated. Gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue. To screen for biotinylated proteins, gels were blotted for 16 h onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher and Schuell) at 36 V. The blots were soaked for 30 min in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl), washed twice for 5 min in TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl), and then incubated with 2 mg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) diluted 1:2000 in TBS for 1 h. The blots were washed twice for 5 min in TBS, and immobilized alkaline phosphatase activity was detected using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium substrate tablets (Sigma). Gels and Western blots were scanned with a Supervista S-12 scanner (Umax Data Systems) and analyzed densitometrically using the NIH Image 1.60 program. In the in vitro trans-splicing system developed earlier, 105-residue N- and C-terminal fragments of theM. tuberculosis RecA intein, fused to appropriate exteins, were mixed in 6 m urea or GdmCl and reconstituted by removing the denaturant by dialysis (6Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The two intein fragments formed a heterodimer, which underwent efficient protein splicing under reducing conditions. Upon replacing the C-terminal intein fragment with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 50 C-terminal intein residues, linked to Cys-Ala as the C-extein (Fig. 1), an analogous set of reactions was observed. As shown in Fig. 2 (lane 5), about 55% of MUNΔ was converted to a 61-kDa protein, whose molecular mass was consistent with that of a disulfide-linked MUNΔ/peptide heterodimer. Upon addition of the reductant, TCEP, the 61-kDa protein was replaced by a new 43-kDa protein, in an amount corresponding to 50% of MUNΔ and consistent in molecular mass with the putative spliced product,i.e. M linked to Cys-Ala (Fig. 2, lane 4). The overall splicing reaction proceeded somewhat more efficiently (60% yield based on MUNΔ) when TCEP was added at the beginning of the reconstitution procedure (Fig. 2, lane 3). Neither the 61-kDa intermediate nor the 43-kDa putative spliced product was observed when the peptide or MUNΔ was omitted from the reaction (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The putative heterodimeric intermediate and splicing product were further characterized by MS. Samples of the starting materials, the products of renaturation in the absence of TCEP, and the splicing reaction after addition of TCEP were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The major molecular species that was observed in the starting mixture corresponded to MUNΔ (m/z = 55,064) and the 52-residue peptide (m/z = 6,051) (Fig. 3 B). Upon renaturation under non-reducing conditions, an additional component was found withm/z of 61,100, in close agreement with that expected for the disulfide-linked heterodimer of MUNΔ and the 52-mer (m/z = 61,113) (Fig. 3 C). Upon addition of TCEP, them/z = 61,100 ionic species disappeared, and three new major ionic species appeared withm/z = 43,200, 12,000, and 5,900, consistent with the predicted m/z values of 43,293, 11,964, and 5,875 for the splicing product (M-Cys-Ala), the intein fragment (UNΔ), and the 50-residue peptide fragment, respectively (Fig. 3 D). The expected product of protein splicing, M-Cys-Ala, differs by a mass of only 193 mass units, corresponding to the dipeptide Cys-Ala, from M itself, which could have been produced from cleavage at the upstream splice junction (5Shingledecker K. Jiang S.Q. Paulus H. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 207: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We therefore used an independent chemical assay for the identification of the putative protein splicing product. Because protein splicing leads to transfer of Cys-Ala to the C terminus of M, which itself contains no Cys residues, it should be possible to distinguish between M and the splicing product, M-Cys-Ala, by a method that specifically detects thiols. The products of the splicing reaction were treated with the thiol-reactive biotin-maleimide derivative, BMCC, which should specifically label all proteins containing Cys residues, including MUNΔ and the splicing product, M-Cys-Ala, but not free M. After SDS-PAGE and blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes, biotinylated proteins were detected using a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate. In the complete splicing mixtures, a 43-kDa protein was the major biotin-labeled species (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3), whereas only MUNΔ was labeled in a mixture without the 52-residue peptide (Fig. 4, lane 5) and neither labeled component was observed when MUNΔ was omitted (Fig. 4,lane 7). No signal was observed with samples that had not been subjected to biotinylation (Fig. 4, lanes 2,4, 6, and 8). As another control, molecular mass markers including MBP were labeled with BMCC and developed on a Western blot. All marker proteins with free thiols were labeled, whereas MBP was not (data not shown). The observation that the 43-kDa protein produced in the complete system could be biotinylated with BMCC identified it as the spliced protein, M-Cys-Ala, rather than a cleavage product such as M. Investigation of the role of prior denaturation on the reconstitution and splicing reactions showed that significant amounts of MUNΔ/peptide heterodimer were formed when MUNΔ and the peptide were mixed in the absence of GdmCl, together with some higher aggregates (Fig. 5, lane 3), but that subsequent reduction yielded little spliced product (Fig. 5, lane 4) compared with reaction mixtures in which MUNΔ and the peptide were reconstituted under denaturing conditions (Fig. 5,lanes 1 and 2). It is interesting that the heterodimer formed under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 5, lane 3) failed to undergo efficient splicing, suggesting that productive interaction of the intein fragments to form a functional protein splicing active center requires prior unfolding of the polypeptide chains. The experiments described in Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 were carried out with a nearly 10-fold molar excess of the 52-residue peptide. When the ratio of peptide to MUNΔ was varied at a constant concentration (42 μm) of MUNΔ, maximum conversion to spliced product (55%) was observed with an equimolar amount of peptide, suggesting a stoichiometric interaction of the two intein components (Fig. 6). The extent of conversion of MUNΔ to spliced product roughly paralleled the extent of conversion to disulfide-linked heterodimer when this was measured separately (see Figs. 2, lanes 4 and 5and Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). The extent of conversion of MUNΔ to spliced product varied from 55 to 90% (for example, compare Figs. 2 and 4). Peptides comprising fewer than the 50 C-terminal amino acids of the protein splicing element were also examined for their ability to function in protein splicing. Each peptide was present in a 3-fold molar excess with respect to MUNΔ. The results summarized in Fig. 7 show that a peptide corresponding to the 35 C-terminal amino acids of the intein was fully able to substitute for the 52-mer, whereas a peptide corresponding to the 31 C-terminal amino acids was inactive. The results described in this paper demonstrate that a semisynthetic protein splicing element can effectively catalyze the complex series of reactions that lead to protein splicing. Our experimental system consisted of two fragments of an intein linked to appropriate exteins, which could be non-covalently reconstituted to form a functional protein splicing element; one intein fragment was a natural 105-residue protein segment and the other a synthetic 50-residue polypeptide. There have been other examples of active semisynthetic enzymes that can be reconstituted by the association of a natural and a synthetic fragment, the first being the reconstitution of ribonuclease S from S-peptide (residues 1–20) and S-protein (residues 21–124), which are produced by the cleavage of ribonuclease A with subtilisin (9Richards F.M. Vithayathil P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 1459-1464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replacement of the S-peptide with synthetic analogs yields functional semisynthetic ribonuclease derivatives (e.g. Ref. 10Chaiken I.M. Freedman M.H. Lyerla J.R. Cohen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 884-891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein splicing elements should lend themselves especially well to reconstitution as semisynthetic enzymes because the protein splicing active center is composed of polypeptide sequences that correspond to the extreme ends of the intein. Interspersed between these protein splicing sequences is often an extensive, functionally unrelated homing endonuclease domain (11Duan X. Gimble F.S. Quiocho F.A. Cell. 1997; 89: 555-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), which imposes a spatial and temporal gap between their synthesis and assembly into a single functional domain. Indeed, natural N- and C-terminal fragments of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein, separately expressed and purified, were found to reconstitute and undergo protein splicing with high efficiency (6Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S.-Q. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3453-3458Crossref Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Our observation that synthetic polypeptides corresponding to between 35 and 50 of the C-terminal amino acids of the intein could effectively promote protein splicing offers an excellent opportunity for probing the structure and function of the protein splicing active center by substituting other amino acids or unnatural amino acid analogs at specific positions in the peptide. An especially attractive feature of our experimental system is that we can measure the reconstitution reaction separately from protein splicing by using mildly oxidizing conditions under which a refolded disulfide-linked heterodimer accumulates, which can subsequently be made to undergo quantitative conversion to the spliced products by reduction with TCEP. One can, therefore, study the effect of amino acid substitutions on the reconstitution reaction per se, i.e. the formation of a disulfide-linked complex, or on the protein splicing reaction per se, which occurs upon reduction of the disulfide-linked heterodimer. In addition, because the disulfide-linked heterodimer can be isolated as a stable protein, the structure of the protein splicing active center and its perturbation by amino acid substitution can be studied by various biophysical methods. The unusual nature of the protein splicing element as an enzyme should make such future investigations especially exciting. One question that can be addressed immediately concerns the minimum size of the downstream intein fragment that is required for protein splicing. In a deletion analysis, Derbyshire et al. (3Derbyshire V. Wood D.W. Wu W. Dansereau J.T. Dalgaard L.Z. Belfort M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11466-11471Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) found that protein splicing occurs in vivo when all but the last 35 C-terminal amino acids of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein are deleted but not after deletion of all but the last 31 residues. The 50-residue sequence used in most of our experiments is larger than the minimum size of the C-terminal intein fragment required for protein splicing. However, we could reconstitute a functional semisynthetic protein splicing element with a synthetic peptide corresponding to the 35 C-terminal residues of the M. tuberculosis RecA intein but not with one corresponding to the 31 C-terminal residues (Fig. 7). By synthesizing polypeptides of intermediate size, we should be able to define precisely the minimal length required for protein splicing. We thank Kaori Shingledecker for help and advice, Shu-qin Jiang for preparing the plasmid, Anna Wong for synthesizing the peptides, and Paul Leavis and Betty Gowell for use of their preparative HPLC."

The efficiency of utilizing G proteins as transducers is evident from their evolutionary conservation as well as the vast array of sensory pathways that they regulate. Thus, sensory inputs as diverse as light, taste, pressure, olfaction, and hormone-binding, all employ GTP-binding proteins as critical mediators of signal transduction pathways (1Bourne H.R.

Similar types of regulatory roles have been assigned in the past decade to a subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins, which includes the Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 proteins.

At any given time, the level of activated G protein is determined by the rates of two primary reactions, the guanine nucleotide (GTP-GDP) exchange reaction, which results in GTP binding and G protein activation, and the GTP hydrolytic reaction, which results in the deactivation of the G protein.The G protein activation event is achieved by acceleration of GDP dissociation from the nucleotide-binding pocket, a reaction that is catalyzed by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Mant,N-methylanthraniloyl. 1The abbreviations used are: GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; Mant,N-methylanthraniloyl. In the case of heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, the membrane-bound serpentine receptors play the roles of GEFs (e.g. rhodopsin or the β-adrenergic receptor), while in the superfamily of small GTPases, the GEFs are typically soluble proteins. GEFs for the Rho-like GTPases share similar domain structure, namely a tandem arrangement of Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains, and often exhibit high oncogenic capacity (13Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which a stimulus causes complex formation between GEFs and GTPases is still largely unknown, except for the case of Ras, where growth factor receptor signaling results in recruitment of the GEF to the plasma membrane, thus ensuring its proximity to the Ras protein (14Li A.

Virtually all GTP-binding proteins have an inherent capability to hydrolyze GTP. However, in the case of Ras-related small G proteins, the rate of this reaction is significantly accelerated by GTPase-activating proteins, or GAPs. GAPs for the Rho subfamily of GTP-binding proteins belong to a family whose members share significant sequence homology in a conserved GAP domain, and, to some extent, overlapping function. Examples for Rho GAPs are the Cdc42-GAP (also termed Rho-GAP) (18Barfod E.T. Zheng Y. Kuang W.J. Hart M.J. Evans T. Cerione R.A. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol.

However, during the past year, structural determinations of Cdc42-GAP in complex with Cdc42Hs·GppNHp and with Rho·GDP·AlF4−clearly showed a conserved arginine residue protruding into the GTPase active site, where it makes contact with the nucleotide β-γ oxygens and the catalytic glutamine residue of the GTP-binding protein (Gln61 in Cdc42 and Gln63 in RhoA) (23Rittinger K.

The hamster liver microsomal 7α-HCD was purified to homogeneity using 2′,5′-ADP and cholic acid-agarose affinity chromatography. 7α-HCD displayed a molecular weight of approximately 34,000 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; it is an intrinsic membrane protein of the hamster liver endoplasmic reticulum and exists as a multimeric aggregate in pure form. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that 7α-HCD had high sequence similarity to human 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD; 24/30 amino acid identity). TheK m values for corticosterone and 7α-hydroxycholesterol were 1.2 and 1.9 μm, respectively, for purified 7α-HCD; both reactions displayed identicalV max values (approximately 170 nmol/min/mg of protein). The IC50 of carbenoxolone, a competitive inhibitor of 11β-HSD, was 75 nm for 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenation and 210 nm for corticosterone dehydrogenation. The tissue-specific expression in hamster was as follows: adrenal ≥ liver > kidney > testis ≫ brain > lung.Microsomal 7α-HCD is uniquely expressed in hamster liver and to some extent in human liver but not in rat liver. Western blot analysis with two antibodies elicited against an N-terminal peptide of the human 11β-HSD and purified hamster liver 7α-HCD, respectively, suggested the presence of multiple forms of 7α-HCD in hamster liver, most likely due to the existence of a family of 11β-HSD proteins. Since 7-oxocholesterol is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, alternative mechanisms for regulation of bile acid synthesis may exist in human and hamster liver due to production of this metabolite and its potential as an oxysterol.

Since 7-oxocholesterol is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, alternative mechanisms for regulation of bile acid synthesis may exist in human and hamster liver due to production of this metabolite and its potential as an oxysterol. The first regulated step in bile acid synthesis is hydroxylation of cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the apparent rate limiting reaction in this pathway (1Carey M.C. Cahalane M.J. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1988: 573-616Google Scholar). Oxidation of the 3β-ol group to an oxo group and rearrangement of the unsaturated bond at Δ5-position to Δ4 followed by hydroxylation at either the C-12 or C-27 position converts the sterol to its active form essential for digestion of fatty nutrients. Recently, an alternate pathway to bile acids has been elucidated involving first 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol and subsequent oxidation at position C-3 and hydroxylation at position C-7 eventually leading to chenodeoxycholic acid (2Axelson M. Sjovall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).A unique hamster liver microsomal 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase (7α-HCD) 1The abbreviations used are: 7α-HCD, 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase; C12E9, dodecyl nonaoxyethylene glycol monoether; DE52, DEAE-cellulose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; IC50, concentration causing 50% inhibition; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol 8000; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: 7α-HCD, 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase; C12E9, dodecyl nonaoxyethylene glycol monoether; DE52, DEAE-cellulose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; IC50, concentration causing 50% inhibition; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol 8000; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. was discovered in our laboratory during the development of an HPLC method for assay of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (3Song W.

Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The oxidized metabolite produced by 7α-HCD, 7-oxocholesterol, is a bioactive sterol and potent competitive inhibitor of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (approximately K i for 7-oxocholesterol of 7 μm versus approximately K mfor exogenous cholesterol of 100 μm; Ref. 5Cantfort J.V. Life Sci. 1972; 11: 773-780Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although oxycholesterol derivatives are formed during chemical autoxidation of cholesterol, the presence of 7-oxo-bile acids observed in the blood of infants suggests that a unique metabolic pathway leading to 7-oxo-bile acids may exist in humans and other mammals (6Strandvik B. Wahlen E. Wikstrom S.A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1994; 54: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Individuals with the rare inherited disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who lack cholesterol 27-hydroxylase activity display significant levels of 7-oxocholesterol in their blood (7Bjorkhem I. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic salt loading of hypertensive baboons (8Gontscharow V.N.P. Simarina A.J. Jefremova S.K. Schon R. Schubert K. Endokrinologie. 1975; 64: 213-216PubMed Google Scholar) or rhesus monkeys with hemorrhagic fever (9Gontscharow N.P. Wehrberger K. Schubert K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1971; 2: 389-391Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) also result in significant blood levels of 7-oxocholesterol, in addition to 7α- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Interestingly, intravenous infusion of 7-oxocholesterol into rats decreased bile acid secretion and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity, protein content, and mRNA levels (10Breuer O. Sudjana-Sugiaman E. Eggertsen G. Chiang J.Y. Bjorkhem I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to compensate for the lack of bile acid production. Therefore, hepatic 7α-HCD and its products may participate in the regulation of bile acid synthesis.A number of genes encoding proteins that oxidize hydroxyl groups of sterols have been identified to date (11Labrie F. Simard J. Luu-The V. Pelletier G. Belghmi K. Belanger A. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 8: 451-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Monder C. Lakshmi V. Steroids. 1988; 52: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For example, unique 3β-, 11β-, and 17β-hydroxysterol dehydrogenases have been described; each possesses a unique stereochemical reaction, pyridine nucleotide specificity, and tissue-specific localization. These short chain alcohol dehydrogenases found in the liver are thought to be involved in either the processing or termination of function of various bioactive sterols, such as bile acids, dehydroepiandrosterone, 5-ene-androsten-3β,17β-diol, androstenedione, cortisol, corticosterone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, pregnenolone, and progesterone. However, no enzyme with 7α-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase activity has been described to date.Since 7-oxocholesterol apparently could be formed by an enzyme-mediated process, we purified this enzyme to homogeneity from hamster liver to further characterize it. Using the purified enzyme, we analyzed the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, studied its substrate specificity, and elicited a polycolonal antibody to assess the tissue- and species-specific expression of 7α-HCD. Our results suggest that this enzyme, which exhibits high substrate specificity for corticosterone, cortisol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol in the hamster liver (and possibly humans), may be a member of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family. However, either it is not expressed in rat liver, or the rat 11β-HSD does not catalyze oxidation of 7α- or 7β-hydroxylated sterols.DISCUSSIONPurified 7α-HCD had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa and preferred NADP+ as cofactor, like the liver-specific type I 11β-HSD. NAD+ was about 50% as effective as a cofactor at a much higher concentration than needed for NADP+ (4Song W. Pierce Jr., W.M. Saeki Y. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that 7α-HCD has high sequence similarity to human and rat type I 11β-HSD in the N-terminal region, indicating that it may be related to type I 11β-HSD. The 7α-HCD dehydrogenase reaction appeared to be irreversible for the purified hamster enzyme, which was also observed by others for purified rat liver type I 11β-HSD (17Monder C. White P.C. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 187-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast to purified rat liver type I 11β-HSD, membrane-bound (18Koerner D.R. Biochim. Biophys.

The reason that purified 11β-HSD and 7α-HCD did not display reductase activity is unknown. Substrate specificity studies demonstrate that 7α-HCD has substrates in common with 11β-HSD but not with 3β-HSD or 17β-HSD. 7α-HCD has high affinity for 7α-hydroxycholesterol and corticosterone, indicating that both steroids may serve as endogenous substrate in vivo. Other bile acids and cholesterol derivatives could be oxidized at the 3β-ol position, albeit at much lower rates of oxidation than 7α-hydroxycholesterol.Experiments designed to determine the species-specific expression of 7α-HCD using a polyclonal antibody demonstrated that 7α-HCD was expressed in hamster and to some extent in human microsomes but not in rat liver microsomes. The tissue-specific expression of 7α-HCD was as follows: adrenal ≥ liver > kidney > testis ≫ brain > lung, which is similar to the pattern of expression of type I 11β-HSD. These data indicate that 7α-HCD may also participate in adrenal steroid hormone metabolism. The most surprising finding of this study is that the 7-oxocholesterol formation is catalyzed by a steroid dehydrogenase similar to 11β-HSD type I. Two 11β-HSD forms have been identified. Type I 11β-HSD preferentially uses NADP+ and is present mainly in liver. It may be responsible for inactivating glucocorticoid hormones, i.e.cortisol or corticosterone, in that tissue.The type II 11β-HSD enzyme utilizes NAD+ instead of NADP+ as a cofactor and is present in rabbit kidney cortical collecting duct cells (20Rusvai E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 25959-25962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) isolated a sheep kidney cDNA clone encoding Type II 11β-HSD by expression screening using Xenopus oocytes. The cDNA (1.8 kilobases) encodes a protein of 427 amino acid residues (M r = 46,700). Based on predicted amino acid sequence, it was only 20% sequence similar to the type I 11β-HSD; regions that had identity included the putative pyridine nucleotide- and steroid-binding regions observed in many short chain alcohol dehydrogenases. The expressed enzyme functions as an NAD+-dependent 11β-dehydrogenase with apparent K m values of 15 nm for cortisol and 0.7 nm for corticosterone and displayed no detectable reductase activity. The cDNA hybridized to a 1.9-kilobase mRNA species in kidney and adrenal and was detectable in colon. There was no detectable hybridization of the cDNA probe to mRNA from liver, lung, testis, ovary, heart, stomach, small intestine, or skin. The corresponding gene in humans is a candidate for the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess. In humans, the cortisol metabolite cortisone is excreted into the urine (25Peterson R.E. Wyngaarden J.B. Guerra S.L. Brodie B.B. Bunim J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1779-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but in rats about 90% of corticosterone metabolite 11-dehydrocorticosterone is recovered in bile (26Gustafsson J.A. Gustafsson S.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 44: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), reflecting primarily hepatic metabolism.Glycyrrhetinic acid, a component of licorice, is a cyclic triterpene whose fused ring structure resembles that of glucocorticoids. This agent has been linked to a syndrome similar to mineralocorticoid excess in a Dutch population (16Stewart P.M. Wallace A.M. Valentino R. Burt D. Shackleton C.H. Edwards C.R.W. Lancet. 1987; 2: 821-824Abstract PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). The observation that glycyrrhetinic acid can decrease blood cholesterol levels (27Evdokimova N.I. Kamilov I.K. Kamilov I.K. Farmakologiia Alkaloidov i Glikozidov. Fan, Tashkent, Uzbekiston1967: 222-226Google Scholar) and increase bile secretion (28Ichioka H. Gifu Daigaku Igakubu Kiyo. 1968; 15 (abstr.): 810-812Google Scholar) indicates that isozyme(s) of 11β-HSD may participate in or regulate bile acid synthesis. Our study demonstrates that 7α-HCD is a putative type I 11β-HSD in hamster and is inhibited by the glycyrrhetinic acid derivative, carbenoxolone. Since the product of 7α-HCD, 7-oxocholesterol, is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, inhibition of 7α-HCD might diminish the formation of 7-oxocholesterol and thus activate cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase. This effect would enhance flux of the sterols through the bile acid synthesis pathway and possibly lower blood cholesterol. 7α-HCD may also catalyze formation of a yet unknown hormone as a side product of the bile acid biosynthetic pathway in hamsters and possibly in humans. The first regulated step in bile acid synthesis is hydroxylation of cholesterol to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase, the apparent rate limiting reaction in this pathway (1Carey M.C. Cahalane M.J. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1988: 573-616Google Scholar). Oxidation of the 3β-ol group to an oxo group and rearrangement of the unsaturated bond at Δ5-position to Δ4 followed by hydroxylation at either the C-12 or C-27 position converts the sterol to its active form essential for digestion of fatty nutrients. Recently, an alternate pathway to bile acids has been elucidated involving first 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol and subsequent oxidation at position C-3 and hydroxylation at position C-7 eventually leading to chenodeoxycholic acid (2Axelson M. Sjovall J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1990; 36: 631-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A unique hamster liver microsomal 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase (7α-HCD) 1The abbreviations used are: 7α-HCD, 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase; C12E9, dodecyl nonaoxyethylene glycol monoether; DE52, DEAE-cellulose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; IC50, concentration causing 50% inhibition; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol 8000; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: 7α-HCD, 7α-hydroxycholesterol dehydrogenase; C12E9, dodecyl nonaoxyethylene glycol monoether; DE52, DEAE-cellulose; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HSD, hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; IC50, concentration causing 50% inhibition; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PEG, polyethylene glycol 8000; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid. was discovered in our laboratory during the development of an HPLC method for assay of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (3Song W. Pierce Jr., W.M. Prough R.A. Redinger R.N. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1439-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 4Song W. Pierce Jr., W.M. Saeki Y. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The oxidized metabolite produced by 7α-HCD, 7-oxocholesterol, is a bioactive sterol and potent competitive inhibitor of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity (approximately K i for 7-oxocholesterol of 7 μm versus approximately K mfor exogenous cholesterol of 100 μm; Ref. 5Cantfort J.V. Life Sci. 1972; 11: 773-780Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Although oxycholesterol derivatives are formed during chemical autoxidation of cholesterol, the presence of 7-oxo-bile acids observed in the blood of infants suggests that a unique metabolic pathway leading to 7-oxo-bile acids may exist in humans and other mammals (6Strandvik B. Wahlen E. Wikstrom S.A. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1994; 54: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Individuals with the rare inherited disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis who lack cholesterol 27-hydroxylase activity display significant levels of 7-oxocholesterol in their blood (7Bjorkhem I. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition, chronic salt loading of hypertensive baboons (8Gontscharow V.N.P. Simarina A.J. Jefremova S.K. Schon R. Schubert K. Endokrinologie. 1975; 64: 213-216PubMed Google Scholar) or rhesus monkeys with hemorrhagic fever (9Gontscharow N.P. Wehrberger K. Schubert K. J. Steroid Biochem. 1971; 2: 389-391Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar) also result in significant blood levels of 7-oxocholesterol, in addition to 7α- and 7β-hydroxycholesterol. Interestingly, intravenous infusion of 7-oxocholesterol into rats decreased bile acid secretion and increased cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase enzyme activity, protein content, and mRNA levels (10Breuer O. Sudjana-Sugiaman E. Eggertsen G. Chiang J.Y. Bjorkhem I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) to compensate for the lack of bile acid production. Therefore, hepatic 7α-HCD and its products may participate in the regulation of bile acid synthesis. A number of genes encoding proteins that oxidize hydroxyl groups of sterols have been identified to date (11Labrie F. Simard J. Luu-The V. Pelletier G. Belghmi K. Belanger A. Baillieres Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 8: 451-474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 12Monder C. Lakshmi V. Steroids. 1988; 52: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For example, unique 3β-, 11β-, and 17β-hydroxysterol dehydrogenases have been described; each possesses a unique stereochemical reaction, pyridine nucleotide specificity, and tissue-specific localization. These short chain alcohol dehydrogenases found in the liver are thought to be involved in either the processing or termination of function of various bioactive sterols, such as bile acids, dehydroepiandrosterone, 5-ene-androsten-3β,17β-diol, androstenedione, cortisol, corticosterone, 17α-hydroxypregnenolone, pregnenolone, and progesterone. However, no enzyme with 7α-hydroxysterol dehydrogenase activity has been described to date. Since 7-oxocholesterol apparently could be formed by an enzyme-mediated process, we purified this enzyme to homogeneity from hamster liver to further characterize it. Using the purified enzyme, we analyzed the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, studied its substrate specificity, and elicited a polycolonal antibody to assess the tissue- and species-specific expression of 7α-HCD. Our results suggest that this enzyme, which exhibits high substrate specificity for corticosterone, cortisol, and 7α-hydroxycholesterol in the hamster liver (and possibly humans), may be a member of the 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase family. However, either it is not expressed in rat liver, or the rat 11β-HSD does not catalyze oxidation of 7α- or 7β-hydroxylated sterols. DISCUSSIONPurified 7α-HCD had an apparent molecular mass of 34 kDa and preferred NADP+ as cofactor, like the liver-specific type I 11β-HSD. NAD+ was about 50% as effective as a cofactor at a much higher concentration than needed for NADP+ (4Song W. Pierce Jr., W.M. Saeki Y. Redinger R.N. Prough R.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis demonstrated that 7α-HCD has high sequence similarity to human and rat type I 11β-HSD in the N-terminal region, indicating that it may be related to type I 11β-HSD. The 7α-HCD dehydrogenase reaction appeared to be irreversible for the purified hamster enzyme, which was also observed by others for purified rat liver type I 11β-HSD (17Monder C. White P.C. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 187-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In contrast to purified rat liver type I 11β-HSD, membrane-bound (18Koerner D.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Radiolytically generated MDA radical oxidized rapidly the reduced form of cytochrome b 561 to yield the oxidized form. Subsequently the oxidized form of cytochromeb 561 was re-reduced by ascorbate in the medium. The second-order rate constants of the reaction of MDA radical were increased with decreasing pH, whereas a maximum of the second-order rate constant for the reaction with ascorbate was obtained around pH 6.8. At excess MDA radical to cytochrome b 561concentration, only half of the heme in cytochromeb 561 was oxidized, indicating that only one of the two heme centers can react with MDA radical. On the other hand, when the reactions were examined using cytochromeb 561 pretreated in a mild alkaline condition in the oxidized state, the cytochrome b 561 could not be oxidized with MDA radical, suggesting that the heme center specific for the electron donation to MDA radical is selectively modified upon the alkaline treatment. These results suggest that the two heme b centers have distinct roles for the electron donation to MDA radical and the electron acceptance from ascorbate, respectively.

Kelley P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon these monooxygenase reactions, monodehydroascorbate (MDA) radical is produced by univalent oxidation of AsA− (2Diliberto Jr., E.J. Heckman G.D. Daniels A.J. J. Biol.

It is believed that the intravesicular MDA radical is reduced back to AsA− by membrane-bound cytochromeb 561, and subsequently cytochromeb 561 is reduced by extravesicular AsA− (4Njus D. Knoth J.

Thus, cytochrome b 561is likely to serve as an electron shuttle, maintaining the AsA− concentration inside the vesicles.Cytochrome b 561 is a highly hydrophobic hemoprotein with a molecular mass of ∼28 kDa and contains five or six transmembrane α-helices (8Perin M.S.

It had been widely accepted that cytochrome b 561 contains only oneb-type heme per molecule, by analyses with pyridine hemochrome and Western blotting methods for quantitation of heme and apoprotein, respectively (10Wakefield L.M.

Methods. 1984; 9: 331-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, very recently, we have established a new purification procedure of cytochromeb 561 from bovine adrenal chromaffin vesicles (14Tsubaki M. Nakayama M. Okuyama E. Ichikawa Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23206-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We found that the purified cytochrome b 561contained two b-type hemes per molecule. In addition, each heme b center exhibited independent EPR signals in the oxidized state. Based on these results and comparison of the amino acid sequences of cytochrome b 561 from various species, we have proposed that the two heme prosthetic groups are located on both sides of the membrane in close contact with AsA− and MDA binding sites, respectively, to facilitate the electron transfer across the membranes (14Tsubaki M.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the role of each of the two heme b centers has not been elucidated.Because of the instability of the MDA radical, which disproportionates rapidly to dehydroascorbate and AsA−, the electron transfer reaction with cytochrome b 561 was measured indirectly in the presence of AsA− and ascorbate oxidase (5Njus D.

However, it is possible to investigate directly the reaction of MDA radical using a pulse radiolysis technique (16Bielski B.H.J. Allen A.O. J. Am. Chem.

We could observe electron donations to MDA radical from hepatic NADH-cytochrome b 5 reductase (19Kobayashi K. Harada Y. Hayashi K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8310-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and from MDA reductase purified from cucumber chloroplasts (20Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Sano S. Asada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27551-27554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In particular, MDA reductase was shown to be a good electron donor for MDA radical (20Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Sano S. Asada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27551-27554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The present study describes a successful application of the pulse radiolysis technique to investigate the reaction of MDA radical with cytochrome b 561 purified from bovine adrenal chromaffin vesicles. We obtained clear evidence that the two hemeb centers in cytochrome b 561 have distinct roles in the reaction with MDA radical and AsA−, respectively.RESULTSA transient spectrum of MDA radical with an absorbance maximum at 360 nm was observed 100 ns after pulse radiolysis of N2O-saturated aqueous solutions in the presence of 5 mm AsA− and 1.0% β-octyl glucoside. Under the conditions employed here, the primary species (hydrated electron (eaq−), OH⋅, H⋅) generated by pulse radiolysis of aqueous solutions were efficiently converted to MDA radical at an approximate concentration of 20–30 μm (17Bielski B.H.J. Comostock D.A. Bowen R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1971; 93: 5624-5629Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 18Cabelli D.E. Bielski B.H.J. J. Phys.

The MDA radicals thus formed reacted rapidly with the reduced form of cytochrome b 561. A decrease at 430 nm and an increase at 405 nm reflected this reaction (Fig. 1 A). The kinetic difference spectrum obtained 20 ms after the pulse is similar to that of the difference spectrum of the oxidized minus reduced forms of cytochrome b 561 (Fig. 1 B). It is therefore concluded that MDA radical reacts with the reduced form of cytochrome b 561 to produce the oxidized form, as shown in Reaction 1. MDA·̄+Fe2+→H+AsA−+Fe3+ REACTION1For determination of the rate constant of Reaction 1, the concentration of MDA radical was lowered to 1–2 μm MDA radical, and the cytochrome b 561 concentration was varied between 46 and 100 μm. Fig. 2 shows the concentration dependence of cytochrome b 561 on the apparent rate constants. From the slope of Fig. 2, the second-order rate constant of the reaction was calculated to be 2.6 × 106m−1 s−1 at pH 7.0. This value is in good agreement with the one reported previously (1.2 × 106m−1 s−1 at pH 7.0) in which a steady-state kinetics method was used employing chromaffin vesicle membranes and an AsA− -ascorbate oxidase system (7Kelley P.M. Jalukar V. Njus D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19409-19413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 2Concentration dependence of the apparent rate constants of the reaction of the reduced form of cytochromeb 561 with MDA radical. The rates were determined by the absorption change at 561 nm. The reaction medium contained 5 mm AsA−, 1% β-octyl glucoside, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, and 1–2 μm MDA radical.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Subsequently, the initial changes in absorbance reversed in the time range of seconds (Fig. 3), indicating that re-reduction of cytochrome b 561occurred. The rate constant of this process increased with increases in the concentration of AsA− (data not shown). This indicates that the reduction process is a consequence of a bimolecular reaction of AsA− with the oxidized form of cytochromeb 561, as shown in Reaction 2. AsA−+Fe3+→MDA·̄+Fe2++H+ REACTION2The second-order rate constant of the reaction was calculated to be 8 × 102m−1s−1 at pH 7.0. The value is also good agreement with the value reported previously (4.5 × 102m−1 s−1) in which a stopped-flow method was employed to analyze the electron transfer reaction from AsA− to oxidized cytochromeb 561 in chromaffin vesicle membranes (7Kelley P.M. Jalukar V. Njus D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19409-19413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Jalukar V. Kelley P.M. Njus D. J. Biol.

Experimental conditions were the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The effects of pH on the oxidation rates of cytochromeb 561 with MDA radical and for reduction with AsA− were examined. It is evident that pH profiles for the oxidation and the reduction reactions are different, as shown in Fig. 4. The rate constant for the oxidation of cytochrome b 561 increased with decreasing pH. The maximum reaction rate of 4.3 × 106m−1 s−1 was obtained at pH 5.5. The pH-dependent change could be fitted to a single deprotonation process with a pK a value of 6.7. In contrast, the rate constants of the reduction of cytochromeb 561 increased with increasing pH in the range of 5 to 6.5 and then decreased with increasing pH in the range of 7 to 8. The maximum reaction rate constant of 8 × 102m−1 s−1 was obtained around pH 6.8.Figure 4pH dependence of the rate constants of the reaction of MDA radical with the reduced form of cytochromeb 561 (A) and the reaction of AsA− with the oxidized form of cytochrome b 561 (B).Experimental conditions were the same as in Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To elucidate the contribution of two heme b centers in the electron transfer reaction, MDA radical concentration dependence was examined. Under the experimental conditions employed, the concentration of MDA radical could be varied between 2 and 20 μm by attenuating the dose of the electron beam whereas the concentration of the reduced cytochrome b 561was maintained constant at 12 μm. As shown in Fig. 5, the oxidized cytochromeb 561 by the reaction (at 20 ms after the pulse) increased with increasing the concentration of MDA radical up to 5 μm, and it reached a plateau in the range 8 to 20 μm. A distinct inflection was observed at a point of ∼0.5 eq of MDA radical to cytochrome b 561. It is noteworthy that only half of the heme center could be oxidized with an excess concentration of MDA radical.Figure 5MDA radical concentration dependence on the oxidation of cytochrome b 561 observed after pulse radiolysis. The reaction mixture contained 12 μm cytochrome b 561, 5 mm AsA−, 1% β-octyl glucoside, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In a previous report, we showed that incubation of oxidized cytochromeb 561 in a mild alkaline condition specifically depletes the electron-accepting ability from AsA− for about one-half of the heme centers (15Okuyama E. Yamamoto R. Ichikawa Y. Tsubaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 A shows the visible spectra of cytochrome b 561 (pre-treated at pH 8.2 and 7.0, respectively, in the oxidized state) in the presence of AsA−. Addition of 5 mm AsA− to the alkaline treatment of cytochrome b 561 caused a reduction of only about half of the heme centers, whereas all the heme centers of cytochrome b 561 treated at pH 7.0 (control sample) could be reduced. Fig. 6, B andC, shows the absorbance changes at 430 nm after pulse radiolysis of these samples. The absorbance changes of the control sample after the pulse were not affected. For the alkaline-treated sample, on the other hand, the decrease in absorbance at 430 nm after the pulse was very small, although about half of the heme bcenters were in the reduced state. The slower second phase (i.e. the absorbance increase at 430 nm due to the re-reduction of oxidized cytochrome b 561 with AsA−) was completely lost. These results suggest that one of the heme centers, responsible for electron donation to the MDA radical, is selectively modified upon the alkaline treatment.Figure 6Effects of treatment at pH 7.0 (– – –) and pH 8.2 (——) on the visible spectra of cytochromeb 561 (A) and absorbance changes at 430 nm after pulse radiolysis of the treated cytochromeb 561 at pH 7.0 (B) and pH 8.2 (C) in the presence of AsA− and N2O at pH 7.0. Alkaline-treated (at pH 8.2 for 20 h and then restored to pH 7.0) and control (incubated at pH 7.0) samples of cytochrome b 561 in the oxidized state were prepared as described in the text. Solid sodium ascorbate was added (5 mm), and the spectra were recorded immediately. Other conditions were the same as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe present study clearly shows that one of the heme bcenters in cytochrome b 561 specifically reacts with MDA radical, whereas the other does not. This is verified by the MDA radical concentration dependence on the oxidization of hemeb after the pulse as shown in Fig. 5. Almost stoichiometric oxidation of heme b was observed under the condition of [MDA radical] < [1/2 of cytochrome b 561], whereas only one-half of heme b was oxidized at excess MDA radical concentrations. In addition, the distinct functions of two hemeb centers were revealed by pulse radiolysis experiments on the alkaline-treated sample. Our previous report showed that one of the heme centers is very labile to the alkaline treatment, whereas the other heme retains the ability to accept electrons from AsA− (15Okuyama E. Yamamoto R. Ichikawa Y. Tsubaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is likely that one of the two heme centers, which is very labile to the alkaline treatment, participates in the electron donation to MDA radical, because very slight oxidation of the heme center was observed after pulse radiolysis of the alkaline-treated sample.EPR spectra of the purified cytochrome b 561 in the oxidized state showed the presence of two distinct hemeb species (14Tsubaki M. Nakayama M. Okuyama E. Ichikawa Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23206-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One of them shows usual low spin signals and is very similar to those of microsomal cytochromeb 5 (25Ikeda M. Iizuka T. Takao H. Hagihara B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 336: 15-24Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), chloroplast cytochromeb 559 (26Babcock G.T. Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Oertling W.A. Metz J.G. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3638-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), and cytochrome b ofbo-type ubiquinol oxidase (27Tsubaki M. Mogi T. Anraku Y. Hori H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6065-6072Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), all of which are known to have bisimidazole ligands. The other species shows a highly anisotropic low spin signal (gz = 3.70) with a lower redox potential and is very similar to those of cytochrome b of the mitochondrial complex III (28Orme-Johnson N.R. Hansen R.E. Beinert H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Salerno J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2331-2336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and chloroplast cytochromeb 6 (30Bergström J. Andreasson L.-E. Vänngård T. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 71-74Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The presence of two independent heme centers was supported by the observation of two potentiometrically different forms of cytochrome b 561 determined by an optical potentiometric technique (31Apps D.K. Boisclair M.D. Gavine F.S. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We could not identify definitely which heme center is responsible for the electron donation to MDA radical, but it is very likely that the heme center with the lower redox potential (the gz = 3.70 species) participates in the electron-accepting reaction from the extravesicular AsA−. On the other hand, the usual low spin heme species (the gz = 3.14 species) with a higher redox potential is responsible for the electron donation to MDA radical. This assumption is reasonable since the intramolecular electron transfer of cytochromeb 561 occurs from extravesicular to intravesicular to sides. This is also consistent with the result of the alkaline treatment experiment. Indeed, the heme center having the gz = 3.14 signal can be converted to another form (the gz = 2.84 species) upon elevation of pH, whereas the other heme center (the gz = 3.70 species) showed only a slight pH-dependent spectral change (14Tsubaki M. Nakayama M. Okuyama E. Ichikawa Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23206-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar).Following the electron donation to MDA radical from the heme with a higher redox potential, an intramolecular electron transfer to the oxidized heme from the other heme with a higher redox potential should take place. The expected intramolecular electron transfer, however, could not be followed directly by the present method, because the two heme centers have indistinguishable visible spectra (14Tsubaki M. Nakayama M. Okuyama E. Ichikawa Y. Hori H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23206-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 31Apps D.K. Boisclair M.D. Gavine F.S. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 764: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). If the rate of the intramolecular electron transfer (ki) is much faster and the rate-determining step is the oxidation of the heme center with MDA radical (ki > k1 [MDA radical]), the two hemes would be oxidized simultaneously. In the present work, however, only half of the heme in cytochromeb 561 was oxidized under excess MDA radical concentration. This fact indicates that the intramolecular electron transfer must occur later than 1 ms region. In our previous studies, the intramolecular electron transfer in the region of milliseconds was observed for copper-containing nitrite reductase (21Suzuki S. Kohzuma T. Deligeer Yamaguchi K. Nakamura N. Shidara S. Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 11145-11146Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 22Suzuki S. Deligeer Yamaguchi K. Kataoka K. Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Kohzuma T. Shidara S. Iwasaki H. J. Inorg. Biol. Chem. 1997; 2: 265-274Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and cytochrome cd 1 nitrite reductase (23Kobayashi K. Koppenhöfer S. Ferguson S.J. Tagawa S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13611-13616Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the two redox centers in these proteins are only 10 to 20 Å apart (32Godden J.W. Turley S. Teller D.C. Adman E.T. Liu M.Y. Payne W.J. LeGall J. Science. 1991; 253: 438-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar,33Fülöp V. Moir J.W.B. Ferguson S.J. Hajdu J. Cell. 1995; 81: 369-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In cytochrome b 561, the two heme centers are expected to be located on both sides of vesicular membranes (15Okuyama E. Yamamoto R. Ichikawa Y. Tsubaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and therefore the distance between these two redox centers might be 40 to 50 Å. Thus, an intramolecular electron transfer in the range of seconds may be quite reasonable.The pH dependence of the rate constants of the electron transfer reactions (Fig. 4) provides further insight into the function of cytochrome b 561. The optimal pH of the oxidation (pH = 5.5) and the reduction (pH 6.8) of the heme centers of cytochrome b 561 correspond to the physiological pH at the intra- and extravesicular sides, respectively. Recently, we have proposed a plausible structural model of cytochromeb 561 on the basis of a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of seven species (15Okuyama E. Yamamoto R. Ichikawa Y. Tsubaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In the model, there are two fully conserved regions in the sequences; the first conserved sequence (69ALLVYRVFR77) is located on the extravesicular side of α-helical segment, and the second one (120SLHSW124) is located in an intravesicular loop connecting two α-helical segments. Since these conserved sequences are likely to form the binding sites for extravesicular AsA− and intravesicular MDA, respectively, the present results support our proposal that the two heme b centers are located on both sides of the vesicular membranes in close contact with the AsA− - and MDA-binding sites (15Okuyama E. Yamamoto R. Ichikawa Y. Tsubaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).It is important to note that this is the first direct observation of electron transfer between a ferrous hemoprotein and an MDA radical generated by pulse radiolysis. In the previous report, we could not observe such electron transfer reactions with MDA radical for several ferrous hemoproteins (19Kobayashi K. Harada Y. Hayashi K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8310-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), although the reactions are expected to be energetically favorable on the basis of redox potential differences between MDA·̄/AsA−(E m,7 = 330 mV) (34Iyanagi T. Yamazaki I. Anan F.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 806: 255-261Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and hemoproteins (35Iyanagi T. Watanabe S. Anan F.K. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1418-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is evident that, for biological molecules, the occurrence of electron transfer with MDA radical cannot be predicted simply in terms of the redox potentials (19Kobayashi K. Harada Y. Hayashi K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8310-8315Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The highest rate constant for the reaction of MDA radical with biological molecules was obtained for MDA reductase (2.6 × 108m−1s−1) (20Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Sano S. Asada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27551-27554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We have proposed previously that the high rate constant of the enzymatic reaction might be governed by both the specific geometry of substrate within the active site and the redox potential difference. The facilitated electron transfer reaction in MDA reductase is likely to be provided by several cationic amino acid residues near the active site, which may have a role in electrostatic guidance of the anionic MDA radical substrate to the active center (20Kobayashi K. Tagawa S. Sano S. Asada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27551-27554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, in the intravesicular side of cytochromeb 561, there are several conserved positively charged residues located in the loop connecting helices 3 and 4, and the fully conserved sequence (120SLHSW124) follows this region immediately (15Okuyama E. Yamamoto R. Ichikawa Y. Tsubaki M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1383: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).In conclusion, the following unique properties of cytochromeb 561 have now become evident. First, an efficient transmembrane electron transfer is catalyzed by this hemoprotein, using AsA− as a physiological electron supply. Second, the two heme b centers have distinct roles for the electron donation to MDA radical and the electron acceptance from AsA−. Further studies are in progress to reveal the structural properties of this cytochrome. In neurosecretory vesicles, such as adrenal chromaffin vesicles and pituitary neuropeptide secretory vesicles, intravesicular ascorbate (AsA−) 1The abbreviations used are: AsA−, ascorbate; MDA, monode- hydroascorbate. 1The abbreviations used are: AsA−, ascorbate; MDA, monode- hydroascorbate. functions as the electron donor for copper-containing monooxygenases such as dopamine β-monooxygenase and peptidyl-glycine α-amidating monooxygenase (1Njus D. Kelley P.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 235-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Upon these monooxygenase reactions, monodehydroascorbate (MDA) radical is produced by univalent oxidation of AsA− (2Diliberto Jr., E.J. Heckman G.D. Daniels A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12886-12894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Skotland T. Ljones T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 630: 30-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is believed that the intravesicular MDA radical is reduced back to AsA− by membrane-bound cytochromeb 561, and subsequently cytochromeb 561 is reduced by extravesicular AsA− (4Njus D. Knoth J.

https://openalex.org/W2027699869,"Three mammalian bombesin receptor subtypes have been characterized: the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R), the neuromedin B receptor (NMB-R), and bombesin receptor subtype 3 (BRS-3). In a previous report we identified four amino acids that are critical for high affinity binding of bombesin and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) to the GRP-R. These four amino acids are conserved in all species variants of the GRP-R and NMB-R which bind bombesin with high affinity, but they are diverged in BRS-3, the bombesin receptor subtype that binds bombesin with much lower affinity. Substituting these four divergent amino acids in BRS-3 for the conserved amino acids in either GRP-R or NMB-R increased the affinity of the mutated BRS-3 (4ΔBRS-3) for bombesin compared with wild-type BRS-3. We hypothesized that the same four amino acids might be critical for high affinity NMB binding to the NMB-R. In this study we confirm this hypothesis by showing that the affinity of NMB is increased in a mutant BRS-3 receptor (4ΔBRS-3) that contains these four substitutions resulting in an affinity that is close to the affinity of wild-type NMB-R for NMB. In contrast, these four amino acid substitutions in BRS-3 did not result in the formation of a high affinity binding site for the recently described non-peptide NMB-R antagonist PD168368.

Bombesin is an amphibian tetradecapeptide purified from the skin of the European frog Bombina bombina using a smooth muscle contraction bioassay (1Anastasi A. Erspamer V. Bucci M. Experientia (Basel). 1971; 27: 166-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Subsequent to this discovery, many other peptides with structural similarity at their amidated carboxyl termini were isolated from related amphibians and classified into three subfamilies: bombesin, ranatensin, and phyllolitorin (2Erspamer G. Severini V. Erspamer V. Melchiorri P. delle Fave G. Nakajima T. Regul. Pept. 1988; 21: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).

The biological responses elicited by mammalian bombesin-like peptides are diverse, including the secretion of gastrointestinal hormones (e.g. gastrin, neurotensin, cholecystokinin, somatostatin, and enteroglucagon), the regulation of smooth muscle contractility, the modulation of neuronal excitability, and the growth regulation of both normal and neoplastic cells (5Lebacq-Verheyden A.-M.

The biologic responses elicited by bombesin-like peptides in mammalian systems are mediated by high affinity binding of GRP and/or NMB to one or more of the three known mammalian bombesin receptor subtypes: the neuromedin B receptor (NMB-R, or bb1) (12Wada E.

Although the three subtypes share about 50% amino acid sequence identity when their primary amino acid sequences are aligned to maximize identity, the three receptors are pharmacologically distinct. NMB-R binds bombesin and NMB with highest affinity (nanomolar range) and GRP with lower affinity (hundreds of nanomolar range). GRP-R binds bombesin and GRP with highest affinity (nanomolar range) and NMB with lower affinity (hundreds of nanomolar range). In contrast, BRS-3 binds none of the naturally occurring bombesin-like peptides (bombesin, GRP, or NMB) with an affinity higher than micromolar (18Mantey S. Weber C. Sainz E. Akeson M. Ryan R. Pradhan T. Searles R. Spindel E. Battey J.F. Coy D.H. Jensen R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26062-26071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), suggesting that the naturally occurring ligand for BRS-3 may be a mammalian bombesin-like peptide that remains to be elucidated. In previous work, we initiated an assessment of the molecular and structural requirements for high affinity binding of bombesin and GRP to the GRP-R (19Akeson M. Sainz E. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17405-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To identify candidate amino acid residues of importance for high affinity binding, we reasoned that: 1) many of the amino acid residues involved in binding would be found primarily in the three extracellular loops and seven transmembrane domains of the receptor because the ligand approaches the receptor from the extracellular space, and 2) some of the amino acids critical for high affinity binding would be conserved among all species variants of the bombesin receptors that bind peptide ligands with high affinity (GRP-R and NMB-R) but would diverge in BRS-3, a bombesin receptor subtype that binds none of the known naturally occurring bombesin peptides with high affinity. Using these criteria, four amino acids (Arg288, Gln121, Pro199, and Ala308) were identified which, when changed in the GRP-R to resemble their counterpart in BRS-3, resulted in a loss of affinity for bombesin. To confirm the importance of these four amino acids for high affinity binding, these same four amino acid residues in BRS-3 (His294, Arg127, Ser205, and Ser315) were changed to resemble their counterpart in the GRP-R, thereby creating a mutant BRS-3 called 4ΔBRS-3. If these four amino acids are critical for high affinity binding, we predicted that 4ΔBRS-3 would bind bombesin and GRP with higher affinity than wild-type BRS-3, thereby showing a gain of function. Changing these four amino acids resulted in a roughly 100-fold increase in the affinity for bombesin and GRP, providing conclusive evidence for the importance of these residues in high affinity binding to the GRP-R. Given the structural similarity between mammalian bombesin peptide ligands and their receptors, we hypothesized that some or all of these four amino acids conserved between GRP-R and NMB-R may be important for high affinity binding of NMB to the NMB-R. In this paper, we explore the importance of these four amino acids by creating a receptor structure that can bind NMB with high affinity. In addition, we compare the importance of these same four amino acids for high affinity binding of agonists with their importance in high affinity binding of a recently described non-peptide bombesin receptor antagonist, PD168368 (20Eden J.M.

These cDNA fragments encoding the entire coding sequences of each receptor were cloned into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego) or a modified version of pcD2 (21Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). To generate point mutations in these cDNAs, we initially used the ChameleonTMdouble-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit as suggested by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In our hands, the Chameleon procedure generated an unacceptable number of random mutations. Therefore, we introduced subsequent amino acid substitutions in BRS-3 with the QuickChangeTM kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions, except that the DpnI digestion was incubated overnight. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the entire coding region of all receptor mutants was performed on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 373, Applied Biosystems Inc, Foster City, CA) to verify the presence of the desired mutation sequence and to confirm that there were no unwanted amino acid sequence changes introduced during the mutagenesis procedure. Balb 3T3 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were seeded in a 24-well plate at a density of 30,000 cells/well and grown overnight at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) qualified fetal bovine serum. The following morning cells were transfected with 3 μg of plasmid DNA and 18 μg of LipofectAMINE in Opti-MEM I for 1 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. 24 h after transfection, the cells were released from the 24-well plates by treatment with trypsin-EDTA and seeded at varying densities ranging from 100 to 10,000 cells/10-cm diameter dish (Falcon, Becton Dickinson). 48 h after transfection the cells were placed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, and 800 μg/ml G418, and selection continued for 10–14 days.

Briefly, cells were seeded at 30,000 cells/well in a 24-well plate, and the following day the serum in the culture medium was reduced from 10% to 0.25% to induce a relatively quiescent cell population. 48 h after seeding the cells, fresh medium containing 0.25% serum and 3 μCi/ml myo-[2-3H]inositol (22 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) was added for 24 h. The cells were washed and incubated in a modified HEPES buffer containing 10 mmLiCl for 30 min and then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C with various concentrations of NMB. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.1% v/v HCl in methanol, and total [3H]inositol phosphates were isolated by anion exchange chromatography (AG 1-X8, Bio-Rad).

Furthermore, the K i for NMB displacing 125I-BRS-3 binding to the wild-type NMB-R is 2.6 ± 0.7 nm, which is experimentally indistinguishable from the K dvalue for NMB displacing [125I-d-Tyr0]NMB (3.0 ± 0.2 nm) (Table I). This quantitative similarity between K i andK d values for the two radioligands suggests that these two tracers are occupying similar if not identical binding pockets. The K i for NMB displacing125I-BRS-3 from the wild-type BRS-3 receptor is very high (3,450 ± 610 nm) (Fig. 3 and Table I); thisK i value is decreased to 81 nm when two amino acids in BRS-3 are changed to resemble those found at the same location in NMB-R (BRS-3 R127Q, H294R) (2ΔBRS-3 in Fig. 3 and TableI). When all four key amino acids are altered in BRS-3 (BRS-3 R127Q, H294R, S205P, S315A) to resemble their counterparts in NMB-R, there is an additional shift to high affinity (4ΔBRS-3; Fig. 3 and TableI). To demonstrate that each amino acid in the set of four contributed to increased NMB affinity for 4ΔBRS-3, we added the point mutations sequentially to hBRS-3. As predicted, each additional substitution resulted in higher NMB affinity (Table I).Table IBinding affinities of wild-type BRS-3, mutated BRS-3, and wild-type NMB-RReceptorNMB affinity125I-BRS-3 binding125I-d-Tyr0-NMB bindingnmWild-type NMB-R2.6 ± 0.73.0 ± 0.24ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S205P, S315A)15.9 ± 2.99.3 ± 2.33ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S205P)22.0 ± 6.529.4 ± 6.43ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S315A)38.7 ± 1.1N.B.2ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R)81.5 ± 20N.B.1ΔBRS-3 (H294R)165 ± 40N.B.1ΔBRS-3 (R127Q)1,352 ± 294N.B.Wild-type BRS-33,450 ± 610N.B.Affinities were calculated by competitive displacement of125I-BRS-3 or 125I-[d-Tyr0]-NMB tracers by NMB.

The experiments above and the experiments examining GRP binding to its native receptor (19Akeson M. Sainz E. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17405-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) relied upon agonist displacement of125I-BRS-3 tracer. Although we are confident that this tracer occupies the same binding domain as do the native bombesin-like agonists, it remained possible that the binding domains overlapped but were not identical. To eliminate any ambiguity, we measured agonist affinity for the same panel of wild-type and mutant receptors using125I-[d-Tyr0]NMB tracer. As predicted by the K i data in Table I (left column),125I-[Tyr0]NMB binding to wild-type BRS-3 and to several of the mutant receptors was not detectable above background (Table I, right column). Also as predicted,125I-[Tyr0]NMB binding to 4ΔBRS-3 and to 3ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S205P) was measurable. We were therefore able to establish K d values for NMB binding to these receptors (Table I, right column, and Fig. 4). Remarkably, the K dfor NMB binding to 4ΔBRS-3 is 9.3 nm, very close to the 3.0 nm value obtained for the wild-type NMB-R. We concluded that by altering four amino acids in BRS-3, we have restored most of the structural requirements for high affinity NMB binding. To substantiate these results, we compared NMB-stimulated inositol phosphate hydrolysis mediated by wild-type NMB-R, 2ΔBRS-3, 4ΔBRS-3, and wild-type BRS-3. All four receptors retain the capacity to couple to heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, activating phospholipase C which in turn catalyzes inositol phosphate hydrolysis (Fig. 5). The EC50 values for the four receptors are very different, with much lower concentrations of NMB needed to obtain 50% maximal inositol phosphate hydrolysis when the NMB-R is studied (27 nm; Fig. 5) than is needed for BRS-3 (2,850 nm; Fig. 5). As expected, 4ΔBRS-3 has an EC50 for inositol phosphate hydrolysis closer to the NMB-R (313 nm; Fig. 5), whereas 2ΔBRS-3 (1,042 nm; Fig. 5) is shifted toward the value obtained for wild-type BRS-3 (2,850 nm; Fig. 5). These data are summarized in TableII, demonstrating that the rank order of potency for NMB-stimulated inositol phosphate hydrolysis mediated by these four receptors mirrors the affinity of the four receptors for NMB. In addition, these results indicate that all four receptors retain the capacity to couple with appropriate G-proteins and stimulate appropriate downstream effector cascades.Table IITotal [3H]inositol phosphate release stimulated by NMB and BRS-3 in Balb cells expressing wild-type and mutated receptorsReceptorNMBnmWild-type BRS-32,850 ± 872ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R)1,042 ± 814ΔBRS-3 (R127Q, H294R, S205P, S315A)313 ± 48Wild-type NMB-R27 ± 2Values represent EC50 expressed as mean ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments.

These compounds show a higher affinity for NMB-R than GRP-R (20Eden J.M. Hall M.D. Higginbottom M. Horwell D.C. Howson W. Hughes J. Jordan R.E. Lewthwaite R.A. Martin K. McKnight A.T. O'Toole J.C.

To determine if the same structural requirements are needed for binding NMB and the NMB-R antagonist, we measured theK i values for unlabeled antagonist displacing the binding of 125I-d-Tyr0-NMB and125I-BRS-3 (Fig. 6). Note that the K i for the antagonist PD168368 is high affinity for the NMB-R and very low affinity for BRS-3 (Fig. 6 and Table III). If the structural requirements for high affinity NMB and PD168368 binding were very similar, it was predicted that the K i for PD168368 binding to 4ΔBRS-3 would be shifted away from the value obtained for wild-type BRS-3 and toward the higher affinity value observed in the wild-type NMB-R. In fact, the ligand displacement curves for PD168368 displacing 125I-BRS-3 binding to BRS-3 and 4ΔBRS-3 are nearly superimposable (Fig. 6). These data indicate that the structural requirements for binding the NMB-R antagonist PD168368 and NMB may be overlapping but are clearly distinct.Table IIIKi values for PD168368 in wild-type NMB-R, BRS-3, and 4ΔBRS-3125I-NMB125I-BRS 3nmWild-type NMB-R37 ± 420 ± 34ΔBRS-31760 ± 2942425 ± 376Wild-type BRS-3N.B.3625 ± 186K i values were calculated by competitive displacement of 125I-BRS-3 or 125I-NMB tracers by the NMB antagonist PD168368.

In this work, we show that four conserved amino acids known to be important for high affinity binding of GRP and bombesin to the GRP-R are also critical for high affinity NMB binding to NMB-R. Altering these four amino acids in BRS-3, a low affinity bombesin receptor, to their counterpart positions in NMB-R resulted in a several hundredfold increase in affinity of the BRS-3 mutant (4ΔBRS-3) for NMB. The affinity for NMB binding to 4ΔBRS-3 (9.3 nm) approaches its affinity for the wild-type NMB-R (3.0 nm). A conceptually similar study of opioid receptors was reported recently (25Meng F. Taylor L.P. Hoversten M.T. Ueda Y. Ardati A. Reinscheid R.K. Monsma F.J. Watson S.J. Civelli O. Akil H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32016-32020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) where amino acids that directly influenced high affinity opioid agonist binding were identified. In both this study and the opioid receptor study, correlation between amino acid changes and gain of function (increase in affinity) provide persuasive evidence that the amino acids under examination are a specific component of the structural requirement for high affinity binding. Studies that argue a direct role for specific amino acids in agonist binding based on loss of affinity alone are less compelling because a loss of function could result from a number of changes in the receptor (e.g.protein stability, membrane trafficking, proper folding) other than formation of the high affinity ligand binding pocket. In a similar study of GRP binding to 4ΔBRS-3, the affinity for binding was improved over the affinity observed in wild-type BRS-3 (370 nm, 4ΔBRS-3; >10,000 nm, wild-type BRS-3 (19Akeson M. Sainz E. Mantey S.A. Jensen R.T. Battey J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17405-17409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar)) but was not restored to a value approaching the affinity of the wild-type GRP-R for GRP (3.5 nm (26Benya R.V. Fathi Z. Kusui T. Pradhan T. Battey J.F. Jensen R.T. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 235-245PubMed Google Scholar)). Comparing the results of GRP and NMB binding to 4ΔBRS-3, it appears that the four amino acid substitutions in BRS-3 result in a binding pocket that more closely approximates the high affinity NMB binding site than the GRP binding site. This difference points to the existence of additional residues in BRS-3 that need to be altered to provide the structural requirements for high affinity binding of GRP. We speculate that amino acids that provide the structural requirements for selective high affinity binding of GRP to GRP-R may be consensus differences in the GRP-R, NMB-R, and BRS-3 found in the extracellular loops and transmembrane domains. Future site-directed mutagenesis experiments changing additional amino acids in 4ΔBRS-3 to resemble their counterparts in GRP-R will be needed to test this hypothesis. Although 4ΔBRS-3 shows high affinity for NMB, the four amino acid substitutions do not result in high affinity binding of the non-peptide NMB-R antagonist PD168368. This result is unexpected because the strategy used to design PD168368 (20Eden J.M. Hall M.D. Higginbottom M. Horwell D.C. Howson W. Hughes J. Jordan R.E. Lewthwaite R.A. Martin K. McKnight A.T.

Lett. 1997; 6: 2617-2622Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar) involved: 1) defining the minimum active fragment of NMB agonist peptide; 2) identifying the three amino acids in NMB in this minimum fragment which were most crucial for binding; and 3) appending the side chains of these three most important amino acids onto a small molecule template. Clearly, this strategy for antagonist design relies heavily on incorporating structural features critical for NMB agonist binding to NMB-R, and it would be expected that sequence changes in BRS-3 which improve affinity for NMB would be likely to improve affinity for PD168368. However, we observed a very different result: 4ΔBRS-3 has a ligand displacement curve for increasing concentrations of PD168368 which is indistinguishable from BRS-3 shifted to more than 100-fold lower affinity than NMB-R. This suggests that PD168368 and NMB have overlapping but distinct structural requirements for high affinity binding. Other investigators have compared the binding sites for peptide agonists and non-peptide antagonists using several other G-protein-coupled peptide receptors, including the neurokinin 1 receptor (substance P receptor) (27Fong T.M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16533-16536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In all three receptors, each of the six studies concluded that the binding sites for non-peptide antagonists were distinct from natural peptide agonists. However, it should be noted that for these three receptors, the antagonists were obtained by random screening of compounds rather than by designing the antagonist based on known structural features of the peptide agonist shown to be essential for high affinity binding. The binding constant of 4ΔBRS-3 for NMB is only 3-fold lower than in NMB-R, indicating that the four amino acids changed in 4ΔBRS-3 may provide much of the structural requirements for high affinity NMB binding. If some or all these four amino acids are contact points in the binding pocket, it may be possible to create a NMB agonist binding pocket in a heterologous G-protein-coupled receptor outside the bombesin receptor subfamily by making the same changes in the heterologous receptor which were made in 4ΔBRS-3. The ability to create an agonist binding site on a heterologous G-protein-coupled receptor would be useful in studying the function and signal transduction pathways of some of the numerous “orphan” G-protein-coupled receptors where no agonist is known. Additional studies will be needed to determine if these four amino acids are both necessary and sufficient for high affinity NMB binding to receptors outside the bombesin subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors.

The mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGFIIR) plays an important role in early fibrogenesis by participating in the activation of latent transforming growth factor-β, a potent inducer of the matrix proteins in activated stellate cells that define the fibrotic phenotype. In this study we examined hepatic stellate cell regulation of M6P/IGFIIR expression and found that M6P/IGFIIR mRNA transcript levels increased in stellate cells from rats exposed to carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), a potent fibrogenic stimulant. Two E-boxes residing in the proximal promoter of M6P/IGFIIR were found to each bind a novel 75-kDa transcription factor (P75) in quiescent stellate cells of normal livers. This E-box binding was down-regulated as an early response in stellate cells exposed to CCl4, coinciding with increased M6P/IGFIIR transcript levels. Mutagenized E-boxes in M6P/IGFIIR promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter constructs produced a substantial increase in reporter expression when compared with the corresponding native promoter-CAT construct when transfected in culture-activated stellate cells, suggesting P75's role as a repressor.

The results indicate P75's participation in the regulation of M6P/IGFIIR transcription in hepatic stellate cells during fibrogenesis. During hepatic fibrogenesis the hepatic stellate cell becomes activated, transforming from a fat-storing quiescent cell into a myofibroblast-like cell, devoid of fat stores and overproducing type I collagen as well as other matrix proteins that contribute to the fibrotic phenotype (1Davis B.H. Kresina T. Clin. Lab. Med. 1996; 16: 361-375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This fibrogenic process is not limited to the liver as parallel pathways exist in most solid organs (e.g.kidney, lung, and heart) during pathologic fibrotic states (2Houglum K. Buck M. Alcorn J.

The activation of TGF-β is substantially enhanced by the binding of latent TGF-β to the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor (M6P/IGFIIR) (7Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl.

This region was selected for study because it contains two E-boxes, which are often involved in transcriptional regulation (19Atchley W. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E-boxes are transcription factor binding elements that conform to a CANNTG motif and bind proteins that carry a basic helix-loop-helix structural domain, of which more than 200 have been found, categorized into five classes according to the basic helix-loop-helix domain amino acid sequence (19Atchley W. Fitch W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5172-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The specificity of E-box binding relies not only on the central two nucleotides of the CANNTG sequence, but also in the one or two nucleotides immediately flanking CANNTG (21Fisher F. Crouch D.H.

Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The proximal promoter elements of M6P/IGFIIR were initially investigated using C3H 10T1/2 cells by Liu et al. (20Liu D. Mittanck D. Kim S. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar), showing that Myc bound the 3′ E-box and that both E-boxes participated in promoting transcription. In hepatic stellate cells, the M6P/IGFIIR mRNA transcript was up-regulated both in rats exposed to CCl4 and in culture-activated stellate cells. In examining the M6P/IGFIIR proximal promoter, two E-boxes were found to bind a 75-kDa protein (P75). Activation of stellate cells markedly reduces binding of P75, concomitant with the up-regulation of M6P/IGFIIR transcription within 48 h after exposure to CCl4. Mutations of the E-boxes in CAT reporter constructs result in significantly higher expression in transfected stellate cells activated in culture. The putative repressor P75 appears to be a novel transcription factor as its molecular mass of 75 kDa is considerably higher than those of other known CACGTG-binding factors. Hepatic stellate cells were isolated from Sprague-Dawley male rats by previously described methods (25Friedman S.L. Roll F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 8681-8689Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 26Davis B.H. Pratt B.M. Madri J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10280-10286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were either used directly for RNA isolation or nuclear extract preparation, or for culture on tissue culture flasks precoated with type I collagen and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10% newborn calf serum (10/10 media) (27Davis B.H. Vucic A. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 788-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cultures were passaged after reaching confluence; experiments were carried out with cells between passage 2 and 6. Cells quiescent in culture were prepared from serum-activated cultured cells in passage 3 in which medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum. Cells were incubated in serum-deprived medium for 60 h before harvesting. Cells used in CCl4 studies were harvested either 6, 16, 24, 48, or 72 h after a single administration by gavage of 2 μl/g of a 1:1 CCl4:mineral oil preparation. RNA was isolated using trireagent (Sigma). 1 ml trireagent per rat was used for freshly harvested stellate cells or 4 ml per 75 cm2confluent cells. Cells were homogenized in trireagent by vortexing, phase separation achieved with addition of 0.1 volume of bromochloropropane (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati OH), and 12,000 × g centrifugation. RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase with addition of isopropanol at 0.5 volume of the original trireagent volume. RNA was quantitated spectrophotometrically. RNA was isolated from stellate cells in the following conditions: from normal rat liver or from livers exposed to CCl4 for 6 or 48 h, from stellate cells culture-activated in 10/10 medium or made quiescent in serum-deprived medium for 60 h. Single stranded RNA probe complimentary to M6P/IGFIIR mRNA nucleotides 836–1247 was synthesized with α-[32P]UTP using the MAXIscript kit (Ambion, Austin TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The template for RNA synthesis was generated by PCR with a T7 promoter linked to the downstream primer. Primers used were 5′-CAGGCTCGTTCTGACTTATG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGcttcctgctattttgac-3′, the T7 promoter is underlined and the M6P/IGFIIR sequence is in small capitals. The T7 promoter and flanking nucleotides were described in the MAXIscript kit manual. The M6P/IGFIIR rat cDNA used for the PCR template was kindly provided by Richard G. MacDonald (9Macdonald R. Pfeffer S.R. Coussens L. Tepper M.A. Brocklebank C.M. Mole J.E. Anderson J.K. Chen E. Czech M.P. Ullrich A. Science. 1988; 239: 1134-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). PCR DNA was ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in water, and used directly in RNA synthesis without further purification. The template for rat glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was obtained from Ambion and yields a 316-bp protected fragment. The synthesized RNA probes were gel purified in 5% 19:1 acrylamide, 8 m urea; RNA probes were eluted from the cut bands overnight in 0.5 mNH4OAc, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, at 30 °C; radioactivity of the eluted probes was measured by scintillation counting. To account for probable differences in mRNA abundance the GAPDH probe was labeled at 1000 times less specificity than the M6P/IGFIIR probe by adding cold UTP to the transcription reaction. Ribonuclease protection was carried out with the RPA II kit (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. 18,000 cpm of M6P/IGFIIR probe and 11,000 cpm of GAPDH probe were added to 8 μg of whole RNA, incubated for 15 h at 45 °C, RNased with 1:100 dilution of the RNase provided by the kit, and run on a 5% 19:1 native acrylamide gel. M6P/IGFIIR probe was hybridized to yeast RNA provided with the kit and RNased as a negative control. Unhybridized single-stranded M6P/IGFIIR and GAPDH probes were boiled and quick cooled before adding to the gel. The dried gel was exposed to a phosphorimaging system (PhosphorImager SI, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale CA); the radioactivity in each band was quantitated by computer-aided densitometry of the phosphorimage using IPLab Gel (Signal Analytics Corp). The marker is DNA and so its migration relative to RNA is approximate. Nuclear extracts (5 μg/lane) (method described in Ritzenthaler et al. (28Ritzenthaler J. Goldstein R. Fine A. Smith B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13625-13631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) were incubated with32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (Operon Technologies, Inc.) and electrophoresed on a native 6% 80:1 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The probes used for gel shifts are shown in Fig. 2 A. Competition assays were performed with cold probes at a 100 times concentration. Densitometry was performed with IPLab Gel. The integrity of the extracts was determined by probing them with a double-stranded 32P-labeled Sp1 concensus (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) for a gel shift assay, resulting in distinct Sp1 shifts from all extracts (data not shown). Stellate cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies Inc.), and cell extract handling, extraction, quantitation, and CAT measurements were performed as described previously (29Chen A. Beno D.W.A. Davis B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25994-25998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). CAT data was normalized by making results of −2824 CAT transfections = 1 and adjusting for transfection efficiency determined by co-transfection of a β-galactosidase reporter. The level of β-galactosidase expression was determined by a chemiluminescence assay kit (Tropix, Bedford MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The original M6P/IGFIIR promoter DNA was kindly provided by Peter Rotwein in a luciferase reporter plasmid (30Szebeny G. Rotwein P. Genomics. 1994; 19: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The M6P/IGFIIR promoter sequence was removed by restriction endonuclease digestion and subcloned into a pUC19-based reporter plasmid containing the CAT gene. The full-length promoter includes sequence to −2824 of the M6P/IGFIIR 5′-flanking region plus 109 bp of the 5′-untranslated region. Deletion mutants of the promoter were constructed utilizing a unique SnaBI site at −2808 double-digested with a variety of downstream sites to remove promoter segments and create truncated promoter-CAT plasmids. BstEII,PshAI, and PmlI were used to make the −716del, −11del, and −4del plasmids, respectively. The full-length promoter was mutagenized by a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis described by Ho et al. (31Ho S. Hunt H. Horton R. Pullen J. Pease L. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The primers used to mutagenize both 5′ and 3′ E-boxes changed the CACGTG E-box sequence toTTCGGA. The mutagenized PCR product contained the endogenous PstI/KpnI restriction sites found in the promoter which were used to subclone the PCR product into the native M6P/IGFIIR promoter. The two flanking PCR primers used for mutagenesis were as follows: 5′-GGTTGTCAGGCCTCG-3′, 5′-GCCAAGCTGATCCTCT-3′; the central two primers for 5′ E-box mutagenesis: 5′-TCCTGCTTCCGAAACGTCCTCGTT-3′, 5′-AGGACGTTTCGGAAGCAGGAGGCG-3′; the central two primers for 3′ E-box mutagenesis:5′-GGAGCGTTCCGAAACCTGAGTCGG-3′, 5′-CTCAGGTTTCGGAACGCTCCGGGG-3′. The mutated nucleotides are underlined. All mutagenized plasmids were sequenced to ensure there were no unintentional mutations produced by PCR, as well as to ensure the correct introduction of the mutated nucleotides into the promoter sequence. The plasmid containing both mutated E-boxes (5′/3′ mutEbox) was constructed by taking the plasmid containing the 3′-mutated E-box (3′ mutEbox) and carrying out a second mutagenesis to incorporate the 5′-mutated E-box. The inability of the mutant TTCGGA sequence to bind the E-box shifted bands was tested with the same 20 mers shown in Fig. 2 A with TTCGGA substituted for CACGTG. These double-stranded oligomers were used as cold competitors in 5′ and 3′ E-box gel shifts. A 200-fold excess of the mutated E-box oligonucleotides was unable to compete with either the 5′ or 3′ E-boxes for binding. Two gels were run and blotted onto nitrocellulose as in a standard Western assay (32Sambrook J. Fitsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18.60-18.66Google Scholar). 100 μg of quiescent and 72-h CCl4 nuclear extracts for each gel were boiled and run in Tris/glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose in a Tris/glycine/SDS buffer. The blots were incubated for 0.5 h at room temperature in a renaturation buffer of 5 mm dithiothreitol in gel shift binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 50 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). The renaturation buffer was then replaced with fresh buffer and non-fat milk added to 5%. This was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. The buffer was again replaced with 0.25% milk in fresh binding buffer. The blots were then incubated another 0.5 h and moved to 4 °C, and 2 μg of labeled 5′ E-box or 3′ E-box probe were added and incubated for approximately 16 h. The DNA was end-labeled with γ-[32P]ATP, 6000 Ci/mmol, and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). The blots were washed twice in binding buffer with 500 mm NaCl without poly(dI-dC), once in buffer with 250 mm NaCl, and exposed to film. Extract integrity was determined by probing both quiescent and 72-h extracts with an Sp1 concensus (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′) in a gel shift assay, resulting in distinct Sp1 shifts from both extracts (data not shown). Detection and quantitation of M6P/IGFIIR mRNA in hepatic stellate cells was carried out with a ribonuclease protection assay (Fig. 1). The quantitation of M6P/IGFIIR mRNA was adjusted to GAPDH levels to account for differences in the amount of target RNA used. M6P/IGFIIR mRNA was present in stellate cells from normal liver (Fig. 1 A, lane 1). A 2.5-fold increase in the M6P/IGFIIR transcript level in stellate cells occurs by 48 h after exposure of rats to CCl4 (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1–3, and B, bars Q, 6, and48). This increase was paralleled in vitro, where culture activated stellate cells have a 1.8-fold increase in M6P/IGFIIR transcript when compared with RNA from serum deprived cells and a 2.8-fold increase compared with stellate cells from normal liver (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 4, and 5, andB, bars Q, 0%, and CA). The M6P/IGFIIR probe hybridized to stellate cell RNA without GAPDH (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) yields a protected band migrating the same distance as the upper bands of lanes 1–5. Denatured single-stranded M6P/IGFIIR and GAPDH probes migrate slightly above their double-stranded counterparts (Fig. 1 A, lane 7), and the M6P/IGFIIR probe does not hybridize to any yeast sequence (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). Protein binding to the two proximal E-boxes was examined in stellate cells using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Each E-box probe consisted of two 20-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides of native DNA sequence each containing the E-box hexamer plus their respective seven flanking nucleotides found in the M6P/IGFIIR promoter (Fig. 2 A). The oligonucleotides were radioactively labeled and used as gel shift probes with nuclear extracts from freshly harvested stellate cells. The 3′ E-box was bound by protein in a single shifted band from quiescent nuclear extract (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). The 5′ E-box was bound by protein in two distinct shifted bands from quiescent nuclear extract (Fig. 2 C, lane 1). The upper band of the 5′ E-box shift corresponds to the single-shifted band of the 3′ E-box gel shift (Fig. 2 E). To assess the relevance of E-box binding to in vivo fibrogenesis, gel shifts were performed using nuclear extracts from freshly isolated stellate cells taken from rats exposed to CCl4 during the previous 6, 16, 24, 48, or 72 h. CCl4 treatment produced a down-regulation, or decrease in E-box binding activity, of both E-box binding proteins (Fig. 2, B, lanes 3–9, and C,lanes 3–11). A computer-aided densitometry scan shows the decrease in protein binding occurring by 24–48 h after CCl4 administration (Fig. 2 D). Fig. 2 E shows cold 5′ E-box and 3′ E-box competing with labeled 3′ E-box and 5′ E-box probes for binding quiescent nuclear extracts. Cold 5′ E-box competes out the 3′ E-box shifted band. However, cold 3′ E-box can only compete the upper band of the two complexes shifted by 5′ E-box (lane 3). This indicates that each E-box has a distinct binding specificity despite similarities in sequence. Nuclear extracts from stellate cells in culture (Fig. 3) contain the same (upper) band as the 3′ and 5′ E-box gel shifts in Fig. 2, B andC, but the lower band seen in the 5′ E-box shift (Fig. 2 C) is not present, likely due to differences in in vivo versus in vitro stellate cell proteins. The band shifted by nuclear extract from stellate cells quiesced for 60 h in 0% serum is markedly more intense than the band shifted by extract from culture-activated cells (Fig. 3). Importantly, this mimics the in vivo results of Fig. 2, B and C, which showed that CCl4 (in vivo)-activated stellate cells have reduced binding activity. Since M6P/IGFIIR expression is up-regulated less than 48 h after exposure to CCl4, the coincident loss of E-box binding activity in less than 48 h of CCl4exposure suggested that the bound proteins are repressors and that induction of M6P/IGFIIR potentially involves de-repression of the gene. To further explore this possibility, 5′ truncations of the M6P/IGFIIR promoter were carried out that selectively eliminated the E-boxes. These promoter deletions were fused to a CAT reporter and transfected into primary cultures of activated stellate cells (Fig. 4). The full-length M6P/IGFIIR promoter (−2824 wt) is able to induce CAT expression in activated cells as expected. However, with a large 5′ truncation in the promoter (−716del), which leaves E-box function within the promoter less influenced by distal elements, there is a large (6-fold) decrease in CAT activity compared with the full-length −2824 wild type CAT activity. The −11del construct eliminates the 5′ E-box while maintaining an intact 3′ E-box. This reporter responds with a 4.3-fold increase in CAT expression over the −716del construct containing the intact E-boxes, indicating the presence of a repressor 3′ to −716. The −4del construct cuts the 3′ E-box in half and eliminates both E-boxes, resulting in a further increase in CAT activity, a 1.4-fold increase over −11del CAT activity. These findings support the gel shift results and indicate the importance of repressor binding to M6P/IGFIIR E-box elements. Mutagenesis of the E-boxes in the full-length (−2824 to +109) promoter was carried out to characterize E-box function within an intact promoter sequence. Three full-length M6P/IGFIIR reporters were constructed containing mutagenized E-boxes, one construct for each E-box mutagenized individually (5′ mutEbox and 3′ mutEbox) and a third construct containing both E-boxes mutagenized simultaneously (5′/3′ mutEbox). Each mutagenized plasmid was transfected, and the results were compared with the previously transfected plasmids containing only the native sequence (Fig. 4). All three mutagenized constructs resulted in striking increases in CAT activity. When compared with −2824 wild type CAT activity, 5′ mutEbox produced a 2.4-fold increase, 3′ mutEbox produced a 15.3-fold increase, and 5′/3′ mutEbox produced a 7.8-fold increase in CAT activity. The transfection experiments which utilized the mutagenized E-boxes yielded parallel but not identical results (i.e. of dissimilar magnitude) in comparison to E-boxes in truncated promoters and strongly support the evidence of repressor binding to the two proximal E-boxes. We initiated characterization of the E-box binding protein(s) by determination of molecular weight via Southwestern blotting (Fig. 5). Two gels each containing 100 μg of both quiescent stellate cell and 72-h CCl4 nuclear extracts were run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, renatured, and probed with either labeled 5′ E-box or 3′ E-box probe from Fig. 2 A. The 5′ E-box probe bound to a prominent 75-kDa band (P75) from quiescent extract, which is considerably reduced in the 72-h extract, and to a lesser 47-kDa band. The 3′ E-box bound the same 75-kDa band, but not the 47-kDa band, mirroring the gel shift results of Fig. 2, B andC. The identity of the lesser 47-kDa band remains unknown, but it should be noted that it is only the upper band of the in vivo gel shifts that appeared in the in vitro gel shift (Fig. 3), and thus it is likely this upper band contained the protein (P75) that bound the E-boxes in the transfected M6P/IGFIIR plasmids. The ribonuclease protection assay shows an increase in M6P/IGFIIR transcript levels in stellate cells activated by exposure to CCl4. Subsequent experiments define two elements in the proximal promoter of M6P/IGFIIR that are significant to the regulation of M6P/IGFIIR expression by hepatic stellate cells during initial stages of hepatic fibrogenesis. The elements are both CACGTG E-boxes which bind a 75-kDa protein (P75) that is down-regulated in stellate cells as a response to the fibrogenic stimulant CCl4. This down-regulation occurs concomitantly with the up-regulation of M6P/IGFIIR, suggesting 1) repressor activity for P75 and 2) up-regulation of M6P/IGFIIR expression involves a de-repression of the gene. This is supported by functional removal of the E-boxes by mutagenesis resulting in a marked increase in the ability of the M6P/IGFIIR promoter to drive CAT expression in activated stellate cells. The ribonuclease protection assay (Fig. 1) shows that the M6P/IGFIIR mRNA level in stellate cells in vivo increases by as much as 2.5-fold during early fibrogenesis. The detection of M6P/IGFIIR transcript in quiescent stellate cells from normal liver is significant because it was previously undetected on a Northern blot (13De Bleser P. Scott C. Niki T. Xu G. Wisse E. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More importantly, M6P/IGFIIR is required for lysosomal enzyme sorting (33Kaspar D. Dittmer F. Figura K.V. Pohlmann R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), and so its low level expression would be expected. Also, the increased mRNA level parallels the increase in M6P/IGFIIR protein, which peaks in stellate cells at 48 h after CCl4 treatment (13De Bleser P. Scott C. Niki T. Xu G. Wisse E. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The gel shift assays (Fig. 2) show a significant decrease in E-box binding as a result of CCl4 exposure. The decrease appears to begin after h 16 and by 24–48 h there is a marked decrease in binding (Fig. 2, B, lanes 7–9, andC, lanes 7–11, and D). This decrease in repressor binding fits the pattern of change in M6P/IGFIIR mRNA transcript abundance, which increases between 6 and 48 h after exposure to CCl4 (Fig. 1, A, lanes 1–3, and B, bars Q, 6, and48). Thus, the down-regulation of E-box binding would explain, in part, the pattern of transcription for M6P/IGFIIR observedin vivo; as repressor binding decreases, transcription increases. Fig. 2 E shows that the single-shifted band from the 3′ E-box gel shift and the upper band of the 5′ E-box gel shift migrate to identical positions in the gel (lanes 1 and4). The inability of the 3′ E-box to bind protein(s) in the lower band of the 5′ E-box gel shift is further demonstrated by the failure of cold 3′ E-box to compete with 5′ E-box binding the lower band (lane 3) and demonstrates different binding specificities between the two E-boxes. Stellate cells in culture spontaneously transform into the activated phenotype (34Friedman S.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 1828-1835Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Significant to subsequent transfection experiments, the quiescent versus activated change in E-box binding seen in the in vivo extracts is mimicked in cultured stellate cell extracts. Cultured stellate cells in passage 3 quiesced in 0% serum show a marked increase in E-box binding activity; therefore, E-box binding decreases during activation of stellate cells in culture, recapitulating the in vivo response (Fig. 3). M6P/IGFIIR transcript level changes in vitro also mimic the in vivo response, increasing 2.8-fold compared with quiescent cells from the rat and 1.8-fold compared with cells quiescent in culture. It was previously shown that M6P/IGFIIR transcript is detectable in Northern blots of RNA from cultured cells only after 6 days in culture (13De Bleser P. Scott C. Niki T. Xu G. Wisse E. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated quiescent stellate cells become activated at approximately the 6th day of culture (13De Bleser P. Scott C. Niki T. Xu G. Wisse E. Geerts A. Hepatology. 1996; 23: 1530-1537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since the decrease in E-box binding is concomitant with increased M6P/IGFIIR expression, the E-box binding factor appears to be a repressor, and its down-regulation (or deactivation) contributes a de-repression to M6P/IGFIIR gene expression. Fig. 4 shows that both the elimination of the E-boxes in plasmids −11del and −4del as well as their mutagenesis produces an increase in the ability of the promoter to drive CAT expression. The increases in CAT activity from the −11del and −4del plasmids shows not only that the E-box is binding a repressor, but that an inducer is likely to be found downstream of −4 in the 109 bp of the 5′-untranslated region. The functional elimination of the E-boxes in the mutagenized full-length plasmids produced a dramatic increase in CAT activity, a strong demonstration of the repressor function of the E-box binding protein. The large difference in CAT activity between transfected mutagenized plasmids and the deletion plasmids that physically remove the E-boxes is likely due to the remaining full promoter being unencumbered by the E-box repressors, showing the presence of strong transcriptional activators in the 5′-flanking region, which will need to be identified in future studies. Interestingly, the combined effect of the 5′ mutEbox and 3′ mutEbox is not additive, and CAT activity of the 5′/3′ mutEbox is half that of the 3′ mutEbox. However, gel shifts (Fig. 2 E) show that the two E-boxes have binding affinities that are not identical, suggesting they may differ functionally in vivo. Protein-protein interactions of the 5′ P75 may differ from 3′ P75 interactions, which could also explain this nonadditive effect. Of the two bands shifted by the 5′ E-box (Fig. 2 C), only the upper band is shifted by the 3′ E-box (Fig. 2 B). Cultured stellate cell extracts (Fig. 3) also contain only the upper shifted band seen in Fig. 2, B and C. Since it is in the cultured stellate cells that transfections occur, it is likely the protein in this upper (75 kDa) band whose E-box binding is being prevented in the mutagenized plasmids, resulting in the high level CAT expression, and thus it is this protein, P75, that is acting as the repressor, rather than the lower band seen in Fig. 2 C. Southwestern analysis showed both E-box probes bound to a prominent 75-kDa band (P75) from quiescent nuclear extract (Fig. 5). P75 is considerably reduced in the 72-h extract, which supports the results of the gel shift experiments. The minor 47-kDa band was bound by the 5′ E-box (Fig. 5, left panel), but was not bound by the 3′ E-box. This reflects the E-box gel shifts in Fig. 2, with the 5′ E-box shifting two protein complexes and the 3′ E-box shifting only the upper of those two bands. The 75-kDa repressor is a size that does not correspond to any known CACGTG E-box-binding proteins, which range in size from 21 to 59 kDa (22Amati B. Land H. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 23Luo X. Sawadogo M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 24Beckmann H. Su L.-K. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 167-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). A literature search did not reveal any E-box-binding protein in the 75-kDa range. Also, incubating the nuclear extracts with anti-Max, anti-Myc, or anti-upstream stimulatory factor did not result in supershifts in the gel shift assays (data not shown). Thus it is likely that P75 is a novel protein. It is interesting to note that the same promoter elements are used in opposing ways in two different cell types. In C3H 10T1/2 cells, the two M6P/IGFIIR E-boxes promote transcription apparently through Myc binding (20Liu D. Mittanck D. Kim S. Rotwein P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatic stellate cells, on the other hand, use the same E-boxes to repress (and de-repress) transcription of M6P/IGFIIR through regulation of an E-box binding repressor. CCl4 treatment does not abolish repressor binding to the E-boxes in vivo, rather repressor E-box binding is down-regulated. This suggests a fine-tuned regulation of M6P/IGFIIR transcription by hepatic stellate cells in early fibrogenesis. The presence of a repressor which participates in stellate cell regulation of M6P/IGFIIR expression may eventually provide a target for therapeutic intervention in liver fibrosis. Without M6P/IGFIIR, activation of TGF-β is greatly reduced. Through high level expression of specific repressors such as P75, the progression of fibrogenesis could be blocked. We thank J. Vande Vusse for technical assistance, P. Rotwein for the M6P/IGFIIR promoter DNA, and R. G. MacDonald for the M6P/IGFIIR cDNA."
https://openalex.org/W2025495522,"Deletion and mutagenesis of the 5′-flanking region of the human transcobalamin II (TC II) transfected in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells have revealed that TC II promoter activity is: (a) very weak; (b) restricted to a core region (−29 to −163) that contained multiple transcription initiation sites; (c) not dependent on other potential elements, such as a distally localized CCAAT box, a CF1, a HIP1 binding motif and a MED-1 element; (d) modulated weakly by a positive-acting GC box (−568-GAGGCGGTGC) and strongly by a proximal GC/GT overlapping box (−179 CCCCCGCCCCACCCC). Gel shift and immunosupershift analyses demonstrated that both the positive-acting GC box and the negative-acting GC/GT box were recognized by Sp1 and Sp3. Co-transfection studies using Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression plasmids revealed that while Sp1 stimulated, Sp3 repressed Sp1-mediated transactivation of TC II transcription. The proximal GC/GT box also acted as a negative element in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that tissue/cell specific expression of the TC II gene may be controlled by the relative ratios of Sp1 and Sp3 that bind to the GC/GT box and the weak promoter activity of TC II is due to the transcriptional repression caused by the binding of Sp3 to the proximal GC/GT box. Deletion and mutagenesis of the 5′-flanking region of the human transcobalamin II (TC II) transfected in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells have revealed that TC II promoter activity is: (a) very weak; (b) restricted to a core region (−29 to −163) that contained multiple transcription initiation sites; (c) not dependent on other potential elements, such as a distally localized CCAAT box, a CF1, a HIP1 binding motif and a MED-1 element; (d) modulated weakly by a positive-acting GC box (−568-GAGGCGGTGC) and strongly by a proximal GC/GT overlapping box (−179 CCCCCGCCCCACCCC). Gel shift and immunosupershift analyses demonstrated that both the positive-acting GC box and the negative-acting GC/GT box were recognized by Sp1 and Sp3. Co-transfection studies using Sp1 and/or Sp3 expression plasmids revealed that while Sp1 stimulated, Sp3 repressed Sp1-mediated transactivation of TC II transcription. The proximal GC/GT box also acted as a negative element in human chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that tissue/cell specific expression of the TC II gene may be controlled by the relative ratios of Sp1 and Sp3 that bind to the GC/GT box and the weak promoter activity of TC II is due to the transcriptional repression caused by the binding of Sp3 to the proximal GC/GT box. Human transcobalamin II (TC II) 1The abbreviations used are: TC II, transcobalamin II; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; MTIS, multiple transcription initiation sites; Inr, initiator; bp, base pair(s). is a secretory non-glycoprotein of molecular mass of 43 kDa (1Quadros E.V. Rothenberg S.P. Pan Y.C.E. Stein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15455-15460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that functions in the plasma transport of cobalamin (vitamin B12) to all cells. TC II gene is expressed in many types of cells and tissues but at different levels (2Li N. Seetharam S. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1994; 310: 585-590Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Increased levels of plasma TC II have been reported in patients with a variety of diseases (3Jacob E. Baker S.J. Herbert V. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 918-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), indicating that the TC II gene may have a basal expression in many cells, but could be induced under some pathological conditions. Lack of expression or expression of defective forms of TC II leads to the development of intracellular cobalamin deficiency (4Cooper B.A. Rosenblatt D.S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1987; 7: 296-320Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recent studies (2Li N. Seetharam S. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1994; 310: 585-590Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5Li N.

Seetharam S. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1994; 310: 585-590Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Although in many patients studied the great reduction of TC II mRNA is due to nonsense mutations (5Li N. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 6Li N. Rosenblatt D.S. Kamen B.A. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. Hum. Mol.

Genet. 1994; 3: 1835-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), available evidence suggests that TC II deficiency can also result from promoter defects (5Li N. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Despite these studies nothing is known about how the TC II gene expression is regulated. We have recently isolated the human TC II gene and its 5′-flanking region up to about 1 kilobases (7Li N. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 280: 756-764Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis of the mRNA from human kidney revealed multiple transcription initiation sites at the region between nucleotide −128 and −77. The 5′-flanking sequence of the gene is GC-rich, lacks a consensus TATA box, but contains a distally localized CCAAT element (−422/−418). It also contains potential binding sites for a number of transcription factors such as Sp1, CF1, HIP1, Ets-1, and a MED-1 element that have been implicated in the transcription of some TATA-less genes (8Boisclair Y.R. Brown A.L. Casola S. Rechler M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24892-24901Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Riggs K.J. Merrell K.T. Wilson G. Calame K. Mol. Cell.

In order to begin to understand the transcriptional regulation of this important nutrient transporter we have analyzed a number of plasmid constructs with a series of promoter deletions to identify the cis-elements that are important in control of TC II promoter activity. The results of the present study show that TC II gene transcription is not affected by the housekeeping elements HIP1, CF1, or MED-1. However, its transcriptional activity is dependent on sequences surrounding the transcription initiation sites and is regulated positively by a distal GC box (−568/−559), and negatively by a proximal GC/GT overlapping box (−179/−165). The GC/GT box appears to have a dominant negative effect in control of the weak promoter activity of the TC II gene. The promoterless plasmid, pCAT-Basic (Promega, Madison, MI), was used for the preparation of the CAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) fusion reporter constructs. Various deletions of the TC II-promoter segments were generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the pCAT-Basic (pCAT-B) vector by blunt-end ligation at a site upstream from the CAT gene. A total of 11 promoter segments were amplified and the sequences of each pair of primers used for polymerase chain reaction are shown in Table I. The DNA sequence of each of the promoter segments was confirmed by sequencing prior to transfection.Table IPCR primers used in generating TCII promoter segmentsPromoter segmentForward primerReverse primer−1014 −990+37 +15 ‖ ‖ ‖ ‖p1(−1014/+37)5′-ACCTCTTGGGTTCAAGCGATCCTC5′-GGACCCCCAGAAGGAAGAGGAAG−746 −722 ‖ ‖p2(−746/+37)5′-CTCCAGGAGGCTCCCAGCCCTTTCG+37 to +15−511 −488 ‖ ‖p3(−511/+37)5′-TGCAGCTCCCGTTCCACTCCTTG+37 to +15−453 −431 ‖ ‖p4(−453/+37)5′-GGTAAGGAGTACGGGTAGGCACC+37 to +15−330 −309 ‖ ‖p5(−330/+37)5′-GGGCTCTTTAAGCAGGAACGTG+37 to +15−265 −243 ‖ ‖p6(−265/+37)5′-TCCCTTTGTTCCCTACCTCCAGG+37 to +15−163 −141 ‖ ‖p7(−163/+37)5′-CTGCAGACTTAGCCGTGCATTGC+37 to +15+158 +165 ‖ ‖p2.1(−746/+185)−746 to −7225′-GGTCCAGCTAAGCCCAAACTGp6.1(−265/+185)−265 to −243+185 to +165−19 −40 ‖ ‖p6.2(−265/−19)−265 to −2435′-GTGAGCAGTGAGCAAGAATCGG−158 −179 ‖ ‖p6.3(−265/−158)−265 to −2435′-CTGCAGAGGGGTGGGGCGGGGG Open table in a new tab The substitution mutagenesis of GC or GC/GT box in the promoter segment were generated using the QuickChange Site-directed mutagenesis method (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).

The human colon epithelial cell line Caco-2 and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The cells were plated at a density of 1.5 × 106cells/100-mm dish the day before transfection and transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (13Grahm F.L. Van der eb J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). The transfection was performed using 15 μg of promoter-CAT fusion plasmid and 5 μg of an internal control plasmid pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega) for monitoring the transfection efficiency. In addition, promoterless vector pCAT-Basic and promoter-containing plasmid pCAT-Promoter (Promega) were also transfected in each experiment as a negative and positive control, respectively. For co-transfection studies with human Sp1 and Sp3, 5 μg of expression plasmids, pEVR2/CMV/Sp1, and/or pRC/CMV/Sp3 (kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske, Germany) (14Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3843-3851Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), were transfected together with the promoter-CAT fusion plasmid. Each transfection was carried out at least three times. Human chronic myelogenous leukemic K-562 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and transiently transfected by electroporation as follows. The cells in mid-log phase growth (1 × 106 cell/ml) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium at a cell density of 1.4 × 107 cells/ml. Cell suspension (400 μl) were transferred into electroporation cuvette (2 mm diameter) containing 10 μg of the promoter-CAT fusion plasmid and 5 μg of an internal control plasmid, pSV-β-galactosidase. After 10 min incubation at 22 °C, the cuvette was placed in the electroporation apparatus (Electro Cell Manipulator ECM 600, BTX Inc., San Diego, CA) and pulsed at 1000 microfarads, 240 V, and 129 ohms. Cells were then plated in 7 ml of complete medium and incubated at 37 °C for 20 h. After 46 h (Caco-2 and HeLa cells) or 20 h (K-562 cells) of transfections, cells were harvested and extracts were prepared for β-galactosidase and CAT assays. β-Galactosidase activity was measured according to Herbomelet al. (15Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and CAT activity was determined by the method of Gorman et al. (16Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) using [14C]chloramphenicol as a substrate. The acetylated products were separated from the unacetylated products by either thin layer chromatography or liquid scintillation counting as described by Seed and Sheen (17Seed B. Sheen J-Y. Gene. 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). CAT activities were normalized to β-galactosidase activities for the variations of transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Caco-2 cells essentially as described by Dignam et al. (18Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). All buffers contained protease inhibitors including phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), leupeptin (2 μg/ml), antipain (10 μm), and benzamidine (1 mm). Protein concentration of the nuclear extract was determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay method using bovine serum albumin as a standard (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). The promoter segment p6.3 (−265/−158) was cleaved from the plasmid p6.3 (−265/−158)-B by digestion with HindIII and XbaI and labeled with [32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Double-stranded oligonucleotide CI and GI (Table II) were labeled at the 5′-termini with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Labeled probe (∼2 × 104 cpm) was incubated for 15 min at 22 °C with 2.2 μg of nuclear extract in 10 μl of reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μg/ml poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC)). For competition experiments the nuclear extract was incubated with indicated concentrations of double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors (Table II) at 22 °C for 5 min prior to incubation with the probe. For immunosupershift assay, the nuclear extract was preincubated with 1.5 μg of affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against Sp1 or Sp3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 22 °C for 30 min prior to incubation with the probe. The reaction mixture was then subjected to 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 0.5 × TBE buffer (44.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 44.5 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA) at 100 V. The protein-DNA complexes were visualized by autoradiography. To identify regions that are important for the promoter activity, a series of promoter segments were cloned into a promoterless CAT reporter vector, pCAT-B, and the fusion promoter-CAT constructs were transiently transfected into human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells known to express endogenous TC II (20Ramanujam K.S. Seetharam S. Ramasamy M. Seetharam B. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: G416-G422PubMed Google Scholar, 21Li N. Sood G.K. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1219: 515-520Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Initially, seven plasmid constructs with sequential 5′-deletions and a 3′-fixed end (+37) were analyzed and the results are shown in Fig. 1. The longest promoter segments p1 (1039 bp) and p2 (783 bp) revealed maximal promoter activities, but their levels were only 2.4-fold of the baseline activity. Further deletion from −746 to −511 (p3), which contains a putative GC and E-box, resulted in negligible promoter activity, indicating the presence of positive elements in the region −746 to −511. Deletion from −511 to −453 (p4) caused a slight increase of the promoter activity (1.8-fold of the baseline value), suggesting the presence of a weak negative element in this region. Additional deletions from −453 to −330 (p5) containing a CCAAT element and from −330 to −265 (p6) containing a CF1 binding motif did not significantly change the promoter activity. However, deletion from −265 to −163 (p7) which contains two overlapping Sp1 consensus motifs, GC and GT box, caused an increase of the promoter activity almost to the same level as that of the longest promoter segment. The 5′-deletion studies suggested that the TC II promoter activity is weak in Caco-2 cells. However, it is not known whether the weak promoter activities detected using these promoter segments are due to the absence of some important positive elements such as MED-1 (12Ince T.A. Scotto K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30249-30252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) located downstream from the 3′-end point (+37) of these constructs or to the presence of strong negative elements at the 3′-region. In order to test these possibilities, promoter segments with 3′-extension to position +185 (p2.1 and p6.1), which included a perfect match for a MED-1 element (+155/+160), or with 3′-deletions to position −29 (p6.2) and −158 (p6.3) were fused with the CAT reporter vector. Fig. 2 shows the constructs of these promoter segments and their relative CAT activities. The inclusion of the region +37 to +185 to promoter segments p2 and p6 did not increase, but reduced the promoter activities to the baseline. This result indicated that MED-1 is not functional in the transcription of the TC II gene. However, removal of region from +37 to −29 increased the promoter activity from 1.6 (p6) to 2.9 (p6.2), suggesting the presence of negative elements in the region −29 to +37. Further deletions from region −29 to −158 (p6.3), which contains multiple transcription start sites and a potential Ets-1 binding site, eliminated the promoter activity completely. These studies revealed that the TC II promoter activity is weak, its core promoter is limited to the region between −163 and −29, and its activity is regulated by both positive and negative control elements. Since the positive (−746 to −511) and one (−265 to −163) of the negative regions contained a putative GC box (−568 to −559) and a GC/GT box (−179 to −165), respectively, the nuclear factors binding to these two regions were characterized by EMSA. The positive region (−746 to −511) of the TC II promoter contains a putative GC box (−568/−559) GAGGCGGTGC, with one mismatch of nucleotide T instead of G or A at position 8 of the consensus sequence of the GC box (22Counrey A. Tjian R. McKnight S. Yamamoto Y. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 743-769Google Scholar). To test the possible interaction of the putative GC box with Sp1, a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing this region (oligonucleotide CI, see Table II) was synthesized, labeled, and subjected to EMSA and immunosupershift analysis (Fig. 3). Incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide CI with Caco-2 nuclear extracts revealed two major distinct protein-DNA complexes, I and II (lane 2). Both the complexes were abolished when the nuclear extract was preincubated with unlabeled wild-type oligonucleotide, CI (lane 3), but not the mutant oligonucleotide, CI-M (lane 4) in which the GC box was mutated (see sequence in Table II). The competition results suggested that the nuclear proteins interacted specifically with the GC box. Preincubation of the nuclear extracts with antibody to Sp1 resulted in more than 50% shift of the complex I without affecting the mobility of complex II (lane 5), indicating that Sp1 is one of the proteins forming complex I. It is known that the GC box can interact with several human transcription factors other than Sp1. These include Sp3, Sp4, and BTEB2 (23Kingsley C. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4251-5261Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 24Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 25Sogawa K. Imataka H. Yamasaki Y. Kusume H. Abe H. Fujii-Kuriyam Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1527-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). However, among these Sp1-related proteins, only Sp3 is expressed ubiquitously (24Hagen G. Muller S. Beato M. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5519-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether Sp3 contributed to the formation of protein-DNA complex II and/or the rest of the complex I. When the nuclear extracts were preincubated with antibody to Sp3, electrophoresis revealed elimination of complex II and a partial elimination of complex I (lane 6). These observations indicated that complex I was formed as a result of interactions with both Sp1 and Sp3 whereas complex II was formed due to interaction with Sp3 alone and that the positive regulatory region (−746 to −511) interacted with both Sp1 and Sp3. 5′-Deletion analysis of the promoter identified a negative regulatory region from −265 to −163 (Fig. 1). This region contains two potential Sp1 binding motifs, one is an inverted GC and GT overlapping box (−179/−165), CCCCCGCCCCACCCC, and the other is an inverted GC box with two mismatches at position 2 and 10 (underlined) of the consensus sequence of the GC box (−199/−190),TCCCCGCCAC. To identify the functional elements binding to Sp1 or to any other nuclear factors, a DNA fragment (−265 to −158) spanning the entire negative region was labeled and analyzed by EMSA (Fig. 4 A). Three predominant complexes (I–III) were observed when the nuclear extracts were incubated with the labeled probe (lanes 2–3). All three complexes were eliminated (lanes 4–6) by competition with an unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide GI (Table II) which contained the overlapping GC/GT box, but not affected when competition was carried out with 50–1000-fold excess (lanes 7–9) of oligonucleotide GII (Table II) which contained the potential GC box with two mismatches. This result indicated that in the negative regulatory region (−265 to −163), almost all of the nuclear factor binding was due to interactions with the sequence GI. Since the overlapping GC/GT box at position −179 to −134 is not only a potential binding motif for Sp1 but also for AP2 (CCC(A/C)N(G/C)(G/C)) (26Faisst S. Meyer S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), additional competition studies were performed by using oligonucleotides containing consensus sequences for Sp1 and AP2 (see Table II). As shown in Fig. 4 A, the three complexes were competed by Sp1 oligonucleotide (lane 10), but not by AP2 oligonucleotide (lane 11). In order to confirm that the binding of nuclear proteins to the negative regulatory region (−265 to −163) occurred at the sequence GI (−187 to −152), oligonucleotide GI was 32P-labeled and subjected to EMSA (Fig. 4 B). Consistent with the result from Fig. 4 A, three predominant complexes (I–III) were revealed by using the short DNA sequence as a probe (lane 2). All three complexes were competed away with unlabeled oligonucleotide CI (lane 3) which contained the wild-type GC box at the distal region or GI (lane 5), but not with the mutant oligonucleotide CI-M (lane 4) or GI-M (lane 6), in which the GC box or the GC/GT box was mutated (Table II). This result demonstrated specific interactions of the nuclear proteins with the GC or the GT box. Antibody to Sp1 supershifted the complex I almost completely (lane 7) while antibody to Sp3 inhibited the formation of complex II and III (lane 8), indicating that the negative region (−265 to −163) interacts with both Sp1 and Sp3. Taken together, the results shown in Figs. 3 and 4, A andB, have demonstrated that both the GC box in the positive regulatory region and the GC/GT box in the negative regulatory region interact with Sp1 and Sp3. The functional significance of these two regulatory elements was further investigated by transfection of the plasmid constructs containing mutations in the GC or the GC/GT box. To evaluate the relative contribution of the GC (−568/−559) and GC/GT (−179/165) box on the overall promoter activity, mutated GC and/or GC/GT box (Table II) were introduced into plasmid constructs p2-B, p6-B, and p6.2-B, and their ability to drive the expression of the CAT gene was tested in Caco-2 cells. Fig. 5 shows the structure of these constructs and their relative CAT activities. For promoter segment p2, mutations in the distal GC box (construct p2/GCM-B) resulted in an approximate 50% loss of the promoter activity, whereas mutations in the proximal GC/GT overlapping box (construct p2/CTM-B) caused about a 345% increase in the promoter activity. Double mutations at both the distal GC and the proximal GC/GT motifs (construct p2/GCM.CTM-B) resulted in about 300% induction of the promoter activity. These results suggested that the distal GC box in the positive region functions as a positive element and the proximal GC/GT box is responsible for the negative effect of the region from −265 to −163. The repressive effect of the proximal GC/GT box was further tested using shorter promoter segments, p6 and p6.2. As is shown in Fig. 5, the two constructs carrying the mutated GC/GT box (p6/CTM-B and p6.2/CTM-B) led to a 419 and 551% increase in the promoter activity, respectively, confirming the dominant negative role of the proximal GC/GT box. The repressive effect of the proximal GC and GT overlapping box appears to be the result of nuclear proteins binding to either the GC or the GT motif since the EMSA data shown in Fig. 4 B demonstrated that the distal GC box (lane 3) binds to the nuclear proteins as efficiently as the proximal GC/GT box (lane 5). The repressive effect of the proximal GC/GT box on the transcriptional regulation of the TC II gene was also tested in two other cell lines, human chronic myelogenous leukemia K-562 and HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Northern blot analysis using mRNA from K-562, Caco-2, and HeLa cells have shown similar levels of endogenous TC II mRNA in Caco-2 and K-562 cells and its undetectable levels in HeLa cells. 2S. Seetharam, N. Li, and B. Seetharam, unpublished data. Consistent with this observation, transfection using both the long (p2-B) and the short (p6.2-B) promoter fragments resulted in similar levels of the promoter activity in K-562 and Caco-2 cells. In contrast, the long (p2-B) promoter fragment transfected in HeLa cells did not reveal any promoter activity. When the GC/GT box was mutated, the CAT activity with the long (p2/CTM-B) and the short (p6.2/CTM-B) promoter fragments increased 307 and 657%, respectively, in K-562 cells. Very interestingly, in HeLa cells, mutations of the GC/GT box in the long promoter fragment (p2/CTM-B) caused a 432% induction of the CAT activity over the baseline activity detected using its wild-type (p2-B) promoter counterpart. Taken together, these transfections studies have clearly shown that the proximal GC/GT box functions as negative element in multiple cells. It is well known that Sp1 is a transcriptional activator (27Kodonga J.T. Jones K.A. Tijan R. Trends Biochem.

In the present study, we define cis-elements in the 5′-flanking region of the ET-AR gene. Deletion analyses were performed in A7r5 cells, rat vascular smooth muscle cell line, and Chinese hamster ovary cells using ET-AR promoter-luciferase gene constructs including 5 kilobases of the 5′-flanking region. These analyses demonstrated the existence of one negative regulatory element (−2.0 kilobases to −857 bases) and two positive regulatory elements (−137 to −53 and −53 to +251). Gel mobility shift assay revealed a nuclear protein binding to the region (−104 to −78) (R1). DNase I footprinting analysis showed a footprint spanning from −91 to −83 whose sequence is CCCCACCTT (ETA-P1). When a plasmid including R1 fragments (R1 decoy) was co-transfected into A7r5 cells with ET-AR (−137 to +251)-luciferase gene construct, it significantly reduced the luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, R1 decoy down-regulated the endogenous ET-AR mRNA in A7r5 cells by a maximum of 75%. Thus, we identified cis-elements that regulate basal transcriptional activity of the ET-AR gene and proved the feasibility to suppress the expression of the ET-AR gene by the DNA decoy strategy using the positive regulatory element we identified."
https://openalex.org/W2023807517,"Two new analogues of bovine placental lactogen (bPL), bPL(G133K) and bPL(G133R), were expressed in<i>Escherichia coli</i>, refolded, and purified to a native form. Binding experiments, which are likely to represent the binding to site 1 only, to intact FDC-P1 cells transfected with rabbit (rb) growth hormone receptor (GHR) or with human (h) GHR, to Nb2 rat lymphoma cells, or to rabbit mammary gland membranes prolactin receptor (PRLR), revealed only small or no reduction in binding capacity. The complex formation between these analogues and receptor extracellular domains (R-ECD) of various hormones was determined by gel filtration. Wild type bPL yielded 1:2 complex with hGHR-ECD, rat PRLR-ECD, and rbPRLR-ECD, whereas both analogues formed only 1:1 complexes with all R-ECDs tested. Real time kinetics experiments demonstrated that the ability of the analogues to form homodimeric complexes was compromised in both PRLR- and GHR-ECDs. The biological activity transduced through lactogenic receptors in <i>in vitro</i> bioassays in rabbit mammary gland acini culture and in Nb2 cells was almost fully retained, whereas the activity transduced through somatogenic receptors in FDC-P1 cells transfected with rbGHRs or with hGHRs was abolished. Both analogues exhibited antagonistic activity in the latter cells. To explain the discrepancy between the effect of the mutation on the signal transduced by PLR <i>versus</i> GHRs we suggest that: 1) the mutation impairs the ability of site 2 of bPL to form a stable homodimeric complex with <i>both</i> lactogenic and somatogenic receptors by a drastic shortening of the half-life of 2:1 complex; 2) the transient existence of the homodimeric complex is still sufficient to initiate the signal transduced through lactogenic receptors but not through somatogenic receptors; and 3) one possible reason for this difference is that JAK2, which serves as a mediator of both receptors, is already associated with lactogenic receptors prior to hormone binding-induced receptor dimerization, whereas in somatogenic receptors the JAK2 receptor association occurs subsequently to receptor dimerization."

Furthermore, the iron complex of the drug (Fe-BLM), Fig. 1 B) is remarkably selective in both the sequences that are cleaved, with a preference for 5′-GyPy-3′ sequences (9D′Andrea A.D. Haseltine W.A.

Several features of Fe-BLM have been identified that may explain the ability to activate oxygen, such as the presence of a delocalized π-electron buffer around iron and the strong iron-pyrimidine π-backbonding (13Takahashi S.

In contrast, the structural features of Fe-BLM responsible for the sequence and chemical specificity of the DNA degradation reaction remain largely obscure. Indeed, there have been reports implicating almost every region of the Fe-BLM molecule, including the C-terminal bithiazole and dimethylsulfonium groups (15Chien M. Grollman A.P. Horwitz S.B.

While many of these reports appear to provide conflicting results, the one requirement from all but one (24Guajardo R.J. Hudson S.E. Brown S.J. Mascharak P.K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7971-7977Crossref Scopus (169) Google Scholar) of these studies is that for sequence-specific cleavage of DNA to occur, both the metal binding site and bithiazole moiety must be intact. In this paper, we report changes in the metal binding site of Fe-BLM induced by complexation with DNA, using optical, EPR, and resonance Raman spectroscopy. Previously, we utilized resonance Raman spectroscopy to obtain structural information regarding the local environment of the metal site of Fe-BLM (13Takahashi S. Sam J.W. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4408-4413Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have now extended our studies to Fe-BLM bound to the self-complementary hexanucleotides, d(CGCGCG) and d(ATATAT), with the intent of detecting structural changes in the metal binding site that correlate with the sequence specificity of DNA cleavage. The use of hexameric DNA sequences is based on reports that Fe-BLM-mediated cleavage of d(CGCGCG) has been well characterized and shown to occur overwhelmingly at the third deoxycytosine residue from the 5′-end (dC-5) (25Rabow L.E. Kozarich J.W. Gerlt J.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7130-7131Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Rabow L.E. McGall G.H. Stubbe J. Kozarich J.W. J. Am. Chem.

Although cleavage of AT sites by Fe-BLM has also been documented, scission at these sites occurs with much lower efficiency (9D′Andrea A.D. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 10Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Ohtsubo E. Ohtsubo H. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5983-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We also investigated the effect of phosphate on Fe(III)-BLM bound to DNA, since it has been shown that phosphate increases the efficiency of DNA cleavage by Fe-BLM and that phosphate converts Fe(III)-BLM from a low to a high spin complex, an effect that can be negated by the addition of DNA (28Burger R.M. Horwitz S.B. Peisach J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3623-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The spectroscopic methods employed in this study suggest small changes in the environment of the iron atom (Fig. 1 B) when Fe-BLM binds to d(CGCGCG) but not to d(ATATAT). It is concluded, then, that binding to d(CGCGCG) alters the conformations of the iron ligands without changing their composition. Such alterations in ligand conformation are not seen with d(ATATAT). Thus, the results presented in this paper are the first experimental evidence of DNA sequence-specific alterations in the metal binding site of Fe(III)-BLM and further lends credence to the view that the metal binding site is responsible for sequence recognition related to specificity of cleavage. Bleomycin A2 was purified from bleomycin sulfate (Blenoxane; generously supplied by Bristol-Myers Co., Syracuse, NY) over a Source S fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (29Sam J.W. Tang X.-J. Magliozzo R.S. Peisach J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 1012-1018Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The purity of the BLM fractions was confirmed by mass spectrometry (30Sam J.W. Tang X.-J. Peisach J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5250-5256Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The ferric complex of the drug was prepared by the addition of Fe(III)NH4(SO4)2 to 1.1 equivalents of BLM followed by at least 10 equivalents of buffer to bring the pH to 7.5. Fe(II)-BLM was formed by the anaerobic addition of excess (2–5 equivalents) Na2S2O4 to a septum-stoppered Raman cell containing Fe(III)-BLM. The CO complex was produced from Fe(II)-BLM by anaerobically flushing the Raman cell with CO for several minutes. Isotopically labeled chemicals were obtained from Aldrich (D2O, 99.9%) and ICON (Mt. Marion, NY; H218O, 97%, and13C18O, 99%). Final isotope enrichments for BLM solutions in D2O or H218O were at least 90%. Calf thymus DNA (Boehringer Mannheim) was purified by ethanol precipitation and centrifugal dialysis (Centricon-3, Amicon) and sheared by sonication and pipetting. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized at the DNA synthesis facility of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and purified by ethanol precipitation, reverse phase HPLC (C18-Bondapak, Waters), and centrifugal dialysis (Centricon-3, Amicon). Final Fe-BLM concentrations employed in the resonance Raman and EPR experiments were about 2 mm. DNA-drug complexes were formed by the addition of preformed Fe(III)-BLM to 1.1 equivalents of DNA. Throughout this paper, the concentration of DNA is given in units of molarity of the double-stranded oligomer. UV and visible spectra were acquired using a modified Cary 14DS spectrophotometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). The integrity of the samples used for the Raman spectra was verified by optical spectra (350–500 nm) taken before and after each Raman measurement using a DW2000 spectrophotometer (SLM-Aminco, Urbana, IL). EPR spectroscopy was conducted at 77 K on an X-band Varian E-112 spectrometer equipped with a Systron-Donner frequency counter, a Varian NMR gaussmeter, and a rectangular TE101 cavity. Peak widths at gmax were measured at half-peak height with ±1 G accuracy. A krypton ion laser (Spectra Physics, Mountain View, CA) was employed to excite samples contained in quartz cells that were rotated at 1000 rpm at room temperature. Rayleigh scattered light was removed by a holographic filter (Kaiser, Ann Arbor, MI). Raman scattered light was dispersed by a single polychromator (SPEX, Metuchen, NJ) equipped with a 1200 groove/mm grating and detected by a cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Princeton, NJ). The spectral line width was approximately 5 cm−1. Typically, eight consecutive measurements of 1-min duration, using 10 milliwatt of laser power at 406.7 nm, were taken and added to yield a Raman spectrum. Cosmic ray-induced spikes were removed before averaging by a computer software routine. Raman shifts were calibrated using neat indene and/or laser fluorescence emission lines as frequency standards, providing absolute accuracy of ±2 cm−1. Fig. 2 displays the optical spectrum from 290 to 525 nm of Fe(III)-BLM as it is titrated with calf thymus DNA; the bands at 365 and 384 nm seen for Fe(III)-BLM (Fig. 2,inset, trace D) have not been assigned but may result from charge transfer transitions between the iron atom and its various ligands, since charge transfer bands have been located in this region for Fe(II)-BLM (14Loeb K.E. Zaleski J.M. Westre T.E. Guajardo R.J. Mascharak P.K. Hedman B. Hodgson K.O. Solomon E.I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 4545-4561Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). When Fe(III)-BLM (Fig. 2,inset, trace D) binds to ct-DNA, there is a slight increase in the intensity of these bands (trace A) as well as a red shift to 370 and 387 nm, respectively. This latter effect of DNA binding may be due to broadening of the large underlying peak at 291 nm, which has been ascribed to the bithiazole π-π* and pyrimidine n-π* transitions (31Takita T. Muraoka Y. Nakatani T. Fujii A. Iitaka Y. Umezawa H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 1978; 31: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar,32Dabrowiak J.C. Greenaway F.T. Santillo F.S. Crooke S.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These changes are also observed when Fe(III)-BLM binds to either d(CGCGCG) (trace B) or d(ATATAT) (trace C). Note that the concentrations of the drug (150 μm) and oligomers (250 μm) are much lower than those used in the Raman experiments, and further, that increases (to ∼300 μm) in the concentration of either oligomer had no effect on the optical spectra (not shown). Albertini and Garnier-Suillerot (21Albertini J.P. Garnier-Suillerot A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have reported that when Fe(III)-BLM binds to ct-DNA, the only change is an increase in the rhombicity of its EPR spectrum, manifested as a shift in gmax from 2.40 to 2.43. This is a peculiar result, since the value of gmax for Fe(III)-BLM has previously been measured as 2.43 by Sugiura (33Sugiura Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 5208-5215Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and 2.45 by Burger et al.(34Burger R.M. Peisach J. Horwitz S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11636-11644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Traces A and B of Fig. 3 display the X-band EPR spectrum of free, low spin Fe(III)-BLM in Tris buffer. The value of gmax for this species is 2.43, in good agreement with the results of Sugiura (33Sugiura Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1980; 102: 5208-5215Crossref Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when Fe(III)-BLM binds to d(CGCGCG) or ct-DNA, there is no shift in any of the features in the derivative EPR spectrum (Fig. 3, traces D andE); however, there is a sizable decrease in the width (at half-peak height) of the g = 2.43 feature. Less narrowing is seen at other features of the spectrum (a reduction of gmid from 24 to 22 gauss in peak-to-trough width with DNA and a reduction in width at half-peak height for gmin from 41 to 31 gauss with DNA). That one obtains a nearly identical EPR spectrum, but with narrowing of the spectral features, suggests that the change in the metal site induced by binding DNA is small. In addition, the structure of the metal binding site of the d(CGCGCG)-bound form of the drug is more homogeneous; i.e. the iron drug complex without DNA can assume multiple conformers in frozen solution as judged from the asymmetry of the g = 2.43 feature. 2The second derivative of the EPR absorption at the g = 2.43 feature clearly shows more than one component, confirming the multiplicity of conformers of the drug. In the presence of d(CGCGCG) or ct-DNA, only a single conformer is recognized by this method at the same g value. The apparent narrowing is then a consequence of the reduction of the number of conformers upon binding to d(CGCGCG) or DNA. The EPR spectrum of Fe(III)-BLM bound to ct-DNA (Fig. 3, trace E) is essentially the same as that of the d(CGCGCG)-bound form (Fig. 3,trace D). This is consistent with the early observation that Fe-BLM preferentially cleaves CG sequences. In contrast, the spectrum of the d(ATATAT)-bound form of the drug displays no shifts and minimal narrowing of the g = 2.43 feature (Fig. 3, trace C). These data demonstrate that there are structural differences in the iron site of the drug depending on the sequence of the bound oligonucleotide. Fig. 4,trace A, displays the nonresonance Raman spectrum of metal-free BLM. The spectrum has a strong line at 1540 cm−1, which has been assigned to the bithiazole moiety (35Freedman T.B. Santillo F.S. Zimba C.G. Nafie L.A. Dabrowiak J.C. J. Raman Spectrosc. 1983; 14: 266-270Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). This line at the same frequency is present in the Raman spectrum of Fe(III)-BLM (Fig. 4, trace B) but at a slightly lower frequency in the spectrum of d(CGCGCG)-bound Fe(III)-BLM (Fig. 4, trace C). This shift is reproducible and shows that the conformation of the bithiazole group changes slightly upon DNA binding. Fig. 4, trace D, displays the nonresonance Raman spectrum of d(CGCGCG), which is essentially identical to previously published spectra and demonstrates that the oligomer adopts a B-helix conformation (36Thomas G.A. Peticolas W.L. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3202-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since the resonance Raman lines from the iron complexes of BLM are weak and overlapped by the nonresonant lines from metal-free BLM and from the oligomer, all subsequent Raman spectra are difference spectra obtained by subtracting the nonresonant components. Fig. 5, trace A, shows the 1200–1700 cm−1 region of the Raman spectrum of Fe(III)-BLM after subtracting the metal-free components of the spectrum, so as to minimize the bithiazole peak near 1540 cm−1. Likewise, trace A′ in Fig. 5was obtained by subtracting the spectra of metal-free BLM (Fig. 4,trace A) and d(CGCGCG) (Fig. 4, trace D) from the resonance Raman spectrum of Fe(III)-BLM bound to d(CGCGCG) (Fig. 4, trace C) so as to minimize the difference pattern between 1510 and 1590 cm−1; this difference pattern is caused by a small shift of the bithiazole line to a lower frequency induced by the binding of d(CGCGCG). Similar difference spectra obtained between the free and the d(CGCGCG)-bound drug in either H218O (traces B and B′, respectively) and D2O (traces C and C′, respectively) are also presented in Fig. 5. The spectrum of DNA-free Fe(III)-BLM in H2O (Fig. 5,trace A) contains resonance-enhanced lines at 1611 and 1478 cm−1, assigned as the amide I and II modes of the β-hydroxyhistidyl amide (Fig. 1 B), as well as lines at 1390 and 1372 cm−1, proposed as internal modes of the pyrimidine ring (13Takahashi S.

The frequencies and proposed assignments of the various resonance-enhanced Raman lines referred to in this paper have been compiled in Table I. When the drug is bound to d(CGCGCG), the amide modes are narrowed and shifted significantly, and new peaks appear at 1405, 1367, and 1352 cm−1 (Fig. 5, trace A′); these new lines are resonance-enhanced and are not present in the spectrum of d(CGCGCG) alone (Fig. 4, trace D). The narrowing of the β-hydroxyhistidyl amide modes indicates an increase in the homogeneity of these motions and is consistent with the metal binding site adopting a more rigid, unique structure when the drug is bound to d(CGCGCG), as inferred from the above EPR spectra (Fig. 3).Table IFrequencies, line widths (full width at half height), and proposed assignments for the resonance raman lines for DNA-free, d(CGCGCG)-bound, and d(ATATAT)-bound Fe(III)-BLMProposed assignmentDNA-free Fe(III)-BLM (in H2O/H218O/D2O)d(CGCGCG)-bound Fe(III)-BLM (in H2O/H218O/D2O)d(ATATAT)-bound Fe(III)-BLM in H2OFrequenciesWidthaAverage of the three readings obtained for H2O, H218O, and D2O solutions.FrequenciesWidthaAverage of the three readings obtained for H2O, H218O, and D2O solutions.FrequenciesWidthcm−1cm−1cm−1cm−1cm−1cm−1Amide I (C = O stretch) of the β-hydroxyhistidyl amide1611/1611/1612221614/1614/1616171613NAbNA, not assessed due to spectral overlap or noise.Amide II (C–N stretch) of the β-hydroxyhistidyl amide1478/1478/1480221475/1475/147515148223Pyrimidine ring mode1390/1390/1391NA1390/1390/1390NA1389NAPyrimidine ring mode1372/1372/1375NA1367/1367/1374NA1372NAPyrimidine ring modeNOcNO, not observed.NO1405/1405/NONANONOPyrimidine ring modeNONO1352/1354/1358NANONOFe(III)-OH stretch561/541/55634558/540/5472056034a Average of the three readings obtained for H2O, H218O, and D2O solutions.b NA, not assessed due to spectral overlap or noise.c NO, not observed. Open table in a new tab With D2O as the solvent, the Raman lines between 1250 and 1450 cm−1 show complex deuterium shifts (Fig. 5,traces C and C′), while the data for the samples in H218O (Fig. 5, traces B and B′) are identical with that for samples in H2O (Fig. 5, traces A andA′). At present, the lines in the D2O spectra cannot be correlated definitively with those in the H2O spectra. However, since there is a weak shoulder at 1405 cm−1 in the spectra of the DNA-free form of the drug (Fig. 5, traces A and B), one can speculate that the “new” line at 1405 cm−1 in the spectra of the d(CGCGCG)-bound Fe(III)-BLM (Fig. 5, traces A′and B′) represents the same vibrational mode but is observed with greater intensity when the drug is bound to d(CGCGCG). Interestingly, this line is absent from the D2O spectra (Fig. 5, traces C and C′), presumably due to a large deuterium shift to an obscured position in the spectrum. Similarly, the doublet appearing at 1367 and 1352 cm−1 in the spectra of Fe(III)-BLM bound to d(CGCGCG) (Fig. 5,traces A′ and B′) might be interpreted as arising from the broad line at 1372 cm−1 in the spectra of the DNA-free form (Fig. 5, traces A andB), which is shifted and split by the binding of d(CGCGCG). We have previously (13Takahashi S. Sam J.W. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4408-4413Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) assigned the line at 1372 cm−1 as a pyrimidine ring mode; thus, we propose that the spectral features between 1350 and 1420 cm−1 represent internal modes of the pyrimidine ring, which displays a different splitting pattern when the drug interacts with the d(CGCGCG) oligomer. Fig. 6contains the 480–820 cm−1 region of the Raman spectra of DNA-free and d(CGCGCG)-bound Fe(III)-BLM. The lines at 784 and 682 cm−1 for samples in H2O (Fig. 6,trace A′) and H218O (Fig. 6, trace B′) are due to nonresonant DNA modes. The deuterium shifts of these modes are identical to those for the drug-free d(CGCGCG) solution (data no shown). The peak at 561 cm−1 in trace A has been assigned (13Takahashi S. Sam J.W. Peisach J. Rousseau D.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 4408-4413Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) as the Fe-OH stretching mode of free Fe(III)-BLM and shifts to 556 and 541 cm−1 in D2O and H218O, respectively (Fig. 6, traces B and C). When the drug binds d(CGCGCG), the line at 561 cm−1 is significantly narrowed and shifts to 558 cm−1 (Fig. 6, trace A′). Also, line narrowing is observed when the drug binds d(CGCGCG) in H218O or D2O. Interestingly, when D2O is employed as the solvent, this mode displays a much larger (9 cm−1) low frequency shift upon binding d(CGCGCG). Last, it should be noted that the assignments of all of the observed resonance Raman lines are the same for both DNA-free and d(CGCGCG)-bound Fe(III)-BLM and are consistent with the presence of the β-hydroxyhistidyl amide, pyrimidine, and hydroxide moieties as ligands to the iron atom. These results together with the optical absorption and EPR data strongly suggest that although there are conformational changes in the metal binding site when Fe(III)-BLM binds d(CGCGCG), the identities of the iron ligand remain the same. As mentioned above, d(CGCGCG) and d(ATATAT) have an identical effect on the optical spectrum of Fe(III)-BLM in the absence of phosphate, but the EPR spectrum of low spin Fe(III)-BLM is altered only when the drug binds the d(CGCGCG) oligomer. The resonance Raman spectra of Fe(III)-BLM bound to d(ATATAT) are presented in Fig. 7. Trace C has been corrected by subtracting the nonresonance Raman spectrum of d(ATATAT) (Fig. 7, trace A) from the spectrum obtained when the drug is bound to this oligomer (Fig. 7,trace B). It should be noted that the nonresonant bithiazole mode at 1538 cm−1 is not shifted when the drug is bound to d(ATATAT) (Fig. 7, traces C andD). Indeed, the DNA-free (Fig. 7, trace D) and d(ATATAT)-bound (Fig. 7, trace C) spectra are nearly identical. Although these data might lead one to conclude that Fe(III)-BLM does not form a complex with d(ATATAT), we contend that Fe(III)-BLM does in fact bind d(ATATAT). For example, there are identical changes in the optical spectrum of the drug in the presence of ct-DNA, d(CGCGCG), or d(ATATAT) (Fig. 2); further evidence for the binding of Fe(III)-BLM to d(ATATAT) is provided under “Discussion.” Therefore, the observation of changes in the resonance Raman and continuous wave EPR spectra of Fe(III)-BLM induced by the addition of d(CGCGCG) but not by the addition of d(ATATAT) provides the first direct evidence for sequence-specific alterations in the structure of the metal-binding site of Fe-BLM. We have obtained the resonance Raman spectra of Fe(II)-BLM and CO-Fe(II)-BLM bound to d(CGCGCG) and d(ATATAT) (data not shown). The spectra in the presence of DNA are essentially identical with those of the DNA-free form. Of particular interest is that the modes of the iron-bound CO of CO-Fe(II)-BLM are unchanged (±1 cm−1) when the drug is bound to d(CGCGCG) or d(ATATAT). Fe(III)-BLM in neutral phosphate solution forms a high spin complex (28Burger R.M. Horwitz S.B. Peisach J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3623-3629Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fig. 8, trace C, displays the optical spectrum of free Fe(III)-BLM in phosphate buffer; the absence of the two bands at 365 and 384 nm seen in Tris buffer (Fig. 2) is apparent. Not surprisingly, the Raman spectrum of this species shows no resonance-enhanced lines (not shown). However, upon adding d(CGCGCG), the optical bands reappear in the spectrum (Fig. 8,trace A), and the resulting Raman spectrum is identical to that of the d(CGCGCG)-bound form in Tris buffer. Furthermore, the Raman spectra of the d(CGCGCG)-bound forms of Fe(II)-BLM and CO-Fe(II)-BLM in phosphate buffer are identical to the same species in Tris buffer. However, upon adding d(ATATAT) to a solution of phosphate-buffered Fe(III)-BLM, one does not see a reappearance of the 365 and 384 nm bands (Fig. 8, trace B). The simplest explanation of these data is that phosphate binds to free Fe(III)-BLM, causing the changes in its optical spectrum and spin state, and d(CGCGCG) is capable of displacing the phosphate, whereas d(ATATAT) is not. It should be stressed, however, that there is no direct evidence that phosphate binds to the iron atom in Fe(III)-BLM. We have confirmed that Fe(III)-BLM forms complexes with d(CGCGCG) and d(ATATAT) by demonstrating an increase in the intensity of the absorption bands at 365 and 384 nm of the drug when bound to either of the oligonucleotides. The binding of Fe-BLM to these oligomers was not surprising, since several reports have demonstrated binding of the drug to both CG and AT sequences (3Petering D.H. Byrnes R.W. Antholine W.E. Chem.

For this purpose, three mutant γ subunits were produced: γΔ194–230, here 37 amino acids from Pro-194 to Ile-230 are deleted, γC199A, Cys-199 is changed to Ala, and γΔ200–204, amino acids from Asp-200 to Lys-204 are deleted. All of the chimeric subunit complexes produced from each of these mutant CF1-γ subunits and α and β subunits from thermophilic bacterial F1 lost the sensitivity against thiol reagents when compared with the complex containing wild-type CF1-γ. The pH optimum (pH 8.5–9.0) and the concentration of methanol to stimulate ATPase activities were not affected by these mutations. These indicate that the introduction of the mutations did not change the main features of ATPase activity of the chimeric complex.However, the interaction between γ subunit and ε subunit was strongly influenced by the type of γ subunit itself. Although the ATPase activity of the chimeric complex that contained γΔ200–204 or γC199A was inhibited by the addition of recombinant ε subunit from CF1 similarly to complexes containing the reduced wild-type γ subunit, the recombinant ε subunit did not inhibit the ATPase of the complex, which contained the oxidized form of γ subunit. Therefore the affinity of the ε subunit to the γ subunit may be dependent on the state of the γ subunit or the ε subunit may bind to the oxidized form of γ subunit in a mode that does not inhibit the activity. The ATPase activity of the complex that contains γΔ194–230 was not efficiently inhibited by ε subunit. These results show that the formation or reduction of the disulfide bond on the γ subunit may induce a conformational change in the region that directly affects the interaction of this subunit with the adjacent ε subunit.

The enzymes consist of the membrane-embedded sector F0responsible for proton translocation, and the extrinsic catalytic part F1. The architecture of F1 is very similar in various kinds of cells or organelles. The F1 part is composed of five different subunits designated as α, β, γ, δ, and ε, and their molecular stoichiometry is 3:3:1:1:1. Nucleotide binding sites reside on each of the α and β subunits, i.e. there are altogether 6 nucleotide binding sites per F1. The catalytic sites are located at the interfaces between α and β subunits. The high resolution x-ray structure of bovine heart mitochondrial F1 confirmed that most of the amino acid residues that form this site are provided from the β subunit (4Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits, which have a similar three-dimensional structure, alternate in a hexagonal arrangement around a central cavity containing the γ subunit as already expected from previous electron microscopic studies (5Gogol E.P. Aggler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).

(10Sabbert D. Engelbrecht S. Junge W. Nature. 1996; 381: 623-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Recently, Noji et al. (11Noji H. Yasuda R. Kinoshita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Nature. 1997; 388: 299-302Crossref Scopus (1922) Google Scholar) directly observed that this γ subunit rotates in the central cavity formed by α and β subunits like a motor axis during the ATP hydrolysis reaction. This experiment clearly shows that the interaction between the part of coiled-coil of the γ subunit and the inner surface of the central cavity formed by α and β subunits is not tight, and the interaction between the γ subunit and one of α or β subunit can alternate step by step in one direction according to the catalytic reaction occurring sequentially at each of three catalytic sites. The CF0CF1-ATP synthase of chloroplasts is regulated by the proton gradient, which activates the enzyme and by the reduction or the oxidation of a disulfide bridge in the γ subunit, which modulates activity. The latter regulation is known as thiol modulation (12Nalin C.M. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7275-7280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structural basis for the thiol modulation is assigned to the sequence motif of 9 amino acids comprising two cysteines in the γ subunit (13Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In vitro reduction can be achieved by dithiothreitol (DTT) or other dithiols, but the natural reductant is a reduced thioredoxin f (14Schwarz O. Schürmann P. Strotmann H. J. Biol.

By these substitutions, CF1 became a DTT-insensitive enzyme. On the other hand, Gabrys et al. (16Gabrys H. Kramer D.M. Crofts A.R. Ort D.R. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) selected a couple of mutants with chloroplast ATPase redox responses that were different from that of the wild-type plant by screening the Arabidopsis grown from the seeds that were previously treated with mutagen. They selected some mutant plants that might contain mutations within the γ subunit of CF1. The ε subunit of CF1 is known as an intrinsic inhibitor protein. Recently, Cruz et al. (17Cruz J.A. Harfe B.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) produced recombinant mutant ε subunits and tested their effects on the ATPase activity of ε-deficient CF1 (CF1(−ε)). They determined that the most important part of the ε subunit as an inhibitor was the NH2-terminal region. Similar experiments were reported for the ε subunit of F1 from Escherichia coli(EF1) (19Jounouchi M. Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that about 15 amino acid residues from the NH2 terminus were necessary for the inhibition. Wilkens et al. (20Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported the three-dimensional structure of the isolated ε subunit from EF1 solved in solution by NMR spectroscopy. The structure shows that the NH2-terminal 90 amino acids form so-called β-sandwich structure with two five-stranded β sheets. The C-terminal domain, on the other hand, is formed by two α-helices. Recently, Uhlin et al. (21Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 15: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (154) Google Scholar) solved the crystal structure of this subunit at 2.3 Å resolution. They confirmed the β-sandwich structure reported by Wilkens et al. (20Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and found that the C-terminal two helices arranged in an anti-parallel coiled-coil structure. From the three-dimensional structure and cross-linking experiments employing cysteine mutants of γ and ε subunits, it was concluded that the contact region of ε subunit to γ subunit is at one side of the β-sandwich structure (20Wilkens S.

Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) also reported that the ε subunit of CF1 can contact the γ subunit at the similar region. The characteristics of the interaction between γ subunit and ε subunit of CF1 were investigated directly (24Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 25Duhe R.J. Selman B.R. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Andralojc and Harris (24Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) reported that the affinity of the ε subunit to CF1(−ε) was decreased when the γ subunit of the complex was in a reduced state. From the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity, they estimated aK d of 60 nm for the reduced CF1(−ε) and 0.14 nm for the oxidized one. Duhe and Selman (25Duhe R.J. Selman B.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) also reported a stimulation of dissociation of the ε subunit from CF1 of Chlamydomonas in the presence of DTT. They suggested that the dissociation of the ε subunit is an obligatory process in the DTT-induced unmasking of ATPase activity of soluble CF1. Soteropoulos et al.(26Soteropoulos P. Suss K.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported an activation of CF1-ATPase by dilution of the enzyme. For the reduced CF1, a half-maximal activation was obtained at a much lower dilution than with oxidized CF1, and they estimated that the affinity for the ε subunit would be decreased about 20-fold by the reduction of CF1. Recently, we reported on the reconstitution of a chimeric complex from recombinant α and β subunits from F1 of the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 (TF1) and the recombinant γ subunit (γc) from spinach CF1(27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The complex had substantial ATPase activity and this activity was affected by the disulfide/dithiol state of the two regulatory cysteine residues on the γ subunits. That means that γc imposed redox control on the chimeric complex. Furthermore, the activity of the chimeric complex was suppressed by the addition of recombinant ε subunit from CF1 (εc), but not by the addition of the ε subunit from TF1. These results suggest that the regulatory functions of γ and ε subunits of CF1 may be linked to each other. Here, we prepared three modified γ subunits of CF1 by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. We investigated the effects of the mutations on the enzyme activity and its regulation in chimeric complexes formed by these γ subunits, εc, and α3β3 from TF1. We found the region around the disulfide bridge of the γ subunit to be important for the regulatory interaction between the γ subunit and ε subunit. Restriction endonucleases were obtained from Toyobo Inc., Tokyo, Japan. The Bradford protein assay system was from Bio-Rad. Urea was purchased from Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. DTT was from Sigma. Other chemicals were the highest grade commercially available. Recombinant plasmids carrying the gene for the γ subunit from spinach plastids (atpC) was previously constructed (27Hisabori T. Kato Y.

The one used to create the γc with Cys-199 changed to Ala (γC199A) was: 5′-ACCCTACTCCCCTTAAGACCCAAAGGAGAAATTGCGGACATCAATGGAAAA-3′. To create γc with the amino acid sequence from Asp-200 to Lys-204 deleted (γΔ200–204), the following oligonucleotide was used: 5′-ACCCTACTCCCCTTAAGACCCAAA-GGAGAAATTTGCTGTGTCGACGCAGCAGAA-3′. Each of the genes was transferred to the expression vector pET23d (Novagen) and was transformed into the expression host E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Each of the γc proteins was expressed yielding inclusion bodies and further purified by the methods described previously (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The plasmid pSocB149 (28Kunkel T.A. Bebenk K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), which contains the gene for the subunit ε of CF1 from spinach (εc) was a generous gift from Dr. Whitfeld, R. P., Australia. The expression plasmid for εc was constructed according to the method described by Hisabori et al. (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3). εc was over-expressed by the method used for γc. The εc inclusion bodies were first dissolved by the addition of 8 m urea, 40 mmTris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.4 mm DTT, and 0.8 mm EDTA and further purified by the method described previously (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The recombinant α and β subunits of TF1 were expressed inE. coli strain DK8 (bglR, thi-1, rel-1, HfrPO1, Δ(uncB-uncC)ilv::Tn10) and purified as described previously (30Ohta S. Yohda M. Ishizuka M.

Yohda M. Date T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 146: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the chimeric subunit complex was formed by the same method described previously (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, each of the isolated γc subunits was mixed with the α and β subunits from TF1 in a ratio of 1:1:1 (w/v), and a solution containing 8 m urea, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, and 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) was added to yield a final urea concentration of 4 m. The solution was then dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 0.4 mm MgCl2, and 0.4 mm ATP at 20 °C for 3 h. After the dialysis, the unsolved γc subunits were removed from the solution by centrifugation and provided for the measurement of ATPase activity. To activate or deactivate the α3β3γc complexes by the formation or reduction of disulfide bridge on the γ subunit, formed complexes were incubated in the presence of 2 mm DTT or 50 μm CuCl2 for 2 h at 30 °C. Then 10 μl of the complex solution (normally containing 2–3 μg of protein) was added to 90 μl of the reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.0), 2 mm ATP, and 2 mm MgCl2 to initiate the reaction. The reaction was continued for 5–10 min, and then terminated by the addition of 100 μl of ice-cold 2.4% (v/v) perchloric acid. The amounts of liberated Pi were measured by a colorimetric method. Since the ATPase activity was measured by the mixture of the chimeric complex and the monomer proteins, which were not incorporated into the complex, the specific activity of the ATPase was calculated based on the amounts of α plus β subunits that were used for the formation of the complex. In comparison to the γ subunit from thermophilic bacteria, the γ subunit of CF1contains a stretch of an additional 37 amino acids comprising the two cysteines (Cys-199 and Cys-205), which are responsible for the thiol modulation (Fig. 1 A). To characterize the differences of the properties between bacterial γ and chloroplast γ, we designed three mutations of the γ subunit of CF1. These were γΔ194–230, which is lacking the CF1-γ specific additional amino acid stretch (see Fig. 1 B), γΔ200–204, in which the space between the two regulatory cysteines is shortened, and γC199A, which cannot form the disulfide bridge involved in thiol modulation. The complexes containing those mutant γc subunits were not supposed to show any responses against oxidation/reduction. As shown in Fig. 2, the ATPase activity of these chimeric complexes was not altered by the incubation with DTT or with CuCl2, although the ATPase activity of the complex containing wild-type γc was remarkably stimulated by the incubation with DTT and suppressed by the incubation with CuCl2 as reported previously (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Figure 2Change of the ATPase activity of the chimeric α3β3γc complexes by incubation with DTT or CuCl2. The chimeric complex was reconstituted from 500 μg of γc, α subunit, and β subunit according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” Then each of the complexes was incubated with 2 mm DTT (▦) or 50 μmCuCl2 (▪) for 2 h at 30 °C, and their ATPase activities were measured. The ATPase activity (μmol Pireleased/mg α + β/min) of each of the complexes that were not treated with DTT or CuCl2 (□) was 0.672 with wild-type γ, 0.254 with γΔ194–230, 0.557 with γΔ200–204, and 0.534 with γC199A, and set as 100%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) For further characterization of the mutant γ subunits, some properties of the chimeric complexes were investigated. First, we measured the pH dependence of the ATPase activity of the complexes. We could not find any change of pH dependence of ATPase activity; all four kinds of complexes showed the same pH profiles (data not shown), indicating that the property of the catalytic sites did not change by the mutation of γc subunit. Also the optimal pH (pH 8.5–9.0) was the same as that found for the authentic TF1(32Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 3348-3485Google Scholar) or CF1 (33Sakurai H. Shinohara K. Hisabori T. Shinohara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Methanol stimulation of ATPase activity is one of the unique features of isolated (33Sakurai H. Shinohara K. Hisabori T. Shinohara K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1981; 90: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 34Selman-Reimer S. Merchant S. Selman B.R. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 5476-5482Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and membrane-bound CF1(35Anthon G.E. Jagendorf A.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 723: 358-365Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In a previous report, we found that the incorporation of the γ subunit from CF1 into the bacterial α3β3 hexagon conferred the property of methanol stimulation of the ATPase to the complex, whereas the α3β3γ complex formed by the bacterial subunits only is insensitive against methanol (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the ATPase activities of all four chimeric complexes were stimulated by the addition of methanol and optimal concentrations of methanol were 25% (v/v). The most remarkable difference between the γ subunit from thermophilic bacteria and the γ subunit of CF1 is the occurrence of an intercalated amino acid stretch of more than 30 amino acids in CF1-γ (Fig. 1 A). One may expect that the region that senses methanol would be located in this additional stretch. However, when the mutant γ subunit, which is lacking in this region, was used to form the chimeric complex, the methanol sensitivity was the same as for the complex that contained the wild-type γ subunit. Therefore, the methanol sensitivity of CF1-γ subunit must be attributed to some other portion of the protein. The ε subunit of F1 is an intrinsic ATPase inhibitor. However, this subunit may also be involved in H+ coupling of the ATPase (36Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Cruz et al. (17Cruz J.A. Harfe B. Radkowski C.A. Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Cruz J.A. Radkowski C.A. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 1185-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) expressed the mutant ε subunit of CF1 in E. coli and investigated their inhibitory effects on the CF1(−ε). Similar deletion experiments were carried out for EF1 by Jounouchi et al. (19Jounouchi M. Takeyama M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). They reported that the deletion of the NH2-terminal 16 amino acids is strongly affecting the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and H+ translocation, but F1 with an ε subunit lacking the 15 amino-terminal residues could bind to F0 in a functionally competent manner. However, Cruz et al. (17Cruz J.A. Harfe B. Radkowski C.A. Dann M.S. McCarty R.E. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 1379-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) found that the deletions of 6 amino acids from the C terminus or the deletions of 11 amino acids from the NH2 terminus decreased the inhibitory effect of this subunit on the ATPase of CF1. The Mg2+-ATPase activity of the oxidized form of CF1 is quite low or almost zero. However, the chimeric complex displayed remarkable Mg2+-ATPase activity even in its oxidized form. Therefore it was possible to investigate the interaction between the ε and γ subunits under the reduced and oxidized conditions by measuring the inhibition of the ATPase. Surprisingly, the ATPase activity was less inhibited by the ε subunit in the chimeric complex with the oxidized γ subunit than with the reduced γ subunit (Fig. 4 A) (27Hisabori T. Kato Y. Motohashi K. Strotmann H. Kroth-Pancic P. Amano T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1158-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The addition of methanol reduced the inhibitory effect of εc for both the reduced and oxidized state complexes, indicating the stimulation effect of methanol on CF1-ATPase can be partially attributed to the release of the ε subunit from the enzyme. A change of the responses of CF1 against the ε subunit under the reduced or oxidized condition were already reported by Andralojc and Harris (24Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), Duhe and Selman (25Duhe R.J. Selman B.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and Soteropouloset al. (26Soteropoulos P. Suss K.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Andralojc and Harris (24Andralojc P.J. Harris D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1016: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) investigated the inhibition of Ca2+-ATPase activity. By adding the various amounts of isolated ε subunit to CF1(−ε), they concluded that the oxidized CF1(−ε) has a higher affinity for the isolated ε subunit than the reduced enzyme. Soteropoulos et al. (26Soteropoulos P. Suss K.H. McCarty R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10348-10354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) diluted CF1 solution to nanomolar concentration and found a difference of the activation ratio by oxidation/reduction. Activation by dilution occurred for the reduced enzyme at higher than for the reduced enzyme. From their results, they concluded that the affinity of the ε subunit to the reduced CF1 is about 20-fold lower than to the oxidized one. It is difficult to explain why the apparent affinity of the ε subunit to the chimeric complex is lower when the γ subunit is in the oxidized state. Possibly the origin of the α3β3 hexamer influences the interaction, too. On the other hand, we cannot be sure that the γcreally has the same conformation in the chimeric complex as the authentic CF1. If the additional amino acid stretch observed only on CF1 is responsible for the interaction between the γ and ε subunits, a mutation of this segment might affect the inhibition of ATPase by the ε subunit. The sensitivity of the complexes that contain γC199A or γΔ200–204 against the ε subunit was the same as that of the complex with the reduced form of the γ subunit (Fig. 4 B), although we expected that the conformation of γΔ200–204 was similar to the oxidized-form of the γ subunit. On the other hand, the complex that contains γΔ194–230was not inhibited by the addition of the ε subunit. From the report of Capaldi and co-workers (20Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 22Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the contact region between the ε and γ subunits is located around 40 amino acids from the NH2 terminus of the ε subunit. The chemical cross-linking experiments carried out by using cross-linker-labeled ε subunit and CF1(−ε) gave the same conclusion (23Schulenberg B. Wellmer F. Lill H. Junge W. Engelbrecht S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 249: 134-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The contact region on the γ subunit is very close to the position where the additional amino acid stretch is intercalated in CF1-γ (13Miki J. Maeda M. Mukohata Y. Futai M. FEBS Lett. 1988; 232: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 A). Hence, the structure of this additional amino acid stretch might be very important not only for the redox regulation but also for the interaction between the γ and ε subunits. Ross et al. (37Ross S.A. Zhang M.X. Selman B.R. J. Bioenegr. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) reported that mutation of the spacer region between the two regulatory cysteines (GEICD(K or A)VDGK(D)CVDAA) diminished redox regulation of CF1 from Chlamydomonas. They used C. reinhardtii strain atpC1, which lacks the gene for the γ subunit, and complemented the photophosphorylation activity with mutated γ subunit genes. Thylakoid vesicles prepared from the mutant strain containing γD199K/K203D or γD199A did not show a remarkable change of the photophosphorylation in the presence or the absence of DTT. Accordingly the authors concluded that the spacer region between the disulfide bridge is also involved in redox regulation of CF1. This result corresponds with our result concerning γΔ200–204. Although γΔ200–204 still contains the two cysteines, the complex with this subunit did not show any difference in activity by incubation with DTT or CuCl2, respectively (Fig. 2). Apart from this all other properties of ATPase of this complex were the same as those of the wild type. This complex appeared to have an affinity for ε subunit because the ATPase of this complex was strongly inhibited by the addition of εc subunit (Fig. 4 B). Hence, our results strongly suggest that the change in the conformation that occurred at the lower part of the γ subunit is drastic enough to affect the binding of the ε subunit to this subunit, although the point that is different from the results of Ross et al. (37Ross S.A. Zhang M.X. Selman B.R. J. Bioenegr. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) as mentioned above should be further investigated. We thank Prof. R. G.

They are, however, functionally unrelated, despite the fact that the three-dimensional structure of these EGF-like domains, also, is often very similar to that of the EGF receptor agonists. In the present study, we linked an EGF-like repeat from the DrosophilaNotch protein to the N- and C-terminal linear tail sequences of human EGF (hEGF), and we showed that this chimera (E1N6E) is unable to bind or activate the hEGF receptor. This recombinant protein was then used as a basic construct for identifying the minimal requirements for high affinity EGF receptor binding and activation. We selectively reintroduced a limited number of important hEGF-derived residues, and by using this unique approach, we were able to make hEGF/Notch chimeras that, compared with wild type hEGF, showed nearly 100% binding affinity and mitogenic activity on HER-14 cells expressing the hEGF receptor.

Polypeptide growth factors acting through their tyrosine kinase receptors play a central role in the outgrowth of tumors. Many tumor cells are able to secrete such growth factors, to which they can respond in an autocrine fashion. High expression of members of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; hEGF, human EGF; mEGF, murine EGF; TGFα, transforming growth factor α; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP, reversed-phase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NCS, newborn calf serum; BES,N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. family, in particular of transforming growth factor α (TGFα), has been found in a variety of human cancers including breast and prostate cancers; oral and head and neck cancers; tumors of the gastrointestinal tract; and colon, lung, liver, kidney, and ovarian cancers (1Arteaga C.L.

Oncogenes and Tumor Suppressor Genes in Human Malignancies. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston1993: 233-254Google Scholar). Because most of these tumors also express the EGF receptor, there is evidence that TGFα cause autocrine growth stimulation in these tumors. In order to interfere with such autocrine processes, it might be of great interest to develop an EGF receptor antagonist, an EGF-like protein with high receptor binding affinity that is, however, unable to activate the receptor. Although attempts to design such an antagonist have as yet been unsuccessful, much progress has been made in elucidating the requirements for interaction of EGF with its receptor. There is much evidence to date that several residues in the so-called C-loop and in the C-terminal linear tail of EGF and TGFα are directly involved in high affinity binding to the EGF receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have indicated that Arg41 and Leu47, especially in hEGF, are highly conserved among the EGF receptor agonists and are irreplaceable (reviewed in Ref. 5Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is evidence that the C-terminal tail of TGFα, which is flexible in solution, becomes immobilized upon binding of TGFα to the hEGF receptor (6McInnes C. Hoyt D.W. Harkins R.N.

Two-dimensional NMR studies have shown that Arg41 and Gln43 are in close contact with Tyr13, Leu15, and His16, which indicates the possible existence of a nonlinear binding domain comprising residues from both the C- and N-terminal domains (6McInnes C. Hoyt D.W. Harkins R.N. Pagila R.N. Debanne M.T. O'Connor-McCourt M. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32204-32211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Hommel U.

We have, in the past, constructed exchange mutants between hEGF and human TGFα and provided evidence that ARG45 also, in the C-terminal tail is part of the receptor binding pocket (8Kramer R.H. Lenferink A.E.G. van Bueren-Koornneef I. van der Meer A. van de Poll M.L.M. van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8708-8711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9van de Poll M.L.M.

Using the same set of hEGF/human TGFα chimeras we have recently found that the 13A9 antibody, which specifically blocks the binding of human TGFα but not of hEGF, interferes with receptor binding of the C-terminal tail of human TGFα. 2A. E. G. Lenferink, A. D. G. Roos, M. J. H. Van Vugt, M. L. M. Van de Poll, and E. J. J. Van Zoelen, submitted for publication. This again emphasizes the importance of this region in receptor recognition. The B-loop, at the opposite site of the molecule, is, however, much less conserved among EGF receptor agonists, and we have recently shown, using chimeras of hEGF and the Drosophila EGF receptor antagonist Argos, that several nonconservative substitutions can be made in the B-loop of hEGF without a significant effect on binding affinity (11Van de Poll M.L.M.

Interestingly, a wide variety of proteins, including those involved in blood coagulation, neural development and cell adhesion, contain so-called EGF-like domains that share the characteristic spacing of six cysteines and three glycines with members of the EGF family but are functionally unrelated (12Campbell I.D. Bork P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 385-392Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Although they have no apparent binding affinity for the EGF receptor, increasing evidence exists that the three-dimensional structure of these EGF-like repeats is very similar to that of genuine EGF (13Selander M.

Because a correct protein conformation is a prerequisite for high affinity receptor binding, this makes these EGF-like repeats interesting candidates for domain exchange studies. In the present study, several chimeras were made between hEGF and EGF repeat 13 from Notch. The Drosophila notch gene encodes a 300-kDa transmembrane receptor with a large extracellular domain containing 36 EGF-like repeats (18Wharton K.A. Johansen K.M. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1985; 43: 567-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), of which numbers 11 and 12, especially, are involved in binding of the ligands Delta and Serrate. Notch is widely expressed in the Drosophila embryo, and upon ligand binding, it controls cell fate in many tissues (for recent reviews, see Refs. 19Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar and 20Simpson P. Nature. 1995; 375: 736-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We selected EGF repeat 13 (amino acids 530–560) because of its relatively high sequence homology with hEGF and because it already contains several residues (e.g.Arg41) that have been convincingly shown to be required for high affinity receptor binding. Despite this, the synthetic Notch EGF repeat was unable to bind the hEGF receptor. By selective reintroduction of hEGF-derived amino acids in to the Notch sequence, we were able to determine the minimal structural requirements for hEGF receptor binding. Using this unique approach, a functionally unrelated inactive EGF-like sequence was turned into a bioactive hEGF receptor ligand by introduction of only a limited number of important EGF-derived residues. The synthetic gene for hEGF (British Biotechnology, Oxford, United Kingdom) was linked at the 5′-end to the sequence coding for the recognition sequence (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) of the proteolytic enzyme factor X (21Nagai K. Thøgersen C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 461-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The resultingBamHI-SalI fragment (FX/EGF) was then placed in frame 3′ of the sequence coding for the two synthetic IgG binding domains (the so-called Z domains) of the pEZZ18 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (9van de Poll M.L.M. Lenferink A.E.G. van Vugt M.J.H. Jacobs J.J.L. Janssen J.W.H. Joldersma M. van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22337-22343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the EGF-like repeat 13 of Notch (amino acids 530–560) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the pMtNMg plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. Artavanis-Tsakonas, Yale University, New Haven, CT; see Ref. 18Wharton K.A. Johansen K.M. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Cell. 1985; 43: 567-581Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), and the polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pT7Blue T vector (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI). Chimeras of hEGF and Notch EGF repeat 13 were made by exchanging domains bordered by the shared cysteine residues. To generate E1N6E, which stands for hEGF containing the entire sequence of the Notch EGF repeat 13 between the first and sixth cysteine residue, the Notch EGF repeat was cleaved at the first cysteine codon with BsmI and at the sixth cysteine codon with DraIII. This fragment was subsequently cloned into the BsmI-SalI site of pEZZ/FX/EGF together with a double-stranded oligonucleotide spanning the region between the DraIII and the SalI sites. The pEZZ/FX/EGF and pEZZ/FX/E1N6E constructs were subsequently used to generate other hEGF/Notch chimeras. Exchanges at the first cysteine codon were achieved by digestion of hEGF and E1N6E withBsmI, exchanges at the third cysteine codon by digestion of hEGF with NsiI, exchanges at the fourth cysteine codon by digestion of E1N6E with DraI, and exchanges at the sixth cysteine codon by digestion of hEGF with SacI 3′ of the sixth cysteine codon. Synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were used to span the region between two endonuclease restriction sites. By digestion with NsiI, the codon for the hEGF-derived methionine at position 21 (C-terminal of the third cysteine codon) was preserved, generating E3N6E/M and E3N4E/M. The M21H point mutation, as well as other, additional mutations, was introduced using the Altered SitesTM II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega Inc., Madison, WI). Wild type and mutant growth factors were expressed and secreted as ZZ/FX/growth factor fusion proteins into the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli KS474, a degP protease-deficient mutant (a generous gift from Drs. K. L. Strauch and J. Beckwith, Harvard University; see Ref. 22Strauch K.L. Johnson K. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2689-2696Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Bacteria were grown in 2YTE (per liter: 16 g of bactotryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 8 g of NaCl, 0.4% glucose) at 30 °C until anA 600 of 1.5 was reached, and the periplasmic proteins were isolated as described previously (23Nilsson B. Abrahmsen L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 144-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The fusion proteins were purified using IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the recovery was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on binding competition with biotin-labeled protein A (24Van Zoelen E.J.J. Kramer R.H. Van Reen M.M.M. Veerkamp J.H. Ross H.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6275-6280Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The recombinant growth factors were separated from the two IgG binding domains by digestion with Factor X coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose and further purified by an additional run on IgG-Sepharose. Dimeric forms and inactive forms with disulfide bridge mismatches were removed by reversed-phase HPLC on a Deltapak C18 column (Waters Associates, Milford, MA). Elution was carried out using a linear gradient of 0–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetate. The biological activity in the column fractions (1 ml) was tested on HER-14 cells in a binding competition assay with125I-labeled murine EGF (mEGF) (see below). Fractions containing low affinity B-loop mutants were identified by dot blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody (Ab-3) raised against recombinant wild type hEGF (Oncogene Science Inc., Cambridge, MA). Previous studies have shown that this antibody also recognizes hEGF mutants with altered B-loop sequences (11Van de Poll M.L.M. Van Vugt M.J.H. Lenferink A.E.G. van Zoelen E.J.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7425-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Probed proteins were detected by a goat anti-rabbit antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Boehringer Mannhein). The presence of fusion proteins in the periplasm was verified on a 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and the Western blots were probed with a rat anti-goat antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase to detect IgG binding domains. Enzyme activity was detected by incubation with tetramethylbenzidine/sodium dioctylsulfosuccinate/H2O2 in phosphate/citrate buffer (pH 5). The amount of ZZ/FX/growth factor fusion protein present in the unpurified periplasm or in samples purified by IgG-Sepharose was estimated by measuring the total amount of IgG binding activity. This was done in a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using protein A as a standard and biotin-labeled protein A (Sigma) as a competitor (19Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Matsuno K. Fortini M.E. Science. 1995; 268: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (1410) Google Scholar). The amount of growth factor obtained after the final purification by RP-HPLC was calculated from the peak area (absorption at 229 nm) using natural mEGF (Bioproducts for Science Inc., Indianapolis, IN) analyzed under the same conditions as the standard. mEGF was iodinated using Enzymobeads (Bio-Rad) to a specific activity of ∼500 Ci/mmol. HER-14 cells (NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the hEGF receptor, obtained from Dr. J. Schlessinger (New York University; see Ref. 9van de Poll M.L.M. Lenferink A.E.G. van Vugt M.J.H. Jacobs J.J.L.

The medium was removed, and serial dilutions of wild type or mutant growth factors were added in 100 μl of DMEM containing 15 mm HEPES (pH 7.7) and 10% NCS together with 1 ng/ml 125I-mEGF. After incubation for 2 h at room temperature, the cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin and once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then lysed by incubation with 250 μl/well 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, radioactivity present in the cell lysates was measured by γ counting. Experiments were performed in duplicate using natural mEGF as a standard and repeated at least twice. HER-14 cells were seeded in gelatinized 24-well dishes at a density of 6.0 × 104 cells/well in 1 ml of DMEM/NCS. After 24 h of incubation, the medium was replaced by 0.9 ml of DMEM/Ham's F-12 medium (1:1) supplemented with 30 nm Na2SeO3, 10 μg/ml human transferrin, and 0.5% bovine serum albumin. After an additional 48 h of incubation, serial dilutions of purified growth factor were added in 0.1 ml of DMEM containing 50 mm BES (pH 6.8). Eight hours later, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added in 0.1 ml of Ham's F-12 medium. Incorporation of the tracer into cellular DNA was determined 24 h after growth factor addition. For this, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently fixed with methanol at room temperature. After 15 min, the methanol was aspirated, and the cells were lysed in 1 ml of 0.2n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C as described (25Van Zoelen E.J.J. Van Oostwaard T.M.J. Van der Saag P.T. De Laat S.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 123: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. A set of five chimeras was made initially by exchanging domains bordered by the conserved cysteine residues present in both hEGF and Notch EGF-repeat 13. They were named according to the nomenclature used in previous studies (8Kramer R.H. Lenferink A.E.G. van Bueren-Koornneef I. van der Meer A. van de Poll M.L.M. van Zoelen E.J.J. J. Biol.

All mutants were expressed and secreted into the periplasmic space ofE. coli KS474 fused to two protein A-derived IgG binding domains. These chimeras were initially screened as fusion proteins in a binding competition assay with 125I-mEGF for their ability to interact with the hEGF receptor. Their affinity was compared with that of hEGF fusion protein expressed in a parallel culture.Table IBinding affinity of domain exchange mutants of hEGF and NotchAffinity⌈ A-loop ⌉ ⌈ B-loop ⌉ ⌈ C-loop ⌉1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50hEGFNSDSEC PLSHDGY C LHDGVC MYIEA..LDKYA C NC VVGYIGER C QYRDLKWWELRNotch.DIDE C QSNP...C LNDGT C HDKI....NGFKC S C ALGFTGARC QT....hEGF———————————————————— +++Notch C1———————————————–C6 NDaND, not determined.E1N6E—–C1———————————————–C6—- −E3N6E————————C3—————————-C6—- −E3N4E————————C3————C4——————– −E1N2E—–C1——–C2——————————————- ±E5N6E——————————————-C5———C6—- ++Chimeric growth factors were tested as fusion proteins with two protein A-derived IgG-binding domains, and their affinity for the hEGF receptor was compared with wild type hEGF fusion protein in a 125I-mEGF binding competition assay.

The chimeric growth factors are presented schematically. Domains are exchanged bordered by the six cysteine residues C1–C6, which are present in both hEGF and Notch. hEGF sequences are presented as dashed lines, and Notch sequences are double underlined. In the first chimera, E1N6E, the entire sequence of EGF-repeat 13 from Notch was inserted in hEGF between the first and sixth cysteine residues. E1N6E shows a high sequence homology with hEGF in the C-loop (Gly36, Phe37 (Tyr37 in hEGF), Gly39, and Arg41) and in the region between the second and third cysteine residues (Leu15, Asp17, and Gly18). Furthermore, both the N- and C-terminal tails of hEGF are present in E1N6E. Despite this, we were unable to detect any biological activity of E1N6E on HER-14 cells expressing the hEGF receptor (Table I). Instead, when only the C-loop of Notch was inserted in hEGF a chimeric protein (E5N6E) was obtained with nearly 100% binding affinity (Table I). This indicates that the Notch C-loop meets the requirements of high affinity binding, most likely because of its high sequence homology with hEGF. However, exchange of either the A-loop or the B-loop of hEGF with the corresponding sequence in Notch resulted in a chimera (E1N2E and E3N4E, respectively) with a significantly reduced binding affinity (Table I). This suggests that there are specific requirements for binding in both the A- and B-loops of hEGF that are absent in the Notch sequence. NMR studies have shown that residues located around the second cysteine, which are Tyr13, Leu15, and His16 in hEGF, are in close contact with residues in the C-loop, such as Arg41, forming a nonlinear binding pocket (6McInnes C. Hoyt D.W. Harkins R.N. Pagila R.N. Debanne M.T. O'Connor-McCourt M. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32204-32211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Hommel U. Harvey T.S. Driscoll P.C. Campbell I.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The latter residue, especially, has little freedom of mutation and is absolutely conserved among EGF receptor agonists (5Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). But also, the residues in the N-terminal domain are relatively well conserved (5Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), with a tyrosine or a phenylalanine at position 13; a leucine, an isoleucine, or a phenylalanine at position 15, and a histidine or an asparagine at position 16. This suggests that together with Arg41 and Leu47 in the C-terminal domain, these residues may form a nonlinear binding pocket. In EGF-repeat 13 of Notch, the third domain, located between the second and third cysteine residues, shows a very strong homology with the corresponding domain in hEGF. In contrast, the Notch A-loop sequence between the first and second cysteine shows no homology at all with any of the known EGF receptor agonists (see Table I). Most apparent are the difference in the length of the loop (4 amino acids in Notch as opposed to 7 in hEGF) and the absence of the tyrosine (or phenylalanine) just N-terminal of the second cysteine (corresponding to position 13 in hEGF). To determine the minimal requirements of the A-loop sequence for high affinity EGF receptor binding, we introduced a tyrosine residue in E1N2E just N-terminal of the second cysteine by mutating the proline residue in the Notch sequence. This mutant was designated E1N2E/Y (Table II). Both E1N2E and E1N2E/Y were expressed and purified to homogeneity (after protein A cleavage) by RP-HPLC as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their ability to interact with the hEGF receptor was measured in a125I-mEGF binding competition assay on HER-14 cells. Fig. 1 A shows that both mutants are able to displace radiolabeled mEGF. As expected, much higher concentrations of E1N2E than of wild type hEGF were needed to reach 50% competition, and the affinity of the chimera was calculated to be 9% of that of hEGF (in agreement with the results obtained with unpurified E1N2E fusion protein). Replacement of the proline with a tyrosine (E1N2E/Y) caused a remarkable increase in binding affinity of the hEGF/Notch chimera, resulting in an affinity close to 100%. It is concluded that for the A-loop the requirements for receptor binding are very limited in that both the size of the loop and the primary sequence may vary considerably. Only Tyr13 seems to be important, because its presence makes high affinity interaction with the receptor possible. For most of the residues in this region, only a few mutants have been examined in the past, showing that Pro7 in hEGF can be replaced by Leu or Thr and Asp11 can be replaced by Tyr without significant loss of binding affinity. Tyr13, however, can only be replaced by a large hydrophobic residue such as Phe or Leu (reviewed in Ref. 5Groenen L.C. Nice E.C. Burgess A.W. Growth Factors. 1994; 11: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The present data show, however, that even in the absence of a tyrosine at position 13, the chimeric protein can bind the receptor, albeit with a 10-fold lower affinity.Table IIBinding affinity and mitogenic activity of hEGF/Notch chimeras in which hEGF-derived residues are reintroducedAffinityaThe affinity of the hEGF/Notch chimeras for the hEGF receptor was measured in a 125I-mEGF binding competition assay and is expressed as IC50,hEGF/IC50,mutant.MitogenicitybThe mitogenic activity was determined by measuring the ability to stimulate the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into the cellular DNA of quiescent HER-14 cells and is expressed as EC50,hEGF/EC50,mutant.⌈ A-loop ⌉ ⌈ B-loop ⌉ ⌈ C-loop ⌉1 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50hEGFNSDSE C PLSHDGY C LHDGVC MYIEA..LDKYA C NC VVGYIGER C QYRDLKWWELRNotch...

The knowledge of the crystal structure of some of these proteins has helped, but the mechanism of transfer of these proteins across the bilayer is not clear for any of these toxins. DT is composed of three domains, namely the NH2-terminal catalytic domain C (residues 1–193), transmembrane domain T (205–378), and receptor-binding domain R (386–535) (3Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G.

In DT, translocation across the bilayer occurs after receptor-mediated endocytosis to the endosomal compartment where, on acidification, the DT undergoes a conformational change to a conformation conducive to penetration of the bilayer (5Naglich J.G.

Science. 1996; 273: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar).We have investigated the acid-induced conformational changes in DT using the hydrophobic photoactivable reagent 2-[3H]diazofluorene (DAF). This reagent binds to hydrophobic sites in a protein and on photolysis generates a highly reactive carbene that inserts into neighboring groups including C-H bonds. This permits studying of the exposure of hydrophobic domains in a protein. DAF has been used in the past to study successfully the hydrophobic exposure in molten globule state of bovine α-lactalbumin (19Lala A.K. Kaul P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19914-19918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conventionally, such studies have been carried out using polarity-sensitive fluorescent probes like 1-anilino-8-naphthalene sulfonic acid (ANS), which have provided very useful information. However, these probes can at best provide a general picture on the extent of hydrophobic exposure and do not yield information on domains to which the reagent binds. Hydrophobic photoactivable reagents like DAF bind and on photolysis covalently link to the protein so that subsequent fragmentation of the cross-linked protein and peptide sequencing can in principle provide structural information on the hydrophobic sites exposed on change in environmental conditions. We report here the photolabeling of DT as a function of pH; and by analyzing the fragmented peptides we have been able to identify the exposure of hydrophobic sites, most notably in domain T. The current results also suggest that DAF labeling provides an independent method for structural characterization of protein folding intermediates like the equilibrium molten globule state.MATERIALS AND METHODSAll reagents used were of the highest commercial grade purity available. Spectral grade water was obtained using Milli-Q Plus (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Tritiated fluorenone was obtained by catalytic tritium exchange of 2-iodofluoren-9-one, at BRIT, Bombay. DAF (specific activity 535 mCi/mmol) was prepared from 2-[3H]fluorenone according to the procedure reported earlier (20Pradhan D. Lala A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8242-8251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Lala A.K. Raja S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11348-11357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Mutated DT strain (pET.15bψ WTDT in BL-21) with a single E148S mutation was a generous gift from Dr. John Collier. The strain was grown in LB/Amp medium, and DT with an NH2-terminal hexa-His tag was isolated essentially according to the procedure of Collier and co-workers (22Shen W.H. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29077-29084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that 650 m AF-chelate (Ni-IDA agarose) from TOSOHAAS for Ni affinity column chromatography and Resource-Q (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for anion exchange chromatography. The purified toxin was nicked with tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. The intact toxin was found to be a single band as analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE, according to the procedure of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar), whereas the nicked toxin gave rise to two bands corresponding to A-chain and B-chain. The concentration of DT was estimated according to the procedure of Lowry et al. (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 50 mm Tris buffer was used for pH 7.4 experiments, 50 mm phosphate buffer for pH 6.0 and 6.8, and 50 mm sodium acetate buffer for pH 5.6 and 5.2 experiments. Automated Edman degradation of photolabeled peptides was carried out using a Shimadzu gas phase protein sequenator (PPSQ10) connected to an on-line PTH analyzer. The samples loaded either as electroblots on polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane or on glass fiber disks. Fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu model RF-540 spectrofluorometer.Photolabeling experiments were carried out on both analytical and preparative scales. The analytical scale experiments were carried out on 2 ml of a 1 μm solution of DT at pH 5.2, 5.6, 6.0, 6.8, and 7.4. The preparative scale experiments were carried out only at pH 5.2 and 7.4. The preparative scale experiments were carried out to isolate the CNBr fragments in sufficient quantity so that they could be sequenced for at least 30 cycles. In these experiments 10 ml of a 1 μm solution of DT was taken in a glass tube, and an ethanolic solution of DAF (30 μCi, 50 nmol) was added so that the final ethanol concentration was less than 2% v/v. This solution was incubated in the dark for 10 min and then photolyzed for 2 min in a Rayonet minireactor with four 3500 Å lamps at a distance of 6 cm from the lamps. In a control experiment, the sample containing DT incubated with DAF was not photolyzed. Unreacted DAF, if any, was destroyed by the addition of glacial acetic acid to a final concentration of 1m. 20 μg (0.33 nmol) of photolabeled toxin sample was analyzed directly on a 12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was then stained in 0.1% Coomassie Blue and destained in a solution containing 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol in water. The gel was then sliced into 2-mm pieces and digested into 250 μl of 30% H2O2 at 60 °C for 8–10 h. The digested samples were counted in a toluene-based scintillation mixture. The remaining part of the preparative photolabeled sample (9.67 nmol) was subjected to chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) extraction twice. The aqueous layer was then subjected to precipitation with 10% trichloroacetic acid. After the addition of trichloroacetic acid (10% final concentration), the suspension was cooled for 30 min over ice. The pellet was then washed three times with cold acetone. The photolabeled DT was then subjected to CNBr fragmentation in 70% formic acid. The CNBr digest of photolabeled DT was run on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gel system (25Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) and electroblotted immediately onto a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-PSQ, Millipore Corp.) using 10 mmCAPS containing 30% methanol in transfer buffer (26Mozdzanowski J. Speicher D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The PVDF membrane was stained for 1 min in 0.1% Coomassie Blue and destained in 50% methanol/water. The radioactive bands were excised and analyzed by sequencing in an automated gas phase protein sequenator. All experiments were carried out in duplicate.RESULTSDAF was incubated with DT in dark and then photolyzed with light of wavelength greater than 350 nm for 2 min. Analysis of DAF-labeled DT indicated that DAF was covalently linked to DT, and the bound radioactivity could not be dissociated from DT by solvent extraction or during SDS-PAGE. In a control experiment carried out in the dark, DAF was not found to be associated with DT, indicating that the observed labeling was photochemical in nature. The DAF-labeled DT was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, which indicated an increase in labeling with a decrease in pH (Fig. 1 A). Further analysis indicated that DAF labeled both the A-chain (0.16%) and the B-chain (0.17%) to a similar extent at pH 7.4; however, at lower pH values the labeling increased considerably for B-chain relative to the A-chain. Thus at pH 5.2, B-chain labeling was observed to be considerably higher (1.43%) than that of A-chain (0.38%) (Fig. 1 B). NH2-terminal sequencing of both A- and B-chain allowed identification of these chains by the released PTH-derivatives. However, no radioactivity was found to be associated up to 20 cycles, indicating that neither chain is labeled by DAF at the NH2 terminus.ANS is a polarity-sensitive fluorescent probe, which, on movement into a nonpolar medium, gives rise to an increase in fluorescence intensity and a blue shift. It has been used extensively to detect hydrophobic exposure in proteins (27Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum, New York1983Crossref Google Scholar, 28Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar, 29Engelhard M. Evans P.A. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) as it binds to hydrophobic sites in proteins leading to increase in fluorescence intensity. In an experiment conducted in parallel to the DAF labeling experiment, ANS was added to DT and fluorescence changes noted. Fig. 1 Aindicates an increase in the fluorescence intensity of ANS on lowering of the pH in a manner similar to DAF labeling.To obtain information on the degree of labeling of the three different functional domains in DT, namely the NH2-terminal catalytic domain C (residues 1–193), transmembrane domain T (205–378), and receptor-binding domain R (386–535), we took advantage of the well spread eight methionine residues (14Silverman J.A. Mindell J.A. Finkelstein A. Shen W.H. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22524-22532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 115, 178, 182, 230, 314, 339, 459) in DT. Three representative CNBr fragments, CN-3 (116–178), CN-8 (340–459), and the COOH-terminal CN-9 (460–535), corresponding to each of the functional regions, were chosen and monitored for DAF labeling. Thus DT was photolabeled with DAF at pH 7.4 and 5.2, and the resulting product was cleaved with CNBr and separated by SDS-PAGE.M r and NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the electroblotted bands identified the three fragments. Fig. 2 indicates that all three fragments are labeled; but on lowering of the pH, the increase in labeling is considerably higher in the case of CN-8 and CN-9 relative to the CN-3 fragment. These data confirm the results obtained with A- and B-chain labeling, the latter being labeled to a greater degree at low pH values. The NH2-terminus of the CN-8 fragment corresponds to two long hydrophobic helices, TH-8 and TH-9, which form a helical hairpin in the core of domain T and are covered by a layer of relatively less hydrophobic helices TH-5 to TH-7, forming a quasi-helical hairpin and finally another layer of hydrophilic TH-1 to TH-4 helices. It has been proposed that lowering the pH causes the hydrophobic TH-8 and TH-9 to be solvent-exposed, leading to their insertion into membranes (18Oh K.J. Zhan H. Cui C. Hideg K. Collier R.J. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1996; 273: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 30Zhan H. Oh K.J. Shin Y. Hubbell W.L. Collier R.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4856-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus the isolated domain T or the peptide fragment corresponding to the TH-8 and TH-9 regions can form voltage-dependent channels in planar bilayers under low pH conditions (pH ∼ 5) (16Silverman J.A. Mindell J.A. Zhan H. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Membr. Biol. 1994; 137: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 17Mindell J.A. Silverman J.A. Collier R.J. Finkelstein A. J. Membr.

The maximum increase in labeling the CN-8 fragment is in keeping with these proposals.Figure 2Radioactivity associated with CNBr fragments CN-3 (116–178), CN-8 (340–459), and CN-9 (460–535) obtained from DT photolabeled with DAF at pH 5.2 (hatched bars) and 7.4 (blank bars). DAF-photolabeled DT was taken in 70% formic acid, and CNBr was added at a 250:1 molar ratio of CNBr to methionine residue. The preparation was then digested for 48 h at 37 °C. The sample was diluted 20 times by adding 1–2 ml of water and lyophilized. This process of hydration and lyophilization was repeated three times, and finally the sample was lyophilized to dryness. The concentrated samples were then analyzed on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels according to Schagger and Von Jagow (25Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)To glean information on the amino acid residues that undergo maximum exposure on lowering of pH and are labeled by hydrophobic reagent DAF, the three CNBr fragments mentioned above were isolated from preparative scale experiments and the peptides subjected to sequencing. The PTH-derivative analysis was then carried out, and the radioactivity associated with each cycle was determined. All experiments were minimally carried out in duplicate, and the sequencing data obtained from independent photolabeling experiments were found to be similar in reference to radioactivity associated with labeled residues. The CN-8 fragment from DT labeled at pH 7.4 and 5.2 could be both sequenced and identified. However, the radioactivity associated with each cycle of the CN-8 fragment from the pH 7.4 experiment was insignificant compared with the data obtained from the pH 5.2 experiment. The radioactivity release was observed to be below the background level after nine cycles in the pH 7.4 experiment (data not shown). In the pH 5.2 experiment extensive labeling was observed as indicated by radioactivity release, and sequence assignments could be made up to 42 cycles (Fig. 3). The bulk of radioactivity was found to be associated with Pro-345, which is a part of TH-8 helix (326–347). Other residues labeled, although to a much lesser degree, were Ile-365, Phe-368, Val-371, Pro-378, and Ala-379. These residues belong to the hydrophobic TH-9 helix (358–376); the region that immediately follows it, often referred to as the hinge-loop region, separates domains T and R (4Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 32Bennett M.J. Choe S. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1444-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A similar sequence analysis of the CN-9 fragment could be carried out up to 26 cycles. The radioactive analysis indicated labeling of residues Ile-464, Thr-469, Cys-471, Pro-473, Ser-475, and Val-483 (Fig. 4). These residues belong to the β-sheets, RB-6, RB-7, and the beginning of RB-8 in domain R. As observed earlier in the case of CN-8, sequencing of the CN-9 fragment from DT labeled by DAF at pH 7.4 indicated that practically no radioactivity was associated with different cycles of sequencing. The CN-3 fragment isolated from DT labeled with DAF at pH 5.2 could be sequenced up to 37 cycles, beyond which the pmol yield of the PTH-derivative was too low to make definitive assignments. The major amino acids labeled in CN-3 were Val-118, Ile-123, Val-134, Val-135, Leu-138, Phe-140, and Tyr-149 (Fig. 5). However, unlike CN-8 and CN-9, the sequencing of the CN-3 fragment isolated from DT labeled by DAF at pH 7.4 produced a labeling pattern similar to that at pH 5.2. This is in keeping with similar levels of radioactivity associated with CN-3 fragment isolated from labeling at pH 5.2 and 7.4 (Fig. 2).Figure 3Radioactivity and mass release on Edman degradation of CNBr fragment CN-8 (340–459) of DAF-labeled DT at pH 5.2. The CNBr digest of DAF-labeled DT was run on a 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels according to Schagger and Von Jagow (25Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar) and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane according to the procedure of Mozdzanowski and Speicher (26Mozdzanowski J. Speicher D.W. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 207: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The PVDF membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue, then the stained bands were marked and immediately destained. The Coomassie Blue staining pattern on PVDF was similar to that observed on SDS-PAGE staining. Three bands corresponding to M r of CN-3, CN-8, and CN-9 were clearly visible on the PVDF membrane. These bands were excised after destaining and subjected to automated Edman degradation. After each Edman degradation cycle 60% of the sample was analyzed by direct injection on an on-line PTH analyzer for PTH-derivative release (pmol, ▪). The remaining 40% of the sample was directed to a fraction collector and subsequently counted (cpm, ♦). A single peptide beginning with Val-340 was detected.

These fragments were then subjected to peptide sequencing, and the radioactivity associated with P-345 was determined. The data given in Fig. 6 clearly indicate increased labeling of Pro-345 on lowering of pH with a sharp rise below pH 5.6.Figure 6Radioactivity and mass release on Edman degradation of CNBr fragment CN-8 (340–459) isolated from DT labeled with DAF as a function of pH.

Thus, although both probes can provide general information on exposure of hydrophobic sites as observed in DT as a function of pH, it is the covalent linkage of DAF with the protein and the subsequent radioactive analysis of peptide fragments derived from the labeled protein which make radioactive hydrophobic photoactivable reagents like DAF a useful probe. An earlier study using another hydrophobic photoactivable reagent, 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyldiazirine, also indicated an increase in the photolabeling of DT as the pH was lowered, although no peptide sequencing data were reported in this study (33Dumont M.E. Richards F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2087-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The option to sequence the isolated DAF-labeled peptides by Edman degradation and determine the actual amino acid, which has been labeled from the radioactive profile, is what makes these types of probes a powerful structural tool. Thus a relatively much higher hydrophobic exposure of B-chain than the A-chain of DT on lowering of pH could be established easily using DAF (Fig. 1). The radioactive analysis of CNBr fragments of DAF-labeled DT indicated that the TH-8 and TH-9 hydrophobic helices are exposed maximally on lowering of pH. The TH-8 and TH-9 helices that form part of the transmembrane domain T have been implicated in membrane insertion by x-ray structural data (3Choe S. Bennett M.J. Fujii G. Curmi P.M.G. Kantardjieff K.A. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Nature. 1992; 357: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar,4Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1464-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and several site-directed mutagenesis studies (14Silverman J.A. Mindell J.A. Finkelstein A. Shen W.H. Collier R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22524-22532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Silverman J.A. Mindell J.A. Zhan H. Finkelstein A. Collier R.J. J. Membr.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 687-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).The major conclusions that can be drawn from the sequencing data are as follows. 1) On lowering of pH, the CN-8 fragment of domain T is labeled most heavily followed by the CN-9 fragment belonging to domain R. Apparently as the pH is lowered the hydrophobic sites in DT are exposed, leading to binding of DAF to the most hydrophobic site, which on photolysis is manifested in terms of radioactivity associated with the peptide fragment. The CN-3 fragment belonging to domain C is labeled most poorly when the pH is lowered, suggesting that this region of the molecule undergoes minimum conformational change on lowering of pH, which is in agreement with the recent crystal structure of isolated domain C determined at pH 5 (35Weiss M.S. Blanke S.R. Collier R.J. Eisenberg D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 773-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 2) Because the labeling of CN-3 is significant at both pH 7.4 and 5.2 (Fig. 2), the current results indicate that domain C contains several hydrophobic sites. These results suggest that the CN-3, CN-8, and CN-9 fragments, corresponding to parts of domains C, T, and R, respectively, have several hydrophobic sites exposed at low pH and can thus be expected to interact with membranes. However, although the CN-8 and CN-9 fragments show a considerable increase in hydrophobic exposure when the pH is lowered, the CN-3 fragment does not (Fig. 2), suggesting that the pH-induced insertion process is not triggered by domain C. 3) The amino acids labeled are predominantly hydrophobic, indicating that the otherwise buried hydrophobic amino acids are exposed at low pH thereby making the toxin conducive to insertion in membranes. 4) The two buried hydrophobic helices, identified in the crystal structure and suggested to insert and span the membrane bilayer (3Choe S.

BFA treatment for 12 h also resulted in complete loss of transcobalamin II receptor (TC II-R) activity/protein levels in the BLM and the disappearance of trans-Golgi network (TGN) morphology as revealed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy using antibody to TGN 38. However, BFA treatment had no effect on either total cellular cholesterol, TC II-R activity, or PL levels. When cells treated with BFA for 12 h were exposed to BFA-free medium for 0–24 h, all of the effects were reversed, including reappearance of normal TGN morphology. TC II-R delivered to the BLM during this period was progressively sialylated and changed its physical state from a monomer (8 h) to a dimer (12 h), coinciding with increased delivery (11–53 pmol) of cholesterol to the BLM and an increase in the BLM r s from 0.15 to 0.21. These results indicate that cholesterol, but not PL, delivery to the BLM of Caco-2 cells is BFA-sensitive, and cholesterol, by influencing the higher order of the BLM, is essential for TC II-R dimerization.

J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) have revealed that at steady state, TC II-R dimer levels are 8–10-fold higher than that of the monomer in all total tissue membranes tested and that TC II-R dimers are present in the PM and in some PM-derived vesicles, while TC II-R monomers are the only species present in the microsomes (4Bose S. Seetharam S. Hammond T.G. Seetharam B. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Earlier in vitro studies (3Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using isolated tissue PMs and microsomes have revealed that TC II-R dimerization is supported in the plasma but not in the microsomal membranes due to their higher cholesterol content. Additional studies using symmetrical phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles have shown that a minimum of 10 mol % of cholesterol is essential to support TC II-R dimerization above the transition temperatures of these PC vesicles (3Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the importance of membrane cholesterol levels and cholesterol-phospholipid interactions in the dimerization of TC II-R in tissue-derived PMs and in PC vesicles is established (3Bose S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is not known how the dimerization of TC II-R is regulated at a cellular level and whether cellular PM cholesterol levels are important for the dimerization of TC II-R. These issues have been addressed in the current study using polarized epithelial Caco-2 cells that express TC II-R predominantly (85%) in the BLM (5Bose S. Komorowski R.A. Seetharam S. Gilfix B.

Our aim in the current study was to test whether BFA affected BLM delivery of major lipids such as cholesterol and PL in Caco-2 cells and, if so, whether it also affected the BLM delivery and dimerization of TC II-R. The results of the current study show that in Caco-2 cells, delivery of cholesterol, but not PL, to the BLM is BFA-sensitive. As a consequence of decreased cholesterol levels, TC II-R monomers delivered to the BLM during the incubation of BFA-treated cells with BFA-free medium were able to dimerize only after 12 h of incubation, when cholesterol levels of the BLM and its order were restored to nearly normal values.

Wilde (Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco). The secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmuneResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Caco-2 cells (passages 76–80) were routinely grown in DMEM (25 mm glucose) as described earlier (5Bose S. Komorowski R.A. Seetharam S. Gilfix B. Rosenblatt D.S. Seetharam B. J. Biol.

For ligand binding and domain-specific biotinylation studies cells were grown as epithelial layers by high density seeding (1.5 × 106 cells/filter) onto membrane filter inserts (Millicell-HA, 30-mm diameter, 0.45-μm pore size) and used as described before (5Bose S.

Postconfluent Caco-2 cells grown on plastic using 75-cm2 flasks were first incubated in the presence and absence of BFA (5 μg/ml) for 12 h at 37 °C. The medium was replaced with methionine-free DMEM, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. The cells were then labeled with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/flask/8 ml of medium) for 60 min. BFA (5 μg/ml) was present during both these incubations. The cells were then harvested, washed, and homogenized in 1 ml of Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 140 mm NaCl and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (TBS). The homogenate was then treated with Triton X-100 (1%), and the detergent extract was immunoprecipitated with TC II-R antiserum (25 μl) and protein A-Sepharose (125 μl of 1:1 suspension). The radioactive counts were liberated by boiling with SDS (1%), and the liberated radioactivity was subjected to acetone precipitation to remove SDS. The precipitated radioactivity was further processed for treatment with various glycosidases essentially as described earlier (18Bose S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20920-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Postconfluent Caco-2 cells that were incubated for 12 h in the absence or presence of BFA (5 μg/ml) were pulsed for 1 h with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/flask). In some experiments, the cells treated with BFA were incubated with BFA free medium for 0–16 h. The cells were then extracted with TBS containing Triton X-100 and centrifuged. The extract was immunoprecipitated with TC II-R antiserum (25 μl) and protein A-Sepharose (125 μl). The radioactivity immunoprecipitated (25,000–28,000 cpm) was liberated with TBS containing SDS (1%) followed by precipitation with acetone to remove SDS. The precipitated radioactivity was resolubilized with TBS containing Triton X-100 (1%), and the solubilized radioactivity (20,000 cpm) was incubated withS. nigra agglutinin-agarose beads. The beads were washed with TBS, and the beads were pelleted and counted. As a control,35S-TC II-R immunoprecipitated (20,000 cpm) from cells not treated with BFA was digested with sialidase and then allowed to bind to S. nigra agglutinin-agarose beads, and the radioactivity bound was washed and counted as before. The radioactivity eluted fromS. nigra agglutinin-agarose beads was subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Human TC II (5 μg) and streptavidin (50 μg) were each iodinated with 0.5 mCi of Na125I and IODO-GEN, as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce). The specific activity of iodinated TC II and streptavidin was 70–75 μCi/μg and 6–7 μCi/μg, respectively. Filter grown Caco-2 cells that were exposed to BFA (5 μg/ml) for 12 h were washed and then incubated with BFA-free DMEM for 8–24 h. The medium was removed, and the filters were incubated in the presence and absence of TC II-Cbl (10 pmol) on the basolateral side with DMEM containing 125I-TC II-Cbl (500 fmol, 200,000 dpm) for 30 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed with fresh medium and then incubated with 4 mm disuccinimidyl suberate for 30 min at 4 °C. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of glycine (0.1 mm). The cells were harvested and homogenized (1 ml of TBS), and the total membrane collected by centrifugation was then analyzed on nonreducing SDS-PAGE (5%). The bands were visualized after autoradiography. Isolated total membranes (25 μg of protein) from Caco-2 cells that were exposed to BFA (0, 2, 5, 10 μg/ml) for 12 h or cells that were allowed to recover from BFA effects for various times (0–24 h) were subjected to nonreducing SDS-PAGE (7.5%) (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were electroblotted for either 45 or 90 min at 90 V to detect optimal levels of TC II-R monomer and dimer forms, respectively, onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with TC II-R antiserum and 125I-protein A as described previously (3Bose S.

The medium was replaced with fresh medium without BFA, and the cells were incubated for 0–24 h. The cationic probe trimethylammoniumdiphenyl hexatriene dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (0.1 pmol/filter) was added to the basolateral medium 30 min before the allocated time of 2–24 h. The cells were then harvested at each time interval, washed in TBS, and finally suspended in 3 ml of TBS and used for fluorescent polarization studies in a 3-ml quartz cuvette with constant stirring (250 rpm). Fluorescence anisotropy (r s) was determined at room temperature using a model 4800 C spectra fluorometer (SLM-Aminco Inc., Rochester, NY). The excitation and emission wavelengths were 360 and 430 nm, respectively. Correction for light scattering was carried out by successive dilutions of the cell suspension until a plateau value of polarization was obtained. Steady stater s was determined at least 10 times for each sample at each dilution from three sets of cells treated with trimethylammoniumdiphenyl hexatriene from three separate experiments, and the r s values were calculated according to Van Blitterswijk et al. (20Van Blitterswijk M.J. Van Hoeven R.O. Van Der Meer B.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 644: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Postconfluent cells untreated and treated with BFA (5 μg/ml) for 12 h were first incubated with methionine-free DMEM for 30 min and then pulsed for 1 h with [35S]methionine (200 μCi/flask) in the presence of BFA. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with DMEM and then chased for 0–16 h with DMEM containing methionine (20 mm and BFA). The 35S-labeled TC II-R isolated at each time interval by immunoprecipitation was further processed for nonreducing SDS-PAGE as described before (18Bose S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20920-20928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Postconfluent Caco-2 cells grown on filters were incubated in the presence and absence of BFA (5 μg/ml) for 12 h. In some experiments, the cells were allowed to recover from the effects of BFA by incubation in BFA-free medium for 24 h. Following incubations, the filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde followed by sequential incubations with the primary antibody (rabbit polyclonal TGN 38 antibody) for 1 h at 37 °C and Texas red-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-rabbit) for 30 min at 37 °C in the dark. The samples were then analyzed using a krypton-argon laser coupled with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal head attached to an Optiphot II Nikon microscope with a plan Apo 60 × 1.4 NA objective lens. Reconstitution of pure sialylated and asialo-TC II-R in total BBM lipid extracts was carried out using 2 μmol of total PL and either sialylated or asialo-TC II-R (0.25 μg) as described previously (3Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). TC II-R assays were performed using partially purified TC II from human serum (22Lindemans J. Van Kappel J. Abels J. Scan. J. Lab. Clin. Invest. 1986; 46: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). TC II-[57Co]Cbl complex was prepared for receptor assays by the charcoal adsorption method (23Lau K. Gottlieb C. Wasserman L. Blood. 1965; 26: 202-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Basolateral cell surface binding of human TC II-[57Co]Cbl (500 fmol) using filter-grown Caco-2 cells was determined by incubating the ligand at 4 °C for 30 min. After 30 min, the medium was removed, cells were washed in cold medium, and the amount of TC II-[57Co]Cbl bound to the surface membrane was determined by counting the radioactivity in scraped cells. The TC II-R-specific ligand binding was then calculated by subtracting the amount of ligand bound to the cell surfaces in the presence of TC II-R antiserum (5–20 μl) or that bound when the ligand was incubated at 5 °C in the presence of pH5/EDTA buffer. In general, the nonspecific binding was less than 5% of the total ligand bound. Total membranes from scraped Caco-2 cells were prepared by collecting the pellet obtained by centrifuging a 10% homogenate of the cells prepared in TBS containing 0.25 msucrose, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 100,000 × g for 60 min. BLMs from BFA-treated and -untreated cells were isolated according to Ellis et al. (24Ellis J.A. Jackman M.R. Luzio J.P. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 553-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The BLM fraction was enriched for TC II-R, and a marker enzyme, Na+/K+ ATPase, was enriched 15- and 17-fold with 18 and 20% recoveries, respectively. Total lipid extract was prepared from total cellular homogenate (2 mg of protein) and the isolated BLM (210–220 μg of protein) by extraction with chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic layer was removed and used for total PL and cholesterol estimation as described previously (3Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Incubation of Caco-2 cells for 12 h with BFA (0.5–10 μg/ml) revealed inhibition of BLM but not total cellular ligand binding by 50 and 100% at BFA concentrations of 0.5 and 5 μg/ml, respectively (Fig. 1). When incubated with 5 μg/ml BFA for less than 12 h, ligand binding to BLM was inhibited by 50, 75, and 90% inhibition occurring at 2, 4, and 8 h of incubation, respectively. Thus, in all subsequent experiments cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml BFA for 12 h. Immunoblotting of total cell membranes (Fig. 2) from untreated cells revealed that TC II-R was a dimer with a molecular mass of 124 kDa (Fig. 2,left panel), and TC II-R monomer with a molecular mass of 62 kDa could not be detected (Fig. 2, right panel). When cells were incubated with 2, 5, and 10 μg/ml BFA for 12 h, concentrations that inhibited BLM TC II-R activity by >95%, the dimer form of TC II-R disappeared (Fig. 2,left panel), and the monomer form was the only form present (Fig. 2, right panel). Image density quantitation (data not shown) of these bands revealed equal intensity, suggesting that there was no loss of TC II-R protein. However, the size of TC II-R monomer was 56 kDa, nearly 6 kDa less than the size of monomeric TC II-R in untreated cells. Pulse-chase labeling of Caco-2 cells in the presence and absence of BFA (5 μg/ml) revealed on SDS-PAGE a single immunoprecipitated band of 56 and 62 kDa, respectively, and the t½ of TC II-R in both cases was 7.5 h (data not shown). The pulse-chase experiment supported further the findings of the immunoblot using total membranes (Fig. 2) that BFA treatment did not alter the turnover of TC II-R and that the size of intracellularly retained TC II-R monomer was lower by 6 kDa. Immunoblotting of total membranes of Caco-2 cells recovering from the effects of BFA (Fig. 3) revealed TC II-R dimers with a molecular mass of 124 kDa in untreated cells (left panel, lane C) and from cells that had recovered from the effects of BFA for 12 and 24 h, but not for 0–8 h. TC II-R monomer was detected only in cells that had recovered from BFA treatment for 0–8 h (Fig. 3,right panel) and not in untreated cells (right panel, lane C). Since TC II-R dimers were detected in the total membranes only after 12 h of recovery from BFA, we wanted to test during the different recovery periods whether TC II-R is delivered to the BLM and, if so, whether it is delivered as a monomer or as a dimer. When the filter-grown cells exposed to BFA for 12 h were incubated with BFA-free medium for 2–24 h, there was a gradual recovery of BLM ligand binding activity (Fig. 4, left panel) with 50 and 95% recovery at 8 and 16 h, respectively. Biotinylation of BLM followed by SDS-PAGE of the immunoprecipitated extract of cells during the recovery period (Fig. 4,right panel) revealed progressive recovery of TC II-R protein with time (0–24 h), and the molecular mass of TC II-R increased from 56 to 62 kDa during this period. Quantitation of these bands (Fig. 4, left panel) revealed a linear relationship between the recovery of TC II-R protein and the BLM ligand binding activity. Nearly 50% recovery of ligand binding and TC II-R protein levels occurred following 8 h of exposure to BFA-free medium when the molecular mass of TC II-R was less than 62 kDa. TC II-R detected on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4, right panel) used samples that were extracted with Triton X-100, a treatment that completely solubilizes TC II-R and converts it to the monomeric form (2Bose S. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8152-8157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 3Bose S. Fiex J. Seetharam S. Seetharam B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11718-11725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, it was not possible to assess whether TC II-R delivered to BLM during the recovery was a monomer or a dimer. However, chemical cross-linking the BLM of intact cells grown on culture inserts with 125I-TC II-Cbl (Fig. 5) during the recovery periods revealed a cross-linked product with a molecular mass of 99–100 kDa (lane 2) at 8 h of reversal time, while it was 210 kDa at 12 (lane 3) and 24 (lane 4) h of reversal time. The size of 99 kDa of the receptor-ligand complex for BLM at 8 h of reversal is consistent with the binding of the 43-kDa ligand (lane 1) by a receptor with a molecular mass of 56 kDa. The eventual change in the size of the cross-linked product to a molecular mass of 210 kDa is consistent with the binding of 2 mol of ligand (86 kDa/dimer) to a receptor of molecular mass of 124 kDa. Similar sized cross-linked product was also obtained by cross-linking the BLM from untreated cells (lane 5). These results indicated that during the reversal of BFA effects, TC II-R delivered to BLM as a monomer is unable to dimerize for up to 8 h of reversal time. The size of monomeric form of TC II-R retained in the cells following treatment with BFA was 56 kDa, while the size of BLM TC II-R from cells recovering from BFA (Fig. 4, right panel) increased from 56 to 62 kDa. These observations suggested that BFA treatment may inhibit terminal sialylation of the TC II-R oligosaccharides and that progressive recovery of sialylation may occur during the recovery period. In order to directly test these possibilities, the following experiments were carried out. The molecular mass of [35S]methionine-labeled immunoprecipitated TC II-R monomer was 62 kDa in BFA-untreated cells (Fig. 6, lanes 1and 7) and was 56 kDa in treated cells (lanes 4 and 10) cells. Following treatment with sialidase, the 62-kDa TC II-R from untreated cells was converted to 56 kDa (lane 8), while similar treatment of the 56-kDa form of TC II-R obtained from BFA-treated cells resulted in the shift equivalent to 55 kDa (lane 11). When the labeled receptor from both untreated (lane 9) and BFA-treated (lane 12) cells were further digested withO-glycanase, a shift equivalent to 9–10 kDa was noted. This observation clearly indicated that BFA-treatment did not inhibit coreO-glycosylation of TC II-R but only the terminal sialylation of these sugars. In addition, BFA treatment also had no effect on the maturation of a single N-linked oligosaccharide of TC II-R, since the labeled receptors from both the untreated (lane 1) and treated (lane 4) cells were resistant to endo-β-N-a"
https://openalex.org/W2068381617,"A large number of plasmids have been shown to replicate by a rolling circle (RC) mechanism. The initiators encoded by these plasmids have origin-specific, nicking-closing activity that is required for the initiation and termination of RC replication. Since the initiators of many RC plasmids are rate-limiting for replication, these proteins are usually inactivated after supporting one round of replication. In the case of the pT181 plasmid, inactivation of the initiator RepC protein occurs by the attachment of an oligonucleotide to its active tyrosine residue. We have generated the inactivated form of RepC, termed RepC*, in vitro and investigated the effects of attachment of the oligonucleotide on its various biochemical activities. Our results demonstrate that while RepC* is inactive in nicking-closing and replication activities due to the blockage of its active tyrosine residue, it is competent in origin DNA binding and DNA religation activities. We have investigated the oligomeric state of RepC and RepC* and found that RepC exists as a dimer in solution and can oligomerize on the DNA. We have generated heterodimers in vitro between the wild-type and epitope-tagged RepC proteins. In electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, the initiator heterodimers generated a novel DNA-protein complex, demonstrating that it binds to DNA as a dimer. We have shown that a DNA binding mutant of RepC can be targeted to the origin in the presence of the wild-type protein primarily through a protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, RepC* is defective in its ability to oligomerize on the DNA. RepC* inhibited the DNA binding and replication activity of wild-type RepC to only a very limited extent, suggesting that it may play only a minor regulatory role in replication in vivo. Based on these and earlier results, we propose a model for the role of RepC during the initiation and termination of pT181 RC replication. A large number of plasmids have been shown to replicate by a rolling circle (RC) mechanism. The initiators encoded by these plasmids have origin-specific, nicking-closing activity that is required for the initiation and termination of RC replication. Since the initiators of many RC plasmids are rate-limiting for replication, these proteins are usually inactivated after supporting one round of replication. In the case of the pT181 plasmid, inactivation of the initiator RepC protein occurs by the attachment of an oligonucleotide to its active tyrosine residue. We have generated the inactivated form of RepC, termed RepC*, in vitro and investigated the effects of attachment of the oligonucleotide on its various biochemical activities. Our results demonstrate that while RepC* is inactive in nicking-closing and replication activities due to the blockage of its active tyrosine residue, it is competent in origin DNA binding and DNA religation activities. We have investigated the oligomeric state of RepC and RepC* and found that RepC exists as a dimer in solution and can oligomerize on the DNA. We have generated heterodimers in vitro between the wild-type and epitope-tagged RepC proteins. In electrophoretic mobility shift experiments, the initiator heterodimers generated a novel DNA-protein complex, demonstrating that it binds to DNA as a dimer. We have shown that a DNA binding mutant of RepC can be targeted to the origin in the presence of the wild-type protein primarily through a protein-protein interaction. Interestingly, RepC* is defective in its ability to oligomerize on the DNA. RepC* inhibited the DNA binding and replication activity of wild-type RepC to only a very limited extent, suggesting that it may play only a minor regulatory role in replication in vivo. Based on these and earlier results, we propose a model for the role of RepC during the initiation and termination of pT181 RC replication. Bacterial plasmids provide useful model systems to study the mechanism and regulation of DNA replication.

Replication of RC plasmids is mechanistically similar to those of single-stranded (SS) DNA bacteriophages of Escherichia coli (4Baas P.D. Jansz H.S. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1988; 136: 31-70PubMed Google Scholar, 5Reinberg D. Zipurski S.L. Weisbeek P. Brown D. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 529-537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Zinder N.D.

Replication of RC plasmids is initiated by the generation of a single strand nick at the origin of replication by the plasmid-encoded initiator proteins. Plasmids of the pT181 family in Staphylococcus aureus encode initiators that have origin-specific DNA binding and topoisomerase-like activities (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A.

The origin of replication of pT181 consists of three sets of inverted repeat (IR) elements, termed IRI, IRII, and IRIII (Ref. 10Wang P.-Z. Projan S.J. Henriquez V. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the pT181 origin contains a bend that is enhanced by binding of RepC (11Koepsel R.R. Khan S.A. Science. 1986; 233: 1316-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The pT181 origin also contains a cruciform region centered around IRII, and RepC has been shown to enhance cruciform extrusion (12Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8560-8564Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that while both IRII and IRIII are required for initiation of replication, IRII is sufficient for the termination step (13Zhao A.C. Khan S.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5222-5228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,14Zhao A.C. Khan S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The RepC protein consists of 314 amino acids with a molecular weight of 38,000 (15Khan S.A. Novick R.P. Plasmid. 1983; 10: 251-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 16Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8571-8577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Footprinting studies have shown that the initiator encoded by pT181, RepC, binds to IRIII and the proximal arm of IRII (Ref. 8Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar; Fig. 1). The RepC nick site is located between nt 70 and 71 within the loop of IRII (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). After nicking, RepC becomes covalently attached to the 5′-phosphate of the DNA through the active site tyrosine residue at position 191 (17Dempsey L.A. Birch P. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3083-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 18Thomas C.D. Balson D.F. Shaw W.V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1988; 16: 758-759Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The sequence-specific DNA binding domain of RepC has been identified, and amino acids 267–270 in RepC were shown to be important for this activity (19Dempsey L.A. Birch P. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24538-24543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pT181 is maintained at an approximate copy number of 22 (20Carleton S. Projan S.J. Highlander S.K. Moghazeh S.M. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2407-2414Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that RepC is rate-limiting for replication and that the primary mode of regulation of pT181 copy number involves a transcription attenuation mechanism of RepC mRNA by an antisense RNA (21Bargonetti J. Wang P.-Z. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3659-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 22Novick R.P. Iordanescu S. Projan S.J. Kornblum J. Edelman I. Cell. 1989; 59: 395-404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that overexpression of RepCin vivo can inhibit pT181 replication, probably due to the titration of the rate-limiting PcrA helicase (23Iordanescu S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 241: 185-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Iordanescu S. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 25Jin R. Fernandez-Beros M.-E. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4456-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To prevent the reutilization of an initiator molecule that has been used for a round of replication, RepC is inactivated by the attachment of an approximately 11-nt-long oligonucleotide corresponding to pT181 positions 70–60 located immediately downstream of the initiator nick site (26Rasooly A. Novick R.P. Science. 1993; 262: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 27Rasooly A. Wang P.-Z. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5245-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This probably results from the passage of the replication fork past the RepC nick site to the end of IRII (nt 60) after one round of replication and the subsequent cleavage and religation of the DNA by RepC (3Khan S.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 442-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 14Zhao A.C. Khan S.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Interestingly, preparations of the initiator protein from cells containing either wild-type pT181 or its copy mutants contain an approximately 1:1 mixture of the RepC and RepC* forms (27Rasooly A. Wang P.-Z. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5245-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 28Jin R. Rasooly A. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 141-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on this and other findings, it has been proposed that RepC exists as a dimer in solution and that attachment of the oligonucleotide to one subunit results in the inactivation of the other, wild-type subunit by an as yet unknown mechanism (25Jin R. Fernandez-Beros M.-E. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4456-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Rasooly A. Wang P.-Z. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5245-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recently, the RepC/RepC* heterodimer isolated from pT181-containing cells was found to retain its DNA binding activity but was defective in its ability to induce cruciform extrusion at the origin (25Jin R. Fernandez-Beros M.-E. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4456-4466Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 28Jin R. Rasooly A. Novick R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 141-147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Jin R. Zhou X. Novick R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31086-31091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Since preparations of RepC* from pT181-containing cells always contain a 1:1 mixture of RepC and RepC* forms, we have generated RepC* in vitro. This preparation consists of approximately 95% of the molecules in the RepC* form and is suitable for investigation of its biochemical activities. We have studied the oligomeric state of RepC and found that RepC exists as a dimer in solution and can oligomerize upon binding to the DNA. We also report here the finding that while RepC* also exists as a dimer in solution, attachment of an oligonucleotide to the initiator protein blocks its oligomerization at the origin. Our results also demonstrate that while RepC* is defective in its DNA nicking and replication activities, it retains origin binding and DNA religation activities. Wild-type RepC protein was purified using an overexpression system as described earlier (16Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8571-8577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the production of the maltose binding protein (MBP)-RepC fusion protein (MBP-RepC), the repC gene was cloned in frame with the MBP coding sequence utilizing the vector pMAL-c, which contains the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducibletac promoter (30Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 67: 21-30Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). This resulted in the generation of a MBP-RepC fusion protein (80-kDa) in which MBP was present at the amino-terminal end of RepC. Synthesis of the fusion protein was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to exponentially growing cultures, and the MBP-RepC fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on amylose-resin columns (30Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 67: 21-30Crossref Scopus (541) Google Scholar). The MBP-RepC fusion protein was eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm maltose, and the fractions were dialyzed against RepC buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% ethylene glycol). The RepC and MBP-RepC proteins were generally more than 95% pure as determined by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Heterodimers between the RepC and MBP-RepC proteins were generated by denaturation in vitro. Equimolar amounts of the two proteins were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 h in RepC buffer containing 7 m urea. This was followed by successive dialysis of the protein against RepC buffer containing 3m urea, 1 m urea, and no urea. As controls, the RepC and MBP-RepC proteins were treated individually in a similar manner. Seventy micrograms of RepC protein were incubated with an approximately 4-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide containing the right arm and loop of IRII (pT181 nt 75–60) at 32 °C for 15 min. Substantial amounts of the unreacted oligonucleotide were removed by centrifugation of the reaction mixture on a G-50 spin column. However, this RepC* preparation was further purified by FPLC (described below) to completely remove the unreacted oligonucleotide. This was necessary, since we found that in DNA relaxation and in vitro replication experiments involving competition between RepC* and wild-type RepC, the presence of free oligonucleotide and magnesium ions resulted in the conversion of RepC to RepC* and gave artifactual results that suggested that RepC* severely inhibited the RepC activity (data not shown). The extent of conversion of RepC to RepC* was determined by SDS-PAGE followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Typically, RepC* preparations contained no more than 5% of wild-type RepC. To recover RepC activity from RepC*, the RepC* preparation was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of an oligonucleotide (13-mer) representing the region immediately 5′ to the RepC nick site (nt 83–71) for 15 min at 32 °C in TEKEM buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10% ethylene glycol). The reaction product was then directly used to assay for the recovered RepC activities. Nicking-closing assays were done as described previously (7Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6845-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). One microgram of supercoiled pT181cop608 DNA was incubated with various amounts of the RepC or RepC* proteins at 32 °C for 30 min in TEKEM buffer, and the reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels using TBE (Tris borate-EDTA) buffer containing 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide. To study the inhibitory effect of RepC* on the relaxation activity of RepC, the proteins were mixed together prior to the addition of DNA. For nicking, 1 pmol of 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides (pT181 nt 83–60 containing the IRII and nt 75–60 representing the right arm and loop of IRII (Fig. 1) were incubated with 200 ng of the RepC or RepC* proteins for 30 min at 32 °C in TEKEM buffer in a reaction volume of 10 μl. For religation, reaction mixtures containing 600 ng of RepC* along with 1 pmol of labeled oligonucleotides representing the sequence immediately 5′ to the RepC nick site (pT181 nt 83–71 and 75–71; Fig. 1) were incubated for 15 min at 32 °C in TEKEM buffer. The above reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 μl of sequencing dye, and the products were resolved on 20% polyacrylamide-urea DNA sequencing gels (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binding of various proteins to the pT181 origin subregions was investigated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing various subregions of the pT181 origin were 5′-end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (31Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, the 53-bp oligonucleotide (pT181 positions 37–83) was used as the probe. Reaction mixtures (20 μl) containing the 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (2–5 pmol), 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% ethylene glycol, 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), and the indicated amounts of the initiator proteins were incubated at room temperature for 10 min and electrophoresed on native polyacrylamide gels using TBE buffer. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Plasmid DNAs were replicatedin vitro using S. aureus extracts as described earlier (16Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Rosenblum W.D. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8571-8577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Murray R.W. Koepsel R.R. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1051-1057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Replication reactions were carried out using 200 ng of pT181cop608 plasmid DNA, 600 μg of protein extract, and the indicated amounts of the RepC or RepC* proteins. The reaction products were labeled with [α-32]dATP and incubated for 60 min at 32 °C. DNA was recovered by treatment with proteinase K, phenol-chloroform extraction, and alcohol-precipitation, and the samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 0.7% agarose gels using TBE buffer containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Approximately 500 μg of RepC or 250 μg of RepC* proteins were loaded onto an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Superose 12 FPLC column (20 ml) that had been previously equilibrated with the RepC buffer. The column was eluted with 20 ml of the RepC buffer, and 0.5-ml fractions were collected. In a separate experiment, bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa) were used as molecular weight standards to generate a calibration curve. RepC protein was subjected to sedimentation in a 5–20% sucrose gradient (5 ml) in a SW50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 24 h at 4 °C. Ten micrograms each of bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrysinogen, and ribonuclease A along with 16.5 μg of RepC were used. Fractions (185 μl each) were collected from the bottom of the tubes and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fractions were also assayed for the topoisomerase activity of RepC as described above. To investigate the biochemical activities of the modified pT181 initiator protein, we generated RepC* in vitro. Treatment of an SS oligonucleotide (nt 75–60 of pT181, Fig. 1) containing the nick site with RepC generated a protein preparation that contained approximately 95% RepC* and less than 5% wild-type RepC as determined by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2). The above results suggested that if RepC exists as a dimer, both of its subunits must be competent in nicking of the DNA. Alternatively, RepC may exist as a monomer and can be converted to RepC* almost quantitatively at high concentrations of the oligonucleotide. Treatment of an SS oligonucleotide containing the complete IRII (nt 83–60; Fig. 1) with RepC generated a protein preparation that contained approximately 50% each RepC and RepC* (Fig. 2). To confirm that RepC* generated in vitro was “active,” we tested its religation activity utilizing SS oligonucleotides representing the region immediately 5′ to the RepC nick site (Fig. 1). This experiment showed that RepC* retained its religation activity, and while nt 83–71 ligated efficiently to RepC*, ligation of nt 75–71 was very poor (Fig. 3). This result is consistent with the observation that more RepC* was generated in the presence of nt 75 to 60 than with IRII (Fig. 2) due to the less efficient religation of the released oligonucleotide (nt 75–71) to RepC*. The RepC* preparation generated in vitro by the above procedure had an approximate molecular weight of 42,000 and is similar to that generated in vivo except that it contains less than 5% residual wild-type RepC as compared with a 1:1 mixture of RepC and RepC* forms isolated from pT181-containing cells (27Rasooly A. Wang P.-Z. Novick R.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5245-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The RepC* preparation generated in vitro was used to investigate the various biochemical activities of the modified initiator protein.Figure 3Religation activity of the RepC* protein. Purified RepC* protein was incubated with SS oligonucleotides representing the sequence immediately 5′ to the RepC nick site (nt 83–71 or nt 75–71), and the reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide-urea gel. Theasterisks indicate the positions of the regenerated IRII (nt 83–60) or the right arm and loop of IRII (nt 75–60) oligonucleotides by the religation activity of RepC*.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We investigated the DNA relaxation activity of RepC* using supercoiled (SC) pT181cop608 DNA as the substrate. While low levels of wild-type RepC efficiently relaxed the SC DNA, the RepC* preparation was essentially inactive (Fig. 4 A). The weak relaxation activity in the presence of high levels of RepC* may be due to the residual amounts of RepC present in the preparation. To further rule out the possibility that RepC* was inactivated during its preparationin vitro, we incubated RepC* with an oligonucleotide representing the region immediately 5′ to the RepC nick site (left arm and a portion of the loop of IRII, nt 83–71 in Fig. 1). This treatment was expected to result in the religation of the oligonucleotide attached to RepC* to the substrate oligonucleotide and the concomitant regeneration of wild-type RepC. RepC* treated in such a way was found to be active in DNA relaxation (Fig. 4 A). These results showed that RepC* was inactive in nicking-closing due to the attachment of the oligonucleotide to its active tyrosine residue. RepC* did not detectably inhibit the relaxation activity of wild-type RepC in competition experiments (Fig. 4 A). We also tested the cleavage of SS DNA by RepC*. As expected, while RepC efficiently cleaved the SS oligonucleotide (nt 75–60), RepC* had very low cleavage activity (Fig. 4 B). This low level activity of RepC* may be due to the residual levels of RepC present in the RepC* preparation. The above results indicate that RepC* is defective in SS DNA cleavage and DNA relaxation activities and does not significantly inhibit the relaxation activity of RepC. Since RepC* lacked DNA nicking-closing activity, it was expected to be inactive in replication. We wished to determine if this was the case and if RepC* played a regulatory role in DNA replication by inhibiting the activity of wild-type RepC. As shown in Fig. 5, wild-type RepC was active in in vitro replication even at low levels, while RepC* was totally inactive in replication. In competition experiments, RepC* inhibited the replication activity of wild-type RepC only to a limited extent (Fig. 5), with an approximately 2-fold inhibition at a 10:1 molar ratio of RepC* to RepC as determined by quantifying the radioactivity using an Ambis 100 radioanalytic detector. We have previously shown by footprinting studies that RepC binds to double-stranded pT181 origin DNA (nt 37–68) that includes IRIII and the right arm of IRII (8Koepsel R.R. Murray R.W. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5484-5488Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of RepC has also been shown to be critical for its replication activity (17Dempsey L.A. Birch P. Khan S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3083-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Dempsey L.A. Birch P. Khan S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24538-24543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We wished to determine whether RepC* generated in vitro is able to bind to the pT181 origin of replication. EMSA were carried out using the following four synthetic, double-stranded oligonucleotides representing the various subregions of the pT181 origin: a 53-bp DNA (containing pT181 nt 37–83; Fig. 1) that included both IRIII and IRII; a 46-bp fragment (pT181 nt 46–83); a 30-bp fragment containing only IRIII (pT181 nt 37–60); and a 26-bp fragment containing only IRII (pT181 nt 60–83). The sizes of the various oligonucleotides used were slightly larger than the respective pT181 sequence they contained due to the presence of linker sequences at their ends. With the 53- and 46-bp oligonucleotides and low levels of RepC, the C1 DNA-protein complex was present at much higher levels than the larger C2 complex, and the levels of the C2 complex increased substantially at higher levels of RepC (Fig. 6 A). Interestingly, only a single DNA-protein complex (C1) was observed, with the 30-bp region containing only the IRIII region even at high levels of RepC (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, only a single complex was observed with the 26-bp IRII region, although the levels of this complex were much lower than those seen with all the other origin regions (Fig. 6 A). It should be noted that while the sizes of the four DNA probes used were different, the C1 and C2 complexes migrated to the same position regardless of the probe used. This may be due to the small sizes of the probes used where the electrophoretic mobility was predominantly determined by the size, shape, and charge of the RepC protein. The above results suggested that two RepC-DNA complexes were formed at the origin, one due to the binding of RepC to IRIII, and the other upon binding to both the IRIII and IRII regions. The RepC* protein retained significant DNA binding activity as tested by EMSA using the 53-bp fragment as the probe (Fig. 6 B). Interestingly, in the presence of RepC* only the C1 complex was obtained even at high concentrations of the protein. The C1 complex observed with RepC* (RC*-C1) migrated slightly slower than the C1 complex observed with RepC, consistent with the fact that the molecular weight of monomeric form of RepC* is approximately 42,000 as compared with 38,000 for RepC (26Rasooly A. Novick R.P. Science. 1993; 262: 1048-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). RepC* competed with RepC for binding to the DNA to a limited extent when present at higher levels (Fig. 6 B). RepC* also generated a single complex with the 46-, 38-, and 23-bp oligonucleotides (data not shown). The above results showed that RepC* retains significant DNA binding activity and that while RepC is capable of oligomerization at the origin, RepC* is inactive in this function. We further investigated oligomerization of RepC and RepC* when bound to the DNA utilizing a MBP-RepC fusion. As seen with RepC, the MBP-RepC protein generated two DNA-protein complexes when the 53-bp oligonucleotide was used as the probe (Fig. 7). The binding of MBP-RepC to the DNA was weaker than that of unfused RepC, indicating that the epitope tag may interfere with the DNA binding activity of RepC to a moderate degree. The migration of the C1 and C2 complexes obtained with MBP-RepC (MBRC-C1 and MBRC-C2) was consistent with its monomeric molecular weight of 80,000, which is slightly more than twice that of wild-type RepC. When RepC and MBP-RepC were incubated together with the DNA, their respective C1 and C2 complexes were obtained (Fig. 7). Interestingly, a novel intermediate complex (IC) was also observed (Fig. 7). The position of the intermediate complex (between the MBRC-C1 and MBRC-C2 complexes) is consistent with it containing one molecule each of RepC and MBP-RepC, further suggesting that RepC may oligomerize on the DNA. Interestingly, very little or no intermediate complex was present when RepC* and MBP-RepC were incubated with the DNA (Fig. 7). The faint IC in these lanes may be due to the residual RepC present in the RepC* preparations. RepC* also inhibited the formation of the MBRC-2 comple"

Barbier G. Forterre P. Labedan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 144-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The enzyme putatively facilitates the formation of 6-phosphoryl-IMP by the nucleophilic attack of the 6-oxo group of IMP on γ-phosphate of GTP, and then the formation of adenylosuccinate by displacement of the 6-phosphoryl group by l-aspartate (11Lieberman I.

AMPSase from Escherichia coli is a monomer at physiological concentrations (1 μm), but dimerizes when nucleotide ligands are present (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol.

The dimer is probably the physiologically active form of the enzyme, having a K m corresponding to intracellular concentrations of IMP. The disordered active site of unligated AMPSase becomes ordered in the presence of substrates and substrate analogs (15Poland B.W Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y. Kim K.H. Harris E.M.S. Honzatko R.B. J.

The largest conformational change is a 9-Å movement of the loop 42–53 (40s loop), which folds against the guanine nucleotide. Loop 120–131 (120s loop), which interacts with IMP, and loop 299–303 (300s loop), which interacts primarily with analogs of l-aspartate in crystal structures, become ordered in the presence of ligands. The conformational changes above putatively exemplify induced fit, a concept introduced by Koshland some three decades ago (21Koshland Jr., D.E. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. I. Academic Press, New York1970: 341Google Scholar). The ligand-enzyme interactions, however, which contribute most (in terms of a thermodynamic driving force) to the observed conformational changes have yet to be identified, nor can we exclude the possibility of energy contributions from interactions between protein residues well removed from the active site. On the basis of ligated crystal structures of adenylosuccinate synthetase, Asp21, Asn38, Thr42, and Arg419 do not interact with atoms of substrates involved with the chemistry of phosphotransfer or nucleophilic attack by l-aspartate (17Poland B., W.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The backbone amide of Thr42 forms a hydrogen bond with the α-phosphoryl group of the guanine nucleotide, but its side chain forms only a weak hydrogen bond to that same α-phosphoryl group (20Poland B.W. Lee S. Subramanian M.V. Siehl D.L. Anderson R.J. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15753-15759Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Asn38 provides one of five hydrogen bonds to the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP; implicating Asn38 in the ground-state stabilization of the IMP-enzyme complex (17Poland B., W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 19Poland B.W. Bruns C. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15200-15205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mutations of Asn38 have little effect on theK m of IMP, but a major impact onk cat, mutations of Asp21 and Arg419 destabilize the transition state, and the mutation of Thr42 to alanine reduces affinities for all substrates. The effects of each of the mutations above can be understood in terms of their influence upon two interdependent, dynamic mechanisms in AMPsase: (i) ligand-induced reorganization of the active site and (ii) ligand-induced dimerization of the enzyme. The above mutations also illustrate the importance of a sound understanding of structure and dynamics of an enzyme before assigning functional roles to side chains. GTP, IMP, l-aspartate, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes were from Promega. Pfu DNA polymerase and E. coli strain XL-1 blue were obtained from Stratagene. E. coli strain H1238 (purA−) was a gift from Dr. D. Bachman (Genetic Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT). Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B came from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other reagents and chemicals came from Sigma if not otherwise specified. Owing to the undetectable levels of expression for some mutants using the PMS204 plasmid expression system, we used here a more efficient prokaryotic expression system, based on the pTrc99A vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the following primers to incorporate NcoI andPstI restriction sites at either end of the purAgene. TrcN:TrcC2:5′­GATGCCATGG¯GTAACAACGTCGTCG­3′(NcoI site underlined)5′­AACTGCAG¯TCTGCCAGGCGTACCACA­3′(PstI site underlined) The NcoI restriction site was incorporated into the N terminus of the purA gene, before the first Met codon (ATG), and the PstI restriction site was introduced after the stop codon. Pfu DNA polymerase was used in the polymerase chain reaction to ensure high fidelity amplification (Fig. 1). The amplified and subcloned purA gene containing the 1.3-kilobase pair fragment was sequenced twice in both directions using the chain termination method (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) at the Nucleic Acid Facility, Iowa State University. Sequence analysis showed 100% identity with theE. coli purA sequence deposited in GenBank™, except at position 415, a GAT (Asp) is replaced by GGT (Gly), which agrees with published crystal structures (15Poland B.W Silva M.M.

The purA gene was subcloned into the pTrc99A vector and the final construct, pTrpA, was transformed into E. coli strain H1238 (purA−) for overexpression of AMPSase. TheNcoI-PstI fragment containing purA was subcloned in to the pAlterEXII vector (Promega, Inc.). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out according to published procedures from Promega, Inc. The primers used in mutations were 5′-GTAAGATCGTCGCTCTTCTGACTGA-3′ (Asp21 → Ala), 5′-GGGCGGTCACGCTGCAGGCCATA-3′ (Asn38→ Ala), 5′-GGGCGGTCACGACGCAGGCCATA-3′ (Asn38→ Asp), 5′-GGGCGGTCACGAAGCAGGCCATA-3′ (Asn38 → Glu), 5′-CGCAGGCCATGCTCTCGTAATCAA-3′ (Thr42 → Ala), and 5′-CCGGATCTTACTGAAACCATG-3′ (Arg419 → Leu), where the underlined bases are mismatched with respect to the wild-typepurA sequence. The primer 5′-AACAACGTCGTCGTACTGGG-3′ was used to sequence the plasmids and confirm mutations for all but Arg419 → Leu, where the primer 5′-AACAGCCAAGCTTGCATGCC-3′ was used. All primers were synthesized on a Bioresearch 8570EX automated DNA synthesizer at the Nucleic Acid Facility at Iowa State University. After mutagenesis, the NcoI-PstI fragment containing the desired mutation was subcloned into pTrc99A and transformed into the E. coli strain H1238 (purA−) for expression. The wild-type and mutant enzymes were purified as described elsewhere (23Bass M.B. Fromm H.J. Stayton M.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 342-355Google Scholar, 24Kang C. Fromm H.J. Arch.

The enzyme was eluted from a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column by a series of buffered solutions, 0.6 m, 0.4 m, and 0.2m in (NH4)2SO4 and 50 mm in potassium Pi (pH 7.0). All the enzymes eluted at 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4. The enzyme fractions were concentrated and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium Pi (pH 7.0), then further purified using a DEAE-TSK high performance liquid chromatography column. Enzyme purity was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad) (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). All the mutant enzymes were subjected to circular dichroism analysis as described elsewhere (22Sanger F. Nicklen S.

From 1 to 500 μg/ml enzyme was used in kinetic assays, depending on the activity of each mutant. Absorbance changes at 290 nm and 25 °C were monitored with a GBC model 918 UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier-Effert temperature controller. MES and HEPES were chosen as buffers for the pH range 5.5–8.5, and acetate buffer was used at pH 5.2. Buffer concentrations were held at 20 mm for all assay solutions. Assay solutions contained 300 μm GTP, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mml-aspartate for the wild-type enzyme and 1.5 mmGTP, 7 mm MgCl2, 10 mml-aspartate for the Asn38 → Asp mutant enzyme. IMP concentrations varied from 25 to 750 μm for assays of the wild-type enzyme, and 25 μm to 10 mm for assays of the Asn38 → Asp mutant. 500 μg/ml of the Asn38 → Asp mutant and 1 μg/ml of wild-type AMPSase were used in assays. 2-mm quartz cuvettes were used to compensate for the high absorbance due IMP. Longer assay time (4 min) was used to compensate for the low activity of the Asn38 → Asp mutant. Wild-type, Asn38 → Asp, and Asn38 → Glu mutant AMPSases were analyzed by analytical equilibrium sedimentation ultracentrifugation, in the absence and in the presence of ligands (5 mm MgCl2, 30 μm IMP, 30 μm GTP, 1 μmhadacidin) at pH 7.7 and 5.6. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation experiments were performed as described previously (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), using hadacidin in place of aspartate. Enzyme concentrations were such that they gave an A 280 reading of 0.4. Monomer-dimer dissociation constants were determined as described previously (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J.

Positions corresponding to Asp21, Asn38, His41, Thr42, and Arg419 are almost 100% identical across species (Table I). In the absence of ligands, Asn38 has no specific interactions, but in the ligated synthetase it hydrogen-bonds with the 5′-phosphate of IMP (Fig. 2; Ref. 17Poland B., W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J.

Asp21 in the unligated synthetase hydrogen-bonds with His41, as noted above, but also makes a salt link with Arg419 in ligated complexes (17Poland B., W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol.

The CD spectra of Asp21 → Ala, Thr42 → Ala, Arg419 → Leu, and wild-type enzymes are identical from 200 to 260 nm, indicating the absence of conformational change because of mutation. The position 38 mutants showed small differences in their CD spectra relative to the wild-type spectrum (data not shown). The differences are probably a consequence of a perturbation in the conformation of the 40s loop and/or the monomer-dimer equilibrium of AMPsase (see below). TheK m values of the Asp21 → Ala, Asn38 → Ala, and Asn38 → Glu mutants are comparable to those of wild-type AMPSase (TableIII). Althoughk cat for the Thr42 → Ala mutant was the same as that of the wild-type enzyme, K mvalues showed 5–10-fold increases. The mutation of Asp21to alanine reduced k cat 20-fold and slightly increased KmGTP and KmIMP, whereas Arg419reduced k cat 10-fold, with a slight increase in Kmaspartate, and 8-fold increases in KmGTP and KmIMP. Asn38 → Ala, Asn38 → Asp, and Asn38 → Glu mutants showed 30–200-fold reductions in k catrelative to the wild-type enzyme. Of the three position Asn38 mutants, only Asn38 → Asp exhibited increased K m values (KmIMP increased 80-fold).Table IIIKinetic parameters of wild-type and mutant AMPSasesAMPSasepHk catK mGTPK mIMPK mASPk cat/K mGTPk cat/K mIMPk cat/K mASPs−1μmμmmms−1μm−1 × 10−3s−1μm−1 × 10−3s−1mm−1Wild-type7.71.00 ± 0.0526 ± 228 ± 10.23 ± 0.0438 ± 436 ± 34.4 ± 0.85.60.096 ± 0.00811 ± 170 ± 200.9 ± 0.29 ± 11.4 ± 0.40.11 ± 0.03Asp21 → Ala7.70.049 ± 0.00152 ± 548 ± 40.17 ± 0.010.95 ± 0.091.02 ± 0.080.30 ± 0.02Arg419 → Leu7.70.100 ± 0.002250 ± 20200 ± 100.34 ± 0.070.41 ± 0.030.49 ± 0.030.29 ± 0.06Asn38 → Ala7.70.0048 ± 0.000241 ± 549 ± 70.30 ± 0.020.12 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.010.016 ± 0.001Asn38 → Asp7.70.0134 ± 0.0003270 ± 201600 ± 4002.6 ± 0.40.051 ± 0.0040.008 ± 0.0020.0052 ± 0.00075.60.171 ± 0.008116 ± 103800 ± 4000.5 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.20.045 ± .0020.33 ± 0.09Asn38 → Glu7.70.034 ± 0.00154 ± 528 ± 10.24 ± 0.020.62 ± 0.061.22 ± 0.060.143 ± 0.01His41 → AsnaFrom Ref. 29.7.70.0095 ± 0.0001130 ± 10400 ± 82.0 ± 0.60.076 ± 0.0080.024 ± 0.0020.005 ± 0.002Thr42 → Ala7.70.890 ± 0.02280 ± 20123 ± 51.4 ± 0.13.2 ± 0.27.2 ± 0.30.65 ± 0.05a From Ref. 29McRorie D.D Voelker P.J.

Open table in a new tab Of the three position 38 mutants, onlyK m values for the Asn38 → Asp mutant show large increases. Altered kinetic parameters for the Asn38 → Asp mutant could originate from electrostatic repulsion between the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP and the side chain of Asp38. Protonation of the Asp38 side chain, or the 5′-phosphoryl group of IMP, then, could restorek cat and K m to wild-type levels. k cat versus pH profiles for the wild-type and the Asn38 → Asp enzymes are bell-shaped (Fig. 3). The optimum pH values for wild-type and Asn38 → Asp enzymes are 7.8 and 5.6, respectively. In fact, the Asn38 → Asp mutant had higher catalytic activity than the wild-type enzyme at pH 5.6 (Table III) and 5.2 (data not shown). Although wild-type levels of activity were recovered in the Asn38 → Asp mutant by dropping the pH, KmIMP remains 100-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. IMP induces dimerization of AMPsase monomers (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Kang C. Kim S. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29722-29728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the dimer arguably has 100-fold higher affinity for IMP than the monomer. Hence, we examined the Asn38 → Asp mutant by ultracentrifugation methods, in order to determine whether its elevated KmIMP originated from its properties of aggregation. In centrifugation studies reported here, the wild-type and Asn38 → Glu enzymes are controls, as each exhibits comparable K m values for IMP, and hence should be dimers in the presence of IMP. The monomer-dimer dissociation constants for the three enzymes in the absence and presence of ligands at pH 7.7 are in Table IV. At pH 5.6, the three enzymes precipitated during ultracentrifugation runs. The three AMPSases show similar K D values in the absence of ligands. In the presence of ligands, however, the K Dof the Asn38 → Asp mutant (252 μm) differs significantly from that of wild-type and Asn38 → Glu enzymes, both of which are vanishingly small (Table IV). Furthermore, the dissociation constant for Asn38 → Asp in the presence of ligands is 19 times higher than the dissociation constant for Asn38 → Asp in the absence of ligands.Table IVMonomer-dimer dissociation constants for wild-type and mutant AMPSasesAMPSaseAbsence of ligandsPresence of ligandsK DGoodness of fitaGoodness of fit determined by the chi-square test (29).K DGoodness of fitaGoodness of fit determined by the chi-square test (29).μmμmWild-type15 ± 20.00090 ± 0.000060.2287Asn38 → Asp14 ± 20.6014250 ± 701.130Asn38 → Glu24 ± 42.1870 ± 0.00053.278a Goodness of fit determined by the chi-square test (29McRorie D.D Voelker P.J.

Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Curr. Top. Cell Regul. 1983; 22: 103-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar),k cat represents the breakdown of the quarternary complex of enzyme and substrates to enzyme and products. Thus,k cat for AMPsase is sensitive to the energy changes in the transition state. Kinetic data indicate destabilization of the transition state for the Asp21 → Ala and Arg419 → Leu mutants (k cat falls 20- and 10-fold, respectively, relative to the wild-type enzyme). Thus, the Asp21-Arg419 salt link must stabilize the transition state. As the hydrogen bond between Asp21 and Arg419 is about 13 Å from the bound Mg2+(approximate center of catalysis), the stabilization is necessarily a result of an indirect mechanism. The loss of the Asp21-Arg419 salt link could destabilize interactions between the 40s and 400s loop. Indeed, in the unligated enzyme Arg419 is disordered (15Poland B.W Silva M.M. Serra M.A. Cho Y.

Biol. 1995; 254: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and the 40s and 400s loop do not interact. In the ligated enzyme, backbone carbonyl 417 hydrogen-bonds with a water molecule, which in turn hydrogen-bonds to backbone carbonyl 42 and the 2′-OH of GDP (17Poland B., W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An alternative mechanism by which the loss of the Asp21-Arg419 salt link could influence the transition state is by way of a small perturbation of the P-loop (residues 8–16). Asp13 is a putative catalytic base (17Poland B., W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar,28Kang C. Sun N. Poland B.W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A displacement of its side chain by perhaps as little as 0.5 Å could lead to complete inactivation of the synthetase. The interaction of Asp21 with Arg419 could stabilize the position of helix H1, which lies on the C-terminal side of the P-loop. Mutations in the P-loop have only modest effects on KmGTP and no effect on theK m for other substrates (28Kang C. Sun N. Poland B.W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11881-11885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), consistent with the lack of change in K m values for the Asp21 → Ala mutant. The mutation of Arg419 to leucine has a minor effect on theK m values for IMP and GTP. The increased KmGTP must be a result of a localized change in the 400s loop as the Asp21 mutation has no effect on K m values. The mutation of Arg419 could perturb the stacking of Pro417with the guanine base and hence lead to the increase in KmGTP. Given the observed binding synergism of IMP and GTP (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), a reduced GTP interaction should weaken IMP binding. The side chain of Thr42 binds weakly (at best) to the α-phosphoryl group of GTP, yet it is a conserved residue and its mutation to alanine increases K m values by approximately 10-fold. The above phenomenon may be a consequence of the 40s loop, which is in an equilibrium between two conformational states. The “open” conformer predominates in the absence of ligands, whereas the “closed” conformer appears when ligands are bound to the active site. The absence of an appreciable effect onk cat caused by the mutation of Thr42to alanine implies no significant perturbation of the 40s loop in the ligated conformation of the synthetase. If however, the mutation to alanine stabilizes the open conformation of the loop, then ligands must spend a greater fraction of their binding energy to drive the 40s loop to its closed conformation. That the K m values increase for all substrates is a reflection of synergism in substrate binding (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Asn38 → Ala and Asn38 → Glu have no influence on K m values but reducek cat by 200- and 30-fold, respectively. Evidently, the interaction between Asn38 and the 5′-phosphate of IMP does not enhance the affinity of IMP for the active site. Instead, the binding energy probably is diverted completely to the stabilization of the transition state. Asn38 belongs to a short element (residues 38–41) that immediately precedes the 40s loop. Within this structural element, the peptide link between residues 40 and 41 undergoes a significant change in conformation (17Poland B., W. Fromm H.J. Honzatko R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1013-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the α-carbon and side-chain of Asn38 move toward the 5′-phosphate by 1 Å. These small conformational adjustments preceding the 40s loop are probably coupled to the 9-Å movement of the loop itself. Hence, the energy of interaction of Asn38 with the 5′-phosphate of IMP may go to support the conformational change in the 40s loop. The mutation of Asn38 to aspartate presents a far more complex phenomenon. The introduction of a negative charge at position 38 probably elevates KmIMP by charge repulsion. All of the allowable conformations of Asp38 bring its side chain close to the 5′-phosphate of IMP. (In contrast, allowable conformations of Glu38 are possible, which bring about significant separation of the 5′-phosphate and the side chain.) By protonation of Asp38 and/or the 5′-phosphate of IMP, a hydrogen bond is possible in the Asn38 → Asp mutant. Thus, k cat for the mutant at pH 5.6 is restored to wild-type levels, possibly because IMP can again drive the required conformational change in the 40s loop. K m values for the Asn38 → Asp mutant are not restored to wild-type levels at low pH, however, suggesting that a pH-independent mechanism is responsible for the elevatedK m values of the mutant. The wild-type enzyme is predominantly a monomer in the absence of ligands at concentrations used in assays (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IMP induces dimerization of the wild-type enzyme at pH 7.7, its interaction with Arg143 of a second monomer being essential in stabilizing the dimer. The mutation of Arg143 to leucine or lysine does not influencek cat, but increases KmIMP 100-fold at pH 7.7, and concomitantly abolishes ligand-induced dimerization at low concentrations of IMP and enzyme (13Wang W. Gorrell A. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7078-7084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The high KmIMP values for the Asn38 → Asp mutant at pH 7.7 then may reflect the weak interaction of IMP with the mutant as a monomer, rather than the binding of IMP to a mutant dimer. This is supported by the monomer-dimer dissociation constants for Asn38 → Asp with and without ligands. The higher dissociation constant for the Asn38 → Asp in the presence relative to the absence of ligands shows that Asn38 → Asp favors a dimeric state in the absence of ligands. At pH 5.6, IMP may bind to the active site of the mutant as a monoanion, allowing formation of the hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp38. However, the monoanionic state of IMP may not stabilize sufficiently its interaction with Arg143 of a second subunit. Hence, the affinity for IMP remains low, because the mutant remains a monomer at low pH. The wild-type enzyme, on the other hand, selects the dianion state of IMP from solution at low pH and, as a consequence, dimerizes. Hence, the KmIMP for wild-type enzyme at pH 5.6 reflects the interaction of IMP with a synthetase dimer. AMPsase is rife with ligand-induced changes, which in a broad perspective influence subunit dimerization and/or reorganization of its active site. As a consequence of the coupling of ligand-binding energy to dynamic processes that influence the conformation of loci remote from the active site, residues can bind directly to substrates and have no effect on binding affinity as measured by K m and residues remote from the active site can have substantial effects on the stability of the transition state or the binding affinity of substrates. Such phenomena underscore the pitfalls in using site directed mutations alone in assigning residues to the active site of an enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2154175620,"Alternative RNA processing of the human fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 transcript results in receptor forms that vary in their affinity for fibroblast growth factor. An alternative RNA processing event involving recognition of the α-exon is deregulated during neoplastic transformation of glial cells. We have previously established a splicing reporter/transfection cell culture model system to identify sequences involved in recognition of this exon. In this study, the system was used to identify two sequence elements that differentially function to regulate splicing of this exon. Exclusion of the α-exon in glioblastoma cells specifically required the downstream intron sequence comprising the 5′-splice site. Replacement or mutation of this sequence increasing complementarity to U1 RNA resulted in enhanced exon recognition in SNB-19 glioblastoma cells. Sequences within the exon were found to be required for α-exon inclusion. Deletion and gain-of-function experiments identified a 69-nucleotide exon sequence that was specifically required for α-exon inclusion. These studies indicate that multiple sequences are required for the regulated recognition of the α-exon."

Others have shown that c-Mos phosphorylation at Ser-3 (equivalent to Ser-34 in v-Mos) is important for the interaction of c-Mos with its substrate MEK and for its stability and cytostatic factor activity in eggs. To investigate the role of Ser-56 phosphorylation, we generated site-directed mutants of v-Mos that would mimic phosphorylation in terms of charge at positions 56 and 34. After mutating serine (S) residues with alanine (A) or glutamic acid (E) in different combinations, various v-Mos mutants were expressed in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system and in COS-1 or NIH/3T3 cells. The effect of mutations on Mos function was evaluated by in vitro protein kinase assays and by the ability of Mos to cause neoplastic transformation of NIH/3T3 cells. The S56E but not the S56A mutation inhibited v-Mos kinase activity suggesting that Ser-56 phosphorylation has an inhibitory role. As predicted from Xenopus c-Mos studies, S34A but not S34E mutation inhibited v-Mos activity. Studies with the double mutants showed that the S56E mutation but not S56A mutation inhibited v-Mos kinase activity of both S34A and S34E mutants. Interestingly, the S56A mutation blocked the inhibitory effect of the S34A mutation on v-Mos kinase suggesting that in c-Mos the corresponding serine (Ser-25) can influence the regulation of c-Mos by Ser-3. Results showing inhibition of v-Mos kinase activity of the S34E mutant by the S56E mutation is significant as it suggests that doubly phosphorylated Mos at these residues would be inactive. Because residues corresponding to both v-Mos Ser-34 and Ser-56 are evolutionarily conserved in c-Mos, the kinase activity of c-Mos during meiosis may also be regulated in the same manner as v-Mos kinase activity.

Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1997: 251-259Google Scholar). In addition to the catalytic domain, c-Mos contains 65 amino acids at the amino terminus, which are present in the v-Mos protein without any amino acid substitutions (1van Beveren C. van Straaten F. Galleshaw J.A. Verma I.M. Cell. 1981; 27: 97-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 25Bold R.J. Donoghue D.J. Mol. Cell.

The amino-terminal sequences play an important part in the regulation of kinase activity and stability of the Mos protein. Xenopus Mos is degraded by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, signals for which reside in the amino-terminal sequences. c-Mos ubiquitination (at lysine 34) requires Pro-2 and an unphosphorylated Ser-3 (27Nishizawa M. Furuno N. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4021-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 28Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2433-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at Ser-3 by autophosphorylation and possibly by additional, unidentified Ser-3 kinase or kinases contributes to the stabilization (via inhibition of ubiquitination) as well as activation of c-Mos kinase. Ser-3 phosphorylation also enhances the ability of Mos to interact with its substrate MEK by a mechanism not understood at present (29Chen M. Cooper J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In a previous study designed to understand the mechanisms of inhibition of Mos by the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), we identified v-Mos residue Ser-56 as the major site of phosphorylationin vivo (30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ser-56 is phosphorylated by PKA efficientlyin vitro. Co-expression of the recombinant catalytic subunit of PKA as well as treatment of cells with forskolin, an activator of adenyl cyclase, causes an increase in v-Mos phosphorylation at Ser-56. Residues corresponding to v-Mos Ser-56 and Arg-53 are evolutionarily conserved in c-Mos from frog to man, which makes the corresponding serine in c-Mos (Ser-25) a potential target for phosphorylation by PKA. However, we also found that forskolin treatment inhibited an Ala-56 mutant of v-Mos (termed S56A) by phosphorylation at Ser-263 present in the catalytic domain although the S56A mutant was inhibited less than wild-type v-Mos (30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, based on these results the functional significance of phosphorylation at Ser-56 is not well understood. In this report, we studied the role of phosphorylation of v-Mos residues Ser-56 by site-directed mutagenesis. Our results provide strong evidence that a negative charge at position 56 inhibits v-Mos kinase activity. We also investigated the role of phosphorylation of v-Mos residue Ser-34 (equivalent to c-Mos Ser-3) in the regulation of v-Mos kinase. We did not detect Ser-34 phosphorylation possibly because it occurs only in M-phase. However, mutations at position 34 of v-Mos affected v-Mos activity similar to the way the mutations at position 3 affect Xenopus c-Mos activity. The S34A mutation but not the S34E mutation inhibited v-Mos kinase activity. Therefore, we also examined the effect of mutations at position 56 in combination with mutations at position 34. Overall, our results suggest that activation of c-Mos by phosphorylation of Ser-3 during oocyte maturation would also require the lack of phosphorylation of Ser-25. The v-mosgene of Moloney murine sarcoma virus strain 124 and its mutants were cloned into the XhoI site of pJC119 expression vector (31Hannink M. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7894-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Before mutagenesis, the entire v-mos gene was cloned into pBluescript II SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers containing appropriate base substitutions. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. His-Mos expression construct was prepared by first cloning a v-mos sequence encoding amino acids 32–374 into theXhoI site of pEBVHis C (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) by polymerase chain reaction. Then, a NcoI-HindIII fragment encoding His-Mos was excised from the pEBVHis c-mosvector and cloned into the XhoI site of pJC119 by blunt-end ligation. Various Mos mutants were cloned by excising wild-typemos sequences from pJC119-His-Mos and inserting theXhoI mos fragments encoding the mutations. The His-Mos protein contains 39 amino acids added at the amino terminus of v-Mos(32–374). These include (His)6 and an enterokinase cleavage site. The sequences immediately adjacent to Mos are N-Ile-Arg-Pro-Arg-Gly-C. Plasmids were transfected into COS-1 cells by the DEAE-dextran method as described (31Hannink M. Donoghue D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7894-7898Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For stable expression in NIH/3T3 cells, cotransfection with the pKJ1 neo vector (32Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) was carried out using LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Methods for metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine or [32P]orthophosphate, immunoprecipitation, Western immunoblotting, protein kinase assays involving autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation of MEK1, and tryptic phosphopeptide mapping have been described previously (2Maxwell S.A. Arlinghaus R.B. Virology. 1985; 143: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 15Pham C.D. Arlinghaus R.B. Zheng C.-F. Guan K.-L. Singh B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1683-1688PubMed Google Scholar,30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For in vitro translation of v-Mos mutants, the pBluescript-v-mos plasmids were linearized, and capped RNAs were synthesized using a Cap-Scribe kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Nonradioactive or [35S]cysteine-labeled v-Mos was synthesized in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitation of the relative amount of radioactivity in protein bands was carried out by scanning densitometry of bands on x-ray films or by scintillation counting of excised gel slices. The transforming activity of Mos mutants was assayed by analyzing the ability of stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells to form colonies in soft agar by the standard procedure. Cells (1 × 104) were seeded in 9.6-cm2 wells of 6-well plates in triplicate. After incubation at 37 °C for 14 days, colonies were stained with 0.1%p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline (0.6 ml/well) overnight. Then, the excess dye solution was removed, and the colonies were photographed. This study was designed to understand the role of Ser-56 and its phosphorylation in the regulation of v-Mos kinase activity. Phosphorylation of Ser-3 of c-Mos (equivalent to Ser-34 of v-Mos) is known to be important for Mos kinase activity. Here, we provide evidence that a negative charge at position 56 inhibits v-Mos kinase activity and that Ser-56 is required for the inhibitory effect of the S34A mutation on v-Mos kinase to occur. To investigate the possibility that a functional interaction may occur between Ser-34 and Ser-56 in regulating v-Mos function, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to substitute serine residues with alanine at Ser-34, Ser-56, or both. The mutants so produced were named S34A, S56A, and S34A/S56A, respectively. Based upon the “second codon rule” governing c-Mos degradation, the stabilizing effect of Ser-3 phosphorylation is strictly dependent upon its position with reference to the amino terminus (28Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2433-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the stimulation of c-Mos kinase activity and Mos-MEK interaction by a negative charge at position 3 of c-Mos can also be observed when using recombinant Mos proteins that have extra sequences at the NH2 terminus (e.g. MBP-Mos and LexA-Mos) (29Chen M. Cooper J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, v-Mos contains an extra 31 amino acids at the amino terminus of c-Mos. v-Mos residue 2 is Ala and residue 3 is Arg or His in v-Mos encoded by the HT1 or 124 strains of Moloney murine sarcoma virus, respectively. Thus, by analogy with Xenopus c-Mos, a negative charge at position 34 of v-Mos may enhance v-Mos kinase activity and Mos-MEK interaction but may not affect v-Mos stability. v-Mos and its mutants were expressed in COS-1 cells using a vector containing the SV40 late promoter. After transfection, cell extracts were analyzed at 48 h for autokinase activity using immune complexes prepared with anti-v-Mos(37–55) antibodies (Fig. 1 A). We chose to assay Mos activity by an autokinase assay, because it is most sensitive and faithfully reflects the ability of Mos to phosphorylate its substrate MEK (Ref. 30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, see below). As expected from previous c-Mos studies, the S34A mutant of v-Mos had low kinase activity (less than 10% of the wild-type, compare lanes 1 and 3). The S56A mutant had kinase activity comparable with wild-type v-Mos (lanes 1 and 5). Surprisingly, the S34A/S56A double mutant and the S56A mutant exhibited similar kinase activity (lanes 5and 7), suggesting that v-Mos must contain serine or serine phosphate at position 56 for the inhibitory effect of the S34A mutation to be observed. To determine the relative levels of various mutant Mos proteins and their ability to be immunoprecipitated by the antibodies used in kinase assay, we carried out Western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation. v-Mos and its mutants S34A, S56A, or S34A/S56A were expressed in COS-1 cells. After the transfected COS-1 cells were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine for 2 h, the v-Mos protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, when compared with the wild-type v-Mos, the S34A mutant migrated faster during SDS-PAGE. In contrast, the double mutant S34A/S56A comigrated with the S56A. This may indicate that the S34A mutation is unable to induce a conformational change in the S56A mutant as it does in the wild-type v-Mos. Western immunoblotting and radioimmunoprecipitation results indicated that the protein level of the S34A mutant was 3–5-fold lower than that of the wild-type v-Mos (Fig. 1, B and C). However, this mutation lowered v-Mos protein kinase activity more dramatically (20-fold) indicating the importance of a serine at this position for the catalytic function. It is possible that phosphorylation affects v-Mos activity differently in transiently transfected COS-1 cells and stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells. Transiently transfected cells contain a higher level of v-Mos per cell than stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells, resulting in cytotoxicity (33Papkoff J. Verma I.M. Hunter T. Cell. 1982; 29: 417-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, to address this question, stably transfected NIH/3T3 cells expressing v-Mos and its mutants (S34A, S56A, or S34A/S56A) were established. The autokinase activity (Fig. 2 A) and protein levels (Fig. 2 B) of v-Mos and its mutants were analyzed as in Fig. 1. The results obtained were similar to those for transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Examination of the protein kinase activity of various v-Mos mutants and their protein levels suggests that the S34A mutation inhibited v-Mos activity in both COS-1 and NIH/3T3 cells. On the other hand, the S56A mutation did not inhibit the kinase activity of v-Mos (Figs. 1 and 2). One concern about our results was the use of one particular antibody in the immune complex protein kinase assays. This is a valid concern because the antigen epitope in v-Mos is in the vicinity of the phosphorylation sites being investigated. The antigen-binding sites of our anti-Mos(37–55) antibody are completely blocked by v-Mos peptides 42–53 or 44–55 but not blocked by v-Mos peptide 37–48. 2N. K. Herzog, B. Singh, and R. B. Arlinghaus, unpublished observations. Thus, the major antigenic epitope or epitopes for this anti-peptide antibody lie between v-Mos amino acids 44 and 53. To address this concern, a 39-amino acid long sequence from the pEBV-His C vector (Invitrogen) that includes (His)6 was fused to v-Mos amino acids 32–374 (equivalent to the entire c-Mos). The His-Mos fusion protein was expressed in COS-1 cells using the SV40 late promoter. Mos autokinase assay was carried out using immune complexes prepared with antibodies against either a sequence outside Mos (Omni-probe antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, which is directed against specific vector sequences mapping between the polyhistidine tag and Mos insert sequences) (Fig. 3 A) or v-Mos residues 37–55 (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained using immune complexes prepared with Omni-probe antibody and the anti-Mos(37–55) antibody, suggesting that the results in Figs. 1 and 2were not because of the use of a particular anti-Mos antibody. Equally important, the results were similar to those shown in Fig. 1, suggesting that the mutant phenotype is not dependent upon the presence of the unique 31 amino acids amino-terminal sequence in v-Mos, which is absent in c-Mos. Next, the effect of S56A mutation on the activity of v-Mos containing residues 32–374 was examined. Similar to the results obtained using v-Mos and His-v-Mos(32–374) (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3), the S34A mutation inhibited v-Mos(32–374) but not its S56A mutant. v-Mos(32–374) is similar to c-Mos in terms of size and enzyme activity. 3Y. Yang, C. D. Pham, V. Vuyyuru, and B. Singh, unpublished observations. Furthermore,in vitro autophosphorylation patterns of v-Mos(32–374) and c-Mos are identical as are the in vivo phosphorylation patterns of His-v-Mos(32–374) and His-c-Mos.3 Overall, these results suggest that Ser-56 has a similar role in the regulation of both v-Mos and c-Mos. The mechanism by which Ser-56 influences the outcome of the S34A mutation is not understood at present. To understand the role of Ser-56 phosphorylation, we asked whether a negative charge at position 56 would influence v-Mos protein kinase activity. The S56E mutant of v-Mos was generated and expressed in COS-1 cells and in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system. To determine the relative specific activity of v-Mos kinase, v-Mos protein was quantitated by Western blotting (in case of COS-1 cells) and incorporation of [35S]cysteine during in vitro translation. In both systems, the S56E mutation caused a significant inhibition (more than 90%) of v-Mos protein kinase activity (Fig. 4). To provide further evidence of the inhibitory role of Ser-56 phosphorylation, we employed two strategies to increase PKA activity, addition of purified PKA catalytic subunit to in vitrotranslated v-Mos and forskolin treatment of transfected COS-1 cells (Fig. 5). Both types of treatment inhibited v-Mos kinase as expected from previous studies (30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast to wild-type v-Mos, the S56A and S56E mutants were not significantly inhibited by treatments that increase PKA activity. Although an increase in PKA activity also causes some additional minor changes in the phosphorylation of v-Mos (30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), these results are consistent with an inhibitory role of Ser-56 phosphorylation because PKA requires the presence of Ser-56 to execute its inhibitory effects. To determine the consequences of having different combinations of charge at positions 34 and 56 of v-Mos, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to substitute Ser-34 and Ser-56 with alanine or glutamic acid in different combinations. Alanine and glutamic acid have been shown to mimic unphosphorylated and phosphorylated serine, respectively, to varying degrees in numerous proteins. Various v-Mos mutants were expressed in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte translation system (Fig. 6) and in vivo transiently in COS-1 cells or stably in NIH/3T3 cells (Fig. 7). The protein kinase activity of v-Mos mutants was determined by measuring autophosphorylation (Figs. 6 and 7) and transphosphorylation of its substrate MEK1 (Fig. 6). As expected from previous results (30Yang Y. Herrmann C.H. Arlinghaus R.B. Singh B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 800-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), v-Mos autokinase activity correlated with the ability of v-Mos to phosphorylate its substrate MEK1. The relative level of v-Mos protein was determined by measuring [35S]cysteine incorporation (Fig. 6 B) or by Western blotting (Fig. 7 B). Relative specific activity of v-Mos kinase was calculated from the radioactivity measurements of bands in Figs. 4 and 6 (Table I). The mutations affected v-Mos kinase activity similarly in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and in vivo in COS-1 and NIH/3T3 cells (compare Figs. 6 and 7).Figure 7Effect of various v-Mos mutations on Mos kinase from transfected COS-1 and NIH/3T3 cells. Various v-Mos mutants were expressed by transient transfection in COS-1 cells (A and B) or by stable transfection in NIH/3T3 cells (C). Autokinase assays (A and C) and Western immunoblotting (B) were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A faint background band seen on Western blotting (panel B, lane 1) is not Mos related as it was also detected with the peptide-blocked antibody (data not shown).

Activity in the 1% range could not be detected; we are assigning a <1% activity value to S34A/S56E and S34E/S56E double mutants based on the assay of transforming activity. As expected from the Xenopus c-Mos studies (28Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Furuno N. Watanabe N. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2433-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 29Chen M. Cooper J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4727-4734Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), activity of the S34E mutant was comparable with that of wild-type v-Mos. The S56E mutation inhibited v-Mos kinase irrespective of the residues at position 34; v-Mos containing either Ser, Ala, or Glu was inhibited by a Glu at position 56 (Figs. 6 and 7). The inhibitory effect of the negative charge at position 56 was dominant over the stimulation effect of the negative charge at position 34. These results suggest that phosphorylation of v-Mos at Ser-56 would render v-Mos incompetent for activation without or with phosphorylation of Ser-34. In contrast to the inhibition by the S56E mutation, the S56A mutation not only did not affect the kinase activity of WT v-Mos, but it also interfered with the ability of the S34A mutant to inhibit v-Mos kinase as described above (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3). For some unknown reason, the S56A mutation inhibited activity of the S34E mutant by about 50%. One significant point emerged from the Western blot data shown in Fig. 7 B. There were some reproducible differences in the steady-state protein levels of various Mos mutants. The S34A mutation caused a reduction, and the S34E mutation caused an increase in the amount of v-Mos protein. Although we have not carried out detailed pulse-chase analysis to determine the half-lives of various mutant Mos proteins, these preliminary data indicate that a negative charge at position 34 may stabilize v-Mo"
