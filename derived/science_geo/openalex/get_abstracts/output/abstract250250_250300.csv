The tree has its basis in a concatenation of 31 orthologs occurring in 191 species with sequenced genomes. It revealed interdomain discrepancies in taxonomic classification. Systematic detection and subsequent exclusion of products of horizontal gene transfer increased phylogenetic resolution, allowing us to confirm accepted relationships and resolve disputed and preliminary classifications. For example, we place the phylum Acidobacteria as a sister group of δ-Proteobacteria, support a Gram-positive origin of Bacteria, and suggest a thermophilic last universal common ancestor."

We demonstrate a giant electrocaloric effect (0.48 kelvin per volt) in 350-nanometer PbZr 0.95 Ti 0.05 O 3 films near the ferroelectric Curie temperature of 222°C. A large electrocaloric effect may find application in electrical refrigeration."
https://openalex.org/W1997288094,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common form of irreversible blindness in developed countries1,2. Variants in the factor H gene (CFH, also known as HF1), which encodes a major inhibitor of the alternative complement pathway, are associated with the risk for developing AMD3,4,5,6,7,8. Here we test the hypothesis that variation in genes encoding other regulatory proteins of the same pathway is associated with AMD. We screened factor B (BF) and complement component 2 (C2) genes, located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region, for genetic variation in two independent cohorts comprising ∼900 individuals with AMD and ∼400 matched controls. Haplotype analyses identify a statistically significant common risk haplotype (H1) and two protective haplotypes. The L9H variant of BF and the E318D variant of C2 (H10), as well as a variant in intron 10 of C2 and the R32Q variant of BF (H7), confer a significantly reduced risk of AMD (odds ratio = 0.45 and 0.36, respectively). Combined analysis of the C2 and BF haplotypes and CFH variants shows that variation in the two loci can predict the clinical outcome in 74% of the affected individuals and 56% of the controls. These data expand and refine our understanding of the genetic risk for AMD."

We have evaluated a recently synthesized platinum nitride (PtN) that was shown to have a large bulk modulus, and we propose a structure that is isostructural with pyrite and has the stoichiometry PtN 2 . We have also synthesized a recoverable nitride of iridium under nearly the same conditions of pressure and temperature as PtN 2 . Although it has the same stoichiometry, it exhibits much lower structural symmetry. Preliminary results suggest that the bulk modulus of this material is also very large."
https://openalex.org/W2127401672,"Humans collaborate with non-kin in special ways, but the evolutionary foundations of these collaborative skills remain unclear. We presented chimpanzees with collaboration problems in which they had to decide when to recruit a partner and which potential partner to recruit. In an initial study, individuals recruited a collaborator only when solving the problem required collaboration. In a second study, individuals recruited the more effective of two partners on the basis of their experience with each of them on a previous day. Therefore, recognizing when collaboration is necessary and determining who is the best collaborative partner are skills shared by both chimpanzees and humans, so such skills may have been present in their common ancestor before humans evolved their own complex forms of collaboration."

However, little is presently known about the role of DJ-1 in the more common sporadic form of PD and in other age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease (AD). Here we report that DJ-1 is oxidatively damaged in the brains of patients with idiopathic PD and AD. By using a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we have identified 10 different DJ-1 isoforms, of which the acidic isoforms (pI 5.5 and 5.7) of DJ-1 monomer and the basic isoforms (pI 8.0 and 8.4) of SDS-resistant DJ-1 dimer are selectively accumulated in PD and AD frontal cortex tissues compared with age-matched controls. Quantitative Western blot analysis shows that the total level of DJ-1 protein is significantly increased in PD and AD brains. Mass spectrometry analyses reveal that DJ-1 is not only susceptible to cysteine oxidation but also to previously unsuspected methionine oxidation. Furthermore, we show that DJ-1 protein is irreversibly oxidized by carbonylation as well as by methionine oxidation to methionine sulfone in PD and AD. Our study provides new insights into the oxidative modifications of DJ-1 and indicates association of oxidative damage to DJ-1 with sporadic PD and AD.

Alzheimer disease (AD) 2The abbreviations used are: AD, Alzheimer disease; PD, Parkinson disease; DNP, 2,4-dinitrophenyl; ROS, reactive oxygen species; MALDI-TOF/MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MALDI-TOF/TOF/MS/MS, MALDI-TOF tandem mass spectrometry; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ESI/MS/MS, electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. and Parkinson disease (PD) are the two most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the selective loss of neurons in specific brain regions and the deposition of misfolded proteins into aggregates or inclusions, such as neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques in AD and Lewy bodies in PD (1Ross C.A. Poirier M.A. Nat. Med. 2004; 10 (suppl.): 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). The majority of AD and PD cases are sporadic with hereditary familial cases accounting for less than 10% (2Cordato D.J. Chan D.K. J. Clin.

The genetic defects underlying several monogenic familial forms of AD and PD have recently been identified (3Pardo L.M. van Duijn C.M. Mutat. Res. 2005; 592: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the causes of other AD and PD cases, particularly sporadic cases, remain unclear. Increasing evidence indicates that oxidative stress plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic AD and PD (4Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (Suppl. 3): 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 5Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 6Beal M.F.

For example, both AD and PD have been associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could result from a combination of aging, genetic predisposition, and environmental factors (6Beal M.F. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 797-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Epidemiological studies suggest that exposure to pesticides, herbicides, and other environmental toxins that inhibit mitochondrial complex I can lead to excess production of ROS and increased incidence of sporadic PD (8Jenner P. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 245-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, post-mortem analyses reveal that the overall levels of oxidative damage to proteins, lipids, and DNA are elevated in AD and PD brains (4Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (Suppl. 3): 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 9Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The most widely used marker for oxidative damage to proteins is the presence of carbonyl groups, which can be introduced into proteins by direct oxidation of Pro, Arg, Lys, or Thr side chains or by Michael addition reactions of Cys, His, or Lys residues with products of lipid peroxidation or glycooxidation (5Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 10Dalle-Donne I. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Rossi R. Milzani A. Trends Mol.

Elevation in the total level of protein carbonyls has been documented in both AD and PD (4Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (Suppl. 3): 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 9Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Although it was initially thought that targets of oxidative damage by reactive oxygen species were random and indiscriminate, it has become increasingly clear that the susceptibility of proteins to oxidative damage is highly dependent on specific properties of individual proteins, such as unique sequence motifs, surface accessibility, protein folding, and subcellular localization (10Dalle-Donne I. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Rossi R. Milzani A. Trends Mol. Med. 2003; 9: 169-176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 11Nystrom T.

The identities of the oxidatively damaged proteins in AD and PD that have been modified by carbonylation or other types of oxidation remain largely unknown. Mutations in DJ-1 has recently been linked to an autosomal recessive, early onset familial form of PD (13Bonifati V. Rizzu P. van Baren M.J. Schaap O. Breedveld G.J. Krieger E. Dekker M.C.

Interestingly, previous studies have shown that DJ-1 is rarely present in Lewy bodies in PD (29Rizzu P. Hinkle D.A. Zhukareva V. Bonifati V. Severijnen L.A. Martinez D. Ravid R. Kamphorst W.

However, DJ-1 has been found to colocalize with α-synuclein-immunoreactive glial inclusions in multiple system atrophy and with a subset of pathological tau inclusions in a number of neurodegenerative tauopathies, including AD (29Rizzu P.

The observed oxidative damage to DJ-1 may have important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of sporadic PD and AD. Human Brain Samples—Brain tissues were obtained from the Emory Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Brain Bank. For biochemical studies, frontal cortex tissues from five PD cases, five AD cases, and five healthy non-demented control subjects were used (Table 1). The neuropathological diagnosis of PD was based on the presence of nigral degeneration and Lewy bodies. The neuropathological diagnosis of AD was made using Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer Disease criteria (31Mirra S.S. Heyman A. McKeel D. Sumi S.M. Crain B.J. Brownlee L.M. Vogel F.S.

The protein level and the carbonyl level of each DJ-1 isoform in PD, AD, and controls were quantified using the two-dimensional gel analysis program PD Quest (Bio-Rad). Statistical comparison of the data obtained from five PD, five AD, and five control individuals were performed using analysis of variance. Significant difference was accepted at p < 0.05. Mass Spectrometry—Spots of interest were excised from the gels and digested in situ with trypsin (modified; Promega) or Lys-C (Sigma-Aldrich). The Lys-C digests were derivatized with ProteoMass Guanidination kit (Sigma-Aldrich) to increase the mass spectral signal intensities of C-terminal lysine-containing peptides (34Beardsley R.L.

Assignment of the MS/MS fragments was verified by comparison with the predicted ions generated in silico by GPMAW (Lighthouse Data). Accumulation of Acidic Isoforms of DJ-1 Monomer and Basic Isoforms of DJ-1 Dimer in PD and AD Brains—To investigate whether the expression and/or posttranslational modification(s) of DJ-1 is altered in sporadic PD and AD, we performed comparative high resolution, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis experiments on frontal cortex homogenates obtained from idiopathic PD and AD and age-matched controls. The frontal cortex was chosen because of tissue availability and its relevance to the pathology of both AD and PD. In AD the frontal cortex exhibits neuronal loss and is rich in neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques. In PD, although neuronal loss mainly occurs in the substantia nigra, the frontal cortex contains Lewy bodies, the pathological hall-mark of PD. Analysis of DJ-1 expression and modifications in the substantia nigra or striatum might provide more PD-relevant information. Unfortunately, we had difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of these tissues for biochemical analyses. Although DJ-1 exists as a homodimeric protein, DJ-1 migrates on SDS polyacrylamide gels as a 20-kDa monomer because of denaturation by SDS (17Olzmann J.A. Brown K. Wilkinson K.D. Rees H.D. Huai Q. Ke H. Levey A.I. Li L. Chin L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8506-8515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 29Rizzu P. Hinkle D.A. Zhukareva V. Bonifati V.

Immunoblot analysis of the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels with anti-DJ-1 antibody revealed the presence of at least six distinct isoforms of DJ-1 monomer that have the same apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa but different isoelectric points (5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 6.1, and 6.4, respectively; Fig. 1, A and B). The predominant form of DJ-1 is the 20-kDa/pI 6.4 isoform, which is in good agreement with the predicted values of 19.9 kDa/pI 6.3 for DJ-1 monomer. Of the 6 identified DJ-1 monomer isoforms, the acidic isoforms (pI 5.5 and 5.7) of DJ-1 monomer were selectively accumulated in PD and AD compared with control brains (Fig. 1, B and C). The accumulation of these acidic DJ-1 isoforms is likely due to specific modifications of DJ-1 in PD and AD instead of nonspecific changes in DJ-1 occurring post-mortem because within each of the PD, AD, and control group, the relative levels of acidic DJ-1 isoforms (pI 5.5 and 5.7) were similar among samples with different post-mortem intervals (Fig. 1F). Besides DJ-1 monomeric forms, we observed at least four different isoforms of SDS-resistant DJ-1 dimer that migrated on the two-dimensional SDS-PAGE gels with an apparent molecular mass of 39 kDa and pI values of 7.0, 7.4, 8.0, and 8.4, respectively (Fig. 1, A and D). Interestingly, a previous study reported the presence of SDS-resistant DJ-1 dimers in the detergent-insoluble fraction of brains from patients with multiple system atrophy (30Neumann M. Muller V. Gorner K. Kretzschmar H.A. Haass C. Kahle P.J. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl). 2004; 107: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). To determine whether the accumulation of SDS-resistant dimeric DJ-1 is related to PD and AD, we compared the levels of DJ-1 dimeric forms in PD, AD, and age-matched control brains. The results showed that the levels of the basic isoforms (pI 8.0 and 8.4) of DJ-1 dimer were significantly increased in PD and AD brains compared with controls (Fig. 1, D and E). In addition to the monomeric and dimeric forms of DJ-1, weak DJ-1-immunoreactive spots at about 30 kDa were occasionally observed in the control as well as in PD and AD brain samples (Fig. 1A). These 30-kDa DJ-1 spots might represent modified forms of DJ-1 that have undergone some types of post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation or mono-ubiquitination. Of note, the mono-ubiquitinated form of recombinant DJ-1 protein with similar apparent molecular mass (∼30 kDa) has been shown to exist in transfected SH-SY5Y cells (35Moore D.J. Zhang L. Troncoso J. Lee M.K. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 71-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a 27-kDa DJ-1 species of unknown modification has been reported in the detergent-insoluble fraction of brains from patients with Pick's disease as well as of AD brains (30Neumann M. Muller V. Gorner K. Kretzschmar H.A. Haass C. Kahle P.J. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl). 2004; 107: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, despite repeated attempts, we were unable to further characterize these 30-kDa DJ-1 species due to their extremely low abundance and the variability of their appearance from sample to sample. The Total Level of DJ-1 Protein Is Increased in PD and AD Brains—Our two-dimensional immunoblotting data (Fig. 1) suggest that the total level of DJ-1 isoforms may be increased in PD and AD brains. To further investigate this possibility, we performed quantitative Western blot analysis using protein samples obtained from PD and AD brains and age-matched controls. The fact that all six DJ-1 monomer isoforms have the same molecular mass of 20 kDa and all four DJ-1 dimer isoforms are of 39 kDa (Fig. 1) allowed us to use one-dimensional gel electrophoresis for direct comparison of the total DJ-1 levels of various brain samples on the same gel. After electrophoresis the gels were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies against DJ-1 and actin (Fig. 2A). Because the amount of protein extract (50 μg of protein/lane) loaded on one-dimensional gels were much less than the amount (350 μg of protein/gel) on two-dimensional gels, only a single DJ-1 band of 20 kDa was detected on the one-dimensional gels. The relative level of DJ-1 in each sample was measured by quantification of the intensity of 20-kDa DJ-1 band and normalized to the actin level in the corresponding sample. The results revealed a significant increase in the total level of DJ-1 in PD and AD brains compared with the controls (Fig. 2B). DJ-1 Protein Is Oxidatively Damaged in PD and AD Brains—Protein carbonylation is an irreversible oxidation that has been widely used as a biomarker of severe oxidative damage to proteins (5Levine R.L. Stadtman E.R. Exp. Gerontol. 2001; 36: 1495-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 10Dalle-Donne I. Giustarini D. Colombo R. Rossi R. Milzani A. Trends Mol.

Ample evidence indicates that the total level of protein carbonyls is increased in both AD and PD (4Jenner P. Ann. Neurol. 2003; 53 (Suppl. 3): 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar, 9Giasson B.I. Ischiropoulos H. Lee V.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 32: 1264-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). It has recently become clear that only a small subset of total brain proteins in PD and AD is carbonylated (32Choi J. Levey A.I.

However, the identities of these oxidatively damaged proteins are largely unknown. Furthermore, it remains to be determined whether the protein targets of oxidative damage are the same or are different in AD and PD. To determine whether DJ-1 protein is oxidatively damaged in PD or AD brain, we used a well established assay to detect protein carbonyl groups by derivatization of the carbonyls with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine and subsequent immuno-detection of the resulting hydrazones using anti-DNP antibodies (32Choi J.

Protein extracts from PD, AD, and control brains were resolved by isoelectric focusing on an immobilized pH-gradient strip followed by in-strip DNP derivatization of protein carbonyls and second-dimensional separation by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-DJ-1 and anti-DNP antibodies (Fig. 3). We found that among the six identified monomeric forms of DJ-1, only the 20-kDa/pI 6.4 isoform was oxidatively modified, as evidenced by the significant increase in protein carbonyl content of this isoform in PD and AD brains (Fig. 3A). Of the four dimeric forms of DJ-1, three isoforms (39 kDa/pI 7.4, 39 kDa/8.0, and 39 kDa/pI 8.4) were found to exhibit elevated oxidative modification by carbonylation in PD and AD brains (Fig. 3B). No DNP immunoreactivity was observed in the controls where the primary anti-DNP antibody or the DNP derivatization procedure was omitted (data not shown), confirming the specificity of our observations. The lack of detection of carbonyls in the more acidic forms of DJ-1 monomers (pI 5.5–6.1) could mean that these isoforms represent un-carbonylated forms of DJ-1 or could be due to their lower abundance compared with the pI 6.4 DJ-1 isoform, making them undetectable because they might fall below the detection threshold required for anti-DNP immunoblotting. We favor the first interpretation, because the levels of these un-carbonylated DJ-1 monomeric forms were much higher than the dimeric forms of DJ-1 (pI 7.4–8.4) (Fig. 1A), which have been shown to be carbonylated by anti-DNP immunoblotting in the same experiments (Fig. 3B). To quantitatively determine the differences in protein oxidation between the disease brains and the controls, we quantified the protein level and the carbonyl level of each DJ-1 isoform in five PD, five AD, and five control cases and obtained the specific oxidation index by normalization of the intensity of carbonyl level to the intensity of protein level for each DJ-1 isoform. Statistic analysis of the results showed a significant increase in the specific oxidation levels of the pI 6.4 monomeric and the dimeric forms (pI 7.4–8.4) of DJ-1 in PD as well as in AD compared with the age-matched control brains (Table 2).TABLE 2Specific oxidation index of DJ-1 isoforms in PD, AD, and control brainsDJ-1 isoform (Mr/pI)ControlPDADn = 5n = 5n = 520/pI 6.40.30 ± 0.031.17 ± 0.23ap < 0.05.1.07 ± 0.30ap < 0.05.39/pI 7.40.43 ± 0.061.93 ± 0.50ap < 0.05.2.06 ± 0.06ap < 0.05.39/pI 8.00.73 ± 0.171.63 ± 0.26ap < 0.05.1.67 ± 0.30ap < 0.05.39/pI 8.40.97 ± 0.134.00 ± 0.40ap < 0.05.3.66 ± 0.60ap < 0.05.a p < 0.05.

This nonlinear response of drainage to rainfall will most seriously affect regions in the intermediate, unstable regime. A 10% decrease in precipitation in regions on the upper regime boundary (1000 millimeters per year) would reduce drainage by 17%, whereas in regions receiving 500 millimeters per year, such a drop would cut 50% of surface drainage. By using predicted precipitation changes, we calculate that a decrease in perennial drainage will significantly affect present surface water access across 25% of Africa by the end of this century."

We have calculated a 4.5 angstrom–resolution x-ray crystallographic map of porcine fatty acid synthase, highly homologous to the human multienzyme, and placed homologous template structures of all individual catalytic domains responsible for the cyclic elongation of fatty acid chains into the electron density. The positioning of domains reveals the complex architecture of the multienzyme forming an intertwined dimer with two lateral semicircular reaction chambers, each containing a full set of catalytic domains required for fatty acid elongation. Large distances between active sites and conformational differences between the reaction chambers demonstrate that mobility of the acyl carrier protein and general flexibility of the multienzyme must accompany handover of the reaction intermediates during the reaction cycle."

Here, we show, by using direct patchclamp recordings from presynaptic hippocampal mossy fiber boutons, that axons transmit analog signals in addition to action potentials. Excitatory presynaptic potentials result from subthreshold dendritic synaptic inputs, which propagate several hundreds of micrometers along the axon and modulate action potential–evoked transmitter release at the mossy fiber–CA3 synapse. This combined analog and action potential coding represents an additional mechanism for information transmission in a major hippocampal pathway."

The huge assembly contains two separated reaction chambers, each equipped with three sets of active sites separated by distances up to ∼130 angstroms, across which acyl carrier protein shuttles substrates during the reaction cycle. Regions of the electron density arising from well-defined structural features outside the catalytic domains separate the two reaction chambers and serve as a matrix in which domains carrying the various active sites are embedded.

https://openalex.org/W2018212873,"The actin-nucleation factors Spire and Cappuccino (Capu) regulate the onset of ooplasmic streaming in Drosophila melanogaster. Although this streaming event is microtubule-based, actin assembly is required for its timing. It is not understood how the interaction of microtubules and microfilaments is mediated in this context. Here, we demonstrate that Capu and Spire have microtubule and microfilament crosslinking activity. The spire locus encodes several distinct protein isoforms (SpireA, SpireC and SpireD). SpireD was recently shown to nucleate actin, but the activity of the other isoforms has not been addressed. We find that SpireD does not have crosslinking activity, whereas SpireC is a potent crosslinker. We show that SpireD binds to Capu and inhibits F-actin/microtubule crosslinking, and activated Rho1 abolishes this inhibition, establishing a mechanistic basis for the regulation of Capu and Spire activity. We propose that Rho1, cappuccino and spire are elements of a conserved developmental cassette that is capable of directly mediating crosstalk between microtubules and microfilaments."

Ceramide has been suggested to play important roles in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, inflammation, and the eukaryotic stress response (1Gulbins E. Kolesnick R.

Although ceramide can be generated by de novo synthesis through ceramide synthase, for the majority of cellular responses, it is generated from SM by the action of neutral or acid SMases. Different SMases have been described in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and are distinguished by their subcellular localization, pH optima, and requirement for metal ions. Three mammalian SMases have been molecularly cloned. The best characterized of these enzymes is the acid SMase (SMPD1) that is predominantly located in lysosomes but also secreted in response to different ligand-receptor interactions at the cell surface (5Schuchman E.H.

The availability of two cDNAs encoding neutral sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase-2 and -3 (SMPD2 and -3) has allowed their biochemical and functional characterization. The ubiquitously expressed nSMase1 is Mg2+-dependent, localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and is reversibly inhibited by oxidized glutathione and reactive oxygen species. Recently, it has been shown that nSMase1 has phospholipase C activity toward specific lysophospholipids (9Sawai H. Domae N. Nagan N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38131-38139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Using an antisense strategy, Tonetti et al. (10Tonnetti L. Veri M.C. Bonvini E. D'Adamio L. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1581-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) have shown that nSMAse1 could be involved in ceramide-mediated apoptosis triggered by T cell receptor ligation. However, gene-targeted mice deficient for nSMase1 do not show any overt functional phenotype and no accumulation or changed metabolism of SM or other lipids (11Zumbansen M. Stoffel W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3633-3638Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, although some insights into the properties of nSMase1 have been provided, its functional significance remains elusive.NSMase2 is expressed predominantly in brain colocalizing with a Golgi marker in neuronal cells (8Hofmann K. Tomiuk S. Wolff G. Stoffel W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5895-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). NSMase2 has a neutral pH optimum, depends on Mg2+ ions, and is activated by unsaturated fatty acids and phosphatidylserine (PS). Biochemical characterization of nSMase2 overexpressed in yeast cells lacking inositol phosphosphingolipid phospholipase (Isc1p) reveals that nSMase2 is a structural gene for nSMase that acts as a bona fide nSMase in cells (12Sawai H.

Stable overexpression of nSMase2 in MCF7 cells results in a markedly decreased growth rate at the late exponential phase, suggesting that nSMase2 is involved in the regulation of cell growth (13Marchesini N.

These authors have also observed immature architecture and delayed ossification of long bones. Strikingly, positional cloning of the recessive mutation fragilitas ossium (fro) in mice identified a deletion in the gene encoding nSMase2 (Smpd3) that led to complete loss of enzymatic activity (15Aubin I.

The sequence of the resulting plasmids were confirmed by sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into yeast JK9-3dΔIsc1p cells as described by Marchesini et al. (13Marchesini N. Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13775-13783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the expression of nSMase3 was induced by incubating the cells in synthetic complete uracil medium containing 2% galactose overnight.Preparation of Lysates of Yeast Cells—Yeast cells were suspended in buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 4 μg/ml each of chymostatin, leupeptin, anti-pain, and pepstatin A. Cells were disrupted with glass beads as described previously (12Sawai H. Okamoto Y. Luberto C. Mao C. Bielawska A. Domae N. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39793-39798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The glass beads and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain the microsomal and cytosolic fractions. For the studies on cation and lipid effects and substrate requirements of nSMase2, membranes were delipidated by incubation in lysis buffer in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The suspension was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and the supernatant was used for enzymatic determinations. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay reagent.Overexpression of nSMase3 in Mammalian Cells—The open reading frame (ORF) of human nSMase3 (and nSMase2) was amplified by PCR using nSMase primers containing XhoI/EcoRI restriction sites. To obtain a stably expressing MCF7 cell line, full-length nSMase3 subcloned into the pRK vector was transfected into MCF7 cells using the Ca2+-phosphate precipitation method (18Sambrook J. Russel D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York2001Google Scholar). For the selection of stable transfectants, 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) was added to the medium. Independent colonies were picked and cultured in separate wells, and three clones from single cells expressing the highest nSMase activity in vitro were used as nSMase3 overexpressors. To determine the subcellular localization of nSMase3, three pcDNA3 expression vectors encoding HA-tagged nSMase were generated. The HA tag (YPYDVPDYA) was either added by PCR at the 5′ or at the 3′ end of the nSMase3 (pnSMase3HA5 or pSMase3HA3). Alternatively, the HA tag was inserted internally, that is, at nucleotide position 1233 (amino acid 411) of the nSMase3 ORF (pnSMase3HAi) by the PCR overlap extension procedure (19Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar). Briefly, the HA sequence (5′-TACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT-3′) was introduced into the nSMase ORF by the use of mutagenic forward and reverse oligonucleotides that prime downstream (1233-1253 ORF) and upstream (1213-1233) of the insertion site, respectively. Primers contained an overlapping complementary 5′ extension (HA sequence) to generate two DNA fragments having overlapping ends. These fragments were combined in a subsequent “fusion” PCR reaction in which the overlapping ends annealed, allowing the 3′ overlap of each strand to serve as a primer for the 3′ extension of the complementary strand. The resulting fusion product was amplified further by PCR and cloned into the multicloning site (EcoRI/XhoI) of the pcDNA3 expression vector. HA-tagged nSMAse3 was detected by affinity-purified polyclonal rabbit anti-HA antibody (eBioscience) and visualized by Alexa-488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen).Assay for Phosphodiesterase Activity of Neutral SMase toward SM and Other Phospholipids—The micellar SMase assay using exogenous radiolabeled SM was described by Wiegmann et al. (20Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). To measure phosphodiesterase activity of neutral SMase, pellets were dissolved in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 2mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mm Na2MoO4,30mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 750 μm ATP, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, and 0.5% Chaps. After 15 min at 4 °C, cells were homogenized by repeated squeezing of the cells through an 18-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by a low speed centrifugation (800 × g). The protein concentration in supernatants containing the cytosolic and membrane fractions was measured using a protein assay (Pierce, Hamburg, Germany). 50 μg of protein were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 1 mm MgCl2 (pH 7.4) and 2.25 μ l of [N-methyl-14C]SM. For specificity controls, the substrates used were PE, PS, PC, or LysoPAF. All radiolabeled substrates were obtained from Amersham Biosciences, Braunschweig, Germany. Phosphorylcholine was then extracted with 800 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1 v/v) and 250 μl of H2O. Radioactive phosphorylcholine produced from [14C]SM was quantified by counting 200 μl of the aqueous phase by scintillation counting.To measure phosphodiesterase activity toward LysoPAF, the reaction mixture was incubated with 0.59 pmol of [3H]lysoPAF diluted 100-fold with non-radioactive lysoPAF (Biomol). After 60 min of incubation at 37 °C, lysoPAF was extracted by the Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar) method and separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in a solvent containing chloroform/methanol/2 n NH4OH (60:35:5, v/v/v). The bands corresponding to the lysoPAF standard were scraped from the TLC plate for liquid scintillation counting.Sphingomyelin Measurement—Cells were seeded at 0.3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish in 8 ml of complete growth medium. The next day, the cells were labeled with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (1 μCi/ml final concentration in 10 ml of growth medium/plate) for 48 h. The cells were then chased with 10 ml of complete medium. At the indicated time points, the medium from each plate was collected, and the cells were washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold PBS. The cells were scraped off on ice in 2 ml of PBS, and each plate was washed with an additional 2 ml of PBS. Cells and washes were pooled with the medium and centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 × g (4 °C). Lipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer (21Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42174) Google Scholar) method, and aliquots of 250 μl were used for phosphorous and SM determination as previously described (20Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar).Detection of Ceramide—The generation of the neutral lipid cleavage product of SMases, ceramide, was detected by the diacylglycerol-kinase assay combined with TLC analysis. Briefly, MCF7 cells were washed two times in ice-cold PBS. Pellets were resuspended in 1.825 ml of H2O, and the supernatants were transferred into glass tubes. Subsequently, 6 ml of CHCl3/MeOH/1 n HCl (100/100/1 v/v/v) were added. Tubes were sonicated for 5 min in a water bath sonicator and then centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 × g. The lower organic phase was dried down under nitrogen. The dry samples were resuspended in 2 ml of 0.1 n KOH and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C (alkaline hydrolysis). 6 ml of CHCl3/MeOH/1 n HCl (100/100/1 v/v/v), 1 ml of CHCl3, and 2.25 ml of H2O were added. After vortexing, the samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 6000 × g. The lower organic phase was dried down under nitrogen and resuspended in 100 μl of CHCl3 followed by transfer into Eppendorf tubes. From this point, the diacylglycerol-kinase assay kit protocol was followed according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For thin layer chromatography, plates were pre-run in a solvent system composed of methanol/chloroform (1:1). The plates were removed from the tank and air-dried. The TLC chambers were pre-equilibrate for 1 h at room temperature with the solvent system cloroform:methanol:acidic acid (65:15:5,v/v/v). Dried samples were resuspend in 20 μl of chloroform:methanol (95:5, v/v). Samples were streaked onto a 10 × 10 cm silica gel thin layer plate. The plates were placed in a paper-lined TLC developing tank, and the solvent was allowed to migrate to the top of the plate. The plates were removed from the tank, air-dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR films at room temperature.Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and transfected with 1 μg of pnSMase3-HAc using ExGen 500 in vitro transfection reagent (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and incubated for 24 h. The cells were washed twice with cold PBS and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% sodium azide, 0,2% teleostean gelatin, and 0.1% saponin in PBS for 30 min. For immunostaining, cells were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-HA tag (eBioscience), rat anti-KDEL (carboxyl-terminal ER retention tetrapeptide) (kindly provided by Dr. J. C. Howard, Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany), or mouse anti-p230 antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories), washed with 0.1% saponin in PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rat Ig as a secondary reagent. The Golgi apparatus was stained by TRITC-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33258 and examined using a confocal fluorescence microscope.RESULTSIdentification of a Human Homolog to Bovine nSMase—We have previously reported the purification to homogeneity and biochemical characterization of a Mg2+-dependent nSMase from bovine brain (16Bernardo K. Krut O. Wiegmann K. Kreder D. Micheli M. Schäfer R. Sickman A. Schmidt W.E. Schröder J.M. Meyer H.E. Sandhoff K. Krönke M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7641-7647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequencing of tryptic peptides of bovine nSMase showed no homologies to any known nSMases. Allowing for mismatches due to possible species-specific primary sequences, extensive sequence data base searches revealed a homology to the human hypothetical protein FLJ20297 (synonyms KIAA1418 and LOC55627; GenBank™ accession number BAA92656). The predicted mRNA contains an ORF that encodes a protein of 866 amino acids resulting in a predicted molecular mass of 97.8 kDa, which matches the molecular mass of the nSMase previously purified from bovine brain. An alignment of the novel nSMase3 with nSMases1 and -2 is shown in Fig. 1A. Apparently, nSMase3 lacks an N-terminal signal peptide. In addition, a C-terminal hydrophobic region (amino acids 828-850) representing a putative transmembrane (TM) domain is followed by only 16 amino acid residues. The lack of an N-terminal leader sequence combined with a hydrophobic TM domain close to the C terminus defines the group of tail-anchored integral membrane proteins (22Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The precise location of the entire functional N-terminal portion of nSMase3 cannot be unequivocally deduced, because according to the specific algorithm applied, one to three TM regions can be identified. We employed different prediction algorithms based on analysis hydrophobicity profiles (Toppred2) (23von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar), multiple sequence alignment analysis (TMAP, TMpred) (24Persson B. Argos P. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), bias of amino acids in the TM domains (DAS) (25Cserzo M. Wallin E. Simon I. von Heijne G. Elofsson A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 673-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or hidden Markov's models (TMHMM) (26Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8882) Google Scholar). All of the algorithms predicted with a high probability the existence of at least one TM domain near to the C terminus. The total number of predicted TM regions differ from one (TMHMM) to two (DAS) or even four (Toppred2, TMpred). Thus, although integral membrane association of nSMase3 can be readily predicted, the exact number of TM regions is uncertain. Other than that, no statistically significant patterns or motifs were recognized. Strikingly, the alignment with mammalian nSMases1 and -2 showed no apparent homologies. The data base search revealed proteins closely related to nSMase3 in mouse, dog, chicken, zebrafish, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 1Comparison of the sequence of nSMase3 with functional analogs and homologous proteins. A, the deduced amino acid sequence of nSMase3 was aligned with nSMase1 and nSMase2 (GenBank™ accession numbers NP_003071 and NP_061137, respectively). Positions of amino acids are numbered on the left. Gray shaded boxes indicate identical or similar amino acids, and highly conserved amino acids are shaded in black. The solid-lined frame indicates the putative TM domain, and the dashed frame indicates the match with bovine peptide sequences. B, proteins with significant amino acid sequence homology were identified by a BLAST search of the GenBank™ data base. If more than one sequence from the same species were identified, sequences with the highest degrees of similarity were preferred. The sequence of nSMase3 was aligned with deduced amino acid sequences of homologous proteins from dog (GenBank™ accession number XP_543560), mouse (BAB31737), chicken (XP_415236), zebrafish (XP_706729), Drosophila (NP_650124), and C. elegans (NP_492324) using the ClustalW algorithm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The gene for nSMase3 is encoded on chromosome 2, chromosomal locus 2q21.1. Although the predicted gene comprises ∼31 alternative exons and may result in 12 different splice variants, we found that nSMase3 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed as a single 4.6 kb mRNA species, with the exception of leukocytes where two signals were visible. The greatest abundance of nSMase3 mRNA was observed in striated muscle and heart muscle (Fig. 2). It should be noted that the current version of the GenBank™ data base defines two shorter isoforms of FLJ20297 mRNA as a reference sequence. This reflects alternate splicing events that were hypothesized to occur on theoretical grounds and should result in mRNAs with 3,600 and 3,300 nucleotides, respectively. The 4.6 kb size of nSMase3 mRNA, however, suggests abundant expression of full-length cDNA corresponding to the cDNA clone with GenBank™ accession number AB037839.FIGURE 2Expression of nSMase3 mRNA in human tissues. Poly(A)+ mRNA from different human tissues (Clontech, human 12-lane multiple tissue Northern blot) was analyzed by Northern blotting using as a hybridization probe a randomly primed 32P-labeled full-length nSMase3 cDNA.View Large Image"
https://openalex.org/W1967943182,"The restoration of catalytic activity to mutant enzymes by small molecules is well established for in vitro systems. Here, we show that the protein tyrosine kinase Src arginine-388→alanine (R388A) mutant can be rescued in live cells with the use of the small molecule imidazole. Cellular rescue of a viral Src homolog was rapid and reversible and conferred predicted oncogenic properties. Using chemical rescue in combination with mass spectrometry, we confirmed six known Src kinase substrates and identified several new protein targets. Chemical rescue data suggest that cellular Src is active under basal conditions. Rescue of R388A cellular Src provided insights into the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. This chemical rescue approach will likely have many applications in cell signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2095699041,"Interferons (IFNs) are antiviral cytokines that selectively regulate gene expression through several signaling pathways including nuclear factor κB(NFκB). To investigate the specific role of NFκB in IFN signaling, we performed gene expression profiling after IFN treatment of embryonic fibroblasts derived from normal mice or mice with targeted deletion of NFκB p50 and p65 genes. Interestingly, several antiviral and immunomodulatory genes were induced higher by IFN in NFκB knock-out cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that NFκB was basally bound to the promoters of these genes, while IFN treatment resulted in the recruitment of STAT1 and STAT2 to these promoters. However, in NFκB knock-out cells IFN induced STAT binding as well as the binding of the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) to the IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) promoters. IRF1 binding closely correlated with enhanced gene induction. Moreover, NFκB suppressed both antiviral and immunomodulatory actions of IFN against influenza virus. Our results identify a novel negative regulatory role of NFκB in IFN-induced gene expression and biological activities and suggest that modulating NFκB activity may provide a new avenue for enhancing the therapeutic effectiveness of IFN.

Type I IFNs 2The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; ISG, IFN-stimulated gene; JAK, Janus kinase; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription; IRF, IFN regulatory factor; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; RT, real-time; WT, wild-type; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; MHC, major histocompatibility complex; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; IL, interleukin; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB. (IFNα, IFNβ, IFNω, and IFNτ) are multifunctional cytokines that are critical in the host defense to infectious agents by modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. IFNs induce their biological effects by regulating the expression of a family of early response genes, called IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), through JAK-mediated tyrosine-phosphorylation of the STAT factors, STAT1 and STAT2. The phosphorylated STAT proteins dimerize, translocate into the nucleus, and bind to the conserved IFN-stimulus response element (ISRE) within the promoters of ISGs (1Darnell J.E.J. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). In addition, transcription factors of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family have been shown to regulate ISG expression (2Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that IFNs also activate the nuclear factor κB (NFκB) transcription factor in a serine/threonine kinase-dependent signaling pathway (3Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13631-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol.

The mammalian NFκB proteins, p50, p52, RelA (p65), RelB, and c-Rel, form homodimers and heterodimers to regulate the expression of genes involved in the immune response, inflammation and cell survival (5Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). In most cell types, the predominant form of NFκB, the p50:p65 heterodimer, is bound to IκB inhibitory proteins in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells. Similar to various other stimuli, IFNα/β activates a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, which results in the dissociation of the inactive cytosolic NFκB·IκB complexes followed by NFκB nuclear translocation and DNA binding (3Yang C.H. Murti A. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13631-13636Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 4Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13756-13761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from mice with germ line deletions of the p50 and p65 genes were resistant to IFN-induced NFκB activation and were sensitized to the antiviral action of IFNβ against vesicular stomatitis virus (6Pfeffer L.M.

The present study was undertaken to further define the role of NFκB in IFN-induced gene expression and the biological actions of IFN. Gene expression profiling identified 35 ISGs whose induction was highly regulated by NFκB. A subset of genes that were induced higher by IFN in NFκB knock-out (NFκB-KO) cells encoded GTP-binding and antigen presentation proteins, which play critical roles in the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of IFN, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that these ISGs were induced more rapidly and at significantly lower IFN concentrations in NFκB-KO cells relative to wild-type (WT) MEFs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that NFκB dimers containing p50 and p65 were basally bound to the promoters of these ISGs. IFN induced the binding of STAT1 and STAT2 to these promoters. However, the kinetics of ISG induction in NFκB-KO MEFs by IFN correlated with the promoter binding of IRF1. These results suggest that IFN induction of these genes is negatively regulated by NFκB. We also found that NFκB suppressed not only the direct antiviral action of IFN against influenza virus but also IFN-induced influenza-specific MHC class I antigen presentation. Together, our results suggest that NFκB not only regulates the induction of a subset of IFN-induced genes but also the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of IFN. Biological Reagents and Cell Culture—Recombinant rat IFNβ was obtained from Biogen-Idec, Inc. (7Arduini R.M. Li Z. Rapoza A. Gronke R. Hess D.M. Wen D. Miatkowski K. Coots C. Kaffashan A. Viseux N. Delaney J. Domon B. Young C.N. Boynton R. Chen L.L. Chen L. Betzenhauser M. Miller S. Gill A. Pepinsky R.B. Hochman P.S. Baker D.P. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 229-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against the following proteins were used: p65, p50, IRF1, STAT1, STAT2, Tap1, and β-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); Mx1 was from Dr. Otto Haller; phospho-Stat2 was from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA); and TFIIB was from ActiveMotif (Carlsbad, CA). WT and NFκB-KO MEFs (8Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar) were plated at 1 × 104 cells/cm2 every 3 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% defined bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), and 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RNA Preparation and Microarray Analysis—Total cellular RNA from control and IFNβ-treated (2,500 units/ml for 5 h) WT or NFκB-KO MEFs was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of RNA was submitted to Genome Explorations Inc. (Memphis, TN) for labeling and hybridization to murine U74Av2 GeneChips (Affymetrix Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Expression values were determined using Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software. All data analysis was performed using GeneSpring software 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Inc.). The MAS 5.0 gene expression values for each gene were normalized as described previously (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fold induction by IFN was calculated in matched pairs of WT and NFκB-KO MEFs, respectively. The average of fold induction from three independent sets of GeneChip data for both WT and NFκB-KO MEFs was subjected to non-parametric t test. The difference of fold induction for each gene by IFN was calculated by subtracting fold induction in WT MEFs from fold induction in NFκB-KO MEFs. Quantitative Real-time (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from untreated and IFNβ-treated MEFs using TRIzol reagent. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on a SmartCycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA) using the AccessQuick™ RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI) and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The following forward and reverse primers were used for each gene: Ifi47, 5′-CTCGGACGGTTCTTCTTATC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGCACCCTCCTCTCTTCATG-3′ (reverse); Tap1, 5′-TTGCCTGAACAAGAACAGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AAGTTCCCCCTTGATGTCTG-3′ (reverse); Mx1,5′-GACTACCACTGAGATGACCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCTATTTCCTCCCCAAATG-3′ (reverse); β-actin, 5′-AAGGAGATTACTGCTCTGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGAC-3′ (reverse). Reverse transcription was performed at 48 °C for 45 min, and RT-PCR cycling parameters were as follows: denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, amplification at 94 °C for 30 s, and 62 °C for 30 s for 35 cycles. The product size was initially monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis and melting curves were analyzed to control for specificity of PCR reactions. The data on IFN-induced genes was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene β-actin. The relative units were calculated from a standard curve, plotting three different concentrations against the PCR cycle number at the cycle threshold (with a 10-fold increment equivalent to ∼3.1 cycles). Immunoblotting—At various times after IFNβ treatment (1,000 units/ml), MEFs were lysed directly in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (whole cell lysate), or nuclear extracts were prepared with the NE-PER kit (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, immunoblotted for Tap1, Mx1, β-actin, or TFIIB and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP experiments were performed using the ChIP-ITTM chromatin immunoprecipitation kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA was sheared to an average size of ∼600 bp. The following forward and reverse primers were used for each gene: Ifi47,5′-CATCTCTTTCATCCTTGTCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAAGCCTGGAAGATTCAAG-3′ (reverse); Tap1, 5′-CACTTCTAGTCAGCTCCACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGAGTCTGGTCCTAGCCTGG-3′ (reverse); Mx1, 5′-CCAGAGGAGAATTGAAACCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCAACCTCAGTACCAAGC-3′ (reverse). Antiviral Assay—To determine the cellular sensitivity to the ability of IFN to reduce influenza A virus titer, cell cultures were preincubated overnight with IFN, followed by infection with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) virus for 1 h at 1 plaque-forming unit per cell. At 24 h post-infection, the virus yield in the medium was assayed by plaque formation on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as described previously (9Govorkova E.A. Fang H.B. Tan M. Webster R.G. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2004; 48: 4855-4863Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Influenza-specific Immune Assays—To assay for MHC class I functional expression, 5 × 103 WT or NFκB MEF cells were co-cultured with 1 × 105 4-39 hybridoma cells in individual wells of 96-well plates for 24 h in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and Complete tumor medium containing 0.1 μg/ml Db NP-366 peptide and IFNβ. The 4-39 hybridoma line reacts positively by IL-2 production with the immunodominant Db NP-366 peptide but negatively with DbPA-224, KbPB1–703, KbNS2–114, and DbPB1-F2–62 peptides (10Belz G.T. Xie W. Altman J.D. Doherty P.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 3486-3493Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 11Chen W. Calvo P.A. Malide D. Gibbs J. Schubert U. Bacik I. Basta S. O'Neill R. Schickli J. Palese P. Henklein P. Bennink J.R. Yewdell J.W. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 1306-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Alternatively, to assay for MHC class I antigen processing and presentation following infection with influenza virus, 5 × 103 MEF cells were cultured in individual wells of a 96-well plate in DMEM overnight in the presence or absence of IFNβ. Then MEF cells were infected with PR8 influenza A virus at 1 plaque-forming unit/cell in serum-free DMEM for 1 h, followed by coculture with 4-39 hybridoma cells (1 × 105) without or with IFNβ in DMEM plus Complete tumor medium (1:1) for 24 h. IL-2 production, which in this assay correlates directly to the MHC class I expression on the MEF cell surface, was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using purified anti-IL-2 and biotin-anti-IL-2 (Pharmingen) antibodies following the manufacturer's directions. Identification of ISGs That Are NFκB-dependent—We previously reported that NFκB plays a role in regulating ISG expression (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a functional genomics approach was used to monitor the role of NFκB in gene expression changes induced by IFN. For these experiments, we used fibroblasts derived from mice with germ line deletions of the p50 and p65 genes. These MEFs were shown to be resistant to IFN-induced NFκB activation (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and hence can be considered as NFκB-KO. In contrast, MEFs expressing p50 and p65 genes were IFN-responsive and considered WT. In three independent experiments, WT and NFκB-KO MEFs were treated in the presence or absence of IFNβ (2,500 units/ml for 5 h), and total RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized to murine U74Av2 GeneChips (Affymetrix). Control cultures received no IFN but were treated in parallel. Expression values were determined using Affymetrix Microarray Suite (MAS) 5.0 software, and the data were filtered and analyzed using GeneSpring software 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Inc.) as described previously (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After data processing, a total of 7,412 probe sets were used to compare gene expression between MEFs differing with respect to genotype (NFκB-KO and WT) and treatment (control and IFN treatment). Parametric two-way analysis of variance (p < 0.05, n = 3 for each group) identified 1,375 probe sets whose expression was different between any two of four groups (control WT MEFs, IFN-treated WT MEFs, control NFκB-KO MEFs, IFN-treated NFκB-KO MEFs). The induction of 35 genes by IFN was significantly (p < 0.05, non-parametric t test, n = 3 for each group) different between WT and NFκB-KO cells. Functional classification of NFκB-regulated ISGs using Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer analysis (12Hosack D.A. Dennis Jr., G. Sherman B.T. Lane H.C. Lempicki R.A. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R70Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed that genes encoding GTP-binding and antigen presentation proteins were significantly overrepresented (variant one-tailed Fisher exact probability test, Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer scores < 0.01). The NFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs included the 65–67-kDa guanylate-binding proteins (Gbp1 and Gbp2), the Mx proteins (Mx1 and Mx2), and the 47-kDa GTPase Ifi47 (also called Irg47) (13Taylor G.A. Feng C.G. Sher A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). GBPs play important roles in resistance to viruses (14Anderson S.L. Carton J.M. Lou J. Xing L. Rubin B.Y. Virology. 1999; 256: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 15Lee S.H. Vidal S.M. Genome Res. 2002; 12: 527-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 16Haller O. Frese M. Kochs G. Rev. Sci. Tech. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), as well as intracellular protozoa and bacteria (13Taylor G.A. Feng C.G. Sher A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the NFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs (Tap1, Tap2, Psmb9/Lmp2, and Psmb8/Lmp7) are involved in degrading intracellular proteins into antigenic peptides and contribute to the transport of these peptides to endoplasmic reticulum where they bind to the assembled MHC class I molecules (17Ploegh H.L. Nutr. Rev. 2000; 58 (S63–S73): S25-S30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). As shown in Table 1, Gbp1, Ifi47, Mx1, Mx2, Tap1, Psmb9/Lmp2, and Psmb8/Lmp7 were induced by IFN to a greater extent in NFκB-KO MEFs than in WT MEFs, while Gbp2 and Tap2 were induced more in WT MEFs than in NFκB-KO MEFs. These findings suggested that NFκB regulates the expression of a subset of ISGs that play important roles in antiviral and immune responses.TABLE 1ISGs regulated by NFκB in WT and NFκB-KO MEFsEntrez gene IDGene symbolWT fold inductioncFold induction of genes by IFN was the average of the ratio of gene induction in IFN-treated/control MEFs from three independent sets of GeneChip data.NFκB-KO fold inductioncFold induction of genes by IFN was the average of the ratio of gene induction in IFN-treated/control MEFs from three independent sets of GeneChip data.Fold induction differencedThe difference of fold induction of genes by IFN was calculated by subtracting fold induction in WT MEFs from fold induction in NFκB-KO MEFs.15953Ifi47aNFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs.111.8295.5183.617857Mx1aNFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs.114.3286.6172.217858Mx2aNFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs.35.056.921.914468Gbp1aNFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs.38.5779.5741.014469Gbp2aNFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs.411.2175.6-235.621354Tap1bNFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs.11.8734.3522.521355Tap2bNFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs.10.582.92-7.716913Pmsb8bNFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs.38.2458.9620.716912Pmsb9bNFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs.10.2918.438.115018H2-Q7bNFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs.19.8352.7833.0a NFκB-regulated GTP-binding ISGs.b NFκB-regulated antigen presentation ISGs.c Fold induction of genes by IFN was the average of the ratio of gene induction in IFN-treated/control MEFs from three independent sets of GeneChip data.d The difference of fold induction of genes by IFN was calculated by subtracting fold induction in WT MEFs from fold induction in NFκB-KO MEFs. Open table in a new tab Dose Dependence and Kinetics of NFκB-dependent ISGs—To further investigate the induction of ISGs that were negatively regulated by NFκB, quantitative real-time PCR assays were performed for Ifi47, Tap1, and Mx1 using RNA from WT and NFκB-KO MEFs treated with IFNβ. Consistent with the microarray results, Mx1, Ifi47, and Tap1 (Fig. 1) were induced by IFNβ in a dose-dependent manner to higher expression levels in NFκB-KO cells than in WT cells. Similarly, we showed previously that Mx1 and Nmi were also induced more in NFκB-KO cells than in WT cells by IFN in a dose-dependent manner (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We also examined the time course of IFN induction of these genes. Ifi47, Tap1, and Mx1 (Fig. 2A) were induced more rapidly in NFκB-KO cells compared with WT cells. For example in WT MEFs, Mx1 was induced by 2 h of IFN treatment and reached a maximal induction level of ∼15-fold after 4 h. In sharp contrast, Mx1 was induced ∼10-fold after 30 min and ∼220-fold after 4 h of IFN treatment in NFκB-KO cells. Moreover, the changes in the mRNA levels were accompanied by changes in the protein levels for Tap1 and Mx1 proteins (Fig. 2B). The effect of NFκB on regulation of these ISGs is specific, since the expression profile of another ISG, IRF1, was not regulated by NFκB (Fig. 2A). In addition, the effects of NFκB on IFN-induced gene expression did not reflect altered JAK-STAT signaling, since STAT2 activation was similar in WT and NFκB-KO MEFs (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that NFκB selectively decreased and delayed the transcription of a subset of ISGs. The Binding of p50 and p65 to the Promoters of NFκB-dependent ISGs— To investigate which NFκB proteins regulated the transcription of Ifi47, Tap1, and Mx1, we performed ChIP assays. Although STAT proteins were not basally bound to the promoters of Ifi47, Tap1, and Mx1, IFN treatment induced the binding of STAT1 and STAT2 to these promoters in WT and NFκB-KO MEFs between 15 and 60 min of IFN treatment (Fig. 3, A–C). This result was expected, since the binding of these STAT proteins is necessary for IFN-induced activation of ISG transcription. In contrast to STAT proteins, the p50 NFκB protein was basally bound to the promoter of these ISGs in WT MEFs, while p65 was basally bound to Ifi47 and Tap1 promoters. Since the genes for p50 and p65 were both deleted in NFκB-KO mice, neither protein was found bound to the promoter of these ISGs in NFκB-KO MEFs. Interestingly, in NFκB-KO MEFs IFN treatment resulted in the recruitment of IRF1 to the promoters of all three ISGs, and IRF1 recruitment closely correlated with the rapid and enhanced induction of the genes upon IFN treatment. Although IRF1 itself is an ISG, we found that IRF1 expression was not NFκB-regulated; IFN induction of IRF1 was similar in WT and NFκB-KO MEFs as determined by microarray analysis (∼6-fold) or quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 2A). Taken together these results demonstrate that NFκB directly binds to the promoters of a subset of ISGs and thereby inhibits their induction by IFN, perhaps by inhibiting recruitment of IRF1 to their promoters. p50 was bound to the promoters of all three ISG promoters and correlated with diminished ISG expression. Therefore, we examined the effect of the p50 protein alone on the induction of NFκB-regulated ISGs in MEFs derived from p50 knock-out mice. As shown in Fig. 1, Ifi47, Tap1, and Mx1 were induced by IFNβ to higher expression levels in p50-KO than in either NFκB-KO cells or in WT cells. These results suggest that p50 is the predominant negative regulator of these ISGs. NFκB Dampens the Antiviral and Immunomodulatory Activity of IFN against the Influenza Virus—The NFκB-regulated ISG Mx1 has selective antiviral activity in mice against the influenza virus (16Haller O. Frese M. Kochs G. Rev. Sci. Tech. 1998; 17: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether NFκB modulated the anti-influenza activity of IFN. WT and NFκB-KO MEFs were infected with the PR8 strain of influenza A in the absence or presence of different concentrations of IFN, and viral replication was measured after 24 h. As shown in Fig. 4, IFN (100 units/ml) results in only a 10-fold reduction in virus titer in WT MEFs. However, a 100-fold lower IFN concentration (1 unit/ml) was sufficient to induce equivalent antiviral effects in NFκB-KO as compared with WT MEFs. The NFκB-regulated ISG Tap1 is required for antigen presentation of an immunodominant influenza viral epitope (18Uger R.A. Barber B.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 685-692PubMed Google Scholar). Since IFN also modulates this facet of the host immune response, we next determined the effect of IFN on influenza-specific MHC class I antigen presentation in WT and NFκB-KO MEFs. Using a T cell hybridoma specific for the immunodominant D NP-366 influenza peptide as responder cells, we determined that antigen presentation levels were significantly enhanced by IFN treatment in NFκB-KO MEFs as compared with WT cells (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that NFκB dampens several functionally important IFN activities. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the role of NFκB in the biological actions of IFN using a functional genomic approach. We show that NFκB negatively regulates the induction of a subset of ISGs by IFN and that NFκB suppresses the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of IFN in the context of influenza virus infection. Both IFN and NFκB play critical roles in the host defense to various pathogens. However, the role of NFκB in the biological functions of IFN is relatively undefined. We previously found that the deficiency of p65 and p50 NFκB subunits sensitized MEFs to antiviral action of type I IFNs against vesicular stomatitis virus (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Indeed, NFκB increases the susceptibility of human cells to influenza virus infection (19Nimmerjahn F. Dudziak D. Dirmeier U. Hobom G. Riedel A. Schlee M. Staudt L.M. Rosenwald A. Behrends U. Bornkamm G.W. Mautner J. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 2347-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Our findings provide a possible molecular mechanism for this observation whereby p50-containing NFκB dimers basally inhibit a subset of IFN antiviral genes via binding directly to their promoters. The role of the JAK-STAT pathway in gene induction and in the generation of many of the biological effects of IFN is firmly established. However, it is now apparent that the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway alone is insufficient to account for all of the biological actions of IFNs. Some of these pathways operate independently of the JAK-STAT pathway, while other pathways may cooperate with STATs to regulate the transcription of target genes. For example, although the role of IRF9 together with the STAT1/STAT2 dimer in the transcriptional regulation of ISGs is well described, other IRF proteins can also act as transcriptional activators and/or repressors of IFN-regulated genes (2Barnes B. Lubyova B. Pitha P.M. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2002; 22: 59-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). In addition, the p300/CBP co-activators can interact with STAT proteins to regulate ISG transcription (20Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Takami K. Lo M.S. Huang G. Yu Q. Roswit W.T. Holtzman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34306-34315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We show that, although NFκB is basally bound to ISG promoters, the IFN-induced binding of STAT1 and STAT2 to these promoters was unimpeded. Therefore, NFκB does not negatively regulate ISG induction through affecting STAT binding to ISG promoters. However, NFκB proteins appear to modulate IRF1 promoter binding. IRF1 is also an IFN-induced transcriptional activator of ISG expression (22Pine R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4470-4478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show that in NFκB-KO MEFs, but not in WT MEFs, IRF1 is recruited to ISG promoters upon IFN treatment, and this recruitment closely correlates with the more rapid and enhanced ISG expression in NFκB-KO cells. Moreover, other co-activators of ISG expression (i.e. p300/CBP) are also bound to ISG promoters in the absence of NFκB proteins. 3L. Wei, R. Homayouni, and L. M. Pfeffer, unpublished observations. Therefore, NFκB may negatively regulate ISG expression by directly or indirectly inhibiting the promoter binding of co-activators of ISG expression. The notion that NFκB suppresses transcription is contrary to its classical role of stimulating the transcription of target genes. However, several recent studies indicate that NFκB may down-regulate cellular responsiveness to specific cytokines. For example, tumor necrosis factor-mediated JNK signaling is enhanced in NFκB-KO mice (23De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 24Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Moreover, we previously showed that the IFN-induced expression of some ISGs (Mx1 and Nmi) is negatively regulated by NFκB, while the expression of other ISGs, such as Ifit1 and Isg15, is enhanced by NFκB (6Pfeffer L.M. Kim J.G. Pfeffer S.R. Carrigan D.J. Baker D.P. Wei L. Homayouni R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31304-31311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that NFκB has opposing effects on different ISGs that map to a single genetic locus. For example, the induction by IFN of Gbp1 and Gbp2, which are located adjacent to one another on mouse chromosome 6, are negatively and positively regulated by NFκB, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the induction of Tap1 and Tap2, which are adjacent to one another on mouse chromosome 17, is also affected in opposite directions by NFκB (Table 1). These results suggest that NFκB may act as a transcriptional switch to fine-tune the expression of neighboring ISG family members in a locus. It will be important to determine the cellular consequences of this regulatory pathway with regard to the specific functions of Gbp and Tap family proteins. The ability to integrate multiple signaling pathways to achieve unique responses is a critical requirement for development and homeostasis in all metazoans (25Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In this study, we have characterized the relationship of the classical JAK-STAT pathway to NFκB pathway in the transcriptional regulation of Ifi47, Tap1, and Mx1. Moreover, we demonstrate that NFκB regulates the antiviral activity of IFN and the promotion of T cell activation. Type I IFNs are broadly used in clinical treatment of viral infections, multiple sclerosis, and cancer. We show that the efficacy of IFN as an antiviral agent against influenza virus is significantly enhanced in NFκB-KO MEFs. Interestingly, NFκB inhibitors are currently used to treat inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disease. Thus, we propose that the combination of IFN and NFκB inhibitors may be used to maximize the therapeutic benefit of IFN in the treatment of human disease while minimizing the dosage and possibly its undesirable side effects.

In this study, we examined the ability of hK5 to activate other hKs. By using synthetic heptapeptides that encompass the activation site of each kallikrein and recombinant pro-hKs, we demonstrated that hK5 is able to activate pro-hK2 and pro-hK3. We then showed that, following their activation, hK5 can internally cleave and deactivate hK2 and hK3. Given the predominant expression of hK2 and hK3 in the prostate, we examined the pathophysiological role of hK5 in this tissue. We studied the regulation of hK5 activity by cations (Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na2+, and K+) and citrate and showed that Zn can efficiently inhibit hK5 activity at levels well below its normal concentration in the prostate. We also show that hK5 can degrade semenogelins I and II, the major components of the seminal clot.

Our results uncover a kallikrein proteolytic cascade pathway in the prostate that participates in seminal clot liquefaction and probably in prostate cancer progression. Proteolytic cascade pathways are implicated in many physiological functions such as blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, apoptosis, digestion, among others (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Proteases are usually synthesized as inactive zymogens and require limited (auto)proteolysis of their propeptide to become active (2Khan A.R. James M.N. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 815-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Activation of a zymogen by the activated form of another protease can give rise to proteolytic cascades. This allows rapid amplification of the initial signal, followed by downstream control through inhibitors or (auto)digestion. Serine proteases, the second largest family of proteases, are known to participate in proteolytic cascade pathways, e.g. factors VII, X, and XI, during the coagulation and fibrin formation cascade (1Davie E.W.

Similarly to hKs, several serine proteases involved in sequential steps during the coagulation cascade are encoded by tandemly co-localized genes, and some may share a common ancestor (1Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 13Patthy L.

Furthermore, the facts that 14 of the 15 kallikreins (except hK4) require cleavage of their propeptide after lysine (hK6, hK7, hK8, hK12, hK13, hK14, and hK15) or arginine (hK1, hK2, hK3, hK5, hK9, hK10, and hK11) by a trypsin-like enzyme, and 12 of them are predicted to have trypsin-like activity (except hK3, hK7, and hK9, which have chymotrypsin-like activity), strengthen the possibility that hKs are part of an as yet elusive proteolytic cascade. Currently, it is known that hK2, hK4, and hK15 can activate pro-hK3 in vitro and that they may be involved in a proteolytic cascade in prostate tissue and seminal plasma (15Kumar A. Mikolajczyk S.D.

Other members of the family, such as hK5, hK8, hK11, hK13, and hK14, are also expressed in the prostate and are secreted in seminal plasma, so they might also participate in related cascades.

By using an hK5-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we have recently shown that hK5 is a potential biomarker for ovarian and breast cancer (32Yousef G.M. Polymeris M.E. Grass L.

We have previously shown that hK5 has trypsin-like activity with strong preference for Arg over Lys for the P1 position and that its activity is inhibited by the serpins α2-antiplasmin and α1-antithrombin (34Michael I.P.

Furthermore, we proposed that hK5 is implicated in tumor progression by degrading components of the extracellular matrix such as collagen types I-IV, fibronectin, and laminin and by releasing angiostatin4.5 from plasminogen (34Michael I.P.

In this study we examined the interaction of hK5 with the remaining members of the kallikrein family and its ability to activate them. We show that hK5 is able to activate pro-hK2 and pro-hK3 and subsequently deactivate them. Our data also indicate that hK5, along with other members of the human kallikrein family, may participate in a proteolytic cascade pathway that plays a role during seminal clot liquefaction and potentially in prostate cancer progression. Materials—The synthetic heptapeptides N-Ile-Gln-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-C, N-Ile-Leu-Ser-Arg-Ile-Val-Gly-C, N-Ser-Cys-Ser-Gln-Ile-Ile-Asn-C, N-Ser-Ser-Ser-Arg-Ile-Ile-Asn-C, N-Glu-Gln-Asn-Lys-Leu-Val-His-C, N-Gln-Gly-Asp-Lys-Ile-Ile-Asp-C, N-Gln-Glu-Asp-Lys-Val-Leu-Gly-C, N-Asp-Thr-Arg-Ala-Ile-Gly-C, N-Asn-Asp-Thr-Arg-Leu-Asp-Pro-C, N-Glu-Thr-Arg-Ile-Ile-Lys-C, N-Ala-Thr-Pro-Lys-Ile-Phe-Asn-C, N-Glu-Ser-Ser-Lys-Val-Leu-Asn-C, N-Asp-Glu-Asn-Lys-Ile-Ile-Gly-C, and N-Asp-Gly-Asp-Lys-Leu-Leu-Glu-C were purchased from Genemed Synthesis, San Francisco, CA. The heptapeptides were diluted with water and stored at -20 °C. The synthetic substrates, Val-Pro-Arg-AMC (VPR-AMC), Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-AMC (AAPF-AMC), and MeO-Suc-Arg-Pro-Tyr-pNA·HCl (RPY-pNA), were purchased from Bachem Bioscience (King of Prussia, PA) and the latter one from Amersham Biosciences-He-par-Chromogenix (Franklin, OH), respectively. The protease inhibitor ACT was purchased from Calbiochem; its purity was ≥95% as verified by SDS-PAGE. A 25-cm C18 column, 50-Å pore size, was purchased from TOSOH, Grove City, OH. Mutated pro[Val217]hK2 (pro-hK2mut), which abolishes its ability to autoactivate, and wild-type-active hK2 (hK2wt) were obtained from Hybritech Inc., San Diego, CA. Pro-hK3 was obtained from Spectra Diagnostics Inc, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. hK5 was produced in-house as has been previously described (34Michael I.P. Sotiropoulou G. Pampalakis G. Magklara A. Ghosh M. Wasney G. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14628-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Semenogelins I and II were purified from seminal plasma as has been previously described (35Malm J. Hellman J. Magnusson H. Laurell C.B. Lilja H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins 1-6 were purchased from Diagnostic System Laboratories, Webster, TX. Cleavage of Heptapeptides by hK5—25 μg of the heptapeptides were incubated with 1 μg of hK5 (1500:1 molar ratio) in assay buffer (hK5 optimal buffer, 100 mm phosphate buffer, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0), at a final volume of 150 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h and terminated by freezing the samples with liquid nitrogen. 100 μl from each time point was diluted 1.5-fold with loading buffer (distilled H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and loaded to a C18 column connected to an high-performance liquid chromatography system at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Elution was performed by using Buffer A (distilled H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and Buffer B (acetonitrile 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) with a linear gradient of 0-100% acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Activation of Pro-hK3 and Pro-hK2mut by hK5—The activation of pro-hK2mut and pro-hK3 was monitored by complex formation of hK2 and hK3 with the serpin ACT, an inhibitor for the aforementioned kallikreins but not for hK5. After incubating pro-hK2mut and pro-hK3 with hK5 at different molar ratios and incubation times, ACT and assay buffer for hK2 and hK3 (hK2 optimal buffer, 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm NaCl, 0.01%Tween 20, pH 7.5, and hK3 optimal buffer, 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, 3 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) were added in a final volume 150 μl. The reaction was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and terminated by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Positive and negative controls were included as well. 25-μl samples of each reaction were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and stained with Coomassie Blue to monitor the hK2/3·ACT complex formation. The activation of pro-hK3 by hK5 was also monitored by the release of AMC or pNA and the increase of fluorescence or absorbance, respectively, from hK3-specific substrates, i.e. AAPF-AMC and RPY-pNA. Pro-hK3 was incubated with hK5, at different molar ratios and incubation times, in hK5 assay buffer at 37 °C. The final volume was 50 μl, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of aprotinin (1:100 molar ratio). The activation of pro-hK3 was monitored by adding AAPF-AMC, as above, and assay buffer in a final volume of 200 μl. Reactions were set up in microtiter wells and incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence or absorbance increase was measured for 20 min on a Wallac Victor fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) set at 355 nm for excitation and 460 nm for emission for the AMC substrate and absorbance at 405 nm for the pNA substrate. Enzyme-free reactions, for all substrate concentrations, were used as negative controls, and background fluorescence or absorbance was subtracted from each value. A reaction with hK5 alone and pro-hK3 without incubation with hK5 were used as negative controls. Duplicate reactions were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions in two different gels. The first was stained with Coomassie Blue, whereas the second was electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™-C Extra). Western blots were performed by using a polyclonal hK3 as primary antibody. Western Blotting for Detection of the hK3 Fragments in Seminal Plasma and Prostate—Seminal plasma from healthy individuals were leftovers of samples submitted for routine biochemical testing that had been stored at -80 °C. The prostate extracts were the healthy samples from matched healthy cancerous prostatic tissue pairs were obtained from prostate cancer patients who had undergone radical retropubic prostatectomy for prostatic adenocarcinoma at the Charite University Hospital (Berlin, Germany). The patients had not received hormonal therapy before surgery. The tissue samples were dissected from cancerous and noncancerous (healthy) portions of the prostate immediately after surgical removal. The samples were stored in liquid N2 until needed. To determine the malignant or benign nature of the tissue samples, a histological analysis was performed as described previously (36Meyer A. Jung K. Lein M. Rudolph B. Schnorr D. Loening S.A. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These samples were approved for research purpose use by the Ethics Committee of the Charite Hospital. The samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (NuPAGE 4-12% Bis-Tris gels, Invitrogen) and subsequently electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™-C Extra). Western blots were performed as above. Effect of Cations (Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na2+ and K+) and Citrate on hK5 Activity—To determine the effect of the cations (solutions made from salts of ZnCl2, NaCl, KCl, MgCl2, and CaCl2) and citrate on hK5 activity, reactions mixtures were set up as follows: purified recombinant hK5 (final concentration of 12 nm) was incubated with each cation and citrate (final concentrations of 0, 12, 60, 120, 1,200, and 12,000 nm) diluted in the assay buffer (0.1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0) at a final volume of 100 μl in microtubes for 10 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. After incubation, the fluorogenic substrate VPR-AMC (final concentration of 1 mm) was applied to each hK5-cation/citrate mixture separately. Reactions were set up in microtiter wells and incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured for 15 min as described before. Enzyme-free reactions, for all cations/citrate and substrate, were used as negative controls, and background fluorescence was subtracted from each value. All experiments were done in triplicate. Reversal of Zn2+ Inhibition of hK5 Activity by Semenogelin I and II—hK5 (final concentration, 10 nm) was incubated with Zn2+ (final concentration, 5 μm) to a final volume of 100 μl in microtubes for 10 min at 37 °C with gentle agitation. After incubation, the fluorogenic substrate VPR-AMC (final concentration of 0.8 mm) was added. Reactions were set up in microtiter wells and incubated at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured for 20 min as described before. At certain points, during measurement, semenogelin I or II (final concentration, 0.05 μm) and EDTA (final concentration, 10 mm) were added in each microtiter well. Enzyme-free reactions were used as negative controls, and background fluorescence was subtracted from each value. All experiments were done in triplicate. Cleavage of Semenogelins I and II by hK5—Purified semenogelins I and II (5 μg) were incubated separately with 165 ng of hK5 in 100 mm Na2HPO4, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0, 0.2 m urea or with 165 ng of hK2 in 0.1 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5, 0.2 m urea at 37 °C for 2 and 8 h. The reactions were terminated by freezing in liquid nitrogen. Subsequently, the reactions were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gels were stained with silver staining. Cleavage of IGFBPs by hK5—IGFBP1-6 (450 ng) were incubated separately with 50 ng of hK5 in 100 mm Na2HPO4, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 8.0 at 37 °C for different time points. The reactions were terminated by freezing in liquid nitrogen. The reactions were run on SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the gels were stained with silver staining. N-terminal Sequencing—N-terminal sequencing was performed with the Edman degradation method. Proteins were transferred by electroblotting to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and visualized with Coomassie Blue stain. Cleavage of Heptapeptides by hK5—Because fourteen out of the fifteen human kallikreins (except hK4) require cleavage after Arg (hK1, hK2, hK3, hK5, hK9, hK10, and hK11) or Lys (hK6, hK7, hK8, hK12, hK13, hK14, and hK15) for propeptide release and activation, and hK5 has trypsin-like activity (34Michael I.P. Sotiropoulou G. Pampalakis G. Magklara A. Ghosh M. Wasney G. Diamandis E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14628-14635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we designed heptapeptides encompassing the putative P1-P4 and P′1-P′3 positions of the activation site of each kallikrein. We incubated these peptides with hK5 for various time intervals, and the reactions were monitored with high-performance liquid chromatography chromatography, using a C18 column. The time-dependent decrease of the height and the area under the main peak representing the intact heptapeptide and the generation of one or two new peaks representing the P1-P4 and P′1-P′3 fragments was indicative of the efficiency of hK5 to cleave each heptapeptide. hK5 was able to cleave the heptapeptides encompassing the cleavage sites for hK1, hK2, and hK3 with high efficiency; the heptapeptides for hK5, hK9, hK11, and hK12 with moderate efficiency and the heptapeptides for hK7, hK8, and hK15 with low efficiency. No cleavage was observed for the heptapeptides for hK4, hK6, hK10, hK13, and hK14. The data are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Relative efficiency of cleavage of heptapeptides by hK5Heptapeptide sequencePro-hKCleavage efficiency(N→C)aSingle letter representation.IQSR ↓ IVGbArrows indicate cleavage site.

Open table in a new tab Activation and Deactivation of Pro-hK3 and Pro-hK2mut by hK5—Given the above findings (Table 1) we examined the ability of hK5 to activate recombinant pro-hK2mut and pro-hK3. After incubating both pro-hK2 and pro-hK3 with hK5 we monitored their activation through binding to the serpin ACT. Both pro-hK2mut and pro-hK3, after incubation with hK5, became active and formed a complex with ACT (Fig. 1, A and B). Because hK3 has chymotrypsin-like activity, we monitored its activation by hK5, by adding a chymotrypsin-like fluorogenic or chromogenic substrate. The activation was dependent on the pro-hK3:hK5 molar ratio and the time of incubation (Fig. 2, A and B). At a pro-hK3:hK5 molar ratio of 10:1, the reaction rate decreased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). By SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining we observed generation of degradation products of hK3 (Fig. 3A). The bands 1, 2, and 5 had N-terminal sequence of IVGGWE due to activation of pro-hK3 by hK5 (cleavage of the peptide bond at the activation site between Arg-1 and Ile1), bands 3 and 4 had a sequence of FLRPGDD due to internal cleavage of hK3 between Arg85 and Phe86, whereas band 6 had a sequence of STCSGDS due to internal cleavage of hK3 between Lys182 and Ser183. These results indicate that hK5 is able to activate and subsequently deactivate hK3 by internal cleavage.FIGURE 3Deactivation of hK3 by hK5 (A and B) and detection of hK3 fragments in vivo (C and D). Pro-hK3 was incubated with hK5 at a 1:10 molar ratio for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min at 37 °C (lanes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively) visualized by Coomassie Blue (A) and Western blotting (B). The kallikreins hK5 and pro-hK3 alone are shown in lanes 1 and 2, respectively. The fragments that have been subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing are indicated by arrows. The hK3 fragments generated by hK5 can be detected by Western blots in tissue extracts and seminal plasma (closed arrowheads; panels C and D, respectively). The open arrowheads represent hK3 fragments generated by unknown protease(s).

Typically, hK3 in this fluid is clipped 20-30% of between residues Arg85 and Phe86, Lys145 and Lys146, and Lys182 and Ser183 (37Chen Z. Chen H. Stamey T.A. J.

By using a polyclonal antibody against hK3, we performed Western blots of seminal plasma, prostate extracts and at different time points of the activation of pro-hK3 by hK5. We were able to detect four of the five predicted fragments generated by the incubation of pro-hK3 with hK5 (one fragment is probably not recognized by our antibodies) (Fig. 3B). In seminal plasma, we detected all four bands generated by the cleavage of pro-hK3 by hK5 at the peptide bonds Arg85-Phe86 and Lys182-Ser183 plus two bands generated by the cleavage at the peptide bond Lys145-Lys146 (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we were able to detect the same fragments in prostate tissue extracts (Fig. 3D), indicating that the deactivation of hK3 may initiate within the prostate, after its secretion. During the activation of pro-hK2mut by hK5 we also observed the generation of two fragments (Fig. 1A, lane 6). The N-terminal sequence of band 1 was IVGGWE due to activation of pro-hK2mut by hK5 (cleavage of the peptide bond at the activation site between Arg-1 and Ile1). The N-terminal sequence of band 2 was SLQCVSL to internal due cleavage of hK2mut between Arg145 and Ser146. hK2 has been shown to internally cleave itself after autoactivation (40Lovgren J. Tian S. Lundwall A. Karp M. Lilja H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1050-1055Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the overall catalytic efficiency of the mutated hK2 form, i.e. hK2mut, used in this study, is <0.01% of wild-type hK2 (41Mikolajczyk S.D. Millar L.S. Marker K.M. Grauer L.S. Goel A. Cass M.M. Kumar A. Saedi M.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 440-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the same study, it has also been shown that hK2mut has a slightly altered P1 from Arg to Tyr. These data led us to conclude that hK2mut fragmentation is due to hK5 activity and not to autolysis. Effect of Cations and Citrate on hK5 Activity—The cations Zn2+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and K+ and the anion citrate are present at high levels in seminal plasma and prostatic fluid and play an important role in the regulation of protease activity (42Kavanagh J.P.

https://openalex.org/W2163665787,"The specific post-translational modifications of the histone proteins are associated with specific DNA-templated processes, such as transcriptional activation or repression. To investigate the biological role(s) of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4 Lys-20) methylation, we created a novel panel of antibodies that specifically detected mono-, di-, or trimethylated H4 Lys-20. We report that the different methylated forms of H4 Lys-20 are compartmentalized within visually distinct, transcriptionally silent regions in the mammalian nucleus. Interestingly, direct comparison of methylated H4 Lys-20 with the different methylated states of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3 Lys-9) revealed significant overlap and exclusion between the specific groups of methyl modifications. Trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were both selectively enriched within pericentric heterochromatin. Similarly, monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 partitioned together and the dimethylated forms partitioned together within the chromosome arms; however, the mono- and dimethylated modifications were virtually exclusive. These findings strongly suggest that the combinatorial presence or absence of the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 define particular types of silent chromatin. Consistent with this, detailed analysis of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 revealed that both were preferentially and selectively enriched within the same nucleosome particle in vivo. Collectively, these findings define a novel trans-tail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 that act cooperatively to mark distinct regions of silent chromatin within the mammalian epigenome. The specific post-translational modifications of the histone proteins are associated with specific DNA-templated processes, such as transcriptional activation or repression.

Interestingly, direct comparison of methylated H4 Lys-20 with the different methylated states of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3 Lys-9) revealed significant overlap and exclusion between the specific groups of methyl modifications. Trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were both selectively enriched within pericentric heterochromatin. Similarly, monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 partitioned together and the dimethylated forms partitioned together within the chromosome arms; however, the mono- and dimethylated modifications were virtually exclusive. These findings strongly suggest that the combinatorial presence or absence of the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 define particular types of silent chromatin. Consistent with this, detailed analysis of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 revealed that both were preferentially and selectively enriched within the same nucleosome particle in vivo. Collectively, these findings define a novel trans-tail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 that act cooperatively to mark distinct regions of silent chromatin within the mammalian epigenome. Within eukaryotic nuclei, DNA associates with nuclear proteins to form chromatin. The most fundamental structural unit of chromatin, the nucleosome, is composed of ∼146 bp of DNA wrapped around an octamer of the core histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (1van Holde K.E. Chromatin.in: Rich A. Springer Series in Molecular Biology. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1988Google Scholar). Although much has been elucidated about chromatin in the last decade, it remains unclear how distinct functional domains of chromatin are established and maintained within living cells. It is well known that chromatin function is modulated, at least in part, by enzymes that post-translationally modify specific amino acids on the histone proteins (2Wolffe A.P. Hayes J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Such post-translational modifications include acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation (3Peterson C.L. Laniel M.A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that specific covalent modifications, alone or in combination, directly participate in specific downstream nuclear processes including transcription, replication, and repair (4Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7632) Google Scholar). Thus, it is theorized that this “histone code” may serve to establish and maintain distinct functional domains that are epigenetically transmitted (5Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6584) Google Scholar, 6Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 7Turner B.M.

One histone modification that has received increased attention is the methylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4 Lys-20). 2The abbreviations used are: H4 Lys-20, histone H4 lysine 20; H3 Lys-9, histone H3 lysine 9; H4 Lys-16, histone H4 lysine 16; H2B Lys-123, histone H2B lysine 123; HMT, histone methyltransferase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; pol, polymerase. 2The abbreviations used are: H4 Lys-20, histone H4 lysine 20; H3 Lys-9, histone H3 lysine 9; H4 Lys-16, histone H4 lysine 16; H2B Lys-123, histone H2B lysine 123; HMT, histone methyltransferase; MEF, mouse embryonic fibroblast; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; pol, polymerase. Although this methylated histone lysine residue was identified over 40 years ago, the biological significance of this modification has remained enigmatic (8Murray K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Investigations into H4 Lys-20 methylation were complicated by the fact that the epsilon amino group of lysine residues can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated in vivo (9Zhang K. Tang H. J. Chromatogr. B. Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 783: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of the histone methyltransferase enzymes (HMTs) responsible for making the specific H4 Lys-20 methyl modifications have led to important insights into their potential biological functions (10Fang J. Feng Q. Ketel C.S. Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Simon J.A. Zhang Y. Curr.

PR-Set7, also known as Set8, is responsible for the majority of monomethylated H4 Lys-20, whereas the Suv4-20 HMTs are responsible for the bulk of trimethylated H4 Lys-20 in flies and humans (12Schotta G.

Recent studies strongly suggest that H4 Lys-20 methylation and the HMTs that create these marks are involved in many important DNA-associated processes including transcriptional silencing, higher order chromatin structure, differentiation, genomic stability, and cell division (12Schotta G.

Neurochem. 2005; 94: 324-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent finding indicates that H4 Lys-20 methylation and the H4 Lys-20 HMT homologue in fission yeast play a role in DNA double-strand break repair, although this has yet to be confirmed in higher eukaryotes (22Sanders S.L. Portoso M. Mata J. Bahler J. Allshire R.C. Kouzarides T. Cell. 2004; 119: 603-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). To further study the function(s) of the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20, we created a novel panel of H4 Lys-20 methyl-specific antibodies. Use of these antibodies in indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed that the mono-, di-, and trimethylated forms of H4 Lys-20 partitioned to distinct compartments of silent chromatin in the mammalian nucleus. Because we had previously observed similar partitioning of the methylated forms of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3 Lys-9) (23Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), a direct comparison was made between the different methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9. Surprisingly, we discovered that there was a selective enrichment within the same silent nuclear compartments specifically for similar methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9. Consistent results were obtained on extended chromatin fibers. Further analysis revealed that monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were preferentially and selectively enriched on the same nucleosome core particles in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicate that a trans-tail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 exists in higher eukaryotes and is likely to play an important role in the formation of a specific repressive chromatin state. Antibody Characterization and Western Analysis—For antibody characterization, 200 ng of recombinant human histone H4, 2 μg of acid-extracted chicken histones, and whole cell lysates from 105 HeLa cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, blocked in 5% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline, and incubated with the H4 Lys-20 mono-(1:150,000), di-(1:100,000), or trimethyl (1:20,000) antibodies in 1% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h rotating at room temperature. Following three washes in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:5,000) in 1% nonfat milk/Tris-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Results were visualized by exposure to film for 1 min. For competition experiments, each antibody was preincubated with 1 μg of each peptide for 1 h rotating at room temperature before addition to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane containing whole cell lysate from 105 HeLa cells. The linear peptides used for these studies correspond to residues 16-25 of histone H4. Immunofluorescence—Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were prepared, fixed, and stained as described previously (24Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Antibody dilutions used were as follows: H4 Lys-20 mono-(1:1,000), di-(1:500), and trimethyl (1:1,000); H3 Lys-9 mono-(1:1,000; Upstate), di-(1:2,000; Upstate), and trimethyl (1:1,000; Upstate); RNA pol II (1:1,000, Covance). Dual staining was performed as described previously (24Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Staining was visualized using a ×63 objective on a Zeiss LSM 510 dual-photon confocal microscope. Pictures were analyzed using Adobe PhotoShop CS2. Chromatin Fibers—Chromatin fibers were prepared as described previously with the following modifications (25Sullivan B.A. Karpen G.H. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1076-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Nuclei were extracted from HeLa cells using ice cold nuclear isolation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and isolated by centrifugation. Nuclei were lysed in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 m urea to liberate chromatin that was spread onto supercharged microscope slides (VWR) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Slides were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 37 °C. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in blocking solution and applied to slides followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C. Slides were washed three times in 0.05% Triton X-100/phosphate-buffered saline prior to a 2-h room temperature incubation with secondary antibodies. Staining was visualized using a ×60 objective on a DeltaVision Spectris microscope, and images were taken with softWoRx (Applied Precision). Pictures were analyzed using Adobe PhotoShop CS2. Immunoprecipitations—Nuclei obtained from HeLa cells were resuspended in micrococcal nuclease digestion buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml as determined by A260. Micrococcal nuclease was added to the nuclei (50 units/0.5 mg) and digested for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, and mononucleosomes were isolated by centrifugation. One hundred micrograms of mononucleosomes were incubated with 100 μl of the H4 Lys-20 monomethyl-specific antibody or 180 μl of the H4 Lys-20 trimethyl-specific antibody in micrococcal nuclease digestion buffer and precipitated with Pro-A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Beads were sequentially washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50, 100, or 150 mm NaCl. The bound material was eluted in Tris-EDTA, 1% SDS by intermittent vortexing for 30 min. SDS-PAGE was used to fractionate 2% of the input material and 5% of the eluted bound material, which was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride and immunoblotted with the various methyl-specific antibodies. Generation of Histone H4 Lys-20 Methyl-specific Antibodies—To determine the biological significance of the different states of H4 Lys-20 methylation, polyclonal antibodies were developed using twicebranched synthetic peptides engineered from amino acids 16-25 of the human histone H4 sequence containing a mono-, di-, or trimethylated Lys-20 residue (Fig. 1A) (26Perez-Burgos L. Peters A.H. Opravil S. Kauer M. Mechtler K. Jenuwein T. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 376: 234-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Western analysis demonstrated that each antibody specifically detected only modified histone H4 as the antibodies failed to detect the unmodified recombinant histone H4 or any other cellular protein from HeLa whole cell lysates (Fig. 1B). To determine the H4 Lys-20 methyl specificity of each antibody, the modified peptides were used in peptide competition experiments as described previously (24Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). The results indicate that only the H4 Lys-20 mono-, di-, and trimethylated linear peptides were able to effectively absorb the appropriate signal of the H4 Lys-20 mono-, di-, and trimethyl antibodies, respectively (Fig. 1C). Similar experiments confirmed that the antibodies are also highly specific in immunofluorescence (see supplemental Fig. S1) and immunoprecipitation experiments (see Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Preferential and selective enrichment of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 on the same nucleosomal core particle in vivo. A, mononucleosomes prepared from HeLa cells were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the H4 Lys-20 monomethyl-specific antibody. Western analysis (WB) of 2% of the input material and 5% of the eluted bound material indicates that the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes are specifically enriched for the monomethylated form of H4 Lys-20. NS represents nonspecific signal most likely generated by performing both the immunoprecipitation and the Western analysis with rabbit polyclonal antibodies. B, Western analysis of the H4 Lys-20 monomethyl-enriched nucleosomes indicates that they are also selectively enriched for monomethylated H3 Lys-9. C, mononucleosomes were immunoprecipitated with the H4 Lys-20 trimethyl-specific antibody. Western analysis of 2% of the input material and 5% of the eluted bound material indicates that the immunoprecipitated nucleosomes are specifically enriched for the trimethylated form of H4 Lys-20. D, Western analysis of the H4 Lys-20 trimethyl-enriched nucleosomes indicates that there is a preferential enrichment for trimethylated H3 Lys-9 in vivo, although the mono- and dimethylated forms of H3 Lys-9 are also detected to a lesser extent. Consistent results were obtained in three independent immunoprecipitations for each methyl-specific antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) One potential problem associated with modification-specific antibodies is “epitope masking,” a phenomenon in which neighboring post-translational modifications hinder the ability of the antibody to effectively bind its epitope. To determine whether H4 Lys-16 acetylation, the nearest known potential modification to H4 Lys-20, could impair the ability of the antibodies to detect H4 Lys-20 methylation, histones were hyperacetylated using the yeast NuA4 complex (27Allard S. Utley R.T. Savard J. Clarke A. Grant P. Brandl C.J. Pillus L. Workman J.L. Cote J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5108-5119Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 28Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D. Winston F. Berger S.L. Workman J.L. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1640-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Although significant increases in H4 Lys-16 acetylation were readily detected by Western analysis, the detection efficiency of our H4 Lys-20 methyl antibodies were unaffected by global increases in H4 Lys-16 acetylation (Fig. 1D). Therefore, antibodies specific to the mono-, di-, or trimethylated form of H4 Lys-20 were successfully generated and could be used confidently to investigate the biological relevance of each of these histone modifications. Different Methylated States of H4 Lys-20 Partition to Distinct Silent Nuclear Compartments—To determine the nuclear localizations of each of the H4 Lys-20 methyl modifications, immunofluorescence experiments were performed in female MEFs using the methyl-specific antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2A, mono- and dimethylated H4 Lys-20 were distributed throughout the interphase nucleus but tended to be predominantly targeted to specific chromosomal regions, as evidenced by their intense punctate staining. Monomethylated H4 Lys-20 appeared to be enriched toward the nuclear periphery, was generally excluded from nucleoli, and was enriched within the facultative heterochromatin of the female inactive X chromosome (Figs. 2B and 3A) (29Kohlmaier A. Savarese F. Lachner M. Martens J. Jenuwein T. Wutz A. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E171Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In contrast, dimethylated H4 Lys-20 was dispersed fairly evenly throughout the nucleus, was consistently found in the nucleoli, and was not enriched on the inactive X chromosome. Both mono- and dimethyl modifications were excluded from the DAPI-dense constitutive heterochromatic pericentric foci, where trimethylated H4 Lys-20 was primarily localized (Fig. 2A) (30Kourmouli N. Jeppesen P. Mahadevhaiah S. Burgoyne P. Wu R. Gilbert D.M. Bongiorni S. Prantera G. Fanti L. Pimpinelli S. Shi W. Fundele R. Singh P.B. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2491-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To determine whether mono- and dimethylated H4 Lys-20 were found within similar nuclear compartments, dual staining experiments were performed as described previously (24Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, mono- and dimethylated H4 Lys-20 appear to be mutually exclusive as evidenced by the lack of co-staining.FIGURE 3Specific methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 co-localize to the same silent nuclear compartments. A, MEFs co-stained for monomethylated H4 Lys-20 (Cy3; red) and either mono- (top panels) or dimethylated (bottom panels) H3 Lys-9 (FITC, green). Monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 are preferentially enriched within the same silent nuclear compartments as observed by the large amount of yellow in the merged image. In contrast, monomethylated H4 Lys-20 is mostly excluded from dimethylated H3 Lys-9 regions except on the inactive X chromosome (xi). B, MEFs co-stained for dimethylated H4 Lys-20 (Cy3; red) and either mono- (top panels) or dimethylated (bottom panels) H3 Lys-9 (FITC; green). Dimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 co-localize to similar silent nuclear compartments (yellow in the merged image), although there are also regions where they are mutually exclusive. Dimethylated H4 Lys-20 does not co-localize to monomethylated H3 Lys-9 nuclear compartments. C, MEFs co-stained for trimethylated H4 Lys-20 (Cy3; red) and H3 Lys-9 (FITC; green). Both modifications are dramatically enriched within DAPI-dense pericentric heterochromatin. Bar = 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although it was clear that trimethylated H4 Lys-20 was enriched within constitutive heterochromatin, the speckling patterns observed for mono- and dimethylated H4 Lys-20 were reminiscent of transcriptionally engaged chromatin. To determine whether these modifications were associated with active regions of the genome, dual staining experiments were performed with the methyl-specific antibodies and a monoclonal RNA pol II antibody (Fig. 2A). In all cases, RNA pol II was found evenly dispersed throughout the nucleus and was excluded from the nucleoli. Comparison with RNA pol II staining revealed that the majority of mono- and dimethylated H4 Lys-20 was excluded from transcriptionally active regions, as demonstrated by the lack of co-staining in the merged images, indicating that the majority of all forms of H4 Lys-20 methylation are enriched within silent chromatin. Collectively, these findings indicate that mono-, di-, and trimethylated H4 Lys-20 are each targeted to distinct transcriptionally inactive nuclear compartments. Similar Methylated States of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 Are Enriched within the Same Silent Nuclear Compartments—The differential nuclear localizations of the methylated forms of H4 Lys-20 were strikingly similar to the previously described localizations of the various methylated forms of H3 Lys-9 (23Peters A.H. Kubicek S. Mechtler K. O'Sullivan R.J. Derijck A.A. Perez-Burgos L. Kohlmaier A. Opravil S. Tachibana M. Shinkai Y. Martens J.H. Jenuwein T. Mol.

Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Based on this, we hypothesized that similar methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were targeted to the same silent nuclear compartments. To test this hypothesis, dual staining experiments were performed in MEFs using various combinations of the methyl-specific antibodies (Fig. 3). Consistent with previous reports, the bulk of both trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and trimethylated H3 Lys-9 was enriched within pericentric heterochromatin (Fig. 3C) (12Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 30Kourmouli N. Jeppesen P. Mahadevhaiah S. Burgoyne P. Wu R.

Similar to trimethylation, the majority of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 was localized to the same nuclear compartments as monomethylated H3 Lys-9 (Fig. 3A). Although the overlap between monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and dimethylated H3 Lys-9 was detected, especially on the inactive X chromosome, co-localization was less pronounced when compared with monomethylated H3 Lys-9. Dimethylated H4 Lys-20 consistently appeared to preferentially co-localize to dimethylated H3 Lys-9 compartments when compared with monomethylated H3 Lys-9 (Fig. 3B). Although dimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 do partition to the same compartments, there also appeared to be many regions where these two modifications were mutually exclusive. In contrast, our results demonstrate that the majority of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 are enriched within the same transcriptionally silent nuclear compartments. Similar Methylated States of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 Are Enriched within the Same Regions along Chromatin Fibers—To examine the colocalization of these different repressive methyl modifications at higher resolution, dual staining experiments were performed on extended chromatin fibers from HeLa cells using the various methyl-specific antibodies (Fig. 4). Similar to the findings in the MEF interphase nuclei, the monomethylated forms of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were preferentially targeted to the same silent regions along the chromatin fiber (Fig. 4A). The well defined punctate staining pattern of these monomethyl histone modifications strongly suggests that they are enriched within specific genomic regions, although these regions are currently undefined. It is important to note that although monomethylated H4 Lys-20 nearly always co-localized with monomethylated H3 Lys-9, monomethylated H3 Lys-9 was also found in silent regions along the chromatin fibers that were devoid of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 (Fig. 4A). In comparison, dimethylated H3 Lys-9 was more dispersed along the length of the chromatin fiber and, consistent with the findings in interphase nuclei, appeared to be preferentially enriched in the same dispersed regions as dimethylated H3 Lys-9 (Fig. 4B). Although dimethylated H4 Lys-20 also seemed to localize to some regions along the chromatin fibers that were enriched in monomethylated H3 Lys-9, closer examination of these regions revealed that dimethylated H4 Lys-20 was flanking the monomethylated H3 Lys-9 regions (Fig. 4D). Similar experiments were performed for trimethylated H4 Lys-20. Although we speculated that this modification was restricted to pericentric repeats, and thus, would be difficult to detect on chromatin fibers, trimethylated H4 Lys-20 was enriched within specific regions throughout the length of the fibers (Fig. 4C). As expected, trimethylated H3 Lys-9 co-localized to these regions. Unexpectedly, mono- and dimethylated H3 Lys-9 also co-localized to these regions, although much less frequently. Collectively, these results support the above findings and suggest that similar methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 (i.e. mono-, di-, or tri-) are targeted to the same genomic regions of silent chromatin. Monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 Are Targeted to the Same Nucleosome in Vivo—The findings above suggested that corresponding methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 would be enriched within the same nucleosomal core particle, especially the mono- and trimethylated forms. To determine this, immunoprecipitations were performed with the mono- or trimethyl-specific H4 Lys-20 antibodies on mononucleosomes prepared from HeLa cells (Fig. 5). Following the immunoprecipitation, Western analysis of the antibody-bound material was performed to verify the enrichment of each modification. Indeed, the monomethyl H4 Lys-20 antibody specifically enriched for nucleosomes containing this modification, whereas di- and trimethylated H4 Lys-20 were not (Fig. 5A). Similarly, the H4 Lys-20 trimethyl-specific antibody enriched for nucleosomes containing this modification but not for the mono- or dimethylated H4 Lys-20 nucleosomes (Fig. 5C). Although similar experiments were attempted with the H4 Lys-20 dimethyl-specific antibodies, we were unsuccessful in obtaining nucleosomes specifically enriched for dimethylated H4 Lys-20. Western analyses were performed on the immunoprecipitated material using the H3 Lys-9 methyl-specific antibodies. Consistent with the immunofluorescence data, monomethylated H3 Lys-9 was exclusively detected in nucleosomes containing monomethylated H4 Lys-20; di- and trimethylated H3 Lys-9 were not detected within these nucleosomes (Fig. 5B). Similar to the chromatin fiber findings, trimethylated H3 Lys-9 was preferentially detected in the H4 Lys-20 trimethyl-enriched nucleosomes; however, mono- and dimethylated H3 Lys-9 were also detected, albeit to a far lesser extent (Fig. 5D). Although the importance of these results remains unclear, it reinforces our findings that only the monomethylated forms of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were specifically enriched within the same nucleosomal core particle. Therefore, a trans-tail histone code involving these two repressive marks is associated with distinct regions of silent chromatin. Although histones have long been known to be methylated in vivo, the exact biological importance of this modification has remained elusive (31Rice J.C. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to further the current understanding of the biological role(s) of the mono-, di-, and trimethylated forms of H4 Lys-20, the first described methylated histone lysine residue (8Murray K. Biochemistry. 1964; 3: 10-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). To this end, we successfully created a novel panel of H4 Lys-20 methyl-specific antibodies that, remarkably, do not cross-react with the other methyl modifications on Lys-20, nor are they inhibited by the neighboring acetylation of H4 Lys-16 (Fig. 1). These methyl-specific antibodies were used to determine that each methylated form of H4 Lys-20 partitions to distinct nuclear compartments that appear, at least by indirect immunofluorescence, to be excluded from transcriptionally engaged chromatin (Fig. 2). As we had previously demonstrated, different HMTs are responsible for the specific level of methylation of a specific histone residue in vivo (24Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Therefore, these findings strongly suggest that the HMTs, themselves, are targeted to distinct genomic regions, by unknown mechanisms, to create these histone marks, which ultimately result in distinct transcriptionally repressive chromatin states. A recent report described that monomethylated H4 Lys-20 was associated with transcriptionally active chromatin as determined by co-localization with RNA pol II and hyperacetylated H4 using indirect immunofluorescence in mouse erythroleukemia cells (32Talasz H. Lindner H.H. Sarg B. Helliger W. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38814-38822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the β-major region, a gene that is dramatically up-regulated during Me2SO-induced differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells (33Sawado T. Igarashi K. Groudine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10226-10231Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), demonstrated a 3-4-fold increase in monomethylated H4 Lys-20 at the β-major promoter and second exon in differentiated mouse erythroleukemia cells when compared with non-differentiated cells. In contrast to these findings, our results are in agreement with several independent reports that monomethylated H4 Lys-20 is associated with transcriptionally silent chromatin in higher eukaryotes (10Fang J. Feng Q. Ketel C.S. Wang H. Cao R. Xia L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Simon J.A. Zhang Y. Curr.

Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Although the reason for this discrepancy is unclear, it does reinforce recent observations that specific histone modifications can also be associated with a juxtaposed DNA-templated process, at least in mouse erythroid cells. For example, it was demonstrated that trimethylated H3 Lys-9, which has become a benchmark of repressed chromatin, was enriched within the actively transcribed regions (but not promoters) of several inducible genes, including β-major, in mouse cells of erythroid lineage (35Vakoc C.R. Mandat S.A. Olenchock B.A. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 381-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). Therefore, although we find that the majority of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 is associated with repressed chromatin (Fig. 2), it may also serve an additional role in the active transcription of mouse genes associated with erythroid differentiation. It is unknown whether these observations are valid for other classes of genes and/or in different cell types; further experiments are required to delineate this. Consistent with previous reports, we found trimethylated H4 Lys-20 enriched within the major and minor satellite repeats of pericentric heterochromatin (19Martens J.H. O'Sullivan R.J. Braunschweig U. Opravil S. Radolf M. Steinlein P. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These findings imply that this modification may specifically mark regions of constitutive heterochromatin, regions that are believed to always be repressed (36Hennig W. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1999; 108: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). We observed that the bulk of monomethylated H4 Lys-20 was enriched within silent regions of the chromosome arms and was also enriched within the female inactive X chromosome (Figs. 2A and 3B). These findings imply that this modification may specifically mark regions of facultative heterochromatin, chromatin that is silent but has the faculty to become active. If this is true, where does dimethylated H4 Lys-20 fit into the defined types of heterochromatin? This repressive modification is clearly independent of mono- and trimethylated H4 Lys-20, and therefore, constitutive and facultative heterochromatin (Fig. 2). Based on this, it is conceivable that dimethylated H4 Lys-20 may define an entirely unique type of heterochromatin that has not yet been described. The discovery of the HMT responsible for H4 Lys-20 dimethylation will provide key insights into this theory. Because we had previously observed similar nuclear compartmentalization of the different methylated states of H3 Lys-9 (24Rice J.C. Briggs S.D. Ueberheide B. Barber C.M. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Shinkai Y. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1591-1598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that both modifications would partition together within these silent regions. Indeed, by employing several techniques, our findings indicate that the corresponding methylated states of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 tend to localize to the same silent compartments in the nucleus (Fig. 3) and within the same genomic regions on chromatin fibers (Fig. 4). Analysis at the nucleosomal level revealed that monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were preferentially and selectively enriched on the same nucleosome core particle in vivo. Collectively, these findings indicate that a trans-tail histone code exists in the mammalian nucleus whereby monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 occur on the same nucleosome to mark a distinct repressive chromatin state. To date, there are three other descriptions of trans-tail histone codes involving H2B ubiquitination and H3 Lys-4 methylation (37Dover J. Schneider J. Tawiah-Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28368-28371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 38Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) or H3 Lys-79 methylation (39Briggs S.D. Xiao T. Sun Z.W. Caldwell J.A. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D.F. Allis C.D. Strahl B.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 498Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 40Ng H.H. Xu R.M. Zhang Y. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34655-34657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) in yeast and another regarding trimethylation of H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 in mammals (12Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). We describe a unique transtail histone code involving monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 and demonstrate, for the first time, that the modifications occur on the same nucleosome in vivo. A recent study supports our conclusion of a monomethyl H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 trans-tail histone code (19Martens J.H. O'Sullivan R.J. Braunschweig U. Opravil S. Radolf M. Steinlein P. Jenuwein T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 800-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Examination of repetitive elements in mouse embryonic stem cells revealed specific patterns of enrichment for specific methyl modifications within different elements. The selective enrichment of both monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and monomethylated H3 Lys-9 was observed in SINE B1 elements, whereas the di- and trimethylated forms of H4 Lys-20 or H3 Lys-9 were not detected. Importantly, both monomethyl modifications were absent at satellite repeats and other retrotransposons, DNA and RNA transposons. Similar to our findings, this type of mutual enrichment and exclusion seemed to be observed only for monomethylation. Although trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 were both strongly enriched within satellite repeats, their degrees of enrichment varied greatly within other repetitive elements. For example, trimethylated H3 Lys-9 was enriched within DNA transposons where trimethylated H4 Lys-20 was lacking, and trimethylated H4 Lys-20 was enriched within retrotransposons and RNA transposons where trimethylated H3 Lys-9 was barely detected. This is consistent with our findings that there was a preferential targeting of trimethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 on chromatin fibers (Fig. 4C) and mononucleosomes (Fig. 5D) but that mono- and dimethylated H3 Lys-9 could also be detected, albeit to a far lesser extent. Despite these findings, recent evidence indicates that there is a trimethyl H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 trans-tail histone code operating specifically at pericentric heterochromatin (12Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). In this case, the lack of the Suv39h HMTs resulted in the expected loss of trimethylated H3 Lys-9 but also resulted in the unexpected loss of trimethylated H4 Lys-20 within pericentric regions. These findings indicate that the trimethylation of H4 Lys-20 is dependent upon the prior trimethylation of H3 Lys-9. Similarly, in yeast, the methylation of both H3 Lys-4 and Lys-79 are dependent upon the prior ubiquitination of H2B Lys-123 by Rad6 (37Dover J. Schneider J. Tawiah-Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 34655-34657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, in all reported cases regarding trans-tail histone codes, there is a defined unidirectional temporal sequence of modification events. We predict that, based on the model established for trimethylation, the monomethylation of H3 Lys-9 precedes monomethylation of H4 Lys-20, although this has yet to be experimentally determined. Although our findings define a novel trans-tail histone code associated with a distinct type of repressed chromatin, the exact biological function(s) of this phenomenon are currently unknown. The elucidation of the molecular players as well as the genomic targets of this pathway will be critical to understanding the importance of the monomethylated H4 Lys-20 and H3 Lys-9 trans-tail histone code.

In contrast to N-ɛ-acetyltransferases, the N-α-acetyltransferases transferring acetyl groups to the α-amino groups of protein N-termini have only been briefly described in mammalians. Human arrest defective 1 (hARD1), the only described human enzyme in this class, complexes with N-acetyltransferase human (NATH) and cotranslationally transfers acetyl groups to the N-termini of nascent polypeptides. Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of NATH and/or hARD1 triggers apoptosis in human cell lines. Knockdown of hARD1 also sensitized cells to daunorubicin-induced apoptosis, potentially pointing at the NATH–hARD1 acetyltransferase complex as a novel target for chemotherapy. Our results argue for an essential role of the NATH–hARD1 complex in cell survival and underscore the importance of protein N-α-acetylation in mammalian cells."

We observed pure rotational transitions of the water–hydroperoxy radical complex, H 2 O–HO 2 , in a supersonic jet by means of a Fourier transform microwave spectrometer combined with a double-resonance technique. The observed rotational transitions were found to split into two components because of the internal rotation of the water moiety. The molecular constants for the two components were determined precisely, supporting a molecular structure in which HO 2 acts as a proton donor to form a nearly planar five-membered ring, and one hydrogen atom of water sticks out from the ring plane. The structure and the spectral splittings due to internal rotation provide information on the nature of the bonding interaction between open- and closed-shell species, and they also provide accurate transition frequencies that are applicable to remote sensing of this complex, which may elucidate its potential roles in atmospheric and combustion chemistry."

Although parkin mRNA is expressed throughout the central nervous system, it is also prominently expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscle, tissues with sustained levels of protein turnover (1Kitada T.

Although Parkin can be found in both cytosolic and membrane-associated compartments of the cell, it has been localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane where it has been shown to protect against mitochondrial-dependent cell death (12Darios F. Corti O. Lucking C.B. Hampe C. Muriel M.P. Abbas N. Gu W.J. Hirsch E.C. Rooney T. Ruberg M. Brice A. Hum. Mol.

Thus, inactivation of parkin by P-element-mediated insertion caused degenerative changes and dysfunction involving the indirect flight muscles. Substantial mitochondrial abnormalities were found associated with this selective cell death. Similarly, Pesah et al. (14Pesah Y. Pham T. Burgess H. Middlebrooks B. Verstreken P. Zhou Y. Harding M.

Development. 2004; 131: 2183-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) showed that the absence of parkin in Drosophila led to an increased sensitivity to the mitochondria-specific stressor, paraquat, while also identifying ultrastructural alterations in skeletal muscle. These Drosophila studies suggested the possibility of an important role for parkin in the normal physiology of vertebrate skeletal muscle. The link between parkin function and mitochondrial performance was further strengthened by data from an unbiased proteomic approach that showed alterations in mitochondrial function in the ventral midbrain of parkin-null mice and revealed systemic changes due to oxidative stress (15Palacino J.J.

The pathologic hallmarks in affected muscle are intramyofibrillar inclusions bearing the β-amyloid peptide, as well as other fragments of the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), and cytoplasmic tubulofilaments, composed of hyperphosphorylated neurofilament and microtubule-associated tau proteins.

The relationship between βAPP, its amyloidogenic byproducts, and the proteasome-dependent degradation pathway has not yet been explored in IBM. Against this backdrop, we investigated the impact of the absence of parkin on β-amyloid-induced and mitochondria-directed toxic insults in cultured mouse primary skeletal muscle. Here, we report that primary myotubes from parkin-null mice show selective vulnerability to mitochondrial toxins and to β-amyloid peptide expression as compared with wild-type skeletal muscle cells; accordingly, we find that human Parkin overexpression affords added protection against these insults in normal muscle. Primary Muscle Culture—The generation of mice harboring a targeted germ line disruption of exon 3 of the parkin gene was described previously (28Goldberg M.S. Fleming S.M. Palacino J.J. Cepeda C. Lam H.A. Bhatnagar A. Meloni E.G. Wu N. Ackerson L.C. Klapstein G.J. Gajendiran M. Roth B.L. Chesselet M.F. Maidment N.T. Levine M.S. Shen J. J. Biol.

Hind limb muscle from parkin knock-out and wild-type newborn mice (postnatal day 1 to 2) was dissected, minced, and then trypsinized for 30 min at 37 °C. Trypsinized tissue was triturated in complete muscle growth medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium;1mm pyruvate; penicillin/streptomycin; 2 mm glutamine plus 20% fetal bovine serum). Following passage through a 70-μm filter, the cell suspension was preplated for 15 min on uncoated tissue culture dishes to allow for the adherence of fibroblasts, allowing for enrichment of the myoblast population in the cell suspension. Cells were counted and adjusted to 3 × 105/ml in muscle growth medium prior to plating on dishes precoated with Matrigel basement membrane preparation (BD Biosciences). Cultures were grown until confluent and the muscle induced to differentiate by switching to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% adult horse serum (muscle differentiation medium, MDM). Muscle cultures were used for various treatments as described under “Results.” Tissue culture medium and sera were from Invitrogen. Chemical Agents—A23187 (calcium ionophore), 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the mitochondrial toxins rotenone and carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) were purchased from Sigma. When myotube cultures were tested for sensitivity to H2O2, pyruvate-free medium was used in order to eliminate its peroxide-associated protective effects. Antibodies—Monoclonal antibody 6E10 against β-amyloid, and Prk8 against Parkin, were from Signet Pathology (Dedham, MA). Affinity-purified, rabbit anti-Parkin antibody HP2A was used as described previously (11Schlossmacher M.G. Frosch M.P. Gai W.P. Medina M. Sharma N. Forno L. Ochiishi T. Shimura H. Sharon R. Hattori N. Langston J.W. Mizuno Y. Hyman B.T. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1655-1667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Chicken anti-human myosin heavy chain antibody was purchased from Orbigen (San Diego, CA). Anti-βAPP (22C11) was from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody C8 against the C terminus of βAPP was a gift from Dr. Dennis Selkoe (Harvard Medical School). Monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (P4D1) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunofluorescence Staining—10-μm cryostat sections of skeletal muscle biopsies were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 20 min. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% normal goat serum and 0.4% bovine serum albumin (w/v) for 1 h. Antibodies were applied in the blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, sections were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch; West Grove, PA) in the blocking buffer. After final washes, samples were mounted in antifade solution and viewed using a Nikon TE200 epifluorescence microscope. Staining comparisons were made between IBM (n = 3, mean age 68 ± 10 years), polymyositis (PM) (n = 2, mean age 52 ± 16 years), and normal (n = 2, mean age 60 ± 14 years) skeletal muscle biopsies. To test antibody specificity, blocking experiments were performed with the immunogenic peptide used to raise the antiserum. Antibody solutions were preincubated for 1 h with either the immunogenic or an irrelevant control peptide at 100 μg/ml. The solution was centrifuged to remove any precipitate and the supernatant applied to the sections being analyzed. All other procedures were identical to those described above. Viral Vectors for Heterologous Gene Expression—Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-based vectors harboring full-length βAPP-751, the APP C-terminal fragment C100, and β-amyloid 1-42 (Aβ42) were prepared as described previously (20Querfurth H.W. Suhara T. Rosen K.M. McPhie D.L. Fujio Y. Tejada G. Neve R.L. Adelman L.S. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 793-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this study, C100 and C99 are used interchangeably. C100 specifically refers to an engineered cDNA with the open reading frame encoding the C99 fragment of βAPP that retains the methionine from position -1 relative to the sequence of Aβ. The C100 and Aβ constructs were engineered to contain an N-terminal signal peptide to direct their synthesis and processing through the secretory pathway, as would normally occur for βAPP. A doxycycline-inducible adenoviral expression construct containing Aβ42 (Ad-TRE-Aβ42) and adenovirus harboring the TetON positive regulator (Ad-TetON), which encodes the activator rtTA, were as described by Magrane et al. (29Magrane J. Smith R.C. Walsh K. Querfurth H.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 1700-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). For the HSV-based constructs, cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5 to 1 based on myoblast counts prior to differentiation. The adenoviruses were added at a 4:1 ratio of Ad-TRE-Aβ42 to AdTetON, to a total multiplicity of infection of 100-200, and expression was induced 24-48 h later by the addition of doxycycline (Sigma) to 1 μg/ml final concentration. Human wild-type Parkin containing an N-terminal Myc epitope tag was cloned alongside an internal cytomegalovirus promoter into the FUGW vector backbone. 4C. E. H. Moussa, V. Veereshwarayya, K. M. Rosen, G. Qin, and H. W. Querfurth, manuscript in preparation. The lentiviral constructs were packaged in human embryonic kidney 293FT cells with vesicular stomatitis virus as an envelope and the delta 8.9 plasmid, which contains genes for core proteins and enzymes, to reverse transcribe the lentiviral RNA genome after infection (30Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1624) Google Scholar). Lentiviral infection was performed (multiplicity of infection 5-10) 18 h prior to infection with Ad-TRE-Aβ42. Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay—Conditioned culture medium was clarified by centrifugation and lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity measured using the BioVision lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay kit (BioVision, Inc.; Mountain View, CA). Activity is determined by the conversion of lactate to pyruvate in the presence of the tetrazolium compound INT to produce a colored formazan. The reaction products were read using a Molecular Devices multiwell plate reader at a wavelength of 490 nm. 100-μl aliquots of test medium were assayed in triplicate for each treatment condition. Protein Extractions, Electrophoresis, and Western Blotting—For routine whole cell lysates, cultures were extracted with radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) plus protease inhibitors (Complete Protease Inhibitor; Roche Applied Science). To assess the amount of soluble versus insoluble Aβ in the muscle cultures, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped from the dish, and collected by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in a solution of 1% SDS containing protease inhibitors. After disruption by repeated pipetting, the mixture was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatant was removed and identified as “soluble.” The remaining pellet was triturated and then vortexed in a solution of 70% formic acid (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. The “insoluble” formic acid fraction was then neutralized by the addition of 1 m Tris-hydroxymethyl-aminomethane. Protein determinations were performed on diluted samples using the microscale version of the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. For Western blotting, proteins were electrophoretically separated and subsequently transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). After incubation with specific primary antibodies, blots were incubated with secondary antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (DAKO/Cytomation, Carpinteria, CA) and blots developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and film from Amersham Biosciences. For analysis of β-amyloid and C-terminal fragments of βAPP, samples were fractionated on 4-12% acrylamide Bis-Tris gels using MES running buffer. For other proteins, standard SDS-polyacrylamide gels were utilized. Histologic and immunochemical analyses of skeletal muscle biopsies from patients affected with IBM identify the presence of atrophic, vacuolated, and angulated myofibers that often contain intracytoplasmic inclusions consisting of the β-amyloid peptide, other proteolytic fragments of βAPP, and hyperphosphorylated neurofilament proteins and the microtubule-associated protein tau (31Askanas V. Engel W.K. Curr. Opin. Rheumatol. 1995; 7: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32Carpenter S. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 1105-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic inclusions also contain high levels of aggregated ubiquitin (24Askanas V. Serdaroglu P. Engel W.K. Alvarez R.B. Neurosci. Lett. 1991; 130: 73-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These characteristics together with the findings of high endogenous levels of expression of the Parkin gene in skeletal muscle and the colocalization of Parkin with Lewy bodies in Parkinson disease (11Schlossmacher M.G. Frosch M.P. Gai W.P. Medina M. Sharma N. Forno L. Ochiishi T. Shimura H. Sharon R. Hattori N. Langston J.W. Mizuno Y. Hyman B.T. Selkoe D.J. Kosik K.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1655-1667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), led us to examine human IBM biopsy material for the presence of Parkin reactivity. In muscle derived from IBM samples, but not from normal, age-matched specimens or those from polymyositis cases, affected myofibers were found to contain elevated levels of intramyofibrillar Parkin, as detected by immunoreactivity with antibody HP2A. This finding suggests that intracellular accumulation or aggregation of Parkin may also be a feature of this muscle disorder (Fig. 1). Examination of muscle biopsies from all samples indicated that Parkin expression is ubiquitous in skeletal muscle fibers, but only in the affected regions of IBM muscle biopsies was there a dramatic increase in the staining of some fibers. To establish antibody specificity, blocking experiments were performed where the antibody solution was preincubated with the immunizing peptide prior to their application. Preincubation with the immunizing peptide, but not the control peptide, led to a total elimination of parkin staining. Of note, the specificity of the HP2A antibody staining has also been recently confirmed in human brain specimens of a Parkin-mutant Parkinson disease case (33Pramstaller P.P. Schlossmacher M.G. Jacques T.S. Scaravilli F. Eskelson C. Pepivani I. Hedrich K. Adel S. Gonzales-McNeal M. Hilker R. Kramer P.L. Klein C. Ann. Neurol. 2005; 58: 411-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Co-accumulation of both Parkin and ubiquitin, and of β-amyloid together with ubiquitin, occurred in a significantly increased proportion of myofibers staining for either (χ2 = 47.4 and 90.8, respectively, p <0.05). Only IBM specimens showed intramyofiber Aβ deposition (data not shown, see Ref. 19Askanas V. McFerrin J. Alvarez R.B. Baque S. Engel W.K. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2155-2158Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Previous reports in mice and flies have indicated that the absence of parkin increases susceptibility to mitochondrial toxins and results in dysfunction of both muscle cells and spermatocytes (14Pesah Y.

After finding increased Parkin immunoreactivity in affected IBM skeletal myofibers, we examined the sensitivity of primary skeletal muscle cultures derived from either wild-type or parkin-null mice to the effects of both mitochondria-specific and other toxins. Primary myotube cultures were treated 3-5 days after the switch to differentiation medium, when mature, multinucleated, electrically active, contracting myotubes are numerous. To establish the sensitivity of these cells to non-mitochondrial toxins, we tested the effects of calcium ionophore (A23187) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cultures were incubated with increasing doses of these reagents for 24 h and the medium assayed for the release of lactate dehydrogenase. A comparison of muscle cultures derived from wild-type versus parkin knock-out mice showed no differential sensitivity to these toxic compounds over a range of several doses (Fig. 2). The response, however, was significantly different when cultures were tested for sensitivity to the mitochondrial toxins rotenone and CCCP, affecting complex 1 activity and electron transport coupling, respectively. In both cases, the absence of parkin led to a specific increase in muscle cell death to these inhibitors of mitochondrial-based oxidative phosphorylation (Fig. 2). Affected IBM muscle fibers contain substantial accumulations of β-amyloid, and we previously have shown that directed β-amyloid overexpression induces cell death in cultured skeletal muscle fibers (20Querfurth H.W. Suhara T. Rosen K.M. McPhie D.L. Fujio Y. Tejada G. Neve R.L. Adelman L.S. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 793-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The accumulation of β-amyloid, as well as Parkin, in IBM myofibers (Fig. 1) suggested that Parkin might act to directly or indirectly influence the capacity of the muscle to degrade fragments derived from βAPP processing (35Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, we infected primary muscle cultures derived from both parkin knock-out and wild-type mice with HSV-based constructs that target the expression of human holo-βAPP, of C100, and of Aβ42. Whole cell extracts were prepared 24 h after viral infection and examined by Western blot for expression of the transduced proteins (Fig. 3). Muscle cells lacking parkin (Fig. 3A) accumulate higher levels of both Aβ and the APP C-terminal fragment, C99, generated by β-secretase, compared with wild-type cells infected with the same constructs (Fig. 3B). The absence of murine parkin also leads to an increased accumulation of higher order oligomeric assemblies of β-amyloid in cells expressing Aβ42, i.e. dimers and trimers, forms that are regarded to be more toxic in vivo than the amyloid monomer alone (36Podlisny M.B.

Further evidence for the function of parkin and proteasomal activity in the regulation of Aβ is given as an increase in Aβ levels as well in the presence of proteasome inhibition (Fig. 3B, far right panel). In contrast, parkin-null muscle cultures infected with virus expressing holo-βAPP failed to show any increase in levels of the full-length holoprotein compared with wild-t"

The largest class of prenylated proteins contain a so-called CaaX motif at their carboxyl termini and are subject to a maturation process initiated by the attachment of an isoprenoid lipid by either protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) or protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I). Inhibitors of FTase, termed FTIs, have been the subject of intensive development in the past decade and have shown efficacy in clinical trials. Although GGTase-I inhibitors (GGTIs) have received less attention, accumulating evidence suggests GGTIs may augment therapies using FTIs and could be useful to treat a myriad of additional disease states. Here we describe the characterization of a selective, highly potent, and cell-active GGTase-I inhibitor, GGTI-DU40. Kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition by GGTI-DU40 is competitive with the protein substrate and uncompetitive with the isoprenoid substrate; the Ki for the inhibition is 0.8 nm. GGTI-DU40 is highly selective for GGTase-Iboth in vitro and in living cells. Studies indicate GGTI-DU40 blocks prenylation of a number of geranylgeranylated CaaX proteins. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with GGTI-DU40 inhibited thrombin-induced cell rounding via a process that involves inhibition of Rho proteins without significantly effecting parallel mobilization of calcium via Gβγ. These studies establish GGTI-DU40 as a prime tool for interrogating biologies associated with protein geranylgeranylation and define a novel structure for this emerging class of experimental therapeutics.

A promising strategy for the development of anti-cancer drugs is to suppress activation of oncogenic proteins such as Ras superfamily members. Functional Ras proteins require the addition of an isoprenoid lipid via a process directed by a carboxyl-terminal sequence termed the CaaX motif (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar, 2Cox A.D. Der C.J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2002; 2: 388-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), in which a cysteine (C) residue is followed by a dipeptide (aa) that is usually aliphatic and a variable residue (X) that dictates the prenyl group added. An Xaa residue of Ser, Met, Gln, Cys, or Ala directs the addition of the 15-carbon farnesyl lipid, whereas a Leu residue can direct modification by the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl isoprenoid (3Reid T.S.

The CaaX prenyltransferase protein farnesyltransferase (FTase) and protein geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase-I) (5Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol.

The prenyltransferase holoenzyme consists of an α subunit that is shared between the two forms of enzymes and a distinct β subunit that binds substrates and thereby also confers prenyl group specificity (1Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). FTase substrates include Ras GTPases, nuclear lamins, several protein kinases, and phosphatases, as well as other regulatory proteins (5Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol.

GGTase-I substrates include Rac and Rho GTPases and the γ subunits of most heterotrimeric G-proteins (6Sebti S.M. Hamilton A.D. Expert Opin. Investig.

The major effort in this regard has been development of FTase inhibitors termed FTIs. FTIs developed rapidly from early CaaX peptide mimics (10Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Paris K.J. Burnier J.P. Marsters Jr., J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8313-8316Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) into the small organic ligands that have now shown efficacy in clinical trials, particularly hematologic and breast cancers (11Karp J.E.

FTI development was unusually rapid, as multiple groups developed structurally distinct drugs that all demonstrated similar biological/pharmacological properties in preclinical models and unambiguously indicated that drug action was due principally to the inhibition of FTase. These results, however, have been overshadowed by unexpected clinical shortcomings, particularly against solid tumors (13Smith V. Rowlands M.G. Barrie E. Workman P. Kelland L.R. Clin.

One postulated explanation for this clinical limitation is the increased geranylgeranylation of protein such as K-Ras when FTase activity is inhibited, a process referred to as alternate prenylation (15Rowell C.A.

Chem. 2005; 13: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Studies with these compounds have revealed a number of consequences of cellular exposure to a GGTI. Administration of GGTI to cells can cause cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, and this effect appears to be mediated by inactivation of CDK2/4 through the p21/p15 kinase inhibitors downstream of Rho (21Vogt A.

The complex nature of CaaX protein localization and function leaves multiple points where dysregulation can occur, and therefore multiple points for therapeutic intervention are possible. Although the efficacy of prenyltransferase inhibitors in treating cancer is now considered quite genuine, if still against a limited number of cancers, the rational application of protein prenyltransferase inhibitors is growing more complex as the roles for multiple GTPases and other CaaX-containing proteins are elucidated. To aid in these areas of understanding, we now describe the characterization of a novel pyrazole-derived GGTI termed GGTI-DU40. GGTI-DU40 has the encouraging features of being highly selective for GGTase-I, high affinity, and cell-active. These characteristics make GGTI-DU40 desirable as a means to control protein GGTase-I activity and thereby provide a useful tool to assess the biology of geranylgeranylated proteins. GGTI-DU40 is a promising lead compound for therapeutic development-targeting pathologies dependent on geranylgeranylated proteins. Materials—Farnesyl diphosphate(FPP) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate(GGPP) were purchased from Biomol, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). AdoMet was purchased from Sigma. [3H]GGPP, [3H]FPP, and [3H]AdoMet were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Geneticin was purchased from Invitrogen. The FTI L-744,832 was purchased from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Streptavidin-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Biosciences AB (Uppsla Sweden). Biotin-S-farnsyl-l-cysteine was synthesized and purified as previously described (27Baron R.A. Casey P.J. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). GGTI-DU40 and its inactive analog, SN-DU40, were synthesized by PPD Discovery (Research Triangle Park, NC) and by the Duke Small Molecule Synthesis Facility; the preparation of these compounds will be described elsewhere. Enzyme Assays—FTase and GGTase-I activities were determined by the following incorporation of radiolabeled isoprenoid from 3H-FPP and 3H-GGPP into Ras proteins as described previously (28Thissen J.A. Casey P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 243: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified mammalian FTase or GGTase-I (50 ng, expressed in Sf9 cells) (29Zhang F.L. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23465-23470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were used to initiate reactions containing 0.5 μm FPP or GGPP, respectively, and a concentration of 1 μm appropriately purified His-tagged Ras substrates (H-Ras for FTase; Ras-CVLL for GGTase-I). Where indicated in the appropriate figure legend, inhibitors were added at the indicated concentrations. Final Me2SO concentration was 2% for all samples. Reactions were carried out for 10 min at 30 °C before precipitation and product determination. Kinetic assays in which the GGPP concentration was varied employed 5 ng of GGTase-I, and reactions were carried out for 5 min to prevent GGTase-I concentration from exceeding GGPP concentration. GGTase-II activity was measured using bovine brain cytosol (200 μg of protein) as the enzyme source and purified GST-tagged Rab5a as the protein substrate. The pGEX-Rab5a construct was a gift from Adrienne Cox (University of North Carolina). The assay was performed identically to that described above for the CaaX prenyltransferases, except for the enzyme source and protein substrate and the reaction time was increased to 30 min. Icmt assays were performed as described previously (27Baron R.A. Casey P.J. BMC Biochem. 2004; 5: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed using biotin-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (4 μm) as a substrate and [3H]AdoMet (5 μm, 7.5 Ci/mmol) as a methyl donor. The reactions were initiated by the addition of Sf9 membranes containing recombinant human Icmt (2 μg of total protein) in the presence and absence of inhibitors. The reactions were carried out at room temperature for 20 min and product formation determined. Cell Culture and Microscopy—MDCK cells stably expressing GFP-H-Ras were a gift from Mark Philips (New York University School of Medicine). Ras-CVLL was cloned into pEGFP (Clontech) and used to transfect MDCK cells. Stable clones were then selected using both Geneticin and expression confirmed by analysis of GFP expression as visualized by fluorescence microscopy. MDCK cells were always cultured as a monolayer in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. For drug treatment experiments, the cells were plated onto glass-bottomed microwell dishes (MatTek Corp, Ashland, MA) and experiments initiated ∼24 h after cells reached confluence. All compounds tested were dissolved in Me2SO and added to cells at a final Me2SO concentration of 0.02%. For the experiments assessing thrombin effects on cell morphology, MDA-MB-231 cells were plated onto glass-bottomed microwell dishes at 10–20% confluence and grown for 18–24 h in the presence of serum. The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and the medium replaced with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) including the indicated compounds and incubated an additional 24 h. The cells were then imaged, treated with thrombin (1 unit/ml for 20 min), and imaged again. Assessment of receptor-independent cell rounding was accomplished using adenovirus expressing the activated mutant of Gα12, Gα12QL (31Meigs T.E. Fedor-Chaiken M. Kaplan D.D. Brackenbury R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24594-24600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were plated onto glass-bottomed microwell dishes at 60% confluence and grown for 18–24 h in the presence of serum. The cells were then washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and medium replaced with serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) including any indicated compounds and incubated 6 h before the addition of recombinant adenovirus. Following an additional 12 h of incubation, the cells were imaged using bright field and GFP fluorescence microscopy. Cell images were acquired using an Eclipse TE300 microscope (Nikon) using either an oil immersion lens at 600× (for fluorescence of MDCK cells) or a plan fluor lens at 200× (for MBA-321 cells) and a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Sterling Heights, MI) employing SPOT RT version 3.02 software. Calcium Mobilization Studies—For the experiments assessing thrombin-induced calcium flux, MDA-MB-231 were plated on glass coverslips and treated in a similar manner to that described for the thrombin-rounding experiments. Calcium flux was measured 24 h after withdrawal of the serum and the addition of inhibitors using the calcium-sensitive dye Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc.) (32Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MDA-MB-231 cells were dye-loaded for 1 h with 2.5 μm Fura-2/AM in Hanks' balanced salt solution (supplemented with 10 mm glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). After dye loading, the coverslips were placed in a temperature-controlled recording chamber and superfused with Hanks' solution. The cells were excited alternately at 340 and 380 nm, and fluorescence emission at 510 nm was measured every 4 s during the course of each experiment. After base-line recording for 2 min, thrombin (1 unit/ml) was superfused into the bath chamber for 1 min (∼20 ml) followed by washout. Data are presented after base-line subtraction to show thrombin-dependent calcium flux. Fluorescence measurements were acquired using a DeltaScan Illumination System (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) running on FELIX version 1.4 software. Gβγ Membrane Partitioning—MDA-MB-231 cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and treated exactly as in the thrombin cell-rounding assay. Following drug treatment in serum-free medium, cells were harvested and lysed using ice-cold hypotonic lysis buffer (70 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors). Following sonication, the whole cell lysate (75 μg protein) was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min. Both the supernatant (S100) and pellet (P100) fractions were processed on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblot analysis. RhoGDI-Rho Interaction Assay—The interaction of GST-RhoGDI with endogenous Rho was assessed by protein interaction experiments. RhoGDI was generated as a glutathione-S-transferase fusion protein using a construct provided by Gary Bokoch (Scripps). The GST-RhoGDI fusion protein was incubated with treated MDA-MB-231 cell lysates (prepared identically to Gβγ partitioning above) for 1 h at 4 °Cin a total volume of 200 μl. Glutathione-Sepharose was added and the mixture rotated at 4 °C for 30 min, after which the affinity matrix was pelleted and washed three times with 500 μl of incubation buffer (70 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 100 μm GDP, and 2mm MgCl2). Proteins retained on the matrix were solubilized in 2× Laemmli loading buffer and separated by electrophoresis on denaturing, 4–20% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with an anti-RhoA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-179). Unprenylated Rap1 Analysis—To measure the levels of unprenylated Rap1 in cells, whole cell lysates of MDA-MB-231 cells (prepared identically to Gβγ partitioning above, 75 ug) were mixed with Laemmli loading buffer and boiled. Samples were then separated by electrophoresis on denaturing 4–20% polyacrylamide gels and proteins transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for immunoblotting with antisera specific for the unprenylated form of Rap1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-1482, goat). Sample loading was verified by reprobing the blots with antisera for total Rap1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology catalog number sc-65, rabbit). Miscellaneous Methods—Graphing and curve fitting were performed using Prism (GraphPad, San Diego CA). Substrate velocity curves were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation, whereas double reciprocal plots were fit using linear regression. The Ki for GGTI-DU40 was calculated using nonlinear regression and shared parameter curve fitting for all inhibitor concentrations. The velocity equation used was v = Vmax[S]/(Km(1 + ([I]/Ki)) + [S]). Identification of GGTI-DU40, a Potent Inhibitor of GGTase-I—A diverse chemical library was screened for GGTase-I inhibitors using an in vitro assay, and a novel pyrazole-based inhibitor with an IC50 of ∼10 μm was discovered. Medicinal chemists at PPD Discovery (Research Triangle Park, NC) then optimized this structure for potency. The result of this optimization was a novel compound that we have dubbed GGTI-DU40 (Fig. 1A, N-[(S)-1-carbamoyl-2-phenylethyl]-4-[2-(3,4-di-chlorophenyl)-4-(2-methylsulfanylethyl)-5-pyridin-3-yl-2-H-pyrazol-3-yloxy]butyramide). The medicinal chemistry route to the refinement of this compound will be reported separately. 3J.P. Strachen et al., manuscript in preparation. Kinetic Analysis of GGTase-I Inhibition by GGTI-DU4—In an initial examination of the selectivity of GGTI-DU40, the ability of the compound to inhibit GGTase-I and other enzymes in the prenylation pathway was determined (Fig. 1B). GGTI-DU40 was a highly potent inhibitor of purified GGTase-I exhibiting an IC50 of 8.24 ± 0.97 nm. GGTI-DU40 inhibition of FTase was barely detectable in the concentration range tested, exhibiting an IC50 for this closely related enzyme of >2 μm, corresponding to a FTase/GGTase-I selectivity ratio of >250. GGTI-DU40 showed no detectable activity against GGTase-II (Rab geranylgeranyltransferase) nor against Icmt methyltransferase (Fig. 1B). These data indicate GGTI-DU40 is a highly potent and selective inhibitor of GGTase-I. A structural analog of GGTI-DU40, SN-DU40, which contains a single sulfur-to-nitrogen substitution (Fig. 1A), was also tested for GGTase-I inhibition. This single substitution resulted in a compound with an IC50 of >2 μm for GGTase-I, providing a useful control for confirming the mechanism-based effects of GGTI-DU40 in cells (see below). GGTI-DU40 is of a more distinct structural class than all of the other reported protein prenyltransferase inhibitors. Hence, it was considered important to understand the mechanism of GGTase-I inhibition by this compound. Accordingly, we undertook Michaelis-Menten-type analysis of the inhibition of GGTase-I. These kinetic data revealed that GGTI-DU40 is a competitive inhibitor with respect to the protein substrate (Fig. 2, A and C) and an uncompetitive inhibitor with respect to GGPP (Fig. 2, B and D). Hence, GGTI-DU40 competes for binding of the protein substrate but not the isoprenoid substrate of GGTase-I. This feature likely contributes to the high selectivity of this compound for GGTase-I. Analysis of the protein substrate competition data confirmed the high affinity of GGTI-DU40; the resultant calculated Ki was 0.78 ± 0.10 nm. Given this high affinity, we tested GGTI-DU40 for potential time-dependent inhibition of GGTase-I, but no such behavior was observed (data not shown). These data establish GGTI-DU40 as a novel high affinity structure targeting the CaaX binding site of a protein prenyltransferase. Cellular Activity of GGTI-DU4—Because GGTI-DU40 demonstrated favorable properties as a GGTase-I inhibitor in vitro, we explored its utility in targeting this enzyme in cells. An amenable system to evaluate the cellular effects of protein prenyltransferase inhibitors utilizes subcellular distribution of fluorescently tagged fusions of Ras proteins. Wild-type H-Ras normally localizes to the plasma membrane because of its ability to be modified by FTase followed by processing by Rce1 and Icmt at its carboxyl-terminal sequence CVLS. A variant of H-Ras, Ras-CVLL, contains a CaaX sequence terminating in Leu, and thus its processing is initiated by geranylgeranylation by GGTase-I. In stably transfected MDCK cells treated with either the vehicle Me2SO (data not shown) or the inactive GGTI-DU40 analog SN-DU40, both H-Ras and Ras-CVLL are predominantly localized to the plasma membrane (Fig. 3, A and B). Treatment with the FTI inhibitor L-744,832 (33Sepp-Lorenzino L. Ma Z. Rands E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Rosen N. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 5302-5309PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in almost complete mislocalization of H-Ras (Fig. 3C), but no detectable mislocalization of Ras-CVLL was observed even at the highest concentration tested (20 μm, Fig. 3D), indicating the Ras-CVLL construct is exclusively geranylgeranylated in cells. On the other hand, treatment with GGTI-DU40 resulted in complete mislocalization of Ras-CVLL such that plasma membrane-localized Ras was barely detectable (Fig. 3F), whereas this compound was without an effect on localization of H-Ras (Fig. 3E). Ras-CVLL mislocalization by GGTI-DU40 treatment could be detected at inhibitor concentrations as low as 2 μm (data not shown). Consequences of GGTI-DU40 Treatment on Cell Signaling—To further evaluate the effects of GGTase-I inhibition in cells, we chose the MDA-MB-231 adenocarcinoma cell line because of its established biology (34Majumdar M. Seasholtz T.M. Buckmaster C. Toksoz D. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26815-26821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 35Meigs T.E. Juneja J. DeMarco C.T.

In initial studies, the ability of GGTI-DU40 treatment to impact the prenylation of a known geranylgeranylated protein was assessed using an antibody specific for the unprenylated form of Rap1. Upon GGTI-DU40 treatment of the MD-MBA-231 cells, a dose-dependent increase in the level of unmodified Rap1 was observed (Fig. 4A). As expected, the administration of FTI L-744,832 had no effect on Rap1 prenylation status. These data indicated the capacity of GGTI-DU40 to inhibit prenylation of endogenous proteins. We next addressed whether GGTI administration could block the normal functions of prenylated proteins. An attractive model here involves Rho GTPases. A major class of proteins that directly associates with Rho proteins in cells is termed RhoGDI, and its binding to Rho GTPases is via an interaction that is known to be prenylation-dependent (37Scheffzek K. Stephan I. Jensen O.N. Illenberger D. Gierschik P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Hence, we assessed the ability of GGTI-DU40 treatment of cells to impact on the ability of endogenous Rho proteins to bind RhoGDI. This interaction was directly measured in MDA-MB-231 cells using a GST-RhoGDI pull-down approach to assess the relative amount of endogenous Rho that was able to interact with RhoGDI after inhibitor treatment. As seen in Fig. 4B, a 24-h treatment of the cells with GGTI-DU40 led to an almost complete loss in the ability of Rho proteins to associate with RhoGDI; this is precisely what would be expected if geranylgeranylation of Rho was blocked. In contrast, treatment of the cells with the FTI had no effect on the ability of Rho to interact with RhoGDI (Fig. 4B). Signaling through the thrombin receptor in MDA-MB-231 cells results in a cell-rounding phenotype that is principally mediated via the Rho GTPase (35Meigs T.E. Juneja J. DeMarco C.T. Stemmle L.N.

https://openalex.org/W2072508159,"Keratinocyte differentiation and stratification are complex processes involving multiple signaling pathways, which convert a basal proliferative cell into an inviable rigid squame. Loss of attachment to the basement membrane triggers keratinocyte differentiation, while in other epithelial cells, detachment from the extracellular matrix leads to rapid programmed cell death or anoikis. The potential role of AKT in providing a survival signal necessary for stratification and differentiation of primary human keratinocytes was investigated. AKT activity increased during keratinocyte differentiation and was attributed to the specific activation of AKT1 and AKT2. Targeted reduction of AKT1 expression, but not AKT2, by RNA interference resulted in an abnormal epidermis in organotypic skin cultures with a thin parabasal region and a pronounced but disorganized cornified layer. This abnormal stratification was due to significant cell death in the suprabasal layers and was alleviated by caspase inhibition. Normal expression patterns of both early and late markers of keratinocyte differentiation were also disrupted, producing a poorly developed stratum corneum. Keratinocyte differentiation and stratification are complex processes involving multiple signaling pathways, which convert a basal proliferative cell into an inviable rigid squame.

This abnormal stratification was due to significant cell death in the suprabasal layers and was alleviated by caspase inhibition. Normal expression patterns of both early and late markers of keratinocyte differentiation were also disrupted, producing a poorly developed stratum corneum. The keratinocyte is the major cellular constituent of human epidermis, which through a carefully orchestrated process of growth arrest and differentiation, provides a stratified protective barrier responsible for fluid balance and evasion of infection (1Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). During normal differentiation, an uncommitted stem cell yields transit amplifying cells, which divide a limited number of times and, subsequently, exit the cell cycle, detach from the basement membrane, and begin expression of proteins required for production of the cornified envelope (2Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar, 3Watt F.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3919-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). The fully developed epidermis has at least four histologically distinct layers: the innermost basal layer containing undifferentiated stem cells and proliferative transit amplifying cells, the suprabasal spinous layer highlighted by increased cell-to-cell contacts, a granular layer marked by the presence of granules containing proteins required for formation of the final layer, the stratum corneum. Contributions from each layer ensure the structural integrity of mature skin.Despite detachment from the basement membrane and loss of integrin contacts, which is a potent apoptotic stimulus in most epithelial cells (4Frisch S.M. Ruoslahti E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar), the keratinocyte remains viable and metabolically active until reaching the interface of the granular and cornified layers, a region called the transition zone. At the transition zone, the keratinocyte undergoes a specialized form of cell death similar to apoptosis but lacking many key morphological features normally associated with programmed cell death (5Gandarillas A. Goldsmith L.A. Gschmeissner S. Leigh I.M. Watt F.M. Exp. Dermatol. 1999; 8: 71-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). It is estimated that it may take the cell 2 weeks to reach this point, during which time the cell expresses and assembles the proteins required for cornified envelope formation (1Eckert R.L. Crish J.F. Robinson N.A. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 397-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Thus, the keratinocyte is a specialized epithelial cell that contains an innate anchorage independent survival mechanism necessary for suprabasal viability and stratification.Normal epidermal development and homeostasis require multiple signaling pathways that act sequentially and in parallel in an “integrated” control system to govern the balance between proliferation and differentiation (6Dotto G.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Developmental cues stem from both the Notch and Wnt gene families, which regulate commitment (2Fuchs E. Raghavan S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase/Ras/Rho pathways have been shown to play a role in expression of differentiation specific proteins (6Dotto G.P. Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. 1999; 10: 442-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), while certain isoforms of the transcription factor p63 appear to control commitment to stratification (7Koster M.I. Kim S. Mills A.A. DeMayo F.J. Roop D.R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 126-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). However, very little is known about survival signaling required for the stratification process.AKT, or protein kinase B, is a predominantly cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase, which acts as a major downstream effector of insulin and growth factor receptor signaling and a regulator of cell attachment. Upon activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) 2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; HKGS, human keratinocyte growth supplement; IPK, immunoprecipitation kinase; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; DM, differentiation medium; BM, basal medium; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; sh, small hairpin. 2The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase-3; HKGS, human keratinocyte growth supplement; IPK, immunoprecipitation kinase; PDK, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase; pRb, retinoblastoma protein; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl dUTP nick end labeling; EGF, epidermal growth factor; IGF, insulin-like growth factor; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; DM, differentiation medium; BM, basal medium; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; sh, small hairpin. and the subsequent generation of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, AKT, as well as its upstream regulator phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), become colocalized at the membrane due to the binding of their pleckstrin homology domains to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Once localized to the membrane, AKT is activated through phosphorylation of two main regulatory sites located in the catalytic T-loop (Thr308) and the hydrophobic pocket (Ser473). PDK1 is responsible for phosphorylation of Thr308, while the kinase (or kinases), which phosphorylates Ser473, designated as PDK2, is still under investigation but most likely is due to the richtor-mTOR complex (8Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40406-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 9Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). Once activated, AKT translocates to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, where it in turn activates a variety of substrates in both of these compartments. The diversity of reported AKT substrates corroborates the essential role of AKT in cellular processes as diverse as glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, cell growth, cell cycle regulation, cell death, and differentiation.AKT activity has been implicated in controlling differentiation of various tissues in mice including muscle, adipose tissue, bone, and skin (10Peng X.D. Xu P.Z. Chen M.L. Hahn-Windgassen A. Skeen J. Jacobs J. Sundararajan D. Chen W.S. Crawford S.E. Coleman K.G. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1352-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). While the predominant function of AKT signaling in muscle differentiation appears to be the regulation of muscle-specific transcription factors, some reports indicate AKT function in the postmitotic survival of myocytes required for terminal differentiation and myotube formation (11Jiang B.H.

Whether a similar survival function of AKT exists in keratinocyte terminal differentiation is not known. Using RNA interference in combination with organotypic culture, the importance of AKT activity in human keratinocyte differentiation and skin formation was assessed in the work presented here.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Total AKT (9272), p-473 (9271), p-473 for IFA (9277), p-308 (9275), p-GSK3 (9331), GSK3 (9332) antibodies and LY294002 and GSK-3 fusion protein were from Cell Signaling Technology. AKT1 (B-1), AKT2 (F-7), AKT3 (C-14), NF-κB p65 (F-6), TRAF-2 (C-20), actin (C-2), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Keratin 1 and keratin 10 antibodies were from Covance, filaggrin antibodies (BT-576) were from Biomedical Technologies Inc., and caspase 14 antibodies (8-1-71) were from Upstate Biotechnology. EGF, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and a control fluoromethyl ketone (fmk)-derivitized peptide against cathepsins B and L (Z-FA-fmk) were from R&D Systems. The general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was from Bachem.Keratinocyte Cell Culture and Differentiation—Primary human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins and passaged in Epilife Medium (Cascade Biologics) with human keratinocyte growth supplement (HKGS). Keratinocytes from at least three donors were pooled for each experiment and used up to the sixth passage. For calcium-mediated differentiation, freshly confluent keratinocytes were fed Epilife Medium without HKGS (basal medium (BM)) for 12 h and were then treated with 1.5 mm calcium in Epilife Medium without HKGS (differentiation medium (DM)) for the indicated times. For suspension-induced differentiation, subconfluent keratinocytes were fed Epilife Medium without HKGS for 12 h, trypsinized, and suspended in medium containing 1.5% methylcellulose (Sigma).In vitro skin reconstitution (organotypic culture) was performed using keratinocytes cultured in serum with a fibroblast feeder layer (15McCance D.J. Kopan R. Fuchs E. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were seeded with mitomycin C (Sigma)-treated 3T3-Swiss albino cells (ATCC CCL-92) and fed with E-medium (DMEM: Ham's 3:1, 5 μg/ml insulin, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 1.8 × 10-4 adenine, 2 × 10-10 triiodothyronine, 10% fetal bovine serum, 10-10 m cholera toxin, and 10 ng/ml EGF). Keratinocytes were then seeded on a collagen matrix (rat tail Type I; BD Biosciences) containing 3.75 × 105 3T3 cells/ml, submerged in E-medium. Once cells formed a confluent monolayer, the matrix was raised to the air: medium interface and the organotypic culture was fed from below with E-medium without cholera toxin and EGF every other day for 14 days.For caspase inhibition experiments, 100 μm Z-VAD-fmk or Z-FA-fmk were added to the culture medium at the time the cultures were raised to the air:medium interface and included at the same concentration at each refeeding.Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation Kinase (IPK) Assay—For immunoblot analysis of endogenous proteins, cells were lysed in 8 m urea, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, supplemented with AEBSF and aprotinin. Typically 50 μg of total protein was added per lane of a SDS-PAGE gel. Lysates for IPK assays were prepared with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). Lysates containing 500 μg of protein were immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of total AKT or isoform specific AKT antibody and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). The washed precipitate was resuspended in kinase buffer containing 25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4 and 10 mm MgCl2 with 200 μm ATP and 100 nm GSK3 fusion protein as a substrate in a volume of 40 μl. Kinase reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 1 h and terminated by addition of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Phospho-GSK3 was detected by immunoblot.RNA Interference—For stable RNA interference, the following target sequences were used to produce pSUPER.puro retroviral vectors (OligoEngine) according to the manufacturer's instructions: shAKT1, 5′-ggacgggcacattaagatctt-3′; shAKT2, 5′-gaagtggcggtcagcaagg-3′; shSCRAM, a non-coding sequence generated by OligoEngine software. The vectors were cotransfected with pHCMV-VSV-G into phoenix-gp cells by the calcium phosphate method (BD Biosciences). AKT1/AKT2 dual knockdown was accomplished by cotransfecting shAKT1 and shAKT2 into phoenix-gp cells. After 48 h, supernatants were concentrated by centrifuging for 90 min at 12,000 × g, 4 °C. First passage primary human keratinocyte cultures were infected for 6 h in a humidified 37 °C incubator, 5% CO2, in the presence of 8 μg/ml polybrene. After 18 h of recovery, cells were selected with 1.25 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days and allowed to recover for an additional 2 days. Transduction efficiency was typically 30-50% as assessed by pBabe-GFP control infection.For transient RNA interference, the following target sequences were used to produce pBS/U6 constructs: pBS/U6/AKT1, 5′-ggccgcaggatgtggacc-3′; pBS/U6/AKT2, 5′-gccccaggcgaggacccc-3′; pBS/U6/luc, 5′-acaagacaattgcactga-3′ (targeting luciferase as a control). The vectors were transfected into early passage primary human keratinocytes using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) at a transfection reagent: DNA ratio of 3:1.Microscopy—Tissue embedding, hematoxylin and eosin and Ki-67 staining were performed by the University of Rochester Medical Center Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. Five-micrometerthick paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized/rehydrated and treated with boiling citrate buffer for 10 min. Indirect immunofluorescent staining was performed at ambient temperature using the indicated primary antibodies and Alexa-488-conjugated secondary reagents (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% Triton X-100 and 3% bovine serum albumin. Sections were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent (Molecular Probes). Images were captured using a Leica DM IRB microscope equipped with either a 10× (0.3 NA) or 20× (0.4 NA) Plan-Fluotar objective and a PCO SensicamQE CCD camera controlled with Image ProPlus 5.0 software. In addition, an RGB tunable imaging filter (Cambridge Research & Instrumentation, Inc.) was used to collect bright field color images. Exposure times were kept constant within an experiment, images were psuedocolored, and no additional image modification was performed.Fluorescein-cadaverine Uptake—For transglutaminase assay experiments, 100 μm fluorescein-cadaverine or unmodified fluorescein (Molecular Probes) was added to the medium of 13.75 day old organotypic cultures. The cultures were harvested 6 h after addition as suggested by Mack et al. (16Mack J.A. Li L. Sato N. Hascall V.C. Maytin E.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29904-29911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Deparaffinized sections were rehydrated and mounted with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-supplemented ProLong Gold antifade reagent.TUNEL Assays—The in situ cell death detection kit (fluorescein) from Roche Applied Science was used essentially as described by the manufacturer's instructions. For TUNEL analysis by flow cytometry, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at ambient temperature with shaking. Cells were permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate for 10 min, and data were collected on a FACS Elite (Coulter). For sections, deparaffinized slides were permeablized with the same buffer for 10 min without heating. Images were captured by fluorescence microscopy as described above.RESULTSAKT Activity Increases during Keratinocyte Differentiation—Differentiation-specific activation of AKT has been detected in various cell types including myocytes and adipocytes (13Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 17Altomare D.A. Lyons G.E. Mitsuuchi Y. Cheng J.Q. Testa J.R. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2407-2411Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To examine AKT activity in differentiating primary human keratinocytes, two different in vitro methods of stimulating differentiation were used and included calcium treatment and suspension culture. Following growth to confluence, addition of calcium-containing DM induced differentiation of keratinocytes as assessed by immunoblotting for keratin 1, an early marker of differentiation (Fig. 1A). While AKT protein level remained constant throughout 36 h of differentiation, the level of activated AKT increased significantly, as assessed by immunoblot for phosphorylated serine 473 (p-473). The level of phosphorylation at threonine 308 (p-308) remained constant, indicating that the putative PDK2, not PDK1, is regulated by keratinocyte differentiation. Further examination of AKT activity during calcium-stimulated keratinocyte differentiation was accessed by IPK assay using purified GSK3 fusion protein as a substrate. Following 24 h of treatment in DM, AKT activity increased, while cells in BM maintained low AKT kinase activity (Fig. 1B) indicating that the increase in AKT activity is specific to calcium-induced differentiation.As an alternative means of inducing differentiation, keratinocytes were subjected to suspension culture in 1.5% methylcellulose, and AKT activity was assessed by IPK assay. Despite a modest reduction in AKT expression over 32 h of suspension culture, AKT activity increased significantly (Fig. 1C). Increased AKT activity has been observed previously after suspension-induced differentiation of keratinocytes in a similar time frame (18Janes S.M. Ofstad T.A. Campbell D.H. Watt F.M. Prowse D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4157-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, AKT activity increases as a result of two mechanistically independent methods of keratinocyte differentiation suggesting AKT activation is a general requirement for this process.To determine whether the increased AKT activity seen in vitro correlates with what occurs in vivo, we performed indirect immunofluorescent staining for active AKT (p-473) on paraffin embedded sections of human skin and organotypic cultures (described below). Active AKT was present in the basal and suprabasal layers (Fig. 1D) similar to results reported for murine and human reconstituted skin (18Janes S.M. Ofstad T.A. Campbell D.H. Watt F.M. Prowse D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4157-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Calautti E. Li J. Saoncella S. Brissette J.L. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32856-32865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).AKT exists in at least three isoforms in mammalian cells, however, the expression of each varies depending on the tissue (20Datta S.R. Brunet A. Greenberg M.E. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2905-2927Crossref PubMed Scopus (3704) Google Scholar). While each isoform has been shown to equally respond to agonists such as plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) and EGF, specific physiological roles have been attributed to individual isoforms (21Chen W.S. Xu P.Z. Gottlob K. Chen M.L. Sokol K. Shiyanova T. Roninson I. Weng W. Suzuki R. Tobe K. Kadowaki T. Hay N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2203-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar, 22Cho H. Mu J. Kim J.K. Thorvaldsen J.L. Chu Q. Crenshaw 3rd, E.B. Kaestner K.H. Bartolomei M.S. Shulman G.I. Birnbaum M.J. Science. 2001; 292: 1728-1731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar). Thus, isoform-specific immunoprecipitations were performed to assess the activation of each in keratinocyte differentiation. Primary human keratinocytes express all three isoforms as detected by isoform-specific immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot with a pan-AKT antibody (total AKT; Fig. 2A). Two alternatively spliced forms of AKT3 were detected by immunoprecipitation as reported previously (23Nakatani K. Sakaue H. Thompson D.A. Weigel R.J. Roth R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 906-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar); however, four times the amount of lysate was needed to produce the levels shown here. Therefore, AKT3 levels were low and were not examined further. After treatment of confluent keratinocytes with calcium to induce differentiation, expression levels of AKT1 and AKT2 were determined by immunoblot. A modest increase in AKT2 24 h after induction was observed, while AKT1 expression remained constant throughout the course of the experiment (Fig. 2B). Differentiation-specific transcriptional events may lead to induction of AKT2 expression similar to what has been observed in muscle (12Kaneko S. Feldman R.I. Yu L. Wu Z. Gritsko T. Shelley S.A.

Commun. 1998; 251: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Isoform-specific activation of AKT during keratinocyte differentiation. A, whole cell lysate from proliferating keratinocytes (500 μg of total protein for AKT1 and AKT2; 2000 μg for AKT3) was immunoprecipitated with isoform-specific AKT antibodies, and the washed precipitates were immunoblotted with a pan AKT antibody (total AKT). B, keratinocytes were grown to confluence and then treated with calcium to induce differentiation. Lysates were taken at the indicated times and analyzed for AKT1 and AKT2 by immunoblot using isoform-specific antibodies. C, to demonstrate detection of isoform specific kinase activity, quiescent keratinocytes were treated with (+) or without (-) 100 ng/ml IGF-1 and 20 ng/ml EGF for 15 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with isoform-specific antibodies, and the washed precipitates were used for kinase assays. D, Akt isoform-specific IPK assay from confluent (0 h) and calcium-differentiated (24 h) keratinocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To determine which isoform contributed to the increased AKT activity observed during differentiation, isoform-specific IPK assays were performed. As a positive control, keratinocytes were treated with EGF and IGF-1, resulting in a detectable increase in activity of each isoform (Fig. 2C). Both AKT1 and AKT2 activities were consistently elevated after 24 h of calcium treatment (Fig. 2D) suggesting both isoforms become active during keratinocyte differentiation.AKT Inhibition by RNA Interference Results in Altered Epithelial Stratification—While both calcium treatment and suspension culture initiate aspects of the keratinocyte transcriptional differentiation program, neither completely mimics the spatio-temporal cell biological changes observed during stratification in vivo. Organotypic culture of human keratinocytes provides a unique opportunity to perform genetic analysis of human epithelial stratification using both normal and engineered keratinocytes (15McCance D.J. Kopan R. Fuchs E. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7169-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 25Bell E. Ehrlich H.P. Buttle D.J. Nakatsuji T. Science. 1981; 211: 1052-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). Stable RNA interference technology, in combination with organotypic culture, was used to study AKT loss-of-function in a more physiological differentiation system. Small hairpin RNAs targeting either AKT1 or AKT2 were designed and cloned into the pSUPER retroviral vector producing shAKT1 or shAKT2 constructs, respectively. Following infection of primary keratinocytes with virus containing either shAKT1 or shAKT2 alone, or in combination, cells were assessed for AKT1 and AKT2 expression. Densitometric analysis of immunoblots indicated that infection with the shAKT1 construct resulted in an 80-90% reduction in AKT1 expression levels, while 50-75% reduction was achieved with the shAKT2 molecule. Expression of a nonspecific small-hairpin RNA, shSCRAM, was used as a control (Fig. 3A). Equivalent reduction in expression for each was observed with the combination (Fig. 3A) and could be maintained for at least six passages after selection. To show dysfunction of AKT pathway signaling in knockdown cells, phosphorylation of endogenous GSK3 after stimulation with EGF and IGF-1 was assessed. While levels of phospho-GSK3 in proliferating keratinocytes were comparable in shSCRAM and shAKT1/2 cells, the latter failed to respond to growth factor treatment (Fig. 3B), demonstrating impaired AKT signaling in the knockdown cells.FIGURE 3AKT isoform specific RNA interference. A, first passage primary keratinocytes were infected with pSUPER retroviruses expressing short-hairpin RNAs targeting AKT1 (shAKT1), AKT2 (shAKT2), or a combination of these two (shAKT1/2). Virus containing a scrambled nonspecific target sequence (shSCRAM) was used as a control. Knockdown of AKT1 and AKT2 in stable cell lines was assessed by isoform specific immunoblots. B, to show impaired AKT signaling in knockdown cells, proliferating (cyc), growth factor-deprived (0′), or IGF-1/EGF-stimulated (15′) cells were lysed, and the presence of endogenous phospho-GSK3 was assessed by immunoblot. The membrane was stripped and reprobed with a total GSK3 antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These cells were subjected to organotypic culture, where each cell type was seeded onto a collagen I matrix embedded with fibroblasts and allowed to grow to confluence. Subsequently, the monolayer was raised to the air:medium interface, which stimulates the stratification process. Targeted disruption of AKT1 (shAKT1) resulted in a severe defect in stratification with a thin parabasal region but a thickened stratum corneum, or hyperkeratosis, when compared with control (shSCRAM; Fig. 4A), while knockdown of AKT2 (shAKT2) resulted in a normal appearing epithelium. The effect of combined AKT1 and AKT2 knockdown (shAKT1/2) appeared no different from that of targeting AKT1 alone. Lamination of the upper squamous layer as observed in control cultures was absent in shAKT1 cultures, suggesting disruption of aspects of late differentiation. This is consistent with previous studies showing that AKT/PI3K is required for late differentiation (18Janes S.M. Ofstad T.A. Campbell D.H. Watt F.M. Prowse D.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4157-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Calautti E. Li J. Saoncella S. Brissette J.L. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 32856-32865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the presence of a granular layer was not apparent in the shAKT1 cultures and together these data demonstrate that reduced AKT1 expression disrupts homeostatic stratification.FIGURE 4AKT deficiency results in abnormal epidermal stratification.

Indicated are: basal layer (b), spinous layer (s); granular layer (g), and cornified layer (c).

C, a higher power magnification of the suprbasal layers in shSCRAM and shAKT1 cultures are shown to demostrate the presence of condensed (pyknotic) nuclei in shAKT1 cultures.

Mutations in ML1 result in mucolipidosis type IV, a lysosomal storage disease characterized by the intracellular accumulation of enlarged vacuolar structures containing phospholipids, sphingolipids, and mucopolysaccharides. Little is known about how ML1 trafficking or activity is regulated. Here we have examined the processing and trafficking of ML1 in a variety of cell types. We find that a significant fraction of ML1 undergoes cell type-independent cleavage within the first extracellular loop of the protein during a late step in its biosynthetic delivery. To determine the trafficking route of ML1, we systematically examined the effect of ablating adaptor protein complexes on the localization of this protein. Whereas ML1 trafficking was not apparently affected in fibroblasts from mocha mice that lack functional adaptor protein complex (AP)-3, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown revealed a requirement for AP-1 in Golgi export of ML1. Knockdown of functional AP-2 had no effect on ML1 localization. Interestingly, cleavage of ML1 was not compromised in AP-1-deficient cells, suggesting that proteolysis occurs in a prelysosomal compartment, possibly the trans-Golgi network. Our results suggest that posttranslational processing of ML1 is more complex than previously described and that this protein is delivered to lysosomes primarily via an AP-1-dependent route that does not involve passage via the cell surface.

Pflugers Arch. 2004; 451: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, lysosomal storage bodies appearing as enlarged vacuolar structures are found in every cell type of affected individuals, with the accumulated products including a broad range of phospholipids, sphingolipids, and mucopolysaccharides (1Bach G. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 451: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 2Bargal R. Goebel H.H. Latta E. Bach G. Neuropediatrics. 2002; 33: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other classes of mucolipidoses include sialidosis (type I), I-cell disease (type II), and pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (type III), where accumulation is a result of impaired targeting of the lysosomal hydrolases involved in the catabolism of the stored lipids. However, lysosomal hydrolase activity is not impaired in MLIV, since the accumulated lipid products have been previously shown to be catabolized normally (3Bargal R. Bach G. J. Inherit. Metab. Dis. 1997; 20: 625-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rather, MLIV pathophysiology has been linked to mutations in the transient receptor potential (TRP) channel family member mucolipin-1 (TRPML subfamily; herein referred to as ML1), where mutations result in a defect in membrane sorting along the late endocytic pathway (4Bassi M.T.

Mammalian TRP channels are a large class of proteins that are characterized by a common structure and permeability to both monovalent cations and Ca2+ ions (7Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C.

TRPs have wide-spread tissue distributions and have been implicated in diverse cellular functions, including roles in mechanosensation, osmosensation, sensation of fluid flow in vascular endothelia, sensation of temperature, pain, and touch, and transepithelial transport of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (7Clapham D.E.

Specifically, mucolipin-1 (ML1) is a 580-amino acid protein that has a molecular mass of 65 kDa and has been localized to late endosomes/lysosomes in several cell types (10Manzoni M. Monti E.

Two other mammalian mucolipin family members have also been identified, ML2 and ML3. Whereas little is known regarding ML2 function, mutations in the mouse Mcoln3 gene are associated with deafness and pigmentation defects in varitint-waddler (Va) mice (11Di Palma F. Belyantseva I.A.

ML1 has six predicted transmembrane-spanning segments and is oriented with both the amino and carboxyl termini in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4A), a characteristic trait of all TRP channel family members. The TRP domain of ML1 spans transmembrane segments 3-6 with the pore region occurring between the fifth and sixth segments. Additionally, ML1 has a large extracellular loop, located between the first and second transmembrane segments that has four consensus N-linked glycosylation sites. Among other TRP family members, only polycystin-2 (TRPP subfamily) shares this feature of having a large extracellular loop. It is thought that this large extracellular loop may be involved in channel activation, since both ML1 and polycystin-2 have relatively short amino- and carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tails that often serve as activation regions for other cation channels. ML1 also has a carboxyl-terminal dileucine targeting motif that has been postulated to serve as the lysosomal targeting signal for ML1 (4Bassi M.T. Manzoni M. Monti E. Pizzo M.T. Ballabio A.

Much of what is presently known regarding ML1 has come from studies in Caenorhabditis elegans where the ML1 functional orthologue, CUP-5, has been identified. Mutations in the cup-5 gene have been described to cause a defect in lysosome biogenesis, since CUP-5 is localized to both late endosome-lysosome fusion sites as well as to mature lysosomes. The observed endocytic abnormalities observed in cup-5 mutants were rescued upon the addition of either human ML1 or ML3 (16Treusch S. Knuth S. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Goldin E. Grant B.D. Fares H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4483-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is hypothesized that ML1 may be responsible for regulating fusion events during the biogenesis of lysosomes (16Treusch S. Knuth S. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Goldin E. Grant B.D. Fares H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4483-4488Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Fares H. Greenwald I. Nat. Genet. 2001; 28: 64-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Piper R.C. Luzio J.P.

However, little is known about how ML1 is targeted to late endosomes/lysosomes or how this ion channel may function to regulate membrane trafficking events along this pathway. Here, we have investigated the posttranslational processing and trafficking of ML1. We find that ML1 is cleaved at a site between the second and third N-glycans of the first extracellular loop. Delivery of ML1 to lysosomes occurs via a direct pathway dependent on adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) and does not involve passage via the cell surface. ML1 cleavage occurs late in the biosynthetic pathway, after the glycans have been sialylated, but prior to lysosomal delivery, since inhibition of lysosomal delivery does not prevent cleavage. The apparently exclusive requirement for AP-1 in ML1 delivery suggests that surface delivery of this channel may have physiologically detrimental effects on cells. DNA Constructs—Constructs encoding human ML1 (corresponding to accession number BC005149) double-tagged with HA at the amino terminus and with Myc upstream of the carboxyl-terminal dileucine motif, or tagged individually with HA or Myc epitopes were provided by Kirill Kiselyov (28Kiselyov K.

A double-tagged ML1 construct in which a premature stop codon was inserted into the ML1 open reading frame prior to the lysine residue at amino acid position 577 (ML1 ΔLLVN) was also a gift of Dr. Kiselyov. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The mutations N179A, N220A, N230A, R200A, and K219A were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations and overall plasmid integrity were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The following forward (F) and reverse (R) primer pairs were used to introduce the desired mutations: N179A (F), 5′-CGTGGACCCGGCCGCCGACACATTTGAC-3′; N179A (R), 5′-GTCAAATGTGTCGCGGGCCGGGTCCACG-3′; N220A (F), 5′-GGAAAGCAGCTCCAGTTACAAGGCCCTCACGCTC-3′; N220A (R), 5′-GAGCGTGAGGGCCTTGTAACTGGAGCTGCTTTCC-3′; N230A (F), 5′-CCACAAGCTGGTCGCTGTCACCATCCACTTCC-3′; N230A (R), 5′-GGAAGTGGATGGTGACAGCGACCAGCTTGTGG-3′; R200A (F), 5′-GATCCCCCCGAGGCGCCCCCTCCGCC-3′; R200A (R), 5′-GGCGGAGGGGGCGCCTCGGGGGGATC-3′; K219A (F), 5′-GGAAAGCAGCTCCAGTTACGCGAACCTCACGCTCAAATT-3′; K219A (R), 5′-GAATTTGAGCGTGAGGTTCGCGTAACTGGAGCTGCTTTCC-3′. Insertion of an External HA Epitope Tag—We used a modified version of the QuikChange (Stratagene) site-directed mutagenesis protocol (19Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) to incorporate an HA epitope tag into the first extracellular loop between amino acids 249 (Glu) and 250 (Ile) of Myc-tagged ML1 (referred to as ML1-HA(ext)). The following primers were used (underlined and boldface text indicate nucleotides corresponding to the HA epitope sequence): forward, 5′-CAGAGCCTCATCAATAATGAGATGTACCCATACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCTATCCCGGACTGCTATACCTTC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAGGTATAGCAGTCCGGGATAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTACATCTCATTATTGATGAGGCTCTG-3′. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—HEK293 and HeLa SS6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Primary cultures of rabbit cornea epithelial cells were provided by Emily Guerriero and Nirmala SundarRaj and were maintained in DMEM-F-12 supplemented with 40 μg/ml gentamicin, 0.5% Me2SO, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, 10 ng/ml human epidermal growth factor, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 8% FBS. NIH 3T3 and mocha fibroblasts were provided by Gudrun Ihrke and were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. For transient transfections, cells were plated in either 6- or 24-well plates at 30% confluence and incubated until cells reached ∼75-80% confluence. Transient transfections using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. For HEK293 cells or fibroblasts cultured in 6-well plates, the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 ratio used was 2 μg of DNA to 5 μl of Lipofectamine. For HeLa SS6 cells or fibroblasts grown in 24-well plates, the ratio used was 0.8 μg of DNA to 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Immunoblotting of ML1—Transiently transfected cells were solubilized in 1.5% (v/v) C12E9 (Calbiochem) in buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. This detergent solution was additionally supplemented with 1 μg/ml aprotinin and complete mini-EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Applied Science). Samples were immunoprecipitated using monoclonal anti-HA (HA.11; Covance) or monoclonal anti-c-Myc (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) antibodies. Antibody-antigen complexes were recovered using Pansorbin cells (Calbiochem). Samples were then washed one time each in HBS (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing either 1% Triton X-100 or 0.01% SDS and then washed one final time in HBS alone. Samples were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and heated to 60 °C for 30 min and loaded onto 4-15% Tris-HCl precast gels (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis and transfer to Highbond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) was performed using the Criterion Western blotting system (Bio-Rad). Membranes were then incubated for 2 h with anti-HA-HRP or anti-c-Myc-HRP (Roche Applied Science). HRP-reactive bands were detected using Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and membranes were exposed to Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat Blue film. The relative molecular mass of immunoreactive bands was assessed using Precision Plus Protein Standards (Bio-Rad). Samples treated with N-glycanase (New England Biolabs) were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA antibody, and immunocomplexes were recovered as described above. Samples were washed and eluted for 30 min at 60 °C with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 0.2% SDS, and 7.5% glycerol. Following elution, samples were subjected to brief centrifugation, the supernatants were recovered, and 0.5 μl of N-glycanase (New England Biolabs; 1.5 units of active enzyme) was added to each sample. Control samples were treated identically except that N-glycanase was omitted from the incubation. Samples were incubated overnight at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. The following day, 2-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer was added to each sample (to a final volume of 30 μl) and incubated at 60 °C for 30 min. Samples were electrophoresed on 4-15% Tris-HCl gels and immunoblotted as described above. Metabolic Labeling of ML1—Transiently transfected HEK293 cells on 6-well plates were starved in cysteine- and methionine-free medium for 30 min and then radiolabeled with 1 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (MP Biomedicals) for 2 h. Cells were chased in serum-free DMEM for 0 or 2 h and then solubilized, and ML1 was immunoprecipitated as described above. Samples were then either treated with N-glycanase as described above or directly solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer and incubated for 30 min at 60 °C prior to electrophoresis on 4-15% Tris-HCl gels. Dried gels were analyzed using a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad), and the relative molecular mass of visualized bands was compared with Rainbow [14C]methylated protein molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). Where indicated, the following drugs were added during both the radiolabeling and chase periods: leupeptin (Sigma; 20 μm), CA-074-Me (Calbiochem; 2 μm), and brefeldin A (Calbiochem; 10 μg/ml). Indirect Immunofluorescence—Transiently transfected cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and incubated in blocking solution (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min. Samples were incubated for 60 min in primary antibody at the following dilutions: mouse monoclonal anti-HA (1:500); rat monoclonal anti-HA (clone 3F10; Roche Applied Science) (1:250); polyclonal anti-cathepsin D generated against the human peptide (20Faust P.L. Wall D.A. Perara E. Lingappa V.R. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1937-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (1:250); monoclonal AP.6 directed against AP-2 α subunit (American Type Culture Collection) (1:10); monoclonal anti-γ-adaptin (BD Biosciences) (1:250); monoclonal anti-giantin (1:400) (gift from Dr. Adam Linstedt, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA), and monoclonal anti-lamp-2 directed against either the human epitope (H4B4) or mouse epitope (ABL-93) (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA) (developed by J. Thomas August) (1:10). After washing, samples were incubated for 60 min with species-appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated to either AlexaFluor-488 or AlexaFluor-647 (Invitrogen or Molecular Probes) diluted in blocking buffer (1:500). Confocal imaging was performed on an Olympus IX-81 (Melville, NY) equipped with an UltraView spinning disc confocal head (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and an argon-ion, argon-krypton, and helium-cadmium laser combiner. Images were acquired with a ×60 or ×100 plan-apochromat objective (numerical aperture 1.4) and the appropriate filter combination. The TIFF images were imported into Adobe Photoshop (Adobe, Mountain View, CA) to adjust contrast and image size. Antibody Uptake Assay—NIH 3T3 or mocha fibroblasts grown on coverslips were transfected where indicated to express ML1-HA(ext). Cells were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of appropriate antibodies (monoclonal HA for ML1-HA(ext)-transfected cells or antimurine lamp-2 (ABL-93; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) for untransfected cells) diluted to 50 μg/ml in DMEM containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Leupeptin (20 μm) was included during the incubation to minimize degradation of any lysosomally delivered antibody. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, quenched with PBS-glycine, permeabilized for 3 min with 0.5% Triton X-100, and blocked for 15 min in blocking solution. Following block, cells were incubated with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody and processed for immunofluorescence as described above. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of AP-1 γ and AP-2 α Subunits—Doublestranded siRNAs targeting human forms of either the AP-1 γ or AP-2 α subunit were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). For the AP-1 γ subunit, the target sequence used was 5′-AAGTTCCTGAACTTATGGAGA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 528-548 of the human AP-1 complex γ1 subunit mRNA (accession number Y12226). For the AP-2 α subunit, the target sequence used was 5′-GCATGTGCACGCTGGCCA-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1233-1250 of the human AP-2 α2 subunit mRNA (accession number NM_012305) Three potential target sequences were tested in each case. HeLa SS6 cells were plated in 24-well dishes and allowed to grow to ∼50% confluence. Cells were transfected with a nonsilencing negative control siRNA duplex (Qiagen) or siRNA oligonucleotides targeted against the γ-subunit of AP-1 and/or the α-subunit of AP-2 using the TransIT-TKO oligonucleotide transfection reagent (Mirus). For single knockdowns, 3 μl of siRNA oligonucleotide (20 μm) and 4.5 μl of transfection reagent were added per well; for samples transfected with both α- and γ-siRNAs, 3 μl of each oligonucleotide and 4.5 μl of transfection reagent were added. After 24 h, cells were transfected with cDNA encoding double-tagged ML1 (0.8 μg) and Lipofectamine 2000 (2 μl) and allowed to grow for an additional 18-24 h. Cells were either processed for immunofluorescence as described above or for immunoblotting. For Western blotting, cells were trypsinized and quenched with an equal volume of DMEM, 10% FBS. After centrifugation, cell pellets were washed once with PBS and then solubilized in 95 °C 2-fold concentrated Laemmli sample buffer. After determination of relative protein concentrations by Coomassie stain, equal amounts of protein were loaded on a second 4-15% Tris-HCl gel and processed for Western blot using monoclonal anti-AP-2 α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:5000), polyclonal anti-AP-1 γ (AE/1; 1:2000) (21Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Ungewickell E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4933-4942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and E7 anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:5000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA; developed by M. Klymkosky). ML1 was detected in siRNA-treated samples after solubilization, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting as described above. ML1 Is Cleaved Late in the Biosynthetic Pathway—Western blot analysis of transiently expressed ML1 demonstrated multiple immunoreactive species that could represent proteolytic processing. To examine this further, we expressed a construct encoding ML1 containing an amino-terminal HA and an internal carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope tag in HEK293 cells. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, immunoblotted using HRP-conjugated anti-HA, and then stripped and reprobed using HRP-conjugated anti-Myc antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A, full-length ML1 was detected using either antibody as a doublet at ∼60-70 kDa that probably represents the immature and mature glycosylated forms of the protein. In addition, a ladder of more slowly migrating bands was also observed (see also Fig. 1C), consistent with multimerization of this highly hydrophobic protein. Numerous approaches to dissociate these multimers were unsuccessful. In the anti-HA blot, an additional band at ∼37 kDa was detected, whereas when the same blot was reprobed with anti-Myc, a distinct band at ∼40 kDa was seen. These data suggest that ML1 is cleaved into two roughly equally sized fragments that can be co-isolated upon immunoprecipitation with an antibody against the N-terminal tag. The same results were obtained when ML1 was immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1C). Consistent with its hydrophobic character, the carboxyl-terminal Myc-reactive product also appeared to be sensitive to aggregation, since bands corresponding to dimers and higher order multimers of this cleavage product were routinely visualized by antibodies against the Myc epitope. To determine whether the proteolytic cleavage event occurs early or late in the biosynthetic processing of ML1, we radiolabeled HEK293 cells transiently expressing ML1 for 2 h and solubilized the cells after a 0- or 2-h chase period. Lysates were immunoprecipitated using either anti-HA or anti-Myc antibody and examined by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1B (top), ML1 was initially precipitated as a ∼65-75-kDa doublet representing immature and fully glycosylated (sialylated) full-length protein. After the 2-h chase period, the immature glycosylated form of ML1 was no longer detected, consistent with N-glycan processing. At this time point, a broad band migrating at ∼40 kDa was also detected, presumably representing the amino- and carboxyl-terminal ML1 cleavage fragments, which migrate with similar mobility on SDS-PAGE. The appearance of these cleavage products concomitant with maturation of the glycans on ML1 strongly suggests that proteolysis occurs after sialylation rather than early in the biosynthetic pathway. To further examine ML1 processing, HEK293 cells were treated with brefeldin A to prevent transit of newly synthesized ML1 along the biosynthetic pathway. In cells treated with brefeldin A, both cleavage and N-glycan processing are abolished, as is indicated by the absence of the ∼40-kDa cleavage product and the loss of the ∼65-75-kDa doublet after the 2-h chase period (Fig. 1B, bottom panel). These results strongly suggest that cleavage of ML1 occurs at a post-ER site. Importantly, the cleavage site within ML1 appears to be cell type-independent, since similar products were observed when ML1 was expressed in several other cell types, including HeLa, Madin-Darby canine kidney, and rabbit cornea epithelial cells (Fig. 2). Based on the sizes of the cleavage product, we hypothesized that cleavage occurs within the first, relatively large extracellular loop of ML1. This loop contains the only four potential N-glycosylation sites on ML1. Both cleavage products (HAML1 and ML1Myc) were sensitive to N-glycanase treatment, confirming that cleavage occurs within this loop (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we reproducibly found that N-glycanase treatment of the carboxyl-terminal half of the protein produced two distinct bands roughly 3 and 6 kDa smaller than the original fragment (indicated by arrows). These bands probably represent cleavage of either one or two N-glycans from this fragment, respectively. Longer treatments with N-glycanase demonstrated a precursor product relationship between the two, suggesting that cleavage of one of the N-glycans in this fragment is considerably more efficient than the other (Fig. 1D). We never observed complete conversion to the more rapidly migrating form, even when the N-glycanase treatment was carried out overnight and spiked with fresh enzyme. Cleavage of ML1 Occurs between the Second and Third N-Glycans of the First Extracellular Loop—Our initial N-glycanase experiments suggest that the carboxyl-terminal fragment of ML1 contains at least two N-glycans. To test this more directly, we used site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt the N-glycosylation consensus sequences of the second, third, or fourth N-glycan and examined the effect of these mutations on the electrophoretic mobility of the HA- and Myc-tagged fragments immunoprecipitated from transiently transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 3, abolishment of the second N-glycosylation consensus sequence affected the mobility of the N-terminal fragment (HA fragment) without disrupting the carboxyl-terminal half (Myc fragment) of the protein. In contrast, removal of the third or fourth N-glycan had no effect on amino-terminal mobility but resulted in a shift in MW of the carboxylterminal half of the protein. Interestingly, the resulting mobilities of the N220A and N230A carboxyl-terminal fragments were different, suggesting that the third and fourth glycans are normally processed some-what differently. Such differential processing of N-glycans at distinct positions has previously been observed (22Machamer C.E. Florkiewicz R.Z. Rose J.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3074"

The ring cleavage reaction is reversible and is achieved by hydrolysis of the amide bond between nitrogen 3 and carbon 4 of the dihydropyrimidine ring (Scheme 1). As an integral part of the pyrimidine catabolic pathway, DHPase activity is required for the regulation of the pyrimidine pool size available for nucleic acid synthesis and for supplying the cell with β-alanine.

More than 80% of the administered dose of 5-fluorouracil is rapidly catabolized by the pyrimidine-degrading enzymes (8Heggie G.D. Sommadossi J.P. Cross D.S. Huster W.J. Diasio R.B. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2203-2206PubMed Google Scholar), which thus represent major determinants of drug efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity. DHPase has also been implicated in the metabolism of dexrazoxane, an antioxidant agent used to reduce the cardiotoxic side effects of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (9Hasinoff B.B. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1993; 21: 883-888PubMed Google Scholar). DHPases from a range of eukaryotic species (10Traut T.W. Loechel S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have been purified from natural sources or as recombinant proteins. All are homotetrameric Zn2+-metalloenzymes, with subunit molecular masses ranging from 56 kDa for DHPase from slime mold to 65 kDa for the fruit fly enzyme (16Gojkovic Z. Rislund L. Andersen B. Sandrini M.P.B. Cook P.F. Schnackerz K.D. Piškur J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Besides the reversible ring opening of its physiological substrates dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine, DHPase also catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of 5-monosubstituted hydantoins and succinimides (17Dudley K.H. Butler T.C. Bius D.L. Drug Metab. Dispos. 1974; 2: 103-112PubMed Google Scholar), which led to the hypothesis that DHPase is identical to the enzyme hydantoinase (Hyd) and hence to the synonymous use of both names in the EC nomenclature. However, the DHPases from Saccharomyces kluyveri and Dictyostelium discoideum do not hydrolyze hydantoins (16Gojkovic Z. Rislund L. Andersen B. Sandrini M.P.B. Cook P.F. Schnackerz K.D. Piškur J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and not all Hyds, i.e. the bacterial counterparts of DHPase, hydrolyze dihydropyrimidines and are therefore not likely to be involved in the reductive pyrimidine catabolism (18Kim G.-J. Kim H.-S. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 295-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Syldatk C. May O. Altenbuchner J. Mattes R. Siemann M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Hyds are utilized for the biotechnological production of optically pure d-amino acids (20Altenbuchner J. Siemann-Herzberg M. Syldatk C. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 559-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), but their natural substrates are often unknown. It has been suggested to classify the enzymes involved in the reductive pathway of pyrimidine degradation as DHPases, whereas the name hydantoinase should be reserved for all enzymes that hydrolyze (5-monosubstituted) hydantoin and have other physiological roles (19Syldatk C. May O. Altenbuchner J. Mattes R. Siemann M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 51: 293-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). DHPases exhibit 24-43% amino acid sequence identity to Hyds, whereas pairwise sequence identities between DHPases range from 27% for evolutionary distant species (human/yeast) to 94% for close relatives (rat/mouse). Significant homology to other amidohydrolases such as dihydroorotase (DHOase), which catalyzes the mirror reaction of DHPase in the pyrimidine biosynthesis, urease, and allantoinase suggests evolutionary relationship between these enzymes (15Gojkovic Z. Jahnke K. Schnackerz K.D. Piškur J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1073-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Holm L. Sander C.

In addition, similarity has been detected within genes/proteins involved in the development of the nervous system, such as collapsin response-mediator protein (CRMP) (23Goshima Y. Nakamura F. Strittmatter P. Strittmatter S.M. Nature. 1995; 376: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 24Hamajima N. Matsuda K. Sakata S. Tamaki N. Sasaki M. Nonaka M. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 180: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In recent years structural information has been obtained for most of these DHPase-homologous amidohydrolases, e.g. for Hyd (25Radha Kishan K.V. Vohra R.M. Ganesan K. Agrawal V. Sharma V.M. Sharma R.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6989-6997Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), and urease (31Jabri E. Carr M.B. Hausinger R.P. Karplus P.A. Science. 1995; 268: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar), as well as for the noncatalytic CRMP1 (32Deo R.C. Schmidt E.F. Elhabazi A. Togashi H. Burley S.K. Strittmatter S.M. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). They share a common subunit structure with a (β/α)8-barrel core. Often it is accompanied by a β-sandwich domain, which can significantly vary in size and is missing completely, for example, in phosphotriesterase (33Benning M.M. Kuo J.M. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15001-15007Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). With the exception of CRMP1, all these proteins contain two metal ions and a post-translationally modified lysine residue for their coordination in the active site. In this study, we report the first crystal structures of eukaryotic DHPases, from the yeast S. kluyveri (SkDHPase) and the slime mold D. discoideum (DdDHPase). Although their overall fold is closely related, the assembly of the physiologically relevant tetramer differs with regard to the formation of the dimer-dimer interface. The SkDHPase sequence contains several short insertions that are not found in other DHPases or Hyds. Complexes of this enzyme with the substrate 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU) and the product N-carbamyl-β-alanine (NCβA) reveal amino acid residues that play a crucial role in substrate binding. Enzymatic Assay—DHPase activity was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring the change in the absorbance at 225 nm caused by the hydrolysis of the DHU ring (15Gojkovic Z. Jahnke K. Schnackerz K.D. Piškur J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1073-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A UV-3000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi) thermostated at 30 °C was used. The molar absorption coefficient for DHU at 225 nm is 1287 m-1 cm-1 (12Kautz J. Schnackerz K.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For routine enzyme assays, the reaction mixture contained 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, and 0.25 mm DHU. One unit of DHPase catalyzes the hydrolysis of 1 μmol of DHU/min at 30 °C. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Expression, Purification, and Crystallization—SkDHPase was expressed, purified, and crystallized as described (15Gojkovic Z. Jahnke K. Schnackerz K.D. Piškur J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1073-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 35Dobritzsch D. Andersen B. Piškur J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The crystals resulting in data set SkDHPase-nat were obtained by equilibration against a reservoir solution of 100 mm Bistris, pH 6.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, and 1 μm ZnCl2. The protein solution was prepared by diluting an SkDHPase stock (20 mg/ml) with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl to a final protein concentration of 3.5 mg/ml, and addition of 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and 2.5 mm DHU. Similar conditions were used to obtain crystals for SkDHPase-DHU. The only differences are the absence of DHU and the exchange of the ZnCl2 against 1 mm CaCl2 in the reservoir solution. Prior to cryoprotection, the crystals were soaked for 3 min in 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm ammonium sulfate, 22% PEG 3350, 10 mm NaHCO3, 20 μm ZnCl2, 50 mm NCβA, and 2.5 mm DHU. SkDHPase-NCβA was collected from crystals grown by equilibration against 100 mm Bistris, pH 6.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, and 100 mm trisodium citrate. The protein solution was prepared as follows: 4 ml of a 1.5 mg/ml SkDHPase solution were transferred into a dialysis cassette (Slide-A-Lyzer®; Pierce) with a 3.5-kDa molecular mass cut-off and dialyzed overnight against 1.5 liters of 17 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.4 mm ZnCl2, 8.3 mm KHCO3, and 3% (v/v) glycerol. After dialysis, the sample was concentrated to 20 mg/ml and stored at -20 °C until further use. For crystallization, the stock of dialyzed SkDHPase was diluted with 50 mm Bicine, pH 9.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm ZnCl2, and 5 mm KHCO3 to reach a final protein concentration of 3.5 mg/ml. 5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride and 50 mm NCβA were added. SkDHPase crystals belong to space group P21 and contain one homotetramer per asymmetric unit. Expression, purification, and crystallization of DdDHPase have also been described previously (36Lohkamp B. Andersen B. Piškur J. Dobritzsch D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 36-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Crystallographic data to a 2.05-Å effective resolution were collected from a single crystal, which belongs to space group I222 with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Structure Determination—Prior to data collection, SkDHPase crystals were drawn through a drop of paraffin oil for cryoprotection and flash-frozen in a nitrogen gas stream at 100 K. For cryoprotection of the DdDHPase crystals, 10% (w/v) of PEG 1000 were added to the mother liquor. Details for the data collection and processing are given in Table 1. The data sets were processed with MOSFLM and merged and scaled with SCALA; structure factors were derived with TRUNCATE (37Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab For SkDHPase, phases were obtained by molecular replacement using a d-enantiospecific hydantoinase (d-Hyd) as a search model (35Dobritzsch D. Andersen B. Piškur J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2005; 61: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Initial rigid body refinement of the polyalanine model gave a rather high free R-factor (54.1%), but the observed packing of the four protomers corresponded to the tetramer structure of Hyds and suggested that the correct solution was found. For all three SkDHPase structures, iterations of model building using the program O (39Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13009) Google Scholar) were alternated with TLS and restrained refinement in REFMAC5 (40Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13854) Google Scholar). All reflections in the given resolution range (Table 1) were used with the exception of 5% randomly selected reflections for monitoring Rfree (41Brunger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1992; 49: 24-36Crossref Google Scholar). For most residues, tight and medium NCS restraints were applied for main chain and side chain atoms, respectively. Restraints were removed for amino acids at the N and C terminus or at the borders to a flexible loop region, for the carboxylated Lys167, and for residues adopting alternate main chain conformations between the monomers (residues 104-105, 141-151, and 380-381). Waters were added using the ARP/wARP water cycling routine in REFMAC5. The final model for SkDHPase-nat contains residues 2-294 and 303-541 for chains A and B, 2-293 and 303-541 for chain C, and 2-294 and 305-541 for chain D, 8 zinc ions, and 681 water molecules. Occupancies for the zinc ions and the carboxyl group attached to Lys167 were set to the limit of appearance of negative density for these atoms, lying in the range 0.6-0.8. For SkDHPase-DHU, the |Fo| - |Fc| map after initial rigid body refinement using the refined structure of the ligand-free enzyme showed clear electron density for Zn-α and DHU and indicated low occupancies for Zn-β and the Lys167 modification. Zinc ions, substrate, and water molecules were added. The final model contains the same amino acid residues as for SkDHPase-nat, two zinc ions and one DHU molecule per subunit, as well as 1043 water molecules. Lys167 remains unmodified in chains B and C. Occupancies were set below 1.0 for all zinc ions (0.7-0.8 for Zn-α and 0.4-0.5 for Zn-β) and the carboxyl group at Lys167 in chain D. For SkDHPase-NCβA, the initial |Fo| - |Fc| map revealed additional electron density in the active sites of chains A and B, indicating partial binding of NCβA. The corresponding molecules were fitted into the density. The final model contains residues 2-294 and 303-541 for chains A and B, 2-293 and 303-541 for chain C, and 2-294 and 304-542 for chain D, 8 zinc ions, 2 NCβA, and 794 water molecules. Occupancies were set below 1.0 for the carboxyl group at Lys167 and for the side chain of Tyr172 (chains A and B). Phases for DdDHPase were obtained by molecular replacement using CRMP1 as the search model (36Lohkamp B. Andersen B. Piškur J. Dobritzsch D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F. 2006; 62: 36-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Iterations of model building using the program WinCoot (42Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23226) Google Scholar, 43Lohkamp B. Emsley P. Cowtan K. CCP4 Newsletter. 2005; 42Google Scholar) were alternated with refinement in REFMAC5. All reflections in the resolution range 45.5 to 2.05 Å were used, with the exception of 5% randomly selected reflections for monitoring Rfree. Waters were added using WinCoot. The final model contains residues 7-490, 2 zinc ions, 280 water molecules, and 1 molecule of malonate originating from the crystallization solution. The occupancies for Zn-α, Zn-β, and the carboxyl atoms attached to Lys158 were set to 0.5, 0.25, and 0.5, respectively. All models have good stereochemistry, as determined by the program PROCHECK (44Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Refinement statistics are given in Table 1. The Kabsch and Sander algorithm as implemented in DSSP was used for secondary structure assignment (45Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12270) Google Scholar). Structural alignments were carried out with the programs TOP (46Lu G. J. Appl.

https://openalex.org/W2115183604,"MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity) has been identified as a small protein secreted from malignant melanoma cells, which interacts with extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin. Here, we show that MIA negatively regulates the activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in malignant melanoma. Using far Western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation we searched for MIA-binding cell surface proteins. We found that MIA interacts with integrin α4β1 and α5β1, leading to down-regulation of integrin activity and reduction of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. These findings also suggest that MIA may play a role in tumor progression and the spread of malignant melanomas via mediating detachment of cells from extracellular matrix molecules by modulating integrin activity. Inhibiting MIA functions in vivo may therefore provide a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma disease.

We found that MIA interacts with integrin α4β1 and α5β1, leading to down-regulation of integrin activity and reduction of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling. These findings also suggest that MIA may play a role in tumor progression and the spread of malignant melanomas via mediating detachment of cells from extracellular matrix molecules by modulating integrin activity. Inhibiting MIA functions in vivo may therefore provide a novel therapeutic strategy for metastatic melanoma disease. We have previously identified MIA (melanoma inhibitory activity), an 11-kDa protein secreted into the tissue culture supernatant from malignant melanoma cells (1Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.-K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar). MIA expression in vivo correlates with progressive malignancy of melanocytic tumors (2Bosserhoff A.-K. Hein R. Bogdahn U. Buettner R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 490-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Additionally, in recent studies we detected enhanced MIA protein levels specifically in the serum of patients with metastatic melanomas (3Bosserhoff A.-K. Kaufmann M. Kaluza B. Bartke I. Zirngibl H. Hein R. Stolz W. Buettner R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3149-3153PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro studies revealed a role for MIA in supporting the invasive and migratory potential of melanoma cells. In vivo studies in two animal model systems confirmed the importance of MIA in melanoma metastasis. MIA expression levels parallel closely the capability of melanoma cells to form metastases in syngeneic animals (4Guba M. Bosserhoff A.-K. Steinbauer M. Abels C. Anthuber M. Buettner R. Jauch K.W.

Furthermore, NMR spectra revealed that MIA interacts with peptides matching to type III human fibronectin repeats that are closely related to α4β1 integrin-binding sites (6Stoll R. Renner C. Zweckstetter M. Bruggert M. Ambrosius D. Palme S. Engh R.A. Golob M. Breibach I. Buettner R. Voelter W. Holak T.A. Bosserhoff A.-K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 340-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These data support a model in which MIA regulates attachment to specific components of the extracellular matrix. Based on these results and on the observation that MIA alters melanoma cell morphology, we determined that MIA treatment results in cell detachment by decreasing interactions between melanoma cells and extracellular matrix molecules (10Bosserhoff A.-K. Stoll R. Sleeman J.P. Bataille F. Buettner R. Holak T.A. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The study presented here was performed to find additional MIA-interacting proteins and to identify signaling pathways regulated by MIA. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—The melanoma cell lines Mel Im and Mel Ei, have been described in detail previously (11Jacob K. Wach F. Holzapfel U. Hein R. Lengyel E. Buettner R. Bosserhoff A.-K. Melanoma Res. 1998; 8: 211-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cell line Mel Ei was derived from a primary cutaneous melanoma, and the cell line Mel Im was derived from a metastasis of malignant melanoma. To establish fibronectin-deficient fibroblast-like cells, primary embryonic fibroblasts were isolated from E13.5 fibronectin (flox/flox) embryos and immortalized by retroviral transduction of the SV-40 large T antigen and cloned (12Fassler R. Martin K. Forsberg E. Litzenburger T. Iglesias A. Int. Arch. Allergy Immunol. 1995; 106: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Subsequently, two clonal lines were treated with a cre-transducing adenovirus to delete the floxed fibronectin genes. The deletion of fibronectin alleles in both cre-treated clones was confirmed by PCR, and the lack of Fn protein expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using metabolically labeled conditioned media of these cells. Integrin β1-deficient cells were generated as previously published (13Fassler R. Pfaff M. Murphy J. Noegel A.A. Johansson S. Timpl R. Albrecht R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 979-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). For tissue culture the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (400 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), l-glutamine (300 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and split 1:5 every 3 days. Normal human epidermal melanocytes and keratinocytes derived from normal skin were cultivated in melanocyte medium MGM-3 or keratinocyte growth medium (Promocell, Heidelberg, Germany), respectively, under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Expression and Purification of Recombinant MIA Protein—Escherichia coli M15(pREP4) cells transfected with the expression plasmid pQE40-MIA expressing 108 residues of human MIA (Gly25–Gln131) were grown to an absorbance A600 nm = 0.6, induced by 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h and lysed by sonication. The protein was renatured from E. coli inclusion bodies as previously published (1Blesch A. Bosserhoff A.-K. Apfel R. Behl C. Hessdoerfer B. Schmitt A. Jachimczak P. Lottspeich F. Buettner R. Bogdahn U. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5695-5701PubMed Google Scholar). Refolded human MIA was applied to hydrophobic interaction chromatography and further purified on a S-Sepharose Fast Flow (Sigma). Finally, gel filtration was performed on a Superdex 200 Prep Grade (Sigma). Fractions containing human MIA were pooled and concentrated. Purified protein was checked by SDS-PAGE and high pressure liquid chromatography and was shown to be 95% pure (data not shown). Expression of Recombinant Biotinylated MIA Protein—A MIA prokaryotic expression vector with a 15-amino acid Avi tag peptide sequence including a FXa cleavage site was constructed by overlap extension PCR. The MIA cDNA construct was cloned into the vector pIVEX2.3-MCS (Roche Applied Science). The expression vector was used in the rapid translation system, a cell-free E. coli-based protein transcription/translation system (Roche Applied Science). By adding biotin, ATP, and the E. coli biotin protein ligase BirA during the procedure, the protein was biotinylated at the introduced Avi tag at the N terminus and called biotinylated MIA. The correct function and folding of the protein was tested by performing a well established MIA-ELISA 2The abbreviations used are: ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MAP, mitogenactivated protein; MAPK, MAP kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. and functional assays. Assays for Protein-Protein Interaction—Purified integrins (α4β1 (1:100 in PBS), α5β1 (1:500 in PBS) (14Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J.A. Parkinson S.J. Parker P.J. Ng T.T. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar)), 5% BSA in PBS, as control, or biotinylated MIA (1 μg/ml in PBS), respectively, were coated each in a volume of 100 μl onto 96-well high binding protein plates (Costar) overnight at 4 °C. After 17 h the coated wells were blocked with 200 μl of blocking buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5% BSA) for 2 h, washed three times with 200 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and 0.1% BSA), and exposed to 100 μl of 1 μg/ml purified biotinylated MIA in binding buffer for 2 h at room temperature. The controls were exposed to 1 μg/ml BSA. After three washing steps with binding buffer, MIA binding was quantified using a peroxidasecoupled monoclonal anti-MIA antibody and the substrate 2,2′-azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] (ABTS) (Roche Applied Science). The reactions were measured at A405 nm. The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. For co-immunoprecipitation 100 μg of cell lysates dissolved in binding buffer (20 mm NaPO4, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7,5) were precleared with 25 μl of protein streptavidin-coupled G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. After centrifugation the supernatant was transferred into a fresh vial and incubated with biotinylated MIA with shaking at 4 °C overnight. Then 50 μl of protein streptavidin-coupled G-Sepharose was added for 1 h, pelleted, washed three times with binding buffer, resuspended in 20 μl of Laemmli's buffer, heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. All of the proteins binding to MIA were stained by silver staining (Silver Express Staining; Invitrogen). The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Additionally, specific proteins were identified by Western blot. Protein Analysis in Vitro (Western Blotting)—For protein isolation 2 × 106 cells were washed with 1× PBS and lysed in 200 μl of RIPA buffer (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Balanced amounts of cell proteins (50 μg) were denatured at 70 °C for 10min after addition of Roti-load-buffer (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and subsequently separated on NuPAGE-SDS gels (Invitrogen). After transferring the proteins onto PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad), the membranes were blocked in 3% BSA/PBS for 1 h and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of primary polyclonal rabbit anti integrin α2, 3, 4, or 5 antibody or anti-ERK1/2, anti P-ERK1/2 (R & D, Richmond, VA; Chemicon, Hampshire, UK) overnight at 4 °C. A 1:2000 dilution of anti-rabbit-AP (Chemicon) was used as a secondary antibody. Staining was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Zytomed, Heidelberg, Germany). All of the experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. The peptide spot analysis (Jerini, Berlin, Germany) was performed to assay kinase activity following the manufacturer's instructions. MIA Far Western—SDS-PAGE was performed with 40 μg of RIPA lysates from melanoma cell lines and controls, respectively. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane by electroblotting. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min and incubated with biotinylated MIA (1 μg/ml) for 3 h at 4 °C. After three washing steps with PBS, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatasecoupled streptavidin for 30 min. Staining was performed using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate solution (Zytomed). The experiments were repeated three times with similar results. MIA-ELISA—MIA produced recombinantly was measured using an ELISA system (Roche Applied Science). 1 × 106 cells were cultured in 5 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the amount of MIA secreted into the supernatant was quantified by ELISA. Monoclonal antibodies coupled with biotin or peroxidase, respectively, were used to quantify MIA in a 96-well plate coated with streptavidin. 2,2′-Azino-di[3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate] (ABTS) was used as substrate and quantified at A405 nm. FACS Analysis—To analyze binding of MIA to the cell surface, the cells were detached from flasks using 5 mm EDTA and resuspended in PBS. 106 cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml biotinylated MIA for 1 h at 4 °C. For specific competition probes were incubated with 400 and 800 ng/ml recombinant MIA, respectively. After three washing steps with PBS, the secondary antibody (neutravidin/fluorescein isothiocyanate) was added for 1 h at 4°C. After additional washing with PBS, FACS analysis was performed. To analyze whether MIA regulates integrin activity, the cells were detached from flasks using 5 mm EDTA in PBS. The cells were resuspended in PBS (107 cells/ml) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose and treated with biotinylated MIA (1 μg/ml), with MnCl2 or with EDTA. One mm MnCl2 was used to activate all integrins, and 1 mm EDTA was used to inactivate integrin activity (15Humphries J.D. Schofield N.R. Mostafavi-Pour Z. Green L.J. Garratt A.N. Mould A.P. Humphries M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10234-10243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 50 μl of the treated cells were mixed with 50 μl of the primary antibody 12G10 (20 μg/ml) (specific for activated integrins) and incubated for 60 min on ice. Additionally, an antibody was used staining β1 independent on the activation status (Chemicon). After three washing steps with PBS with 1% fetal calf serum, the cells were stained with the secondary antibody streptavidin/cy5 in PBS with 10% serum for 30 min. After three washing steps the probes were fixed (100 μl of PBS, 100 μl of 2% formaldehyde), washed, and resuspended in a volume of 300 μl of PBS. FACS data were analyzed using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson). Statistical significance was determined by Kolmogorow-Smirnov analysis. All of the experiments were repeated three times. Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. (range) or percentages. Comparison between groups was made using the Student's paired t test. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All of the calculations were performed using the GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego, CA). MIA Reduces MAP Kinase Activity in Malignant Melanoma—One aim of this study was to identify signaling pathways regulated by MIA. To analyze the influence of MIA treatment on MAP kinase (MAPK) activity, we used an assay measuring phosphorylation of myosin-binding protein by MAPK. This activity assay revealed a strong reduction of MAPK activity with a maximum 1 h after the beginning of MIA treatment (Fig. 1A). After excluding the MAPKs p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase to be regulated via MIA (data not shown), we used antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 to specifically analyze ERK activity after MIA treatment. MIA treatment induced a strong reduction of ERK1/2 activity in melanoma cell lines; maximum of inhibition was detected 45 min to 2 h after beginning of MIA treatment (Fig. 1B). Regulation of ERK activity by MIA was confirmed by peptide spot analysis (data not shown). MIA is known to bind to several matrix proteins including fibronectin and to promote detachment of melanoma cells (10Bosserhoff A.-K. Stoll R. Sleeman J.P. Bataille F. Buettner R. Holak T.A. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation depends on MIA binding to fibronectin and consecutive detachment of the cells, we treated melanoma cells with RGD peptides. The RGD sequence in protein domains is known to be a binding site for integrins in extracellular matrix proteins like fibronectin and to be crucial for cells to perceive and attach to their environment. Only a weak reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detectable after treating the cells with RGD peptides, which implies that MIA influences ERK1/2 activity at least additionally via a different cellular surface motif than the RGD sequence (Fig. 1C). MIA Binds to Cell Surface—To identify potential cell surface receptors and modulators of cell signaling, we used biotinylated MIA to analyze binding of MIA to the cell surface. FACS analysis revealed specific binding of MIA to the cell surface of melanoma cells (Fig. 2). Fig. 2A presents the results of the negative control. Following incubation with MIA, a significant shift of the fluorescence signal was detectable (p < 0.001; Fig. 2B) as compared with the negative control (Fig. 2A). This shift could be competed by unlabeled MIA protein, indicating the specificity of the binding of MIA to the cell surface (400 ng/ml unlabeled MIA (Fig. 2C) and 800 ng/ml (Fig. 2D) compared with Fig. 2B). Quantitative measurements showed complete competition of the signals on the cell surface. Because MIA is known to bind to fibronectin, we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts with or without fibronectin expression in the same experiment. Here, FACS analysis revealed no differences in binding of MIA between the two cell lines (Fig. 2, F and G), indicating that binding of MIA to the cell surface was not mediated via fibronectin. Fig. 2E shows the negative control for the mouse fibroblasts. Identification of MIA Binding Partners—To identify MIA-binding proteins, co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A) and far Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) were performed. Several interacting proteins were found. Interestingly, both assays revealed bands of ∼70, 80, and 100 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3, A and B). In co-immunoprecipitation assays, binding of these proteins could be almost completely competed by an access of unlabeled MIA (Fig. 3A). Isoforms of integrins of these sizes were reported in several publications (16Chun D. Gall C.M. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Bi X.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42859-42866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Therefore, MIA co-immunoprecipitated melanoma cell lysates were analyzed in Western blots to determine whether the bands detected by far Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B) and co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3A) resemble integrins. Antibodies against α2 and α3 did not show cross-reactivity with the immunoprecipitated proteins (data not shown). However, anti-α4 and -α5 antibodies revealed specific staining (Fig. 4, A and B). Fig. 4 (A and B) shows specific immunolabeling for α4 and α5 after MIA co-immunoprecipitation of RIPA lysates of melanocytes and of the melanoma cell lines Mel Im and Mel Ei. In the control without biotinylated MIA, no staining was found. In accordance with the α4-stained immunoblot of cell lysates (Fig. 4C), a band occurred at ∼70 kDa and at 80 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4B). In immunoblots labeled with the α5 antibody, the unprocessed form of α5 appeared at ∼130 kDa in melanocytes, whereas in the melanoma cell line Mel Im smaller bands were detectable at ∼80 kDa (Fig. 4C). All of the RIPA lysates that were immunoprecipitated with biotinylated MIA clearly showed bands at ∼80 kDa.FIGURE 4Integrinsα4 andα5 immunoprecipitate with biotinylated MIA. Cell lysates of normal human epidermal melanocytes (NHEM) and melanoma cells (Mel Im and Mel Ei) were co-immunoprecipitated with biotinylated MIA (+biot. MIA). Subsequently, they were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a PVDF membrane, and immunolabeled with anti-integrin α4 and α5 antibodies. The experiment revealed binding of MIA to α5 (A) and α4(B) integrin. As control melanoma cell lysates were co-immunoprecipitated without the addition of biotinylated MIA (Mel Im). C, Western blot of cell lysates from melanocytes and Mel Im melanoma cell line with anti-integrin α4 and α5 antibodies. α4 staining revealed in all tested lysates the processed form of 80 kDa. Staining with antiintegrin α5 antibody showed the larger, 130-kDa form in melanocytes. In the melanoma cell line Mel Im, both the 130-kDa and the processed forms appeared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MIA Binds Directly to Integrin α4β1 and α5β1—To confirm direct binding of MIA to α4 and α5 integrins an ELISA with plates coated with the respective integrins was applied. MIA binding to both α4 (Fig. 5A) and α5 (Fig. 5B), integrin was demonstrated. Soluble α4 (Fig. 5A) and α5 (Fig. 5B) proteins competed MIA binding in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the specificity of the interaction between MIA and α4 and α5, respectively. Furthermore, we denatured the integrins bound to the plate by incubating them with 1 and 5 mm EDTA, respectively. EDTA complexes divalent cations and thus hinders integrins to establish their active conformation (19Juliano R.L. Reddig P. Alahari S. Edin M. Howe A. Aplin A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Under these experimental conditions, MIA binding was completely inhibited, indicating that MIA does not bind to inactivated integrins (Fig. 5). MIA Inhibits Integrin Activity—Because MIA can inhibit MAPK activity, and integrins are known to modulate MAPK signaling (19Juliano R.L. Reddig P. Alahari S. Edin M. Howe A. Aplin A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we speculated whether MIA inhibits integrin signaling by binding to integrin heterodimers. To analyze a putative effect of MIA on activated integrins, we performed FACS assays using the antibody 12G10, which is specific for activated integrins. Preparation of the cells for the FACS experiment resulted in inactive integrins (Fig. 6A, dashed line). Therefore, integrin activation was induced by pretreatment with 1 mm MnCl2 (Fig. 6A, dotted line). Subsequent MIA incubation significantly down-regulated integrin activity (p < 0.001) (Fig. 6A, bold line), almost reaching the level before MnCl2 activation. In contrast, when cells were pretreated with EDTA to inhibit integrin activity, no effect of MIA was detected (data not shown). As control the equivalent experiment was performed using an antibody detecting integrin β1 independent of the activation status (Fig. 6D). Here, no changes by incubation with MIA were seen. Analysis of MIA and Integrin Interaction—To analyze whether biotinylated MIA competes with RGD peptides for α4β1or α5β1 binding, we performed additional ELISA experiments. Consistent with our data on ERK activation, we did not find any competition of biotinylated MIA by RGD peptides for α4β1or α5β1 (Fig. 7). Both integrins α4β1 and α5β1 are known to bind to fibronectin (20Narumiya S. Abe Y. Kita Y. Miyake K. Nakajima K. Watanabe T.X. Oka Y. Sugiyama H. Yagita H. Okumura K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 139-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In Fig. 8 a diagram of the fibronectin molecule is depicted (Fig. 8A). It illustrates the fibronectin fragments 50K (Fig. 8B) and H/120 (Fig. 8C) used in the ELISA assay. The 50K fragment was shown to bind to α5β1, whereas the H/120 fragment binds to α4β1 (19Juliano R.L. Reddig P. Alahari S. Edin M. Howe A. Aplin A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We aimed to analyze the influence of each domain on the binding pattern of biotinylated MIA to α4β1 and α5β1, respectively. The fibronectin fragment 50K clearly competed MIA integrin binding for α5β1 in both low (1 μg/ml) and high (5 μg/ml) concentrations (Fig. 9A). The same finding was observed for integrin α4β1; however, competition was not as strong (Fig. 9A). In contrast, the H/120 fragment did not compete with MIA binding to α5β1 (Fig. 9B). At a concentration of 5 μg/ml H/120 even a slightly supporting effect of MIA binding to both integrins α4β1 and α5β1 was revealed (Fig. 9B).FIGURE 9Competition of MIA binding by fibronectin fragments. ELISA revealed binding of biotinylated MIA to integrins α4β1 and α5β1, respectively. Here, potential competition of this binding by fibronectin domains was analyzed. A, competition of biotinylated MIA binding to α4β1 and α5β1 by the fibronectin fragment 50K. The first through third columns depict the results for integrin α5β1, and the fourth through sixth columns show the results for α4β1. B, competition of biotinylated MIA binding to α5β1 and α4β1 by the fibronectin fragment H/120. The first through third columns show the results for α4β1, and the fourth through sixth columns show the results for α5β1. C, competition of biotinylated MIA binding to 50K fragment by the integrins α4β1 and α5β1. D, competition of biotinylated MIA binding to H/120 fragment by the integrins α4β1 and α5β1. All of the assays were repeated three times.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In the reversal of the experiment (Fig. 9C), where the fibronectin fragments were coated to the plates, α5β1 competed with MIA for binding to the 50K fragment in a dose-dependent manner, whereas α4β1 competed only weakly with MIA for binding to 50K. When the plates were coated with the H/120 fragment, α4β1 but not α5β1 competed with MIA for binding to H/120 (Fig. 9D). Next, we wanted to analyze whether the regulation of MAPK activity by MIA is modulated by direct binding of MIA to integrins. The 50K fragment was used in the experiments because of its inhibitory effect on MIA integrin interaction. Western blots with antibodies against phosphorylated ERK1/2 to specifically analyze ERK activity after MIA and MIA plus 50K treatment were performed (Fig. 10A). MIA treatment showed inhibition of ERK activity, which was reversed dose-dependently by the 50K fragment. Additionally, β1-integrin deficient cells (GD25-β1) were used in comparison with wild type cells to prove the regulation of MAPK activity by MIA via integrins. No change in ERK activity was observed after treating theβ1 integrinnegative cells with MIA, whereas the wild type cells showed clear reduction as expected (Fig. 10B). In this study we aimed to analyze signaling pathways and putative receptor molecules of MIA. Previous studies revealed direct interaction of MIA with several matrix proteins such as fibronectin or laminin (19Juliano R.L. Reddig P. Alahari S. Edin M. Howe A. Aplin A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar); however, cell surface receptors for MIA or MIA-regulated signaling pathways have not been characterized until now. Analyzing the MAP kinase pathway, we found strong reduction of ERK1/2 but not of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase activity after MIA treatment. To investigate whether this effect on ERK1/2 activity was a consequence of MIA binding to fibronectin inducing cellular detachment, we examined the effect of RGD peptides, simulating cellular detachment from fibronectin, on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Incubation of melanoma cells with RGD peptides induced only a weak reduction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation. These results implied that MIA influences ERK1/2 activity either via a different binding motive on the integrins or by as yet unknown cell surface receptors. FACS analysis revealed that MIA binds directly to the cell surface. Subsequent experiments with fibronectin positive and negative mouse embryonic fibroblasts showed no differences in MIA binding to the cell surface. Therefore, we hypothesized the existence of a cell surface molecule directly binding MIA and excluded the possibility of MIA binding to cells via matrix proteins bound to the cell surface. To characterize MIA binding partners, we performed co-immunoprecipitation analysis with consecutive SDS-PAGE and silver staining and, additionally, far Western blots. Molecules of ∼70, 80, and 100 kDa were found to bind to MIA in both experiments. Because several publications showed this pattern after staining for integrins α4 and α5 (16Chun D. Gall C.M. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 17Bi X. Lynch G. Zhou J. Gall C.M. J. Comp.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42859-42866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we analyzed whether these proteins were detectable in our co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Therefore, specific antibodies against integrin α4 and integrin α5, respectively, were used to analyze the MIA co-immunoprecipitate by Western blot. Both antibodies revealed specific staining at 70 and 80 kDa, whereas antibodies against integrins α2 and α3 did not show staining. It is known that the 150-kDa pro-protein forms of α4 and α5 are proteolytically cleaved by proprotein convertases. α4 is cleaved in the post-endoplasmatic reticulum into a C-terminal 70-kDa fragment and a N-terminal 80-kDa fragment that are noncovalently linked (21Teixido J. Parker C.M. Kassner P.D. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1786-1791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bergeron E. Basak A. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). For both α4 and α5, it has been shown that only the processed form is present on the membrane surface of cells (16Chun D. Gall C.M. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 22Bergeron E. Basak A. Decroly E. Seidah N.G. Biochem.

Chem. 2004; 279: 53442-53450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The antibodies used in our experiment were directed against the C termini of α4 and α5 integrins (16Chun D. Gall C.M. Bi X. Lynch G. Neuroscience. 2001; 105: 815-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 18Barazi H.O. Li Z. Cashel J.A. Krutzsch H.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Roberts D.D. J. Biol.

In RIPA lysates of human melanocytes and Mel Im cells, the processed C-terminal fragment of α4 integrin was detected (Fig. 4C). This processed form was bound by MIA together with a 80-kDa form as seen by silver staining of the co-immunoprecipitates and in the far Western blot. For α5, however, we mainly found the pro-form of the protein in melanocyte RIPA lysates (130–140 kDa). In Mel Im lysates lower bands at ∼70–80 kDa were detected, which presumably reflect the processed forms (see arrows in Fig. 4C). The staining further revealed that only the large form of α5 integrins is present in normal cells, whereas in melanoma cell lines both the unprocessed α5 and the processed forms, are detectable. To verify the results of MIA binding to integrins α4 and α5, ELISA experiments were performed suggesting that MIA is able to directly bind to α4β1 and α5β1, respectively. These data were further supported by FACS analysis using the antibody 12G10 specifically detecting activated integrins. Our data indicate that MIA not only binds to integrins but also down-regulates their activity. Considering the fact that integrins are involved in ERK1/2 signaling (19Juliano R.L. Reddig P. Alahari S. Edin M. Howe A. Aplin A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2004; 32: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), these results confirmed our data that ERK1/2 phosphorylation decreased in melanoma cells after incubation with MIA. To further specify MIA binding to α4β1 and α5β1 we performed competition experiments with the fibronectin fragments 50K and H/120 (a schematic model is depicted in Fig. 8). It is known that 50K contains an RGD site and binds specifically to α5β1; H/120 binds specifically to α4β1 via the connecting segment (IIICS) (14Mostafavi-Pour Z. Askari J.A. Parkinson S.J. Parker P.J. Ng T.T. Humphries M.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We found that the 50K fibronectin fragment competed with MIA binding to α5β1 dose-dependently. It also competed with MIA binding to α4β1, although to a lesser extent. This might be due to the fact that MIA is able to directly bind to the 50K fragment at two different sites (FN6 and the RGD site) (10Bosserhoff A.-K. Stoll R. Sleeman J.P. Bataille F. Buettner R. Holak T.A. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), possibly resulting in sequestration of MIA by the 50K fragment and inhibition of binding to the integrin. Additionally, this hinted to the possibility that the 50K fragment either binds to the same site of the integrins MIA bind to or it covers the MIA-integrin binding epitope. Otherwise, MIA bound by the 50K fragment would also be able to bind to the integrins. Interestingly, when performing the experiments with low concentration of the FN fragment H/120, it did not compete with MIA on α4β1 and α5β1. At higher concentrations it even increased MIA binding mainly to α5β1 integrin. It was shown in previous studies that MIA is able to bind to domains of the H/120 fragment (FN14 and the connecting segment IIICS) (10Bosserhoff A.-K. Stoll R. Sleeman J.P. Bataille F. Buettner R. Holak T.A. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 1583-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Potentially, a complex was formed in which the H/120 fragment (bound by additional MIA molecules) was bound to the integrin α5β1 via MIA. If H/120 binds to MIA without covering the MIA integrin-binding site, MIA would be able to support indirect binding of H/120 to α4β1 integrins. We therefore speculated that the 50K fibronectin fragment blocked the MIA integrin-binding site, whereas the H/120 fibronectin fragment did not interfere with MIA-integrin binding. However, plating the fibronectin fragments first and, as a second step, incubating with MIA and subsequently competing with soluble integrins showed clear competition of MIA with soluble α5β1 on 50K and α4β1 on H/120. Only a slight reduction of MIA binding was found competing binding to 50K with α4β1 or binding to H/120 with α5β1. These results are explained by the fact that α4β1 and 50K and α4β1 and H/120, respectively, do not interact. However, a minor amount of MIA might be sequestered by α4β1or α5β1. Consecutive assays revealed that the regulation of ERK activity by MIA is via direct binding of MIA to integrins. Integrins α4β1 and α5β1 have been shown to play an important role in melanoma development and progression (for review see Ref. 28Kuphal S. Bauer R. Bosserhoff A.K. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2005; 24: 195-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Expression of both has been proven to be elevated in primary and metastatic melanoma (25Moretti S. Martini L. Berti E. Pinzi C. Giannotti B. Melanoma Res. 1993; 3: 235-239PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hartstein M.E. Grove Jr., A.S. Woog J.J. Ophthal. Plast. Reconstr.

Melanoma Res. 2004; 14: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Furthermore, expression of the α4 subunit is associated with melanoma cell accumulation of disseminated cells in distant tissues (27Nikkola J. Vihinen P. Vlaykova T. Hahka-Kemppinen M. Heino J. Pyrhonen S. Melanoma Res. 2004; 14: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). α4β1 is usually expressed as a first step of extravasation to support binding to VCAM-1 expressed on activated endothelial cells. Binding of integrins to matrix proteins is a tightly regulated process. This is best exemplified in migrating cells where cells form a zone of attachment in the front and detachment at the rear. We hypothesize that the control of integrin activity by MIA regulates migration of melanoma cells. In summary, this study revealed that MIA directly interacts with integrin α4β1 and α5β1. This interaction modulates integrin activity and additionally leads to down-regulation of integrin signaling via ERK1/2. We thank Dr. J. Johnson (University of Munich, Munich, Germany) for providing melanoma cell lines and Sibylla Lodermeyer for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2079562848,"The Ras family small GTPase Rap1 is activated by hematopoietic cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-3, to induce beta1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion or by the BCR/ABL fusion tyrosine kinase to stimulate the MEK/Erk signaling pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the abrogation of Rap1 activation by SPA-1, a Rap1-specific GAP, inhibits activation of B-Raf, MEK, Erk, and Akt in a murine hematopoietic cell line, Ton.B210, stimulated with IL-3 or inducibly expressing BCR/ABL. Furthermore, Rap1 inactivation had an inhibitory effects on proliferation and survival of Ton.B210 cells, which were more remarkable when cells were stimulated by BCR/ABL than by IL-3. Induction of BCR/ABL expression increased adhesion of Ton.B210 cells to fibronectin in a manner at least partly dependent on its kinase activity, and Rap1 inhibition by SPA-1 partially inhibited BCR/ABL-induced adhesion of cells. Thus, IL-3- or BCR/ABL-induced activation of Rap1 may play important roles in regulation of cell proliferation and survival through activation of the B-Raf/MEK/Erk and Akt signaling pathways and in induction of integrin-mediated cell adhesion. Furthermore, as compared with IL-3, BCR/ABL is more dependent on Rap1-mediated signaling to induce cell proliferation and survival and, thus, Rap1 may represent an attractive target for novel therapies for leukemias caused by BCR/ABL."

The initial discovery of a proofreading 3′→5′ exonuclease within DNA polymerase I provided the prototype for proofreading among all polymerases (1Brutlag D. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Editing activity was found in the same polypeptide chain as Pol 2The abbreviations used are: Pol, DNA polymerase; Pol III holoenzyme, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ni2+-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; php, polymerase and histidinol phosphatase; SA, streptavidin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The structure of the exonuclease site and functional studies with cross-linked substrates suggested that ∼4 bases needed to be unwound to permit migration of the 3′ end of a primer from the Pol to exonuclease active site (2Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar, 3Cowart M. Gibson K.J. Allen D.J. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 1975-1983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This provided a basis for the preference of the 3′→5′ exonuclease for mispaired over properly base-paired primer termini. Partitioning of the primer terminus between the exonuclease and polymerase sites is determined by both DNA structure and protein contacts (4Bailey M.F. van der Schans E.J. Millar D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 336: 673-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The kinetic basis for efficient proofreading is the very slow rate of elongation of primers containing a terminal mismatch, providing time for partitioning (5Kuchta R.D. Benkovic P. Benkovic S.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6716-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Donlin M.J. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 538-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar).

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar), which demonstrates the close functional relationship between the two activities. Escherichia coli Pol II also contains an exonuclease activity in the same polypeptide chain as the polymerase (7Cai H. Yu H. McEntee K. Kunkel T.A. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Horner D.L. Genetics. 1982; 100: 7-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to Pol I and II, ϵ was shown to be the separate proofreading subunit of the Pol III replicase (10Scheuermann R.

Functional studies within Pol δ support a tight coordination of proofreading and polymerization activities (21Jin Y.H. Garg P. Stith C.M. Al Refai H. Sterling J.F. Murray L.J. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Burgers P.M. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The proofreading activity of ϵ and the polymerase activity of the α subunit of Pol III appear to also be closely coordinated. Binding of ϵ to α stimulates polymerase activity 2-fold and proofreading activity 10-80-fold, depending on the substrate (22Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Studies with mutant ϵ subunits suggest that a functional interaction is required in addition to tight tethering for functional coordination of synthesis with proofreading (23Lehtinen D.A. Perrino F.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and the existence of ϵ and α as separate polypeptide chains provides a convenient experimental system for studying this integration. The usefulness of such an experimental system requires identification of the sites of subunit interaction. It is known that the primary binding energy of ϵ to α is provided by the COOH terminus of ϵ, which is separable from the exonuclease domain (24Taft-Benz S.A. Schaaper R.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2963-2965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McNeill S.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16001-16009Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The position of the ϵ-binding site within α, however, is unknown. To identify regions important for binding, we exploited a series of α subunits from which varying lengths of NH2- and COOH-terminal sequences have been deleted. Using this approach, we localized the site of ϵ binding to the NH2-terminal php domain of α, a region of previously unknown function. Materials—Superflow Ni2+-NTA resin was purchased from Qiagen.

Each tagged protein contained only one significant biotinylated species that was selectively immobilized on streptavidin-coated chips for ϵ binding analysis (Fig. 1). NH2-tagged α subunits carrying point mutations D43A, D43N, and D43E have been described (28Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purification of ϵ—The ϵ subunit of Pol III was obtained using the denaturation-renaturation protocol as described (12Scheuermann R.H. Echols H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7747-7751Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) starting with 10 g cells. The renatured protein (200 mg) was purified using a Q-Sepharose column (70 ml) pre-equilibrated with buffer Q. After loading, the column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer Q containing 50 mm NaCl. The protein was eluted with 10 column volumes in a gradient of 50-150 mm NaCl in buffer Q. The major protein peak, identified as ϵ by SDS gels, was pooled (90 mg). The eluted protein was precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation). One quarter of the pellet (∼22 mg) was dissolved in buffer S (0.5 ml final volume) and applied to a 24-ml Superose-6 column, Amersham Biosciences HR 10/30. The purity of the eluted protein (9.4 mg, 7.1. × 106 units) was determined to be ∼98%, and it was assessed in a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The activity was determined using an exonuclease assay. Assays—The gap-filling assay for Pol III was performed as described (29Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20681-20689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford using the Coomassie Plus Bradford assay reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions (bovine serum albumin as a standard). Exonuclease assays were performed by monitoring the removal of a mispaired 3′-[α-32P]ddAMP. A 29-mer oligonucleotide (AGGCTGGCTGACCTTCATCAAGAGTAATC) was labeled at the 3′ end with [α-32P]ddATP using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. The reaction was carried out in the manufacturer's buffer with the addition of 1.5 μm primer, 1 μm [α-32P]ddATP and 20 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The mixture, in a total volume of 20 μl, was incubated at 30 °C for 40 min. After that, 1 mm non-radioactive ddATP and an additional 10 units of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 40 min at 30 °C. Enzyme was thermally inactivated (10 min, 70 °C). The labeled primer was annealed to M13 Gori template as described (30Griep M.A. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20356-20363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The substrate was purified on a Bio-Gel column equilibrated in buffer B. Concentration of the purified substrate was determined at 260 nm using a conversion factor of A1 = 0.04 mg/ml. 15 μl aliquots of a premix that contained the following components were placed on ice: 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 80 μg/ml BSA, 10 mm DTT, and 114 fmol DNA. After the addition of ϵ, the samples were transferred to 30 °C and incubated for 5 min. 10-μl aliquots were withdrawn, immediately spotted onto DE-81 filters, and washed (three times, 5 min each, in 0.3 m ammonium formate (pH 7.8) + 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate; once in deionized H2O; and once in 95% ethanol). The filters were dried, and the amount of radiolabel remaining was measured by scintillation counting. One unit of exonuclease activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the removal of 1 pmol of nucleotides per minute. Biotin Blots—Biotin blots were used to detect the presence of biotinylated α derivatives. Proteins (0.2-0.4 μg) were separated on a 4-20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 350 mA for 0.5 h using a Bio-Rad mini-apparatus. The membrane was blocked overnight with PBS containing 5% nonfat milk, washed two times with PBS-Tween 0.1% for 10 min, washed once with PBS for 10 min, and incubated in streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at 1:10,000 dilution. The wash steps were repeated, and the sample was incubated for 1 min using ECL Western blotting detection reagents from Amersham Biosciences according to the manufacturer's instructions. The image was obtained by exposing the membrane to x-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL from Amersham Biosciences) for 30 s. α-ϵ Binding Quantitation Using Surface Plasmon Resonance—A Biacore 3000 instrument was used to monitor binding of ϵ to immobilized α derivatives. Tagged α proteins were immobilized on a SA chip via biotin-streptavidin interaction. Typically, three individual flow cells were loaded with ∼500, 1000, and 1500 response units of α subunit. Three different concentrations of ϵ (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 μm) were run over the derivatized SA chip at 20 μl/min in HK buffer at 25 °C. Control injections were performed on underivatized flow cells and were subtracted from the data. The dissociation constant KD for α-ϵ binding was determined using BiaEvaluation 3.2 software, and the curves were fit using the 1:1 Langmuir model. Understanding the Mechanism Used to coordinate the editing activity of the ϵ subunit with the polymerization activity of the α subunit within the E. coli replicase requires knowledge of their respective binding sites. We have previously developed a technique that permits facile identification of protein binding domains. It involves creation of a series of proteins from which progressive deletions have been made from either the NH2 or COOH terminus. The deleted portion is replaced with a tag that is biotinylated in vivo followed by a His6 sequence. The His6 sequence facilitates purification, and the biotinylated tag permits expression analysis in crude mixtures, monitoring of the presence of inactive protein during purification, and tethering of purified protein to streptavidin-coated BIAcore chips, which permits quantification of the strength of their binding to protein partners (26Kim D.R.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4433-4440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The α subunit of Pol III is a long (1160 residues), modular protein. Its central polymerase domain contains three essential catalytic residues that are presumably required to bind the two Mg2+ ions required for catalysis in other polymerases (28Pritchard A.E. McHenry C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). The COOH-terminal end contains the binding sites for τ and two distinct sites for binding β, including the essential internal site (amino acids 920-924) (26Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol.

Georgescu R.E. Goodman M.F. O'Donnell M.E. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Also contained within the COOH-terminal end are HhH and OB fold domains, which have only been predicted by bioinformatics approaches to date (35Doherty A.J. Serpell L.C. Ponting C.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). These motifs are often involved in nucleic acid binding but may also serve as protein-binding sites (36Theobald D.L. Mitton-Fry R.M. Wuttke D.S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2003; 32: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 37Mah T.F. Kuznedelov K. Mushegian A. Severinov K. Greenblatt J.

The NH2-terminal end of α contains a putative domain homologous to histidinol phosphatase and was thus termed the php domain (polymerase and histidinol phosphatase) (39Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3746-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A function for this domain in replication has not been ascribed. ϵ Binds to the php Domain of α Plus a Short COOH-terminal Extension—To permit preliminary identification of the region within α required for binding the ϵ 3′→5′ proofreading exonuclease, we initially surveyed a group of existing tagged α deletions obtained from other studies in our laboratory. We observed that the C-tagged full-length α bound ϵ tightly (KD = 5 nm) (Fig. 2). Deletion of half of the COOH-terminal domain, removing sequences essential for τ binding and the non-essential COOH-terminal β site, did not significantly impair ϵ binding. Similarly, deletion of the entire COOH-terminal domain and of the core of the polymerase domain that contained the essential catalytic Asp residues had no effect (Fig. 2). These observations localized the binding site to the NH2 terminus. We observed that deletion of either 60 residues or 240 residues from the NH2 terminus of the php domain abolished detectable ϵ binding. We know these ϵ binding deficiencies are not due to global folding problems in α because these same mutants bind β and τ with normal affinity (26Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20690-20698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Kim D.R. McHenry C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20699-20704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Placing a tag on the NH2 terminus of full-length α did not change the binding affinity for ϵ (Fig. 2). To carefully assess sequences required for ϵ binding, we constructed α derivatives with more targeted deletions. We exploited the recently determined structure of YcdX, a protein of unknown function that has higher sequence similarity to the php domain of α than the histidinol phosphatates upon which the domain assignment was originally made (40Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Khil P.P. Howard A.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 2003; 51: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Alignments suggested that the end of the php domain may be in the vicinity of residue 255 of the E. coli α sequence or earlier (Fig. 3). Alignments of diverse Pol III α sequences suggest the beginning of the polymerase domain may start near residue 320 of E. coli α (data not shown). Thus, we constructed COOH-tagged proteins containing the predicted minimal php domain (255 residues; CΔ905 α) and this domain plus a COOH-terminal extension of sequence preceding the polymerase domain (320 residues; CΔ840 α). BIAcore binding experiments indicated that the shorter CΔ905 α protein failed to bind ϵ with detectable affinity and that the php protein containing a short COOH-terminal extension, CΔ840 α, bound ϵ with approximately the same affinity as full-length α (Fig. 2). We take this as an indication that all energetically important ϵ-binding sequences are found within the NH2-terminal 320 residues of α. Many of the Zn2+ Ligands Observed in the YcdX Structure Are Conserved in the php Domain of α—Alignment of YcdX and α php domain sequences from diverse organisms indicates sequence similarity around the ligands that chelate Zn2+ 1 and 2 within the YcdX structure (40Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Khil P.P. Howard A.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 2003; 51: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The sequences that bind Zn2+ 3 in YcdX are less conserved in the php domain, but residues that might serve this function were identified and are noted in Fig. 3. In principle, any nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur can serve as a ligand for Zn2+. Typically, these roles are served by His, Glu, Asp, or Cys, but examples of Lys, Tyr, Ser, Thr, the amino terminus of a protein chain, and the carbonyl oxygen of a peptide backbone are known (41Auld D.S. Biometals. 2001; 14: 271-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42Coleman J.E. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 222-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 43McCall K.A. Huang C.

A survey of all completely sequenced bacteria indicates absolute conservation of an acidic residue in the position corresponding to Asp43 within the E. coli α php domain. We examined the binding properties of several Asp43 point mutants and found that this residue is important in binding ϵ. D43A and D43E mutants bound ϵ with 19- and 16-fold reduced affinities, respectively. A D43N mutant bound ϵ only 3-fold more weakly than wild-type (Table 1).TABLE 1Gap filling activities and ϵ binding properties of php mutants DNA polymerase activity was determined by the “gap filling” assay described under “Experimental Procedures.”α mutantPolymerase activity (-fold reduction)KD for α-ϵ bindingaThe KD of ϵ for NH2-tagged α derivatives using a BIAcore is as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that higher concentrations (1 and 3 μm) of ϵ were used to enable quantification of weak bindingnmWild type1.07D43A415130D43E1.0110D43N3.623NΔ60αNot detectableNot detectablea The KD of ϵ for NH2-tagged α derivatives using a BIAcore is as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that higher concentrations (1 and 3 μm) of ϵ were used to enable quantification of weak binding Open table in a new tab The Structure of the php Domain and the Polymerase Activity of α Are Coupled—Modification of the php domain influenced the activity of the adjacent polymerase domain. Deletion of 60 residues from the amino terminus of php destroyed both polymerase catalytic activity and ϵ binding (Table 1). Other mutations affected ϵ binding and polymerase activity differentially. For example, the D43A mutation severely reduced polymerase activity but decreased ϵ binding more modestly. The D43E mutation that did not affect polymerase activity diminished ϵ binding to a similar extent to D43A. A D43N mutation reduced both ϵ binding and polymerase activity to the same small extent. The Exonuclease Domain of Gram(+) Pol C Subunits Is Inserted within the php Domain—The prototypical Gram(+) Pol III, Pol C, contains its proofreading exonuclease within the same subunit as α (44Low R.L. Rashbaum S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alignments of the Pol C sequences with the Pol III α php domain sequences and ϵ sequences show that the php domain is conserved within Pol C sequences, even though the proofreading exonuclease does not need a protein-binding site to secure it to the polymerase (Fig. 4). Pol Cs only contain the NH2-terminal exonuclease domain of the proofreading exonuclease and lack the COOH-terminal α-binding domain found in bacteria that use α as the catalytic subunit of their replicase. Interestingly, the Pol C exonuclease is located internal to php sequences (Fig. 4). Comparing the break in the Pol C php sequence (Fig. 4) with the sequences that follow the acidic ligand that chelates both Zn2+ 2 and 3 in the YcdX structure (Fig. 3), suggests that the insertion may occur in a surface loop in the YcdX structure (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Features pertinent to the interaction of ϵ with the Pol III α php domain indicated on the structure of the homologous YcdX protein. Structural coordinates for YdcX (40Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Khil P.P. Howard A.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 2003; 51: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (1m68). The ribbon representation was prepared using RASMOL. The yellow highlight indicates the 60-residue segment that, when deleted from α, abolishes ϵ binding (residues 1-58 in YcdX). The critical E. coli α Asp43 (Asp39 in YcdX) is rendered in spacefilling mode. A surface loop where ϵ-like sequences appear to be inserted into the homologous Pol C php is shown in red (residues 77-83 in YcdX). The position of the insertion was estimated by alignment of Pol C and α php sequences (Fig. 4) and then alignment of α php and YcdX sequences (Fig. 3). The position of the Zn2+ trinuclear center of YcdX is indicated by the cluster of blue spheres. Many, but not all, Zn2+ ligands are conserved between YcdX and php.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Proofreading and elongation activities within cellular replicases must be highly coordinated to permit efficient error correction and to maintain chromosomal integrity without interfering with fast elongation rates. We plan to exploit the existence of the proofreading exonuclease of the E. coli Pol III holoenzyme as a separate subunit to establish the communication channels required for the coordination of these activities in a prototypical multisubunit replicase. As a first step, we report here that the ϵ subunit binds to the php domain of α immediately upstream from the polymerase domain. This location may permit placement of the exonuclease in a position to permit efficient transfer of mismatched termini from the polymerase. The conserved php domain may help provide a channel for this transfer. Evidence for this hypothesis is provided by the observation of stimulation of proofreading activity up to 80-fold upon binding of ϵ to α (22Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and by the presence of a php domain in Pol C-type Pol IIIs from low GC Gram(+) organisms. Pol C subunits contain polymerase and exonuclease activity as part of the same polypeptide chain (44Low R.L. Rashbaum S.A. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1311-1325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, their php domain is not required for binding a separate ϵ subunit. Therefore, conservation of a php domain and insertion of the proofreading activity within the php domain of Pol Cs suggest a function other than a simple tether for the proofreading domain. Comparison to the homologous YcdX protein, for which a structure has been determined, suggests the insertion occurs in a surface loop that should not significantly perturb the structure of the php domain. The php domain was initially identified by sequence similarity between conserved domains of Pol III subunits and histidinol phosphatase (39Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3746-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). It was noted that a number of conserved residues within this domain could serve as metal ligands. However, the conservation was found not to be absolute, varying at specific positions between species. It was suggested that the domain might provide an enzymatic activity, perhaps a pyrophosphatase helping to drive the energetics of the elongation reaction. More recently, the structure has been determined for a small 245-residue protein, YcdX, that is of unknown function but is more closely related, by sequence, to the php domain of Pol IIIs than histidinol phosphatase. Sequence alignments between Pol III α subunits and YcdX suggest the homologous region within α ends around residue 255. We observed that this predicted minimal php domain fails to bind ϵ. An additional stretch of sequence between the minimal php domain and the polymerase domain is required for binding comparable with that observed for full-length α. This additional sequence element may cooperate separately in ϵ binding or may be part of a larger php domain in Pol III α. Supporting the latter hypothesis, we observe that the longer 320-residue sequence is expressed at higher levels than the minimal 255-residue php domain. It also exhibits lower levels of degradation products in crude cellular extracts, which is consistent with a more compact structure (data not shown). A php- or histidinol phosphatase-like domain has previously been observed at the COOH-terminal end of bacterial Pol βs (39Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3746-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 45Lecointe F. Shevelev I.V. Bailone A. Sommer S. Huebscher U. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1721-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These enzymes are from the X polymerase family and share related polymerase domains with eukaryotic Pols β, λ, and μ and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. We performed a comprehensive psi-BLAST search and confirmed that all bacterial candidates contain a COOH-terminal sequence that aligns with α php (data not shown). This raises the possibility that bacterial Pol βs may also be able to bind cellular ϵ subunits, enabling a coupled proofreading reaction. Such a mechanism would be distinct from eukaryotic β polymerases, which lack a proofreading subunit and exhibit low fidelity (46Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 231-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Alternatively, as suggested solely from bioinformatics and structure comparisons (39Aravind L. Koonin E.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3746-3752Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 40Teplyakov A. Obmolova G. Khil P.P. Howard A.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Gilliland G.L. Proteins. 2003; 51: 315-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the php domain may exhibit an independent activity in these enzymes. However, caution in their investigation is warranted to ensure that any activity observed is not due to trace levels of bound cellular ϵ. Deletion or other php domain mutants may not provide useful controls, since the mutation could abolish ϵ binding rather than any putative intrinsic activity observed. A functional co-dependence of the polymerase and exonuclease activities of Pol III α and ϵ subunits has been observed previously (22Maki H. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 4389-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23Lehtinen D.A. Perrino F.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 384: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Here, we note a similar relationship between the polymerase activity and the php ϵ-binding domain of α. Deletion of the NH2-terminal 60 residues of the php of α abolishes both ϵ binding and polymerase activity. Mutations in the conserved Asp43 affect the two functions to different extents, indicating that the two functions are not absolutely linked. This suggests that the ability to bind ϵ, per se, is not influencing polymerase activity but that the activity of the polymerase domain is influenced by the conformation of the php domain. By microscopic reversibility, this would suggest that the conformation of php could be influenced by the conformation of the polymerase domain. This could create an allosteric mechanism whereby the status of the polymerase active site, modulated by the state of the primer terminus, could activate proofreading activity by altering the conformation of the php domain to facilitate transfer of the primer terminus to the ϵ active site. Clearly, these speculations require further investigation, but the existence of the polymerase and proofreading subunits of Pol III as separate subunits should make such studies much more amenable than would be possible in a single subunit enzyme. Having established the ϵ-binding domain of Pol III and a potential communication mechanism, the Pol III holoenzyme stands to serve as a prototype for revealing how cellular replicases efficiently process replication errors while maintaining the high elongation rate required for chromosomal replication.

These studies demonstrate the existence of pathway-specific mechanisms to control histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation and gene expression. The remodeling of nucleosomes is now accepted as an early, critical step in the inducible activation of transcription of certain genes. A number of posttranslational modifications of histone proteins H3 and H4 have been associated with transcriptional activity of gene promoters. These include methylation of arginine residues, acetylation of lysine residues, and phosphorylation of serine residues (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). Immediate early genes are characterized by rapid induction of transcription in response to a variety of stimuli including mitogens, stress, and cytokines (2Treisman R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4905-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 3Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M. Shaw P.

For example, nucleosomes associated with the c-fos promoter undergo a well characterized series of modifications in response to mitogenic stimuli (5Cheung P. Tanner W.G. Cheung W.L. Sassone-Corsi P.

Similarly, certain cytokine-induced genes undergo similar chromatin modifications associated with inducible gene expression. Specifically, after mitogen or cytokine exposure of cells, these genes undergo rapid histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 and acetylation at lysine 9 (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D.

The regulatory proteins and kinases involved in this rapid, induced nucleosomal modification have been a major focus in this field of study. Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinases 1 and 2 (MSK1/2) 5The abbreviations used are: MSK, mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase; H3-Ser10, histone H3 serine10; IKK, IκB kinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; CREB, cyclic AMP response element-binding protein; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. are nuclear kinases that act downstream of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways (8Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 9Arthur J.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recently, these kinases have been shown to be required for stress-induced phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser10 and transcriptional activation of several immediate early genes (10Soloaga A. Thomson S.

In those studies it was demonstrated that MSK1/2 possess in vitro H3-Ser10 kinase activity. Utilizing either targeted gene disruption or pharmacologic inhibitors, other phosphorylation events involved in the control of target gene expression have been found to depend on MSK1/2, including phosphorylation of CREB and the NF-κB subunit p65 (9Arthur J.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 11Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegemann G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). IKK-α is a kinase component of the IKK complex (12Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar), originally discovered for its ability to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic inhibitor (IκB) of NF-κB in response to a variety of extracellular signals, including hormones and cytokines (12Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3300) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation event directs ubiquitination and destruction of IκB, freeing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. Recently, we and others have shown that IKK-α also translocates to the nucleus and is needed for optimal NF-κB-mediated transcription and histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation of NF-κB target genes in response to cell stimulation with the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) (13Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 659-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 14Yamamoto Y. Verma U. Prajapati S. Kwak Y.-T. Gaynor R. Nature. 2003; 423: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Additional studies have revealed that NF-κB and IKK-α are required for immediate early gene promoter-associated histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation and an optimal transcriptional response of certain immediate early genes in response to the mitogenic growth factor EGF (15Anest V. Cogswell P. Baldwin A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We have provided data that indicate that MSK1/2 are important for EGF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser10 at immediate early response gene promoters and globally on bulk histones. However, MSK1/2 are not involved with the control of cytokine-induced histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation. Furthermore, evidence has been presented for additional roles of MSK1/2 in regulating immediate early gene expression. Finally, we provided evidence that MSK1/2 control EGF-induced histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation on the IκBα promoter in the absence of measurable gene induction.

The following promoter-specific primer pairs were used: primer pair 5′-GAGTTGACGACAGAGCGCC-3′ and 5′-AGAGCAGAGCTGGGTGGGA-3′ were used to amplify the proximal region of the c-fos promoter; primer pair 5′-GAGGACTTTCCAGCCACTCA-3′ and 5′-CTGGCAGGGGATTTCTCAG-3′ were used to amplify the proximal region of the IκBα promoter. Amplified products were run on 2% agarose gels and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to determine the association of phospho-histone H3-Ser10, RNA polymerase II, and phospho-CREB with the c-fos and IκBα promoters. The aforementioned oligonucleotide primers and SYBR Green Master Mix were utilized in conjunction with an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System.

Reactions to quantitate each DNA input, no antibody immunoprecipitation negative control, and experimental samples were performed in triplicate for each independent immunoprecipitation. Independent immunoprecipitations were performed four to six times. Cell lines were serum starved, and at least three independent stimulations with EGF or TNF-α were performed; representative experiments are presented in the figures. Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was prepared from MSK wild-type and MSK1/2 double knock-out MEFs using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. For real-time PCR, the cDNA was prepared with random primer (Invitrogen) and analyzed with triplicate real-time PCR reactions. The TaqMan 2× Universal PCR Master Mix No AmpErase UNG (Roche Applied Science) was used with the following conditions: 15 min at 95 °C for initial denaturing, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 63 °C for 30 s. Applied Biosystems Taqman Assay-On-Demand primer-probe sets were used for c-fos and β-glucuronidase. The oligonucleotide primers used to amplify IκBα transcripts were 5′-AGGATGAGCTGCCCTATGATGA-3′ and 5′-TGCCACTTTCCACTTATAATGTCAGA-3′. The oligonucleotide probe for detection of IκBα amplification products was 5′-6-FAM/TGTGTGTTTGGAGGCCA/36-TAMRA-Sp3′. Reactions were performed on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System. Quantification of transcripts relative to β-glucuronidase transcripts was determined using the ΔΔCt method. Western Blot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed after preparing whole cell extracts and separating proteins (50 μg/lane) by NuPAGE Novex 4-12% Bis Tris gels (Invitrogen) followed by immunoblotting with antibodies as indicated. Extractions of acid-soluble proteins were done according to the protocol described by Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and resolved on 10-20% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels. MSK1 and MSK2 Are Required for Optimal EGF-mediated c-fos Transcriptional Activation—Previously it was shown that MSK1/2 null cells have diminished stress-induced c-fos transcription as compared with wild-type cells (10Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 11: 2788-2797Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether MSK1 and MSK2 were similarly required for transcriptional activation of c-fos in response to EGF. Utilizing a quantitative reverse transcription PCR approach, transcription of c-fos in response to EGF was measured in MSK1/2 null MEFs and their wild-type equivalents (Fig. 1A). The data indicate that MSK1 and MSK2 are important for the efficient induction of c-fos gene expression in response to mitogenic treatment. Because IκBα gene expression had not been reported to be induced significantly by growth factors, we analyzed expression of this gene in response to EGF treatment. EGF stimulation resulted in little change in IκBα mRNA levels in wild-type MEFs, and IκBα mRNA levels were slightly higher in MSK1/2 null MEFs regardless of EGF stimulation status (Fig. 1B). Because changes in gene-specific mRNA levels are regulated by several mechanisms, including transcriptional activation and mRNA degradation, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was used to assess the level of RNA polymerase II associated with the c-fos promoter in response to EGF stimulation. The results demonstrate that MSK1/2 null MEFs have diminished levels of RNA polymerase II associated with the c-fos promoter over the time course of the experiment as compared with wild-type cells (Fig. 1C). Thus, MSK is required for maximal c-fos mRNA accumulation in response to EGF treatment, and this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level. MSK1 and MSK2 Are Required for Optimal TNF-induced c-fos and IκBα Transcriptional Activation—To understand potential roles of MSK1/2 in controlling cytokine-induced transcriptional responses, TNF-stimulated c-fos and IκBα mRNA accumulation was assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. TNF induced a reproducible, modest increase in c-fos mRNA levels, with a peak at the 20-min time point, and MSK1/2 null cells were found to have a significantly blunted response of the induction of this gene in response to TNF when compared with wild-type MEFs (Fig. 2A). As expected, TNF strongly induced IκBα gene expression, and this induction was suppressed ∼50% in the MSK1/2 null cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, MSK1 and MSK2 play an important, but not absolute, role in the transcriptional response of certain genes induced in response to TNF exposure. MSK1 and MSK2 Are Required for EGF-induced, Promoter-specific Histone H3-Ser10 Phosphorylation—Previously, we and others (13Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) have shown that IKK-α is recruited to the IκBα and c-fos promoters in response to TNF-α or EGF and that IKK-α is important for efficient levels of H3-Ser10 phosphorylation and optimal stimulation of transcription from those promoters. MSK1 and MSK2 have also been shown to be required for maximally induced c-fos transcription and H3-Ser10 phosphorylation in response to anisomycin-induced cell stress (10Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 11: 2788-2797Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar). We sought to determine whether MSK1 and MSK2 were also important in both EGF- and TNF-induced, promoter-specific phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser10. First, induction of IκB- and c-fos promoter-associated phospho-histone H3-Ser10 was measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation assays after stimulation with EGF. The results demonstrate that MSK1/2 null MEFs have minimal induction of histone H3-Ser10 in response to EGF at the c-fos promoter as compared with wild-type cells (Figs. 3, A and B). Interestingly, despite no significant transcriptional response of the IκBα gene to EGF in either cell line (see Fig. 1B), EGF stimulation strongly induced histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation at the IκBα promoter that was abolished in the MSK null cell line (Fig. 3, C and D). These results indicate that histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation is not sufficient for the induction of gene expression and that this phosphorylation response can be uncoupled from transcription. Additionally, these data indicate that MSK1/2 are essential for growth factor-induced histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation, at least as measured at two inducible promoters. Interestingly, there was no appreciable difference in the TNF-induced phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone H3 at the c-fos (Fig. 4, A and B) and IκBα promoters (Fig. 4, C and D) in MSK1/2 null cells as compared with wild-type cells. These results demonstrate that MSK1/2 are not involved with the regulation of TNF-induced histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation at certain known TNF-responsive promoters. The role of MSK1/2 in contributing to TNF-induced c-fos and IκBα gene expression may be explained through its proposed role in controlling p65 phosphorylation (11Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegemann G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). MSK1/2 Are Required for Global Levels of Phosphorylated Histone H3-Ser10 in Response to EGF but Not TNF—To address global aspects of EGF- and TNF-induced phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser10, we analyzed total histone preparations for levels of this specific modification. Histones were extracted, electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and probed with histone H3-Ser10 phospho-specific antibody. The results demonstrate that global levels of histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation are strongly reduced in response to EGF, but not to TNF, in the MSK1/2 null cells as compared with the wild-type cells (Fig. 5). Thus, these data demonstrate that MSK1 and MSK2 play a vital role in EGF-mediated histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation. They also demonstrate that kinases other than MSK1/2 play a role in histone H3 phosphorylation in response to cytokine stimulation. EGF-induced Accumulation of Promoter-associated Phospho-CREB Requires MSK1 and MSK2 and Correlates with Transcriptional Activation of EGF-responsive Genes—Although histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation is an important step in chromatin remodeling and inducible transcription, we sought to determine whether other regulatory events controlled in an MSK-dependent fashion might relate to the EGF-induced transcription of the c-fos gene. The cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a known transactivator of c-fos gene transcription and also is a substrate of MSK1 and MSK2 (8Deak M. Clifton A.D. Lucocq J.M. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar, 9Arthur J.S. Cohen P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 482: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Montiminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). After stimulation with EGF, immunoblot analysis of whole cell extracts reveals that the MSK1/2 null MEFs have dramatically lower levels of phospho-CREB when compared with wild-type counterparts (Fig. 6A), as expected. Importantly this lack of phosphorylated CREB is reflected at the c-fos promoter where chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrates induction of c-fos promoter-associated phospho-CREB was reduced in MSK1/2 null MEFs (Fig. 6, B and C). Phospho-CREB was not recruited to the IκBα promoter in either wild-type or MSK1/2 null cells after EGF stimulation (Fig. 6D), suggesting that the presence of phosphorylated CREB and perhaps other MSK-phosphorylated transcription factors at the c-fos promoter may play a significant role in the control of c-fos gene expression. Consistent with reports of others (17Zhang X. Odom D.T. Koo S.-H. Conkright M.D. Canettieri G. Best J. Chen H. Jenner R. Herbolsheimer E. Jacobsen E. Kadam S. Ecker J.R. Emerson B. Hogenesch J.B.

Cell. 2004; 119: 1041-1054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar), CREB was found constitutively associated with its regulatory element. Thus the loss of histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation seen in the MSK1/2 null cells at the c-fos promoter may account only partly for the loss of the gene expression response (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the strong induction of H3-Ser10 phosphorylation observed at the IκBα promoter in response to EGF treatment without significant transcriptional activation is likely to reflect the broad control of MSK1/2 in regulating EGF-induced H3-Ser10 phosphorylation and also the lack of recruitment of a sequence-specific EGF- and/or MSK1/2-regulated transcription factor to this promoter. Our current studies have revealed three interesting results regarding the role of MSK1 and MSK2 in transcriptional regulation and nucleosomal remodeling in response to extracellular stimuli. First, as had been previously noted for stress signaling pathways (10Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 11: 2788-2797Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar), MSK1 and MSK2 are also required for in vivo histone H3 phosphorylation at serine 10 in response to EGF. These conclusions are based on both promoter-specific and global experiments. Second, optimal TNF-mediated transcriptional activation of IκBα also requires MSK1 and MSK2, although these kinases do not play a role in histone H3 phosphorylation at the promoters of certain TNF-responsive genes. Finally, our data indicate that MSK1/2 induce H3-Ser10 phosphorylation at the IκBα promoter in response to EGF stimulation in the absence of increased IκBα gene expression. Phosphorylation of histone H3-Ser10 is a known early step in chromatin remodeling and has been shown to be important during chromosomal replication (1Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar). More recently, this modification has been found to be associated with rapidly inducible promoters. Both IKK-α and MSK1/2 have been implicated as kinases responsible for targeted H3 phosphorylation preceding transcriptional activity (10Soloaga A. Thomson S. Wiggin G. Rampersaud N. Dyson M. Hazzalin C. Mahadevan L. Arthur J.S. EMBO J. 2003; 11: 2788-2797Crossref Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 13Anest V. Hanson J. Cogswell P. Steinbrecher K. Strahl B. Baldwin A.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31183-31189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Our current data support a role for MSK1/2 in EGF-induced H3-serine 10 phosphorylation, but not in TNF induction of this modification. Our current studies are unable to establish whether MSK1 and MSK2 act directly as H3 kinases after EGF stimulation or whether these kinases simply lie in the kinase pathway that leads to this modification. Similarly, it is unclear what the role of IKK-α is in the EGF-induced pathway to control EGF-induced H3-Ser10 phosphorylation. One possibility is that IKK-α could regulate MSK1/2 downstream of EGF-induced, but not TNF-induced, signaling. Surprisingly, our current studies reveal that MSK-dependent histone H3-Ser10 phosphorylation occurs on both transcriptionally active and inactive promoters in response to EGF. This suggests that promoter-specific H3-Ser10 phosphorylation is not sufficient to induce transcription of the target gene. Thus, the data are consistent with the involvement of MSK1/2 in controlling inducible H3-Ser10 phosphorylation on certain available promoters. The distinction between a role for MSK1/2 in c-fos and IκBα gene expression is likely to relate to the MSK-dependent phosphorylation of CREB that contributes to the transcriptional transactivation of c-fos gene in response to EGF. Presumably the IκBα gene lacks a target sequence for an EGF-induced, MSK1/2-regulated factor, and consequently the gene is not activated. Although MSK1/2 have been implicated in controlling phosphorylation of the RelA/p65 subunit on Ser276 in response to cytokine treatment (11Vermeulen L. De Wilde G. Van Damme P. Vanden Berghe W. Haegemann G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1313-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), it is possible that either EGF does not induce this response or this phosphorylation is not sufficient to induce IκBα transcription, explaining the uncoupling of H3-Ser10 phosphorylation from transcriptional activation. Additionally, the observed role for MSK1/2 downstream of TNF in contributing to c-fos and IκBα gene expression without affecting H3-Ser10 phosphorylation may relate to the reported ability of MSK1/2 to phosphorylate the RelA/p65 subunit, a factor known to regulate both c-fos and IκBα gene expression (12Ghosh S.

https://openalex.org/W2058307008,"We previously showed that conformational activation of the anticoagulant serpin, antithrombin, by heparin generates new exosites in strand 3 of β-sheet C, which promote the reaction of the inhibitor with the target proteases, factor Xa and factor IXa. To determine which residues comprise the exosites, we mutated strand 3C residues that are conserved in all vertebrate antithrombins. Combined mutations of the three conserved surface-accessible residues, Tyr253,Glu255, and Lys257, or of just Tyr253 and Glu255, but not any of these residues alone, was sufficient to reproduce the exosite defects of a strand 3C antithrombin-α1-proteinase inhibitor chimera in reactions of the heparin-activated variants with both factor Xa and factor IXa. Importantly, the exosite-defective antithrombins bound heparin with nearly wild-type affinities, and the heparin-activated mutants showed near normal reactivities with thrombin, a protease that does not utilize the exosite. Mutation of the conserved but partially buried strand 3C residue, Gln254, the reactive loop P6′ residue, Arg399, which interacts with Glu255, or a residue proposed to constitute the exosite from modeling studies, Glu237, all produced minimal effects on antithrombin reactivity with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa in the absence or presence of heparin. Together, these results indicate that Tyr253 and Glu255 are key exosite determinants responsible for promoting the reactions of conformationally activated antithrombin with both factor Xa and factor IXa.

Antithrombin, a member of the serpin superfamily of protein protease inhibitors, functions as a key anticoagulant regulator of blood clotting proteases in vertebrates (1Björk I. Olson S.T.

It inhibits its main target clotting proteases, thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol.

In this mechanism, the protease recognizes and binds an exposed reactive loop of the serpin and proceeds to cleave a reactive bond in the loop to generate a covalent serpin-protease acyl-intermediate as in a regular serine protease substrate reaction. However, major conformational changes of both the serpin and protease are induced at this stage that arrest further cleavage of the bond and stabilize the acyl-intermediate complex. In these changes, the N-terminal end of the cleaved serpin-reactive loop inserts into the major β-sheet of the serpin core, the A sheet, dragging the acyl-linked protease along with it to the opposite end of the serpin, where steric forces distort and inactivate the protease catalytic machinery (6Huntington J.A.

Antithrombin is unusual among serpins in that its reactions with its target clotting proteases are unusually slow and require the sulfated polysaccharide, heparin, to accelerate them to the physiologically significant diffusion limit. The acceleration of antithrombin-protease reactions by heparin results from the polysaccharide binding to the serpin through a unique pentasaccharide sequence and inducing an activating conformational change in the protein (2Olson S.T.

Commun. 1983; 116: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The conformational change greatly increases the affinity of antithrombin for heparin and disrupts an intramolecular reactive loop-sheet A interaction to allow full exposure of the loop in a manner like that of other serpins (12Huntington J.A.

One puzzling aspect of the function of antithrombin has been its ability to target three clotting proteases with very different substrate specificities. Whereas it was initially thought that the determinants of the antithrombin specificity for thrombin, factor Xa and factor IXa, were encoded in the reactive loop sequence and that heparin activation served to make this sequence accessible to protease, later studies proved that this was not the case. Mutagenesis of the reactive loop sequence, particularly the conserved P2-P1′ residues, was thus shown to cause marked changes in the reactivity of antithrombin with proteases in the absence of heparin but to have little effect on the heparin enhancement of this reactivity (3Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 15Chuang Y.-J. Swanson R. Raja S.M. Bock S.C. Olson S.T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 14961-14971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Such findings suggested that the reactive loop sequence only provided the determinants of the slow reactivity of antithrombin with its three target proteases in the absence of heparin and that the heparin enhancement of this reactivity resulted from the generation of new exosites that promoted the interaction of the three target proteases with the inhibitor (17Olson S.T. Chuang Y.-J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2002; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These exosites were made accessible on antithrombin upon conformational activation by the heparin pentasaccharide in the case of factors Xa and IXa, whereas additional exosites on heparin outside the pentasaccharide acted to further promote the antithrombin-protease interaction by bridging the two proteins in a ternary complex for all three target proteases (3Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol.

To prove the existence of the hypothesized exosites on antithrombin, which interact with factors Xa and IXa, we used a chimeric approach in which linear regions of antithrombin circumscribing the reactive loop were substituted with the homologous regions of α1-proteinase inhibitor, a serpin not activated by heparin (21Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Of six chimeras prepared, one was shown to be defective in the rate enhancement produced by heparin pentasaccharide of the antithrombin reaction with both factors Xa and IXa. These results thus suggested that an exosite, specific for both factors Xa and IXa, resides in strand 3 of β-sheet C just below the serpin reactive loop. The aim of the present study was to further localize the exosite to specific amino acid residues in strand 3C. Our results demonstrate that two residues in this strand, Tyr253 and Glu255, which are completely conserved in the 13 vertebrate antithrombins that have been sequenced (22Backovic M. Gettins P.G.W. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), are critical determinants of this exosite and responsible for mediating the rapid inhibition of factors Xa and IXa by heparin-activated antithrombin. Construction, Expression, and Purification of Wild Type and Variant Antithrombins—Recombinant antithrombin variants were constructed on an N135Q background to block glycosylation of Asn135 and thereby prevent the heparin binding heterogeneity that results from incomplete glycosylation at this site (1Björk I.

Corrections were made for small amounts of inactive, presumably latent, antithrombin in some variants based on the results of stoichiometric titrations of thrombin with the variants (see below). Proteases and Heparin—Human α-thrombin was prepared by activating purified prothrombin (25Miletich J.P. Broze G.J. Jr-Majerus P.W. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 221-228Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with a snake venom activator followed by purification of the active protease as described (26Owen W.G. Jackson C.M. Thromb. Res. 1973; 3: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Human factor Xa (a mixture of α and β forms) and factor IXaβ were obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). A synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin binding sequence in heparin was provided by Dr. Maurice Petitou (Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France). A full-length heparin with reduced polydispersity, having a chain-length of about 50 saccharides and containing the pentasaccharide binding sequence, was prepared from commercial heparin by size exclusion and affinity chromatography on antithrombin-agarose as described (27Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Concentrations of heparins were obtained by stoichiometric binding titrations of plasma antithrombin with the polysaccharides monitored from the 35-40% enhancement in tryptophan fluorescence, which reports binding as in previous studies (27Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Stoichiometric binding conditions were achieved by using antithrombin concentrations at least 10 times the KD for the interaction. Human antithrombin was purified from blood plasma as in previous studies (27Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE—The purity of recombinant antithrombins and their ability to form SDS-stable complexes with proteases was evaluated by SDS-PAGE using 10% acrylamide gels and the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Experimental Conditions—Antithrombin-protease reaction stoichiometries and kinetics were done at 25 °C in either 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, buffer for reactions with thrombin and factor Xa or in 100 mm Hepes, 0.095 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4, buffer for reactions with factor IXa. The ionic strength of both buffers was 0.15. Heparin Binding to Antithrombin Variants—Equilibrium binding of the heparin pentasaccharide to recombinant antithrombins was evaluated by titrating antithrombin, at a concentration close to the KD for the binding interaction, with the pentasaccharide and monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence enhancement, which reports binding as in prior studies (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the tight binding of recombinant antithrombin to heparin at physiologic ionic strength, binding studies were conducted in the phosphate buffer used for studying antithrombin-protease reactions but at a higher ionic strength (I = 0.35, attained by adjusting the NaCl concentration to 0.3 m) to allow more accurate measurements of KD. Fluorescence titrations were computer-fit by the quadratic equilibrium binding equation assuming a 1:1 binding stoichiometry to determine values for KD and the maximal fluorescence change (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stoichiometry of Antithrombin-Protease Reactions—The stoichiometries for the reactions of recombinant antithrombins with thrombin and factor Xa were determined as described previously (27Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Briefly, to fixed concentrations of 100 nm protease was added increasing concentrations of inhibitor to give molar ratios of inhibitor to protease of up to 1.6 in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were done both in the absence and presence of the full-length heparin, which was fixed at a concentration equimolar with the protease. After incubating for times sufficient to complete the reaction (>95%), 4 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 1 ml of substrate (100 μm S-2238 for thrombin or 100 μm Spectrozyme FXa for factor Xa), and the residual enzymatic activity was measured from the initial linear rate of change of absorbance at 405 nm. The decrease in protease activity with increasing molar ratio of inhibitor/protease was fit by linear regression to obtain the stoichiometry from the abscissa intercept. Kinetics of Antithrombin-Protease Reactions—Association rate constants for reactions of recombinant antithrombins with proteases in the absence or presence of pentasaccharide or full-length heparins were measured under pseudo-first order conditions by using at least a 10-fold molar excess of inhibitor over protease as in previous studies (3Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 21Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For reactions with all proteases in the absence of heparin and those reactions with proteases in the presence of pentasaccharide whose rate constants were 104 m-1 s-1 or less (or in some cases as high as 105 m-1 s-1), full reaction time courses of the loss of enzyme activity were obtained and fit by a single exponential function with a zero activity end point. Pentasaccharide was present in these full time course experiments at levels that saturated antithrombin. A nonzero end point was used for factor IXa reactions due to a small amount of degraded protease in the preparation (<5%), which was resistant to being inhibited (3Bedsted T. Swanson R. Chuang Y.-J. Bock P.E. Björk I. Olson S.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 8143-8152Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Assays of residual enzyme activity were done by removing aliquots of the reaction at different times, diluting into appropriate chromogenic or fluorogenic substrates, and measuring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis as in previous studies (20Yang L. Manithody C. Rezaie A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50756-50760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Association rate constants for free antithrombin or antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex reactions were obtained from fitted exponential rate constants by dividing by the concentration of antithrombin. For all other reactions in the presence of pentasaccharide or full-length heparins, reactions were done for a fixed time as a function of the concentration of heparin, and the loss in enzyme activity was fit by a single exponential function with heparin concentration instead of time as the independent variable (21Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The association rate constant for the reaction of the antithrombin-heparin complex was obtained from the fitted exponential rate constant by dividing by the fixed reaction time and by a factor that corrected for the fraction of heparin that was bound by antithrombin. Mutagenesis Strategy for Mapping the Putative Antithrombin Exosite— We previously showed that an exosite that enhances the reactivity of antithrombin with factors Xa and IXa following activation of the inhibitor by a specific heparin pentasaccharide is localized to strand 3 of β-sheet C of the serpin just underneath the reactive center loop (Fig. 1) (21Izaguirre G. Zhang W. Swanson R. Bedsted T. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51433-51440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To further pinpoint which of the eight altered residues in the strand 3C antithrombin-α1-protease inhibitor chimera was responsible for the observed exosite defect of the chimera, we focused our attention on those residues that are exposed on the protein surface and are highly conserved in the 13 vertebrate antithrombins that have been sequenced (22Backovic M. Gettins P.G.W. J. Proteome Res. 2002; 1: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Three highly conserved surface residues in strand 3C, Tyr253, Glu255, and Lys257, and a conserved but less surface-accessible residue, Gln254, were selected for mutation (Fig. 1). Additional mutations of another highly conserved residue in the reactive loop, Arg399, which appeared to interact with the conserved strand 3C residues in the x-ray structure of heparin-activated antithrombin and a residue implicated by modeling to be part of a factor Xa exosite, Glu237 (29Huntington J.A. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1535-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), were also made (Fig. 1). Antithrombin variants were all expressed at a level similar to the wild-type protein. Purification of the variants by heparin-agarose chromatography showed that they all bound and were eluted from the heparin matrix at a salt concentration reasonably close to that of the wild-type inhibitor, indicating wild type-like affinities for heparin. After an additional ionic exchange chromatography step on monoQ, the variants were >95% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis. All antithrombin mutants were found to inhibit thrombin enzymatic activity and selected exosite-defective mutants were shown to inhibit factor Xa activity in the absence or presence of heparin with stoichiometries indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (Table 1 and data not shown). Only in a few cases were thrombin inhibition stoichiometries in the absence of heparin slightly elevated above 1, indicative of a small amount of inactive latent inhibitor in the preparation (23Arocas V. Bock S.C. Raja S.M. Olson S.T. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43809-43817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The elevated stoichiometries observed in the presence of heparin are due to enhancement of a competing substrate reaction of the inhibitor with the protease (30Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10153-10160Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that all mutants formed SDS-stable equimolar complexes with thrombin, and selected exosite-defective mutants were observed to form complexes with factor Xa (Fig. 2) and with factor IXa (not shown) indistinguishable from the complexes formed with the wild-type inhibitor. Equilibrium binding of the heparin pentasaccharide activator to the mutant antithrombins, measured from the ∼40% intrinsic fluorescence increase that reports binding and activation (2Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), showed that the fluorescence increase and binding affinities for pentasaccharide were not greatly perturbed from that of the wild-type inhibitor (Table 1). To determine which of the conserved strand 3C antithrombin residues corresponded to the factor Xa and factor IXa-specific exosite, association rate constants for the reactions of wild-type and mutant antithrombins with thrombin, factor Xa, and factor IXa in the absence and presence of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins were determined (Fig. 3 and Table 2).TABLE 1Dissociation constants and maximal fluorescence changes for heparin pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin variants and stoichiometries of inhibition (SI) for the reaction of antithrombin variants with thrombin in the absence and presence of full-length heparin Dissociation constants and maximal fluorescence changes for antithrombin-pentasaccharide interactions were measured by fluorescence titrations at pH 7.4, I = 0.35, 25 °C. Stoichiometries of inhibition for antithrombin-thrombin reactions were determined by endpoint titrations at pH 7.4, I = 0.15, 25 °C.

https://openalex.org/W2010789517,"Drak2 is a death-associated protein family serine-threonine kinase. Its expression and roles in the immune system were investigated in this study. According to in situ hybridization, Drak2 expression was ubiquitous at the mid-gestation stage in embryos, followed by more focal expression in various organs in the perinatal period and adulthood, notably in the thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, cerebellum, suprachiasmatic nuclei, pituitary, olfactory lobes, adrenal medulla, stomach, skin, and testes. Drak2 transgenic (Tg) mice were generated using the human β-actin promoter. These Tg mice showed normal T cell versus B cell and CD4 versus CD8 populations in the spleen, but their spleen weight cellularity was lower in comparison with wild type mice. After TCR activation, the proliferation response in Drak2 Tg T cells was normal, although their interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-4 but not interferon-γ production was augmented. Activated Drak2 Tg T cells demonstrated significantly enhanced apoptosis in the presence of exogenous IL-2. At the molecular level, Drak2 Tg T cells manifested a lower increase of anti-apoptotic factors during activation; such a change probably rendered the cells vulnerable to subsequent IL-2 insults. The compromised apoptosis in Drak2 Tg T cells was associated with reduced numbers of T cells with the memory cell phenotype (CD62Llo) and repressed secondary T cell responses in delayed type hypersensitivity. Our study demonstrates that Drak2 expresses in the T cell compartment but is not T cell-specific; it plays critical roles in T cell apoptosis and memory T cell development."

RNA polymerase III is responsible for the transcription of some 300 different genes in yeast, encoding mostly tRNAs (1Harismendy O. Gendrel C.G. Soularue P. Gidrol X. Sentenac A. Werner M.

DNA-bound TFIIIC directs the assembly of TFIIIB, upstream of the transcription start site, and TFIIIB in turn recruits RNA polymerase III for multiple transcription cycles. Transcription of eukaryotic class III genes is a variation of this scheme that involves a cascade of protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions (4Geiduschek E.P. Kassavetis G.A. J. Mol.

TFIIIB is able to assemble autonomously in vitro, via the interaction of TBP with the strong TATA box of the SNR6 gene (23Moenne A. Camier S. Anderson G. Margottin F. Beggs J. Sentenac A.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11938-11942Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, yeast TFIIIC did not show any detectable histone acetyltransferase activity (6Chedin S. Ferri M.L. Peyroche G. Andrau J.C. Jourdain S. Lefebvre O. Werner M. Carles C. Sentenac A. Cold Spring Harb. Symp.

It is still possible, however, that additional components may be needed to reach the high transcription rates observed in vivo. Indeed, efficient transcription of the SNR6 gene, which has a degenerate A block and a distant B block located downstream of the termination signal, was shown to require the Nhp6 proteins in vivo and in vitro (33Kruppa M. Moir R.D. Kolodrubetz D. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 309-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 34Lopez S. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Jourdain S. Thoma F. Sentenac A. Marsolier M.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3096-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). There was also the intriguing observation that recombinant Bdp1 directed accurate transcription of the SUP4 tRNA gene at a low level and needed to be supplemented with TFIIIE to fully restore the transcription level obtained with purified B″ fraction (31Ruth J. Conesa C. Dieci G. Lefebvre O. Dusterhoft A. Ottonello S. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1941-1949Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). TFIIIE factor activity has not yet been characterized, and its mode of action is still unclear (35Dieci G. Duimio L. Coda-Zabetta F. Sprague K.U. Ottonello S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11199-11207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Ultimately, future advances in the definition and analyses of the RNA polymerase III transcription system will require its reconstitution with recombinant proteins. As a step toward this goal, we describe here the reconstitution of functional TFIIIC by expression of its subunits in insect cells. The τA and the τB domains of the factor could be produced independently and analyzed. The transcription system reconstituted with recombinant TFIIIC, recombinant TFIIIB, and highly purified RNA polymerase III directed a level of specific transcription similar to the one obtained with affinity-purified endogenous TFIIIC.MATERIALS AND METHODSProduction and Expression of Recombinant Baculoviruses—The open reading frame of FLAG-τ138, HA-τ 95, τ 91, τ 60, τ 55, or Brf1–His were inserted in PVL1392 vector (Pharmingen) and then recombined with baculovirus DNA (Bacvector 3000 DNA; Novagen) in Spodoptera frugiperda (SF9 cells). The recombinant viruses were plaque-purified, and viral stocks were prepared by three-step growth amplifications. The open reading frames of τ138, His-τ131, and τ 60-His were subcloned in a pFastbac1 vector (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids were used for bacmid production according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). High Five cells (typically 2 × 107 cells) were infected with one baculovirus or co-infected with combinations of recombinant baculoviruses (from two to six) as indicated. Multiplicities of infection were adjusted so as to balance the amount of recombinant proteins simultaneously expressed from each virus. The cells were collected 72 h postinfection. The protein extracts were prepared as described (36Dumay-Odelot H. Acker J. Arrebola R. Sentenac A. Marck C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar).Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—Preparation of rτA.

The three polypeptides were co-purified successively by anti-HA-tag affinity column (Sigma) followed by GSH affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) chromatography to yield the rτA subcomplex (according to the manufacturer's instructions).Preparation of rτB—High Five cell extract co-expressing FLAG-τ138, τ91, and τ60-His was subjected to chromatography on heparin Hyper D (Biosepra) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™; Roche Applied Science). The proteins were eluted with a 30-column volume linear gradient of NaCl from 0.1 to 1 m. The fractions were then tested in gel shift assay using tDNA3Leu gene as a probe (see below). rTFIIICa and rTFIIICb were purified from High Five cells (2 × 109 cells) co-expressing τ138, His-τ131, HA-τ95, τ91, τ60, and τ55, using the Sprint Biocad system (Applied Biosystem) at 10 ml/min. The extracts, prepared in buffer B0 (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 20% glycerol, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitor mixture) containing 40 mm ammonium sulfate (AS), were first adjusted to 250 mm AS and then loaded onto a 35-ml heparin HyperD column previously equilibrated with the same buffer. The resin was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B0 containing 360 mm AS. A 15-column volume linear gradient of AS from 360 to 750 mm was then applied. Fractions were collected and assayed for TFIIIC-DNA binding activity (see below). rTFIIICa (fractions 30–40) or rTFIIICb (fractions 60–80) were pooled separately, adjusted to 550 mm AS, and subjected to fast liquid chromatography in a 0.8-ml Poros MC 20 (Applied Biosystem) column charged with Cobalt. rTFIIICa or rTFIIICb were eluted with buffer B0 containing 40 mm AS and 300 mm imidazole (pH adjusted to 8).His-TBP (36Dumay-Odelot H. Acker J. Arrebola R. Sentenac A. Marck C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and His-Brf1 were expressed in High Five cells and purified successively by metal chelate chromatography on Poros MC 20 loaded with nickel and heparin chromatography (Poros 20 HE; Applied Biosystem). rBdp1 was prepared as described (37Ferrari R. Rivetti C. Acker J. Dieci G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 13442-13447Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).DNA Binding and in Vitro Transcription Assays—TFIIIC-DNA interactions were monitored by gel shift assays as described previously (38Jourdain S.

The amounts of proteins used in the various gel shift assays were as follows: affinity-purified rTFIIIC (10 ng), heparin-purified rTFIIIC (50 ng), heparin-purified rτB (30 ng), and Mono Q endogenous TFIIIC (100 ng). The final KCl concentration was adjusted to 180 mm instead of 120 mm (used with TFIIIC) when rτB was assayed. The limited proteolysis assays were performed as described (12Deprez E. Arrebola R. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8042-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), using 50 ng of heparin-purified rτB or 150 ng of Mono Q-purified endogenous TFIIIC (38Jourdain S. Acker J. Ducrot C. Sentenac A.

The apparent dissociation constant (Kapp) of rTFIIICa-, rTFIIICb-, or yTFIIIC-tDNA3Leu complexes was determined as described previously (38Jourdain S. Acker J. Ducrot C. Sentenac A. Lefebvre O. J.

As estimated by SDS-PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Blue staining, 0.5 μg of the crude B″ fraction used provide no more than 20 ng of Bdp1 polypeptide. When 5 S RNA gene was transcribed, 40 ng of purified rTFIIIA (40Ottonello S. Ballabeni A. Soncini C. Dieci G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 1217-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) was added to the transcription mixture. The transcriptions reactions were allowed to proceed for 45 min at 25 °C, and the transcripts were analyzed by electrophoresis on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel.To analyze the initiation of transcription, a 17-mer assay was performed as described previously (41Chedin S. Riva M. Schultz P. Sentenac A. Carles C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3857-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Stable ternary complexes were formed by incubating the transcriptions proteins (same amount as for the standard in vitro transcription presented in this study) for 20 min at 25 °C. Purified RNA Pol III, ATP, CTP, and α-32P-labeled UTP were then added, and the transcription was allowed to proceed for 20 min at 25 °C. The reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gel.Footprint—Binding reactions were calibrated using heparin-purified rτB or Mono Q-purified endogenous TFIIIC (38Jourdain S. Acker J. Ducrot C. Sentenac A. Lefebvre O. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10450-10457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) to obtain a complete retardation of the probe. The TFIIIC-DNA complexes obtained were then subjected to DNase protection as described (42Camier S. Gabrielsen O. Baker R. Sentenac A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the DNA fragments were resolved on an 8% polyacrylamide sequencing gel.Phosphatase Treatments—Potato acid phosphatase (PAP; Fluka) in ammonium sulfate suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C and dissolved in PPA buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6, 100 mm NaCl, and 3mm MgCl2) at a final concentration of 0.5 unit/μl. 50 ng of heparin-purified rTFIIIC, 15 ng of affinity-purified rTFIIIC, or 150 ng of Mono Q purified endogenous yTFIIIC were incubated with increasing amounts of PAP (from 0.025 to 0.75 unit) as indicated, or bovine serum albumin in PPA buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. Phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma) was then added at a 1:20 dilution to the reaction mixtures before DNA binding or in vitro transcription assays.Southwestern Blot—The Southwestern blot was performed as previously described (39Huet J. Conesa C. Carles C. Sentenac A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18341-18349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly 5–10 μg of each purified protein was subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE and blotted to nitrocellulose. The filters were first washed with the a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl and then incubated for 30 min with 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 2.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1% (w/v) gelatin, 40 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). After a 30-min prehybridization period with 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, containing 40 mm NaCl, 0.05% (w/v) gelatin, the filters were then incubated for 1 h at 4°C with the same buffer C in the presence of a 32P-labeled (106 cpm/ml) alternating copolymer poly(dA-dT) from Sigma. Finally, the membrane was washed three times for 5 min with binding buffer, and the labeled polypeptides were revealed by autoradiography.RESULTSCharacterization of the Two Structural Domains of TFIIIC—To attempt the in vivo assembly of yeast TFIIIC, we constructed various recombinant baculoviruses for directing the production of each individual TFIIIC subunit in insect cells. The six subunits were overexpressed quite efficiently, without much noticeable proteolysis (data not shown). Some subunits were epitope-tagged to allow affinity purification of protein complexes. In co-expression experiments to produce partial or complete TFIIIC, insect cells were co-infected with appropriate amounts of viruses so as to co-express a similar level of each subunit. Next, we looked for protein assemblies that could form stable complexes with tDNA. High Five cells were co-infected with various combinations of recombinant baculoviruses to produce the six polypeptides (τ138, GST-τ131, HA-τ95, τ91, τ60, and τ55) or all possible combinations of five subunits. All of the polypeptides were present in similar amounts in the different extracts, as shown by immunoblotting (Fig. 1).In gel retardation assays using crude cell extracts, two complexes of different migration rates were detected (data not shown). The larger one was only present when all six subunits were co-expressed, whereas the quickly migrating one was detected when τ138, τ91, and τ60 were coexpressed (data not shown). This complex was likely related to the τB protease-resistant complex previously characterized with TFIIIC preparations subjected to limited proteolysis (8Marzouki N. Camier S. Ruet A. Moenne A. Sentenac A. Nature. 1986; 323: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Indeed, τ138 was shown to be part of the protease-resistant τB domain (10Gabrielsen O.S. Marzouki N. Ruet A. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7505-7511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and biochemical studies have suggested that τ91 and τ60 also belonged to this DNA-binding subcomplex (11Arrebola R. Manaud N. Rozenfeld S. Marsolier M.C. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Thuriaux P. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Deprez E. Arrebola R. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8042-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 16Bartholomew B. Kassavetis G.A. Braun B.R. Geiduschek E.P. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2197-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We therefore attempted to reconstitute the minimal rτB module using full-length polypeptides. Insect protein extracts containing recombinant FLAG-τ138, τ91, or τ60-His expressed either alone or in combination were partially purified by chromatography on a heparin column, and the fractions, eluted by a salt gradient, were analyzed by gel shift assays (Fig. 2A and data not shown). No protein-DNA complex was formed using the fractions from a control cell extract, indicating that no insect proteins were able to form a stable complex with the yeast tRNA probe under the rather stringent binding conditions used (125 mm KCl and 300 ng of competitor DNA; data not shown). Using extracts expressing one subunit, we only detected DNA binding activity with τ91. The nonspecific DNA binding activity of τ91 was previously reported (11Arrebola R. Manaud N. Rozenfeld S. Marsolier M.C. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Thuriaux P. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although τ91 was found to cooperate with τ138 for DNA binding (11Arrebola R. Manaud N. Rozenfeld S. Marsolier M.C. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Thuriaux P. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these subunits did not appear to assemble strongly (data not shown). On the contrary, τ91 and τ60 can form a stable complex that could represent the scaffold of the τB subcomplex (14Mylona A. Acker J. Fernandez-Tornero C. Sentenac A. Muller C.W. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 45: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, no specific DNA binding activity could be detected with this pair of subunits. In fact, the three subunits, τ138, τ91, and τ60, were necessary to reconstitute a strongly DNA-binding complex (Fig. 2A). In the absence of any of these three subunits, no other DNA-protein complex similar in size could be detected (data not shown). To demonstrate the presence of these three polypeptides in the B block-binding complex, rτB-tDNA3Leu complexes were incubated for 1 h at 25°C with increasing amounts of subunit-specific antibodies and analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. As shown in Fig. 2B, anti-FLAG and anti-histidine monoclonal antibodies altered the migration of the rτB-tDNA complex (Fig. 2B, compare lane 1 with lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Anti-τ91 polyclonal antibodies also interfered with complex formation (Fig. 2B, lanes 5 and 6), as observed when endogenous TFIIIC (yTFIIIC) is used in gel shift assays (11Arrebola R. Manaud N. Rozenfeld S. Marsolier M.C. Lefebvre O. Carles C. Thuriaux P. Conesa C. Sentenac A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1-9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, rτB-tDNA complex was not affected by control anti-T7 antibodies (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 2). These results indicated that τ138, τ91, and τ60 reconstituted rτB. rτB-DNA interaction was then analyzed by DNA footprinting and compared with the characteristic footprint observed with yTFIIIC over the tRNA3Leu gene (43Kassavetis G.A. Riggs D.L. Negri R. Nguyen L.H. Geiduschek E.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2551-2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 1). As expected, rτB gave a partial footprint, spanning only the 3′ half of the gene, over the B block. The protection of the B block region was similar with rτB and yTFIIIC (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 2 and 3), which confirmed the binding specificity of the rτB complex. Limited α-chymotrypsin proteolysis of rτB generated a stable protein-tDNA3Leu complex of the same increased electrophoretic mobility as the protease-resistant τB complex (8Marzouki N. Camier S. Ruet A. Moenne A. Sentenac A. Nature. 1986; 323: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) generated from the endogenous yeast TFIIIC (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 3 and 5). Therefore, when bound to tDNA, the reconstituted rτB and the τB domain of TFIIIC appeared to have the same accessibility to the protease, supporting the model of a transcription factor made of two structural modules. Together, these data demonstrate that, using full-length polypeptides, the minimum specific B block-binding domain is composed of τ138, τ91, and τ60.FIGURE 2Reconstitution of rτB. High Five cells were infected with recombinant baculoviruses encoding FLAG-τ138, τ91, and His-τ60. Protein extracts were chromatographed on a heparin column, and bound proteins were eluted using an NaCl gradient as described under “Materials and Methods.” Protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis and autoradiography.

Ligand-altered binding of PDHK2 to L2 and effects of specific ligands on PDHK2 oligomeric state were characterized by analytical ultracentrifugation. ATP, ADP, and pyruvate markedly quenched the tryptophan fluorescence of PDHK2 and gave maximum quenching/L0.5 estimates: ∼53%/3μm for ATP; ∼49%/15μm for ADP; and ∼71%/∼590 μm for pyruvate. The conversion of Trp-383 to phenylalanine completely removed ATP- and ADP-induced quenching and ≥80% of the absolute decrease in fluorescence due to pyruvate. The W383F-PDHK2 mutant retained high catalytic activity. Pyruvate, added after ADP, quenched Trp fluorescence with an L0.5 of 3.4 μm pyruvate, ≥150-fold lower concentration than needed with pyruvate alone. ADP-enhanced binding of pyruvate was maintained with W383F-PDHK2. Binding of PDHK2 dimer to L2 is enhanced when L2 are housed in oligomeric structures, including the glutathione S-transferase (GST)-L2 dimer, and further strengthened by reduction of the lipoyl groups (GST-L2red) (Hiromasa and Roche (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 33681-33693). Binding of PDHK2 to GST-L2red was modestly hindered by 200 μm level of ATP or ADP or 5.0 mm pyruvate; a marked change to nearly complete prevention of binding was observed with ATP or ADP plus pyruvate at only 100 μm levels, and these conditions caused PDHK2 dimer to associate to a tetramer. These changes should make major contributions to synergistic inhibition of PDHK2 activity by ADP and pyruvate. Ligand-induced changes that interfere with PDHK2 binding to GST-L2red may involve release of an interdomain cross arm between PDHK2 subunits in which Trp-383 plays a critical anchoring role.

Because this results in animals in the irrecoverable reduction of body carbohydrate reserves, PDC activity is tightly regulated by dedicated regulatory enzymes (1Patel M.S. Roche T.E.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozymes (PDHK1, PDHK2, PDHK3, and PDHK4) and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase isozymes (PDHP1 and PDHP2) control the fractional activity of PDC in a tissue-specific manner. Phosphorylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component by the PDHKs results in inactivation and dephosphorylation by the PDHPs results in reactivation of E1. The components required in the mammalian complex for the five-step PDC reaction are E1, the dihydrolipoyl acetyltransferase (E2), the dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (E3), and the E3-binding protein (E3BP) (1Patel M.S.

Specifically, human PDHK2 is stimulated by reduction (∼1.8-fold) and then acetylation (∼2.3-fold) of the lipoyl group of the L2 domain of E2 (12Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. J.

Reduction and then acetylation also progressively increase the affinity of PDHK2 for the L2 domain (15Hiromasa Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13,442-13,451Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Other effectors (ATP/ADP) decrease the binding of PDHK2 to E2 (15Hiromasa Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol.

Attenuation of PDHK2 activity is primarily by ADP (an indicator of low energy state) and pyruvate (an indicator of substrate sufficiency). These effectors act synergistically to inhibit PDHK activity (26Pratt M.L. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7191-7196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Bao H. Kasten S.A. Yan X. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13432-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently, we presented evidence that PDHK2 catalysis is limited by ADP dissociation and that having ADP bound favors the development of inhibition by pyruvate binding to the PDHK2·ADP intermediate (27Bao H. Kasten S.A. Yan X. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13432-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation by reductive acetylation of lipoyl groups was linked to an increase in speed in the dissociation of ADP (21Bao H. Kasten S.A. Yan X. Hiromasa Y. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13,442-13,451Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The capacity to characterize the E2-enhanced physiological PDHK2 reaction by kinetic studies is limited by the nonequilibrium nature of the catalytic steps. The first substrate (ATP) dissociates slower than kcat (27Bao H. Kasten S.A. Yan X. Roche T.E. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13432-13441Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The second substrate, E1, is delivered within the confines of complex, in part, by nondissociative mechanisms (2Roche T.E. Baker J. Yan X. Hiromasa Y. Gong X. Peng T. Dong J. Turkan A. Kasten S.A.

Even as a highly phosphorylated product phosphorylated-E1 is not a significant inhibitor of kinase activity (28Pratt M.L. Roche T.E. Dyer D.W. Cate R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1979; 91: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It seems likely that post dissociation conformational changes alter E1 at each step. To gain insights into the linkage between regulatory sites and to begin to relate major structural differences observed in crystal structures with ligands bound, biophysical studies are needed to analyze the effects of ligand binding on intersite communication, PDHK2 structure, and protein interactions. The PDHKs and branched chain dehydrogenase kinase are serine kinases unrelated to the major class of cytoplasmic Ser/Thr/Tyr kinases (2Roche T.E. Baker J. Yan X. Hiromasa Y. Gong X. Peng T. Dong J.

PDHK2 is a two-domain dimer formed by association of its C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain contains the ATP/ADP binding site and is a member of the GHKL superfamily (31Bowker-Kinley M.

The Nov3r binding site is the same site at which the lipoyl group binds in PDHK3·L2 domain complex (37Kato M. Chuang J.L. Tso S.-C. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A cross arm between subunits of PDHK2 dimer (35Knoechel T.R. Tucker A.D. Robinson C.M. Phillips C. Taylor W. Bungay P.J. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. Brown D.G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was shown to participate in binding the L2 domain in PDHK3·L2 complex (37Kato M. Chuang J.L. Tso S.-C. Wynn R.M. Chuang D.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1763-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A key anchoring role at the end of the cross arm involves insertion of Trp-383 into the other subunit (details under “Discussion”). Here, we find that the binding interactions of ATP, ADP, or pyruvate (or the pyruvate analog dichloroacetate (DCA)) have pronounced effects in quenching tryptophan fluorescence with PDHK2. We establish by mutation that Trp-383, which is far removed from ATP/ADP binding site, is the specific tryptophan residue undergoing marked fluorescence quenching by ATP and ADP as well as the majority of quenching by pyruvate. Related effects of ligands in hindering binding of PDHK2 to the L2 domain are described. We consider whether the Trp-383-anchored cross arm structure of PDHK2, which binds the L2 domain, may be dislodged by ligand-induced changes that cause fluorescence quenching and greatly weaken binding to L2. We also demonstrate that the binding of pyruvate and ADP or ATP alters the oligomeric state of PDHK2. These studies provide new insights into the mechanistic bases for the synergistic action of ADP plus pyruvate in down-regulating PDHK2 activity (27Bao H. Kasten S.A. Yan X. Roche T.E.

The modified expression cDNA for preparation of PDHK2 in which Trp-383 is substituted by a phenylalanine was developed by a two-step PCR procedure in which primers flanking the cDNA (routinely used for sequencing PDHK2-cDNA) were paired with matched primers introducing the mutation. Residue numbering for PDHK2 and PDHK3 (under “Discussion”) are based on the sequences of the mature proteins (see supplemental data Ref. 35Knoechel T.R. Tucker A.D. Robinson C.M. Phillips C. Taylor W. Bungay P.J. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. Brown D.G. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These initial PCR products were purified and then used as primers in the second round to produce a double-stranded DNA containing the mutated cDNA (with a His tag and PreScission protease site encoded to be expressed at the N terminus). The cDNA was excised by XbaI and HindIII restriction enzymes and inserted into PET28a (Novagen) expression plasmid. The sequence of the cDNA expressing this PDHK2 mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Expression and purification of W383F-PDHK2 were performed as described for native PDHK2 (12Baker J.C. Yan X. Peng T. Kasten S.A. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15773-15781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Quenching—Steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.) at 20 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 2.0 mm MgCl2 (buffer A). The concentration of PDHK2 in these (and AUC studies below) was based on the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 92,600 m-1 cm-1 (15Hiromasa Y. Roche T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33681-33693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Experimental error (i.e. precision of measurements) was estimated to be ±3% (so a concentration of 0.105 μm is being reported to nearest 0.005 μm). Initial fluorescence measurements (F0) for a given concentration were within ±1.5% of the average value (n = 12) at 0.105 μm and 1.53 μm PDHK2. In the case of W383F-PDHK2, protein concentration was based on BCA protein assay, performed as previously described (38Liu S. Baker J.C. Andrews P.C. Roche T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 926-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), using native PDHK2 as a standard. Excitation was at 290 nm (slit routinely 5 nm but 2.5 nm in some studies) and fluorescence spectra were recorded from 320 to 420 nm (slit usually 10 nm but 5 nm in some studies). Most studies were conducted using a standard quartz (1 × 1 cm) cuvette and a 2.0-ml initial volume with varied ligand added in 2- to 10-μl increments. Some studies with more concentrated PDHK2 were conducted with a 0.5-× 0.5-cm quartz cuvette. In the analysis of the fluorescence changes due to these titrations, the concentration of PDHK2 was continuously corrected for the slight dilution due to the addition of the concentrated ligand. Most studies were conducted with PDHK2 in the range of 0.10-1.6μm with the majority of the data shown being from studies in the range of 0.1-0.35μm. Although full 320-420 nm scans were taken, the change in fluorescence at 350 nm was used to assess fluorescence quenching. When a peak center is reported, it is for the upper third of a peak. Our analysis assumed, at least initially, that the fraction of bound ligand (Y) is equal to the ratio of the fluorescence quenching (Q = F0 - Fq) to maximum quenching (Qmax = F0 - Fqmax), where F0, Fq, and Fqmax are fluorescence at 350 nm measured in the absence of added ligand, the quenched fluorescence in the presence of ligand, and the projected maximum fluorescence quenching at a saturating level of ligand, respectively. Therefore, Y = Q/Qmax or Y = %Q/%Qmax, where %Q = 100%(F0 - Fq)/F0 and %Qmax = 100%(F0 - Fqmax/F0); Lf is the free concentration of varied ligand. The concentration that gave a half-maximal effect, L0.5 = (Lf)(1 - Y)/Y = (Lf)(%Qmax - %Q)/(%Q) or %Q = %Qmax·Lf/(L0.5 + Lf). %Qmax at saturating ligand was initially estimated by extrapolation using a double reciprocal plot and then using this first approximation of Qmax, free ligand concentrations (Lf) were calculated, correcting the added concentration for bound ligand assuming that binding was at two equivalent sites in the PDHK2 dimer (Lf = Lt - 2YEt). Generally, at the lower concentrations of PDHK2 used in most studies, this involved very small corrections. The parameters derived from those analyses at low PDHK2 concentrations, for which these corrections were very small, were compared with parameters obtained at higher concentrations of kinase for which the corrections of free ligand were substantial, particularly at the lower concentrations of tight binding ligand. The finding, that estimates of L0.5 values were equal within experimental error over this range of PDHK2 concentrations, was interpreted as supporting the assumption of two equivalent binding sites per PDHK2 dimer. The corrected data were fit by hyperbolic curve (%Q versus free) using Sigma Plot 8.02 software and by a double reciprocal plot (1/%Q versus 1/free ligand, a Klotz plot under the assumption that binding is proportional to Q/Qmax) using Origin 7.0 software (linear least squares). The concentrations of ATP and ADP were evaluated based on their absorbance (ϵ259 nm = 1.54 × 104 m-1·cm-1). Titrations of ATP and ADP gave hyperbolic changes in fluorescence quenching and equivalent L0.5 at different concentrations of PDHK2. The L0.5 values are then considered to provide apparent equilibrium binding constants. However, we know these constants reflect multiple equilibria in which specific binding of K+ and phosphate have significant effects. The marked and involved influence of these ions on ligand binding/fluorescence quenching will be described in a subsequent study. 3Y. Hiromasa and T. E. Roche, manuscript in preparation. With 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, at 25 °C; 83.3 mm K+), these ions are present at near saturating levels. In general, quenching studies that included pyruvate or DCA, whether added alone or in combination with ATP or ADP, yielded nonhyperbolic profiles for the decrease in fluorescence with increasing concentration of the varied ligand. In those cases, Qmax values were estimated from a double reciprocal plot using the higher concentrations and the data plotted in Hill plots (log(Y/1 - Y) versus log(Lf)) or plots of log(Y) versus log(Lf) with the latter made and analyzed by the Sigma Plot program. A Hill plot yielded nH from the slope estimated in the range log(Y/1 - Y) usually between -0.5 and +0.5 (-0.5 and +1.0 when nH < 1). L0.5 was estimated from log(Lf) when log(Y/(1 - Y)) = 0 in the Hill plot. In the Sigma Plot analyses of log(Y) versus log(Lf) plots, the maximum (Y′max =∼1) and minimum (Y ′min = ∼0) were independently re-evaluated in fitting the data and L0.5 obtained when log(Y ′) = 0.5 where Y ′ is half way between the revised minimum and maximum; nH was then estimated from the slope of the Hill plot created by the Sigma plot program using those values. For simplicity, the above analyses invoke the limiting assumptions of binding at two sites with the change in fluorescence quenching being proportional to binding of the varied ligand. However, that cannot be meaningfully assessed in the present work. Again, complex equilibria are involved in which binding of K+ and phosphate occurs by a variety of pathways,3 particularly when there is binding of pyruvate/DCA along with ATP or ADP. Our studies provide condition-dependent L0.5 values that demonstrate large changes in the concentration dependence that result from major changes in binding affinities due to the binding of a second ligand. The effects of all these ligands on the fluorescence of N-acetyltryptophanamide (NATA) were analyzed to evaluate effects due to chemical quenching and self-absorption (see data under Supplemental Data, Fig. 1S) (40Eftink M.R.

https://openalex.org/W1988523786,"DnaA is the initiator protein for chromosomal replication in bacteria; its activity plays a central role in the timing of the primary initiations within the Escherichia coli cell cycle. A controlled, reversible conversion between the active ATP-DnaA and the inactive ADP forms modulates this activity. In a DNA-dependent manner, bound ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP. Acidic phospholipids with unsaturated fatty acids are capable of reactivating ADP-DnaA by promoting the release of the tightly bound ADP. The nucleotide dissociation kinetics, measured in the present study with the fluorescent derivative 3′-O-(N-methylantraniloyl)-5′-adenosine triphosphate, was dependent on the density of DnaA on the membrane in a cooperative manner: it increased 5-fold with decreased protein density. At all surface densities the nucleotide was completely released, presumably due to protein exchange on the membrane. Distinct temperature dependences and the effect of the crowding agent Ficoll suggest that two functional states of DnaA exist at high and low membrane occupancy, ascribed to local macromolecular crowding on the membrane surface. These novel phenomena are thought to play a major role in the mechanism regulating the initiation of chromosomal replication in bacteria.

These novel phenomena are thought to play a major role in the mechanism regulating the initiation of chromosomal replication in bacteria. Initiation of DNA replication is the central event in the bacterial cell cycle (1Messer W. Weigel C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.2nd Ed. ASM Press, Herndon, VA1996: 1579-1601Google Scholar). To create identical daughter cells, the initiation should occur only once per cycle, synchronously at all origins of replication and at the right time (2Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These requirements imply the existence of one or more precise regulatory systems that can adjust to a variety of physiological conditions (3Helmstetter C.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium.2nd Ed. ASM Press, Herndon, VA1996: 1627-1639Google Scholar). DnaA is the key protein in the initiation of replication in all known eubacteria species and has analogs in eukaryotes. Its overall activity cycle is driven by ATP binding and hydrolysis that “acts as a molecular switch that couples key events during initiation of replication” (4Lee D.G. Bell S.P. Cur. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli DnaA binds to the five DnaA-boxes on oriC and promotes the replication complex assembly (5Messer W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2002; 26: 355-374PubMed Google Scholar). Naturally, this first event in the multistep initiation process is the target for regulation: the initiating activity of DnaA depends on the type of the bound nucleotide, and only the ATP-DnaA form is functional (6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Immediately after the initiation, DnaA has to be inactivated to prevent untimely initiations on the newly replicated oriCs. Accordingly, the RIDA (replication inactivation of DnaA) mechanism induces ATPase activity of DnaA by converting it into the inactive ADP form (7Katayama T. Kubota T. Kurokawa T. Crooke E. Sekimizu K. Cell. 1998; 94: 61-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Katayama T. Sekimizu K.

Chem. 2005; 280: 6528-6536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The next phase of the DnaA activity cycle is reactivation of ADP-DnaA to its ATP form. The spontaneous exchange of ADP to ATP is a very slow process even at a high ATP/ADP ratio, as under physiological conditions (6Sekimizu K. Bramhill D. Kornberg A. Cell. 1987; 50: 259-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This is perhaps the reason for the relatively low (∼20%) average level of ATP-DnaA found in growing cells, which is elevated at the verge of initiation time (10Kurokawa K. Nishida S. Emoto A. Sekimizu K. Katayama T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6642-6652Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Acidic phospholipids in a fluid membrane were shown to be responsible for the acceleration of the nucleotide exchange in vitro (11Sekimizu K. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7131-7135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are involved in the DnaA-dependent initiation in vivo (12Xia W. Dowhan W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 783-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Further investigations shed light on the mode of DnaA-membrane interaction (13Kitchen J. Li Z. Crooke E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Castuma C.E. Crooke E. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24665-24668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and pointed to a specific region of the protein responsible for this interaction (15Garner J. Crooke E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3477-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Garner J. Durrer P. Kitchen J. Brunner J. Crooke E. J. Biol.

Crooke E. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2005; 8: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). How could DnaA initiating activity be dependent on the progress of the cell cycle? At least two general possibilities may be considered. First, ATP-DnaA is rapidly and continuously regenerated by the membrane, but some factors restrain its initiation activity until the proper time in the cell cycle. Second, ADP-ATP exchange does not occur continuously and is triggered at the right moment. The first possibility may be realized by (i) regulation of the DnaA concentration in the cell at the transcriptional level, (ii) modulation of the level of the free protein, e.g. through titration by multiple DnaA boxes on the chromosome (titration model (21Hansen F.G. Christensen B.B. Atlung T. Res. Microbiol. 1991; 142: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar)). These two mechanisms are considered as important for normal replication control but not crucial for exact timing (2Boye E. Lobner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 479-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), particularly because the continuous expression of DnaA from a plasmid had no effect on the replication control (22Lobner-Olesen A. Skarstad K. Hansen F.G. von Meyenburg K. Boye E. Cell. 1989; 57: 881-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Recently, the deletion of the datA site (DnaA binding) was shown not to affect the right timing of the initiation (23Morigen M.F. Skarstad K. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 3913-3920Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), thus strongly rejecting the titration model. The membrane-regulated triggering may include (i) oscillation in the level of acidic phospholipids during the cell cycle and (ii) formation of membrane domains with appropriate compositions at the right time. Data on changes in the level of individual phospholipids during the cell cycle are controversial (24Carty C.E. Ingram L.O. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 472-478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mozharov A.D. Fishov I.L. Shchipakin V.N. Evtodienko Yu V. FEBS Lett. 1985; 186: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Such changes could provide the activation signal in view of the stimulation of nucleotide dissociation from DnaA by raising the fraction of acidic phospholipids in mixed liposomes (13Kitchen J. Li Z. Crooke E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, there is an indication that clustering, rather than the concentration of acidic phospholipids, in such a membrane is essential for nucleotide dissociation (26Mizushima T. Ishikawa Y. Obana E. Hase M. Kubota T. Katayama T. Kunitake T. Watanabe E. Sekimizu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3633-3638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the E. coli membrane, both structural and compositional heterogeneity were revealed (27Fishov I. Woldringh C.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1166-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28Vanounou S. Pines D. Pines E. Parola A.H. Fishov I. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; l76: 1-11Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Domains containing cardiolipin were visualized at the cell poles (29Mileykovskaya E. Dowhan W. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1172-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), consistent with an enrichment of cardiolipin in minicells (30Koppelman C.M. den Blaauwen T. Duursma M.C. Heeren R.M. Nanninga N. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6144-6147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). It was shown that acidic and neutral phospholipids are sequestered into separate pre-existing domains in the bacterial membrane (31Vanounou S. Parola A.H. Fishov I. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 1067-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our working hypothesis is that such domains may provide the binding sites for integral and peripheral (amphitropic) membrane proteins and serve as spatially and temporally localized signal (32Norris V. Fishov I. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The dynamics of such domains during the cell cycle may trigger the accessibility of the activating acidic phospholipids to DnaA. Alternatively, the membrane environment is suitable for regenerating ATP-DnaA throughout the cell cycle, but such regeneration does not occur until a specific time in the cell cycle, because an unidentified factor may restrain the regeneration process until that time. The results obtained in this work in vitro suggest that in growing bacteria both alternatives may be combined as interplay between the phospholipid domain size and protein concentration, wherein the protein surface density (crowding) plays the role of the restraining factor. In this work we examined how the kinetics of membrane-induced nucleotide dissociation from DnaA depends on the phospholipid/protein ratio (PL/Pr). 3The abbreviations used are: PL/Pr, ratio of phospholipids to protein; DPH-PC, 1-palmitoyl-2-(3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propanoyl)phosphatidylcholine; laurdan, 6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminenaphthalene; MANT-ATP, 2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; SOPC, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; SOPG, 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)]. The nucleotide binding kinetics, followed by the fluorescent derivative, 3′-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-adenosine 5′-triphosphate (MANT-ATP), appeared to be strongly sensitive to the protein density on the membrane. We will discuss this finding in relation to the timing of the initiation of DNA replication in the bacterial cell cycle. Materials—1-Stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SOPC) and 1-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (SOPG) were from Avanti Polar Lipids; MANT-ATP and 1-palmitoyl-2-(3-(diphenylhexatrienyl)propanoyl)-phosphatidylcholine (DPH-PC) were from Molecular Probes; and Ni-NTA was from Qiagen. Purification of His10-DnaA—Recombinant polyhistidine-tagged DnaA was expressed in E. coli strain BLR(DE3)pLysS from the plasmid pZL411, kindly provided by Prof. Elliott Crooke (Georgetown University, Washington, D. C.). The purification procedure was essentially as described (33Li Z. Crooke E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. A protease inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, was added prior to lysate preparation. An Ni-NTA column (3 ml of the resin volume) was used instead of a batch preparation to obtain larger amounts of protein. Nonspecifically bound proteins were washed with 40 mm imidazole and His10-DnaA was eluted with 0.8 m imidazole. Protein concentrations were measured by a dye-binding assay (34Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE following Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The eluted protein was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Before each experiment, aggregated proteins were removed from the soluble fraction by centrifugation (3 × 105 g, 10 min). Throughout this report, the tagged protein is designated as DnaA for simplicity. Binding of MANT-ATP to DnaA—All experiments were carried out in 600 μl of Buffer AC (50 mm PIPES·KOH (pH 7), 30 mm KCl, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 20% (w/v) sucrose, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.2 m ammonium sulfate at 30 °C. Fluorescence intensity was measured on a LS55 fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at fixed wavelengths λex = 352 nm and λem = 442 nm with both slits at 10 nm width. Vertical and horizontal polarizers were introduced for excitation and emission, respectively, to reduce the contribution of scattered light in the presence of liposomes without affecting the changes in fluorescence intensity of MANT-ATP upon binding to DnaA. Titration of MANT-ATP (0.1 μm) with DnaA (0.059-1.89 μm) was used to convert fluorescence changes into molar values by determining the relative fluorescence intensity increase per molecule of MANT-ATP bound to the protein (Q), Q=(Fi-Fbackground)·Vi(F0-Fbackground)·V0(Eq. 1) where Fi and F0 are the fluorescence intensities of MANT-ATP in the presence and absence of DnaA, respectively, Fbackground is the fluorescence intensity of buffer and DnaA, Vi is the current volume, and V0 is the initial volume of the sample. Changes in total MANT-ATP concentration because of dilution were neglected, because the maximal volume changes were <4%. To determine the affinity and stoichiometry of MANT-ATP binding to DnaA, the measurement of fluorescence intensity was carried out at various concentrations of MANT-ATP (0.013-1.220 μm) in the absence and the presence of DnaA (0.8 μm). The calculations of the concentration of free ligand ([MANT-ATP]free) and the concentration bound to DnaA ([MANT-ATP]bound) were as follows MANT-ATPbound=MANT-ATPtotalFi-F0+FbackgroundF0·Q-1(Eq. 2) MANT-ATPfree=MANT-ATPtotal-MANT-ATPbound(Eq. 3) where [MANT-ATP]total is the concentration of added MANT-ATP. The changes in total DnaA concentration were neglected, because the maximal volume changes were <3%. The data were analyzed using a single-site binding isotherm in Equation 4. MANT-ATPbound=MANT-ATPboundmaxMANT-ATPfreeKD+MANT-ATPfree(Eq. 4) The fluorescence method was validated by parallel determination of the affinity and stoichiometry of ATP binding to DnaA by the filter retention radioactive technique using [α-32P]ATP (33Li Z. Crooke E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Preparation of Liposomes—Briefly, the powder of phospholipids was dissolved in chloroform, and subsequently dried under a stream of nitrogen gas and resuspended in Buffer AC. Large unilamellar vesicles were prepared with Avanti Mini Extruder by 11 passes through a Nucleopore polycarbonate membrane with a pore diameter of 100 nm at room temperature. Phospholipid concentrations were determined by the phosphomolybdate colorimetric assay (36Ames B.V. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of the liposomes was estimated by dynamic light scattering on ALV/GCS-3 with the ALV/LSE-5003 correlator. The diameter of SOPG and SOPC liposomes in Buffer AC at 20 °C was 124 and 140 nm, respectively (refractive index and viscosity were taken from a reference table for 20% sucrose solution (63Lide D.R. Handbook of Chemistry and Physics. CRC Press LLC, FL1990: D-264Google Scholar). Co-sedimentation of DnaA with Liposomes—The binding of DnaA to phospholipids was examined by co-sedimentation with liposomes of various compositions (37Mileykovskaya E. Fishov I. Fu X. Corbin B.D. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22193-22198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To this end, DnaA was preincubated with 1 mm ATP on ice for an hour and then diluted 10-fold in Buffer AC and ultracentrifuged at 300,000 × g (Sorvall Discovery M-120 centrifuge with a S120-AT2 rotor) for 10 min at 25 °C. Protein concentration in the supernatant was determined by the Bradford assay. Afterward, DnaA (0.15-1.4 μm) was incubated for 10 min with freshly prepared SOPG or SOPC liposomes (5-500 μm phospholipids) in 200 μl of Buffer AC in the presence of 1 mm ATP at room temperature. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, at 25 °C (Sorvall M-120 with a S100-AT3 rotor), and 160 μl of supernatant was carefully removed. The pellet was resuspended in the rest, 40 μl. The protein in each fraction was visualized by SDS-PAGE following Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Stained gels were scanned, and the protein bands were quantified using the National Institutes of Health Image program. The relative amount of sedimented DnaA (D) was calculated as follows, D=2P-S4S+2P(Eq. 5) where P is the amount of protein (arbitrary integral band intensity) found in 20 μl of the pellet fraction loaded on the gel, and S is the amount of protein found in 40 μl of the supernatant fraction loaded on the gel. The amount of DnaA sedimented in the absence of liposomes was used to obtain the correct values of the co-precipitated protein. For determining the amount of the sedimented phospholipids, liposomes were prepared with incorporated DPH-PC (DPH-PC:SOPG = 1:100). After centrifugation with varying concentrations of protein as described above, the fluorescence signal of DPH-PC (excitation 350 nm, emission 430 nm) was measured in the pellet, and the supernatant fractions were dissolved in 700 μl of 0.1% SDS. A relative amount of sedimented phospholipids was calculated similar to Equation 5 ([fluorescence of pellet]/[total fluorescence]). Calculation of Membrane Occupancy—The membrane occupancy (ϕ) is defined here as the ratio of the number of phospholipids in the bilayer “occupied” by bound protein molecules to the total phospholipids in the membrane. The results of co-sedimentation experiments were fitted with a binding isotherm, PrB=PrT·PLTKD+PLT(Eq. 6) where PLT is the total concentration of the phospholipids, and PrT and PrB are the total and bound DnaA concentrations, respectively, and KD is the apparent dissociation constant. At infinitesimal PLT, KD/PrT approximates PLmin, the minimal amount of phospholipids needed to bind one molecule of DnaA. According to the above definition, Equation 7 results. ϕ=PLmin·PrBPLT(Eq. 7) After substitution of PrB in Equation 7, the membrane occupancy may be calculated using Equation 8. ϕ=PLmin·PrTPLmin·PrT+PLT(Eq. 8) Measurement of Membrane Dynamics—Changes in membrane dynamics induced by the binding of DnaA were examined through alteration of the fluorescence emission spectra of laurdan and pyrene. SOPG liposomes (30 μm) were labeled with 0.5 μm pyrene or 0.3 μm laurdan added from a stock solution in ethanol to Buffer AC with 1 mm ATP. The emission spectra of pyrene were recorded at an excitation wavelength of 337 nm with 3 nm slits at increasing concentrations of ATP-DnaA (0.01-1.5 μm) (prepared as described above) at 30 °C. The excimer-to-monomer ratio was calculated from the intensities of the emission peaks at 470 and 374 nm. Laurdan was excited at 354 nm, and the ratio of the emission intensities at 490 and 440 nm was calculated. All fluorescence intensity values were corrected for the background of unlabeled liposomes and protein. Fluorescent Analog MANT-ATP Is Suitable to Assess Nucleotide-DnaA Binding Kinetics—The binding of the fluorescent analog of ATP, MANT-ATP, to purified His10-DnaA was compared with that of ATP. MANT-ATP is an environmentally sensitive fluorophor, which exhibits increased fluorescence intensity upon binding to proteins (38Galletto R. Rajendran S. Bujalowski W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12959-12969Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The addition of DnaA to MANT-ATP caused a gradual increase in fluorescence intensity, indicative of the hydrophobic environment of the nucleotide-binding site (Fig. 1). Upon the addition of an excessive amount of ATP, the fluorescence intensity was reduced to its initial level, apparently due to the competitive exchange of MANT-ATP for ATP at the binding site on DnaA (Fig. 1). The observed increase and decrease in fluorescence reflect the binding and dissociation kinetics of the fluorescent nucleotide and thus obey first-order kinetics (e.g. see Fig. 4). The corresponding fit allows estimation of the rate constant and the amplitude of changes.FIGURE 4Kinetics of MANT-ATP dissociation from MANT-ATP·DnaA complex induced by an excess of ATP (1 mm)(▴), SOPC (•), or SOPG (□) liposomes (1 mm)or SOPG together with ATP (▪). DnaA (0.8 μm) was preincubated with MANT-ATP (0.045 μm) for an hour on ice, and the fluorescence intensity was measured at 30 °C following the addition of liposomes or ATP. The dissociation kinetics was fitted with a first-order exponential decay function. These are representative results out of numerous repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To obtain both the dissociation constant and the binding stoichiometry, we first attempted to estimate the relative fluorescent intensity increase for one molecule of MANT-ATP bound to DnaA. A binding experiment fitted with a corresponding saturation function (Fig. 2A) showed that the fluorescence intensity of MANT-ATP bound to DnaA increases 1.4-fold. Using this parameter and Equation 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”), the titration of DnaA with MANT-ATP (Fig. 2B) resulted in a KD value of 98 ± 13 nm and a MANT-ATP-to-DnaA ratio of 0.13 ± 0.01. The radioactive filter-retention technique (Fig. 2C) enabled us to make a comparison with the native non-fluorescent ligand, which resulted in KD = 20 ± 4 nm and an ATP-to-DnaA ratio of 0.36 ± 0.01 at 30 °C, and 25 ± 3 nm and 0.27 ± 0.01, respectively, at 4 °C. These latter results are very close to the data found in the literature (33Li Z. Crooke E. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 17: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a competition experiment was performed, in which MANT-ATP fluorescence intensity changes were measured with a constant amount of MANT-ATP and with varying concentrations of ATP (Fig. 2D). The exact competition analysis is hampered, because the DnaA concentration was close to that of ATP or MANT-ATP. It follows that 0.3 μm ATP was needed to replace one half of bound MANT-ATP on DnaA (Fig. 2D), which is about three times less than the total concentration of MANT-ATP. Combining this result with the KD values obtained from fluorescent and radioactive experiments (a difference of ∼5-fold), we arrived at an estimation that ATP binds to DnaA ∼4-fold better than MANT-ATP. This implies that the same order of magnitude of affinity exists for both the native and fluorescent analog of ATP, rendering the latter suitable for the following studies. The advantage of using the fluorescent analog is that it enables a continuous follow up of binding kinetics. Binding Characteristics of DnaA to the Phospholipid Membrane Determined by Co-precipitation of the Protein with Liposomes and by Changes in Membrane Dynamics—To make our results comparable and consistent with the previous data, we used the same type of phospholipids as employed in the thorough work from Crooke's laboratory (13Kitchen J. Li Z. Crooke E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Binding of DnaA to liposomes composed of acidic phospholipid SOPG was measured by co-precipitation of the protein with the liposomes by centrifugation as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 3A). The technique is based on published methods (37Mileykovskaya E. Fishov I. Fu X. Corbin B.D. Margolin W. Dowhan W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22193-22198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 39Arnold R.S. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6149-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and relies on the fact that a liposome with a bound protein has a higher density and hence may be precipitated. Indeed, Fig. 3B shows that in addition to more than a half of liposomes that sediment in the absence of protein (as estimated by DPH-PC fluorescence, see “Experimental Procedures”), the relative amount of phospholipids found in the pellet fraction rises with increased protein concentrations, at a constant concentration of SOPG. Thus, after incubation of DnaA with different concentrations of phospholipids and subsequent centrifugation, the protein found in the pellet is considered as bound to liposomes. The fractions of DnaA in the pellet and the supernatant were quantified (see “Experimental Procedures,” Equation 5), and the data were fitted with a binding isotherm (Fig. 3, A and C, and Equation 6) resulting in KD(SOPG) = 43.4 ± 15 μm. No binding was observed with liposomes composed of zwitterionic SOPC (Fig. 3C). A linear transformation of the data from Fig. 3C resulted in an estimated minimal SOPG amount required for binding one molecule of DnaA (Fig. 3C, inset). When the SOPG concentration is infinitesimal, the ratio of SOPG/DnaA approaches 120. In other words, a minimum of 120 SOPG molecules is required to bind a single molecule of DnaA. From this ratio the minimal membrane surface area needed to bind one molecule of the protein can be estimated based on the following assumptions: (i) only half of the phospholipids of the bilayer, which is the outer leaflet, are accessible to DnaA, and (ii) the area of one SOPG on the membrane surface is ∼70 Å2 (40Thomas D.D. Caslsen W.F. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5746-5750Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, the minimal binding area is ∼4200 Å2. From the crystallographic data of a truncated homologue from a thermophilic bacterium (41Erzberger J.P. Pirruccello M.M. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4763-4773Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), the hypothetical area of DnaA projected on the membrane surface can be roughly calculated as 2500 Å2. Apparently, DnaA binding to the membrane requires a surface area ∼2-fold higher than its packed solid-state structure. This could mean that the maximal density of DnaA on the membrane is limited merely by its dynamic volume. DnaA binding induced changes at the polar surface of the membrane as well as in its hydrophobic core, which were evaluated by changes in the fluorescence spectra of laurdan and pyrene, respectively. Pyrene forms excited-state dimers (excimers) with emission at 470 nm. The ratio of excimer (470 nm) to monomer (374 nm) emission increases with increasing rates of diffusion (42Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy.2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 276-277Google Scholar). Because pyrene is highly hydrophobic, it reports on changes in the hydrophobic membrane core. The relatively polar nature of laurdan enables one to obtain information about changes at the polar membrane surface. Owing to its dipolar relaxation, the emission spectrum of laurdan is sensitive to the polarity and the lamellar phase domains of the bilayer (28Vanounou S. Pines D. Pines E. Parola A.H. Fishov I. Photochem. Photobiol. 2002; l76: 1-11Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The ratio of emission intensities at 490 nm and 440 nm was used as a measure of the changes in membrane dynamics. Both fluorophores showed a gradual increase in membrane “microviscosity” as SOPG-liposomes were titrated by DnaA (Fig. 3D), along with the binding of the protein to the membrane (Fig. 3C). The apparent KD (SOPG/DnaA) values calculated from the laurdan and pyrene"

In mammals, trophoblast cells in the placenta are essential for the growth and survival of the embryo. Trophoblast stem (TS) 3The abbreviations used are: TS, trophoblast stem; FGF4, fibroblast growth factor 4; SOCS3, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; WT, wild-type; GFP, green florescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; TGC, trophoblast giant cell. cells have been established from either blastocysts or early postimplantation trophoblasts in the presence of fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) (1Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). These cell lines differentiated into trophoblast subtypes in vitro and have the potential to contribute to the placenta in chimeras in vivo. However, it remains to be clarified whether the in vivo differentiated trophoblasts from TS cells are functional. SOCS3 is an essential negative regulator of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor signaling in trophoblast differentiation (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of SOCS3 demonstrates embryonic lethality with placental defect (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C.

Alexander W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9324-9329Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In the SOCS3-deficient placenta, an excess status of trophoblast giant cell differentiation is observed. The embryonic lethality in SOCS3–/– embryos is rescued by the complementation of wild-type tetraploid embryos, thus demonstrating an essential role of SOCS3 in placental development and a non-essential role in embryo development (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). To explore the potential of TS cells in rescuing the placental defect in SOCS3-deficient mice, we attempted to prepare a chimera by using SOCS3–/– embryo and WT TS cells. Mice—The generation of SOCS3-disrupted mice was as described in a previous study (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Using tail biopsies, genotyping was performed by PCR as described. Mutant phenotypes were analyzed in a mixed 129/Sve, C57Bl/6 background. TS Cell Injections—TS cell lines were derived from B5/enhanced green florescent protein (EGFP) transgenic mice (4Hadjantonakis A.K. Gertsenstein M. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Nagy A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) (kindly supplied by Dr. J. Rossant) that ubiquitously express EGFP. These cells had already been cultured for more than 30 passages and showed a typical colony (Fig. 1, left). TS cells were maintained in the presence of FGF4 and conditioned medium from mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (1Tanaka S. Kunath T. Hadjantonakis A.K. Nagy A. Rossant J. Science. 1998; 282: 2072-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). On E2.5, morula stage embryos were collected from SOCS3 heterozygous intercrosses, the zonae were removed, and embryos were aggregated with 10–15 TS cells in drop culture. After overnight culture, the developed blastocysts were transferred to the uteri of pseudopregnant females. In the injection method, 10–15 TS cells were injected into the blastocysts from the SOCS3 heterozygous intercrosses. Blastocysts in which only the injection medium were used as the control. After injection, 8–10 blastocysts per pseudopregnant female were transferred into the uteri. Tetraploid rescue experiments were performed as described previously (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Histological Analysis—Freshly isolated placenta were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (4Hadjantonakis A.K. Gertsenstein M. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Nagy A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar μm). Sections were analyzed by hematoxylin/eosin staining. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemical staining of cells was performed according to standard protocols as described previously (5Dominici M. Pritchard C. Garlits J.E. Hofmann T.J. Persons D.A. Horwitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11761-11766Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, GFP expression in sections of the placenta was identified by overnight incubation of formalin-fixed, decalcified, paraffin-embedded sections at 4 °C with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (1:300) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The primary antibody was visualized with a biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1-h incubation, room temperature, dilution of 1:200), and peroxidase-conjugated avidin (ABC kit, Vector Laboratories) by using NovaRED (Vector Laboratories) as the substrate; counterstaining was performed with Harris hematoxylin (Surgipath Medical Industries, Richmond, IL). To produce a chimera with SOCS3–/– embryos and TS cells, we first attempted an aggregation method (6Nagy A. Gocza E. Diaz E.M. Prideaux V.R. Ivanyi E. Markkula M. Rossant J. Development (Camb.). 1990; 110: 815-821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To visualize and monitor the TS cells, we used GFP-positive TS cells. However, the ability of the TS cells to integrate into the blastocysts was poor and the ratio of chimerism in the placenta was low (less than 5%; data not shown). We were not able to detect any SOCS3–/– embryos at term among more than 100 embryos after aggregation. Next, we attempted the injection method. Ten to fifteen TS cells were injected into blastocysts from heterozygous intercrosses (Fig. 1, right). Generally, SOCS3–/– embryos die between E11.5–13.5 and after E15.5; no SOCS3–/– embryos survived (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). We then recovered embryos at term (E18.5–19.5) and analyzed their genotypes. In the control, there were no SOCS3–/– embryos on E18.5. In contrast, 5 SOCS3–/– embryos were detected, among TS-cell injected embryos (p < 0.001, compared with the control), although, one embryo was dead at term (Table 1). The average embryo weight of SOCS3+/+, SOCS3+/–, and SOCS3–/– was 1.57 ± 0.22 g, 1.59 ± 0.14 g, and 1.15 ± 0.17 g (mean ± S.D. of living pups), respectively. Although, the intrauterine growth of the rescued SOCS3–/– embryos was significantly impaired, four out of five pups were alive. In contrast, in tetraploid rescue experiments, the sizes of the rescued SOCS3–/– embryo were comparable with that of +/+ and +/– (data not sown) (2Takahashi Y. Carpino N. Cross J.C. Torres M. Parganas E. Ihle J.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 372-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Next, histological analysis of the placentas was performed (Fig. 2). In the SOCS3 deficient placenta, trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) occupied in the labyrinth, and there was no intact labyrinthine layer that is essential for the exchange of oxygen and nutrition (Fig. 2, right). In contrast, in the rescued SOCS3–/– placenta, intact labyrinthine layer was detected (Fig. 2, middle, arrows) despite the presence of aberrant TGCs in the labyrinth (Fig. 2, middle, asterisk). The degree of improvement in the rescued placenta was correlated to the embryo weight (data not shown). Immunohistochemistry using anti-GFP antibody demonstrated diffuse contribution of GFP-positive trophoblasts (Fig. 3A). Particularly, many GFP-positive cells were detected in the intact labyrinthine structure (Fig. 3A, panel a, arrow) and chorion (Fig. 3A, panel c, arrow) where the trophoblast stem cells reside (7Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some eutopic TGCs were also GFP-positive (Fig. 3A, panel b, arrow), suggesting that TS cells could differentiate into TGCs in intact localization. The ratio of the contribution of GFP-positive trophoblasts to the placentas was significantly correlated to the weight of SOCS3–/– embryos (r = 0.96, p < 0.05, data not shown). No GFP-positive cells were detected in the embryos (data not shown).TABLE 1Genotyping analysis of embryos at term in TS cells rescue and tetraploid rescue experimentsSOCS3 genotype+/++/--/- (e18.5)TS cells injection39595(1dead)Control (vehicle injection)47880Tetraploid rescue21368 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Immunohistochemistry for GFP in rescued placenta shows the integration of GFP+ trophoblast in the SOCS3-deficient placenta.

Although, the rescued SOCS3–/– embryos demonstrated intrauterine growth retardation, indicating partial rescue of placental function comparing with tetraploid rescue experiments, the presence of SOCS3–/– embryos at term with TS cell-injected placenta clearly indicates that the TS cells support the placental function until term as well as the histological improvement in the placental structure. It is intriguing that the integrated TS cells differentiated properly even in SOCS3–/– placenta depending on the localization in the placenta. These results imply that the aberrant differentiation in SOCS3–/– trophoblasts was a cell-autonomous effect, and its effect did not affect the programmed differentiation property. The embryonic lethality associated with many targeted mutations in mice has been shown to involve placental defects (7Rossant J. Cross J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 538-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Importantly, the associated insufficiencies in nutrient, gas, and waste exchange cause a secondary embryonic phenotype. In this case, tetraploid complementation rescues placental trophoblast defect and enables identification of the embryonic phenotypes that arise secondary to the defects in extraembryonic cells (8Nagy A. Rossant J. Nagy R. Abramow-Newerly W. Roder J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8424-8428Crossref PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar, 9Ihle J.N. Cell. 2000; 102: 131-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although, the efficiency of TS cells rescue is less than that in tetraploid rescue (5 versus 12%, Table 1), TS cells rescue experiments involving simple techniques can be used for this purpose. Whether this strategy could be used for rescuing other mutations impacting placental development is an important question and further study is required in this regard. However, based on our results, and theoretical knowledge, it is strongly speculated that trophoblast stem cells could rescue other mutations with placental defect. The potential of TS cells to rescue placental defect indicates a new possible application in the treatment of placental abnormality."

RAP blocks the binding function of LRP in vitro and in vivo; in fact, overexpression of RAP has been successfully used to transiently inactivate LRP in adult mice, leading to remnant lipoprotein accumulation (24Willnow T.E. Sheng Z. Ishibashi S. Herz J. Science. 1994; 264: 1471-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Physiologically, RAP acts as a molecular chaperone necessary for the proper secretion of several cell surface molecules (21Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Orlando R.A. Kerjaschki D. Kurihara H. Biemesderfer D. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rennke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22218-22224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Specifically, RAP has been shown to facilitate LRP folding and/or to prevent premature ligand binding in the secretory pathway (26Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 27Bu G. Rennke S. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2632-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Thus, transgenic mice engineered to lack RAP expression show a 75% decrease in functional LRP (29Willnow T.E. Armstrong S.A. Hammer R.E. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4537-4541Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). RAP is an ER-resident protein that is recycled by the KDEL receptor (30Bu G. Rennke S. Geuze H.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 65-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The half-life for its turnover is 13–18 h (26Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2269-2280Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Thus, its effects as a molecular chaperone are long lived but largely confined to the ER. van Vlijmen et al. (31van Vlijmen B.J. Rohlmann A. Page S.T. Bensadoun A. Bos I.S. van Berkel T.J. Havekes L.M. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35219-35226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) examined the effect of hepatic RAP overexpression in mice whose LDL receptor (LDLR) and/or LRP were knocked out. The RAP overexpression in mice deficient in both LDLR and LRP resulted in a defect in the conversion of chylomicrons into smaller remnant particles, a conversion associated with LPL action. In addition, there was a striking hypertriglyceridemia. This defect correlated with the appearance of an increase in the concentration of inactive LPL in plasma. The accumulation of plasma lipids was not due to inhibition of a novel liver lipoprotein receptor, since no RAP binding could be demonstrated in liver cells of mice that were LDLR and LRP-deficient. These studies suggested the existence of an extrahepatic RAP-sensitive site. High RAP expression may have affected the maturation of LPL. In this study, we endeavored to examine the possibility of a direct binding interaction between LPL and RAP. Our results show that RAP and LPL are capable of tight binding interactions both in vitro and in vivo. Compared with control adipocytes, cultured adipocytes derived from the somatovascular fraction of RAP-deficient mice secrete LPL with a lower specific activity and lower affinity for the adipocyte cell surface. These results suggest that RAP may play a role as a chaperone/escort protein of LPL. Materials—The pGEX expression plasmid, pGEX-39-kDa, containing the sequence for the rat RAP/glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was kindly provided by Dr. Joachim Herz (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). RAP Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)—RAP was expressed as a GST fusion protein in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-agarose chromatography after the method of Iodanato et al. (32Iadonato S.P. Bu G. Maksymovitch E.A. Schwartz A.L. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The GST moiety was cleaved by incubating the fusion protein with 1.9 units of thrombin/mg of protein at 37 °C for 4–6 h and quenching with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonic acid, whereupon the RAP was subjected to a second glutathione-agarose chromatography. To prepare RAP free of degradation products, the protein preparation was further purified by SDS-PAGE, and the band corresponding to the full-length RAP was excised and electroeluted with a Schleicher and Schuell Elutrap System in 192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Hecameg, pH 8.3 (Fig. 1A). Antibodies were generated in rabbits and immunoglobulins prepared by affinity chromatography using Affi-Prep 10 resin coupled to electroeluted RAP. Western blotting of tissue extracts yielded single bands (Fig. 1B). Immunoprecipitation of RAP in Tran35S-label™ (ICN)-labeled McA-RH7777 cells resulted in a single band that migrated just below the ovalbumin standard (Fig. 1C). The band was competed out by the addition of recombinant RAP protein. A sandwich ELISA was designed as described previously (33Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The standard curve was linear in the range from 0.05 to 6 ng with an r2 of 0.99. At a level of 1 ng, the net A490 was 0.170. Mouse LPL ELISA—The mouse LPL cDNA (mL5 in pGEM-2) was obtained from Dr. M. Schotz (UCLA). The 1.43-kb insert was excised with EcoRI and cloned into pBluescript II KS+ to give pB-LPL. pB-LPL was then cut with EcoRV and PstI and subcloned into pQE-32 between the PstI and SmaI sites for overexpression as a His6 fusion protein in E. coli. The His6-LPL recombinant protein was purified first by an Ni2+ chelate affinity step followed by preparative SDS-PAGE. Bands corresponding to the fusion protein were excised and electroeluted. This protein was used for immunization of a goat and construction of an affinity column consisting of LPL-His6 protein coupled to Affi-Prep resin (Bio-Rad) for immunoglobulin purification. A sandwich ELISA similar to that used for avian LPL (33Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was set up with the following exceptions. Samples were preincubated in 1.2 m guanidium hydrochloride for 1 h at 4°C and then diluted 5-fold in the assay. The initial incubations of samples with the capture antibodies coated on microtiter plates were conducted at 4 °C in 0.8 m NaCl, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. To enhance sensitivity, the detecting immunoglobulins were coupled to biotin used in conjunction with strepavidin coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The standard curve was linear from 0.01 to 1.5 ng. At 0.1 ng, the net A490 was 0.43. Solid Phase Interaction of RAP and LPL—To preserve the integrity of the lipase, all steps were conducted at 4 °C. Microtiter plates (Corning) were coated (10 ng/well) with highly purified LPL overnight. Control wells were coated with nothing or with an irrelevant protein (carbonic anhydrase (Sigma)). After washing with PBS, 0.05% Tween® 20 (Sigma), plates were blocked overnight with 3% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.05% Tween® 20. After three washes, 200-μl aliquots containing 0–500 ng of GST-RAP or RAP in 1% bovine serum albumin, PBS, 0.05% Tween® 20 were added to each well in triplicate and incubated overnight. All subsequent steps were performed as previously described (34Gershenwald J.E. Bensadoun A. Saluja A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 836: 286-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). After washing, a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat-RAP immunoglobulin was then added to the wells for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C. After washing, binding was detected by reaction of horseradish peroxidase with o-phenylenediamine substrate solution. The A490 was measured after a 30-min incubation in the dark. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR experiments were conducted using a BIAcoreX apparatus (BIAcore Inc.). B1 chips were utilized for immobilization, because they possess a low dextran surface density, thereby decreasing nonspecific LPL interaction. Affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies to RAP were immobilized using amine coupling, according to the manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore Inc.), to a level of ∼2500 resonance units (RU). RU have been shown to be proportional to total binding mass for a wide range of proteins (35Stenberg E. Persson B. Roos H. Urbanicszky C. J. Colloid Interface Sci. 1991; 143: 513-526Crossref Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). Recombinant rat RAP was then injected at concentrations of 300–400 nm to saturate the surface with RAP. The chip was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in running buffer. LPL, freshly diluted in running buffer, was injected. After 450 s, glycine-HCl, pH 2.7, was injected to strip the RAP·LPL complexes from the sensor chip. After equilibration, the process was repeated, using a range of LPL concentrations. For each curve analyzed, nonspecific binding was measured as LPL binding to an anti-RAP surface in the absence of RAP and subtracted from the experimental data. Binding interaction was measured at various flow rates to verify that mass transport was not limiting. In addition, data were fitted to a model utilizing mass transfer rates as an additional variable. Inclusion of mass transfer rates into the fitting did not lead to a significant increase in fit of the binding curves, indicating that the kinetics were not mass transport-limited. Data Analysis—Solid-phase binding data were plotted using SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). Curves were fitted using a rectangular hyperbolic saturation curve: y = a × x/(KD + x), where y represents the bound ligand, x is the free ligand, a is the maximum amount of bound ligand, and KD is the dissociation constant for binding. SPR data were analyzed using BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIAcore Inc.). This program allows for simultaneous global fitting of an entire concentration series of injected ligand. Global fitting provides a robust and stable fitting and reflects physical interaction systems more faithfully (36Schuck P. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 498-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 37Karlsson R. Falt A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 38Mason T. Pineda A.R. Wofsy C. Goldstein B. Math. Biosci. 1999; 159: 123-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Animal Use—RAP knock-out mice and control mice of the same background strain (C57BL/6J) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were housed in sterile cages and given free access to autoclaved food and water. Procedures were approved by Cornell University IRB under protocol 97-98. Cell Culture—Primary murine preadipocytes were harvested after the procedure of Litthauer and Serrero (39Litthauer D. Serrero G. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. A. 1992; 101: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Wild-type or RAP knockout mice less than 4 weeks old were sacrificed under CO2. The mice were quickly immersed in 95% ethanol and dissected. Inguinal and abdominal fat pads were removed and placed into Hanks' balanced salt solution that contained 0.2 mg/ml gentamycin. The tissue was rinsed through two more 50-ml tubes of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing gentamycin. The fat pads were weighed and then placed in prewarmed digestion buffer (4% BSA, 0.3% collagenase in Hanks' balanced salt solution). With scissors, the fat was minced in the digestion buffer tube. The tissue/digestion buffer mixture was then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with shaking. The digested fat was filtered through nylon filters (250 μm and 150 μm) and then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The floating adipocytes were aspirated and discarded. Growth medium was then added to the preadipocytes (10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, PNS antibiotic mixture (Invitrogen), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium MCDB 153 (1:1), 0.5% methyl cellulose). The cells were spun, the medium was removed by aspiration, and the cells were resuspended in growth medium by gentle repeated pipetting. Cells were counted using trypan blue to assess viability. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells/well. Upon reaching 80% confluence, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (1 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 μg/ml insulin in growth medium). After 2–3 days, the differentiation medium was changed to triglyceride medium (0.02% intralipid triglyceride solution, 10 μg/ml insulin in growth medium). After 10–14 days, cells were about 90% confluent, and no further differentiation was noticeable. The 3T3-F442A cells were obtained from Dr. Howard Green (Harvard Medical School). 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from ATCC. They were maintained and differentiated as described (40Landry R. Rioux V. Bensadoun A. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation of Purified RAP and LPL Proteins—RAP (500 ng) and LPL (500 ng) were preincubated for 15 min at room temperature in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin in a final volume of 100 μl. The solution was preincubated with 12 μg of control IgG coupled to Immunobeads (Irvine Scientific) for 1 h at 4°C, and the beads were separated by centrifugation. The RAP·LPL complexes in the supernatant were precipitated with ∼12 μg of anti-RAP immunoglobulins coupled to Immunobeads. This immunoprecipitation was carried out for 90 min at 4 °C in a total volume of 225 μl with the following final concentrations: 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 0.05% SDS, 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS supplemented with an anti-protease mix. The Immunobeads were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with 0.1% N-laurylsarcosine in PBS, and the bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-chicken LPL immunoglobulins. The blots were visualized with the Pierce West Pico Substrate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-immunoprecipitation of LPL · RAP Complexes in Cell Lysates—3T3-F442A cells were grown to confluence and differentiated to adipocytes as described previously (40Landry R. Rioux V. Bensadoun A. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 497-504PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were concentrated by scraping cells in PBS followed by low speed centrifugation. Cell pellets from four 100-mm dishes were lysed and sonicated twice for 30 s in 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF in PBS supplemented with anti-protease mixtures and, when indicated, 0.05% SDS. Co-immunoprecipitation was then carried out as described above for purified proteins. Co-immunoprecipitation of RAP·LPL Complexes in Glioblastoma U87 Cells—U87 cells were grown to confluence in 60-mm dishes in minimal essential medium supplemented with NaHCO3, HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 2 mm glutamine. Cells were transfected with plasmids (4 μg of DNA/plasmid/60-mm dish) expressing either RAP(pCDNA3-RAP), avian LPL(pRcCMV-LPL) (41Sendak R.A. Melford K. Kao A. Bensadoun A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 633-646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or with both plasmids using the FuGENE™ Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science). The RAP expression vector was generated by excising the RAP coding sequence from pGEX-KG-RAP with BamHI and XhoI and cloning into the same restriction sites of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen V790-20). Total DNA employed was normalized to 8 μg/dish with empty vector. Forty-eight h after transfection, cells were lysed (1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF supplemented with an anti-protease mixture). The lysate was sonicated (twice at 100 watts for 20 s) and cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. Lysates from 10 dishes were immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-RAP immunoglobulins for 10 min on a shaker at room temperature, and the complexes were captured with 40 μl of a 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose™. The matrix was washed six times with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 in PBS, and the bound proteins were released with 2× Laemmli's buffer at 65 °C for 30 min. Following removal of the beads by centrifugation, 2-mercaptoethanol was added to the supernatant to a concentration of 5%, and proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE prior to transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and Western blotting with anti-avian LPL immunoglobulins as described above. Cross-linking—3T3-L1 adipocytes were grown to confluence in 500-cm2 dishes. Cross-linking was carried out at 37 °C for 20 min with 1% formaldehyde essentially as described by Hall and Struhl (42Hall D.B. Struhl K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46043-46050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Each dish was washed with TBS (0.15 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) and lysed in 7 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture). The lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 32 min. The cleared lysate was then incubated for 3 h at 4°C with 108 μg of control or anti-LPL immunoglobulins coupled to immunobeads. The beads were washed twice with each of the following buffers 1–4, in sequence: buffer 1, lysis buffer supplemented with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS and adjusted to pH 7.5; buffer 2, buffer 1 supplemented with 0.35 m NaCl; buffer 3, 10 mm Tris-base, pH 8.0, 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate; buffer 4, 10 mm Tris-base, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. The bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS at 60 °C, the beads were separated by centrifugation, and 10× Laemmli and 2-mercaptoethanol were added to the eluted material. After reversing the cross-linking by heating at 95 °C for 20 min, aliquots of the eluate were employed for SDS-PAGE and Western blotting for RAP and LPL. Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation—RAP and/or LPL were preincubated for 2 h at 4°C in BSA/TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% BSA). The various RAP/LPL mixtures were then layered upon sucrose gradients. Sucrose gradients were prepared as follows. Sucrose was added to BSA/TBS to create 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15% sucrose solutions. Two ml of each solution were layered in 14 × 95-mm Ultra-Clear ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman or Seton Scientific) at 4 °C. After adding RAP/LPL mixtures to the top of the gradient, the tubes were centrifuged in an SW41 rotor for 18 h at 38,000 rpm at 4 °C. Fractions were removed from the tubes by aspiration and placed on ice. RAP and LPL protein in each fraction were assayed by ELISA, as described previously. The refractive index of each fraction was measured by a hand-held refractometer (American Optical). Molecular mass estimation was attained by subjecting molecular mass standards to sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation under identical conditions as above. The molecular mass standards utilized were alchohol dehydrogenase (150,000 daltons), BSA (66,000 and 132,000 daltons), carbonic anhydrase (29,000 daltons), myosin or beta-amylase (200,000 or 205,000 daltons, respectively), and ovalbumin (45,000 daltons). One mg of each molecular mass standard was layered upon the sucrose gradient in the same volume of TBS as the RAP/LPL mixtures. After ultracentrifugation, fractions were aspirated as above. Fractions were assayed for protein by measuring A280 using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer. The refractive index for each fraction was measured as above. The plot of log Mr against the refractive index was fitted to a quadratic equation, y =–15,910 + 23,580x – 8734x2 (r2 = 0.982), where y is the log Mr and x is the refractive index. Other Methods—The LPL activity assay was performed according to previously published methods (43Bensadoun A. Marita R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 879: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Avian LPL was purified from acetone powders of chicken fat (44Bensadoun A. Hsu J. Hughes L.B. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 109: 145-150PubMed Google Scholar). Avian LPL ELISA was carried out as described previously (33Cisar L.A. Hoogewerf A.J. Cupp M. Rapport C.A. Bensadoun A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1767-1774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The endoglycosidase H digestion was performed according to Cisar et al. (45Cisar L.A. Bensadoun A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 927: 305-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), following acetone precipitation in the presence of 10 μg of BSA.

Using cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, we observed that a change in stress exponent from 5 to 2.5 correlates strongly with a decrease in grain size from about 40 to 6 micrometers. The grain size–sensitive creep of ice II demonstrated here plausibly dominates plastic strain at the low-stress conditions in the interior of medium- to large-sized icy moons of the outer solar system."
https://openalex.org/W2023492746,"The nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a multifunctional protein that is implicated in viral replication and pathogenesis. We report here that NS5A of HCV-1a is cleaved at multiple sites by caspase proteases in transfected cells. Two cleavage sites at positions Asp154 and 248DXXD251 were mapped. Cleavage at Asp154 has been previously recognized as one of the caspase cleavage sites for the NS5A protein of HCV genotype 1b (1, 2) and results in the production of a 17-kDa fragment. The sequence 248DXXD251 is a novel caspase recognition motif for NS5A and is responsible for the production of a 31-kDa fragment. Furthermore, we show that Arg217 is implicated in the production of the previously described 24-kDa product, whose accumulation is affected by both calpain and caspase inhibitors. We also showed that caspase-mediated cleavage occurs in the absence of exogenous proapoptotic stimuli and is not related to the accumulation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Interestingly, our data indicate that NS5A is targeted by at least two different caspases and suggest that caspase 6 is implicated in the production of the 17-kDa fragment. Most importantly, we report that, all the detectable NS5A fragments following caspase-mediated cleavage are C-terminal-truncated forms of NS5A and are mainly localized in the cytosol. Thus, in sharp contrast to the current view we found no evidence supporting a role for caspase-mediated cleavage in the transport of the NS5A protein to the nucleus, which could lead to transcriptional activation."

https://openalex.org/W2080705901,"Genome damage is a hallmark of human cancer. Efforts at assessing the impact of genome damage on tumor phenotype and patients outcome have focused on measurements of the relative DNA content in tumor cells compared to normal cells and the assessment of allelic loss at single or multiple selected loci that are thought to harbor genes important in cancer biology. We adapted a global, high-resolution genotyping method for determination of global and unbiased allelic loss. We generated a score, termed global genome damage score (GGDS), that is a continuous variable from zero to one and a measure of the extent of damaged DNA in individual tumors. In 71 patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer, the GGDS ranged from 0.0006 to 0.5530 with a median value of 0.0401 indicating that between 0.06 and 55.3% of the genome has allelic loss. Patients with high scores (>0.04) had a significantly worse outcome than those with low scores (median overall survival time 35.5 vs >120.0 months, P=0.006 log-rank test; median disease-free survival 28.3 vs >120.0 months, P=0.003 log-rank test). This suggests that the clinical behavior of lung tumors with low GGDS is relatively benign whereas tumors with high GGDS are aggressive resulting in early death of patients."
