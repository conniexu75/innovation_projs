https://openalex.org/W2000314850,"A hypothetical model of the active site of angiotensin-converting enzyme, based on known chemical and kinetic properties of the enzyme, has enabled us to design a new class of potent and specific inhibitors. These compounds, carboxyalkanoyl and mercaptoalkanoyl derivatives of proline, inhibit the contractile response of guinea pig ileal strip to angiotensin I and augment its response to bradykinin. When administered orally to rats, these agents inhibit the pressor effect of angiotensin I, augment the vasodepressor effect of bradykinin, and lower blood pressure in a model of renovascular hypertension."

https://openalex.org/W1598316265,"The catalytic subunit of rabbit skeletal muscle cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase has been isolated in pure form. It has a molecular weight of 41,300, as determined by sedimentation equilibrium, which is in good agreement with the value of 41,000 determined by electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Sedimentation velocity determinations indicate that the subunit has an S20,w value of 3.12 which is essentially independent of protein concentration. These experiments are interpreted as indicating that the catalytic subunit dissociated from the holoenzyme exists as a monomer in solution. The least abundant amino acid is half-cystine, which was calculated to be present at 2.8 mol/mol of protein. The sulfhydryl reagents, N-ethylmaleimide, p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) inhibit the enzymatic activity of the subunit; inhibition by the two latter compounds can be reversed by 2-mercaptoethanol. Binding of 1 mol of N-ethylmaleimide/mol of protein results in almost complete inhibition. The isolated catalytic subunit contains 2.2 mol of tightly bound phosphate/mol of protein. Identification of either O-phosphoserine or O-phosphothreonine after partial acid hydrolysis indicates that at least part of the endogeneous phosphate exists as the phospho ester of one of these amino acids. Two peaks of catalytic activity corresponding to isoelectric points of pH 7.4 and 8.5 were identified by isoelectric focusing. Both forms utilize the same substrates and have similar sedimentation constants."

https://openalex.org/W2023687016,"Helenalin and tenulin injected into CF1 male mice bearing Ehrlich ascites tumors inhibit DNA synthesis and DNA polymerase enzymatic activity in the tumor cells. Helenalin inhibited protein synthesis. Both drugs increased the concentration of adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate, and interfered with glycolytic and mitochondrial energy processes. Cholesterol synthesis was also inhibited, resulting in lower serum cholesterol levels in tumor-bearing animals. Data obtained in vitro indicate that the cyclopentenone-bearing sesquiterpene lactone and related compounds do not alkylate purine bases of nucleic acids but rather undergo a Michael-type addition reaction with the sulfhydryl groups of reduced glutathione and L-cysteine. Thus, the inhibition of cellular enzyme activities and metabolism that has been observed with these drugs might be explained by the occurrence of a Michael-type reaction."

https://openalex.org/W1488907063,"The dehydrogenation reaction of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol (I) to cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol (II) in the presence of NADH was studied in rat liver microsomes and in microsomal acetone powder preparations, using [3alpha-3H]cholest-7-en-3beta-ol. It was found that the reaction was inhibited by menadione, adenosine diphosphate, potassium ferricyanide, and cytochrome c while p-cresol had no effect. These results indicated the participation of a microsomal electron transport system in the dehydrogenation of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol. The conversion of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol to cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol was also observed in the absence of NADH when ascorbic acid was included in the incubation mixture. However, the ascorbic acid-catalyzed dehydrogenation was not inhibited by potassium ferricyanide. Immunological evidence that microsomal cytochrome b5 is involved in the dehydrogenation of (I) to (II) was obtained. Antibodies specific for rat liver microsomal cytochrome b5 were elicited in rabbits. The anticytochrome b5 immunoglobulin fraction inhibited rat liver microsomal NADH-cytochrome c reductase but not NADPH-cytochrome c reductase. Also, the extent of reduction of cytochrome b5 was not affected by the antibodies. The conversion of (I) to (II) by rat liver microsomes was inhibited (73%) by anticytochrome b5 immunoglobulin at a ratio of microsomal protein:immunoglobulin of 1:5.6. These results are consistent with the participation of microsomal cytochrome b5 in the introduction of the C-5 double bond in cholesterol biosynthesis. A close analogy of the microsomal dehydrogenation of fatty acids and of cholest-7-en-3beta-ol is apparent and this suggests a possible similarity in the mechanisms of the two reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1509910850,"Phosphodiesterase activator protein and troponin-C have been purified from rat testis and rabbit skeletal muscle, respectively. The two proteins appear to be structurally distinct since the activator protein migrates faster than troponin-C on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Each of the calcium-binding proteins will, however, substitute for the other in their respective biological systems. Testis activator protein forms a complex with rabbit muscle troponin subunits TnI and TnT soluble in low salt. This hybrid complex (AIT) can regulate rabbit skeletal muscle actomyosin ATPase activity. AIT regulation, although influenced by free Aa2+ levels, is distinct from that of native troponin. Likewise, muscle troponin-C can substitute for activator protein in the stimulation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase. Troponin-C will fully stimulate phosphodiesterase although its affinity is 600-fold lower than that of activator protein. Ca2+ regulation studies demonstrate that both proteins require micormolar levels of free Ca2+ to induce phosphodiesterase activation. Activator protein requires 1.2 x 10(6) M and troponin-C, 1.9 X 10(6) M free Ca2+ for half-maximal stimulation of phosphodiesterase. The biological cross-reactivity of these proteins supports the sequence homology recently reported by Watterson et al. (Watterson, D.M., Harrelson, W.G., Keller, P.M., Sharief, F., and Vanaman, T.C. (1976) J.Biol. Chem. 251, 4501-4513). In addition, this preliminary study suggests that this nonmuscle troponin-C-like protein potentially may function in other Ca2+-regulated cellular events in addition to its moculation of cyclic nucleotide levels."

Assays based on the conversion of CDP-[14C]choline of CDP-[14C]ethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine utilized ethanol-dispersed diacylglycerols and 1 to 5 microng of protein. Cholinephosphotransferase and ethanolaminephosphotransferase activities had similar dependences on MgCl2 and pH, and were inhibited similarly by CaCl2, organic solvents, Triton X-100, Tween 20, and dithiothreitol. Ethylene glycol bis(beta-amino-ethyl ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid stimulated both activities similarly. With 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, the cholinephosphotransferase activity had an apparent Km for CDP-choline of 23.9 micronM and a V max of 8.54 nmol/min/mg. CDP-ethanolamine and CDP were competitive inhibitors of the cholinephosphotransferase activity (apparent Kl values of 227 micronM and 360 micronM, respectively). With 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol, the ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity had an apparent Km of 18.3 micronM for CDP-ethanolamine and a V max of 1.14 nmol/min/mg. CDP-choline appeared to be a noncompetitive inhibitor of the ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity (apparent Kl of 1620 micronM). Inhibition of the ethanolaminephosphotransferase activity by CDP appeared to be of a mixed type.

https://openalex.org/W1574030318,"A phosphoprotein phosphatase that catalyzes the dephosphorylation of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase from bovine cardiac muscle has been purified to homogeneity by a modification of the procedure of Brandt et al. (Brandt, H., Capulong, Z.L., and Lee, E. Y. C. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8038-8044). Treatment of the enzyme preparation with ethanol during the early stages of purification results in activation concomitant with reduction in molecular weight to 30,000. The purified activated enzyme has a Km for phospho-protein kinase in the presence or absence of 1.2 mM Mn2+ of 5 and 22 micronM, respectively. Phosphatase activity on phospho-protein kinase but not on other phosphoprotein substrates was cAMP-dependent. This selective activation by cAMP reflects the preference of the phosphatase for the free, phosphorylated cAMP-binding protein rather than the phosphoholoenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1512340857,"Vesicular fragments of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) were labeled with the --SH-directed spin label 2,2,6,6-tetra-methyl,4-amino(N-iodoacetamide). Colorimetric titrations of the remaining --SH residues and determinations of unbound spin label indicated that primarily 3 residues/enzyme molecule were labeled under saturating conditions. This labeling was accompanied by minimal losses in activity, providing precautions were taken to prevent sulfhydryl oxidation during the labeling process. Additions of ATP produced a new highly constrained component in the ESR spectrum of the labeled SR, an effect not noted in previous studies. It is demonstrated that the changes produced by ATP are reversible, and require both substrate binding and Ca2+ binding. However, hydrolysis of the substrate is not required. It is further demonstrated that the labeled residue(s) responsible for the spectral change is not in the immediate vicinity of the ATP binding site. It is apparent that the observed spectral change is related to a conformational effect of ATP and Ca2+ on the ATPase protein, which is associated with a large free energy change occurring on binding. It is also suggested that the conformational effect extends to a significant distance from the nucleotide binding site and may be a precursory step to Ca2+ translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1568806088,"Treatment of rat liver plasma membranes with various commercial preparations of crude collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum at concentrations as low as 1 mug/ml, resulted in activation of the adenylate cyclase system. Maximal activation occurred at 50 to 100 mug/ml of collagenase, and promoted a 2- to 3-fold increase in the basal activity as well as in the activities stimulated by catecholamines, glucagon, fluoride, or GTP. This was due to an increase in the maximal velocity of the cyclizing reaction without any increase in the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. Treatment of plasma membranes with crude collagenase did not induce gross structural modifications as judged by electron microscopic examination. 5'-Nucleotidase activity was slightly inhibited and ATPase activity remained unaffected. The stimulatory substance was nondialyzable, thermolabile, and inhibited by both EDTA and -SH reagents, thus appearing to be a protein. The following observations suggest the effects observed were due to other protease(s) present in crude collagenase: (a) only crude collagenase was active on liver adenylate cyclase: treatment with purified collagenase from C. histolyticum or from Achromobacter iophagus gave no stimulation; (b) the stimulatory activity was irreversible since washing of the membranes after treatment was without effect; (c) crude collagenase contained no lecithinase or sphingomyelinase activity under our conditions of adenylate cyclase assay; (d) after chromatography on Sephadex G-100, the activator appeared as a peak in the 30,000-dalton region and was clearly separated from the collagenase and clostripain peaks, but coincident with elastolytic and caseinolytic activities; (e) the effect of crude collagenase could be prevented by addition of elastin in vitro and was mimicked by purified elastase from hog pancreas. It remains to be seen whether the effects observed result from an increase in the catalytic constant of adenylate cyclase, or an unmasking of new catalytic sites."

https://openalex.org/W1524960714,"Incubation of purified cyclic guanosine 3':5'-monophospate-dependent protein kinase with [gamma-32P]ATP and Mg2+ led to formation of one 32P-labeled protein, Mr = 75,000, which corresponded to the single protein band detected after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. When electrophoresis was performed without detergent, the labeled protein coincided with the position of cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Phosphorylation was enhanced severalfold by either histone or cAMP and was inhibited by the addition of cGMP. Low concentrations of cGMP blocked the stimulatory effects of cAMP or histone (or both). Since neither cAMP-dependent protein kinase nor cGMP-dependent phosphoprotein phosphatase activities were detected in the purified enzyme, we concluded that the cGMP-dependent protein kinase is a substrate for its own phosphotransferase activity and that other protein substrates (histone) and cyclic nucleotides modulate the process of self-phosphorylation."

All three populations are rich in phospholipids (64.9 to 67.5%) and cholesterol (23.0 to 26.8%) but poor in cholesteryl esters (0.4 to 1.9%), triglycerides (1.8 to 3.2%), and protein (3.2 to 6.7%) with differences in chemical composition which result in buoyant densities (1.038, 1.049, and 1.058, respectively) to allow their separation. LP-X1, LP-X2, and LP-X3 exhibited apparent flotation rates of 17.3, 9.7, and 3.2 Svedbergs and Stokes radii of 339, 343, and 294 A, respectively. As determined from circular dichroic measurements, the protein constituents of all three particles possessed a high degree of alpha helical structure (41 to 65%).

https://openalex.org/W2167772745,"The lipid hydrocarbon chains in the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria appear from previous experiments to be less mobile than in the cytoplasmic membrane. To determine whether lipopolysaccharide, a unique outer membrane component, is a cause of this restricted mobility, outer membranes differing in the amount of lipopolysaccharide, and the length of the polysaccharide side chain, were prepared from Escherichia coli J5. Cytoplasmic membranes were prepared for comparison. The probes, 5- and 12-doxylstearate, were introduced into these membranes, electron spin resonance spectra were analyzed, and the order parameter (S) and empirical motion parameter (tau0) were calculated. Outer membrane preparations containing long chain lipopolysaccharide were much less fluid by these criteria than were preparations containing short chain lipopolysaccharide. Removing about 40% of the lipopolysaccharide from the former preparations greatly increased their fluidity. The lipid in the cytoplasmic membrane preparations was more fluid than in the outer membrane and cytoplasmic membranes were similar to each other regardless of the composition of the outer membrane. These results indicate that lipopolysaccharide, and especially the polysaccharide portion, directly or indirectly causes the restricted mobility of the lipid hydrocarbon chains observed in the outer membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1512244543,"The participation of superoxide anion (O2-) in the intracellular indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was studied using the dispersed cell suspension of the rabbit small intestine. The dioxygenase activity was assayed by measuring [14C]formate released from DL-[ring-2-14C]tryptophan. The addition of diethyldiethiocarbamate, a superoxide dismutase inhibitor, markedly accelerated the intracellular dioxygenase activity while the superoxide dismutase activity decreased concomitantly. Furthermore, substrates of xanthine oxidase such as inosine, adenosine, and hypoxanthine also increased the dioxygenase activity in the cells, particularly in the presence of methylene blue. This increase was completely abolished by the addition of allopurinol, a specific inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. These results, taken together, indicate that the intracellular accumulation of O2- results in acceleration of the in situ dioxygenase activity, and that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase utilizes O2- in the isolated intestinal cells."

https://openalex.org/W1495274508,"Groups of rats bearing Morris minimal deviation hepatoma 7288CTC were fed a fat-free diet supplemented with either 0.5% safflower oil (diet A), 15% safflower oil or free acids (diets Band C), or 15% safflower oil or free safflower fatty acids (diet D) for 4 weeks. A group of normal rats was also fed diet D. Triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines isolated from livers and hepatomas of animals on each diet were analyzed quantitatively for positional isomers in the cis- and trans-octadecenoate fractions. When sufficient samples could be obtained, the cis- and trans-hexadecenoate fractions were also analyzed. Plasma from normal rats on diet D was analyzed in the same manner. The octadecenoate fractions of all hepatoma and liver lipid classes from animals fed diets A, B, and C were greater than 95% the cis isomers. Trans isomers accounted for approximately 15, 30, 50, and 70% of the octadecenoate fractions isolated from liver triglycerides, cholesteryl esters, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines, respectively, of animals fed diet D. In contrast, all hepatoma lipid classes from animals on diet D contained the same approximate percentage of trans isomers (15 to 20%). Oleic and vaccenic acids were the major positional cis-octadecenoate isomers of all liver and hepatoma lipid classes from animals fed diets A, B, and C. The ratios of oleic to vaccenic, unaffected by diets A, B, and C, differed for each lipid class in liver, but the ratios were similar for the two hepatoma neutral lipid classes and for the two phospholipid classes. The cis-octadecenoate fractions from all liver and hepatoma lipid classes of animals fed diet D consisted predominantly of the delta9, delta11, and delta12 isomers. The cis delta10 isomer, which was a major isomer of the diet, was almost excluded from liver, hepatoma, and plasma lipids. The positional isomers of the trans-octadecenoate fractions from liver and hepatoma triglycerides and cholesteryl esters exhibited the same approximate distribution as the trans fatty acids of diet D. In contrast, the 10-trans-octadecenoate, like 10-cis-octadecenoate, was almost excluded from the phospholipids of liver and plasma. Unlike liver, the hepatoma phospholipids contained 10-trans-octadecenoate at approximately half the percentage of neutral lipids. Because diet D contained no hexadecenoic fatty acids, the occurrence of trans-hexadecenoate isomers in liver and plasma lipids indicated a chain shortening process. Predominance of the 8-trans-hexadecenoate isomer indicated a preference of the 10-trans-octadecenoate isomer for chain shortening."

https://openalex.org/W1564728203,"The major protein components from human and bovine high density serum lipoproteins (apo-A-I proteins) were investigated in their interactions with L-alpha-myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine and L-alpha-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine. Complex formation was followed by 25 degrees by observing changes in fluorescence polarization, rotational relaxation times (ph), and CD spectra of the proteins, covalently labeled with fluorescent dimethylaminonaphthalene sulfonyl groups. Monomeric human apo-A-I and initially oligomeric bovine apo-A-I interact with similar efficiency with the same amphiphiles. During binding of L-alpha-myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine and L-alpha-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine, the structure of both proteins changes drastically, exhibiting about 35% increases in secondary structure with the phospholipid and about 20% increases with the lysophospholipid. Simultaneously, regions of the proteins adjacent to the fluorescent probes become more mobile. With the bovine protein, binding of both amphiphiles results in changes in the oligomeric structure: dissociation with L-alpha-myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine and dissociation or rearrangement with L-alpha-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine. The complexes formed in the presence of excess L-alpha-myristoyl lysophosphatidylcholine are flexible structures with considerable rotational freedom. The largest rotational unit in these complexes has ph = 60 ns for both proteins; by comparison, the monometic human apo-A-I has a ph = 73.5 ns. Interactions of both proteins with the lysophospholipid take place well above its critical micelle concentration, but probably involve binding of monomeric lipid. With L-alpha-dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine the complexes are different from those formed with the lysophospholipid. They have limiting ph values of 250 +/- 50 and 280 +/- 60 ns with the human and bovine proteins, respectively. These ph values are consistent with particles of the general size of human high density lipoprotein rather than of liposomes and indicate the formation of distinct, relatively small structures upon interaction of the self-associated lipid with the apo-A-I-proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1479898340,"Analysis of titration data of EF-Tu-GDP with Mn(II) where free and bound Mn(II) were determined by proton relaxation rate of water (PRR) yields one tight Mn(II) binding site and a value of 2 muM for the dissociation constant of Mn(II) from the EF-Tu-MnGDP complex, K'A. The dissociation constant of manganese nucleotide from the ternary EF-Tu-MnGDP complex, K2, 0.2 muM, was derived from the known value of Ks, the dissociation constant for the binary EF-Tu-GDP complex, and the titration data of the ternary complex with excess GDP as titrant. The apparent number, n, of rapidly exchanging water ligands coordinated to bound Mn(II) in the ternary complex EF-Tu-MnGDP is estimated from the frequency dependence of the PRR of the complex to be approximately 1. The value of n and the values of PRR enhancements, epsilont = 4.3 for EF-Tu-MnGDP at 21 degrees, 24.3 MHZ and epsilont = 4.1 for the ternary GTP complex, are unusually low for protein-Mn-nucleotide complexes. The antibiotic X5108 which induces GTPase activity in EF-Tu-MgGTP was shown to bind stoichiometrically to EF-Tu-MnGDP and thereby change the PRR enhancement of the complex from 4.3 to 7.4. The characteristic broad lines in the EPR spectra of Mn(II) nucleotides are strikingly narrowed upon binding of Mn(II) nucleotides to EF-Tu. The long electron spin relaxation times inferred from the EPR spectra indicate a limited access of solvent water to the first coordination sphere of Mn(II) in its EF-Tu-nucleotide complexes. The frequency dependence of the PRR indicates that the electron spin relaxation time, T1e, is the dominant process modulating the Mn(II)-H2O interaction of the EF-Tu-MnGDP complex and consequently determines the correlation time. The value of T1e, estimated from the PRR experiments to be 2.5 ns at 21 degrees, is consistent with the lower limit of T1e obtained from the line widths of the EPR spectrum of the complex. Upon binding of a stoichiometric quantity of the antibiotic X5108, the EPR spectrum of EF-Tu-MnGDP is severely broadened indicating greater access of solvent water to the manganese coordination sphere, i.e. an opening of the nucleotide binding site as already suggested by the increased PRR enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1531134911,"Abstract The present study was designed to identify the physicochemical, immunologic, and biologic properties of the immunoreactive glucagon (IRG) moieties of canine gastric fundus and to compare them with those of the canine pancreas. Acid-alcohol extracts of the gastric fundus and pancreas of dogs were subjected to Bio-Gel P-10 chromatography, The elution profiles of extracts of both organs revealed IRG peaks in the Mr = 2,000 3,500, and 9,000 zones; in the gastric extracts, a void volume peak was also present. On the basis of Sephadex G-150 rechromatography and sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation the latter IRG was estimated to have a Mr = 65,000. Incubation of fundic IRG65,000 in 8 M urea failed to alter its elution position. Its pI was 6.4, while fundic IRG3,500 had a pI of 6.15 and pancreatic glucagon 6.25.Fundic IRG9,000 had a pI of 4.5 and pancreatic IRG9,000 4.65. Dilution curves of these three fundic and two pancreatic IRGs were parallel to crystalline beef-pork glucagon. The glycogenolytic activity of fundic IRG3,500 and IRG65,000, measured in the isolated rat liver system, was not different from that of immunoequivalent amounts of dog pancreatic glucagon or crystalline beef-pork glucagon. Both fundic and pancreatic IRG9,000 were devoid of glycogenolytic activity and lacker adenylate cyclase stimulating activity and 125I-glucagon displacing activity when tested on partially purified rat liver membranes. Fundic IRG65,000, however, stimulated adenylate cyclase and displaced 125I-glucagon to the same degree as immunoequivalent amounts of pancreatic glucagon. Fundic IRG3,500 was more active than pancreatic glucagon in stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. This was not clearly attributable to differences in binding to liver cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1676782231,"This study presents the results of a kinetic investigation of adenylate cyclase in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. In the presence of a saturating concentration of substrate (1 mM), the basal activity was increased severalfold by increasing Mg2+ from 1 to 25 mM. A Hill coefficient of 1.9 was obtained for Mg2+ or ATP. The data suggest cooperative interactions between the substrate binding sites in the neutrophil adenylate cyclase complex. It has been observed that guanyl-5'-yl imidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p) (S0.5 = 10 MUM) significantly increased and Ca2+ (S0.5 = 0.5 MM) significantly decreased only the Vmax without affecting the Hill coefficient or S0.5 for ATP. The Hill coefficients for Ca2+ or Gpp(NH)p were 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. The Hill coefficient for Ca2+ was not changed by the increased Gpp(NH)p concentrations. It appears that neutrophil adenylate cyclase has distinct binding sites for Gpp(NH)p and Ca2+, one for each compond. The binding of ligands is not changed by the other effectors and the action is directed only toward the Vmax of the enzyme. The stimulatory action of positive effectors (prostaglandin E1, isoproterenol, histamine) was enhanced by Gpp(NH)p and depressed by Ca2+. No preferential stimulation by Gpp(NH)p nor inhibition by Ca2+ of the action of the positive effectors has been found. The data suggests that only one type of catalytic subunit responds to the action of several positive effectors. Extracellular Gpp(NH)p or Ca2+ do not affect the cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) level in whole neutrophils and the effect of positive effectors on cAMP production is also not significantly changed by 5 mM Ca2+ or 0.1 mM Gpp(NH)p. Ionophore A23187 in the presence of 5 mM Ca2+ enhances Ca2+ entry into cells and decreases the basal cAMP formation. It appears that Gpp(NH)p or Ca2+ act only at the intracellular site of the adenylate cyclase complex."

The occurrence of a polyprenol derivative of GlcUA-(1 leads to 4)-GlcNAc suggests a possible role for this lipid in the biosynthesis of the repeating disaccharide units of proteoglycans, such as heparin."

Radioimmunoassays of ferritin and of its protein subunits in various cell fractions after biosynthetic labeling with [14C]leucine were done by means of ferritin-specific and subunit-specific rabbit antibody. In both ACI rat livers and M-5123-C1 hepatoma cells free polyribosomes synthesized approximately 81% of the protein subunits of ferritin, and membrane-bound polyribosomes synthesized the rest. In both polyribosomal fractions, [14C]leucine-labeled subunits were detected earlier than [14C]leucine-labeled ferritin and apoferritin (5 min as against 30 min after initiation of a pulse). Time sequence studies of the shifts of biosynthetically labeled subunits and ferritin through different cell compartments provided evidence for vectorial transport of subunits and of ferritin, the direction of transport being from the two polyribosomal systems to the smooth membrane compartment and to the cytosol."

https://openalex.org/W1600888581,"The effects of various ions commonly found in protein kinase assays upon the rate of histone phosphorylation catalyzed by the highly purified bovine brain enzyme, protein kinase I, have been investigated. Sodium, potassium, and magnesium were found to inhibit histone phosphorylation by protein kinase I in a similar manner. The degree of inhibition by any of these cations was demonstrated to be directly proportional to the square root of the ionic strength of the assay medium. The relationship between the ionic strength of the assay medium and the rate of histone phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase I was employed to correct the rate of histone phosphorylation at various magnesium acetate concentrations to a standard ionic strength. When this was done an analysis of the previously postulated rate law for histone phosphorylation c atalyzed by protein kinase I gave a binding constant for the magnesium-ATP complex which was in agreement with that expected for this complex on the basis of various binding constants available in the literature. These results demonstrate that it is unnecessary to postulate a specific ion inhibition process for protein kinase I by the ions employed in this study. They also support the reasonable assumption that magnesium ion binds to ATP at or prior to the rate-determining step in histone phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinase I. The expression developed in this paper for the effect of ionic strength upon protein kinase I activity can now be used to correct activity measurements made under various assay conditions to a standard assay state, allowing facile comparisons of kinetic data. It should be possible to develop similar expressions for other protein kinases and substrates to permit useful interpretation of kinetic data."

https://openalex.org/W1576824306,"Ferritin and its protein subunits in rat hepatoma cell clone M-5123-C1 were biosynthetically labeled with [14C]leucine and 59Fe. Radioimmunoassays of ferritin/apoferritin and of protein subunits in the free polyribosome, membrane-bound polyribosome, smooth membrane, and cytosol fractions were done with ferritin-specific and subunit-specific rabbit IgG antibodies at various time intervals after pulsing. Much more 59Fe was bound by ferritin/apoferritin than by subunits in all of the cell fractions. Binding of iron to subunits may have been a random process. When hepatoma cells were simultaneously pulse-labeled with 59Fe and [14C]leucine, uptake of much of the 59Fe by ferritin occurred relatively early, in comparison to incorporation of [14C]leucine, in all of the cell fractions examined. Thus, 59Fe was readily incorporated into pre-existing ferritin. We conclude that most, if not nearly all, of the iron is incorporated after assembly of protein subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1586577409,"Bovine liver and mammary UDP-galactose-4-epimerases were investigated with respect to various inhibitors and inactivators. Uridine nucleotides and NADH are potent inhibitors with Ki values in the low micromolar range. The NAD+/NADH ratio may be an important physiological control mechanism for it affects markedly the activity of the enzyme with 50% inhibition occurring at a ratio of 20:1. In the presence of uridine nucleotides binding of NADH to the epimerases is enhanced. Consequently, the effect of changes in the NAD+/NADH ratio in vivo would not be immediately apparent as uridine nucleotides would slow down the displacement of NADH by NAD+. Neither uridine nor galactose 1-phosphate inhibits the purified enzymes as previously reported with the impure liver enzyme. Uridine nucleotides provide almost total protection against the apparent first order inactivation of the epimerases by trypsin and allow determination of dissociation constants. NAD+ partially protects against trypsin inactivation. Inactivation with various sulfhydryl reagents is complex and the results indicate that at least three sulfhydryl groups may be modified before total inactivation occurs. Partial inactivation occurs upon modification of the epimerases with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrogenzyl bromide. Some protection against this modification is provided by the combination of NAD+ and UDP."
https://openalex.org/W1578178544,"The effects of nucleoside triphosphates and oligoribonucleotides on the initiation of synthesis of messenger RNA of the T4 phage-specific enzyme, deoxynucleotide kinase, have been studied. The procedure involved incubation of T4 DNA, purified RNA polymerase from Escherichia coli, and selected nucleotide compounds during a brief period to permit initiation of RNA synthesis. Further initiation was arrested by the addition of ribampicin, and completion of the transcription of the newly initiated RNA was permitted to take place in the presence of the full complement of nucleoside triphosphates. After translation of the messenger RNA into phage-specific enzymes, the measured activities of the latter whe first incubation period. The effectiveness of individual nucleoside triphosphates, when present singly or in combination during the initiation period, was compared to that when all four nucleoside triphosphates were available. ATP alone was extremely effective as an initiator of the synthesis of the messenger RNA for deoxynucleotide kinase. The addition of UTP to ATP not only enhanced the magnitude of initiation but also affected the kinetics of ATP interaction with T4 DNA and RNA polymerase during the initiation period. Several oligoribonucleotides including a series ApA to ApApApA, UpU to UpUpUpU, and the heteropolymers, Ap1pU and ApApApU, were tested as initiators of kinase mRNA synthesis. A sequence of nucleotides in the promoter region of T4 DNA for the deoxynucleotide kinase gene has been proposed as a result of these experiments."
