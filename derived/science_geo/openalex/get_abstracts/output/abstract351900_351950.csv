https://openalex.org/W2082260955,"The creation of enzymes capable of catalyzing any desired chemical reaction is a grand challenge for computational protein design. Using new algorithms that rely on hashing techniques to construct active sites for multistep reactions, we designed retro-aldolases that use four different catalytic motifs to catalyze the breaking of a carbon-carbon bond in a nonnatural substrate. Of the 72 designs that were experimentally characterized, 32, spanning a range of protein folds, had detectable retro-aldolase activity. Designs that used an explicit water molecule to mediate proton shuffling were significantly more successful, with rate accelerations of up to four orders of magnitude and multiple turnovers, than those involving charged side-chain networks. The atomic accuracy of the design process was confirmed by the x-ray crystal structure of active designs embedded in two protein scaffolds, both of which were nearly superimposable on the design model."

It has been proposed that the modulus of this tissue is controlled by regulating the interactions among collagen fibrils, which reinforce a low-modulus matrix. We report on a family of polymer nanocomposites, which mimic this architecture and display similar chemoresponsive mechanic adaptability. Materials based on a rubbery host polymer and rigid cellulose nanofibers exhibit a reversible reduction by a factor of 40 of the tensile modulus, for example, from 800 to 20 megapascals (MPa), upon exposure to a chemical regulator that mediates nanofiber interactions. Using a host polymer with a thermal transition in the regime of interest, we demonstrated even larger modulus changes (4200 to 1.6 MPa) upon exposure to emulated physiological conditions."

We used ultrashort pulses in microstructured optical fibers to demonstrate the formation of an artificial event horizon in optics. We observed a classical optical effect: the blue-shifting of light at a white-hole horizon. We also showed by theoretical calculations that such a system is capable of probing the quantum effects of horizons, in particular Hawking radiation."

However, it is not clear whether gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. To assess this issue, we modulated gut microbiota via antibiotics administration in two different mouse models with insulin resistance. Results from dose-determination studies showed that a combination of norfloxacin and ampicillin, at a dose of 1 g/L, maximally suppressed the numbers of cecal aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in ob/ob mice. After a 2-wk intervention with the antibiotic combination, both ob/ob and diet-induced obese and insulin-resistant mice showed a significant improvement in fasting glycemia and oral glucose tolerance. The improved glycemic control was independent of food intake or adiposity because pair-fed ob/ob mice were as glucose intolerant as the control ob/ob mice. Reduced liver triglycerides and increased liver glycogen correlated with improved glucose tolerance in the treated mice. Concomitant reduction of plasma lipopolysaccharides and increase of adiponectin further supported the antidiabetic effects of the antibiotic treatment in ob/ob mice. In summary, modulation of gut microbiota ameliorated glucose tolerance of mice by altering the expression of hepatic and intestinal genes involved in inflammation and metabolism, and by changing the hormonal, inflammatory, and metabolic status of the host."
https://openalex.org/W2067729127,"Chronic hyperglycemia contributes to the development of diabetes-associated complications. Increases in the concentration of circulating glucose activate the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) and promote the O-glycosylation of proteins by O-glycosyl transferase (OGT). We show that OGT triggered hepatic gluconeogenesis through the O-glycosylation of the transducer of regulated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element–binding protein (CREB) 2 (TORC2 or CRTC2). CRTC2 was O-glycosylated at sites that normally sequester CRTC2 in the cytoplasm through a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism. Decreasing amounts of O-glycosylated CRTC2 by expression of the deglycosylating enzyme O-GlcNAcase blocked effects of glucose on gluconeogenesis, demonstrating the importance of the HBP in the development of glucose intolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1971395905,"Glutamate is an essential neurotransmitter regulating brain functions. Excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)-2 is one of the major glutamate transporters primarily expressed in astroglial cells. Dysfunction of EAAT2 is implicated in acute and chronic neurological disorders, including stroke/ischemia, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, human immunodeficiency virus 1-associated dementia, and growth of malignant gliomas. Ceftriaxone, one of the β-lactam antibiotics, is a stimulator of EAAT2 expression with neuroprotective effects in both in vitro and in vivo models based in part on its ability to inhibit neuronal cell death by glutamate excitotoxicity. Based on this consideration and its lack of toxicity, ceftriaxone has potential to manipulate glutamate transmission and ameliorate neurotoxicity. We investigated the mechanism by which ceftriaxone enhances EAAT2 expression in primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFA). Ceftriaxone elevated EAAT2 transcription in PHFA through the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. The antibiotic promoted nuclear translocation of p65 and activation of NF-κB. The specific NF-κB binding site at the -272 position of the EAAT2 promoter was responsible for ceftriaxone-mediated EAAT2 induction. In addition, ceftriaxone increased glutamate uptake, a primary function of EAAT2, and EAAT2 small interference RNA completely inhibited ceftriaxone-induced glutamate uptake activity in PHFA. Taken together, our data indicate that ceftriaxone is a potent modulator of glutamate transport in PHFA through NF-κB-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation. These findings suggest a mechanism for ceftriaxone modulation of glutamate transport and for its potential effects on ameliorating specific neurodegenerative diseases through modulation of extracellular glutamate.

Glutamate plays a central role in brain physiology and pathology (1Fonnum F. J. Neurochem. 1984; 42: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar). It is the major mediator of excitatory signal transduction in the mammalian central nervous system and is implicated in most aspects of normal brain function, including cognition, memory, and learning (2Headley P.M. Grillner S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Glutamate exerts its signaling role by acting on glutamate receptors located on the surface of target cells. Accordingly, it is the glutamate concentration in the surrounding extracellular fluid that determines the extent of receptor stimulation. It is clinically relevant that the extracellular glutamate concentration is maintained at a low level, because excessive activation of glutamate receptors is harmful and glutamate is a potent neurotoxin at high concentration (2Headley P.M. Grillner S. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 205-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The brain contains large quantities of glutamate, but only a small fraction of this glutamate is normally present in the extracellular fluid. Glutamate is constantly being released from cells and is continually being removed from the extracellular fluid (3Anderson C.M. Swanson R.A. Glia. 2000; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Glutamate transporters, also known as excitatory amino acid transporters, regulate this removal of glutamate from the extracellular fluid (3Anderson C.M. Swanson R.A. Glia. 2000; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar).

Swanson R.A. Glia. 2000; 32: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). The predominant glutamate transporters in the brain are EAAT1 and EAAT2, also identified in the rodent as glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) and glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1), respectively, which are primarily expressed in astrocytes (3Anderson C.M.

HIV-1 infection of primary human fetal astrocytes (PHFA) results in down-regulation of both EAAT2 mRNA and protein and also decreases glutamate uptake in these cells (15Wang Z. Pekarskaya O.

In a similar manner, treatment with tumor necrosis factor α, which might be secreted from HIV-infected macrophages, down-regulates both EAAT2 mRNA and protein and also reduces glutamate uptake in PHFA, suggesting an involvement of glutamate excitotoxicity in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated dementia (15Wang Z.

These studies identified β-lactam antibiotics as potent stimulators of GLT-1 expression, not GLAST (20Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C. Huang Y.H. Bergles D.E. Jin L. Dykes Hoberg M.

Hardman J.G. Limbird L.E. Gilman A.G. Goodman & Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics. McGraw Hill Medical Publishing, New York2001Google Scholar). The β-lactam ceftriaxone (CEF) increases both brain expression of EAAT2 and its biochemical and functional activity in vivo and is neuroprotective in vitro in models of ischemic injury and motor neuron degeneration, based in part on protection from glutamate toxicity (20Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C. Huang Y.H. Bergles D.E. Jin L. Dykes Hoberg M. Vidensky S. Chung D.S. Toan S.V. Bruijn L.I. Su Z.Z. Gupta P. Fisher P.B.

CEF also delayed loss of neurons, increased muscle strength, and enhanced mouse survival in an animal model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (20Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C.

Moreover, this action appears to be mediated through increased transcription of the EAAT2 gene (19Su Z.Z. Leszczyniecka M. Kang D.C. Sarkar D. Chao W. Volsky D.J. Fisher P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The sequences of the -272 M probe containing a mutated NF-κB binding site at the -272 position of the EAAT2 promoter are 5′-AGA GGG ATC GCC TGC AAA TCG CCA GCT C-3′. The mutated sequence is underlined. For supershift experiments, 2 μl of anti-p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the reaction mixture and was incubated for 15 min at 4 °C before the addition of probe.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—PHFA seeded onto 4-well chamber slides were infected with Ad.vec or Ad.IκBα-mt32 at 10 plaque-forming units/cell and then treated with or without CEF. Two days later, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescence staining was done with anti-p65 antibody and mounted with mounting medium containing 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole as described (25Emdad L. Sarkar D. Su Z.Z. Randolph A. Boukerche H. Valerie K. Fisher P.B. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 1509-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Images were taken with a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM multiphoton 510 (Zeiss).Glutamate Uptake Assay—PHFA were plated in triplicate at 1 × 105 cells/well in 12-well plates, grown up to ∼75% confluence, and equilibrated at 25 °C in incubation medium, 0.125 m NaCl, 4.5 mm KCl, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm glucose, buffered to pH 7.4 with sodium phosphate. Assays to determine glutamate uptake were performed as described previously (15Wang Z. Pekarskaya O. Bencheikh M. Chao W. Gelbard H.A. Ghorpade A. Rothstein J.D. Volsky D.J.

The unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test was performed for statistical evaluations. p <0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSHuman EAAT2 Expression Is Induced by CEF in PHFA—To investigate whether CEF induces EAAT1 and EAAT2 expression in PHFA, the effect of CEF on EAAT1 and EAAT2 protein level was determined. As shown in Fig. 1A, treatment of PHFA with CEF significantly enhanced EAAT2 protein levels (∼3-fold). However, CEF had no effect on EAAT1 expression in PHFA (Fig. 1A), confirming previous data indicating that CEF did not regulate GLAST expression in the rat (20Rothstein J.D. Patel S. Regan M.R. Haenggeli C. Huang Y.H. Bergles D.E. Jin L. Dykes Hoberg M. Vidensky S. Chung D.S. Toan S.V. Bruijn L.I. Su Z.Z. Gupta P. Fisher P.B. Nature. 2005; 433: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). To determine whether CEF-mediated EAAT2 protein accumulation was associated with an increase in EAAT2-specific mRNA expression, total RNA from PHFA treated with or without CEF was isolated and examined by Northern blotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, EAAT2 mRNA was increased ∼3.5-fold in CEF-treated PHFA. This induction was caused by enhanced transcription (∼2.3-fold) as confirmed by performing nuclear run-on assays (Fig. 1C). These results confirm that human EAAT2 expression is induced by CEF at a transcriptional level in PHFA.CEF Activates the Human EAAT2 Promoter—To determine whether CEF activates the human EAAT2 promoter, an EAAT2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter vector (EAAT2Pro-954) was transiently transfected into PHFA cultured in antibiotic-free medium for at least 7 days. CEF treatment induced EAAT2 promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to ∼2.5-fold (Fig. 2A), documenting a significant transcriptional response of the EAAT2 promoter to this β-lactam antibiotic. We next determined in more detail the cis elements in the EAAT2 promoter essential for response to CEF. A series of 5′-deletion mutants of the EAAT2 promoter-reporter construct were transiently transfected into PHFA, and the transfected cells were treated with CEF (Fig. 2B). The basal promoter activity of each -490 and -202 deletion mutant significantly reduced in a similar pattern as reported previously, indicating that four NF-κB binding sites in the -616/-203 region of the EAAT2 promoter are important for the basal promoter activity (Fig. 2B) (19Su Z.Z.

Fisher P.B. Baldwin A.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, deletion from -490 to -203 resulted in a loss of CEF-induced promoter activity (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that transcription factors binding to the -490/-203 region are capable of regulating induction of the EAAT2 promoter in response to CEF.FIGURE 2CEF activates the EAAT2 promoter. A, PHFA cells were transfected with the EAAT2Pro-954 together with a pSV-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control. One day after transfection, cells were treated with various concentrations of CEF for 2 days as indicated. Values are presented as -fold-normalized activity relative to that of the untreated cells taken as 1.

Gupta P. Fisher P.B. Baldwin A.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we examined whether NF-κB is a basis of the CEF-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation by using NF-κB genetic and pharmacological inhibitors. The addition of NF-κB inhibitors Ad.IκBα-mt32, quinazoline, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and SN50 significantly inhibited CEF-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation with little change in basal EAAT2 promoter activity in PHFA (Fig. 3A). These results indicate that NF-κB is involved in CEF-mediated EAAT2 promoter activation.FIGURE 3NF-κB is crucial for CEF-induced EAAT2 expression. A, PHFA were infected with Ad.vec or Ad.IκBα-mt32. The infected cells (left) or uninfected PHFA (middle and right) were transfected with EAAT2Pro-954 together with pSV-β-galactosidase as an internal control. One day after transfection, cells were treated with 10 μm CEF together with the indicated inhibitors (middle, 5 μm quinalzoline or 20 μm pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate; right, 5 μm SN50M or SN50) for 2 days. Values are presented as –fold-normalized activity relative to that of the EAAT2Pro-954 in Ad.vec-infected (left), mock-treated (middle), or SN50M-treated (right) cells. B, PHFA were treated with 10 μm CEF for 4 days, and nuclear extracts were prepared. Nuclear extracts were mixed with each radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB binding site located at -583, -334, -272, or -251 of the EAAT2 promoter as follows: lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, untreated nuclear extracts; lanes 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10–13, CEF-treated nuclear extracts; lane 14, no extracts added. For competition assays, a 100-fold excess of corresponding unlabeled probe (lane 11) or unlabeled probe encompassing the mutated NF-κB site (lane 12) was added.

Recently, atmospheric new particle formation in the nanometer-size range has been found to be a global phenomenon. Still, its detailed mechanisms are mostly unknown, largely depending on the incapability to generate and measure nanoparticles in a controlled way. In our experiments, an organic vapor ( n -propanol) condenses on molecular ions, as well as on charged and uncharged inorganic nanoparticles, via initial activation by heterogeneous nucleation. We found a smooth transition in activation behavior as a function of size and activation to occur well before the onset of homogeneous nucleation. Furthermore, nucleation enhancement for charged particles and a substantial negative sign preference were quantitatively detected."

An increase in MEF2D (inhibitor) with a decline in MEF2A (activator) and MyoD (co-activator) binding to the glut4 promoter in IUGR versus control was observed. The functional role of MEF2/MyoD-binding sites and neighboring three CpG clusters in glut4 gene transcription was confirmed in C2C12 muscle cells. No differential methylation of these three and other CpG clusters in the glut4 promoter occurred. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in postnatal, DNMT3a, and DNMT3b in adult was differentially recruited with increased MeCP2 (methyl CpG-binding protein) concentrations to bind the IUGR glut4 gene. Covalent modifications of the histone (H) code consisted of H3.K14 de-acetylation by recruitment of histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and enhanced association of HDAC4 enzymes. This set the stage for Suv39H1 methylase-mediated di-methylation of H3.K9 and increased recruitment of heterochromatin protein 1α, which partially inactivates postnatal and adult IUGR glut4 gene transcription. Further increased interactions in the adult IUGR between DNMT3a/DNMT3b and HDAC1 and MEF2D and HDAC1/HDAC4 and decreased association between MyoD and MEF2A existed.

This process is mediated by a family of structurally related membrane-spanning glycoproteins, termed the facilitative glucose transporters (GLUT; Slc2 family of transport proteins) (8Baly D.L.

For gel shift-supershift experiments the more concentrated (2 μg/μl) form (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) of anti-MyoD, anti-MEF2A, anti-MEF2C, and anti-MEF2D antibodies was used.MethodsCells—C2C12 murine cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown at 37 °C with 95% air, 5% CO2 in poly-l-lysine-coated culture flasks and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, sodium pyruvate (110 mg/ml), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 units/ml), 4.5% glucose, and 10% fetal bovine serum.DNA Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Standard recombinant molecular biology techniques were used in cloning ∼1-kb rat glut4 upstream DNA sequences obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from 450-day female (control) rat skeletal muscle. Bidirectional cloning of the PCR amplification product obtained by using the Herculase hot start enzyme (Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA) was accomplished by ligating the KpnI- and HindIII-restricted glut4 DNA fragment to the pGL3 vector proximal to the contained firefly luciferase reporter gene (Promega Inc., Madison, WI). DNA sequences of the glut4-amplified product and its distal luciferase reporter gene were confirmed by DNA sequencing using specific primers. These sequences were aligned and compared with the rat, mouse, and human glut4 upstream sequences in GenBank™ using the ClustalW alignment search software (33Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55203) Google Scholar). Next, a search for transcription factor-binding sites that demonstrated high fidelity was performed using TRANSFAC 4.0 data base search (IMD = version 1.1, CBIL/GibbsMat = version 1.1, available on line) (34Fu Y. Weng Z. Genome Inform. 2005; 16: 68-72PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, the highly conserved MEF2- and MyoD-binding sites were delineated within the rat glut4 upstream sequences. In addition, using the CpG islander searcher software (35Takai D. Jones P.A. In Silico Biol. 2003; 2: 35-40Google Scholar), we identified multiple highly stringent CpG dinucleotide-enriched sequences in and around the proximal region of the glut4 promoter. These CpG dinucleotides in close proximity to the MEF2/MyoD-binding site were artificially grouped into three clusters, CpG-I, CpG-II, and CpG-III to facilitate analysis without disrupting the transcriptional binding sites. An additional eight CpG islands (numbered 21–28) 3′ to the MEF2/MyoD-binding site but 5′ to the transcription start site were also identified for analysis. Both primer-specific PCR-mediated (QuikChange mutagenesis kits, Stratagene) deletions and/or substitutions of target sequences were performed and confirmed by DNA sequence analyses. The primer sequences employed for DNA cloning and mutational analysis are shown in supplemental Table 1.Transient Transfection and Reporter Activity Assays—Transient transfection of cultured C2C12 cells was achieved by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2–4 μg of glut4-luciferase DNA constructs along with 0.5 μg of the β-galactosidase expressing plasmid were incubated with Lipofectamine 2000 at room temperature, in reduced serum containing Opti-MEM medium to facilitate DNA-liposome complex formation. After a 6–8-h incubation of the washed adherent cells with the DNA-liposome complex in either 6-well or 60-mm plates, fresh medium was added and incubation continued for varying durations. Following cell lysis, luciferase reporter activity was assessed in 20 μl of the cell extract that was mixed with 100 μl of the luciferase assay reagent, and firefly luciferase activity was measured as light output (10 s) by a standard luminometer (Monolight 2010, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego). To determine the transfection efficiency, β-galactosidase activity was also assayed by the luminometer according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). The glut4 promoter-driven luciferase enzyme activity was expressed as a ratio to the corresponding β-galactosidase activity per cellular protein concentrations (36Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).Effect of in Vitro Manipulations on Reporter Gene Activity—To methylate DNA in vitro, 10–20 μg of pglut4-Luc containing pGL3 plasmid DNA was treated with 10–20 units of SssI DNA methylase enzyme (New England Biolab, Ipswich, MA) for 6 h at 37 °C in a 20–50-μl volume and then purified in a quick column (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) after deactivation. The CpG-methylated reporter DNA was digested by HpaII and BstU1 and compared with the corresponding wild type DNA on agarose gel electrophoresis. To assess the effect of DNA methylation on glut4 promoter activity, the WT and modified glut4-luciferase DNA were transiently transfected into C2C12 cells, and luciferase reporter activity was assessed after 48 h (36Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27474-27483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).To inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes in general, 0, 0.3, and 0.6 μm trichostatin A (Upstate Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added to cultured cells for 12 h prior to assessing reporter luciferase enzyme activity. In addition, the effect of glucose and amino acid deprivation was examined in vitro by culturing C2C12 cells in starvation medium (Hanks' balanced salt solution with calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium pyruvate and dialyzed 10% fetal bovine serum) (Sigma). The cells were initially maintained in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter), l-glutamine, and sodium pyruvate along with 10% fetal bovine serum. Following overnight transfection in Opti-MEM media of the glut4 promoter-luciferase DNA construct, 50% glucose and amino acid content in culturing media was achieved for 24 h. The reporter luciferase gene activity was measured after cell lysis according to the manufacturer's protocol.Animals—Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Hollister, CA) were housed in individual cages, exposed to 12:12-h light-dark cycles at 21–23 °C, and allowed ad libitum access to standard rat chow. Animal care and use were approved by the Animal Research Committee at UCLA in accordance with the guidelines from the National Institutes of Health.Prenatal Semi-nutrient Restriction Model—Pregnant rats received 50% of their daily food intake (11 g/day) beginning from day 11 through day 21 of gestation, which constitutes mid- to late gestation, as compared with their control counterparts that received ad libitum access to rat chow (∼22g/day). Both groups had ad libitum access to drinking water (3Garg M. Thamotharan M. Rogers L. Bassilian S. Lee W.N.P. Devaskar S.U. Am. J.

Physiol. 2005; 288: E935-E947Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). At birth, the litter size was culled to six. The newborn rats born to semi-nutrient-restricted mothers were reared by the same mother that continued to be semi-nutrient restricted by receiving 20g/day food intake through lactation (IUGR) (3Garg M. Thamotharan M. Rogers L. Bassilian S. Lee W.N.P. Devaskar S.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: 1218-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Similarly, newborn pups born to control mothers were reared by the control mother with ad libitum access to rat chow (∼40g/day) (CON). This food restriction scheme ensured that the semi-nutrient restricted maternal rats received about ∼50% of the ad libitum food intake through mid- to late pregnancy and lactation (3Garg M. Thamotharan M. Rogers L. Bassilian S. Lee W.N.P. Devaskar S.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: 1218-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). At day 21, in both experimental groups, the pups were weaned from the mother and maintained in individual cages with ad libitum access to a similar diet of standard rat chow (3Garg M. Thamotharan M.

Devaskar S.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E935-E947Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar).Skeletal Muscle Preparation—Hind limb skeletal muscle was rapidly separated from surrounding tissues, quickly snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –70 °C as described previously (4Thamotharan M. Shin B.C. Suddirikku D.T. Thamotharan S. Garg M. Devaskar S.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E935-E947Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle was powdered under liquid nitrogen prior to use for varying extractions.Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). The extracted RNA (15 μg/lane) was subjected to Northern blot analysis as described previously (4Thamotharan M. Shin B.C. Suddirikku D.T. Thamotharan S. Garg M. Devaskar S.U. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 288: E935-E947Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A 32P-labeled 439-bp fragment of the rat glut4 cDNA served as the probe. The probe was prepared by amplifying rat glut4 cDNA containing the coding region spanning exons 4–7, with the forward primer 5′-ccggaattcctatgctggccaacaatgtc-3′ that primed rat glut4 cDNA at the beginning of exon 4 and the reverse primer 5′-cacacaagcttagtgcatcagacacatcagc-3′ that primed rat glut4 cDNA at the beginning of exon 7. PCR parameters for the glut4 cDNA amplification over 30 cycles consisted of 95 °C for 2 min initially, followed by denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 60 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s, and the last step consisting of 72 °C for 5 min. Inter-lane loading variability of Northern blots was standardized by re-hybridization of stripped filters with a 32P-labeled rat 589-bp fragment of the β-actin cDNA probe (37Nudel U. Zaket R. Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acid Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The rat β-actin probe was amplified with a forward primer 5′-acctgacagactacctcatg-3′ and a reverse primer 5′-taacagtccgcctagaagca-3′ with similar PCR conditions except for annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. In the case of insulin, pancreatic RNA was extracted and Northern blot analysis performed using similar conditions with a PCR-amplified rat I insulin probe (38Devaskar S.U. Giddings S.J.

Shani M. Neuman S. Levy Z. Yaffe D. Nucleic Acid Res. 1983; 11: 1759-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). The rat insulin I probe was amplified using the following primers: forward primer 5′-atagaccatcagcagcaagcagg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-tccagttgtggcacttgcg-3′ (GenBank™ accession number V01242) in PCR beginning at 94 °C for 5 min followed by denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min over 35 cycles followed by 72 °C for 5 min. The insulin I probe was digoxigenin-labeled (Roche Diagnostics) and used with 15 μg of RNA/lane loading. The signals on blots were quantified with a Variable Mode Imager (Typhoon 9410, Amersham Biosciences). The results were expressed as a ratio between glut4 and β-actin mRNA or insulin and β-actin PhosphorImager values.Electromobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—The 1-kb upstream glut4 wild type and mutant clones carrying deletions of MyoD-I, MyoD-II, and MEF2 binding domains were amplified by PCR. Primers encompassing MyoD-I-, MyoD-II-, and MEF2-binding sites individually were employed to produce ∼100-bp size DNA fragments carrying either only one binding site each or a deleted binding site that was then end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase. The primers used for amplifying the wild type and mutated probes are listed in supplemental Table 2. Approximately 6 fmol (specific activity = 3000 Ci/mmol) of the labeled DNA probe was added to 5 μg of skeletal muscle nuclear extract in a final volume of 20 μl containing 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the DNA-protein complexes were separated from unbound DNA by electrophoresis through a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in a 90 mm Tris borate, 2 mm EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography (39Rajakumar R.A. Thamotharan S. Raychaudhuri N. Menon R.K. Devaskar S.U. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26768-26779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Competition occurred in the presence of 10–100-fold excess of unlabeled DNA oligonucleotides. In electrophoretic mobility super-shift assays, 2 μg of the respective antibody (IgG) was included in the reaction mix and incubated for 30 min. DNA target sequences (oligonucleotides) used in gel shift reactions are listed in supplemental Table 3.DNA Bisulfite Modification Assay—Genomic DNA was extracted from 450-day female CON and IUGR and 2-day male and female CON and IUGR skeletal muscle using the DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The extracted DNA was subjected to bisulfite modification using the CpGenome fast DNA modification kit (Chemicon International Inc., Temecula, CA). The bisulfite-modified naked DNA served as the template in a PCR where specific regions containing the CpG-I, CpG-II, and CpG-III islands and other 3′-CpG-rich regions of the upstream glut4 promoter 5′ to the transcription start site were amplified with primers created by the MethPrimer software (40Pattyn F.

https://openalex.org/W2004779826,"Orai1 and TRPC1 have been proposed as core components of store-operated calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) and store-operated calcium (SOC) channels, respectively. STIM1, a Ca2+ sensor protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, interacts with and mediates store-dependent regulation of both channels. We have previously reported that dynamic association of Orai1, TRPC1, and STIM1 is involved in activation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in salivary gland cells. In this study, we have assessed the molecular basis of TRPC1-SOC channels in HEK293 cells. We report that TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOCE requires functional Orai1. Thapsigargin stimulation of cells expressing Orai1+STIM1 increased Ca2+ entry and activated typical ICRAC current. STIM1 alone did not affect SOCE, whereas expression of Orai1 induced a decrease. Expression of TRPC1 induced a small increase in SOCE, which was greatly enhanced by co-expression of STIM1. Thapsigargin stimulation of cells expressing TRPC1+STIM1 activated a non-selective cation current, ISOC, that was blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ and 2-APB. Knockdown of Orai1 decreased endogenous SOCE as well as SOCE with TRPC1 alone. siOrai1 also significantly reduced SOCE and ISOC in cells expressing TRPC1+STIM1. Expression of R91WOrai1 or E106QOrai1 induced similar attenuation of TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOCE and ISOC, whereas expression of Orai1 with TRPC1+STIM1 resulted in SOCE that was larger than that with Orai1+STIM1 or TRPC1+STIM1 but not additive. Additionally, Orai1, E106QOrai1, and R91WOrai1 co-immunoprecipitated with similar levels of TRPC1 and STIM1 from HEK293 cells, and endogenous TRPC1, STIM1, and Orai1 were co-immunoprecipitated from salivary glands. Together, these data demonstrate a functional requirement for Orai1 in TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOCE.

Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2106) Google Scholar). Neither the mechanism by which the status of Ca2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum is transmitted to the plasma membrane nor the molecular components of the channels have yet been conclusively identified in all cell types. Several reports suggest a diversity in store-operated Ca2+ channels in different cell types (2Beech D.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J.

For example, calcium release-activated calcium (CRAC) channel, which is found in T-lymphocytes, RBL, and other hematopoietic cells, is a highly Ca2+-selective channel with unique properties (4Parekh A.B.

Chem. 2006; 281: 20661-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Further, mutations in the conserved negatively charged residues of Orai1 alter the Ca2+ selectivity of CRAC channel (27Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Nature. 2006; 443: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 28Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Safrina O. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2006; 443: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that Orai1 and STIM1 are sufficient for the formation of CRAC channel and that Orai1 is the pore-forming unit. The contribution of Orai proteins to SOCE in all cell types is not yet clear. Not all cells that express Orai proteins demonstrate CRAC currents (24Wissenbach U. Philipp S.E. Gross S.A. Cavalie A. Flockerzi V. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 29DeHaven W.I. Smyth J.T. Boyles R.R. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

A recent report demonstrated that Orai1 does not form the CRAC channel in mouse T-lymphocytes (31Vig M. Dehaven W.I. Bird G.S. Billingsley J.M. Wang H. Rao P.E. Hutchings A.B. Jouvin M.H. Putney J.W. Kinet J.P. Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 89-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that Orai and STIM proteins might serve multiple functions and display very different biophysical properties in different cell types depending on the molecular composition of the channel complexes. Orai channel complexes might consist of not only different Orais and STIMs but also other channel subunits (24Wissenbach U. Philipp S.E. Gross S.A. Cavalie A. Flockerzi V. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The possibility of Orai1 being associated with a larger protein complex was also suggested (32Varnai P. Toth B. Toth D.J. Hunyady L. Balla T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29678-29690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that dynamic assembly of a TRPC1-STIM1-Orai1 complex is involved in SOCE in salivary gland cells (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J.

We have shown that endogenous Orai1, STIM1, and TRPC1 concertedly regulate SOCE in these cells. Although heterologous expression of TRPC1 alone does not increase SOCE, co-expression with STIM1 was reported to increase SOCE and SOC channel function in HEK293 cells (33Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 34Yuan J.P. Zeng W. Huang G.N. Worley P.F. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Further, a suggestion has been made that Orai1 might function as a regulator of TRPC3 and TRPC6, conferring store-dependent activation of these channels (35Liao Y. Erxleben C. Yildirim E. Abramowitz J. Armstrong D.L. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4682-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the molecular basis of TRPC1-dependent SOC channels. We report that in addition to STIM1, there is a functional requirement for Orai1 in the generation of TRPC1-SOC channels. HEK293 Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin G and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were allowed to grow to ∼70% confluence and transfected with required DNA at concentration of 1 μg/ml, using Lipofectamine 2000 and protocols supplied by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Knockdown experiments were carried out by transfection of Orai1 siRNA (sequence number ucacugguuagccauaaga) or control siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL), transfected at a concentration of 0.8 nmol/ml, using DharmaFECT Duo reagent and protocols supplied by the manufacturer. Electrophysiology—Coverslips with HEK cells were transferred to the recording chamber and perfused with an standard external solution with the following composition (in mm): NaCl, 145; KCl, 5; MgCl2, 1; CaCl2, 1; Hepes, 10; glucose, 10; pH 7.4 (NaOH). The patch pipette had resistances between 3 and 5 milliohms after filling with the standard intracellular solution that contained the following (in mm): cesium methane sulfonate, 145; NaCl, 8; MgCl2, 10; Hepes, 10; EGTA, 10; pH 7.2 (CsOH). Osmolarity for all the solutions was adjusted with mannose to 300 ± 5 mosm using a vapor pressure Osmometer (Wescor, Logan, UT). Whole cell patch clamp experiments were performed in the standard whole cell configuration at room temperature (22Williams R.T. Senior P.V. Van Stekelenburg L. Layton J.E. Smith P.J.

Generation of the current was assessed by the amplitude at –80 mV, taken from the currents recorded during voltage ramps ranging from –90 to 90 mV over a period of 1 s imposed every 4 s (holding potential was 0 mV) and digitized at a rate of 1 kHz. Liquid-junction potentials were less than 8 mV and were not corrected. Capacitative currents and series resistance were determined and minimized. For analysis, current recorded during the first ramp was used for leak subtraction of the subsequent current records. [Ca2+]i Measurements—Fura2 fluorescence was measured in single HEK cells cultured for 24–48 h in glass bottom MatTek tissue culture dishes (MatTek Corp. Ashland, MA) and transfected as required. Fluorescence was recorded in Fura2-loaded cells using a Till Photonics-Polychrome V spectrofluorimeter and MetaFluor imaging software (Molecular Devices). Student's t test was used to statistically evaluate the data. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Crude membrane fraction was prepared from cells as described previously (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T.

Anti-STIM1 (BD Biosciences), anti-Orai1 (Alomone Labs), and anti-TRPC1 (Sigma), or as described earlier (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y.

Expression of Orai1+STIM1 Increases SOCE and Generates ICRAC—Fig. 1, panel i, shows that expression of Orai1 and STIM1 in HEK293 cells induces a significant increase in thapsigargin (Tg)-stimulated SOCE (Fig. 1, panel ii). Expression of STIM1 alone did not induce any change in SOCE, whereas expression of Orai1 induced a slight inhibition of SOCE (data not shown). Expression of Orai1+STIM1 resulted in activation of typical inwardly rectifying ICRAC-like currents in response to Tg stimulation of cells (Fig. 1, panels iii and iv) as has been previously reported (25Peinelt C. Vig M. Koomoa D.L. Beck A. Nadler M.J. Koblan-Huberson M. Lis A. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 26Soboloff J.

TRPC1-dependent SOCE Is Dependent on STIM1 and Orai1 in HEK293 Cells—Although co-expression of Orai1 and STIM1 in HEK293 cells is reported to generate the CRAC channel (5Lewis R.S. Nature. 2007; 446: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), expression of TRPC channels with STIM1 has been shown to generate SOC channels in these cells (33Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 34Yuan J.P. Zeng W. Huang G.N. Worley P.F. Muallem S. Nat.

A. 2007; 104: 4682-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). How exactly these two distinct channels are assembled and whether any endogenous proteins are involved in the process is not yet known. Fig. 1, panel v (see panel viii for average data), shows that siOrai1 induced 80% decrease in endogenous SOCE (transfection with control siRNA did not affect SOCE when compared with non-transfected cells, trace not shown). siSTIM1 also significantly reduced SOCE (data not shown). The decrease in endogenous Orai1 by siOrai1 is shown in the inset (lane 1 shows Orai1 in cells treated for 48 h with control siRNA, and lanes 2, 3, and 4 show the protein after 48 h of treatment with 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 nmol of siOrai1, respectively. Actin expression in the samples is shown as a control. Note that 0.8 nmol of siOrai1 was used in the experiments described here). Overexpression of TRPC1 induced a 1.75-fold increase in SOCE (Fig. 1, panel vi), whereas overexpression of TRPC1+STIM1 induced 2.4-fold increase in SOCE relative to that in control cells (Fig. 1, panel vii). Ca2+ entry in these cells was blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ as well as by 20 μm 2-APB (supplemental Fig. 1), showing that TRPC1+STIM1 primarily result in SOCE. Importantly, knockdown of endogenous Orai1 attenuated TRPC1- or TRPC1+STIM1-induced SOCE by >50% (i.e. the increase in 340/380 ratio in TRPC1+STIM1 cells is about 0.7, whereas that in siOrai1+TRPC1+STIM1-expressing cells is 0.35. Note that these values represent the increase in 340/380 ratio above that in control cells following Ca2+ readdition to cells, i.e. due to Ca2+ entry). Thus, knockdown of endogenous Orai1 decreased STIM1-dependent increase in SOCE in TRPC1-expressing cells (SOCE in TRPC1+STIM1 cells was 1.2 when compared with 0.7 in cells expressing TRPC1 alone, i.e. the increase due to STIM1 is 0.5. With expression of siOrai1 in both sets of cells, this increase was attenuated to 0.2, a 60% decrease, Fig. 1, panel vii). Thus, endogenous Orai1 is required for exogenously expressed TRPC1 and STIM1 to increase SOCE. The data also show that the increase in TRPC1 function conferred by STIM1 is dependent on endogenous Orai1. The contributions of TRPC1, STIM1, and Orai1 in SOCE were further examined by measuring store-operated currents. In contrast to the current seen with Orai1+STIM1 (Fig. 1, panels iii and iv), cells expressing TRPC1+STIM1 displayed linear currents following Tg stimulation, which could be blocked by 20 μm 2-APB (Fig. 1, panel ix and x, similar inhibition was seen with 1 μm Gd3+, data not shown). Note that about 40% of the cells displayed spontaneous currents, which in some cells could be further increased with Tg. In both cases, the current was fully blocked by 1 μm Gd3+ (supplemental Fig. 1). Together, these data demonstrate that TRPC1+STIM1 generate SOC channels that are distinct from CRAC channels in the property of their currents. The characteristics of TRPC1+STIM1 channels in these cells are similar to those described by Yuan et al. (34Yuan J.P. Zeng W. Huang G.N. Worley P.F. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Importantly, TRPC1+STIM1-induced ISOC was significantly reduced by knockdown of endogenous Orai1 (Fig. 1, panels xi and xii, and see Fig. 2, panel x, for average data). Thus, TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOC channel function also requires endogenous Orai1. Together, the data shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that TRPC1 requires overexpression of STIM1 to generate SOC channels in HEK293 cells. This most likely explains why in previous studies there was no increase in function associated with TRPC1 overexpression in these cells (4Parekh A.B. Putney Jr., J.W. Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 757-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). A novel finding of the present study is that the ability of TRPC1 and STIM1 to increase SOCE and generate SOC channels is dependent on endogenous Orai1. We detected a small contribution of TRPC1 to endogenous SOCE in HEK293 cells, and shTRPC1 induced an ∼20% decrease. However, shTRPC1 did not affect Orai1+STIM1-dependent increase in SOCE and ICRAC (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, we have previously shown that endogenous TRPC1 does not contribute to ICRAC in RBL-293 cells (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Singh B.B. Gill D.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9105-9116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have also suggested lack of a role for TRPC1 in Orai1+STIM1-generated CRAC channels in HEK293 cells (25Peinelt C. Vig M. Koomoa D.L. Beck A. Nadler M.J. Koblan-Huberson M. Lis A. Fleig A. Penner R. Kinet J.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 771-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 26Soboloff J. Spassova M.A. Tang X.D. Hewavitharana T. Xu W. Gill D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20661-20665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Thus, the molecular requirement for generation of Orai1+STIM1-CRAC channels appears to be different from those of TRPC1+STIM1-SOC channels in this cell type. We have previously demonstrated an association between TRPC1-STIM1-Orai1 in human submandibular gland (HSG) cells. The present data would suggest that exogenously expressed STIM1 and TRPC1 associate with endogenous Orai1 to form a functional SOC channel in HEK293 cells. Unfortunately, the latter observation could not be determined biochemically due to the lack of an appropriate Orai1 antibody. Functional Orai1 Is Required for TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOCE—Severe loss of ICRAC in T-lymphocytes isolated from SCID patients has been linked to a mutation (R91W) near the first TM domain of Orai1. The mutant channel has been shown to be inactive (20Feske S. Gwack Y. Prakriya M. Srikanth S. Puppel S.H. Tanasa B. Hogan P.G. Lewis R.S. Daly M. Rao A. Nature. 2006; 441: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1846) Google Scholar). Although exactly why this mutant is not functional is not yet understood, it is interesting that a conserved sequence in the N terminus of Orai1, amino acids 74–90 immediately upstream of the mutation site, has been suggested to be involved in activation of the channel (36Li Z. Lu J. Xu P. Xie X. Chen L. Xu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29448-29456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Expression of R91WOrai1 in HEK293 cells induced a decrease in endogenous SOCE (Fig. 2, panel ii, trace not shown). Expression of TRPC1+STIM1 in cells expressing R91WOrai1 resulted in SOCE similar to that seen in cells expressing TRPC1+STIM1+siOrai1 (Fig. 2, panel i and ii, compare with Fig. 1, vii and viii). Similar inhibition of endogenous SOCE (trace not shown, Fig. 2, panel ii) as well as SOCE in TRPC1+STIM1-expressing cells was seen by expression of E106QOrai1 (Fig. 2, panels i and ii). This mutant of Orai1 has decreased ion permeability and has been shown to exert dominant suppression of endogenous SOCE as well as Orai1+STIM1-dependent SOCE in HEK293 cells (27Prakriya M. Feske S. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Nature. 2006; 443: 230-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar, 28Yeromin A.V. Zhang S.L. Jiang W. Yu Y. Safrina O. Cahalan M.D. Nature. 2006; 443: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In contrast, expression of Orai1 together with TRPC1+STIM1 induced SOCE that was larger than that seen with TRPC1+STIM1 or Orai1+STIM1, but not additive (increase was calculated relative to SOCE in control cells, Fig. 2i, average data shown in panel ii). Expression of TRPC1+Orai1 without STIM1 did not change SOCE (data not shown). Fig. 2, panel iii, shows that R91WOrai1, E106QOrai1, and Orai1 (all FLAG-tagged) were expressed at similar levels and co-immunoprecipitated with comparable levels of STIM1 as well as TRPC1 (note that none of the proteins were immunoprecipitated in control IPs using anti-FLAG antibody and lysates of non-transfected HEK cells, supplemental Fig. 2). Thus, the functional differences seen in cells expressing the wild type and mutant proteins are not due to differences in their expression levels or their ability to associate with STIM1 or TRPC1. Further, IP of TRPC1 pulls down similar level of STIM1 in cells where Orai1 was not overexpressed (data not shown), indicating that there is no disruption of STIM1-TRPC1 association by expression of Orai1 (also see Ref. 19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Singh B.B. Gill D.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9105-9116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The association between the three proteins was also observed in submandibular gland cells. IP of endogenous TRPC1 co-immunoprecipitated endogenous Orai1 and STIM1 (Fig. 2, panel iii, right blot). These data provide strong evidence that there is close association between TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1. The requirement of functional Orai1 was assessed by using functionally deficient Orai1 mutants. Co-expression of R91WOrai1 (the mutant in SCID patients) or E106QOrai1 (the pore-deficient mutant) with TRPC1+STIM1 induced >70% inhibition of ISOC (Fig. 2, panels vi to ix, respectively, also see Fig. 2, panel x, for average data). Since siOrai1 also induces similar attenuation of TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOC channel activity, it is unlikely that competition for STIM1 accounts for the observed attenuating effect of the mutant Orai1 proteins on TRPC1+STIM1-SOC function. In contrast, co-expression of Orai1 with TRPC1+STIM1 (Fig. 2, panel iv and v) induced non-selective linear current in 8/11 cells, which was 30% larger in amplitude than that seen with TRPC1+STIM1 or Orai1+STIM1 (Fig. 2, panels iv, v, and x). In 3/11 cells, the currents were weakly inwardly rectifying but relatively non-selective, i.e. more like ISOC. Note that when Orai1-cDNA was used during transfection was increased (5 μg instead of 1 μg), 3/7 cells displayed linear non-selective currents, 2/7 displayed ISOC-like currents with right shift in the Erev, and 2/7 displayed ICRAC-like currents (data not shown). The data reported above demonstrate that co-expression of STIM1 with TRPC1 is required for generation of SOC channels in HEK293 cells. This is similar to the STIM1 requirement reported for the generation of CRAC channels in HEK293 cells by exogenous expression of Orai1 (5Lewis R.S. Nature. 2007; 446: 284-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Further, we show that TRPC1+STIM1 generate channels that display characteristics that are distinct from Orai1+STIM1-generated CRAC channels. These data are consistent with previous studies describing TRPC+STIM1-dependent SOC channel activity in HEK293 cells (33Huang G.N. Zeng W. Kim J.Y. Yuan J.P. Han L. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1003-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar, 34Yuan J.P. Zeng W. Huang G.N. Worley P.F. Muallem S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 636-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Together, these data also account for the previously reported lack of effect of heterologously expressed TRPC1 on SOCE. An important and novel finding of the present study is that endogenous Orai1 is required for TRPC1+STIM1-generated SOC channel function. Further, non-functional Orai1 mutant, R91WOrai1, or the permeability-defective mutant, E106QOrai1, attenuate the function of TRPC1+STIM1-SOC channels, whereas Orai1 increases TRPC1+STIM1-dependent SOCE. Although we do not yet understand how exactly Orai1 contributes to TRPC1+STIM1 channel function, possible mechanisms that can be proposed are: (i) TRPC1 and Orai1 contribute to the same channel, (ii) Orai1 and TRPC1 form distinct channels, whereby the function of Orai1 somehow regulates TRPC1, and (iii) TRPC1 and Orai1 form distinct and independent channels. Although the present data do not exclude the first two possibilities, several of our observations, described here and previously (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Singh B.B. Gill D.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9105-9116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), suggest that when co-expressed, TRPC1 and Orai1 do not form distinct and independent channels. First, increase in the current as well as Ca2+ entry obtained in cells expressing Orai1+STIM1+TRPC1 (increase in 340/380 ratio above control = 0.9) is less than that expected if Orai1+STIM1 and TRPC1+STIM1 generated separate channels (together the increase in 340/380 ratio should be 1.4). We do not believe that this is due to a competition between TRPC1 and Orai1 for STIM1 since transfection with different amounts of STIM1 cDNA gave similar results (data not shown). Also, co-IP of exogenously expressed TRPC1 and STIM1 was not affected by co-expression of Orai1 (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Singh B.B. Gill D.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9105-9116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Finally, siOrai1 did not increase TRPC1+STIM1-mediated SOCE as would be expected if Orai1 were competing for a limited pool of STIM1. Although more studies are required to determine the precise functional association between TRPC1 and Orai1, based on our data, we propose that the proteins converge on the same SOC channel. Orai1 has been shown to contribute to the ion permeability of CRAC channel, which has been reported to be independent of TRPC1 and other TRPC proteins. However, a recent study showed that several neuronal cells express Orai proteins but do not display ICRAC (24Wissenbach U. Philipp S.E. Gross S.A. Cavalie A. Flockerzi V. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 439-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and it was suggested that Orai proteins might interact with each other or with other proteins to form diverse SOC channels. An interesting role for Orai1 proposed by Liao et al. (35Liao Y. Erxleben C. Yildirim E. Abramowitz J. Armstrong D.L. Birnbaumer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 4682-4687Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) was that it serves as a regulatory subunit for TRPC3 and TRPC6 channels and confers coupling to the store by mediating the regulation by STIM1. Our previous study suggested a possible association between Orai1 and TRPC1 in cells expressing SOC channels (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Singh B.B. Gill D.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9105-9116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Here we have shown that functional Orai1 is required for generation of TRPC1-SOC channel. These data do not exclude the possibility that Orai1 and TRPC1 form the same SOC channel, although how this is achieved will need to be addressed in future studies. Alternatively, Orai1-CRAC channels might somehow regulate TRPC1-SOC channels. Although the exact contribution of Orai1 in TRPC1-dependent SOC channel function has yet to be determined, we have shown above that the three proteins are closely associated endogenously in salivary glands where TRPC1 has a major role in SOCE (19Ong H.L. Cheng K.T. Liu X. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Paria B.C. Soboloff J. Pani B. Gwack Y. Srikanth S. Singh B.B. Gill D.L. Ambudkar I.S. J. Biol.

In conclusion, store-operated Ca2+ entry appears to be mediated via distinct channels in different cell types. Although some channels are Orai+STIM-based, others depend on TRPC+STIM. We recently reported that TRPC1–/– salivary gland cells had greatly reduced SOCE and ISOC, which was asscoiated with a significant and stable loss of fluid secretion, although all three Orai transcripts were detected in TRPC1–/– cells (37Liu X. Cheng K.T. Bandyopadhyay B.C. Pani B. Dietrich A. Paria B.C. Swaim W.D. Beech D. Yildrim E. Singh B.B. Birnbaumer L. Ambudkar I.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 17542-17547Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, the Orai proteins were unable to compensate for the loss of TRPC1. Here we show that TRPC1 generates SOC channels in a STIM1-dependent manner and that these channels are distinct from CRAC channels. Importantly, our data demonstrate a novel functional requirement for Orai1 in TRPC1-generated SOC channel. Thus, STIM1 and Orai1 appear to be required for the generation of CRAC as well as SOC channels. Although Orai1+STIM1 appear to be sufficient for CRAC channels, TRPC1, Orai1, and STIM1 concertedly generate SOC channels. Further studies are required to determine the exact molecular interactions between these proteins that determine SOCE.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antifibrotic potential of dasatinib and nilotinib, 2 novel inhibitors of c-abl and PDGF, which are well tolerated and have recently been approved. Dasatinib and nilotinib dose-dependently reduced the mRNA and protein levels of extracellular matrix proteins in human stimulated dermal fibroblasts from SSc patients (IC(50) of 0.5-2.0 nM for dasatinib and 0.8-2.5 nM for nilotinib). In a mouse model of bleomycin-induced dermal fibrosis, dasatinib and nilotinib potently reduced the dermal thickness, the number of myofibroblasts, and the collagen content of the skin in a dose-dependent manner at well-tolerated doses. These data indicate that dasatinib and nilotinib potently inhibit the synthesis of extracellular matrix in vitro and in vivo at biologically relevant concentrations. Thus, we provide the first evidence that dasatinib and nilotinib might be promising drugs for the treatment of patients with SSc."

Here, we report the approximately 3 angstrom resolution structure of a GAS M1 fragment containing the regions responsible for eliciting type-specific, protective immunity and for binding fibrinogen, which promotes M1 proinflammatory and antiphagocytic functions. The structure revealed substantial irregularities and instabilities throughout the coiled coil of the M1 fragment. Similar structural irregularities occur in myosin and tropomyosin, explaining the patterns of cross-reactivity seen in autoimmune sequelae of GAS infection. Sequence idealization of a large segment of the M1 coiled coil enhanced stability but diminished fibrinogen binding, proinflammatory effects, and antibody cross-reactivity, whereas it left protective immunogenicity undiminished. Idealized M proteins appear to have promise as vaccine immunogens."

Gram-negative sepsis is a persistent and widespread problem, with up to 300,000 cases occurring each year in the United States alone (1Martin G.S. Mannino D.M. Eaton S. Moss M. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 1546-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (4871) Google Scholar). Despite the development of new antibiotics, mortality from Gram-negative sepsis remains unacceptably high (2Bone R.C. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 6: 57-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Life-threatening Gram-negative sepsis can be complicated by systemic vascular collapse, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and vascular leak syndromes, including the acute respiratory distress syndrome (3Ulevitch R.J.

One common element to these sepsis-associated vascular complications is the presence of endothelial cell (EC) 3The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; SFK, SRC family PTK; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; ZA, zonula adherens; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HMVEC-L, human lung microvascular endothelial cell; RT, reverse transcription; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; IL, interleukin. injury and/or dysfunction. Evidence exists that the bacterial component responsible for much of these EC alterations is the bacterial outer membrane constituent, endotoxin or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS bioactivity has been detected in the bloodstream of Gram-negative septicemic patients, and levels of circulating LPS predict development of multiorgan failure, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (5Brandtzaeg P.

Finally, immunological and pharmacological interventions that specifically target the LPS molecule, at least in some reports, protect against these same vascular complications (6Bannerman D.D.

Physiol. 1997; 273: L217-L226PubMed Google Scholar). TLR4 (Toll-like receptor 4) is the principal signal-transducing receptor for LPS (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Van Huffel C. Du X.

Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Ogawa T. Takeda Y. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 3749-3752Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling elements downstream to TLR4 have been thoroughly studied in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage that express TLR4 and CD14 on the cell surface (12Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y.

Although it is well known that LPS elicits a wide range of host cell responses, reports on downstream TLR4 signaling have almost exclusively focused on proinflammatory gene expression. Whether these findings can be extended either to other cell types, including ECs, and/or to other biological activities, including tyrosine phosphorylation events and barrier disruption, is less clear. In ECs, LPS responsiveness is less well understood. First, there is no agreement as to whether EC TLR4 is expressed within the cell or on the cell surface (14Andreakos E. Sacre S.M. Smith C.

In other reports, however, TLR4 was not detectable on either HMEC-1 cells (18Spitzer J.H. Visintin A. Mazzoni A. Kennedy M.N. Segal D.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) or human umbilical vein ECs (19Dunzendorfer S. Lee H.K. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 1166-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) by surface staining using these same anti-TLR4 antibodies. In the latter report, anti-TLR4 antibodies, at concentrations that far exceeded those that blocked LPS responsiveness in macrophages, failed to block the human umbilical vein EC response to LPS (14Andreakos E.

In another report in which flow cytometry was applied to human coronary artery ECs, five distinct anti-TLR4 antibodies failed to detect surface TLR4, and these same antibodies could not block LPS-induced EC expression of CD62E (E-selectin) (15Dunzendorfer S. Lee H.K. Soldau K. Tobias P.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1117-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).

In multiple studies, ECs did not express CD14 (22Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Bazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1991; 147: 3761-3767PubMed Google Scholar). In one recent report, early passage human umbilical vein ECs were found to synthesize and express low levels of CD14 on the cell surface (2000-3000 molecules/cell) that rapidly diminished with subsequent passage (24Jersmann H.P. Hii C.S. Hodge G.L. Ferrante A. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In another report, anti-CD14 antibodies, in the absence of serum, reduced the EC response to LPS (25von Asmuth E.J. Dentener M.A. Bazil V. Bouma M.G. Leeuwenberg J.F. Buurman W.A. Immunology. 1993; 80: 78-83PubMed Google Scholar). These inconsistent findings for TLR4 and CD14 expression in ECs have made the molecular mechanisms for LPS responsiveness in these cells more difficult to define. In a bovine EC system, we have found that LPS increases tyrosine phosphorylation of EC proteins enriched to EC-EC boundaries, reorganizes the actin cytoskeleton, and opens the paracellular pathway, all in a PTK-dependent manner (11Bannerman D.D.

Changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of one or more ZA proteins alter protein-protein interactions within the multiprotein complex that promote actin depolymerization, ZA disassembly, and/or disruption of the ZA-actin cytoskeletal linkage (10Angelini D.J.

Through inside-out signaling, homophilic adhesion between opposing VE-cadherin ectodomains is thus reduced, and the endothelial paracellular pathway opens. In this study, we have identified specific LPS-inducible PTK(s) that participate in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of EC substrates, including ZA proteins, leading to opening of the paracellular pathway in human lung microvascular endothelia. Reagents—Protein-free Escherichia coli K235 LPS (<0.008% protein) was prepared by modification of the phenol/water extraction method to exclude contaminating bacterial constituents present in commercial LPS preparations (42McIntire F.C. Sievert H.W. Barlow G.H. Finley R.A. Lee A.Y. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2363-2372Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The broad spectrum PTK inhibitors, herbimycin A and geldanamycin, and the SFK inhibitors, PP2 and Su6656, were purchased from Calbiochem. LPS derived from E. coli O111:B4 and [14C]bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma. EC Culture—Human lung microvascular ECs (HMVEC-Ls) and, in selective experiments, human pulmonary artery ECs (Cambrex, San Diego, CA) were cultured in EC growth medium (EBM-2; Cambrex) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, human recombinant epidermal growth factor, human recombinant insulin-like growth factor-1, human basic fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, gentamicin, and amphotericin B (10Angelini D.J.

Only ECs at passages 5-10 were studied. Trypan blue exclusion was used to assess EC plasma membrane integrity or viability. Assay of Transendothelial Albumin Flux—Transendothelial BSA flux was assayed as previously described (6Bannerman D.D. Fitzpatrick M.J. Anderson D.Y. Bhattacharjee A.K. Novitsky T.J. Hasday J.D. Cross A.S. Goldblum S.E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1400-1407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, gelatin-impregnated polycarbonate filters (13-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size) (Nucleopore, Pleasanton, CA) mounted in polystyrene chemotactic chambers (ADAPS, Dedham, MA) were inserted into wells of 24-well plates. ECs (2 × 105 cells/chamber) were seeded in each upper compartment and cultured for 72 h. The base-line barrier function of each monolayer was established by introducing an equivalent concentration of the permeability tracer, [14C]BSA (1.1 pmol (i.e. 4800-6200 dpm/0.5 ml)) to each upper compartment for 1 h, after which 0.5 ml from the lower compartment was mixed with 4.5 ml of Optifluor scintillation fluid (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL) and counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Only those monolayers retaining ≥97% of the tracer were utilized in experiments. The monolayers were then exposed to increasing concentrations of protein-free LPS, Pam3Cys (L2000; EMC Microcollections, Tuebingen, Germany), or medium alone for increasing exposure times in the presence or absence of PTK inhibitors, after which transendothelial [14C]BSA flux was again assayed. Expression of SFKs and TLR4 in HMVEC-Ls—Total RNA was isolated from HMVEC-Ls with the Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). A human SRC family kinase MultiGene-12™ RT-PCR profiling kit (SuperArray, Frederick, MD) was used to detect mRNA for the eight human SFK members. Primers used to detect TLR4 mRNA by RT-PCR were 5′-CGGATGGCAACATTTAGAATTAGT-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGATTGAGACTGTAATCAAGAACC-3′ (reverse). To assess expression at the protein level, total HMVEC-L lysates were resolved by 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred onto polyvinyldene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The blots were probed with murine monoclonal antibodies raised against c-SRC, LYN (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), and YES (BD Biosciences), rabbit polyclonal anti-FYN antibodies, or murine monoclonal antibodies raised against TLR4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody or goat anti-rabbit antibody (BD Biosciences) and developed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences). In other experiments, HMVEC-Ls were detached using 0.25% trypsin-EDTA, in some cases permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated mouse anti-human TLR4 antibodies (BD Biosciences) or a FITC-conjugated species- and isotype-matched control antibody for 30 min at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline. Antibody binding to the intact and permeabilized cells was evaluated using a flow cytometer (FACSCAN; BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed with CELLQUEST software (BD Biosciences). Phosphotyrosine Immunolocalization—Postconfluent ECs were exposed for 1 h to LPS (100 ng/ml) or medium alone. The ECs were fixed (4% paraformaldehyde, 10 min), washed, permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100, 5 min), blocked, and incubated for 1.5 h with FITC-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10; Millipore) in the dark. The ECs were mounted on microscope slides, visualized, and photographed through a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-E). Phosphotyrosine Immunoblotting—Postconfluent ECs (2.3 × 105 cells/100-mm dish) were exposed to LPS or medium alone, after which they were lysed with ice-cold modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mg/ml type-1 DNase, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mm pyrophosphate, and 1 mm phenylarsine oxide (all purchased from Sigma), and 1 tablet of complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 20 ml of lysate as described (10Angelini D.J. Hyun S.W. Grigoryev D.N. Garg P. Gong P. Singh I.S. Passaniti A. Hasday J.D. Goldblum S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: L1232-L1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged, and the supernatants were assayed for protein concentration with a Bradford protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The samples were resolved by 4-12% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membranes. The blots were blocked with membrane blocking solution (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and were incubated with mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (PY-Plus mixture) (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (BD Biosciences), and developed with ECL. To confirm equivalent protein loading and transfer, blots were stripped with the Blot Restore membrane rejuvenation kit (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), reprobed with mouse anti-β-tubulin antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), and again developed with ECL as described (10Angelini D.J. Hyun S.W. Grigoryev D.N. Garg P. Gong P. Singh I.S. Passaniti A. Hasday J.D. Goldblum S.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: L1232-L1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Identification of Phosphotyrosine-containing Proteins—An immunoprecipitation strategy was employed to identify ZA substrates for LPS-induced tyrosine phosphorylation as described (43Sui X.F.

Lysates of ECs treated with LPS or medium alone were precleared by incubation with either anti-murine or anti-rabbit IgG cross-linked to agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with specific murine monoclonal antibodies raised against β-, γ-, or p120-catenin (BD Biosciences) or a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against VE-cadherin (Cayman, Ann Arbor, MI). The resultant immune complexes were immobilized by incubation with IgG cross-linked to agarose for 2 h at 4 °C, centrifuged, washed, boiled for 7 min in sample buffer, and again centrifuged. The supernatants were then processed for phosphotyrosine immunoblotting with PY-Plus mixture as described above. To control for immunoprecipitation efficiency and protein loading and transfer, blots were stripped and reprobed with the immunoprecipitating antibody. Immunoblots were captured for quantitative densitometry using a FUJIFILM LAS-3000 imaging system (FUJIFILM, Greenwood, SC), and each phosphotyrosine signal was normalized to its respective total signal on the same blot. Detection of SFK Activity by Cell-based ELISA—HMVEC-Ls (1.5×104 cells/well) were cultured for 48 h in flat bottom 96-well plates, after which they were exposed for increasing times to increasing concentrations of LPS. The cells were fixed, washed, quenched with H2O2 and NaN3, and microwaved, according to the manufacturer's protocol (SuperArray). The plates were washed, blocked, incubated with anti-phospho-SRC (Tyr416) or anti-pan-SRC antibodies, washed, and incubated with secondary antibody. The plates were incubated with developing solution, and the A450 nm for each well was determined. To normalize each well to relative cell number, the plates were washed, dried, incubated with protein stain, again washed, and solubilized in 1% SDS, and the A595 nm was determined. Each phospho-SRC and each pan-SRC well was normalized to cell number in the same well, and each normalized phospho-SRC value was normalized to its normalized pan-SRC value. SFK activity was calculated as phospho-SRC A450/A595 per pan-SRC A450/A595. Knockdown of TLR4 and SFKs through Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—SMARTPool siRNA duplex products designed to target TLR4, c-SRC, FYN, LYN, and YES, as well as control siRNA duplexes (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO), were preincubated with TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and the complexes were presented to HMVEC-Ls for 3 h in the absence of serum. At 72 h, ECs were lysed and processed for immunoblotting with anti-c-SRC, anti-FYN, anti-LYN, or anti-YES antibodies. TLR4 immunoblotting was performed at 24 h. To confirm equivalent protein loading and transfer, blots were stripped and reprobed with anti-β-tubulin antibody and developed with ECL. Once knockdown was established, the siRNAs were transfected into ECs for studies of SFK activation, ZA protein tyrosine phosphorylation, and transendothelial [14C]BSA flux. For the barrier assays, HMVEC-Ls were cultured to 70% confluence in plastic dishes, after which they were transfected with siRNA targeting FYN, c-SRC, LYN, YES, TLR4, or control siRNAs. After 24 h, the transfected cells were seeded into assay chambers and cultured for 48 h, after which the baseline barrier function was established. Only EC monolayers that retained ≥97% of the tracer molecule were exposed for 6 h to 100 ng/ml LPS or medium alone and again assayed for transendothelial [14C]BSA flux. Statistics—One-way analysis of variance with repeated measures, followed by post hoc comparisons using Tukey's multiple paired comparison test, was used to compare the mean responses among experimental and control groups for all experiments. The GraphPad PRISM 4 program for windows was used for these analyses. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. LPS Increases Transendothelial [14C]BSA Flux across HMVEC-Ls—Although we have demonstrated that LPS increases the paracellular permeability through PTK activation in bovine ECs, there are well known species differences in LPS responsiveness (44Bannerman D.D. Goldblum S.E. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1181-1199PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we studied the effect of LPS on barrier function in human ECs. At 6 h, LPS induced a dose-dependent increase in [14C]BSA flux across HMVEC-L monolayers (Fig. 1A). The minimum LPS concentration that increased albumin flux compared with the medium control was 3 ng/ml. The maximal increase in albumin flux, 0.082 pmol/h, was seen with 10,000 ng/ml of LPS. The LPS effect was also time-dependent (Fig. 1B). HMVEC-L monolayers were exposed to either of two fixed concentrations of LPS (10 and 100 ng/ml) or medium alone for increasing exposure times (0.5-6 h). Exposure to either 10 or 100 ng/ml LPS was associated with prolonged stimulus-to-response lag times of 4 and 6 h, respectively. Finally, a highly purified LPS preparation that lacks contaminating lipoproteins that activate TLR2 (42McIntire F.C. Sievert H.W. Barlow G.H. Finley R.A. Lee A.Y. Biochemis"
https://openalex.org/W1978383578,"Memory is usually associated with higher organisms rather than bacteria. However, evidence is mounting that many regulatory networks within bacteria are capable of complex dynamics and multi-stable behaviors that have been linked to memory in other systems. Moreover, it is recognized that bacteria that have experienced different environmental histories may respond differently to current conditions. These “memory” effects may be more than incidental to the regulatory mechanisms controlling acclimation or to the status of the metabolic stores. Rather, they may be regulated by the cell and confer fitness to the organism in the evolutionary game it participates in. Here, we propose that history-dependent behavior is a potentially important manifestation of memory, worth classifying and quantifying. To this end, we develop an information-theory based conceptual framework for measuring both the persistence of memory in microbes and the amount of information about the past encoded in history-dependent dynamics. This method produces a phenomenological measure of cellular memory without regard to the specific cellular mechanisms encoding it. We then apply this framework to a strain of Bacillus subtilis engineered to report on commitment to sporulation and degradative enzyme (AprE) synthesis and estimate the capacity of these systems and growth dynamics to ‘remember’ 10 distinct cell histories prior to application of a common stressor. The analysis suggests that B. subtilis remembers, both in short and long term, aspects of its cell history, and that this memory is distributed differently among the observables. While this study does not examine the mechanistic bases for memory, it presents a framework for quantifying memory in cellular behaviors and is thus a starting point for studying new questions about cellular regulation and evolutionary strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2054646594,"Staphylococcus aureus remains a clinical scourge. Recent studies have revealed that S. aureus is capable of mounting a response to antibiotics that target cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis, such as β-lactams and vancomycin. A phosphotransfer-mediated signaling pathway composed of a histidine protein kinase, VraS, and a response regulator protein, VraR, has been linked to the coordination of this response. Herein, we report for the first time on the signal transduction mechanism of the VraSR system. We found that VraS is capable of undergoing autophosphorylation in vitro and its phosphoryl group is rapidly transferred to VraR. In addition, phosphorylated VraR undergoes rapid dephosphorylation by VraS. Evidence is presented that VraR has adopted a novel strategy in regulating the output response of the VraSR-mediated signaling pathway. The VraR effector domain inhibits formation of inactive VraR dimers and, in doing so, it holds the regulatory domain into an intermediate active state. We show that only phosphorylation induces formation of the biological active VraR-dimer species. Furthermore, we propose that damage inflicted to cell wall peptidoglycan could be the main source of the stimuli that VraR responds to due to the tight control that VraS has on the phosphorylation state of VraR. Our findings provide for the first time insights into the molecular basis for the proposed role of VraSR as a sentinel system capable of rapidly sensing cell wall peptidoglycan damage and coordinating a response that enhances the resistance phenotype in S. aureus."

We found that cave mammillaries (water table indicator speleothems) from nine sites in the Grand Canyon showed uranium-lead dating evidence for an old western Grand Canyon on the assumption that groundwater table decline rates are equivalent to incision rates. Samples in the western Grand Canyon yielded apparent water table decline rates of 55 to 123 meters per million years over the past 17 million years, in contrast to eastern Grand Canyon samples that yielded much faster rates (166 to 411 meters per million years). Chronology and inferred incision data indicate that the Grand Canyon evolved via headward erosion from west to east, together with late-stage (∼3.7 million years ago) accelerated incision in the eastern block."

Photosynthetic bacteria provide an ideal system for investigating the conversion of light energy into chemical energy in nature. Only three different protein complexes are required for this conversion; the first is a so-called “core” complex composed of light-harvesting I (LH1) and reaction center (RC) complexes. Light energy absorbed by LH1 is transferred to the RC, where photochemical charge separation takes place (1van Grondelle R. Dekker J.P. Gillbro T. Sundström V. Biochim. Biophys.

This charge separation induces electron transfer coupled to production and migration of quinols to the cytochrome bc1 complex (3Berry E.A. Guergova-Kuras M. Huang L.S. Crofts A.R. Annu. Rev.

Most of the purple bacteria contain a second light-harvesting complex, LH2; each subunit of LH2 consists of two integral transmembrane polypeptides called α and β, which bind the bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) and carotenoid pigment molecules (6McDermott G.

The bacterial photosynthetic membrane is composed of closely packed arrays of LH2 and RC-LH1 complexes; atomic force microscopy (AFM) of membranes from several photosynthetic bacteria has revealed the organization of these arrays (7Scheuring S.

As a result of structural, functional, and AFM studies these are among the best characterized of any biological membrane. Recently, it has been possible to combine the data from structural and functional approaches to construct three-dimensional models of an entire membrane vesicle, comprising over a 100 complexes, at the atomic level (9Şener M.K.

Despite these advances, several important aspects of structure and function remain: it is not known how quinol molecules, the product of photochemistry, pass through the apparently closed LH1 rings that encircle RCs, nor how they migrate to the cytochrome bc1 complexes. Previous work has provided clues regarding the first of these issues, namely quinone/quinol exchange across the LH1 boundary. LH1, an oligomer of α/β transmembrane polypeptide pairs (10Zuber H.

To establish a link between membrane protein structure and membrane curvature, it is necessary to obtain a three-dimensional model of the dimer core complex, and to reconcile this information with the structural parameters of the native tubular membrane. In this work, we performed single particle analysis of negatively stained RC-LH1-PufX dimers and obtained a three-dimensional model at 25-Å resolution, the structure and shape of which reveal the basis for its capacity to impose membrane curvature, and enable the construction of a tubular membrane from its dimer building blocks. This membrane, which exhibits the same packing and geometry as the tubular membrane isolated from an LH2-minus mutant of Rba. sphaeroides, also explains in part the curvature of wild-type photosynthetic membranes in this bacterium, as well as the packing of reconstituted two-dimensional crystals of the dimeric core complex.

Two-dimensional Crystallization—Protein concentration for two-dimensional crystallization was adjusted to 0.5 mg/ml. It was mixed with 4 mg/ml extract of Escherichia coli lipids (Avanti Polar Lipids) solution to a lipid/protein ratio from 0.3 to 0.6 (w/w). Each 100-μl aliquot of these mixtures was dialyzed against buffer solution (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.01% Na3N, pH 7.5) at 20 °C for 10 days using a homemade continuous flow device (35Jap B.K. Zulauf M. Scheybani T. Hefti A. Baumeister W. Aebi U. Engel A. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 46: 45-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Electron Microscopy—Isolated native tubular membranes, reconstituted two-dimensional crystals, and dimeric RC-LH1-PufX samples were used for electron microscopy data collection. Samples were applied to glow discharged, carbon-coated copper grids (Agar Scientific), blotted, stained with 0.75% (w/v) uranyl formate, blotted, and dried in air. Electron micrographs were recorded on a Philips CM100 electron microscope fitted with 1K × 1K Gatan Multiscan 794 CCD camera at ×28,500 magnification for native tubular membranes and ×61,000 for purified RC-LH1-PufX. The magnification was calibrated from an image of negatively stained catalase crystals (Agar Scientific). Image Processing—Images of isolated native tubular membranes and two-dimensional crystals were processed using the MRC suite of programs (36Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) and DigitalMicrograph (Gatan) as described (15Jamieson S.J. Wang P. Qian P. Kirkland J.Y. Conroy M.J. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). For analysis of the single particles we used the IMAGIC-5 software package (Image Science Software GmbH) (37van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar, 38van Heel M. Keegstra W. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 7: 113-130Crossref Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In total, 4852 single molecule projections were boxed from electron micrographs using a box size of 100 × 100 pixels (1 pixel represents 3.92 Å) using the program XIMDISP (36Crowther R.A. Henderson R. Smith J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). All single particle images were aligned directly to a total average after normalization and band pass filtering. Cycles of multivariate statistical analysis were then performed (39van Heel F.J. Ultramicroscopy. 1981; 6: 187-194PubMed Google Scholar). A few easily interpretable classes were selected for multireference alignment calculation and further classification (40van Heel M. Gowen B. Matadeen R. Orlova E.V. Finn R. Pape T. Cohen D. Stark H. Schmidt R. Schatz M. Patwardhan A. Q. Rev. Biol. 2000; 33: 307-369Google Scholar, 41van Heel M. Stöffler-Meilicke M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2389-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). An initial three-dimensional reference model of the dimeric RC-LH1-PufX complex was produced by the use of three easily interpretable classes, viz. a projection parallel to the membrane plane (“side view”), a projection perpendicular to the periplasmic face (“top view”), and a projection perpendicular to the cytoplasmic face (“bottom view”). The Euler angles of these three views were defined as (0, 90, 0), (0, 0, 0), and (0, 180, 0), respectively. Re-projections from this reference three-dimensional model were used for Euler angle assignment of all averaged classes (42van Heel M. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 21: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). The initial three-dimensional reconstruction incorporating all class averages was then calculated from the classes that together represented about 94% of the whole data set. The three-dimensional reconstruction was refined by further cycles of re-projection, multivariate statistical analysis, and multireference alignment until no further improvements could be seen. Orientation Fitting of the RCs in the Dimer—The atomic resolution model of the RC from Rba. sphaeroides (43Koepke J. Hu X.C. Muenke C. Schulten K. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 581-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) was used for the calculation of RC orientation in the dimeric RC-LH1-PufX complex. The approximate orientation in the X-Y plane of the dimer molecule was as determined by Qian et al. (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). On the Z-X plane, the RC orientation was fitted against the side view of the three-dimensional reconstruction model of the dimer by rotating the RC around its x axis. Projection maps were calculated for various angles of tilt of the RC out of the membrane plane and compared qualitatively with the experimentally determined projection map of Ref. 22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar using the CCP4 program suite (44CCP4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19758) Google Scholar). Purification of the RC-LH1-PufX Dimer and Native Tubular Membranes—Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE of the purified dimer demonstrated only six bands; three from the RC L-, M-, and H-subunits, two from LH1 α and β, and a poorly stained one from PufX (see supplementary data). The purity of the preparation was further confirmed by EM; electron micrographs of diluted, negatively stained complexes showed that the majority of the particles on the EM grid are dimers (Fig. 1A). In total, 4852 well separated dimer particles were selected from the electron micrographs for image data processing (Fig. 1B). The tubular membrane fraction harvested from the sucrose step gradient is a mixture of tubular membranes and normal smaller, curved membrane fragments. The average width of the isolated tubular membrane when flattened on the carbon support film of the EM grid was 113 nm. Three-dimensional Model of the RC-LH1-PufX Dimer—The 25 averaged classes used to construct a low resolution three-dimensional model of the dimer core complex are displayed in Fig. 2A. With reference to the cryo-EM projection map of the dimer (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), class 25, for example, can be identified as a side view, looking parallel to the membrane plane, class 1 as a view from the cytoplasmic side looking perpendicular to the membrane plane, and class 2 as a view from the periplasmic side. To confirm the consistency of the reconstruction with the original averaged data, re-projection images were produced from the final three-dimensional dimer model (Fig. 2B). All re-projections are consistent with the original averaged classes with correlation coefficients between 0.90 and 0.98. The final three-dimensional model (Figs. 3, A-F) reveals some of the notable structural characteristics of this dimer molecule. The two central densities that protrude from the surrounding LH1 complexes can be assigned to RCs, based upon the previous assignment of the corresponding densities in the cryo-EM projection map (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The threshold for surface rendering was chosen so as to form a tight fit round the RC, which has a molecular mass of 104 kDa; the dimer complex is predicted to be 487 kDa. This has several important consequences for the shape of the LH1 ring; although most of the wall of LH1 αβ subunits has a constant height of ∼7.4 nm, corresponding to the second 12th αβ subunits assigned previously (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), there is enough contrast to distinguish a weaker region of density for the LH1 ring, in a region corresponding to the 14th αβ subunit. This region of density, indicated by a red arrow in Fig. 3, A-C, corresponds to the “gap” identified in earlier projection images of negatively stained membranes (20Jungas C. Ranck J.L. Rigaud J.L. Joliot P. Verméglio A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Siebert C.A. Qian P. Fotiadis D. Engel A. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A clear 2-fold symmetry axis relates the two halves of the dimer. The side view of this dimer clearly shows that the two halves of RC-LH1-PufX are inclined toward each other at an angle of ∼146°, forming a distinct “V” shape. The height of the dimer measured from the cytoplasmic side to the periplasmic side is 9.5 nm. The length of 20.4 nm and width of 12.8 nm are consistent with the result from the projection structure determined by cryo-EM (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Finally, the structures in Fig. 3, A and C, show that there is a “hole” in the density map, adjacent to the RC, and separated from the exterior by that part of the LH1 boundary denoted by the arrow. Fig. 4A shows a superposition of the low resolution three-dimensional structure from the current single particle analysis and the projection map calculated from frozen two-dimensional crystals (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which gives a good qualitative match of the positions of the transmembrane helices with the three-dimensional model. Closer inspection of this superposition shows that the weaker region of LH1 density in the three-dimensional model, identified by the red arrows in Fig. 3, A-C, and also in Fig. 4A, corresponds to the αβ14 pair in the projection map. With the hindsight of this tilted dimer structure, it is likely that in the cryo-EM analysis of two-dimensional crystals (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the relatively strong densities for the αβ subunits at the central interface region of the dimer reflect a perpendicular orientation to the support carbon film on the grid, whereas the weaker densities at the outer edges of the LH1 ring in the cryo-EM projection map are consistent with tilted LH1 helices. The side view of the V-shaped three-dimensional model (Fig. 4B) shows the extent of this tilt; here, two atomic resolution RC models (43Koepke J. Hu X.C. Muenke C. Schulten K. Michel H. Structure. 1996; 4: 581-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar) are shown fitted into the EM three-dimensional model; it is clear that an optimal fit must include a tilt of the RC. To provide a rough test of this tilt, a projection map of the tilted RC in Fig. 4B was calculated and then superimposed (in red) on the actual projection of the RC obtained in the cryo-EM projection map (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The calculated projection map of a non-tilted RC gives a poor match with the observed density (results not shown). In contrast, the good qualitative agreement between the model and experimental projections shows that the projection in Ref. 22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar is entirely consistent with the RC being tilted relative to the direction of view down the dimer axis. In particular, the strong density of the single transmembrane helix of the RC H-subunit in the cryo-EM map is now explained; the tilting of the whole complex orients this helix so it becomes more perpendicular to the support carbon film (see left-hand RC, blue helix, in Fig. 4B). Calculation of Structural Parameters for Tubular Two-dimensional Crystals and Native Membranes, each Composed of Dimeric RC-LH1-PufX Complexes—When purified dimeric RC-LH1-PufX molecules are mixed with lipids in buffer solution and dialyzed against detergent-free buffer solution they can form an artificial tubular membrane. When flattened on a carbon film support, such tubes form two crystalline layers, each composed of a single molecular layer of dimer core complexes, which can be treated as two-dimensional crystals for EM structural analysis (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is straightforward to observe the arrangement of dimer molecules in the flattened tubule using negative stain. The projection map of the two-dimensional crystal showed that the dimeric molecules are assembled with a p22121 symmetry (see Fig. 5A) (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The dimer molecules make contact so as to stack in a direction parallel to their short axis, in a direction indicated by the shorter of the two red arrows in the inset to Fig. 5A, to form a linear array of dimers that follows the red line in the view of the flattened crystal in the main part of Fig. 5A. The dimer molecules in neighboring arrays take an up-down-up orientation (see Fig. 5A, inset), which results in alternating darker/lighter stripes of negative stain in the crystal. Given that the assembly of dimeric RC-LH1-PufX forms a perfect helical curve, prior to flattening on the EM grid, it can be described using the following parametric equation,x=r.cos⁡(t)y=r⋅sin⁡(t)z=c.t([Eq. 1]) where r is the radius of the helix, t is the angle the point (x, y, z) makes with the x axis (projected to the xy plane), and 2πc is the pitch of the helix (Fig. 5A). The arc length is given by Equation 2. s=r2+c2t([Eq. 2]) Because 4 = w/π and c = r. tan(α), where w is the width of the tubule flattened on the EM grid and α is the gradient of the helix, the arc length of one helical repeat is given. s=(w/π) 2(1+tan2(α)).2π([Eq. 3]) With the unit cell parameters, a = 13.1 nm, b = 41.0 nm, γ = 90° determined previously (22Qian P. Hunter C.N. Bullough P.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 948-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) the total number of molecules in one helical repeat can be calculated as n = s/a, and the angular separation of each molecule in the helix, therefore, is τ = 360/n. The same analysis can be applied to determining the helical structural parameters for the native tubular membrane (Fig. 5B). A previous analysis of purified"
https://openalex.org/W1968755166,"Hyaluronan is a major component of the pericellular matrix surrounding tumor cells, including colon carcinomas. Elevated cycooxygenase-2 levels have been implicated in several malignant properties of colon cancer. We now show for the first time a strong link between hyaluronan-CD44 interaction and cyclooxygenase-2 in colon cancer cells. First, we have shown that increased expression of hyaluronan synthase-2 induces malignant cell properties, including increased proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HIEC6 cells. Second, constitutive hyaluronan-CD44 interaction stimulates a signaling pathway involving ErbB2, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, beta-catenin, and cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E(2) in HCA7 colon carcinoma cells. Third, the HA/CD44-activated ErbB2 --> phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT --> beta-catenin pathway stimulates cell survival/cell proliferation through COX-2 induction in hyaluronan-overexpressing HIEC6 cells and in HCA7 cells. Fourth, perturbation of hyaluronan-CD44 interaction by hyaluronan oligomers or CD44-silencing RNA decreases cyclooxygenase-2 expression and enzyme activity, and inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 decreases hyaluronan production suggesting the possibility of an amplifying positive feedback loop between hyaluronan and cyclooxygenase-2. We conclude that hyaluronan is an important endogenous regulator of colon cancer cell survival properties and that cyclooxygenase-2 is a major mediator of these hyaluronan-induced effects. Defining hyaluronan-dependent cyclooxygenase-2/prostaglandin E(2)-associated signaling pathways will provide a platform for developing novel therapeutic approaches for colon cancer."

Desflurane is one of the most commonly used inhalation anesthetics. However, the effects of desflurane on AD neuropathogenesis have not been previously determined. Here, we set out to assess the effects of desflurane and hypoxia on caspase activation, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and amyloid β-protein (Aβ) generation in H4 human neuroglioma cells (H4 naïve cells) as well as those overexpressing APP (H4-APP cells). Neither 12% desflurane nor hypoxia (18% O2) alone affected caspase-3 activation, APP processing, and Aβ generation. However, treatment with a combination of 12% desflurane and hypoxia (18% O2) (desflurane/hypoxia) for 6 h induced caspase-3 activation, altered APP processing, and increased Aβ generation in H4-APP cells. Desflurane/hypoxia also increased levels of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme in H4-APP cells. In addition, desflurane/hypoxia-induced Aβ generation could be reduced by the broad caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD. Finally, the Aβ aggregation inhibitor clioquinol and γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 attenuated caspase-3 activation induced by desflurane/hypoxia. In summary, desflurane can induce Aβ production and caspase activation, but only in the presence of hypoxia.

These perioperative factors may also cause post-operative cognitive dysfunction, a dementia associated with surgery and anesthesia, by triggering AD neuropathogenesis.Isoflurane, sevoflurane, and desflurane are the most commonly used inhalation anesthetics.

However, effects of desflurane and desflurane plus other perioperative risk factors, e.g. hypoxia, on APP processing and Aβ generation have not been assessed.In the present study, we set out to determine effects of desflurane, hypoxia, and the combination of the two (desflurane/hypoxia) on caspase-3 activation, APP processing, and Aβ generation in H4 human neuroglioma cells (H4 naïve cells) and H4 naïve cells stably transfected to express full-length (FL) APP (H4-APP cells). We also investigated whether the caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD, the γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458, and the Aβ aggregation inhibitor clioquinol could attenuate desflurane/hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and Aβ generation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines—We employed H4 human neuroglioma cells (H4 naïve cells) and H4 naïve cells stably transfected to express full-length (FL) APP (H4-APP cells) in the experiments. All of the cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 9% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine. Stably transfected H4 cells were additionally supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418.Cell Treatment—The cells were treated for 6 h with following three conditions: desflurane alone (21% O2, 5% CO2, and 12% desflurane), hypoxia alone (18% O2 and 5% CO2), and desflurane/hypoxia (18% O2, 5% CO2, and 12% desflurane). Control conditions included 5% CO2 plus 21% O2, which did not affect caspase-3 activation, cell viability, APP processing, and Aβ generation (45Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Alfille P. Culley D.J. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Anesthesiology. 2006; 104: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 46Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Moir R. Inouye S.K. Culley D.J. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. J. Gerontol. A Biol.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We used 18% O2 to establish mildly hypoxic conditions. In the interaction studies, the cells were treated with Z-VAD (50 μm,), L-685,458 (0.5 μm), clioquinol (CQ) (1 μm), and Aβ40 (7.5 μm) plus Aβ42 (7.5 μm) 1 h before desflurane/hypoxia treatment. The controls for Z-VAD, L685,458, and CQ were Me2SO, whereas the control condition for Aβ was phosphate-buffered saline. Control conditions for desflurane, hypoxia, and desflurane/hypoxia were 5% CO2 plus 21% O2, which did not affect caspase-3 activation, cell viability, APP processing, and Aβ generation (data not shown).Cell Lysis and Protein Amount Quantification—Cell pellets were detergent-extracted on ice using immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) plus protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were collected, centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min, and quantified for total proteins by BCA protein assay kit (Pierce).Western Blots Analysis—The cells were harvested at the end of the experiments and were subjected to Western blots analyses as described by Xie et al. (52Xie Z. Romano D.M. Tanzi R.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies A8717 (1:1,000; Sigma) and C66 (1:1,000, generous gift of Dr. Dora Kovacs at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School) were used to visualize FL-APP (110 kDa) and APP-CTFs (10–12 kDa). Antibody anti-β-actin (1:2,000, Sigma) was used to detect β-actin (42 kDa). A caspase-3 antibody (1:1,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) was used to recognize FL-caspase-3 (35–40 kDa) and caspase-3 fragment (17–20 kDa) resulting from cleavage at asparate position 175. Rabbit polyclonal anti-BACE-1 antibody (1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) was used to detect protein levels of BACE (65 kDa). The quantification of Western blots was performed as described by Xie et al. (52Xie Z. Romano D.M. Tanzi R.E. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 67-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, intensity of signals was analyzed by using the National Institutes of Health image program (NIH Image 1.62). We quantified Western blots using two steps. First, we used levels of β-actin to normalize (e.g. determining ratio of FL-APP amount to β-actin amount) levels of FL-APP, APP-CTFs, FL-caspase-3, caspase-3 fragment, and BACE to control for any loading differences in total protein amounts. Second, we presented changes in levels of FL-APP, APP-CTFs, FL-caspase-3, caspase-3 fragment, and BACE in treated cells as a percentage of those in cells treated with controls.Quantification of Aβ Using Sandwich Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Secreted Aβ was measured with a Sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by using an Aβ measurement kit (Invitrogen), and by the Aβ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay core facility at the Center for Neurological Diseases, Harvard Institute of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, as described by Xie et al. (53Xie Z. Romano D.M. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15413-15421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Specifically, 96-well plates were coated with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific to Aβ40 (2G3) or Aβ42 (21F12). Following blocking with Block Ace, wells were incubated overnight at 4 °C with test samples of conditioned cell culture media, and then an anti-Aβ (α-Aβ-HR1) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added. The plates were then developed with TMB reagent, and well absorbance was measured at 450 nm. Aβ levels in test samples were determined by comparison with signal from unconditioned media spiked with known quantities of Aβ40 and Aβ42.Statistics—Given the presence of background caspase-3 activation and cell death in cells cultured in serum-free medium, we did not use absolute values to describe changes in caspase-3 activation. Instead, 100% caspase-3 activation, FL-APP, APP-CTFs, and BACE in the manuscript refer to control levels for the purpose of comparison to experimental conditions. The data were expressed as the means ± S.D. The number of samples varied from 3 to 10, and the samples were normally distributed. We used a two-tailed t test to compare differences between experimental groups and control groups. p values less than 0.05 (* or #) and 0.01 (** or ##) were considered statistically significant.RESULTSDesflurane Does Not Cause Caspase-3 Activation, APP Processing, or Secreted Aβ Levels in H4-APP Cells—We previously reported that isoflurane can induce apoptosis and increase secreted Aβ levels in H4-APP cells (45Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Alfille P. Culley D.J. Crosby G. Tanzi R.E. Anesthesiology. 2006; 104: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 46Xie Z. Dong Y. Maeda U. Moir R. Inouye S.K. Culley D.J.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The effects of other commonly used inhalation anesthetics, including sevoflurane and desflurane, on cellular apoptosis, APP processing, and Aβ generation have not been reported. We therefore set out to determine these effects in H4-APP cells. Because caspase-3 activation is one of the final steps of cellular apoptosis (54Thornberry N.A. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: R97-R103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), we assessed effects of desflurane on caspase-3 activation by quantitative Western blot analyses. In the present experiment, treatment with 12% desflurane for 6 h only induced modest caspase-3 cleavage (activation) (Fig. 1A), as assessed by determining the ratio of cleaved (activated) caspase-3 fragment (17–19 kDa) to FL-caspase-3 (35–40 kDa). Quantification of the Western blots, based on the ratio of caspase-3 fragment to FL-caspase-3, revealed that the desflurane treatment did not significantly induce caspase-3 activation as compared with control conditions: 100% versus 127% (p = 0.14) (Fig. 1B). APP immunoblotting revealed no significant differences in levels of FL-APP and APP-CTFs between desflurane-treated and control H4-APP cells (Fig. 1, C–E). Finally, the desflurane treatment did not increase secreted levels of Aβ40 or Aβ42 as compared with control conditions (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that desflurane alone neither induces apoptosis nor increases Aβ generation.Desflurane/Hypoxia Induces Caspase-3 Activation, Affects APP Processing, and Increases Secreted Aβ Levels in H4-APP Cells—Because hypoxia has been reported to potentiate AD neuropathogenesis (43Xie Z. Moir R.D. Romano D.M. Tesco G. Kovacs D.M. Tanzi R.E. Neurodegener. Dis. 2004; 1: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 55Sun X. He G. Qing H. Zhou W. Dobie F. Cai F. Staufenbiel M. Huang L.E. Song W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 18727-18732Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), we assessed the effects of desflurane/hypoxia on caspase-3 activation, APP processing, and secreted Aβ levels in H4-APP cells. We chose 18% O2 to assess the effects of desflurane on apoptosis and Aβ generation under mildly hypoxic conditions. Caspase-3 immunoblotting showed visible increases in protein levels of caspase-3 fragment following treatment with 12% desflurane/hypoxia (18%) for 6 h as compared with control conditions (Fig. 2A). Quantification of the results by determining ratio of cleaved (activated) caspase-3 fragment (17–19 kDa) to FL-caspase-3 (35–40 kDa) revealed that desflurane/hypoxia treatment led to a 306% increase in caspase-3 cleavage (activation) as compared with control conditions (p = 0.002). APP immunoblotting showed visible decreases in protein levels of APP-CTFs (10–12 kDa), but not FL-APP (110 kDa), following the desflurane/hypoxia treatment as compared with control conditions (Fig. 2C). Quantification of the results showed that the desflurane/hypoxia treatment led to a 49% decrease in levels of APP-CTFs as compared with control conditions (Fig. 2E, p = 0.019). Finally, the desflurane/hypoxia treatment increased secreted Aβ40: 5.3 pg/ml versus 15.9 pg/ml, p = 0.002 and Aβ42: 1.9 pg/ml versus 6.7 pg/ml, p = 0.018 (Fig. 2F). These findings suggest that the combination of desflurane and hypoxia induces apoptosis, alters APP processing, and increases Aβ generation.FIGURE 2Desflurane/hypoxia induces caspase-3 activation, affects APP processing, and increases Aβ levels in H4-APP cells. A, treatment with 12% desflurane/hypoxia (18%) for 6 h (lanes 4–6) induces caspase-3 cleavage (activation) as compared with control conditions (lanes 1–3) in H4-APP cells. There is no significant difference in the amounts of β-actin in control conditions or desflurane/hypoxia-treated H4-APP cells. B, quantification of the Western blot shows that desflurane/hypoxia treatment (black bar) (**, p = 0.002) increases caspase-3 activation compared with control conditions (white bar), normalized to β-actin levels. C, desflurane/hypoxia (lanes 4 and 5) reduces levels of APP-CTFs, but not FL-APP, as compared with control conditions (lanes 1–3) in H4-APP cells. There is no significant difference in amounts of β-actin in control conditions or desflurane/hypoxia-treated H4-APP cells. D, quantification of the Western blot shows that desflurane/hypoxia (black bar) does not alter levels of FL-APP as compared with control conditions (white bar)(p = 0.789, NS), normalized to β-actin levels. E, quantification of the Western blot shows that desflurane/hypoxia (black bar) decreases levels of APP-CTFs as compared with control conditions (white bar) (*, p = 0.019), normalized to β-actin levels.

For this purpose, we set out to assess the effects of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD on desflurane/hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation and Aβ generation. Z-VAD treatment attenuated caspase-3 activation induced by desflurane/hypoxia treatment, whereas Z-VAD alone did not induce caspase-3 activation as compared with control conditions (Fig. 3A). Quantification of the Western blots revealed that Z-VAD attenuated desflurane/hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation: 304% versus 94%, p = 0.009 (Fig. 3B). Z-VAD also reduced desflurane/hypoxia-induced increases in secreted Aβ levels in H4-APP cells, p = 0.00038 (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3Caspase inhibitor Z-VAD attenuates caspase-3 activation induced by desflurane/hypoxia in H4-APP cells. A, treatment with desflurane (12%) plus hypoxia (18%) for 6 h (lanes 5 and 6) induces caspase-3 cleavage (activation) as compared with control conditions (lanes 1 and 2) or Z-VAD (50 μm) treatment (lanes 3 and 4). Z-VAD treatment (lane 7 and 8) attenuates caspase-3 cleavage induced by desflurane/hypoxia. There is no significant difference in amounts of β-actin in H4-APP cells with above treatments. B, quantification of the Western blot shows that desflurane/hypoxia (black bar) increases caspase-3 activation as compared with control conditions (white bar) (*, p = 0.016), normalized to β-actin levels. The desflurane/hypoxia-induced caspase-3 activation is reduced by Z-VAD (50 μm) treatment (net bar; ##, p = 0.009). C, desflurane/hypoxia (black bar) increases secreted Aβ levels in H4-APP cells as compared with control conditions (white bar) (**, p = 0.0032).

https://openalex.org/W1980066447,"The phospholipid composition of the membrane and transporter structure control the subcellular location and function of osmosensory transporter ProP in Escherichia coli. Growth in media of increasing osmolality increases, and entry to stationary phase decreases, the proportion of phosphatidate in anionic lipids (phosphatidylglycerol (PG) plus cardiolipin (CL)). Both treatments increase the CL:PG ratio. Transporters ProP and LacY are concentrated with CL (and not PG) near cell poles and septa. The polar concentration of ProP is CL-dependent. Here we show that the polar concentration of LacY is CL-independent. The osmotic activation threshold of ProP was directly proportional to the CL content of wild type bacteria, the PG content of CL-deficient bacteria, and the anionic lipid content of cells and proteoliposomes. CL was effective at a lower concentration in cells than in proteoliposomes, and at a much lower concentration than PG in either system. Thus, in wild type bacteria, osmotic induction of CL synthesis and concentration of ProP with CL at the cell poles adjust the osmotic activation threshold of ProP to match ambient conditions. ProP proteins linked by homodimeric, C-terminal coiled-coils are known to activate at lower osmolalities than those without such structures and coiled-coil disrupting mutations raise the osmotic activation threshold. Here we show that these mutations also prevent polar concentration of ProP. Stabilization of the C-terminal coiled-coil by covalent cross-linking of introduced Cys reverses the impact of increasing CL on the osmotic activation of ProP. Association of ProP C termini with the CL-rich membrane at cell poles may raise the osmotic activation threshold by blocking coiled-coil formation. Mutations that block coiled-coil formation may also block association of the C termini with the CL-rich membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2008238824,"Myosin folding and assembly in striated muscle are mediated by the general chaperones Hsc70 and Hsp90 and involve a myosin-specific co-chaperone related to the Caenorhabditis elegans gene unc-45. Two unc-45 genes are found in vertebrates, a general cell isoform, unc45a, and a striated muscle-specific isoform, unc45b. We have investigated the role of both isoforms of mouse Unc45 in myosin folding using an in vitro synthesis and folding assay. A smooth muscle myosin motor domain (MD) fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (MD::GFP) was used as substrate, and folding was measured by native gel electrophoresis and functional assays. In the absence of Unc45, the MD::GFP chimera folds poorly. Addition of either Unc45a or Unc45b dramatically enhances the folding in a reaction that is dependent on Hsp90 ATPase activity. Unc45a is more effective than Unc45b with a higher apparent affinity and greater extent of folding. The Unc45-Hsp90 chaperone complex acts late in the folding pathway and promotes motor domain maturation after release from the ribosome. Unc45a behaves kinetically as an activator of the folding reaction by stimulating the rate of the Hsp90-dependent folding by >20-fold with an apparent Kact of 33 nm. This analysis of vertebrate Unc45 isoforms clearly demonstrates a direct role for Unc45 in Hsp90-mediated myosin motor domain folding and highlights major differences between the isoforms in substrate specificity and mechanism.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3681-3686Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). All myosin classes share a conserved catalytic domain of ∼750 residues that contains the ATPase activity and actin-binding site responsible for force production and motion (2Rayment I. Rypniewski W.R. Schmidt-Base K. Smith R. Tomchick D.R. Benning M.M. Winkelmann D.A. Wesenberg G. Holden H.M. Science. 1993; 261: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). We have shown that folding and assembly of the class II vertebrate striated muscle myosin follow a chaperone-assisted pathway (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol.

In a reticulocyte lysate synthesis assay, the myosin rod domain assembles and dimerizes, and the myosin light chains associate with the motor domain, but myosin motor domain folding is slow and incomplete. The striated muscle motor domain is folded efficiently only in muscle cells, indicating a requirement for muscle-specific factors (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In striated muscle cells myosin maturation and assembly proceed through the formation of a transient complex containing nascent myosin with partially folded motor domains assembled into filaments and associated with the general chaperones Hsp90 2The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; MD, motor domain; MD::GFP, chimera of myosin motor domain fused to green fluorescent protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat. 2The abbreviations used are: Hsp, heat shock protein; MD, motor domain; MD::GFP, chimera of myosin motor domain fused to green fluorescent protein; TPR, tetratricopeptide repeat. and Hsc70 (5Srikakulam R.

The general chaperones Hsp90 and Hsp70 are abundant proteins in muscle and in the reticulocyte lysate synthesis system (8Murphy P.J. Kanelakis K.C. Galigniana M.D. Morishima Y. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30092-30098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), yet this system is not sufficient for the folding of the striated muscle myosin motor domain. What other factors are required for efficient motor domain folding? The Caenorhabditis elegans unc-45 gene encodes an ∼103-kDa protein (UNC-45) that is important for the establishment of organized body wall muscles (9Venolia L. Waterston R.H.

Epstein H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The protein has three basic motifs as follows: an N-terminal domain with three tetratricopeptide repeats (TPR), a central region of unknown function, and an ∼450-residue C-terminal UCS domain that is shared by proteins that interact with myosin. The TPR motif is a protein-protein interaction module of 34 amino acids that is often involved in Hsp90 and Hsp70 binding (12Scheufler C. Brinker A. Bourenkov G. Pegoraro S. Moroder L. Bartunik H.

Hutagalung A.H. Brinker A. Hartl F.U. Epstein H.F. Science. 2002; 295: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The UCS domain is a homology region found in C. elegans unc-45, in CRO1 from the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina (14Berteaux-Lecellier V. Zickler D. Debuchy R. Panvier-Adoutte A.

Biol. 2003; 13: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the three founding family members. Mutations in the UCS domain of these genes result in decreased accumulation and altered assembly of striated muscle myosin filaments, disruption of contractile ring formation, and disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, linking them to myosin cellular activities. Rng3p, the Schizosaccharomyces pombe UCS protein, activates myosin II motility in vitro, suggesting a direct interaction and regulatory role for the UCS domain (16Lord M. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The UCS domain of UNC-45 blocks thermal aggregation of the myosin head consistent with a role as a co-chaperone that links Hsp90 with the motor domain (13Barral J.M. Hutagalung A.H. Brinker A. Hartl F.U. Epstein H.F. Science. 2002; 295: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Swo1p, the S. pombe Hsp90 ortholog, genetically interacts with Rng3p to facilitate myosin assembly in the contractile ring again linking these three proteins despite the absence of the TPR motif in Rng3p (17Wong K.C.

Temperature-sensitive alleles of this gene disrupt thick filament assembly in the body wall muscle at nonpermissive temperatures, and UNC-45 co-localizes with non-muscle myosin in C. elegans embryos (9Venolia L.

Vertebrates express two distinct genes that are orthologs of C. elegans unc-45 (21Price M.G. Landsverk M.L. Barral J.M. Epstein H.F. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4013-4023Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). One, unc45a (formerly GC-UNC-45), is expressed generally in all tissues, and expression of the other, unc45b (formerly SM-UNC-45), is limited to striated muscle. We have cloned and expressed the two isoforms of mouse Unc45 to assess the role of these proteins in myosin motor domain folding. Unc45a and Unc45b both stimulate the folding of a smooth muscle myosin motor domain in the reticulocyte lysate synthesis assay. Unc45a shows selectivity for the smooth muscle myosin motor domain and stimulates folding by activating the rate of the Hsp90-dependent reaction. This is the first direct demonstration of Unc45 chaperone activity in the de novo folding of the myosin motor domain and clearly establishes a role for Unc45a and Hsp90 in myosin maturation. Surprisingly, addition of neither Unc45 isoform is sufficient to activate the folding of the striated muscle motor domain indicating that additional factors are still required for this folding pathway. Vector Construction—Full-length cDNA for Unc45a and Unc45b were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts and mature C2C12 myotube total RNA using primers derived from the mouse genome data base. The cloned cDNAs were validated by bidirectional sequencing and comparison to the mouse genome. The inserts were cloned into the NcoI-NotI sites of pET21d (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) after modification of the 5′ and 3′ ends to incorporate these sites. The six His tag coding sequence in the vector was added to the 3′ end of the cDNAs with the addition of a two-residue linker sequence. Similarly, a 3× FLAG tag was substituted for the His tag in the same base vector for synthesis of C-terminal FLAG-tagged variants of the Unc45 isoforms. Construction of the vectors for the skeletal muscle MD::GFP chimera (Sk795GFP) has been described in detail elsewhere (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the chicken gizzard smooth muscle myosin motor domain was provided by Kathy Trybus, University of Vermont (22Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). The design of smooth muscle MD::GFP expression vector is identical to the Sk795GFP vector with the junction between the MD and GFP at a conserved sequence in an α-helix preceding the essential LC-binding site (supplemental Fig. 2s). The skeletal muscle motor domain was excised and replaced with the smooth muscle motor domain, and the construction was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing. The smooth muscle MD::GFP chimera produced a 116-kDa protein when expressed in the coupled translation assay. Protein Preparation—The pET21-Unc45a-His and pET21-Unc45b-His vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus, and single colonies were grown aerobically at 37 °C in ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 μg/ml) supplemented LB medium to an OD of 0.4 and then induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and harvested 4–6 h later. Bacterial lysis and purification of Unc45-His were done with a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid fast start kit following the manufacturer's instructions for native proteins (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Proteins bound to the affinity resin were eluted with a buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, pooled, and dialyzed against 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The pooled protein was applied to a Tricorn Mono Q 10/100 GL column and eluted with a linear 0.15–1.0 m NaCl gradient. The Unc45-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and further purified by gel filtration on a Superose 6 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare). This preparation was >98% pure, and the protein concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 4 centrifugal filter device (Millipore) was stored frozen in Mono Q buffer (supplemental Fig. 1s). The FLAG-tagged variants of Unc45 were expressed using the pET system and purified by ion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography, omitting the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid purification step. Hsp90 was purified from rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Green Hectares, Madison, WI). A high salt stripped, ribosome-free supernatant was prepared from the lysate by adding KCl to 1 m and centrifugation for 61 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman Ti70 rotor at 4 °C. The supernatant was dialyzed into 100 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5 (Buffer A), and fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on a Tricorn Mono Q 10/100 GL column (GE Healthcare) with a linear 0.1–0.5 m KCl gradient. Hsp90 elutes at ∼0.4 m KCl. The Hsp90 fractions were pooled, concentrated with an Amicon Ultra 4 centrifugal filter, and stored frozen in Buffer A. Myosin and myosin subfragments were prepared from adult white leghorn chicken pectoralis muscle as described previously (23Winkelmann D.A. Lowey S. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 595-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Assays—All in vitro expression vectors contain myosin coding sequences cloned downstream of the SP6 promoter of the pGEM4 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Coupled transcription and translation assays using Promega Quick Mix SP6 kits were supplemented with Redivue l-[35S]methionine (GE Healthcare) and incubated for 90 min at 30 °C with 2 μg of plasmid DNA per 50-μl reaction as described previously (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Folding of the MD::GFP chimera was analyzed by native gel electrophoresis in a modified Laemmli Tris-glycine electrophoresis system that lacked SDS (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). The stacking gel is 5% acrylamide in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and the running gel is 10% acrylamide in 375 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8. The running buffer is 25 mm Tris-HCl, 192 mm glycine, pH 8.3, and sample loading buffer is 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue. Electrophoresis was for 3 h at 20–25 mA constant current (4 °C). Band intensities were quantified from autoradiographs of dried gels with iVision image analysis software (BioVision Technologies, Exton, PA). Proteins were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar). Anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody-coupled agarose beads were washed according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Sigma), and Unc45FLAG proteins were incubated with 1:1 slurry of M2-agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The anti-FLAG-agarose beads with bound protein were collected by brief centrifugation at 1,000 × g and washed with 1 ml of buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4) for 40 min at 4 °C, followed by three washes with the same buffer for 10 min each before use in binding assays. The beads were incubated with increasing amounts of Hsp90 (0–4 μm) for 2 h at 4 °C, recovered by centrifugation, and washed four times with buffer. Bound proteins were extracted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed. Hsp90 and Unc45 binding interactions were analyzed on a Superose 6 HR 10/300 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) in Buffer A. The Superose 6 column was calibrated using purified proteins as follows: rabbit Hsp90, Unc45a, Unc45b, and papain myosin subfragment-1. Actin binding assays used 25 μl of a translation reaction and 50 μg of fresh F-actin depleted of ATP or with added MgATP as described previously (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Motor domain folding kinetics were measured by translating the smooth MD::GFP chimera for 90 min at 30 °C and terminating translation with 0.36 μm cycloheximide (Sigma). Aliquots of the translation were incubated with varying concentrations of Unc45a, and samples were removed at time points and diluted into native gel loading buffer containing 7 μm geldanamycin (A. G. Scientific Inc., San Diego, CA) to inhibit Hsp90 ATPase activity. Motor Domain Folding Assay—The two mouse orthologs of C. elegans unc-45 were cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse NIH 3T3 fibroblast (Unc45a) and C2C12 myotubes (Unc45b) (supplemental Fig. 1s). The full-length cDNA clones were inserted into bacterial expression vectors and modified by addition of a C-terminal six His tag sequence. Both mouse Unc45 isoforms were expressed in E. coli, extracted as soluble proteins, and affinity purified via the His tag. Analysis of purified Unc45a and Unc45b by SDS-PAGE demonstrates >98% purity, and they elute as ∼100 kDa monomeric species when analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography. We have demonstrated the utility of in vitro synthesis of myosin subfragments in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate-coupled transcription and translation assay for studying the steps in folding and maturation of myosin (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 4Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27265-27273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Light chain binding and folding and dimerization of the S2 domain of the rod were shown to precede motor domain folding. Furthermore, using a striated muscle motor domain GFP chimera (MD::GFP), we have found that folding of the muscle MD is dependent on factors uniquely present in muscle cells (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast to striated muscle myosin, smooth muscle myosin has been efficiently produced and isolated from heterologous expression systems (22Dominguez R. Freyzon Y. Trybus K.M. Cohen C. Cell. 1998; 94: 559-571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). We constructed an MD::GFP chimera of the smooth muscle myosin that is identical in design to the striated muscle MD::GFP chimera (supplemental Fig. 2s). This smooth muscle myosin chimera has been used to develop a de novo synthesis and folding assay and to test the effect of the putative myosin co-chaperones Unc45a and Unc45b on myosin motor domain folding. The smooth MD::GFP chimera is efficiently synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate producing a 116-kDa band when analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A). However, analysis by native gel electrophoresis shows only limited folding of the motor domain. If the lysate is supplemented with either Unc45a or Unc45b, there is a dramatic increase in radioactivity migrating as a discrete band in the native gel. The position of the discrete band corresponds to the migration of native myosin subfragments in this gel system (not shown). A densitometric scan of the native gel shows that in the absence of Unc45 the bulk of the radioactivity migrates as a series of diffuse bands near the top of the gel, and only a small fraction (<10%) migrates in the position of the native protein (Fig. 1B). The inclusion of Unc45a in the synthesis reaction shifts the bulk of the slowly migrating radioactivity near the top of the gel to the faster migrating discrete band. The level of MD::GFP synthesis is unaffected by addition of the purified Unc45 as shown by SDS-PAGE of the reactions. The increased intensity is not a consequence of increased synthesis or enhanced stability of the MD::GFP synthesized in the supplemented reactions but rather a shift to a more uniform conformation. Analysis of folding reactions by gel filtration chromatography demonstrates the appearance of the discrete band in the native gel coincides with the accumulation of MD::GFP monomers with hydrodynamic properties similar to striated muscle myosin S1, an active proteolytic myosin subfragment (Fig. 1C). The protein in the peak fractions from the Unc45a supplemented reaction corresponds to the faster migrating discrete band detected in the native gel. Finally, this species exhibits ATP-sensitive actin binding activity, confirming that it is indeed the native conformation (Fig. 1D). Therefore, the addition of either Unc45a or Unc45b enhances myosin motor domain folding, and this is readily quantified by native gel electrophoresis. Unc45 Requirement for Myosin Motor Domain Folding—Titration of the MD::GFP folding reaction with both Unc45 isoforms demonstrates that Unc45a enhances folding to a greater extent and at a lower concentration than Unc45b (Fig. 2). This is readily apparent if the concentration dependence of the folding reaction is treated as a simple hyperbolic binding curve. The apparent dissociation constant for Unc45a (KD = 19 nm) is less that half that for Unc45b (KD = 53 nm). The extent of the motor domain folding also is different for the two isoforms. Up to 80% of the radioactivity is converted to the native conformation at saturating concentrations of Unc45a, compared with less than 50% with Unc45b. Folding is essentially complete when Unc45a is included in the reaction because incomplete chains due to internal initiation and premature termination account for much of the remaining 20% of the non-native radioactivity in this assay. Hsp90 has been identified as a chaperone on the myosin maturation pathway in striated muscle, and Unc45a has been shown to interact with Hsp90 (5Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 6Du S.J. Li H. Bian Y. Zhong Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 13Barral J.M. Hutagalung A.H. Brinker A. Hartl F.U. Epstein H.F.

Biol. 2006; 26: 1722-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To determine whether Hsp90 has a role in myosin motor domain folding, the ATPase activity of Hsp90 was specifically inhibited by the ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin (26Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R. Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Inhibition of Hsp90 activity completely blocks the stimulation of motor domain folding by Unc45a and Unc45b (Fig. 3A). Even the basal level of motor domain folding detected in the absence of added Unc45 is inhibited by geldanamycin, indicating all motor domain folding in this assay is Hsp90-dependent. The synthesis and stability of the MD::GFP chimera in the reticulocyte lysate were not affected by geldanamycin; so inhibition of Hsp90 activity is not accelerating motor domain turnover. Furthermore, geldanamycin has no effect on stability of the folded state. These results show that Unc45-enhanced MD::GFP folding is dependent on Hsp90 ATPase activity. Western blots with antibodies to either Unc45a or Unc45b do not reveal detectable levels of endogenous Unc45 in the reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). This suggests that Unc45 might stimulate motor domain folding by accelerating delivery of substrate to Hsp90. Hsp90 is generally considered a late chaperone regulating the maturation of macromolecules and activation of multiprotein complexes (27Zhao R. Houry W.A. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2007; 594: 27-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the preceding experiments, Unc45 was included during the synthesis of the myosin motor domain. To determine the timing of the interaction of Unc45 in the motor domain folding pathway, we separated synthesis from folding by first translating the MD::GFP and then inhibiting protein synthesis before adding the Unc45 (Fig. 3B). The extent of MD::GFP folding was the same whether Unc45 was present during translation or added post-translation. It is apparent that the interaction of Unc45 and Hsp90 with the unfolded motor domain is a late step in the folding pathway. Unc45a Stimulates the Rate of the Folding Reaction—The observations that Unc45a acts after synthesis and that folding can be completely blocked by inhibition of Hsp90 ATPase activity provide the tools needed to examine the kinetics of the folding reaction (Fig. 4). The MD::GFP chimera was synthesized in the absence of Unc45a and the synthesis stopped with cycloheximide. Aliquots of the unfolded MD::GFP were incubated with various concentrations of Unc45a. Time points of the reactions were sampled, and folding was stopped by inhibiting Hsp90 with geldanamycin. The initial rates of the accumulation of the folded MD::GFP were then determined and analyzed. In this assay, Unc45a behaves as an activator of the Hsp90-dependent folding activity. The Kact of Unc45a (33 nm) from the folding kinetics is very similar to the apparent KD (19 nm) determined from the end point titration (Fig. 2). The rate of the MD::GFP folding reaction is accelerated >20-fold at saturating Unc45a concentrations. These data are consistent with a mechanism where Unc45a acts as an activator of Hsp90 folding activity, but it is not clear whether the activation constant reflects the binding interaction between Hsp90 and Unc45a or between Unc45a and the unfolded MD::GFP substrate. To address this question, we analyzed the binding interaction between both isoforms of Unc45 and Hsp90 in solution. Hsp90 was incubated with Unc45a or Unc45b, and the reactions were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 5, A and B). Unc45a and Unc45b both elute from a Superose 6 column in a single symmetric peak at an elution volume consistent with a monomer of ∼100-kDa apparent mass. In contrast, Hsp90 elutes earlier from the column in a broad double peak consistent with its larger dimeric mass (∼180 kDa) and heterogeneous conformation (28Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The formation of a complex between Unc45 and Hsp90 changes the elution profile of the individual components. This is readily apparent for the complex formed by Unc45b and Hsp90 (Fig. 5B). There is a decrease in the Unc45b monomer peak height, an increase in height of the peak eluting in the position of Hsp90, and a sharpening of the peak into a more symmetric shape. This is consistent with the shift of Unc45b into a complex with Hsp90 that has a more compact conformation than the pure Hsp90 dimer. The Unc45a shows considerably less evidence of binding to Hsp90 (Fig. 5A). There are slight shifts in the Hsp90 and Unc45a peaks consistent with a weak binding interaction, but these changes are dramatically less than those observed with Unc45b. Analysis of the integrated density of the bands on SDS-PAGE of the column fractions provides an estimate of the binding stoichiometry and affinity (Fig. 5, C and D). Less than 10% of the Unc45a elutes with the Hsp90, and the Hsp90/Unc45a ratio across the region of overlap is high, consistent with a low binding affinity. In contrast, over 40% of the Unc45b co-elutes with the Hsp90, and the Hsp90/Unc45 ratio in the center of the overlap approaches a value of 2. Because Hsp90 is a dimer, that ratio would correspond to a 1:1 molar complex formed between Hsp90 and Unc45b. Based on the elution data there is significant difference in Hsp90 binding affinity between Unc45a and Unc45b. This is confirmed in a pulldown assay that measures the concentration dependence of Hsp90 binding to immobilized Unc45 isoforms (Fig. 6). The apparent KD value for Hsp90 binding to Unc45b (0.5 μm) is 15-fold stronger than to Unc45a (7.8 μm). So although both co-chaperones enhance the Hsp90-dependent folding reaction, Unc45a and Unc45b differ significantly in Hsp90 binding affinity. In addition, these results show that Unc45a binds Hsp90 over 2 orders of magnitude weaker in the absence of substrate protein (MD::GFP) than the measured Kact (33 nm) for the folding reaction. Finally, is Unc45b the missing muscle-specific factor required for efficient striated myosin motor domain folding? Unc45a and Unc45b are active co-chaperones that enhance Hsp90-dependent folding of the smooth muscle motor domain. However, neither Unc45a nor Unc45b is sufficient to complement the folding of the striated muscle myosin motor domain (Fig. 7). This suggests that other factors not present in the reticulocyte lysate are still required for folding of the striated motor domain. The factor(s) may act before or in concert with the late Unc45/Hsp90 folding components. The striated muscle myosin MD::GFP design used here is correctly folded when expressed in striated muscle (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), so this assay will be a valuable tool to test additional factors isolated from muscle for a role in this more complicated folding pathway. Unc45 Activates an Hsp90-dependent Folding Pathway—We have analyzed the role of the Hsp90 co-chaperone protein Unc45 in myosin folding and demonstrated that a primary activity of Unc45 is to activate the Hsp90-dependent folding of the myosin motor domain. Both vertebrate isoforms of Unc45, the generally expressed Unc45a and striated muscle-specific Unc45b, enhance the de novo folding of a smooth muscle myosin motor domain in a reaction that is dependent on Hsp90 ATPase activity. Selectivity for the smooth muscle myosin substrate and striking differences in Hsp90 binding affinity are demonstrated for the two different Unc45 isoforms. This suggests mechanistic differences in the folding pathways supported by the vertebrate Unc45 isoforms. This conclusion is supported by the observation that, although both isoforms are active in folding the smooth muscle myosin, neither is sufficient for folding the striated myosin motor domain. The Unc45/Hsp90 chaperones act late during motor domain folding after translation termination on a heterogeneous population of folding intermediates that are converted to the native conformation. Unc45a stimulates the rate of motor domain folding over 20-fold with an apparent activation constant of 33 nm. Unc45a might act as an activator of the Hsp90-dependent folding reaction by targeting the motor domain to the chaperone machinery. We do not detect Unc45 protein in the reticulocyte lysate with antibodies to either Unc45a or Unc45b (data not shown). Therefore, the low level of motor domain folding in the unsupplemented lysate corresponds to the basal activity of Hsp90. The complete inhibition of motor domain folding by an Hsp90 ATPase inhibitor confirms this conclusion and is consistent with a mechanism whereby Unc45 facilitates folding by targeting substrate to the chaperone machinery. This result also links Hsp90 for the first time to the maturation of smooth muscle myosin. Functional Differences between the Unc45 Isoforms—The general cell Unc45a isoform shows selectivity for the smooth muscle myosin motor domain with a higher apparent binding affinity and a greater extent of folding in this assay than the muscle-specific isoform. Unc45a is expressed in smooth muscle and was cloned from these cells as SMAP-1 (smooth cell muscle associated protein 1, direct submission GenBank™ accession number AB014736). The selectivity might reflect the co-evolution of the smooth muscle myosin with a cognate co-chaperone. Substrate selectivity adds support to the hypothesis that one function of Unc45 is to target substrate to the general chaperone machinery as a necessary step for efficient motor domain folding. Substrate selectivity is not the only difference between Unc45a and Unc45b. The muscle-specific Unc45b isoform has a significantly higher affinity for Hsp90 than the general Unc45a isoform. In a related study, we have found that the endogenous Unc45b in muscle cytosol, as well as overexpressed recombinant Unc45b, isolated as a complex with Hsp90 (29Srikakulam, R., Liu, L., and Winkelmann, D. A. (2008) PLoS One, in pressGoogle Scholar). Consequently, we were surprised by the striking difference in Hsp90 binding affinity between the two isoforms. The activation constant for Unc45a stimulation of motor domain folding (Kact = 33 nm) is much lower than the apparent binding affinity of Unc45a for Hsp90. The weak binding interaction with Hsp90 suggests that the activation constant might reflect the binding of Unc45a to the unfolded motor domain. Alternatively, both Unc45a and the unfolded motor domain may be required for a high affinity binding interaction with Hsp90. We suspect that this ternary complex is a transient intermediate formed as unfolded substrate is transferred to the chaperone machinery and folded. This aspect of the mechanism clearly needs further work. Nonetheless, these results identify key differences between the two vertebrate Unc45 isoforms. Requirements for Smooth Versus Striated Muscle Myosin II Folding—An even more striking difference is demonstrated between the folding pathway of the smooth and the striated muscle myosin motor domains. Neither Unc45a nor Unc45b is sufficient to promote the folding of the striated muscle myosin motor domain under conditions that support nearly complete folding of the smooth muscle myosin motor domain. The muscle-specific Unc45b is active in folding of the smooth muscle myosin motor domain, so the co-chaperone activity and the correct isoform for folding the striated motor domain are present in the assay. Nonetheless, the striated motor domain is not folded. We have shown that the striated myosin MD::GFP chimera assayed here is correctly folded only when expressed in muscle cells (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). So, other muscle-specific factors in addition to Unc45b are required for efficient folding of striated muscle myosin. Unc45 and Hsp90 are late chaperones acting after translation. Perhaps early muscle-specific chaperones are required for delivery of the striated myosin motor domain in a folding competent conformation to the late chaperone machinery. Unc45b and Hsp90 bind the unfolded striated muscle motor domain synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate, so the conformation present in the lysate is recognized by the late chaperone machinery (29Srikakulam, R., Liu, L., and Winkelmann, D. A. (2008) PLoS One, in pressGoogle Scholar). However, this conformation might be bound but is still not competent for maturation. Alternatively, other factors may be required to regulate the dissociation of the MD/Unc45b/Hsp90 interaction to complete folding. The higher affinity of Unc45b for Hsp90 might reflect a mechanistic requirement for a dissociation factor that is not required for the weaker binding Unc45a isoform. These differences in the folding pathway clearly reflect the difficulty that has been associated with the expression of the striated muscle myosin family in heterologous systems (3Chow D. Srikakulam R. Chen Y. Winkelmann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36799-36807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The assay developed here should assist in searching for missing factors that are necessary to complete the striated muscle myosin folding pathway. Unc45, Hsp90, and Myosin Filament Assembly—Myosin maturation and assembly in striated muscle proceeds through the formation of a transient complex containing partially folded myosin assembled into filaments and associated with Hsp90 and Hsc70 (5Srikakulam R. Winkelmann D.A. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Genetic interactions suggest a fundamental role for Unc45 and Hsp90 in myosin filament assembly. In C. elegans, temperature-sensitive alleles of unc-45 disrupt thick filament assembly in the body wall muscle at nonpermissive temperature (9Venolia L. Waterston R.H. Genetics. 1990; 126: 345-353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Barral J.M. Bauer C.C. Ortiz I. Epstein H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1215-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In the zebrafish embryo the unc45b gene is expressed exclusively in striated muscle (30Wohlgemuth S.L. Crawford B.D. Pilgrim D.B. Dev. Biol. 2007; 303: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Targeted knockdown of Unc45b protein in zebrafish results in paralysis and cardiac dysfunction correlated with a loss of myosin filaments in sarcomeres, consistent with a role for Unc45b in folding of muscle-specific myosin isoforms. A striated muscle-specific knockdown of Hsp90α1 in zebrafish produces a complementary phenotype and is accompanied by an up-regulation of Unc45b expression and decreased myosin stability (6Du S.J. Li H. Bian Y. Zhong Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 7Hawkins T.A. Haramis A.P. Etard C. Prodromou C. Vaughan C.K. Ashworth R. Ray S. Behra M. Holder N. Talbot W.S. Pearl L.H. Strahle U. Wilson S.W. Development (Camb.). 2008; 135: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have shown here that Unc45 is an active component of the chaperone machinery that mediates myosin motor domain folding providing a biochemical mechanism for the interaction between Unc45 and Hsp90 in myosin filament assembly. However, for striated muscle myosin folding additional factors are required to the complete the pathway. In C. elegans, UNC-45 also acts with non-muscle myosin II (NMY-2) during establishment of embryonic polarity, cytokinesis, and germ line cellularization. Depletion of UNC-45 with RNA interference inhibits contractility of the actomyosin cytoskeleton but does not completely block co-localization of the NMY-2 with actin (20Kachur T.M. Audhya A. Pilgrim D.B. Dev. Biol. 2008; 314: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Non-muscle myosin II is closely related to the smooth muscle myosin. We show here that smooth myosin MD::GFP synthesized in the absence of Unc45a can bind actin, but the interaction is ATP-insensitive, a hallmark of an inactive myosin. Furthermore, the conformation heterogeneity of the protein indicates that not only is it inactive, it is partially unfolded. Therefore, maturation of the actin binding activity of MD::GFP correlates with the formation of the native conformation, and this step is Hsp90-dependent and accelerated by Unc45a. The levels of UNC-45 in C. elegans appear to be tightly controlled by ubiquitinylation and regulated protein degradation (31Hoppe T. Cassata G. Barral J.M. Springer W. Hutagalung A.H. Epstein H.F. Baumeister R. Cell. 2004; 118: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that UNC-45 in turn regulates sarcomere assembly through myosin ubiquitinylation and degradation (32Landsverk M.L. Li S. Hutagalung A.H. Najafov A. Hoppe T. Barral J.M. Epstein H.F. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This mechanism is very different from the direct role of Unc45 in myosin folding demonstrated here. Reticulocyte lysate contains the essential ubiquitin-proteasome system necessary for degradation, but we do not see motor domain turnover induced by high concentrations of either vertebrate Unc45 isoform in the lysate even when Hsp90 activity is inhibited (33Hoffman L. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22362-22368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So, although myosin levels or turnover also might be regulated by Unc45, a primary activity is that of a co-chaperone in Hsp90-mediated myosin motor domain folding.

We have investigated the kinetics of repair of UVA- and UVB-induced DNA lesions in relation to mutagenicity in transgenic mouse fibroblasts irradiated with equilethal doses of UVA and UVB in comparison to simulated-sunlight UV (SSL). We have also analyzed mutagenesis-derived carcinogenesis in sunlight-associated human skin cancers by compiling the published data on mutation types found in crucial genes in nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers. Here, we demonstrate a resistance to repair of UVB-induced cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine-dimers (CPDs) together with rapid removal of UVA-induced oxidized purines in the genome overall and in the cII transgene of SSL-irradiated cells. The spectra of mutation induced by both UVB and SSL irradiation in this experimental system are characterized by significant increases in relative frequency of C-->T transitions at dipyrimidines, which are the established signature mutation of CPDs. This type of mutation is also the predominant mutation found in human nonmelanoma and melanoma tumor samples in the TP53, CDKN2, PTCH, and protein kinase genes. The prevailing role of UVB over UVA in solar mutagenesis in our test system can be ascribed to different kinetics of repair for lesions induced by the respective UV irradiation."

These conditions affect many tissues, are painful, and are difficult to treat. In this study using cornea as a model, we demonstrate the importance of trefoil factor 3 (TFF3, also known as intestinal trefoil factor) in re-epithelialization of wounds. In two different models of corneal wound healing, alkali- and laser-induced corneal wounding, we analyzed the wound healing process in in vivo as well as in combined in vivo/in vitro model in wild type (Tff3(+)(/)(+)) and Tff3-deficient (Tff3(-)(/)(-)) mice. Furthermore, we topically applied different concentrations of recombinant human TFF3 (rTFF3) peptide on the wounded cornea to determine the efficacy of rTFF3 on corneal wound healing. We found that Tff3 peptide is not expressed in intact corneal epithelium, but its expression is extensively up-regulated after epithelial injury. Re-epithelialization of corneal wounds in Tff3(-/-) mice is significantly prolonged in comparison to Tff3(+/+) mice. In addition, exogenous application of rTFF3 to the alkali-induced corneal wounds accelerates significantly in in vivo and in combined in vivo/in vitro model wound healing in Tff3(+/+) and Tff3(-/-) mice. These findings reveal a pivotal role for Tff3 in corneal wound healing mechanism and have broad implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for treating nonhealing wounds."

There are four family members in mammals, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2, as well as homologues in birds, fish, and insects (1Ihle J.N. Kerr I.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 69-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Based on their primary structure, members of the JAK family are characterized by the presence of seven regions of conserved homology, denoted JAK homology (JH) domains JH1–JH7 (2Harpur A.G. Andres A.C. Ziemiecki A. Aston R.R. Wilks A.F. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1347-1353PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal JH7–JH5 domains make up the FERM domain, critical for the association of JAKs to their receptors and in some cases for receptor cell-surface localization (3Huang L.J.

The carboxyl terminus contains the pseudokinase and kinase domains, JH2 and JH1, respectively. The kinase domain of JAK2 consists of a nucleotide-binding loop, a catalytic loop, and an activation loop that houses the two autophosphorylation sites, Tyr-1007 and Tyr-1008, of which Tyr-1007 is crucial for activation (7Feng J. Witthuhn B.A. Matsuda T. Kohlhuber F. Kerr I.M. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2497-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The JAK2 JH2 domain displays a similar architecture to JH1 but lacks several critical residues characteristic of a functional kinase, such as the conserved aspartic acid residue involved in the phosphotransfer reaction and the third glycine in the GXGXXG motif of the nucleotide-binding loop (8Wilks A.F.

Efforts to understand the details of JAK2 V617F activation have been hampered by the lack of a full three-dimensional structure for any Janus kinase. Functional studies had previously suggested an inhibitory effect of the pseudokinase domain on the kinase domain of JAK2 (14Saharinen P. Silvennoinen O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47954-47963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Structural predictions pointed to the β4–β5 loop of JH2 as a requirement for inhibition (15Lindauer K. Loerting T. Liedl K.R. Kroemer R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Consequently, it was proposed that the V617F mutation diminishes some of this inhibition and induces constitutive JAK2 V617F activity (16Staerk J. Kallin A. Demoulin J.-B. Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41893-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the homologous V617F mutations also activate JAK1 and TYK2, the other Janus kinases with conserved valine residues at this position (16Staerk J. Kallin A. Demoulin J.-B. Vainchenker W. Constantinescu S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41893-41899Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Physiologically, the signaling cascade transduced by JAK2 upon ligand binding to cytokine receptors, such as the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), is kept in check by activation of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. For example, SOCS1 and SOCS3 bind to the catalytic groove of JAK2 through their kinase inhibitory region, thus inhibiting catalytic activity and marking the kinase for ubiquitination and degradation (17Yoshimura A. Nishinakamura H. Matsumura Y. Hanada T. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2005; 7: 100-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This physiologic negative regulation was shown to be impaired for the JAK2 V617F mutant. Instead of down-modulating JAK2 V617F, SOCS3 protein actually enhanced its activity, leading to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 itself, which impairs its ability to target the kinase for degradation (18Hookham M.B. Elliott J. Suessmuth Y. Staerk J. Ward A.C. Vainchenker W. Percy M.J. McMullin M.F. Constantinescu S.N. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2007; 109: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Here we utilized a random mutagenesis approach to screen all other possible 18 mutations at position 617 of JAK2 and address the question of why we only detect the Val to Phe mutation in patients. We identified four novel mutants that were able to support cytokine-independent growth of Ba/F3 cells expressing the erythropoietin (Epo) receptor. Only one mutant, JAK2 V617W, was comparable in signaling strength with JAK2 V617F, and only this mutant could phosphorylate and stabilize SOCS3, in a similar manner to JAK2 V617F. Furthermore, mice reconstituted with bone marrow cells transduced with JAK2 V617W displayed a myeloproliferative disease predominating on both erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. Based on our results on the novel active JAK2 mutants, we propose a model for the pathologic activation of JAK2 by the V617F mutation. We suggest that although JAK2 V617W would most probably be pathogenic in patients, it may not occur naturally due to the necessity of three base pair changes to obtain the substitution of valine to tryptophan. Generation of JAK Mutants—Several mutagenesis reactions with degenerate primers were carried out on murine JAK2 WT with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) until the 19 V617X mutants (where X is any amino acid) were obtained.

When performing the assay on stably transduced sorted or selected the Ba/F3-EpoR cells (expressing each JAK2 mutant), cells were starved overnight in RPMI medium with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and electroporated the next day with the pGRR5 and pRLTK luciferase reporters. The cells were subsequently cultured for 2 h and lysed in 100 μl1× passive lysis buffer, and their luminescence was recorded. In Vivo Reconstitution of Mice—Murine WT or V617W JAK2 cDNAs were cloned in pMEGIX. Virus was produced in 293 Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen cells. Bone marrow cells were collected from C57BL/6J mice 4 days after 5-fluorouracil treatment, infected with virus, and injected intravenously into lethally irradiated mice. Hematocrit levels were determined 4 weeks after transplantation. Peripheral blood cell counts were recorded using a Melet-Schloesing Laboratories cell counter, and blood smears were analyzed after May-Grünewald-Giemsa staining. Histopathological analyses were performed after 2–4 months. Paraffin-embedded sternums and spleens were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Giemsa. Reticulin fibers were revealed by silver staining according to the Gordon Sweet method (32Gordon H. Sweet H.H. Am. J. Pathol. 1936; 12: 545-547Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and collagen was revealed by trichrome staining. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitations—2.5 × 106 Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing each murine or human JAK2 mutant were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in 150 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, boiled for 10 min, and centrifuged for 3 min at 20,000 × g. A volume equivalent to ∼250,000 cells was loaded on 10% Tris-glycine precast gels (Invitrogen). After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes and blocking in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline-Tween, immunoblotting was performed overnight at 4 °C with rabbit antiphospho-JAK2 (Tyr-1007/1008) or rabbit antiphospho-STAT5 A/B (Tyr-694) (both from Cell Signaling Technology) in a solution of 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline-Tween with a 1:1000 antibody dilution. Secondary anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase antibodies (GE Healthcare) were used in a 1:10,000 dilution in 5% milk, Tris-buffered saline-Tween. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with anti-JAK2 (24B11) and anti-STAT5, respectively (both from Cell Signaling Technology) using the same dilutions and secondary antibodies as for their phospho counterparts (see Figs. 2C and 3A). Alternatively (see Fig. 1, B and C), 107 Ba/F3-EpoR cells were harvested, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in cold lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 + 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Upon incubation on ice for 30 min and spinning for 20 min at 20,000 × g and 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with an appropriate volume of 2× Laemmli and boiled, and 40 μg of total protein was loaded on NuPage 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen). Transfer on nitrocellulose membranes was carried out with the iBlot™ dry blotting system (Invitrogen). Membranes were blocked in 3% milk, phosphate-buffered saline and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-JAK2 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in a 1:100 dilution. Separately, Ba/F3 and 293T cells were lysed with radioimmune precipitation buffer (22Zapata J.M. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology) or anti-SOCS3 clone 008 (Fusion Antibodies). Antiphospho-tyrosine clone 4G10, anti-JAK2 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-FLAG M2 (Sigma-Aldrich), or anti-SOCS3 clone 008 was used to probe the Western blots.FIGURE 3JAK2 V617W is highly active and hyperphosphorylates SOCS3. A, selected Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing each active human JAK2 Val-617 mutant were lysed and probed with anti-pJAK2 and anti-JAK2 antibodies to determine total levels of the protein. For the JAK2 WT, we used sorted cells as JAK2 WT does not induce autonomous growth. JAK2V617W showed a significant level of pJAK2. The other mutants showed only slight increases of pJAK2. Shown is one of three independent experiments. B, 293T cells were transfected with EpoR and SOCS3 alone or in combination with murine JAK2 WT, V617F, V617C, V617L, V617M, and V617W. Whole-cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-SOCS3 clone 008 antibody and immunoblotted (IB) with antiphospho-tyrosine (pY) (4G10) antibodies.

A, sorted Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing JAK2 V617F, V617I, V617L, V617M, V617W, and to a minor degree, V617C, were able to proliferate in a medium without cytokines over a period of 7 days. Cell numbers (average of triplicates ± S.D.) were counted at the indicated time points. One representative experiment is shown out of three independent experiments. Parental Ba/F3-EpoR cells, as well as cells expressing JAK2 WT, were not able to survive under the same conditions. B, an increase in the levels of active JAK2 V617X mutated proteins is observed once the cells expressing the activating mutations have acquired cytokine-independence. This increase is not so prominent in JAK2 V617W, probably due to the strength of this mutation. C, sorted Ba/F3-EpoR cells stably express each of the JAK2 V617X non-activating mutants.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The V617F Mutation Is Only One of Several Mutations at Position Val-617 That Can Lead to Constitutive Signaling by JAK2—The V617F mutation in JAK2 found in PV and other myeloproliferative disorders replaces an aliphatic Val residue with a bulky aromatic Phe residue. This substitution in the pseudokinase domain induces constitutive activity of the kinase presumably by eliminating the negative regulation of the JH2 domain on the JH1 (15Lindauer K. Loerting T. Liedl K.R. Kroemer R.T. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The question we asked was whether any of the other 18 natural amino acids could induce a similar effect as V617F when substituted at position 617. Using random mutagenesis with degenerate primers, we generated constructs containing each of the 20 natural amino acids at position 617 of murine JAK2 and cloned them into the bicistronic vector, pMX-IRES-GFP. 293T-derived BOSC cells were used to produce retroviral supernatants that were subsequently utilized to infect murine Ba/F3 cells expressing the Epo receptor. The cells were sorted for similar GFP levels 72 h later. Proliferation of sorted Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing the 20 JAK2 mutants was monitored over a period of 7 days, and the mutants able to grow in the absence of cytokines were selected and counted. JAK2 mutants V617I, V617L, V617M, and V617W, in addition to the V617F positive control, were able to render Ba/F3-EpoR cells autonomous (selected) under these conditions (Fig. 1A). V617C could also eventually induce autonomous growth, but this required a longer delay, and growth was established slowly, suggesting that further selection was required to obtain complete cytokine independence, relative to the other four mutants. The cells expressing the other 13 mutants and the WT JAK2 were unable to proliferate in the absence of growth factors (data not shown), suggesting that the selected mutants were constitutively active. The V617W mutant reproducibly exhibited the shortest growth lag time of all the mutants, proliferating faster than the V617F mutant (Fig. 1A). Lysates were prepared after cell sorting and subsequently after selection of these sorted cells for autonomous growth, and the levels of JAK2 protein were compared for each mutated JAK2 in these two conditions. In all cases except V617W, and to a lesser extent V617F, selection for autonomous growth after cell sorting led to an increase in protein levels of the respective JAK2 V617X mutant (Fig. 1B). The JAK2 V617X mutants that could not support cytokine-independent growth were stably expressed in sorted Ba/F3-EpoR cells at levels similar to WT (Fig. 1C). We quantified the STAT5 transcriptional activity of the 20 mutants by dual luciferase assays in JAK2- and STAT5-deficient γ-2A fibrosarcoma cells. For each sample, we transfected cDNAs coding for the individual JAK2 mutant, STAT5A, the general STAT reporter pGRR5-Luc (21Dumoutier L. Van Roost E. Colau D. Renauld J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10144-10149Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar), and the luciferase reporter pRLTK-Luc as an internal control. Generally, the mutants that could proliferate in the absence of cytokines were able to induce much higher STAT5 transcriptional activity than WT (Fig. 2A). V617I, V617L, and V617M induced a STAT5 activity five times higher than WT, whereas V617W enhanced STAT5 activity almost 10 times and approximately double that of V617F. On the other hand, the V617C mutant induced a STAT5 transcriptional activity comparable with the level induced by overexpressed WT JAK2. This mutant was also quite weak in promoting autonomous growth, which required a long lag period (Fig. 1A). Additionally, we have performed the luciferase assays by transfecting the cDNA coding for STAT5B instead of STAT5A and noticed similar results (supplemental Fig. 1). We also measured the activity of V617C with pLHRE-Luc, a luciferase reporter that responds preferentially to STAT5 (24Sotiropoulos A. Moutoussamy S. Renaudie F. Clauss M. Kayser C. Gouilleux F. Kelly P.A. Finidori J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 998-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and pGL3bPpr2-Luc (25Eyckerman S. Waelput W. Verhee A. Broekaert D. Vandekerckhove J. Tavernier J. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1999; 10: 549-556PubMed Google Scholar), a reporter that responds to STAT3, and still could not detect a transcriptional level higher than WT (data not shown), suggesting either a very low or a very transient activity of V617C. We also carried out luciferase assays to study STAT transcriptional activation directly in the Ba/F3-EpoR cells stably expressing each mutant, which were growing autonomously (without cytokines), which we denote as “selected.” Cells were washed, incubated without serum overnight, and electroporated with the pGRR5 and pRLTK reporters. As a negative control, we used sorted Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing WT JAK2. Selected cells expressing the V617I, V617L, V617M, and V617W mutants all displayed STAT5 transcriptional activity well over that of WT (Fig. 2B). We then performed a Western blot on these cells and probed them with antiphospho-STAT5 (STAT5 phosphorylated at tyrosine 694) and anti-STAT5 antibodies. The STAT5 activity observed in the luciferase assay was confirmed in the Western blot as the V617W mutant exhibited a high pSTAT5 level, comparable with V617F. V617I, V617L, and V617M all demonstrated a phospho-STAT5 level higher than WT but lower than V617F and V617W (Fig. 2C). The same samples were also probed with anti-JAK2 antibodies. The lower levels of JAK2 V617F and especially of V617W may reflect their strength of signaling as these mutants do not require high protein levels for activity (Fig. 2C). This is consistent with the levels of V617F and V617W we observe in Fig. 1B. We were interested in determining whether the activating mutations at position 617 of murine JAK2 would have similar effects in human JAK2. We generated human JAK2 V617F, V617I, V617L, V617M, V617W, and V617C mutants through site-directed mutagenesis. A luciferase assay in selected Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing the WT and mutant human JAK2 constructs revealed a similar activity as in the luciferase assay of selected murine cells, with notably low STAT5-dependent transcriptional activity induced by the human JAK2 V617C, which was also much weaker in inducing autonomous growth (data not shown). To further compare the activities of the human JAK2 mutants, we performed a Western blot on Ba/F3-EpoR cells expressing each human JAK2 Val-617 mutant, previously selected for autonomous growth. To monitor activation, we used antibodies that specifically detect the phospho-tyrosines that are required for activation of JAK2 (Tyr-1007). The phospho-JAK2 levels were also significantly higher in V617W, similar to V617F. The pJAK2 levels of V617C, V617I, and V617L mirrored the luciferase assay results, pointing to these mutants being weaker than V617F and V617W (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis with antiphospho-Tyr-694 of STAT5 confirmed the luciferase results as the active mutations displayed a level of STAT5 phosphorylation higher than WT (data not shown). JAK2 V617W Induces Strong Tyrosine Phosphorylation of SOCS3— We have previously shown that the V617F mutant not only escapes negative regulation by SOCS3 but that SOCS3 may even enhance its phosphorylation, constitutive activity, and ability to promote proliferation. Rather than being degraded, SOCS3 is phosphorylated and stabilized in the presence of JAK2 V617F (18Hookham M.B. Elliott J. Suessmuth Y. Staerk J. Ward A.C. Vainchenker W. Percy M.J. McMullin M.F. Constantinescu S.N. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2007; 109: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We wanted to test the effect of SOCS3 on the other active murine JAK2 V617X mutants. In 293T cells transiently transfected with each mutant, we determined that only JAK2 V617F and JAK2 V617W strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 (Fig. 3B and supplemental Fig. 2). SOCS3 actually stabilized the phosphorylated form of JAK2 V617F, and to a lesser extent that of JAK2 V617W, but not that of the other mutants. These results are in agreement with those previously reported for JAK2 V617F (18Hookham M.B. Elliott J. Suessmuth Y. Staerk J. Ward A.C. Vainchenker W. Percy M.J. McMullin M.F. Constantinescu S.N. Johnston J.A. Blood. 2007; 109: 4924-4929Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the one mutant that appears to mimic the effects of JAK2 V617F is V617W as it is the strongest in various biologic or signaling assays and overcomes inhibition by SOCS3. That is the reason why we examined the effects of this mutant in vivo. JAK2 V617W Induces a Myeloproliferative Disease Predominating on Erythroid and Megakaryocytic Lineages in Mice—To examine the effect of the V617W mutation in vivo, we reconstituted mice with this mutant and assessed their phenotype 4 weeks after transplantation. The mice expressing JAK2 V617W developed erythrocytosis, with a hematocrit >50% (Fig. 4A). This phenotype, reminiscent of the one present in PV, was similar to the one obtained in mice with the V617F mutation (9James C. Ugo V. Le Couedic J.P. Staerk J. Delhommeau F. Lacout C. Garcon L.

Previously, numerous pharmacological studies using rapamycin suggested that mTOR has an important role in regulating cardiac hypertrophic growth. To further investigate this assumption, we have generated two lines of cardiac specific mTOR transgenic mice, kinase-dead (kd) mTOR and constitutively active (ca) mTOR, using α-myosin heavy chain promoter. α-Myosin heavy chain (αMHC)-mTORkd mice had a near complete inhibition of p70 S6k and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, whereas αMHC-mTORca had a significant increase in p70 S6k and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Although the cardiac function of αMHC-mTORkd mice was significantly altered, the cardiac morphology of these transgenic mice was normal. The cardiac hypertrophic growth in response to physiological and pathological stimuli was not different in αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice when compared with that of nontransgenic littermates. These findings suggest that the mTOR-mediated signaling pathway is not essential to cardiac hypertrophic growth but is involved in regulating cardiac function. Additional analysis of cardiac responses to fasting-refeeding or acute insulin administration indicated that αMHC-mTORkd mice had a largely impaired physiological response to nutrient energy supply and insulin stimulation.

The generation of a normal sized organ is achieved by the control of cell number and cell size. Similarly, the size of the heart is regulated by hyperplastic growth (increase of cell number) and hypertrophic growth (increase of cell size). Normal cardiomyocyte proliferation and hypertrophic growth have a critical role in postnatal cardiac functions (1Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Chen H. Yong W. Ren S. Shen W. He Y. Cox K.A. Zhu W. Li W. Soonpaa M. Payne R.M. Franco D. Field L.J. Rosen V. Wang Y. Shou W. J.

The molecular mechanism of regulating the size of cardiomyocytes remains as one of the major research interests in molecular cardiology. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 4The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; αMHC, α-myosin heavy chain; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ca, constitutively active; kd, kinase-dead; ECG, electrocardiogram; PE, phenylephrine; ET-1, endothelin; 4E-BP, eIF4E-binding protein. 4The abbreviations used are: mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; eIF, eukaryotic initiation factor; αMHC, α-myosin heavy chain; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; ca, constitutively active; kd, kinase-dead; ECG, electrocardiogram; PE, phenylephrine; ET-1, endothelin; 4E-BP, eIF4E-binding protein. is a large (289 kDa) and evolutionarily conserved member of phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase family. mTOR appears to have multiple biological functions. The most well characterized area is its control of cellular growth and proliferation via the regulation of protein translational machinery. Under most circumstances, protein synthesis is regulated by translation initiation, a complex process in which mRNA template, the ribosome, and aminoacylated tRNA are assembled in a correct configuration. The assembly of this translational machinery requires a group of proteins called eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs). An important finding over the past decade is that mTOR and its mediated signaling pathway regulate the assembly of the translational machinery. In mammalian cells, mTOR is associated with two additional proteins, Raptor and mLST8/GβL, to form complex 1 (mTORC1). Raptor and mLST8/GβL are homologues of the yeast KOG1p and LST8p, respectively (3Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). Via Raptor, mTOR interacts with and phosphorylates p70 S6k and eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs), including 4E-BP1, 4E-BP2, and 4E-BP3, and thereby regulating protein synthesis and cell growth (4Dufner A. Thomas G. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 5Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). p70 S6k directly phosphorylates the 40 S ribosomal protein S6. Increased S6 phosphorylation enhances the translation of transcripts with 5′-terminal oligopyrimidine sequences (6Jefferies H.B. Fumagalli S. Dennis P.B. Reinhard C. Pearson R.B. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3693-3704Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). 4E-BP1 can be phosphorylated at multiple sites after stimulation, and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 results in its dissociation from eIF4E, thereby allowing eIF4E to assemble with eIF4G, facilitating the recruitment of other translation initiation factors to form the eIF4F complex and initiate cap-dependent translation (5Gingras A.C. Raught B. Sonenberg N. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 807-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). In addition to the mediation of mitogenic signals (7Fang Y. Vilella-Bach M. Bachmann R. Flanigan A.

Heitman J. Cardenas M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9583-9586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar) and energy status (11Dennis P.B. Jaeschke A. Saitoh M. Fowler B. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Science. 2001; 294: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that mTOR also exists in a second signaling complex with mLST8/GβL and a protein termed Rictor, rather than Raptor. This second mTOR complex (mTORC2), unlike mTORC1, is rapamycin-resistant and functions as an Akt kinase (12Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40406-40416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 13Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5081) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the function of mTORC2 is regulated by Sin1 (14Yang Q. Inoki K. Ikenoue T. Guan K.L. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 2820-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Sin1 appeared to be required for mTORC2 kinase activity in phosphorylating Akt on Ser-473 and to facilitate the interaction between Rictor and mTOR. A key feature for cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth is the significant increase of protein synthesis. Previous pharmacological studies using rapamycin demonstrated a potential use of rapamycin in inhibiting the cardiomyocyte hypertrophic response and the activation of protein synthesis induced by phenylephrine (PE) (15Boluyt M.O. Zheng J.S. Younes A. Long X. O'Neill L. Silverman H. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), endothelin (ET-1) (16Wang L. Proud C.G. Circ.

Physiol. 2000; 278: H1056-H1068Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in cultured cardiomyocytes. However, the results derived from in vivo experiments were inconsistent. Several studies demonstrated that rapamycin could attenuate or regress pressure overload- and constitutively active Akt-induced cardiac hypertrophy (16Wang L. Proud C.G. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 19Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Circulation. 2003; 107: 1664-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), suggesting that mTOR is an important regulator for cardiac hypertrophy. However, a number of other lines of evidence argued against the importance of mTOR in cardiac hypertrophic growth. Treatment of mice from 3 to 4 weeks of age with rapamycin (4 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased p70 S6k kinase activity, but the treatment did not suppress postnatal cardiac growth when compared with mice treated with vehicle (19Shioi T.

The ablation of p70 S6k (S6k1) and p54 S6k (S6k2), which was believed to be regulated by mTOR, had no impact on the development of pathological, physiological, insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor-mediated, and PI3K-mediated cardiac hypertrophy (21McMullen J.R.

To further examine the role of mTOR in cardiac hypertrophic growth, we generated two lines of transgenic mice expressing constitutively active (ca) or kinase-dead (kd) mutant mTOR exclusively in myocardium. Our results showed that cardiac specific overexpression of αMHC-mTORca or αMHC-mTORkd mutant proteins by 4–6-fold led to significant alterations in mTOR-mediated signaling. αMHC-mTORkd mice had a near complete inhibition of p70 S6k and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, whereas αMHC-mTORca had a significant increase in p70 S6k and 4EBP1 phosphorylation. Interestingly, the cardiac morphology of these transgenic mice was normal. The cardiac hypertrophic growth of αMHC-mTORkd transgenic mice to physiological and pathological stimuli was not different from that of nontransgenic littermates. However, the cardiac function of αMHC-mTORkd mice was significantly altered. These findings suggest that mTOR-mediated signaling pathway is not essential to cardiac hypertrophic growth but is involved in regulating cardiac function. Additional analysis of cardiac responses to feeding or acute insulin administration indicated that αMHC-mTORkd mice had a largely impaired physiological response to nutrient energy supply and insulin stimulation, which might explain altered cardiac functions in αMHC-mTORkd mice. mTOR Mutants—pcDNA3/mTOR eukaryotic expression plasmids encoding kinase-dead (D2338A) or constitutively active (deletion of amino acid residues 2430–2450) rat mTOR were generated previously (9Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of the mutant proteins was confirmed by transient transfection into C2C12 cells, followed by Western blot analysis. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The αMHC promoter drives transgenes to express exclusively in cardiac myocytes and has been used extensively in transgenic studies. To generate mTORkd and mTORca cardiac specific transgenic mice, we placed an αMHC promoter at the 5′ end of mTOR mutant cDNAs. To distinguish transgenic mTOR from endogenous mTOR, AU1 tag was placed at the 5′ end of mTOR cDNA (Fig. 1A). Transgenic DNAs were microinjected into zygotes by standard methodology as described previously (23Pashmforoush M. Lu J.T. Chen H. Amand T.S. Kondo R. Pradervand S. Evans S.M. Clark B. Feramisco J.R. Giles W. Ho S.Y. Benson D.W. Silberbach M. Shou W. Chien K.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 373-386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Eight independently derived founders for αMHC-mTORkd and six founders for αMHC-mTORca were produced. To minimize gene silencing because of genomic DNA methylation, transgenic mouse lines were maintained in DBA/2J background (back-crossed for at least 7 generations). All animal experiments were in strict compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines within an American Association for Laboratory Animal Care certified facility, and the study protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Histological Analysis—Heart samples were harvested, fixed, sectioned, stained with hematoxylin and eosin for cardiac histology and Masson's trichrome for potential cardiac fibrosis, and subjected to in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses as described previously (24Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C. Haneline L.S. Franco D. Shou W. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 2219-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Morphometric Measurement of Isolated Cardiomyocytes— Cardiomyocytes were enzymatically dissociated from the heart with 0.17% type I collagenase (Worthington) and stained with Hoechst to demonstrate nuclei. Only typical rod-shaped cardiomyocytes were included in the morphometric measurement. Using ImagePro plus 5.1 software, the long axis, short axis, and cell area were measured and compared between transgenic and control mice. To count the total number of cardiomyocytes in adult hearts, formalin-fixed hearts (the atria were removed) were digested with 50% KOH for 24 h (25Gerdes A.M. Onodera T. Tamura T. Said S. Bohlmeyer T.J. Abraham W.T. Bristow M.R. J. Card. Fail. 1998; 4: 343-348Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). After careful washing with phosphate-buffered saline, rod-shaped cells were counted using a hemocytometer. Echocardiogram and Electrocardiogram (ECG) Recording— Transthoracic echocardiograms were performed as described previously (26Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) under 1.5–2.0% isoflurane. Two-dimensional short-axis images were obtained using a high-resolution Vevo 770 Imaging System (Visualsonics Inc., Toronto, Canada) equipped with a 35-MHz scan probe. Left ventricular chamber dimension and wall thickness at systolic and diastolic phases were measured from M-mode recording. Heart rate was calculated from simultaneous electrocardiogram recording. Left ventricular volume, fractional shortening, and ejection fraction were calculated using the Vevo Analysis program as described (26Liao P. Georgakopoulos D. Kovacs A. Zheng M. Lerner D. Pu H. Saffitz J. Chien K. Xiao R.P. Kass D.A. Wang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12283-12288Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For ECG recording, mice were anesthetized with 4% isoflurane before placing the electrodes. With continuous 2% isoflurane through a face mask, three subdermal needle electrodes (model F-E2, Grass Technologies, West Warwick, RI) were impaled in both the front legs and the left rear leg, where the left front served as the positive input, the right front as the negative input, and the left rear leg as the reference to the isolated biological amplifier (ISO-Dam, World Precision Instruments Inc, Sarasota, FL). The gain was set at 1000, and the filters were set at 0.1 Hz for the low filter and 1 kHz for the high filter, respectively. The base line was adjusted to zero. The ECG was then sampled at 2 kHz and digitized using a 16-bit data acquisition card (DAQCard-AI-16XE-50 National Instruments, Austin, TX) under the control of a custom-written program in Lab-Windows/CVI (National Instruments, Austin, TX). The ECG was displayed in real time and was saved for analysis. ECG traces were further filtered with an 8th order Butterworth filter (0.5–300 Hz) and plotted in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Swimming Training—The protocol was as described previously (2Chen H. Yong W. Ren S. Shen W. He Y. Cox K.A. Zhu W. Li W. Soonpaa M. Payne R.M. Franco D. Field L.J. Rosen V. Wang Y. Shou W. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27481-27491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, 8-week-old male mice weighing 15–20 g were made to swim in tanks with a surface area of 225 cm2 and a depth of 15 cm and water temperature of 30–32 °C. Animals were initially exercised for 20 min, twice daily, and the duration of exercise was increased in 10-min increments daily, reaching 90 min, twice daily, by the end of the 2nd week. The duration of exercise was maintained until the end of the study (4 weeks). At the end of the study, the animals were sacrificed, and their heart weights and body weights were determined. Isoproterenol Treatment Using Osmotic Pumps—Three-month-old male αMHC-mTORkd mice and their nontransgenic siblings were treated with the β-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, using Alzet osmotic mini-pumps (7-day infusion, model 2001, flow rate of 1 μl/h, 0.028 g/ml isoproterenol dissolved in saline) as described previously (28Soonpaa M.H. Field L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H1439-H1445PubMed Google Scholar). Insulin, Fasting, and Refeeding Study—Eight-week-old male mice were used in these studies. The animals were first fasted for 18 h, followed by refeeding (simply reintroducing chow to the cage), or a single intraperitoneal injection of insulin (2 IU/kg) (pork insulin, Lilly). Sixty minutes after insulin injection, the animals were sacrificed, and heart and skeletal muscle samples were harvested. The tissue samples were briefly rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Western Blotting—The heart and skeletal muscle samples were homogenized, and Western blotting was performed as described (29Shen W.H. Boyle D.W. Wisniowski P. Bade A. Liechty E.A. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 185: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, Akt, eIF4G, p70 S6k, and S6 at designated sites was measured similarly except that phospho-specific antibodies (all from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA) were used. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6k was also determined by viewing the changes of the migration rate of the proteins on SDS-PAGE. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70 S6k retarded the protein migration rate on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Consequently, when protein extract is subjected to SDS-PAGE, multiple electrophoretic forms are resolved, with increased phosphorylation corresponding to decreased electrophoretic mobility. In addition, association of 4E-BP1 with eIF4E was assessed by measuring the amount of 4E-BP1 recovered from eIF4E extraction as described (29Shen W.H. Boyle D.W. Wisniowski P. Bade A. Liechty E.A. J. Endocrinol. 2005; 185: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Statistics—Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. Densitometry data were normalized to nontransgenic littermate controls on the same blot. Differences between the groups were compared by using the Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Generation of αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca Transgenic Mice—To study the impact of mTORkd and mTORca on postnatal cardiac growth and function, we generated αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice (Fig. 1A). The cardiomyocyte specific αMHC promoter has a transient burst of activity in embryonic heart between E9.5 and 10.5 and is reactivated during early postnatal life and remains persistently high into adulthood (30Gulick J. Subramaniam A. Neumann J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9180-9185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eight transgenic founders carrying the αMHC-mTORkd transgene and six transgenic founders carrying the αMHC-mTORca transgene were generated. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blotting analysis confirmed cardiac overexpression of mTOR transgenes. These transgenic mice appear to have normal embryonic cardiac development and normal life span (survive over 12 months of age). Detailed characterization of αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice was performed on the transgenic lines with highest transgenic expression level. Fig. 1B represents the use of anti-AU1 and anti-mTOR antibodies in determining the level of expression in αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca mice. Western blots showed that these transgenic mTORs (mTORkd and mTORca) were expressed 4–6-fold higher in transgenic mouse hearts (Fig. 1B). Altered mTOR-Mediated Signaling in αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca Transgenic Hearts—It has been demonstrated previously in cultured cells that a point mutation at aspartic acid residue 2338 (D2338A) prevented mTOR autophosphorylation and mTOR kinase activity (31Brunn G.J. Hudson C.C. Sekulic A. Williams J.M. Hosoi H. Houghton P.J. Lawrence Jr., J.C. Abraham R.T. Science. 1997; 277: 99-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and that an mTOR mutant lacking amino acid residues 2430–2450 constantly displayed an elevated level of protein kinase activity relative to full-length mTOR wild type (9Sekulic A. Hudson C.C. Homme J.L. Yin P. Otterness D.M. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3504-3513PubMed Google Scholar). To confirm this in transgenic hearts, we measured the phosphorylation levels of the ribosomal proteins S6 and 4E-BP1, two of the well established mTORC1-mediated downstream targets, in the hearts of αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice. As shown in Fig. 1B, the level of S6 phosphorylation decreased to almost an undetectable level in αMHC-mTORkd heart but increased by 8-fold in αMHC-mTORca heart. Similarly, the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was dramatically reduced in αMHC-mTORkd heart, but was significantly increased in αMHC-mTORca heart as compared with nontransgenic littermate control hearts. In nontransgenic mice, 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, expressed as percentage of the γ form, was about 50%. This figure dropped to 20% in the heart of αMHC-mTORkd hearts and increased to 85% in the αMHC-mTORca hearts. These experiments indicate that mTOR-mediated signaling via mTORC1 is altered in the heart of αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice. To determine whether overexpression of mTORkd and mTORca would also have impact on Akt phosphorylation, an event could be potentially mediated through mTORC2 (13Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5081) Google Scholar), we performed Western blot analysis using specific antibody against pAkt-Ser-473. Our results showed that the level of Akt phosphorylation was not altered in the hearts of either αMHC-mTORkd or αMHC-mTORca mice (Fig. 1B). Taken together, our data suggested that overexpression of mTORkd or mTORca in the heart affected the mTORC1-mediated pathway but not the level of Akt phosphorylation. Altered Cardiac Function but No Morphological Defect in αMHC-mTORkd Mice—Despite clear alterations in mTOR-mediated signaling in αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic hearts, we failed to find any visible abnormal morphological and histological alteration in the size of the hearts. First, we compared heart weight, body weight, and the ratio of heart weight to body weight in αMHC-mTORkd, αMHC-mTORca, and nontransgenic littermate controls at 1, 3, and 5 months of age. There was no evidence of either an increase or decrease in heart weight and size in αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice (Fig. 2A). Histological analysis did not demonstrate that αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic mice developed any significant cardiac hypertrophy, atrophy, cardiac fibrosis, or myocyte disarray, indicating that overexpression of either mTORkd or mTORca did not assert a large impact on cardiac growth under normal physiological conditions (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, we also used [3H]thymidine labeling to analyze the cell cycle activity of the transgenic heart. There was no abnormal cell cycle activity observed in αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic hearts (data not shown). In addition, we measured cell size of isolated cardiomyocytes from αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic and nontransgenic control mice and confirmed at cellular level that there was no alteration in cell size in both transgenic hearts (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Testing cardiac response of αMHC-mTORkd transgenic mice to hypertrophic stimulation.A, comparison ofαMHC-mTORkd transgenic and littermate control hearts (3-month-old male) in response to isoproterenol and swimming stimulation. A, panel a, gross morphology of the hearts; panel b, statistic comparison of the ratio of heart weight versus body weight without and with swimming exercise (swim) or isoproterenol treatment (iso). There is no significant difference in change of heart weight after swimming exercise or isoproterenol treatment among these mice. Panel c, morphological comparison of the size of dispersed cardiomyocytes of nontreated control, swimming exercised, and isoproterenol-treated mice. Panel d, statistic comparison of the cell size. Similar degree of hypertrophic response was observed in nontransgenic (NTg) and αMHC-mTORkd transgenic cardiomyocytes.

C, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the functional aspect of αMHC-mTORkd and αMHC-mTORca transgenic hearts, we have used an echocardiograph to analyze the cardiac structure and function. Surprisingly, contrary to an overall normal cardiac histology, αMHC-mTORkd mice displayed slower heart rates and significantly altered diastolic and systolic ventricular chamber volumes associated with reduced cardiac function. Both ejection fraction and fraction shortening were reduced (Fig. 2B). However, αMHC-mTORca mice have normal cardiac function (Fig. 2B). The slower heart rate was further confirmed by ECG analysis (Fig. 2C). Although the QRS duration was not altered in αMHC-mTORkd mice, the P wave duration and the RR interval were significantly prolonged in αMHC-mTORkd mice. In addition, beat-to-beat RR interval variation was also evident in all αMHC-mTORkd mice, indicating altered pacemaker function of the sinoatrial node. This observation suggests that the conduction velocity of atria, but not ventricle, is affected in αMHC-mTORkd transgenic heart. These data suggest that mTOR kinase activity is not critical to normal cardiac hypertrophic growth but is more relevant in regulating cardiac function. Cardiac Hypertrophic Response in αMHC-mTORkd Transgenic Mice—A previous study indicated that rapamycin could attenuate the development of hypertrophy induced by physiological stimuli, such as swimming exercise (19Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M. Douglas P.S. Obata T. Franke T.F. Cantley L.C. Izumo S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2799-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). We initially hypothesized that mTOR might be an important player in cardiac physiological hypertrophic response. To test this, a swimming exercise test was performed on 3-month-old αMHC-mTORkd transgenic male mice as described previously (2Chen H. Yong W. Ren S. Shen W. He Y. Cox K.A. Zhu W. Li W. Soonpaa M.

Sex-matched nontransgenic littermates were used as controls. Surprisingly, the cardiac mass in αMHC-mTORkd mice subjected to 4 weeks of swimming exercise had a similar level of increase when compared with littermate controls (Fig. 3A). The percentage increase of the heart weight/body weight ratio (mg/g) in response to swim training was similar between no"
https://openalex.org/W2102685141,"We have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation to analyze the interactions among the α, β, and γ1 subunits of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein. Using cyan and yellow fluorescent protein fusion constructs, we show that overexpressed Gγ1 localizes to protoplast membranes, but Gβ exhibits membrane localization only when the Gγ1 protein is co-overexpressed. Overexpressed Gα shows membrane localization unaccompanied by overexpression of either Gβ or Gγ1. We detect fluorescence resonance energy transfer between Gβ and Gγ1 in the absence of Gα overexpression and between Gα and Gγ1 but only when all three subunits are co-overexpressed. Both Gα and Gβ are associated with large macromolecular complexes of ∼700 kDa in the plasma membrane. Gα is present in both large complexes and as free Gα in plasma membranes from wild type plants. In plants homozygous for a null allele of the Gβ gene, Gα is associated with smaller complexes in the 200–400-kDa range, indicating that its presence in the large complex depends on association with Gβγ. Activation of the Gα subunit with guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) results in partial dissociation of Gα from the complex. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promotes extensive dissociation of the Gα complex but does not interfere with binding of GTPγS to purified recombinant Gα, suggesting that reactive oxygen species affect the stability of the large complex but not the activity of Gα itself.

The results of pharmacological and genetic studies have provided evidence that the plant heterotrimeric G protein is involved in the transmission of light (1Warpeha K.M. Hamm H.E. Rasenick M.M.

Arabidopsis gpa1 mutant plants, which lack the Gα protein, encoded by the GPA1 gene, exhibit reduced cell division during hypocotyl and leaf formation (4Ullah H. Chen J.G. Young J.C. Im K.H. Sussman M.R. Jones A.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2066-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of GPA1 causes ectopic cell division, including meristem proliferation (5Okamoto H. Matsui M. Deng X.W. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 1639-1652PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous gpa1 mutant plants are less sensitive to abscisic acid inhibition of stomatal opening and guard cell inward K+ currents than wild type plants (6Wang X.Q. Ullah H. Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. Science. 2001; 292: 2070-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). By contrast, gpa1 mutant seeds exhibit hypersensitivity to abscisic acid in inhibition of germination and in root growth and seedling gene expression. In addition, gpa1 mutant plants are hyposensitive to gibberellic acid and brassinolide (7Chen J.G. Pandey S. Huang J. Alonso J.M. Ecker J.R. Assmann S.M. Jones A.M.

Arabidopsis agb1-2 mutant plants, which lack the Gβ protein encoded by the AGB1 gene, show alterations in leaf, flower and fruit development, decreased hypocotyl cell division and hypersensitivity to d-glucose (9Wang H.X. Weerasinghe R.R. Perdue T.D. Cakmakci N.G. Taylor J.P. Marzluff W.F. Jones A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4257-4269Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Chen J.G. Gao Y. Jones A.M.

There are two Gγ subunit genes in Arabidopsis, AGG1 and AGG2, and mutant analysis indicates that each Gγ subunit participates in a subset of Gβ-related developmental processes (12Trusov Y. Rookes J.E. Tilbrook K. Chakravorty D. Mason M.G. Anderson D. Chen J.G. Jones A.M. Botella J.R. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 1235-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Evidence is also accumulating that the heterotrimeric G protein mediates plant responses to bacterial and fungal pathogens and abiotic stress. Heterotrimeric G protein signaling to membrane-bound NADPH oxidase has been implicated in the development of disease resistance and in the apoptotic hypersensitive response in rice (13Suharsono U. Fujisawa Y. Kawasaki T. Iwasaki Y. Satoh H. Shimamoto K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13307-13312Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) and homozygous agb1–1 mutant plants are more susceptible to necrotrophic fungal pathogens than are wild type plants (14Trusov Y.

Jorda L. Molina A. Plant J. 2005; 43: 165-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The Gα and Gβ subunits serve both separable and synergistic functions in signaling by reactive oxygen species in the oxidative stress response (16Joo J.H. Wang S. Chen J.G. Jones A.M. Fedoroff N.V. Plant Cell. 2005; 17: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and the Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein mediates cell death signaling in the Arabidopsis unfolded protein response (UPR) (17Wang S. Narendra S. Fedoroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 3817-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). By contrast to the large number of different G protein subunits in animals, Arabidopsis has only one Gα subunit (18Ma H. Yanofsky M.F. Meyerowitz E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3821-3825Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), one Gβ subunit (19Weiss C.A. Garnaat C.W. Mukai K. Hu Y. Ma H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The Arabidopsis G protein subunits exhibit limited homology with their animal counterparts (22Jones A.M. Assmann S.M. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 572-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The GPA1 protein is roughly 30% identical to the mammalian Gα subfamily proteins, the AGB1 protein shows about 42% identity to mammalian Gβ subunits, and the AGGs display ∼25–35% identity with certain mammalian Gγ subunits (20Mason M.G.

White E. Huang H. Ma H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas Arabidopsis Gβ has been detected in the plasma membrane, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (24Adjobo-Hermans M.J.

A. 2000; 97: 14784-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and there is also evidence for interactions between the rice Gα and Gβ subunits (26Kato C. Mizutani T. Tamaki H. Kumagai H. Kamiya T. Hirobe A. Fujisawa Y. Kato H. Iwasaki Y. Plant J. 2004; 38: 320-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Structural predictions for Gα, Gβ, and Gγ1 suggest that they can form a heterotrimer similar to that formed by mammalian G protein subunits (27Ullah H. Chen J.G. Temple B. Boyes D.C. Alonso J.M. Davis K.R. Ecker J.R. Jones A.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although the heterotrimerization of Arabidopsis G protein subunits in cowpea protoplasts was recently reported (24Adjobo-Hermans M.J. Goedhart J. Gadella Jr., T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 5087-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), there is still limited information available about the structural and biochemical characteristics of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex. Here we provide further structural and biochemical characterization of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein complex using transgenic plants and transiently transformed Arabidopsis protoplasts. First, we show interactions between Gβ and Gγ1, as well as between Gα and Gβγ1 in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and co-immunoprecipitation. We then show that the heterotrimeric G protein is part of a large complex of roughly 700 kDa using blue native (BN) gel electrophoresis. We also show that the Gα subunit is present both in the large complex and as a free monomer in the plasma membrane fraction of wild type plants and that it is also detected in smaller complexes in agb1-2 mutant plants. We report that GTPγS 2The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; BN, blue native; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. binds to recombinant Gα protein and promotes slight dissociation of the Gα monomer from the large complex. Treatment of the plasma membrane fraction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) promotes the extensive dissociation of Gα from this complex but does not affect binding of GTPγS to the recombinant protein. These observations suggest that reactive oxygen species activate plant G protein signaling by promoting dissociation of the G protein macromolecular complex rather than by acting directly on the Gα protein. Plant Materials—We used Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants and agb1-2 and gpa1-4 null mutant homozygotes in the Col-0 background (27Ullah H. Chen J.G. Temple B. Boyes D.C. Alonso J.M. Davis K.R. Ecker J.R. Jones A.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Plants used to isolate plasma membrane fractions were grown in MetroMix 200 (Scotts-Sierra Horticultural Products Co., Marysville, OH) in 5-cm pots (51 per flat) at 65% humidity under fluorescent light at 150 μmol of photons/m2s with a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod for 5 weeks. Vectors for Expression of Cyan and Yellow Fluorescent Proteins (YFP) Fusions—The AGB and AGG1 coding sequences were cloned by PCR from a previously described A. thaliana Col-0 cDNA library (28Han M.H. Goud S. Song L. Fedoroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). According to sequence information in the Arabidopsis data base, primers were designed as follows, with the underlined sequences adding restriction sites, and the bold faced sequences adding a spacer (primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). The forward primer for AGB1 was 5′-AGATCTGGAGGTGGAGGTAGTATGTCTGTCTCCGAGCTCAA-3′; the reverse primer for AGB1 was 5′-TCTAGATCAAATCACTC TCCTGTGTCC-3′. The forward primer for AGG1 was 5′-AGATCTGGAGGTGGAGGTAGTATGCGAGAGGAAACTGTGGTT-3′; the reverse primer for AGG1 was (5′-TCTAGATCAAAGTATTAAGCATCTGCA-3′. To insert CFP into GPA1, the binary vector of loop CFP-GPA1 (L-CFP-GPA1) was obtained from Dr. Alan Jones (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The full-length sequence of L-CFP-GPA1 was cloned from the binary vector. The amplified PCR fragments were cloned into pGEM-Teasy (Promega, Madison. WI), and sequences were verified. To make the pAVA321-CFP (or YFP)-Gβ and pAVA321-YFP-Gγ1 constructs, PCR products were cleaved from pGEM-Teasy (Promega) and further cloned into pAVA321-C/YFP (a kind gift of Dr. Xuemei Chen, University of California, Riverside, CA) using the BglII and XbaI sites. To make the pAVA321-L-CFP-Gα, pVAV321-Gβ, and pAVA321-Gγ1 constructs, PCR fragments of L-CFP-GPA1, AGB1, or AGG1 were cleaved from corresponding pGEM-Teasy constructs and cloned into pAVA321 with the removal of CFP/YFP via NcoI and XbaI. Then, the entire (35S)Gβ or (35S)Gγ1 expression cassette was cut by ClaI and KpnI, and 5′ overhangs were filled by Klenow fragment to form blunt ends and then ligated into pAVA321-YFP-Gγ1 or pAVA321-YFP-Gβ using the ClaI and SmaI sites resulting in pAVA321-Gγ1-(35S)YFP-Gβ and pAVA321-Gβ-(35S)-YFP-Gγ1. Finally, the entire (35S)-L-CFP-Gα expression cassette was cloned into pAVA321-Gγ1-(35S)-YFP-Gβ or pAVA321-Gβ-(35S)-YFP-Gγ1 via SacI and SmaI sites and Klenow fragment as described above, resulting in pAVA321-L-CFP-Gα-(35S)-Gγ1-(35S)-YFP-Gβ and pAVA321-L-CFP-Gα-(35S)-Gβ-(35S)-YFP-Gγ1. The (35S)-L-CFP-Gα and (35S)-YFP-Gβ expression cassettes were further cloned into the pCAMBIA3300 Agrobacterium binary vector and transformed into homozygous agb1-2 and gpa1-4 mutant plants. Transformed plants that exhibited the wild type leaf morphology phenotype on 10 μg/ml glufosinate Murashige and Skoog basal medium plates were used for further study. Protoplast Isolation and Transfection, Confocal Microscopy, and FRET—Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were prepared from fully expanded leaves of 4–5-week-old plants and transfected using the polyethylene glycol method developed by Sheen and co-workers (29Kovtun Y. Chiu W.L. Tena G. Sheen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 2940-2945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). An additional 21% sucrose gradient was applied to the isolated protoplasts to obtain healthy protoplasts followed by transfection with plasmids containing the FRET pair to be tested. Plasmids were isolated using a Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). A total of ∼1 × 105 cells were transfected with 50 μg of plasmid for each microscopy observation, FRET measurement, or immunoprecipitation experiment. The transfected protoplasts were incubated at 22 °C for 12–16 h before being mounted in chambers (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for microscopy. The transfected protoplasts were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 META laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) with a 40× NA 1.2 water objective. To monitor fusion protein expression and localization, protoplasts were excited with two argon laser lines, 458 nm for CFP and 514 nm for YFP, and emission images were collected simultaneously with a 480–520-nm filter for CFP and a 530–590-nm filter for YFP. FRET is a method widely used to identify in vivo interactions between two proteins tagged with a donor (CFP) and an acceptor (YFP) fluorophor pair. FRET has also been used in conjunction with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy to monitor protein-protein interactions in plant cells (24Adjobo-Hermans M.J. Goedhart J. Gadella Jr., T.W. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 5087-5097Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 30Shah K. Russinova E. Gadella Jr., T.W. Willemse J. De Vries S.C.

Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3216-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). In addition to common concerns, several other factors complicating FRET analysis in plants have been identified (33Kato N. Pontier D. Lam E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Gadella Jr., T.W. van der Krogt G.N. Bisseling T. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 287-291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These are that (a) CFP and YFP excitation and emission spectra have crossover problems when a conventional epifluorescence microscope is used, (b) detection of FRET depends not only on the microscope optics but also on the relative local concentrations of the donor CFP fusion and the acceptor YFP fusion, (c) interference from the high background autofluorescence of chlorophyll, cell walls, and high concentrations of phenolic compounds in plant cells, and (d) photobleaching, which is conventionally used to confirm FRET in animal cells (35Bunemann M. Frank M. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 16077-16082Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 36Xu X. Meier-Schellersheim M. Jiao X. Nelson L.E. Jin T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 676-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), often cannot be applied to plant cells because it dramatically perturbs cellular structures (33Kato N. Pontier D. Lam E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To obviate these difficulties, we used a Zeiss LSM510 Meta spectral confocal fluorescence microscope equipped with a chameleon multiphoton laser, which can be modulated to a two-photon laser at 820 nm without any crossover excitation of YFP (37Diaspro A. Chirico G. Collini M. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 97-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In addition, λ stacks of acquired images were processed using the linear unmixing function mode of the Zeiss LSM510, allowing us to remove crossover emission from our analysis. Thus, our novel approach of two photon excitation combined with spectral image analysis allowed us to avoid the major type of artifact that plagues FRET studies performed with conventional epifluorescence microscopy (concern (a) above). To avoid concern (b) above, we ensured expression consistency between donor and acceptor molecules by transcriptionally fusing their expression cassettes into one construct, which we transfected into Arabidopsis protoplasts (Fig. 1B). The linear unmixing function mode of the Zeiss LSM510 also allowed us to remove autofluorescence signals, thus avoiding concern (c) above. We also performed extensive attempts to utilize photobleaching to confirm the FRET results reported here. However, we observed that protoplasts deformed or burst after the photobleaching procedure, and thus, the photobleaching method could not validly be used in our studies.FIGURE 1The predicted structure of the Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein and the CFP and YFP fusion constructs used in the present study.A, the predicted structure of Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G protein was redrawn from Ullah et al. (27Ullah H. Chen J.G. Temple B. Boyes D.C. Alonso J.M. Davis K.R. Ecker J.R. Jones A.M. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 393-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar).

NOS, gene terminator from agrobacterium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In further support of the method we used, we performed FRET tests using enhanced CFP-TGA5 and enhanced YFP-TGA5 as positive controls, because these proteins were previously shown to interact (33Kato N. Pontier D. Lam E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As negative controls, we assayed for FRET between enhanced CFP and enhanced YFP as well as between enhanced CFP-TGA5 and enhanced YFP-LexA (33Kato N. Pontier D. Lam E. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Constructs expressing the FRET fusion pairs used as positive and negative controls were kindly provided by Dr. Eric Lam. Upon CFP excitation with a two-photon laser at 820 nm, a YFP emission peak was detected in protoplasts expressing the positive FRET control pair but not the negative control pairs (data not shown). In this report spectral color encoding was performed with the Zeiss LSM 510 software. Thus, when a FRET signal was detected, the image is displayed in a green color indicating a YFP emission spectrum at loci in protoplasts expressing positive FRET pairs, whereas when a FRET signal was not detected, the image is displayed in a cyan color, indicating a CFP emission spectrum at loci in protoplasts expressing negative FRET pairs. Protoplasts co-transfected with CFP and YFP fusion proteins were excited with a chameleon multiphoton laser (Coherent MRU 1000), which was modulated to a 820-nm wavelength and set at 4–5% laser intensity, ideal for cross-talk-free FRET analysis. The emission spectra from selected regions of interest were recorded by a connected multi-channel spectrometer in 12 channels, each with a 10-nm bandwidth, from 464 to 584 nm, using a 650 KP dichroic mirror in the λ stack acquisition mode. Emission spectra were recorded from at least 20 individual protoplasts transfected with each G protein FRET pair tested. Spectral analysis for automatic peak detection was performed with the LSM 510 software. The fluorescence spectra of the CFP- and YFP-fused G protein subunits were corrected for background fluorescence. FRET ratios were calculated as the ratio of YFP and CFP emission, where the intensities of YFP and CFP emission at 532 and 479 nm, respectively, are recorded by the multichannel spectrometer upon excitation of the specimen with the two photon laser at 820 nm. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The catch and release reversible immunoprecipitation system (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was used for immunoprecipitation experiments. The transfected protoplasts were lysed with 1× wash buffer provided in the kit and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min. The clear extract was incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gα antibody (1:250) (gift of Dr. Alan M. Jones) and the affinity ligand (1:50) in the kit column at 4 °C for 10–12 h. The column was washed 3 times by centrifugation with 1× wash buffer. 1× denaturing elution buffer in the kit was used to elute bound proteins, which were then fractionated by electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane for Western blotting. Total extract, flow-through (concentrated using Strataclean resin from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and eluted proteins were loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide discontinuous gel (Bio-Rad mini electrophoresis system). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a Mini Trans-Blot electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Immunoblotting was performed with mouse monoclonal anti-G/C/Y antibodies (anti-G/C/Y antibody detects GFP, CFP, and YFP proteins, 1:2000, BD Biosciences). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies, proteins were detected using ECL Plus protein gel blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated three or more times using independent protein preparations. Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE)— Plasma membrane fractions for BN-PAGE were prepared using an aqueous two-phase partitioning system as described (38Sagi M. Fluhr R.

BN-PAGE/SDS-PAGE two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously with some modifications (28Han M.H. Goud S. Song L. Fedoroff N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 42Karlova R. Boeren S. Russinova E. Aker J. Vervoort J. de Vries S.

Plasma membrane proteins were incubated with solubilization buffer (20 mm Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 250 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 2 mm EDTA, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% Coomassie Blue G 250, and 10% glycerol) for 30 min and centrifuged twice at 15,000 × g for 5 min. For GTPγS or H2O2 treatment experiments, solubilization buffer containing 100 μm GTPγSor20 μm H2O2 was used. The supernatant was fractionated on a 5.5–16% blue native polyacrylamide gradient gel, and albumin bovine monomer (66 kDa), lactate dehydrogenase (140 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), and porcine thyroid (669kD) from Amersham Biosciences were loaded alongside as marker proteins. One lane of the first dimension BN-PAGE gel was transferred to Hybond-P PVDF membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and immunoblotted with anti-G/C/Y antibodies (BD Bioscience) to detect CFP-tagged Gβ complex. The remaining first dimension lanes of the BN-PAGE gel were cut and incubated in denaturing solution (1% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) for 2 h and applied to a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane for immunoblotting with anti-Gα antibody. Each experiment was repeated three times. The blots for GTPγS or H2O2 treatment experiments were scanned, and the intensity was quantified using Image J software. The percentage of the complex was calculated by the ratio of the value of the intensity of the complex to the value of the intensity of the total protein. Recombinant Gα Expression, Purification, and the [35S]GTPγS Binding Assay—We amplified GPA1 by PCR from an Arabidopsis cDNA library as described above using the forward primer 5′-GAGCTCATGGGCTTACTCTGCAGTAGAA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGTACCTCATA AAAGGCCAGCCTCCAGTAA-3′. The amplified fragment was cloned into QIAexpress pQE-30 His6 tag vector (Qiagen) at the SacI and KpnI restriction sites (underlined in the primer sequences) and expressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIPL strain (Stratagene). The recombinant His6-tagged Gα was purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (The QIAexpressionist, Qiagen). Purification was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, and the purified recombinant Gα protein was dialyzed against GTPγS binding assay buffer (50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 5 μm GDP, and 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl). The recombinant Gα was incubated with 20 nm [35S]GTPγS in the above buffer for different times, and the reaction was diluted with stop solution (25 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl). The reaction mixture was applied to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane filter (Whatman, Florham Park, NJ), which was rinsed 3 times with stop solution to remove free [35S]GTPγS. The amount of recombinant Gα-bound [35S]GTPγS was then quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The specific binding of [35S]GTPγS with recombinant Gα was evaluated by nucleotide competition experiments with unlabeled ATP and GTP. The effect of H2O2 on the binding of [35S]GTPγS to recombinant Gα was tested as described (44Nishida M. Schey K.L. Takagahara S. Kontani K. Katada T. Urano Y. Nagano T. Nagao T. Kurose H. J. Biol.

Overexpression and Subcellular Localization of Arabidopsis Heterotrimeric G Protein Subunits—Based on the predicted structure of the Arabidopsis G protein, we constructed genes encoding N-terminal fusions of enhanced CFPs and YFPs and Gβ and Gγ1, respectively, and expressed them from a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (Fig. 1, A and B).

https://openalex.org/W1986198261,"Although the covalent attachment of a polyubiquitin is the prevailing paradigm for entry into proteasomes, accumulating evidence suggests that poorly defined ubiquitin-free pathways also degrade proteins. The cytidine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) potently inhibits human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication by disrupting viral reverse transcription. However, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 produces a viral infectivity factor (Vif) to destroy this antiretroviral protein. It was shown that Vif binds to both A3G and a Cullin 5 ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase. It is currently accepted that this enzyme polyubiquitylates A3G on lysine residues, resulting in its degradation by proteasomes. Here, we find that A3G without ubiquitylation is still degraded by proteasomes in a Vif-dependent manner. We further show that Vif is polyubiquitylated and that this event could be critical for A3G proteasomal degradation. Thus, A3G is degraded by a novel pathway that might involve ubiquitylation of one protein and then targets a second binding partner for proteasomal entry and degradation. We propose that instead of triggering A3G polyubiquitylation, polyubiquitylated Vif might serve as a vehicle to transport A3G into proteasomes for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2030235549,"Saturn's moon Rhea had been considered massive enough to retain a thin, externally generated atmosphere capable of locally affecting Saturn's magnetosphere. The Cassini spacecraft's in situ observations reveal that energetic electrons are depleted in the moon's vicinity. The absence of a substantial exosphere implies that Rhea's magnetospheric interaction region, rather than being exclusively induced by sputtered gas and its products, likely contains solid material that can absorb magnetospheric particles. Combined observations from several instruments suggest that this material is in the form of grains and boulders up to several decimetres in size and orbits Rhea as an equatorial debris disk. Within this disk may reside denser, discrete rings or arcs of material."
https://openalex.org/W2028358947,"Lipofuscin contains fluorophores, which represent a biomarker for cellular aging. Although it remains unsubstantiated clinically, experimental results support that the accumulation of lipofuscin is related to an increased risk of choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of legal blindness. Here, we report that a major lipofuscin component, A2E, activates the retinoic acid receptor (RAR). In vitro experiments using luciferase reporter assay, competitional binding assay, analysis of target genes, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay strongly suggest that A2E is a bona fide ligand for RAR and induces sustained activation of RAR target genes. A2E-induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line (ARPE-19) and RAR antagonist blocked the up-regulation of VEGF. The conditioned medium of A2E-treated ARPE-19 cells induced tube formation in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells, which was blocked by the RAR antagonist and anti-VEGF antibody. These results suggest that A2E accumulation results in the phenotypic alteration of retinal pigment epithelial cells, predisposing the environment to choroidal neovascularization development. This is mediated through the agonistic function of A2E, at least in part. The results of this study provide a novel potential therapeutic target for this incurable condition.

Thus, a better understanding of the pathogenesis is needed to pursue a novel potential pharmaceutical target. Visual loss in AMD is caused by CNV, i.e. the neovascular vessels extending from the choroid below the sensory retina, and the subsequent atrophy of the RPE.

Med. 2000; 342: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although it remains unsubstantiated whether the accumulation of lipofuscin is related to the development of exudative AMD, the fact that most abundant accretion is in the RPE cells under the central retina suggests that there may be a causal relationship between lipofuscin accumulation and exudative AMD (2Sparrow J.R. Boulton M. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Laboratory studies also support that there may be a causal relationship between lipofuscin accumulation and the progression of exudative AMD (7Zhou J. Cai B. Jang Y.P. Pachydaki S. Schmidt A.M. Sparrow J.R. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 8Zhou J. Jang Y.P. Kim S.R. Sparrow J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). There is a strong impetus to understand how the accumulation of these potentially toxic lipofuscin fluorophores contribute to AMD; however, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism of CNV development. RPE lipofuscin is a byproduct of the phagocytosis of lipid-rich photoreceptor outer segments and consists of a complex mixture of pigments. A major fluorophore is A2E (N-retinyledin-N-retinylethanolamin) (9Eldred G.E. Lasky M.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), which arises from a Schiff base reaction from ethanolamine and vitamin A-aldehyde (10Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In vitro, A2E affects normal RPE functions by causing membrane permeabilization inhibiting lysosomal function (11Finnemann S.C. Leung L.W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3842-3847Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), inhibiting cytochrome c oxygenase (12Suter M. Reme C. Grimm C. Wenzel A. Jaattela M. Esser P. Kociok N. Leist M. Richter C. J.

Kopitz J. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and partly mediating light damage by acting as a photosensitizer (14Sparrow J.R. Nakanishi K. Parish C.A. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 1981-1989PubMed Google Scholar), targeting DNA (15Sparrow J.R. Vollmer-Snarr H.R. Zhou J. Jang Y.P. Jockusch S. Itagaki Y. Nakanishi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18207-18213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that A2E is an endogenous ligand for retinoic acid receptor (RAR). The data suggest that A2E accumulation results in the pro-angiogenic conversion of retinal pigment epithelial cell phenotype predisposing the environment to CNV development via RAR activation, at least in part. A2E Synthesis—A2E was prepared from all-trans-retinal and ethanolamine according to the method in literature (10Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Typically, a mixture of all-trans-retinal (50 mg, 176 μmol) and ethanolamine (4.6 mg, 78 μmol) in ethanol (1.5 ml) was stirred in the presence of acetic acid (4.7 μl, 78 μmol) at room temperature under dark conditions for 2 days. The reaction mixture was evaporated and then purified by silica gel column chromatography. After elution with MeOH:CH2Cl2 (5:95) to remove less polar byproducts, further elution with MeOH:CH2Cl2 (5:95) including 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid gave A2E (21 mg, 38%). The product was confirmed by NMR (JEOL GSX 270), UVvisible (JASCO-V550), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Bruker model Reflux III), and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (TSK Silica Gel 60) analysis. All spectral data were consistent with previous reports (9Eldred G.E. Lasky M.R. Nature. 1993; 361: 724-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 10Parish C.A. Hashimoto M. Nakanishi K. Dillon J. Sparrow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14609-14613Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Also, the chromatogram of A2E shows a single sharp peak without any other retinoid contamination as shown in Fig. 2C. Cell Culture—Human retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE19) cells and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 10% CO2. For uptake into cultured cells, A2E was delivered at 1, 10, and 100 nm concentrations into the culture media, and confluent cultures of the cells were incubated with A2E, all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), or ethanol (control) for the indicated period. Preliminary experiments have demonstrated that after confluence for 6 weeks and for 24 h the cells showed similar responses to A2E exposure, the cells at 24 h after confluence were used for analysis. ELISA was used for determining VEGF in ARPE-19 cells. For the ELISA experiment, ARPE-19 cells were plated in a 24-well plate in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, pretreated with dextram-coated charcoal, and incubated overnight. The spent medium was collected for the measurement of VEGF. The ELISA for VEGF was performed using the human VEGF immunoassay system (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Luciferase Assay—For the transfection experiment, 2 × 104 HEC-293T cells were plated in a 24-well plate in phenol red-free DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, pretreated with dextram-coated charcoal, and incubated overnight. The MH100-tkLuc reporter plasmid (100 ng) was cotransfected with the internal control plasmid pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) and the expression plasmids, pCMX-Gal, p-CMX-Gal-RARα, p-CMX-Gal-RXRα, p-CMX-Gal-PNR, p-CMX-Gal-PPARγ, and p-CMX-Gal-FXR using the SuperFect®t transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase reporter vector for the VEGF promoter was constructed as previously described (16Akiyama H. Tanaka T. Maeno T. Kanai H. Kimura Y. Kishi S. Kurabayashi M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1367-1374PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of each transfected DNA sample was adjusted with carrier DNA to make a total of 200 ng. After transfection, ligands were added to the medium and cultured for 24 h. The cells were lysed in 100 μl/well of passive lysis buffer, and the luciferase assay was performed in accordance with the protocols of the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System, using a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Binding Assay—For expression of the ligand-binding domain (DEF) of RARα in Escherichia coli, the expression vector pGEX was used. GST fusion protein (GST-RARα-DEF) was expressed in E. coli M-15 after isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and purified on gluthathione-Sepharose beads as described previously (17Yanagi Y. Suzawa M. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Yanagisawa J. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12971-12974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The expression of the protein of the predicted size was monitored by SDS-PAGE. The GST-RARα protein (2–3 pmol) was incubated in 0.2 ml of binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) containing 270 pm [3H]atRA, and various concentrations of atRA or A2E. After 3 h of incubation at room temperature, the tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants were subjected to liquid scintillation counting. To determine the Kd, nonlinear regression analysis of the competition curves was carried out using Prism 4 (GraphPad). Reverse Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—RNA for RT-PCR was isolated using an SV Total RNA Isolation Kit (Promega, Madison, WI) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using Superscript III for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Each PCR was carried out in a 20-μl volume using Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix UDG (Invitrogen) to denature for 15 min at 95 °C, followed by 55 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, and 60 °C for 1 min in Roche LightCycler. Values for each gene were normalized to expression levels of GAPDH. The sequences of the primers used for RT-PCR were as follows: human GAPDH, left, 5′-gagtcaacggatttggtcgt-3′, right, 5′-ttgattttggagggatctcg-3′; human VEGF, left 5′-atgtgcatggtgatgttgga-3′, right, 5′-gcttgctgctgtacctccac-3′; human RARβ2, left 5′-ggtttcactggcttgaccat-3′, right, 5′-ggcaaaggtgaacacaaggt-3′; human NORPEG, left, 5′-caagagccccataaacctca-3′, right, 5′-aaggcttccacagc-3′; and human SCD, left, 5′-tcctatgggaagctggtcac-3′, right, 5′-ggatagacagggcagagcag-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP analysis was performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate), according to the manufacturer's instructions. ARPE-19 cells were cultured in the presence of A2E or atRA. Soluble chromatin prepared from 1× 106 cells was immunoprecipitated with an antibody against αAcH4 (Upstate Biotechnology). A negative control experiment was performed using anti-IgG, which gave no positive signals. HPLC—Samples of A2E were analyzed using normal phase HPLC on a silica column (TSK Silica Gel 60 Toso) using the mobile phase, dichloromethane:methanol:triethylamine (200: 10:0.25, v/v) at 1.0 ml/min. The eluted peaks were analyzed with a UV detector (430 nm). Samples of atRA were analyzed using normal phase HPLC on a silica column (TSK Silica Gel 60 Toso) using the mobile phase, dichloromethane/trifluoroacetic acid (2000:1, v/v), at 1.0 ml/min. The eluted peaks were analyzed with a UV detector (340 nm). In Vitro Tube Formation Assay—In vitro anti-angiogenesis activity was evaluated with the in vitro tube formation assay. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) starved of serum for 4 h were seeded at a cell density of 40,000 cells per well in 24-well culture plates (Nalge Nunc International), pre-coated with 0.4 ml of low-growth factor synthetic matrix (Matrigel; BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA) and cultured with DMEM or the conditioned medium (DMEM) collected from ARPE19 cells exposed to A2E for 24 h, either in the presence or absence of Ro415253 or neutralizing antibody against VEGF. Tube formation was determined 16 h after cells were plated on Matrigel, by counting the number of connected cells in five randomly selected fields at ×200 magnification, and dividing that number by the total number of cells in the same field. Micrographs were taken under a phase-contrast light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). A2E Is a Ligand for RAR—Given the lipid-soluble nature of A2E, the effects of A2E on the nuclear receptor function were investigated by means of a luciferase assay. Subsequently, it was found that A2E transactivates RAR in HEC-293T cells using GAL-4 DBD fused to the RARα ligand-binding domain with a luciferase reporter gene plasmid containing the GAL-4 DBD-binding site in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, a and b). Similar results were obtained using full-length RARα with a reporter plasmid containing the consensus RARE sequence (DR1) (data not shown). A2E only transactivated RAR, and not other nuclear receptors including the retinoid X receptor (RXR) α, peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) γ, or orphan nuclear receptors including the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) or the photoreceptor cell-specific receptor (PNR) (Fig. 1a). Based on the fact that the nuclear receptor recruits coactivators such SRC-1 (steroid receptor coactivator-1), TIF2 (transcriptional intermediary factor 2), AIB-1 (amplified in breast cancer-1) upon ligand binding, the present study examined A2E-induced interactions of RARα with coactivators in the mammalian two-hybrid system, which showed A2E-induced bindings of p160 coactivators (SRC-1, TIF2, and AIB-1) to RARα (data not shown). Next, to verify whether A2E acts as a cognate ligand for RARα, it was investigated as to whether A2E could compete for specific binding of [3H]all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) to the RARα ligand binding domain-GST fusion protein (GST-RARα) in vitro. It was demonstrated that A2E bound to GST-RARα with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 8.74 nm, whereas that of atRA was 0.49 nm (Fig. 1c). The control vehicle alone did not interfere with the binding of [3H]atRA to the GST-RARα, confirming the specific binding of A2E. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that A2E treatment transactivated the established RAR target genes, such as NORPEG (novel retinal pigment epithelial cell gene) (18Kutty R.K. Kutty G. Samuel W. Duncan T. Bridges C.C. El-Sherbeeny A. Nagineni C.N. Smith S.B. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2831-2840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), SCD (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) (19Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M. Chandraratna R.A. Wiggert B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28744-28750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and RARβ2 (20Perissi V. Aggarwal A. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 511-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) in a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 2a). Specifically, the real time RT-PCR measurements indicated that whereas vehicle-treated cells showed no change in the expression of these genes, greater than 3-fold increases were observed in levels of NORPEG, SCD, and RARβ2 mRNA following atRA treatment for 24 and 48 h, as expected. Likewise, 2.5–3-fold increases in levels of NORPEG, SCD, and RARβ2 mRNA were observed at 24 and 48 h after A2E treatment. Together, these experiments demonstrate that A2E is a bona fide RAR ligand. A2E Induces Sustained Activation of RAR Target Genes—Noteworthy was that in the ARPE-19 cells, at 72 and 96 h after atRA treatment, the expression levels of RAR target genes returned to normal levels, whereas they remained up-regulated or steadily increased after A2E treatment. RAR recruits histone acetyltransferase upon ligand binding and acetylate histones including histone H4, to regulate gene transcription (21Korzus E. Torchia J. Rose D.W. Xu L. Kurokawa R. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Science. 1998; 279: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). To confirm the acetylation of histone H4 of the promoter region of these genes, a ChIP assay was performed. The results revealed that both A2E and atRA treatments enhanced the acetylation of histone H4 associated with both SCD and the RARβ2 promoter at 24 h after treatment. The acetylation was sustained even at 96 h after A2E treatment, whereas it declined at 96 h after atRA treatment (Fig. 2b). Using RARα antibodies, the promoter was occupied with RARα, regardless of the presence or absence of ligands as previously reported (20Perissi V. Aggarwal A. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2004; 116: 511-526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Furthermore, HPLC analysis demonstrated that atRA was turned over or expelled from ARPE-19 cells after 72 h, which is in contrast to A2E, which remained at least 72 h after treatment (Fig. 2c). Together with the results of RT-PCR analysis and ChIP assays these results suggest that residual A2E activated the expression of these genes. After A2E treatment, atRA was not detected at any point tested in the ARPE-19 cells, suggesting that A2E is unlikely to be metabolically converted to produce atRA. A2E Induces VEGF through the Activation of RAR—VEGF production is also up-regulated by atRA in some cell lines (16Akiyama H. Tanaka T. Maeno T. Kanai H. Kimura Y. Kishi S. Kurabayashi M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1367-1374PubMed Google Scholar), raising the possibility that VEGF is up-regulated by A2E in RPE cells. Thus, following treatment with A2E, the changes in expression of the VEGF protein were investigated. The cells expressed higher levels of VEGF protein after treatment with A2E as well as atRA (Fig. 3a). The real time PCR measurements indicated a 3-fold increase in VEGF mRNA as a result of treatment by A2E (Fig. 3a). Luciferase assays demonstrated that as well as atRA, A2E increased the luciferase levels ∼3–5-fold in HEC-293 cells transfected with the luciferase plasmid containing the VEGF promoter, suggesting that A2E regulated these expressions at the transcriptional level (Fig. 3c). Up-regulated expression of VEGF mRNA by A2E treatment was diminished by siRNA against RARα, but not by scramble RNA and the addition of Ro415253, a potent RARα antagonist. But it was not diminished by treatment of specific inhibitors for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), U0126, or phosphoinositide 3-kinase, wortmannin, or in the presence of the antioxidants, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, or pyrolidinedithiocarbamate (Fig. 3b). Moreover, VEGF luciferase reporter activation induced by A2E was diminished by siRNA against RARα, but not by scramble siRNA (Fig. 3c), suggesting that A2E stimulates VEGF expression by RARα-mediated transactivation. Furthermore, the luciferase assay demonstrated that the effects of both atRA and A2E on the VEGF promoter were abrogated using plasmids containing mutations of four Sp-1 binding sites, previously shown to be indispensable for RAR-mediated VEGF transactivation (16Akiyama H. Tanaka T. Maeno T. Kanai H. Kimura Y. Kishi S. Kurabayashi M. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 43: 1367-1374PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the binding sites were necessary for VEGF induction by A2E, as well as atRA (Fig. 3c). To examine whether A2E stimulates VEGF expression and promotes angiogenesis, it was examined whether HUVECs form capillary-like structures in response to secreted factors from the ARPE19 cells exposed to A2E. The results demonstrated that HUVECs cultured with the conditioned medium of ARPE-19 after A2E treatment induced capillary-like tube formation, suggesting that ARPE19 cells secrete factor(s) to promote angiogenesis after exposure to A2E. To examine whether activation of RARα and VEGF expression are involved, the in vitro tube formation was performed by coincubation with either Ro415253 or human VEGF antibody, which demonstrated that tube formation was inhibited when Ro415253 or human VEGF antibody was present (Fig. 4), suggesting that inactivation of either RARα or VEGF leads to decreased angiogenesis activity. In conclusion, these data support that A2E stimulates VEGF expression and promotes angiogenesis presumably by activating RARα in cells. It was demonstrated that A2E is an endogenous ligand for RARα. A2E binds RARα in vitro, and transactivates RARα. Furthermore, A2E treatment transactivated established RAR target genes, such as NORPEG, SCD, and RARβ2 in ARPE-19 cells, and the ChIP assay revealed that A2E treatment induces acetylation of histone H4 associated with SCD and RARβ2 promoters. These results support that A2E acts as a bona fide ligand for RAR. Previous investigations have demonstrated several examples where biological metabolites act as ligands for nuclear receptors (22Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). For example, bile acid, which is the biological metabolite of cholesterol is well known to act as the ligand for FXR and negatively regulate its own biosynthesis through FXR (22Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Similarly, cholesterol metabolites produced from squalene by a shunt in the classical cholesterol biosynthesis pathway acts as natural LXR ligand. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is activated by a wide variety of compounds including natural and synthetic steroids (22Francis G.A. Fayard E. Picard F. Auwerx J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 261-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). The results of this study, in conjunction with those of these previous investigations, support the importance of biological metabolites on the nuclear receptor functions. Accumulation of A2E in RPE cells induces the sustained activation of RAR and stimulates the expression of a potent pro-angiogenic factor, VEGF. Several groups have previously reported the effects of atRA on angiogenesis, although the results obtained are controversial (23Majewski S. Szmurlo A. Marczak M. Jablonska S. Bollag W. Cancer Lett. 1993; 75: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Wilks J.W. Schweigerer L. Orci L. Montesano R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 25Gaetano C. Catalano A. Illi B. Felici A. Minucci S. Palumbo R. Facchiano F. Mangoni A. Mancarella S. Muhlhauser J. Capogrossi M.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E38-E47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some groups have reported an anti-angiogenic effect (23Majewski S. Szmurlo A. Marczak M. Jablonska S. Bollag W. Cancer Lett. 1993; 75: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 24Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Wilks J.W. Schweigerer L. Orci L. Montesano R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For example, Majewski et al. (23Majewski S. Szmurlo A. Marczak M. Jablonska S. Bollag W. Cancer Lett. 1993; 75: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that atRA functions to inhibit angiogenesis using in vivo tumor cell-induced angiogenesis assay. Similarly, Pepper et al. (24Pepper M.S. Vassalli J.D. Wilks J.W. Schweigerer L. Orci L. Montesano R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 419-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) reported the anti-angiogenic effects of atRA using an in vitro three-dimensional collagen gel assay. On the other hand, pro-angiogenic effects have been reported by a in vitro tube formation assay using HUVECs and normal human dermal fibroblast (25Gaetano C. Catalano A. Illi B. Felici A. Minucci S. Palumbo R. Facchiano F. Mangoni A. Mancarella S. Muhlhauser J. Capogrossi M.C. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: E38-E47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that atRA and the RARα ligand AM80 up-regulate VEGF production in fibroblast cells (26Saito A. Sugawara A. Uruno A. Kudo M. Kagechika H. Sato Y. Owada Y. Kondo H. Sato M. Kurabayashi M. Imaizumi M. Tsuchiya S. Ito S. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 1412-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The conflicting reports may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that nuclear receptor ligands have different actions depending on cellular context. The difference in the response to the same ligand may be due to the quantity of cofactor or other regulatory factors in cells (27Kodera Y. Takeyama K. Murayama A. Suzawa M. Masuhiro Y. Kato S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33201-33204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The data in the present study support that A2E, as well as atRA, stimulate VEGF expression by activating RAR in RPE cells. The molecular mechanism that leads to different angiogenic response in different cells with the same ligand is an important issue for future research. The age-related maculopathy is pathologically characterized by age-related changes in the RPE, such as accumulation of lipofuscine in Bruch's membrane (4Fine S.L. Berger J.W. Maguire M.G. Ho A.C. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 342: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although it is not substantiated whether accumulation of lipofuscin is related to the development of exudative AMD clinically, some research results suggest that there may be a causal relationship between lipofuscin accumulation and exudative AMD (2Sparrow J.R. Boulton M. Exp. Eye Res. 2005; 80: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 7Zhou J. Cai B. Jang Y.P. Pachydaki S. Schmidt A.M. Sparrow J.R. Exp.

A. 2006; 103: 16182-16187Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The data in the present study support that the accumulation of A2E induces the enhancement of VEGF expression, suggesting a role of A2E in the progression of exudative AMD. Anti-VEGF therapy is currently showing favorable results in the treatment of CNV (28Moshfeghi A.A. Rosenfeld P.J. Puliafito C.A. Michels S. Marcus E.N. Lenchus J.D. Venkatraman A.S. Ophthalmology. 2006; 113 (e2001–e2012): 2002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), suggesting VEGF plays a pivotal role in the progression of CNV. However, the overexpression of VEGF in RPE cells is not sufficient to induce CNV. Recent studies have demonstrated that loss of integrity of Bruch's membrane, as well as overexpression of VEGF in RPE cells, is required to induce CNV (29Schwesinger C. Yee C. Rohan R.M. Joussen A.M.

Yoshida et al. (30Yoshida T. Ohno-Matsui K. Ichinose S. Sato T. Iwata N. Saido T.C. Hisatomi T. Mochizuki M. Morita I. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 2793-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) also reported that the expression of VEGF is increased in the neprilysin gene-disrupted mice but that no CNV was observed. Clinically, it is well known that the accumulation of A2E is seen in Stargardt's disease, but the occurrence of CNV is rare (31Cideciyan A.V. Aleman T.S. Swider M. Schwartz S.B. Steinberg J.D. Brucker A.J. Maguire A.M. Bennett J. Stone E.M. Jacobson S.G. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the loss of integrity of Bruch's membrane, in combination with the accumulation of A2E, is needed for the occurrence of CNV. Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin (PDT) has been shown to reduce the overall risk of moderate visual loss and lesion growth, and has been the standard therapy for patients with exudative AMD (5Wormald R. Evans J. Smeeth L. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2000; 2: CD002030Google Scholar). However, histopathological studies have shown that the effect of PDT is limited, and clinical studies have demonstrated that in most cases, repeated treatment is needed every three months. Recently, it has been demonstrated that intravitreous injection of anti-VEGF antibody is effective for patients with neovascular AMD, improving visual acuity and reducing retinal edema, but the inhibition of VEGF signaling is considered to elevate the risk of adverse systemic effects. For example, Lee et al. (32Lee S. Chen T.T. Barber C.L. Jordan M.C. Murdock J. Desai S. Ferrara N. Nagy A. Roos K.P. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Cell. 2007; 130: 691-703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) demonstrated that genetic deletion of VEGF specifically in the endothelial lineage lead to progressive endothelial degeneration and sudden death in mutant mice. Another group demonstrated that the intravitreous injection of the anti-VEGF antibody fraction, ranibizumab, may tend to increase the risk of myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction in a dose-dependant manner (33Gillies M.C. Wong T.Y. N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 356 (749–750): 748-749PubMed Google Scholar, 34Dafer R.M. Schneck M. Friberg T.R. Jay W.M. Semin. Ophthalmol. 2007; 22: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Thus, to pursue a novel therapeutic target is mandatory. Much effort has been directed to understanding the mechanism of lipofuscin toxicity on RPE cells. The current investigation suggests that the endogenous accumulation of A2E both induces sustained RAR activation in RPE cells and activates the expression of pro-angiogenic factors. The induction and activation contribute to the phenotypic alteration of RPE to the chronic pro-angiogenic state observed in AMD and predisposes eyes to CNV formation. The pro-angiogenic effect of A2E is diminished by the RAR antagonist and siRNA against RARα, suggesting that RAR may be a new potential pharmaceutical target for the treatment of AMD. As a variety of important biological functions are regulated through RAR, further investigations will be needed for the therapeutic application of these findings. Also, understanding how A2E is metabolized would be interesting to pursue novel potential pharmacological targets. Additionally, further identification of lipofuscin components and their actions on nuclear receptors might contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AMD."

However, in cases of familial TTR-related amyloidosis and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA), TTR is deposited as amyloid fibrils, leading to organ dysfunction and possibly death. The mechanism by which TTR undergoes the transition from stable, soluble precursor to insoluble amyloid fibril and the factors that promote this process are largely undetermined. Most models involve the dissociation of the native TTR tetramer as the initial step. It is largely accepted that the TTR gene mutations associated with TTR-related amyloidosis lead to the expression of variant proteins that are intrinsically unstable and prone to aggregation. It has been suggested that amyloidogenicity may be conferred to wild-type TTR (the form deposited in SSA) by chemical modification of the lone cysteine residue (Cys10) through mixed disulfide bonds. S-Sulfonation and S-cysteinylation are prevalent TTR modifications physiologically, and studies have suggested their ability to modulate the structure of TTR under denaturing conditions. In the present study, we have used fluorescence-detected sedimentation velocity to determine the effect of S-sulfonate and S-cysteine on the quaternary structural stability of fluorophore-conjugated recombinant TTR under nondenaturing conditions.

Finally, as proof of concept, we report the sedimentation of TTR in serum and the qualitative assessment of the resulting data. The amyloidoses are a class of protein folding disorders in which one of over 20 different soluble precursor proteins misfolds, aggregates, and deposits in various tissues, causing organ dysfunction and, in many cases, death (1Walley V.M.

One of these precursor proteins is transthyretin (TTR 3The abbreviations used are: TTR, transthyretin; ATTR, familial TTR-related amyloidosis; SSA, senile systemic amyloidosis; FITC, fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; rTTR, recombinant human transthyretin; rTTR-SO3H, S-sulfonated rTTR; rTTR-Cys, S-cysteinylated rTTR; ESI, electrospray ionization; MS, mass spectrometry; LC, liquid chromatography; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; F-rTTR, FITC-labeled rTTR; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. ; Swiss-Prot accession number P02766), a small (Mr 13761) plasma protein that self-associates into tetramers under physiological conditions. Normally a stable protein, TTR has been implicated in two distinct forms of systemic amyloidosis, familial TTR-related amyloidosis (ATTR) and senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA). ATTR usually involves a point mutation in the coding region of the TTR gene, leading to the production of a variant protein containing one of over 80 pathological amino acid substitutions (4Connors L.H. Lim A. Prokaeva T. Roskens V.A. Costello C.E. Amyloid. 2003; 10: 160-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Amyloid deposits in ATTR generally manifest clinically as polyneuropathies and/or cardiomyopathies, depending on the organs of involvement (5Benson M.D. Uemichi T. Amyloid. 1996; 3: 44-56Crossref Scopus (240) Google Scholar). In SSA, wild-type TTR deposition occurs in the myocardium (6Westermark P. Sletten K. Johansson B. Cornwell III, G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2843-2845Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar) and can cause atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure (7Wright J.R. Calkins E. J. Am. Geriatr.

Murdoch W.L. Kyle R.A. Westermark P. Pitkänen P. Am. J. Med. 1983; 75: 618-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and as the elderly population in industrialized countries continues to grow, the disease will probably contribute a significant yet underrecognized source of cardiac dysfunction. It is, therefore, of great importance to establish a molecular understanding of the factors promoting the disease and to investigate strategies whereby these processes may be abrogated. In both SSA and ATTR, the mechanism underlying TTR structural rearrangement, aggregation, and deposition is largely undetermined. However, in recent years, in vitro studies have suggested that perturbation of the native structure is required for (or at least accelerates) amyloid formation (12Kelly J.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 13Damas A.M. Saraiva M.J. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 290-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Under denaturing conditions, tetramer dissociation is the initial and rate-limiting step of fibrillogenesis (14Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarström P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11442-11452Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Quintas A. Vaz D.C. Cardoso I. Saraiva M.J. Brito R.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7365-7381Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, ATTR-related amino acid substitutions probably enhance the population of monomeric, aggregation-prone subunits either by directly destabilizing the tetramer (quaternary structural destabilization) or by lowering the free energy of the partially unfolded monomer (tertiary/secondary structural destabilization). It is not immediately obvious how structural instability could be conferred to wild-type TTR, but post-translational modifications are a possibility. In human serum, TTR is extensively modified at its lone cysteine residue (Cys10) through mixed disulfide bonds with a number of different compounds (17Théberge R. Connors L.H. Skinner M. Skare J. Costello C.E. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 452-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 18Suhr O.B. Svendsen I.H. Ohlsson P.-I. Lendoire J. Trigo P. Tashima K. Ranløv P.J. Ando Y.

Chem. 2003; 278: 49707-49713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Of these, adducts of sulfonate (S-sulfonation) and cysteine (S-cysteinylation) are generally the most common. Several research groups, including ours, have hypothesized that Cys10 modifications modulate TTR stability at the quaternary or tertiary/secondary level, thereby altering the propensity of wild-type TTR to form amyloid fibrils. Much insight into the structural basis of TTR amyloid formation has been realized in recent years with techniques such as chaotrope-, thermal-, and acid-mediated unfolding assays. These methods provide a useful paradigm for analyzing differential structural effectors, such as amino acid substitutions or post-translational modifications, between related samples under denaturing conditions but do not allow straightforward generalization to physiological conditions. These methods are practical, because, with few exceptions (21Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 22Hammarström P. Sekijima Y. White J.T. Wiseman R.L. Lim A. Costello C.E. Altland K. Garzuly F. Budka H. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), neither wild-type nor variant TTR aggregate at physiological pH within an experimentally practical time frame. However, the critical step in fibrillogenesis, tetramer dissociation, could theoretically be evaluated by primary analytical methods under nondenaturing conditions. Since all previous evidence suggests the importance of this step, it is desirable to provide first principles methods for evaluating effectors of tetramer stability. Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation is a powerful method for analyzing protein self-association (23Svedberg T. Pedersen K.O. The Ultracentrifuge. Oxford, London, 1940: 28-29Google Scholar, 24Schachman H.K. Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry. Academic Press, Inc., New York1959: 157-170Google Scholar, 25Cann J.R. Interacting Macromolecules: The Theory and Practice of Their Electrophoresis, Ultracentrifugation and Chromatography. Academic Press, Inc., New York1970: 133-149Google Scholar). One of the more general approaches for the analysis of such systems is the determination of the isotherm of weight-average sedimentation coefficients (s¯) as a function of concentration (26Correia J.J. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 321: 81-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Stafford W.F. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 323: 302-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 28Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 29Sontag C.A. Stafford W.F. Correia J.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 215-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The concentration dependence of s¯ is a thermodynamic phenomenon governed solely by the law of mass action, and the experimental measurement in the ultracentrifuge is completely independent of solvent composition. An experimental limitation is that the molecule must be optically detectable at concentrations where dissociation occurs. Therefore, the sensitivity limits of the standard centrifuge optical systems may restrict the analysis of tightly associating systems. Such is the case with TTR where, for the wild-type protein, dissociation is not detected at concentrations accessible with either the absorbance or interference optical systems. Recently, fluorescence detection has been developed for the analytical ultracentrifuge (30MacGregor I.K. Anderson A.L. Laue T.M. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 165-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The superior sensitivity of this system allows detection at concentrations several orders of magnitude lower than the existing optical systems. In addition, the selectivity of fluorescence allows the detection of target molecules contained in complex biological fluids like plasma, urine, or cerebrospinal fluid. In the current study, fluorescence-detected sedimentation velocity was used to examine the contribution of two biologically relevant cysteine modifications to the stability of the TTR tetramer under nondenaturing conditions. These conditions effectively uncouple quaternary structural perturbations from tertiary and secondary effects, a differentiation not allowed by the previously employed denaturing techniques. In addition, the effect of diflunisal, a well characterized stabilizer of the TTR tetramer (31Miller S.R. Sekijima Y. Kelly J.W. Lab. Invest. 2004; 84: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 32Adamski-Werner S.L. Palaninathan S.K. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 355-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), on the s¯ isotherm has been investigated. Finally, the possibility of using this technique directly in a complex biological fluid has been investigated by analyzing the sedimentation profile of fluorescein-labeled TTR in human serum. Reagents—Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate (FITC “Isomer I”) was purchased from Invitrogen. Diflunisal (5-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-hydroxybenzoic acid), ovalbumin, and DMSO were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were from Fisher and were of the highest quality available. Human serum was obtained with institutional approval, in accordance with current institutional review board protocols. Protein Sample Preparation—Recombinant human transthyretin (rTTR) was prepared and S-sulfonated (rTTR-SO3H) or S-cysteinylated (rTTR-Cys) as previously described (33Kingsbury J.S. Klimtchuk E.S. Théberge R. Costello C.E. Connors L.H. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 53: 370-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Each preparation demonstrated >95% homogeneity within experimental error (∼4 units) of the expected molecular weight (rTTR, Mr 13761; rTTR-SO3H, Mr 13841; rTTR-Cys, Mr 13880) as assessed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (see below). The three recombinant proteins were then chemically coupled to the amine-reactive 5-isothiocyanate derivative of fluorescein (FITC). Solutions of 5 mg of each protein were exchanged into 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 9, using EconoPak 10-DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad), and the volumes were adjusted to 3 ml (final concentration, 1.7 mg/ml). FITC was dissolved in dimethyl formamide at 10 mg/ml, and 100 μl was added to each protein solution. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The unreacted free dye was removed, and the samples were exchanged into 100 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using EconoPak 10-DG desalting columns. Concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 280 nm using E1%280, 14.1 ml mg–1 cm–1 (34Raz A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 3230-3237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The signal was corrected for the absorbance of the dye by the following equation, Aprotein = A280−A494×CF280 Eq. 1 where Aprotein is the corrected protein absorbance at 280 nm, A280 is the measured absorbance of the conjugate at 280 nm, A494 is the measured absorbance of the conjugate at 494 nm, and CF280 is the correction factor, 0.30, as tabulated for fluorescein by Invitrogen. Samples were diluted to 0.5 mg/ml and stored at –20 °C until use. Sample quality and protein/dye stoichiometry were determined by ESI-MS and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as described below. Molar concentrations are reported in reference to the physiologic tetrameric species. For sedimentation analysis of FITC-labeled rTTR species (F-rTTR, F-rTTR-SO3H, and F-rTTR-Cys), stock solutions (0.5 mg/ml) were diluted to 6.25 μg/ml in 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 100 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 7 or 9. A 2-fold dilution series was then constructed, using the same buffer, over the range 6.25 μg/ml to 12.2 ng/ml. For analysis of drug binding, diflunisal was dissolved to 10 mg/ml in DMSO and then diluted 1:100 in 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, 100 mm potassium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 9, and used for a 2-fold dilution series of F-rTTR over the protein concentration range 6.25 μg/ml to 48.8 ng/ml. For the control, DMSO was used instead of the stock diflunisal solution. For measurement of sedimentation in serum, stock F-rTTR was diluted to 6.25 μg/ml in human serum. All samples were equilibrated for ∼1 h at room temperature and then ∼1 h in the centrifuge vacuum chamber at experimental rotor temperature before sedimentation was initiated. ESI-MS—Samples were prepared for mass spectrometry by reversed phase HPLC. Approximately 5 μg of each sample was loaded onto a Zorbax Poroshell 300SB-C8 HPLC column (75 mm long, 2.1-mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle size) that was pre-equilibrated in 95% solvent A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) and 5% solvent B (0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The column was eluted with a 5-min linear increase in solvent B to 85% at 1 ml/min. The entire protein peak, as indicated by A210, was collected, dried in a centrifugal concentrator (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY), and stored at –20 °C until analysis. The samples were dissolved in 10 μl of 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid in water and loaded into 1-μm aperture nanospray tips prepared in house using a Sutter (Novato, CA) capillary puller and 1.2 × 76-mm thin wall borosilicate glass capillaries (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The samples were introduced into a Micromass Quattro II triple quadrupole mass spectrometer by continuous nanospray generated with the following instrument settings: ion source block temperature, 120 °C; capillary potential, ∼1200 V; cone potential, 32 V; extractor potential, 7 V; RF lens potential, 0.2 V. The raw data, collected over the range m/z 200–1950, were deconvoluted (35Mann M. Meng C.K. Fenn J.B. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 1702-1708Crossref Scopus (543) Google Scholar) using the MAXENT function of the MASSLYNX (version 3.4) software. The protein/dye stoichiometries of the F-rTTR conjugates were determined by the following equation, Mr,conj=Mr+(Mr,dye×n) Eq. 2 where Mr,conj is the neutral mass of the conjugate determined experimentally, Mr is the neutral mass of the initial species (rTTR, 13761; rTTR-SO3H, 13841; rTTR-Cys, 13880), Mr,dye is the neutral mass of FITC (389, with no change in mass upon coupling), and n is the number of dye molecules bound per molecule of initial species. Tryptic Digestion/LC-MS/MS—Reversed phase HPLC-purified F-rTTR (2.4 μg) was incubated with a 1:100 enzyme-to-substrate ratio of trypsin gold, mass spectrometry grade (Promega, Madison, WI) in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, for 17 h at 37 °C. The reaction was neutralized with 1 μl of 10% formic acid and dried in a centrifugal concentrator. Dried samples were resuspended at ∼2 pm in 3% acetonitrile in water and analyzed with a LTQ-Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) coupled with a Waters NanoAcquity Ultra Performance LC (Waters Corp., Milford, MA) equipped with a 100 μm × 10 cm C18 capillary. The capillary was equilibrated at 97% solvent C (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water), 3% solvent D (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) prior to sample application. After loading, peptides were eluted from the capillary at 500 nl/min with a linear increase in solvent D from 3 to 60% over 37 min, followed by a second increase from 60 to 80% over 10 min. Continuous electrospray was initiated at 140 V with the heated capillary set at 320 °C. For MS/MS analyses, each ion of interest was isolated with an isolation window of 3.0 Da and fragmented by collision-induced dissociation with normalized collision energy of 35%. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Circular dichroism spectroscopy experiments were conducted with an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Biomedical, Lakewood, NJ) equipped with a nitrogen-purged sample holder held at 25 °C with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Samples (12 μm in 10 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, pH 7 or 9) were loaded into 1-mm path length quartz cuvettes for far UV experiments or 5-mm path length quartz cuvettes for near UV experiments. Data were collected in 1-nm increments (1-nm band width) over the spectral range of 190–250 nm (far UV experiments) and 250–320 nm (near UV experiments) with an averaging time of typically 20–30 s. The CD spectra were presented in ellipticity units per mole of residue for far UV experiments and per mole of protein for near UV experiments. Far UV spectra were smoothed using the Aviv noise reduction routine. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation velocity experiments were conducted with an Optima XLI analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) retrofitted with a prototype fluorescence optical system (commercial version available from Aviv Biomedical). Samples were loaded into ultracentrifuge cells containing graphite-filled epoxy SedVel60K sedimentation velocity centerpieces (Spin Analytical, Durham, NH) and fused silica optical windows. The centrifuge and data acquisition were controlled with the Advanced Operating System (AU-AOS). For all experiments, samples were centrifuged in an An50-Ti rotor at 50,000 rpm with the temperature held at 20 °C. Data were acquired at 20-μm radial increments, averaging 5 revolutions/scan. The photomultiplier gain and the programmable gain amplifier were set for each cell to minimize noise while providing adequate signal for data analysis (>100 fluorescence units, determined visually and set at 3,000 rpm). Analysis of Sedimentation Data—Sedimentation velocity data were analyzed using the program SEDFIT (version 9.4) (36Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar) (available on the World Wide Web). The s¯ value of each data set was determined in two steps. First, the continuous c(s) distribution model (36Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 37Dam J. Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 651-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) with 68% confidence level was used to generate the best fit of the data. In addition, an estimate of s¯ was obtained by integration of the resulting distribution (36Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar). Second, using the best fit parameters from the c(s) distribution, the Monte Carlo simulation routine of the analysis package was used to calculate s¯ and the associated error interval. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) of each data set was calculated by the following equation, S/N=20×log(AsignalAnoise)Eq. 3 where Asignal is the amplitude of the fluorescence signal determined by subtracting the base-line signal from the plateau signal of the first scan, and Anoise is the amplitude of the time- and position-invariant noise determined by the r.m.s.d. of the finite element fit. For modeling of isotherm data, the s¯ values determined in SEDFIT were converted to standardized s¯20, W values (s¯ in water at 20 °C) using the program SEDNTERP (version 1.08, available on the World Wide Web). In these calculations, buffer viscosity (ηB) and density (ρB) at 20 °C (experimental temperature) were estimated from composition: ηB = 0.01469 poise, ρB = 1.00325 g/ml. For water, standard parameters were assumed: ηW = 0.01002 poise, ρW = 0.99823 g/ml. The partial specific volume (v¯) of TTR was estimated as 0.7324 ml/g (at 20 °C) from composition. The s¯20, W isotherms were modeled using the program SEDPHAT (28Schuck P. Anal.

Models for monomer-tetramer (1→4) and monomerdimer-tetramer (1→2→4) self-association were applied and assessed for appropriateness by the F-statistic, F=χ1→42χ1→2→42Eq. 4 where χ1→42 and χ1→2→42 are the χ values for the fits to the two respective models. In each case, the calculated value was compared with the value of F = 3.39 (α = 0.05) tabulated for 9 degrees of freedom (df) for the 1→4 model and 8 df for the 1→2→4 model, which were calculated as follows, df = N-p Eq. 5 where N is the number of data points (10 for both models), and p is the number of fitting variables (1 for the 1→4 model and 2 for the 1→2→4 model). In all cases, the following fitting parameters were constrained: s1, 1.8 S; s2 (in the 1→2→4 model), 2.7 S; s4, 4.6 S. Additionally, M1 values were set to the Mr determined by ESI-MS and constrained during the fit. The parameter for 4→1 dissociation reported herein, c½, is the concentration of half-dissociation and is related to the dissociation constant (KD) by the following equation, c1/2 = n-1√KD Eq. 6 where n is the stoichiometry of the self-association. For the analysis of sedimentation in serum, s was determined qualitatively from the slope of a plot of the natural log of the relative radial boundary position (ln r/rm) as a function of the angular velocity squared multiplied by the time of the given scan (ω2t). The radial boundary position (r) was determined as the half-height of the plateau region for each scan, whereas the meniscus position (rm) was determined visually and used as a constant for all analyzed scans. In addition, s was determined from the continuous c(s) distribution (36Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar, 37Dam J.

According to most models of TTR fibrillogenesis, only monomeric TTR misfolds into amyloid fibrils. Consequently, the TTR tetramer must dissociate prior to amyloid formation. To investigate the effect of biologically relevant cysteine adducts on TTR tetramer stability and their potential role as modulators of amyloid formation, fluorescent derivatives of unmodified, S-sulfonated, and S-cysteinylated rTTR were prepared, and self-association isotherms were determined by fluorescence-detected analytical ultracentrifugation. In vivo, TTR tetramers are probably composed of a mixture of Cys10-modified species. However, to simplify the interpretation of the data, homotetramers of each form were studied. Each form of rTTR was coupled to FITC, an amine-reactive form of fluorescein. TTR contains nine potential conjugation sites (primary amines) for FITC per monomer (eight lysine residues and the N-terminal glycine residue). This allows a significant possibility for sample heterogeneity, which may complicate interpretation of dissociation. To characterize the heterogeneity introduced by fluorescent probe derivatization, several different mass spectrometric approaches were employed. ESI-MS was conducted on each fluorescent derivative, and in each case, a single predominant species was identified with an observed neutral mass consistent with the mass expected for a product with a 1:1 dye/monomer stoichiometry (F-rTTR, Mr 14150; F-rTTR-SO3H, Mr 14230; F-rTTR-Cys, Mr 14270). Minor species corresponding to unconjugated as well as 2:1 dye/monomer stoichiometry were also observed in all three cases, although these impurities were estimated to account for <15% of the total sample preparation. In addition, a minor species of Mr 14230 was observed in the F-rTTR sample, possibly indicating the presence of a small amount of S-sulfonation or other contaminant. The conjugation site specificity of the 1:1 dye/monomer product was determined by LC-MS/MS analysis of a tryptic digestion of F-rTTR. An abundant ion corresponding to the mass of the derivatized N-terminal tryptic peptide (FITC-Gly1-Lys9) was observed at m/z 611.72 [M + 2H]2+ (calculated m/z 611.72 [M + 2H]2+). The most abundant product ions observed in the MS/MS spectrum of this precursor ion were m/z 390.10 and m/z 833.45, which can be assigned as the protonated free label (calculated m/z 390.04 [M + H]+) and underivatized N-terminal tryptic peptide (calculated m/z 833.40 [M + H]+), respectively. The observance of these ions is consistent with reports that the fluorescein adduct is labile under collisional activation conditions (38Schnaible V. Pryzbylski M. Bioconjugate Chem. 1999; 10: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Although the MS/MS spectrum did not contain a fragment that specifically located the site of conjugation, observance of the FITC-Gly1–Lys9 tryptic peptide provides sufficient evidence to confidently assign the primary labeling site to the N-terminal glycine residue, since modification of Lys9 would have prevented tryptic digestion at this site (39Teske C.A.

https://openalex.org/W1996491909,"We have examined the interaction parameters, conformation, and functional significance of the human MutSα· proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) complex in mismatch repair. The two proteins associate with a 1:1 stoichiometry and a KD of 0.7 μm in the absence or presence of heteroduplex DNA. PCNA does not influence the affinity of MutSα for a mismatch, and mismatch-bound MutSα binds PCNA. Small angle x-ray scattering studies have established the molecular parameters of the complex, which are consistent with an elongated conformation in which the two proteins associate in an end-to-end fashion in a manner that does not involve an extended unstructured tether, as has been proposed for yeast MutSα and PCNA (Shell, S. S., Putnam, C. D., and Kolodner, R. D. (2007) Mol. Cell 26, 565-578). MutSα variants lacking the PCNA interaction motif are functional in 3′- or 5′-directed mismatch-provoked excision, but display a partial defect in 5′-directed mismatch repair. This finding is consistent with the modest mutability conferred by inactivation of the MutSα PCNA interaction motif and suggests that interaction of the replication clamp with other repair protein(s) accounts for the essential role of PCNA in MutSα-dependent mismatch repair.

Mismatch repair rectifies DNA biosynthetic errors, mediates several recombination-associated phenomena, and in mammalian cells participates in an early step of the cellular response to certain classes of DNA damage (reviewed in Refs. 1Iyer R.R.

Defects in the human pathway are the cause of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and have been implicated in the development of a subset of sporadic tumors. A strand-specific mismatch repair reaction that is presumably responsible for replication error correction has been studied in mammalian cell extracts and in several purified systems. A number of activities have been implicated in this pathway, including MutSα (MSH2·MSH6 heterodimer), MutSβ (MSH2·MSH3), MutLα (MLH1·PMS2), Exo1, replication protein A, HMGB1, PCNA, 2The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; SPRS, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. 2The abbreviations used are: PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; RFC, replication factor C; SPRS, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; SAXS, small angle x-ray scattering. RFC, and DNA polymerase δ. This reaction can be conceptually divided into three steps: mismatch recognition, excision, and repair DNA synthesis/ligation. The replication clamp PCNA functions at several stages of this multistep reaction. It participates in the DNA synthesis phase of repair (3Gu L. Hong Y. McCulloch S. Watanabe H. Li G.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1173-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), consistent with its function as a cofactor for DNA polymerase δ (4Johnson A. O'Donnell M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 283-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). PCNA is also necessary during an early step of the reaction (5Umar A. Buermeyer A.B. Simon J.A. Thomas D.C. Clark A.B.

However, the significance of these various PCNA interactions is not clear. Analysis of PCNA involvement in mismatch repair has emphasized the MutSα·PCNA complex, which has been suggested to be a key intermediate in mismatch repair. A conserved QXX(L/I)XXFF motif near the N terminus of MSH6 has been implicated in this interaction (6Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat.

A human MutSα variant lacking the MSH6 N-terminal 77 amino acids including the QXX(L/I)XXFF motif is severely compromised in its ability to support mismatch repair in vitro (8Kleczkowska H.E. Marra G. Lettieri T. Jiricny J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 724-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), but alanine substitution of conserved residues within the PCNA interaction motif of yeast Msh6 results in only a modest increase in mutability (6Clark A.B. Valle F. Drotschmann K. Gary R.K. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36498-36501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 7Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The implications of the MutSα-PCNA interaction for the mechanism of mismatch repair are also uncertain. Biochemical analyses have indicated that yeast PCNA enhances the specific affinity of yeast MutSα for a mismatch (7Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), but a subsequent study concluded that although PCNA, MutSα, and homoduplex DNA form a stable ternary complex, binding to a mismatch leads to disruption of the MutSα-PCNA interaction (12Lau P.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These two conclusions appear to be at odds with thermodynamic expectations: if PCNA increases the affinity of MutSα for a mispair, then a mismatch should increase the affinity of PCNA for MutSα. This study further clarifies the nature and function of the human MutSα-PCNA interaction. We show that MutSα binds PCNA with a stoichiometry of 1:1, adopting an elongated conformation in solution, and that the affinity of this interaction is not significantly affected by mismatch binding. Abrogation of the MutSα-PCNA interaction has little effect on 5′- or 3′-directed mismatch-provoked excision. However, 5′-directed repair is partially attenuated under these conditions. MutSα-expressing Baculoviral Constructs—A baculoviral expression vector that expresses full-length MSH2 and an N-terminally truncated form of MSH6 (MSH6Δ12) was prepared by PCR mutagenesis from the previously described pFastbacDual-MSH2-MSH6 (13Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The resulting pFastbacDual-MSH2-MSH6Δ12 encodes amino acids 13-1361 of full-length MSH6, beginning with NH2-Met-Pro-Lys-Ser, and was used to generate a baculovirus according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Recombinant virus was plaque-purified, and high titer stocks were produced, which were used to infect Sf9 insect cells for protein expression. DNAs and Proteins—Circular heteroduplex DNAs contained a single G-T mismatch (A·T in homoduplex controls) and a strand discontinuity located either 3′ or 5′ to the mismatch (9Dzantiev L. Constantin N. Genschel J. Iyer R.R. Burgers P.M. Modrich P. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The DNAs used in SPRS, magnetic bead assays, and equilibrium gel filtration were 21-, 41-, or 201-bp duplexes containing a centrally located G-T mismatch (or A·T base pair) flanked by sequences corresponding to those in the circular substrates described above (13Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). For nitrocellulose filter binding assays, synthetic 41-bp hetero- and homoduplex DNAs were prepared by annealing high pressure liquid chromatography-purified 5′-32P-labeled T-containing strand with an equimolar amount of unlabeled purified A- or G-containing strand. The substrates used in SPRS and magnetic bead assays contained a 5′-biotin tag on the T-containing strand. Recombinant MutSα, MSH2·Δ12 (referred to below as MutSαΔ12), and MutLα were isolated according to Blackwell et al. (13Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and MSH2·Δ341 (referred to below as MutSαΔ341) according to Warren et al. (14Warren J.J. Pohlhaus T.J.

Isolates of MutSα and its variants typically contained ∼1 mol of ADP/mol of heterodimer. Exo1 and replication protein A (16Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 230-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) were isolated as described. MutSα and PCNA concentrations, which are expressed as heterodimer and homotrimer equivalents, respectively, were determined by the method of Gill and von Hippel (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar), which yielded extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 208,465 (MutSα), 206,975 (MutSαΔ12), 171,650 (MutSαΔ341), and 50,040 (PCNA) m-1 cm-1. Analyses of Protein·Protein and Protein·DNA Assemblies—Gel filtration at 4 °C employed a 2.4-ml Superdex 200 PC 3.2 column on anÄKTA Purifier 10 HPLC system (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5 (or 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The column was calibrated using blue dextran (excluded volume) and standards of known Stokes radii (GE Healthcare): apoferritin (67.1 Å), aldolase (48.1 Å), and albumin (35.5 Å). For equilibrium gel filtration, the Superdex 200 column was equilibrated with PCNA as indicated (or a mixture of PCNA and a 21-bp G-T heteroduplex). A 10-μl sample of MutSα in equilibration buffer was injected, and the column was developed at 0.02 ml/min. The eluate was monitored at 280, 260, and 230 nm as indicated and/or collected in 0.025-ml fractions, which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bead-linked DNA assay was used to score MutSα·PCNA complexes on DNA. A slurry of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidincoated magnetic beads (1 ml; Invitrogen) was derivatized by resuspension in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, and 1 mm EDTA containing 1 nmol of 41-bp homoduplex or G-T heteroduplex DNA. For binding assays, 18 μl of derivatized beads were washed and resuspended in 90 μl of 25 m m HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm KCl containing 400 nm MutSα and 1 μm PCNA. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, beads were collected and washed with assay buffer, and bound protein was eluted with 25 μl of 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, and 400 mm NaCl, followed by SDS-PAGE analysis. MutSα binding to 41-bp homoduplex and heteroduplex DNAs was scored by the DEAE-nitrocellulose paper double-filter method (21Wong I. Lohman T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5428-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Reactions (50 μl) contained 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 nm 32P-labeled 41-bp G-T heteroduplex or A·T homoduplex DNA, and MutSα and PCNA as indicated. After 20 min at 4 °C, the solution was applied to a stacked filter set, which had been prewashed twice with 100 μl of binding buffer, and drawn through under 30 kilopascals of vacuum. Nitrocellulose and DEAE filters were dried, and radioactivity bound to each was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. SPRS was performed on a Biacore 2000. Interaction of MutSα or p21 with PCNA in the absence of DNA was analyzed in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 125 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA using a Ni2+-NTA chip derivatized with His6-PCNA (100-200 response units). Interaction of PCNA with DNA-bound MutSα was evaluated by two-phase protein flow (20 μl/min) over a streptavidin chip derivatized with biotin-tagged 201-bp homoduplex or heteroduplex DNA in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.02% surfactant P20, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. In the first phase, 200 nm MutSα was allowed to flow for 5 min, followed immediately by a second phase wherein 200 nm MutSα supplemented with 0.025-2.5 μm PCNA was allowed to flow for an additional 5 min. SAXS Experiments—SAXS was performed on Sibyls beam-line 12.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source. Protein samples were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Scattering intensities (I) were determined at multiple protein concentrations (10-50 μm) as a function of the scattering vector Q = 4πsinθ/λ, where 2θ is the scattering angle, and λ is the wavelength of the incident beam, and corrected for background scattering using dialysis buffer. Forward scattering intensities (I(0)) were calculated from Guinier plots (ln I versus Q2) (22Guinier A. Fournet G. Small-angle Scattering of X-rays. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1955Google Scholar) of scattering data normalized for concentration (mass/volume). Radii of gyration (Rg) were determined by Guinier plot from scattering curves extrapolated to zero concentration using the program PRIMUS (23Konarev P.V. Volkov V.V. Sokolova A.V. Koch M.H. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 1277-1282Crossref Scopus (2273) Google Scholar). Composite scattering curves were generated with PRIMUS by scaling and merging background-corrected high Q region data from higher concentration samples (20-50 μm) with low Q region zero-extrapolated data. Scattering curves were subjected to indirect Fourier transform using the GNOM program (24Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1992; 25: 495-503Crossref Scopus (2872) Google Scholar) to yield the pair distribution function (P(r)), from which maximum particle dimensions (Dmax) and Rg were derived (25Nagar B.

GNOM output files were also used to generate low resolution ab initio models of the proteins using the dummy atom approach as implemented in DAM-MIN (26Svergun D.I. Biophys.

Individual models were aligned by SUPCOMB (28Kozin M.B. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2001; 34: 33-41Crossref Scopus (1068) Google Scholar) and averaged by DAMAVER (29Volkov V.V. Svergun D.I. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 860-864Crossref Scopus (1578) Google Scholar) to yield the most probable conformation.

However, preincubation of MutSα (1-8 μm) with PCNA (1-16 μm) followed by gel filtration of the mixture failed to indicate interaction of the two proteins as judged by UV elution profile, and we were unable to detect PCNA in column fractions containing MutSα by SDS gel electrophoresis (data not shown).TABLE 1Biophysical properties of MutSα and PCNA derived from SAXS and gel filtrationSampleMolecular massSAXSGel filtration, Stokes radiusRg calculatedRg GuinierRg P(r)DmaxkDaÅÅMutSα25859 ± 157 ± 0.220267MutSαΔ1225657 ± 0.458 ± 0.119967MutSαΔ34122046 ± 0.346 ± 0.114560MutSαΔ341·G-T2304244 ± 0.143 ± 0.1140 (130)PCNA863433 ± 0.134 ± 0.192 (97)40MutSα + PCNA (1:1)34369 ± 0.567 ± 0.323480 Open table in a new tab These findings suggested that the MutSα-PCNA interaction is characterized by a modest affinity and/or a short lifetime. We therefore examined this interaction by equilibrium gel filtration (34Ackers G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A Superdex 200 column pre-equilibrated with a uniform concentration of PCNA was injected with a known amount of MutSα. Association of MutSα and PCNA results in depletion of PCNA at its retention volume, which is manifested as a trough in UV absorbance. The amount of PCNA bound to MutSα was determined from the area of the trough and extinction coefficients of the two proteins. Fig. 1A shows elution profiles for filtration of a 10-μl sample of 8 μm MutSα on a column preequilibrated with 0.25-1.5 μm PCNA. Trough areas at the PCNA elution volume (∼1.35 ml) were used to determine the moles of PCNA bound per mol of MutSα. A plot of these values against PCNA concentration fit well to a hyperbola with a KD of 0.7 μm and a stoichiometry of 1.0 PCNA trimer/recombinant MutSα heterodimer (Fig. 1B). Essentially identical values (0.8 μm and 1:0.94) were obtained using MutSα isolated from HeLa cells. These results were verified by SPRS analyses in which excess recombinant MutSα was flowed over a Ni2+-NTA chip containing immobilized His6-PCNA (Fig. 1C). Such experiments yielded a KD of 0.5 μm and a stoichiometry of 1 MutSα heterodimer/PCNA trimer. By contrast, analysis of recombinant p21 binding to a His6-PCNA chip at a concentration several hundred times the KD yielded a stoichiometry of three molecules of p21/PCNA trimer (Fig. 1C, inset), consistent with previous findings (35Flores-Rozas H. Kelman Z. Dean F.B. Pan Z.Q. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. O'Donnell M. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8655-8659Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). MutSα·PCNA Complex Formation Requires the PCNA Interaction Motif of MSH6—The MSH6 polypeptide contains distinct structural domains (Fig. 2A) and harbors a PCNA interaction motif (QXX(L/I)XXFF) near the N terminus that has been implicated in MutSα-PCNA interaction (6Clark A.B.

To evaluate the contributions of this motif to interaction affinity and biological function, we prepared MutSα derivatives lacking this motif: MutSαΔ341 (14Warren J.J. Pohlhaus T.J. Changela A. Iyer R.R. Modrich P.L. Beese L.S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 579-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) and MutSαΔ12 (see “Experimental Procedures”). Both form stable heterodimers, and the structure of MutSαΔ341 is known (14Warren J.J. Pohlhaus T.J. Changela A. Iyer R.R. Modrich P.L. Beese L.S. Mol. Cell. 2007; 26: 579-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The Stokes radii of MutSαΔ12 and MutSαΔ341 were determined by gel filtration chromatography to be 67 and 60 Å, respectively (Table 1), consistent with the previously determined Stokes radius of native MutSα (15Drummond J.T. Li G.M. Longley M.J. Modrich P. Science. 1995; 268: 1909-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). This finding and the results of SAXS and DNA binding studies described below suggest that deletion of the PCNA-binding motif does not significantly alter the conformation or stability of MutSα. The capacity of MutSαΔ12 to bind PCNA was also examined by equilibrium gel filtration (Fig. 2B). Interaction of the two proteins was not detectable by this method (Fig. 1B), indicating that deletion of the N-terminal PCNA-binding motif of MSH6 reduces the interaction affinity of the two proteins by at least 10-fold. The PCNA-binding defects of MutSαΔ12 and MutSαΔ341 were also assessed by pulldown assay using magnetic beads derivatized with G-T heteroduplex or A·T homoduplex DNA (Fig. 2C). Binding of PCNA to A·T or G-T beads in the absence of other proteins was not detectable (lanes 1 and 2). However, PCNA was captured by G-T beads if MutSα was present (lane 4) and was also retained at low levels on A·T beads in the presence of MSH2·MSH6 (lane 3). Although the extent of retention of MutSαΔ341 and MutSαΔ12 by the bead-linked DNAs was comparable with that of native MutSα, PCNA was not detectably retained in the presence of either of the truncated proteins (lanes 5-8). Affinity and Stoichiometry of the DNA·MutSα·PCNA Complex—The influence of DNA binding by MutSα on its ability to associate with PCNA was also assessed by equilibrium gel filtration and SPRS. Fig. 3A shows elution profiles for filtration of a 10-μl sample of 4 μm MutSα through a column pre-equilibrated with a 21-bp G-T heteroduplex (800 nm) and variable concentrations of PCNA. Absorbance profiles showed the presence of two troughs representing simultaneous depletion of PCNA and DNA, due to their association with MutSα. Measurement of trough areas revealed that 1 heteroduplex was bound per MutSα heterodimer. Binding of PCNA to the MutSα·DNA complex was hyperbolic with respect to PCNA concentration, characterized by a KD of 0.6 μm and a stoichiometry of 1:1:1 for the DNA·MutSα·PCNA complex (Fig. 3B). PCNA interaction with DNA-bound MutSα was also examined by SPRS using 201-bp G-T and A·T DNAs (supplemental Fig. 1A). Supplementation of a 200 nm MutSα flow with 2.5 μm PCNA over a heteroduplex-derivatized sensor chip resulted in an increase in bound mass above that observed with MutSα alone. This mass increase displayed saturation behavior with increasing PCNA concentration, with a limiting stoichiometry corresponding to 1 PCNA trimer/MutSα heterodimer (supplemental Fig. 1B) and an apparent KD of 100 nm. Mismatch dependence of MutSα binding under these conditions was 3-4-fold, and no significant PCNA binding to the DNA chip was observed in the absence of MutSα (supplemental Fig. 1A). The KD for PCNA binding to DNA-bound MutSα observed in these experiments is significantly less than that obtained by equilibrium gel filtration. This may be due to the restricted order of ternary complex assembly in the SPRS experiments (PCNA binding to DNA-bound MutSα as opposed to the gel filtration experiments, in which MutSα can bind either PCNA or DNA prior to ternary complex assembly). However, the KD difference could also be due to avidity and/or rebinding effects in SPRS experiments. Such effects, which have been previously observed in biosensor studies involving flow of a multivalent biomolecule like PCNA over a surface derivatized with a monovalent binding partner, result in anomalously high apparent affinities (36Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). A previous study indicated that yeast PCNA increases the affinity of yeast MutSα for a mismatch (7Flores-Rozas H. Clark D. Kolodner R.D. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 375-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that although yeast PCNA forms a complex with homoduplex-bound yeast MutSα, the trimeric clamp is excluded from the yeast MutSα·mismatch complex (12Lau P.J. Kolodner R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because these two conclusions are at odds with thermodynamic expectations and because we have found that human PCNA binds readily to the MutSα·mismatch complex, we used a nitrocellulose membrane assay to evaluate the effects of human PCNA on the heteroduplex and homoduplex affinities of human MutSα. As shown in Fig. 3C, the affinities and mismatch dependence of DNA binding by MutSα were comparable when determined in the absence or presence of a large excess of the replication clamp. SAXS Studies of MutSα, PCNA, and the MutSα·PCNA Complex—We used SAXS to probe solution conformations of native MutSα and the MutSα·PCNA complex. Fig. 4A shows solution x-ray scattering profiles (I versus Q) for MutSα, MutSαΔ12, MutSαΔ341, PCNA, and MutSαΔ341 complexed to a 15-bp G-T heteroduplex. The corresponding distributions of pairwise interatomic vectors (P(r)) were obtained from scattering profiles by indirect Fourier transform (Fig. 4B). The model-independent conformational parameters Rg and Dmax obtained from these analyses are summarized in Table 1. For PCNA and the MutSαΔ341·DNA complex, scattering profiles (supplemental Fig. 2A) and Rg and Dmax parameters were calculated from available crystal structures, with the resulting values in good agreement with those determined by SAXS. As observed previously for Sulfolobus solfataricus PCNA (37Pascal J.M. Tsodikov O.V. Hura G.L. Song W. Cotner E.A. Classen S. Tomkinson A.E. Tainer J.A. Ellenberger T. Mol.

ENaC mediates apical membrane Na+ transport across high resistance epithelia in numerous tissues, including kidney, colon, and lung. ENaC, a heterotrimeric channel composed of α, β, and γ subunits, is involved in the maintenance of extracellular volume and blood pressure, absorption of fluid from the lungs during late stages of gestation, and electrolyte homeostasis (2Rossier B.C.

Gain of function human ENaC (hENaC) mutations result in hypertension because of increased renal Na+ reabsorption in Liddle's syndrome (4Schild L. Canessa C.M. Shimkets R.A. Gautschi I. Lifton R.P.

The diuretic amiloride inhibits transepithelial Na+ transport across reabsorptive epithelia by blocking apical membrane ENaC function (8Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C131-C145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of amiloride yielding 50% ENaC inhibition (IC50) is ∼100 nm, whereas the more potent and specific derivatives phenamil and benzamil exhibit IC50 values ∼10 nm. Thus, high affinity ENaC blockers have been identified (9Hirsh A.J. Molino B.F. Zhang J. Astakhova N. Geiss W.B. Sargent B.J. Swenson B.D. Usyatinsky A. Wyle M.J. Boucher R.C. Smith R.T. Zamurs A.

Molecules reported to increase ENaC Na+ transport, such as glybenclamide, CPT-cAMP, capsazepine, and icilin, all suffer from low efficacy, low specificity, and/or lack of effect on wild-type αβγ hENaC. Glybenclamide, an inhibitor of members of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the sulfonylurea receptor, increased amiloride-sensitive ENaC current by 50–100% (apparent concentration yielding 50% ENaC activation (EC50) of 45 μm) in Xenopus oocytes and A6 kidney cells; glybenclamide activation of ENaC required the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the α subunit and doubled the open probability of individual channels (10Chraibi A.

Acta. 2003; 1609: 170-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). It is unclear if glybenclamide effects were indirect and attributable to primary regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporters or other glybenclamide receptors that secondarily regulate ENaC activity. CPT-cAMP increased amiloride-sensitive current by ∼300% (no EC50 determined) in Xenopus oocytes expressing chimeric ENaC channels composed of guinea pig α subunits in combination with rat βγ subunits; however, CPT-cAMP had no effect on wild-type, nonchimeric ENaC channels (12Schnizler M.

Capsazepine, a nonspecific inhibitor of TRPV1, and icilin, an activator of TRPM8 temperature-sensitive nonselective cation channels, increased amiloride-sensitive current by 100–200% (apparent EC50 of 8 and 33 μm, respectively) in Xenopus oocytes expressing δ or δβγ hENaC but not α or αβγ hENaC (14Yamamura H.

Mechanistically, S3969 requires the extracellular domain of the β subunit and increases hENaC open probability, thereby augmenting flux of Na+ ions into cells. Accordingly, S3969 activated αβG37Sγ hENaC, a channel variant that exhibits reduced open probability and leads to the salt-wasting disease PHA1. Promoting hENaC-dependent Na+ and fluid transport across epithelia may find utility in modulating extracellular volume and electrolyte homeostasis in both normal and diseased states. Molecular Biology—α, β, and γ hENaC were cloned from kidney cDNA (Origene, Rockville, MD) into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) as described previously (22Callamaras N., and Chang, H. (November 7, 2002) Patent PCT WO 2002087306 A2Google Scholar). δ hENaC was cloned from testis cDNA (Clontech). Mouse α, β, and γ kidney ENaC (mENaC) clones were obtained from Thomas Kleyman (University of Pittsburgh) and subcloned into pcDNA3. βS520C hENaC (activated by MTSET), αR178A/R181A/R204A hENaC (furin variant), γR138A hENaC (furin variant), βG37S hENaC (PHA1 variant), and αR508X hENaC (PHA1 variant) were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. To ensure that no errors occurred during mutagenesis, all constructs were sequenced and subcloned into new pcDNA3 vector backbones that did not go through the QuikChange process. β hENaC and β mENaC chimeras were constructed using overlapping PCR with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) to amplify individual fragments and PCR SuperMix High Fidelity (Invitrogen) to amplify overlapping products. Chimeras, summarized in Table 1, were sequenced to confirm desired junctions and the absence of other mutations introduced during amplification.TABLE 1Summary of β ENaC chimerasβ ChimeraHuman regionHuman amino acidsMouse regionMouse amino acidsH-MN-term, TMD11-71ECL, TMD2, C-term72-638H-M-HN-term, TMD1, TMD2, C-term1-71; 534-640ECL72-531M-HECL, TMD2, C-term72-640N-term, TMD11-71M-H-MECL72-533N-term, TMD1, TMD2, C-term1-71, 532-638 Open table in a new tab In Vitro Transcription—ENaC cRNA was generated from linearized plasmids using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit with T7 RNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Ambion, Austin, TX). cRNA quality was checked by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometric absorbance readings at 260 and 280 nm to ensure that full-length, nondegraded cRNA was generated. Frog Surgery, Oocyte Isolation, and Microinjection—Female Xenopus laevis South African clawed frogs greater than or equal to 9 cm in length were obtained from NASCO (Fort Atkinson, WI). Frogs were anesthetized in 0.15% ethyl-3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate (Sigma) in distilled water and placed on ice. Using sterile surgical tools, sequential 1–2-cm incisions were made in the abdomen through both the outer skin layer and the inner peritoneal layer to reveal the ovaries. Excised ovarian lobes (containing 1000–2000 oocytes) were placed in OR-2 calcium-free media (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with NaOH) and sequentially digested with 2 mg/ml collagenase type IA (Sigma), prepared immediately before use, for 45 min followed by 1 mg/ml collagenase type IA for 15 min on a rocking platform at room temperature. After enzymatic digestion, at which point the majority of oocytes are released from the ovarian lobes, oocytes were thoroughly rinsed in OR-2 without collagenase and transferred to a Petri dish containing Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; Specialty Media, Phillipsburg, NJ) supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate. Mature stage V or VI oocytes (∼1 mm diameter) were selected for microinjection. Frog skin was closed using a C6 needle with a 3-0 black braid suture (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA), and frogs were reused for subsequent oocyte isolations following a 2–3-month recovery period. Oocytes were microinjected in the animal pole with 10–15 nl containing 1 ng of each ENaC subunit cRNA. Following microinjection, oocytes were incubated in Barth's solution supplemented with 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate at 18 °C overnight. Two-electrode Voltage Clamping—ENaC function was measured using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique on an OpusXpress 6000A parallel oocyte voltage clamp system (MDS Analytical Technologies) 24-h post-microinjection unless noted otherwise. The OpusXpress system is an integrated work station that allows electrophysiological recordings to be made from up to eight oocytes simultaneously. This system has been used previously to examine the function of ion channels, including nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonin 5HT3 receptors as well as CFTR (23Papke R.L. Meyer E.M. Lavieri S.

Oocyte impalement is automated, and compound delivery is performed by a computer-controlled fluid handler; compounds are removed from 96-well plates using disposable pipette tips and applied to individual oocytes. Oocytes were placed in the OpusXpress system and perfused with ND-96 solution (96 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with NaOH). Oocytes were then impaled with voltage-sensing and current-passing electrodes back-filled with 3 m KCl. Electrodes exhibited resistances between 2 and 10 megohms for voltage-sensing electrodes and between 0.5 and 2 megohms for current-passing electrodes. Following impalement, oocytes were voltage-clamped to –60 mV, and experimental recordings were initiated. Data were acquired at 50 Hz and low pass-filtered at 5 Hz. Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 cells were maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with glutamine (Invitrogen) containing 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) in 6% CO2-balanced air at 37 °C. CHO cells were maintained as above in Kaighn's modified FK12 Nutrient Mixture (Invitrogen) containing 10% bovine calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were subcultured by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin, 1 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution; Invitrogen) and seeded on number 1 glass coverslips (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT) coated with growth factor-reduced Matrigel (1:200; BD Biosciences) for HEK293 cells or BD BioCoat coverslips pre-coated with poly-d-lysine (BD Biosciences) for CHO cells. Transient transfection was carried out using the TransIT-293 and TransIT-CHO transfection reagents (Mirus Bio Corp., Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer's instructions. HEK-293 cells were transfected with 0.45 μg each of α, β, and γ hENaC in pcDNA3, 0.38 μg of plasmid for green fluorescent protein, and 5.2 μl of TransIT-293 transfection reagent. CHO cells were transfected with 0.3 μg each of α, β, and γ hENaC in pcDNA3, 0.25 μg of plasmid for green fluorescent protein, 0.85 μg of pUC18 carrier DNA, 4 μl of TransIT-CHO transfection reagent, and 1 μl of CHO Mojo reagent. Green fluorescent protein served as a marker to identify cells expressing hENaC for electrophysiology experiments. Whole-cell Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Whole-cell currents were acquired from cells 24–72 h post-transfection at room temperature (21–24 °C) using an Axopatch200B amplifier and DIGIDATA 1322A with pCLAMP9.2 software (MDS Analytical Technologies). Currents were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and had resistances of 3–6 megohms. The pipette solution contained the following (in mm): 105 CsF, 35 NaCl, 10 EGTA, 2 Na-ATP and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. The bath solution contained the following (in mm): 150 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4. After establishment of the whole-cell configuration, currents were measured at a holding potential of –80 mV. Single Channel Patch Clamp Electrophysiology—Single channel currents were measured at room temperature in oocytes using the outside-out patch clamp configuration. Oocytes were incubated for 5–10 min in ND-96 supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, and the vitelline membrane was peeled away using fine forceps. Single channel currents were recorded using an Axopatch200B amplifier and DIGIDATA 1322A as with whole-cell recordings. Currents were acquired at 4 kHz and low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass and fire-polished and had resistances of 8–12 megohms. Patches were voltage-clamped to a pipette potential of –80 mV. Bath solution contained 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Pipette solution contained 88 mm KCl, 9.6 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na-ATP, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. For data analysis and presentation, currents were subsequently filtered at 200 Hz in pCLAMP10.2. NPo was determined over 1–2-min intervals from idealized traces using the single channel search feature. Similar values were obtained by fitting a Gaussian to an all-points current amplitude histogram. Open probability (Po) was estimated by dividing NPo by the number of channels in the patch. Compounds—Amiloride and trypsin (salt-free, lyophilized powder, minimum 10,000 benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/mg protein, l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated) were from Sigma. MTSET was from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, Ontario, Canada) and Biotium (Hayward, CA). S3969 was diluted to appropriate concentrations in ND-96 from 100 mm stock solutions in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in experiments was <0.1%; this level of vehicle had no effect on ENaC function. Synthesis of S3969—A potassium iodide/iodine solution, prepared by mixing iodine (9.7 g, 38.2 mmol in 75 ml water) with potassium iodide (19.0 g, 114.5 mmol in 225 ml water), was added dropwise to a solution of 4-methylindole (5.0 g, 38.1 mmol) and thiourea (2.9 g, 38.1 mmol) in methanol (80 ml). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation. The crude solid was redissolved in boiling water, treated with decolorizing carbon, and filtered using filter paper. The solution was cooled to room temperature and was stored at 4 °C overnight. The resulting pale yellow crystals were collected by filtration, washed with cold water (2 times, 25 ml), and dried under vacuum to give a 69% yield of 4-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl carbamimidothioate hydroiodide. This product (1.0 g, 3.0 mmol) was mixed with 2 ml of 1.5 n NaOH, heated to 90 °C, and stirred for 30 min. 2-Bromo-4-methylpentanoic acid (0.6g, 3.1 mmol) was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for 2 h. The solution was cooled to room temperature, acidified to pH 2 with 1 n HCl, and extracted with ethyl acetate (three times, 10 ml). The combined organic layers were dried with sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by flash chromatography (dichloromethane, 5% MeOH) afforded 4-methyl-2-(4-methyl-1H-indol-3-ylthio)pentanoic acid in 75% yield as a colorless oil. This product (305.1 mg, 1.1 mmol) in dimethylformamide (4 ml) was combined with N-hydroxybenzotriazole (135.1 mg, 1.0 mmol), 1-ethyl-3-(3′-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride, (211.0 mg, 1.1 mmol), and 2-aminoethanol (61 μl, 1.0 mmol). The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h, quenched with 1 ml of water and extracted with dichloromethane (three times, 10 ml) and water. The combined organic layers were collected, dried with sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by preparative thin layer chromatography (dichloromethane/MeOH) afforded S3969 in 67% yield as an off-white powder. The identities of intermediate reaction products were confirmed by 1H NMR and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and the identity of S3969 was confirmed by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry, and elemental analysis. Statistics and Measurements—Data represent the mean ± S.E. Unless otherwise noted, experiments were performed on two to four batches of independently injected oocytes harvested from different frogs. Statistical significance between different groups was determined using an unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test. Dose-response curves were plotted, and both EC50 values and Hill coefficients were determined using GraphPad Prism version 3.02 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). Values for percent hENaC activation were calculated by dividing the magnitude of the inward current induced by S3969 by the magnitude of the inward current blocked by amiloride in the same oocyte and multiplying the ratio by 100%. The activity of S3969 was expressed as a percentage of the paired amiloride response because of variability in hENaC expression between different batches of oocytes. Amiloride was used at 1 μm for αβγ hENaC and 10 μm for δβγ hENaC in oocytes; these concentrations yield greater than 90% hENaC inhibition. Similar percent of hENaC activation ratios were obtained in oocytes expressing amiloride-sensitive currents ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 μA that were typically observed in these studies. For whole-cell patch clamp experiments, mammalian cells with amiloride-sensitive inward currents less than 1 nA were studied. Cells with amiloride-sensitive currents greater than 1 nA, suggestive of channels opened by proteolysis, responded poorly to S3969. Identification of a Small Molecule Opener of αβγ hENaC—A high throughput screen was conducted using a fluorescent membrane potential dye to identify novel compounds that open hENaC channels expressed in heterologous cells (26Servant G., Chang H., Redcrow C., Ray S., and Clark, I. (February 17, 2005) Patent PCT WO 2005014848 A2Google Scholar). When a compound opens hENaC, sodium flows into the cell resulting in cell depolarization and an increase in dye fluorescence. This study describes in detail one of the more potent compounds, termed S3969 (Fig. 1A). Chemistry optimization and structure activity relationships of S3969 functional groups will be described elsewhere. Treatment of oocytes expressing αβγ hENaC with 1 μm S3969 activated hENaC by 300.1 ± 12.2% (n = 85 determinations on separate oocyte batches using three independent synthetic preparations of S3969), and the time required for S3969 to achieve half-maximal hENaC activation was 33.1 ± 1.6 s (Fig. 1B). The maximal stimulatory effect of S3969 was reached ∼3 min following compound application, and currents returned to base line following compound washout (Fig. 1B), suggesting that interaction of S3969 with hENaC was noncovalent. Repeated application of S3969 did not result in hENaC desensitization; the ratio of hENaC activation from two successive S3969 applications was 95.0 ± 3.0% (n = 11). Amiloride inhibited current activation by S3969 demonstrating that S3969 effects were hENaC-dependent (Fig. 1C). S3969 failed to activate inward currents in sodium-free solution, indicating that S3969 responses in sodium-replete solution were attributable to sodium influx (Fig. 1D). In sodium-free solution, small outward currents, attributable to sodium efflux from oocytes, were observed; the S3969-activated outward current in sodium-free solution was 25.5 ± 5.8% (n = 11) of the inward amiloride-sensitive current in sodium-replete solution (Fig. 1D). Dose-response experiments, performed to determine the potency of S3969, revealed that the threshold for S3969 hENaC activation was ∼30 nm, and maximal hENaC activation was achieved at ∼30 μm (Fig. 1E). The apparent EC50 for S3969 activation of hENaC was 1.2 ± 0.1 μm (n = 46 determinations on separate oocyte preparations using three independent synthetic preparations of S3969) with a Hill coefficient of 1.0 ± 0.1 (Fig. 1F). Current-voltage (I-V) curves from hENaC-expressing oocytes were linear, and S3969 increased amiloride-sensitive hENaC currents at both negative and positive holding potentials (Fig. 1G). By contrast, S3969 had no effect on currents at any holding potential in uninjected oocytes, illustrating that S3969-induced currents required hENaC expression (Fig. 1H). Treatment of HEK293 or CHO cells transiently expressing αβγ hENaC with 10 μm S3969, applied by bath perfusion, activated hENaC by 357.2 ± 82.4% (n = 24) and 148 ± 50.7% (n = 10) respectively (Fig. 1, I and J), indicating that S3969 enhances hENaC in both amphibian and mammalian expression systems. The time required for S3969 to achieve half-maximal hENaC activation was 18.9 ± 1.8 s in HEK293 cells and 20.0 ± 2.3 s in CHO cells, qualitatively similar to the kinetics of hENaC activation by S3969 in oocytes. Amiloride inhibited current activation by S3969 (Fig. 1J), and S3969 did not affect currents in mock-transfected cells (data not shown), demonstrating that S3969 effects were hENaC-dependent. These results demonstrate that S3969 is a novel, potent, and reversible activator of hENaC. S3969 Activates hENaC following Removal of Amiloride—Experiments were next performed to begin to elucidate the mechanism of hENaC activation by S3969. Application of amiloride only (1 μm; Fig. 2A, treatment a) inhibited hENaC, and application of S3969 only (1 μm; Fig. 2A, treatment b) activated hENaC. Coapplication of 1 μm amiloride (a dose that yields greater than 90% hENaC inhibition) and 1 μm S3969 (a dose that yields ∼50% maximal hENaC activation) inhibited hENaC (Fig. 2A, treatment c) similar to subsequent application of 1 μm amiloride alone (Fig. 2A, treatment d). Under these conditions, the effect of the hENaC blocker amiloride was dominant to the effect of the hENaC activator S3969. Following washout of amiloride and S3969 (Fig. 2A, immediately after treatment c), current rapidly increased to levels observed when oocytes were treated with S3969 alone (Fig. 2A, treatment b) before returning to near control levels. These results suggest that amiloride dissociates from hENaC faster than S3969, resulting in immediate, albeit transient, hENaC activation following removal of both compounds. Amiloride is thought to occlude the pore of αENaC subunits in an open conformation; thus, amiloride functions as an open-state blocker (27Kelly O. Lin C. Ramkumar M. Saxena N.C. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F1279-F1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed to synchronize hENaC in the open state prior to stimulation with S3969. Oocytes were first treated with amiloride to prime hENaC in the open but occluded state (Fig. 2B, treatment b). Next, oocytes were treated with S3969 in the continued presence of amiloride (Fig. 2B, overlap of treatments b and c); no activation of hENaC was observed, consistent with data in Fig. 2A. Removal of amiloride, in the continued presence of S3969, resulted in an immediate and sustained activation of hENaC (Fig. 2B, treatment c), similar in magnitude to current activation with S3969 alone (Fig. 2B, treatment d). Quantitation of these data revealed no difference in hENaC activation when oocytes were treated with S3969 before or after amiloride priming (Fig. 2C). However, amiloride priming significantly decreased the apparent time required for S3969 to achieve half-maximal hENaC activation by a factor of 7 (from ∼35 to ∼5 s; Fig. 2D). Taken together, these data indicate that S3969 activates ENaC following removal of amiloride. S3969 Increases hENaC Open Probability—Macroscopic hENaC current is dependent on the number, single channel current, and open probability of functional hENaC channels in the plasma membrane. S3969 could activate hENaC by increasing one or more of these parameters. The immediate stimulatory effect of S3969 on hENaC function following amiloride priming (Fig. 2B) is temporally inconsistent with a mechanism whereby S3969 increases the number of hENaC channels in the plasma membrane by promoting vesicular trafficking of hENaC from an intracellular pool to the cell surface; agonist-stimulated trafficking"

Here we show that H2O2 generated by insulin in rat adipocytes impaired cAMP-mediated amplification cascade of lipolysis. These micromolar concentrations of H2O2 added before cAMP suppressed cAMP activation of type IIβ cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) holoenzyme, prevented hormone-sensitive lipase translocation from cytosol to storage droplets, and inhibited lipolysis. Similarly, H2O2 impaired activation of type IIα PKA holoenzyme from bovine heart and from that reconstituted with regulatory IIα and catalytic α subunits. H2O2 was ineffective (a) if these PKA holoenzymes were preincubated with cAMP, (b) if added to the catalytic α subunit, which is active independently of cAMP activation, and (c) if the catalytic α subunit was substituted by its C199A mutant in the reconstituted holoenzyme. H2O2 inhibition of PKA activation remained after H2O2 elimination by gel filtration but was reverted with dithiothreitol or with thioredoxin reductase plus thioredoxin. Electrophoresis of holoenzyme in SDS gels showed separation of catalytic and regulatory subunits after cAMP incubation but a single band after H2O2 incubation. These data strongly suggest that H2O2 promotes the formation of an intersubunit disulfide bond, impairing cAMP-dependent PKA activation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Cys-97 is conserved only in type II regulatory subunits and not in type I regulatory subunits; hence, the redox regulation mechanism described is restricted to type II PKA-expressing tissues. In conclusion, phylogenetic analysis results, selective chemical behavior, and the privileged position in holoenzyme lead us to suggest that Cys-97 in regulatory IIα or IIβ subunits is the residue forming the disulfide bond with Cys-199 in the PKA catalytic α subunit.

A new molecular point for cross-talk among heterologous signal transduction pathways is demonstrated. Adipose triacylglycerols (TAGs) 2The abbreviations used are: TAG, triacylglycerol; CαS and CβS, catalytic α and β subunit, respectively; Bt2cAMP, dibutyryl cyclic AMP; DTT, dithiothreitol; HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PKA, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase; RIS, regulatory I subunit; RIαS and RIβS, regulatory Iα and Iβ subunit, respectively; RIIS, regulatory II subunit; RIIαS and RIIβS, regulatory IIα and IIβ subunit, respectively; 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-2-O-methyladenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate; UPGMA, unweighted pair group method using arithmetic averages; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. represent the largest pool of any organic molecule in the majority of adult mammals, even in nonobese animals. In rodents, for example, TAGs comprise 10% of body weight (1Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In humans, nonobese adults have nearly 15 kg of adipose tissue mass, with a mean TAG half-life of 6 months or more (2Strawford A. Antelo F. Christiansen M. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: E577-E588Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, TAGs are contained in various adipose pools, and each possesses different rates of synthesis and breakdown (1Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, half-life for TAGs in the epididymal fat pad of adult rats is 15 days (1Turner S.M. Murphy E.J. Neese R.A. Antelo F. Thomas T. Agarwal A. Go C. Hellerstein M.K. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: E790-E803Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These figures are indicative of a highly controlled and efficient regulatory mechanism to maintain in each adipose pool the tissue mass constant and resynthesis of the TAG amount degraded daily. Feeding status and relax versus stress conditions comprise the main external stimuli that control TAG synthesis and degradation via the two leading hormones that integrate the lipogenic or lipolytic response: insulin and adrenaline, respectively. Therefore, a competent cross-talk between adrenaline and insulin signaling pathways is required to reverse metabolic fluxes from lipolysis to lipogenesis and vice versa in adipose cells. Adrenaline elevates the cAMP pool to activate the dormant cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (3Taylor S.S. Yang J. Wu J. Haste N.M. Radzio-Andzelm E. Anand G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1697: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), which in turn phosphorylates the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin to increase lipolysis (4Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Hlavin E.M. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. IUMBMB Life. 2004; 56: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Additionally, acute insulin treatment stimulates a cAMP phosphodiesterase in an ATP-dependent fashion, promoting cAMP hydrolysis, lowering PKA activity, and decreasing PKA-dependent HSL phosphorylation and activation and lipolysis (5Holm C. Langin D. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Details of such complex interplay between cAMP and acute insulin administration have been documented in adipocytes and include stimulation of protein kinase B phosphorylation by insulin, which was inhibited by Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) agonist 8-(4chlorophenylthio)-2-O-methyladenosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP) (6Zmuda-Trzebiatowska E. Manganiello V. Degerman E. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 81-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Another mechanism for cross-talk between cAMP and chronic insulin administration has been reported (7Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J. Taylor S.S. Olefsky J.M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 2005; 437: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); chronic hyperinsulinemia resulted in enhanced cAMP production through β-adrenergic receptor activation in adipocytes (8Hupfeld C.J. Dalle S. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, this increase in the cAMP pool should raise lipolysis, but a well known action of insulin is to increase lipogenesis. Such a paradox was explained by demonstrating that continuous high insulin levels impair close apposition of β-adrenergic receptors and PKA; thus, chronic hyperinsulinemia disrupted the signaling pathway between β-adrenergic receptors and PKA (7Zhang J. Hupfeld C.J. Taylor S.S. Olefsky J.M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 2005; 437: 569-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This paper deals with the identification of a novel cross-talk between adrenaline and insulin signaling pathways in isolated adipocytes. Three experimental evidences were considered: (a) insulin stimulates a plasma membrane NADPH oxidase system present in adipocytes and transiently generates H2O2 (9Mukherjee S.P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1980; 29: 1239-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 10Krieger-Brauer H.I. Kather H. J. Clin.

Marti L. Carpéné C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 466: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar); and (c) H2O2 decreased PKA activity in fibroblasts (14Raynaud F. Evain-Brion D. Gerbaud P. Marciano D. Gorin I. Liapi C. Anderson W.B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 623-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and inhibited PKA activation by dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Bt2cAMP)-activated PKA in isolated adipocytes (15Gaudiot N. Ribiàre C. Jaubert A.M. Giudicelli Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1603-C1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we reasoned that insulin-generated H2O2 might regulate cAMP-dependent PKA activation in adipose cells. There are two major isoforms of cAMP-dependent PKA holoenzymes, type I and type II, both of which exist as tetramers integrated by two catalytic and two regulatory subunits. The regulatory subunit present in PKA holoenzyme, either RI (α or β subtype) or RII (α or β subtype), defines the enzyme as type I or type II, respectively. Information on cAMP-dependent protein kinase is abundant, and a summary of the impressive amount of data recorded for this enzyme can be found in a recent review (16Taylor S.S. Kim C. Vigil D. Haste N.M. Yang J. Wu J. Anand G.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1754: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and in the references cited therein. Oxidative stress can lead to the formation of a large number of protein disulfides (17Cumming R.C. Andon N.L. Haynes P.A. Park M. Fischer W.H. Schubert D. J. Biol.

Jakob U. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2003; 5: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been recently demonstrated in isolated rat ventricular myocytes that type I PKA is redox-active, forming an interprotein disulfide bond between two cysteines that align antiparallel to each other on different type I regulatory subunits (RIS) in response to cellular H2O2 (21Brennan J.P. Bardswell S.C. Burgoyne J.R. Fuller W. Schröder E. Wait R. Begum S. Kentish J.C. Eaton P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21827-21836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). This oxidative disulfide formation causes subcellular kinase translocation and activation, which phosphorylate their substrate proteins independently of β-adrenergic stimulation and cAMP elevations (21Brennan J.P.

On other hand, type II PKA holoenzyme, the major isoform present in adipocytes (22Chaudhry A. Zhang C. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C205-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also possess reactive cysteines that can form disulfide bonds between catalytic α subunits (CαS) and regulatory IIα subunits (RIIαS).

The main purpose of our work was to understand the molecular mechanism by which micromolar concentrations of H2O2 might inhibit type II PKA activation by cAMP and to explore the role of disulfide bond formation in this regulation. To undertake this investigation, three type II PKA holoenzymes were used: (a) a cell-free preparation from rat adipocytes containing PKA holoenzyme with Cα and RIIβ subunits (22Chaudhry A. Zhang C. Granneman J.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: C205-C212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (b) a commercial lyophilized enzyme from bovine heart mainly integrated by CαS and RIIαS (27Showers M.O.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5754-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). All three holoenzymes were similarly sensitive to micromolar concentrations of H2O2 in such a way that their cAMP-dependent activation was impaired. As a physiologic consequence of this inhibition in adipose cells, HSL was not translocated from cytosol to fat storage droplets, and lipolysis was slowed. Inactivation by H2O2 was reversed with thiol reagents, and PKA holoenzyme was activated again with cAMP. By use of a fully active H2O2-insensitive C199A catalytic subunit (26Humphries K.M. Deal M.S. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2750-2758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and supported by phylogenetic analysis of protein kinases, the highlighted Cys residues in PKA holoenzyme that are oxidized by H2O2, preventing cAMP physiologic activation, were identified. Reagents—Kemptide (phosphate acceptor peptide; Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly), Bt2cAMP, HEPES, MES, MOPS, dithiothreitol (DTT), GSH, cAMP, GTPγS, insulin, Epac agonist (8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP), PKA inhibitor H89, thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, collagenase type II, catalase, crude lyophilized PKA from bovine heart, and lyophilized PKA catalytic subunit from bovine heart were obtained from Sigma. Protease inhibitor cocktail and auranofin were obtained from MP (Fountain Parkway, Solon, OH). The Amplex Red kit was obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). H2O2 was obtained from Merck. Phosphocellulose filter paper P-81 and GF/C filters were purchased from Whatman, Inc. (Florham Park, NJ), whereas Sephadex G-50 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences, [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and part was a generous gift from M. Tuena de Gómez-Puyou at Institute of Cellular Physiology, National Autonomous University of Mexico with specific activity of 1.5 × 105 cpm/nmol [3H]cAMP was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and synthetic peptide GPRLELRPRPQQAPRS was prepared by Biosynthesis, Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Rabbit antiserum was prepared by C. Agundis and M. A. Pereira from the Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico. The antiserum was raised against the synthetic peptide just mentioned, derived from rat HSL (amino acid sequence 326–341) (31Holm C. Kirchgessner T.G. Svenson K.L. Lusis A.J. Belfrage P. Schotz M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9879Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and bound to fibrinogen. Specificity of the antibody was evaluated by an ELISA inhibition assay and by direct ELISA with the peptide alone (32Zentella de Piña M. Vázquez-Meza H. Agundis C. Pereyra M.A. Pardo J.P. Villalobos-Molina R. Piña E. Auton. Autacoid. Pharmacol. 2007; 27: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Purified murine PKA type II proteins (wild type catalytic α subunit, its C199A mutant, and regulatory RIIα subunits) were prepared in the laboratory of Dr. Susan S. Taylor (University of California, San Diego) (29Slice L.W. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20940-20946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Burns L.L. Canaves J.M. Pennypacker J.K. Blumenthal D.K. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5754-5763Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and they were a generous gift from her. Animals—Male Wistar rats weighing 200–240 g fed ad libitum with a commercial diet (Purina, México) and free access to water were used. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Federal Regulations for Animal Care and Use (NOM-062-ZOO-1999, Ministry of Agriculture, Mexico) and were approved by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, National Autonomous University of Mexico. Adipocyte Isolation and Measurement of Lipolysis—Animals were fasted for 16 h and decapitated. Subsequently, epididymal fat pads from two rats were immediately removed to isolate adipocytes following recommendations to obtain cells with low cAMP basal levels (33Honnor R.C. Dhillon G.R. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15122-15129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, Ringer-Krebs buffer was enriched with 25 mm HEPES, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 2 mm glucose, 200 nm adenosine, and bovine serum albumin (bovine serum albumin fraction V, fatty acid-free) either at 1 or 4%, as detailed later; pH was adjusted at 7.4. One g of minced fat pads from two rats was digested in 10 ml of collagenase (1 mg/ml) for 30 min, with vigorous shaking, in the Ringer-Krebs-enriched buffer supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were filtered through nylon cloth and washed three times by centrifugation (1 min each) at 220 × g. Wet packed adipocytes were weighed to report glycerol release by wet weight as an index of lipolysis, which was assayed using 100 μl of packed adipocytes, incubated during 30 min at 37 °C in a total volume of 1 ml of 4% bovine serum albumin in the Ringer-Krebs-enriched buffer in which Bt2cAMP, H2O2, catalase, insulin, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP, or H89 were dissolved appropriately to reach the final concentrations indicated in the figures. Adipocytes were dispersed during incubation by shaking at 160 cycles/min. Lipolysis was stopped by transferring tubes from 37 °C to an ice bath for 5 min. Tubes were immediately centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. A 300-μl aliquot from the solution lying below the fat cake was used to measure glycerol (34Warnick G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 101-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). NADPH-dependent H2O2 Generation System Activity—The procedure described to measure NADPH oxidase system activity in human adipocytes was followed (35Krieger-Brauer H.I. Medda P.K. Kather H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10135-10143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In brief, 100 μl of packed rat adipocytes obtained as described previously were suspended in 900 μl of an ice-cold lysing medium containing 20 mm MES pH 8.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, and 100 μl of mixture protease inhibitor. Cells were lysed after vigorous mixing for 5 min with the aid of a vortex. Lysed cells were spun at 1,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, supernatant was discarded, and the plasma membrane-containing precipitate was suspended in the activation buffer containing 30 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm NaHCO3. Centrifugation was repeated under identical conditions, supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was suspended in the activation buffer supplemented or not with MnCl2, GTPγS, cAMP, or insulin, as detailed in the figure legends. The NADPH oxidase system present in plasma membranes was activated by incubation at 25 °C during 25 min. Then, samples were centrifuged under the same conditions, and the precipitate was suspended and washed twice in catalysis buffer containing 30 mm MES, pH 5.8, 120 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm NaN3, and 10 mm FAD. Samples were spun and suspended in the same buffer, and the catalytic reaction was started with 250 μm NADPH and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped, transferring tubes from 37 °C to an ice bath for 5 min to measure H2O2 (36Mueller S. Weber A. Fritz R. Mütze S. Rost D. Walczak H. Völkl A. Stremmel W. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A 5-μl aliquot from mix reaction was used with 45 μl of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 50 μl of Amplex Red solution (commercial kit); samples were maintained during 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and absorbance was measured at 560 nm. Amplex Red reagent reacts with H2O2 in a 1:1 stoichiometry to produce resorfurin, the red fluorescent oxidation product that has an extinction coefficient of 54,000 cm-1 m-1, at 560 nm (36Mueller S. Weber A. Fritz R. Mütze S. Rost D. Walczak H. Völkl A. Stremmel W. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Assay of PKA Activity—Once rat adipocytes were prepared as described, a cell-free preparation suitable for assaying PKA enzyme activity was obtained (15Gaudiot N. Ribiàre C. Jaubert A.M. Giudicelli Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C1603-C1610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In short, 100 μl of isolated adipocytes was mixed with 900 μl of Ringer-Krebs buffer supplemented with 5 mm glucose and 2% bovine serum albumin and incubated during 1 h at 37 °C. Then the mixture was centrifuged at 2,400 × g during 5 min. The supernatant was eliminated, and the sediment containing adipocytes was disrupted in 350 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.33 m sucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, and protease inhibitors), and after vigorous shaking the sample was centrifuged at 2,400 × g for 4 min to obtain a floating fat cake, an intermediate layer, and the sediment. The intermediate layer was the source for measuring PKA activity in adipocytes. To measure PKA catalytic activity, aliquots of this cytosolic extract, either passed or not through Sephadex columns (see below), were mixed with 30 μl of 50 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7.0, containing 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, and [γ32-P]ATP (specific activity of 0.5 × 106 cpm/μmol) final concentration in incubation mixture. To analyze the effect of H2O2 on cAMP-mediated PKA activation, hydrogen peroxide was added to the enzyme either before, simultaneously with, or after the cyclic nucleotide. The catalytic reaction was started with 80 μm Kemptide in a total volume of 60 μl. At the end of the incubation period, 25 μl of reaction mixture was placed on a piece (1.5 × 1.5 cm) of Whatman P-81 filter paper, washed three times with 5 ml of 5% phosphoric acid, and placed in a vial with scintillation liquid to measure radioactivity. Gel Filtration to Separate Small Molecules from PKA—A 100-μl PKA aliquot from adipocyte lysates was preincubated with H2O2, and their respective controls were preincubated without H2O2. Then they were carefully loaded into an insulin syringe containing 700 μl of previously equilibrated Sephadex G-50 and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min at 4 °C (37Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The effluent containing the macromolecules separated from the small molecules was collected in 1.5 ml of Eppendorf tubes and utilized to assay PKA enzymatic activity as described above. In some experiments as detailed in the figure legends, the enzymatic reaction was measured in the presence of GSH or DTT. Translocation of HSL from Cytosol to Fat Storage Droplets—To define the HSL subcellular mobilization, both the floating fat cake containing fat storage droplets and the intermediate layer of adipocyte lysates obtained as described under “Assay of PKA Activity” were mixed and incubated in buffer with either 1 mm cAMP or 1 μm H2O2. Western blot analysis was conducted in the former two fractions (38Clifford G.M. Londos C. Kreamer F.B. Vernon R.G. Vaman S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5011-5015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Proteins resolved in SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and exposed to rabbit anti-HSL antiserum. Visualization was performed with a luminol kit (Super Signal West Pico kit; Pierce), and band quantitation was effected by densitometry using a Fotodyne apparatus (Fotodyne, Inc., Hartland, WI). Assay of Thioredoxin Reductase Activity—Two type of assays were conducted with thioredoxin reductase activity: one to revert the formation of an interprotein S–S bond and the other to verify its functional presence in adipocytes by measuring the enzyme's catalytic activity. An aliquot of lysated intermediate layer adipocytes was mixed in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, supplemented with 0.1 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid), and 310 μm NADPH. The difference of 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) oxidation in the presence and absence of auranofin, a specific inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase enzyme (39Rigobello M.P. Folda A. Baldoin M.C. Scutari G. Bindoli A. Free Radic. Res. 2005; 39: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), was registered as the enzyme activity value. To hinder formation of an S–S bond by the thioredoxin reductase system, this was added to the incubation mixture employed to measure PKA enzymatic activity. Competition Binding Experiments between cAMP and H2O2—The adipocyte extract intermediate layer was used as a PKA source for competition binding experiments (36Mueller S. Weber A. Fritz R. Mütze S. Rost D. Walczak H. Völkl A. Stremmel W. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 483-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Two hundred μg of protein were incubated for 15 min with 14 different concentrations of H2O2 (3 × 10-10 to 3 × 10-3 m), and then 0.4 nm [3H]cAMP (59 Ci/mmol) was added, and incubation continued for 1 h at 25 °C as described (40Dwivedi Y. Rizavi H.S. Pandey G.N. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 301: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the reaction mixture was filtered through Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel cell harvester (Biomedical Research and Development Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD); liquid scintillation was added, and the sample was counted in a liquid scintillation spectrometer at 60% efficiency (LS 6000; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). Data were analyzed by nonlinear regression with the EBDA-ligand program (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). Acid Gels and Western Blot Analysis—SDS-polyacrylamide gels at pH 2.4 were prepared as described by Dame and Scarborough (41Dame J.B. Scarborough G.A. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2931-2937Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), using 10 and 5% acrylamide for resolving and staking gels, respectively. A 60-μl aliquot of the adipocyte extract free of cells and lipids was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of cAMP and H2O2 for the times indicated in the figure legend. At the end of the incubation time, samples were boiled for 5 min and then loaded onto the gel (30 μg/lane). Electrophoresis was run at room temperature (20–22 °C) during 4 h at 75 mA. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using polyclonal antibodies against PKA catalytic α subunit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After the membrane was thoroughly washed, it was incubated with appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 4 °C (Jackson, CA). Protein bands were visualized by using a luminol/enhancer system (SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit; Pierce). A detailed description of the above mentioned procedure is given in Ref. 32Zentella de Piña M. Vázquez-Meza H. Agundis C. Pereyra M.A. Pardo J.P. Villalobos-Molina R. Piña E. Auton. Autacoid.

Phylogenetic Analysis—The search for protein kinase sequences was performed at the National Center for Biotechnology Information World Wide Web site (43Benson D.F. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J.

https://openalex.org/W1991515156,"We previously reported a cytosolic pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40) from Toxoplasma gondii (TgPyKI) that differs from most eukaryotic pyruvate kinases in being regulated by glucose 6-phosphate rather than fructose 1,6-diphosphate. Another putative pyruvate kinase (TgPyKII) was identified from parasite genome, which exhibits 32% amino acid sequence identity to TgPyKI and retains pyruvate kinase signature motifs and amino acids essential for substrate binding and catalysis. Whereas TgPyKI is most closely related to plant/algal enzymes, phylogenetic analysis suggests a proteobacterial origin for TgPyKII. Enzymatic characterization of recombinant TgPyKII shows a high pH optimum at 8.5, and a preference for GDP as a phosphate recipient. Catalytic activity is independent of K+, and no allosteric or regulatory effects were observed in the presence of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, fructose 2,6-diphosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, ribose 5-phosphate, AMP, or ATP. Unlike TgPyKI, native TgPyKII activity was exclusively associated with the membranous fraction of a T. gondii tachyzoite lysate. TgPyKII possesses a long N-terminal extension containing five putative start codons before the conserved region and localizes to both apicoplast and mitochondrion by immunofluorescence assay using native antibody and fluorescent protein fusion to the N-terminal extension. Further deletional and site-directed mutagenesis suggests that a translation product from 1st Met is responsible for the localization to the apicoplast, whereas one from 3rd Met is for the mitochondrion. This is the first study of a potential mitochondrial pyruvate kinase in any system.

Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite of warm-blooded animals, including humans (1Dubey J.P. Kreier J. P Parasitic Protozoa. Academic Press, San Diego1993: 5-56Google Scholar). Although normally asymptomatic, toxoplasmosis is a significant problem in pregnant women infected early during gestation, immunocompromised individuals, and livestock. This parasite is a member of the phylum Apicomplexa, which includes many other parasites such as Plasmodium species responsible for malaria. Glucose is thought to be the main source of energy for the rapidly multiplying forms of both Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, which use the Embden-Meyerhof pathway for glycolytic phosphorylation (2Fulton J.D. Spooner D.F. Exp. Parasitol. 1960; 9: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the essentially irreversible transphosphorylation from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 4The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ACP, acyl carrier protein; TgPyK, T. gondii pyruvate kinase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; SA, predicted signal anchor; SP signal peptide; pTP, predicted plastid transit peptide; mTP, predicted mitochondrion targeting peptide; aa, amino acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; HFF, human foreskin fibroblast; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; RFP, red fluorescent protein. 4The abbreviations used are: PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate; ACP, acyl carrier protein; TgPyK, T. gondii pyruvate kinase; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; SA, predicted signal anchor; SP signal peptide; pTP, predicted plastid transit peptide; mTP, predicted mitochondrion targeting peptide; aa, amino acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ab, antibody; HA, hemagglutinin; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; HFF, human foreskin fibroblast; IFA, immunofluorescence assay; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; RFP, red fluorescent protein. to ADP-producing pyruvate (3Boyer P.D. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrback K. The Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1962: 95-113Google Scholar). In most mammals and bacteria, pyruvate kinase is allosterically regulated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate (4Valentini G. Chiarelli L. Fortin R. Speranza M.L. Galizzi A. Mattevi A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18145-18152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) and thus plays a regulatory role in glycolysis. The product pyruvate feeds into many metabolic pathways, placing pyruvate kinase at a crucial metabolic intersection. Many organisms express multiple pyruvate kinase isozymes with different kinetic properties. For example, Escherichia coli bears two isozymes, type I and II, both of which are homotropically activated by the substrate PEP. The type I isozyme is also activated heterotropically by fructose 1,6-diphosphate and is inhibited by ATP (5Waygood E.B. Sanwal B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 265-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the type II isozyme is activated by AMP and monophosphorylated sugars (6Waygood E.B. Rayman M.K. Sanwal B.D. Can. J. Biochem. 1975; 53: 444-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Pyruvate kinases are expressed in the cytosol in most organisms. Plants and algae have additional isozymes in chloroplasts with markedly different physical and kinetic/regulatory characteristics (7Plaxton W.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 185-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). We have previously described the kinetic and regulatory properties of the cytosolic T. gondii pyruvate kinase (TgPyKI). Unlike T. gondii hexokinase (8Saito T. Maeda T. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. Nozaki T. Asai T. Int. J.

Parasitol. 1992; 54: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) that lack allosteric regulation, TgPyKI is allosterically regulated by glucose 6-phosphate (10Denton H. Roberts C.W.

We recently identified a second, highly diverged isozyme in T. gondii EST and genome data bases (12Bahl A. Brunk B. Crabtree J. Fraunholz M.J. Gajria B. Grant G.R. Ginsburg H. Gupta D. Kissinger J.C.

Ajioka, Cambridge University, UK) yielded a product with the expected size of 371 bp, which was used as a probe for cDNA library screening (8Saito T. Maeda T. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. Nozaki T. Asai T. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Positive clones were sequenced on both strands using a Genetic Analyzer model 310 and 3700 (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). The composite cDNA sequence was used for BLAST query against ToxoDB (18Kissinger J.C. Gajria B. Li L. Paulsen I.T. Roos D.S.

To confirm the 5′ end of the TgPyKII cDNA, total RNA was extracted from RH strain of T. gondii tachyzoites (RNAqueous, Ambion, TX), and cDNA was amplified using GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed using a gene-specific primer 5′-CACGTAGACAGAGGTGACGCTTCGGGG-3′. The complete cDNA sequence was analyzed by VectorNTI software (Infor-Max, Bethesda). The protein domains, families, and functional sites were analyzed using PROSITE (19Hulo N. Bairoch A. Bulliard V.

Expression and Purification of Recombinant TgPyKII—An open reading frame predicted to encode the conserved region (from amino acid 293 to 988) of TgPyKII was amplified using primers 5′-TACGGATCCCTCTCTGCTGCGTCGCCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGGGATCCCTATCGCCCTGACTCGAGAGT-3′ (antisense), and cloned into the BamHI site of vector pGEX-6p-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Expression of the glutathione S-transferase-TgPyKII-(293-988) fusion protein in E. coli BL21 was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-thiogalactoside for 2.5 h, and purification of recombinant TgPyKII was carried out by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), followed by treatment with PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was applied to a DEAE-Toyo Pearl 650s column (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EDTA. Peak fractions eluted with a linear 0-500 mm gradient of KCl were pooled, concentrated, assayed for purity and concentration, and stored in 30% glycerol (w/v) at -80 °C. The protein concentration was determined by the dye-binding procedure described by Bradford (32Kahn A. Marie J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The purity of recombinant pyruvate kinase was analyzed by electrophoresis on 5-10% acrylamide gel. The protein was detected by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Enzyme Assays—Pyruvate kinase activity was determined by lactate dehydrogenase-coupled spectrophotometric assay (32Kahn A. Marie J. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas monitoring oxidation of NADH due to pyruvate reduction at 340 nm was by using a UV-1600 spectrophotometer equipped with a TCC-240A temperature-controlled cell (Shimazu Co, Kyoto, Japan). 1-ml standard reaction mixture for assaying TgPyKII activity contained 1 mm PEP, 0.5 mm GDP, 25.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm NADH, 20 units of rabbit muscle lactate dehydrogenase type II (Sigma), 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.5, and 10-20 ng of the test enzyme. For substrate specificity studies, MgCl2 was added in 25 mm excess of NDP to ensure formation of the MgNDP2- complex. All reactions were initiated by the addition of the substrate NDP. For determining optimal pH of recombinant TgPyKII, MES, Tris-Cl, or CHES/NaOH buffers were used to generate a pH range from 6.0 to 10.0. Activities of TgPyKI and succinate dehydrogenase were assayed as described previously (10Denton H. Roberts C.W. Alexander J. Thong K.W. Coombs G.H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1996; 137: 103-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Maeda T. Saito T. Oguchi Y. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. Asai T. Parasitol. Res. 2003; 89: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All assays were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C. Reactions were monitored for 5 min, and the initial velocity was calculated from a tangent fitted to the reaction curve. Kinetic data were calculated using a nonlinear curve fitting algorithm (SigmaPlot 2000 software; SPSS Inc., Chicago). Subcellular Fractionation of T. gondii Tachyzoites—1010 tachyzoites were washed twice and resuspended in TES homogenization buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.5) and disrupted by French press at 35 kg/cm2. After sedimentation of unbroken cells (∼10%) at 2250 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g to yield a cytosolic (supernatant) and membranous (pellet) fractions. The pellet was washed once, resuspended in 1% Triton X-100 in TES buffer, and mechanically homogenized using a polychlorotrifluoroethylene homogenizer. Native Antibody Production and Immunoblotting—Recombinant TgPyKII-(293-988) purified from E. coli was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits. Following three 50-μg injections at 2-week intervals, whole IgG was isolated from serum, and anti-TgPyKII IgG was affinity-purified using CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences), which couples recombinant TgPyKII-(293-988) as described previously (33Sibley L.D. Niesman I.R. Asai T. Takeuchi T. Exp. Parasitol. 1994; 79: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). To check the cross-reactivity of anti-TgPyKII to TgPyKI, 3 ng of recombinant TgPyKI (11Maeda T. Saito T. Oguchi Y. Nakazawa M. Takeuchi T. Asai T. Parasitol. Res. 2003; 89: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and recombinant TgPyKII were loaded on 8% gradient polyacrylamide gel, which was then transferred to a Nitrocellulose Hybond-C extra membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry blotting apparatus. The membrane was blocked for 20 min with 2% skimmed milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.2% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with anti-TgPyKII antibody (1:25 in blocking solution). Following washes in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with alkaline phosphatase goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:3000) (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h, following detection with a 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-nitro blue tetrazolium system (Roche Applied Science). The molecular sizes of protein bands were determined with reference to pre-stained SDS-gel electrophoresis standards (Bio-Rad). To detect endogenous TgPyKII expressed in T. gondii, 108 RH tachyzoites released from HFF monolayer were filtered through 3-μm pore-size Nuclepore polycarbonate filters (Whatman) and pelleted by centrifugation at 900 × g for 12 min. Parasites were lysed in PBS, containing NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 0.5 m dithiothreitol. After denaturation at 70 °C for 10 min, parasite lysates were loaded on bis-Tris, 4-12% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen), and protein gel electrophoresis was performed using NuPAGE system with MOPS/SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a Trans-Blot SemiDry apparatus (Bio-Rad), which was then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 3% fetal bovine serum in PBS. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with a rabbit anti-TgPyKII Ab (1:25 dilution) in blocking solution containing 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma). Following washes in PBS with 0.2% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 1 h with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) (1:2500 dilution) in blocking solution containing 0.2% Tween 20. Chemiluminescence reaction was performed using ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences), and blots were exposed on Kodak BioMax film. Plasmid Construction—N-terminal 357 amino acids of TgPyKII (unconserved region containing five possible start codons) from 1st Met were amplified from a T. gondii RH cDNA using primers (note that restriction enzyme site is underlined and start codon is boldface) 5′-CATCGCAGATCTATGGACGATGGTGGAGCAGAGT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGTCACACTAGTCGGTCCGATGGTTGC-3′ (antisense) and subcloned into BglII/AvrII sites of the T. gondii expression vector ptub or pminPTF-YFP-HA (16Nishi M. Cell-cycle Regulation of Organelle Biogenesis and Apicoplast Protein Trafficking in Toxoplasma gondii. University of Pennsylvania, 2006Google Scholar) 5M. Nishi, C. He, O. Harb, J. Murray, and D. Roos, manuscript in preparation. to produce ptub/pminTgPyKII1stM-(1-357)-YFP-HA. DNA fragments from each downstream four start codons were generated using ptub/pminTgPyKII1stM-(1-357)-YFP-HA as a template, the above antisense primer, and the following sense primers: 5′-CATCGCAGATCTATGAACTTTCCAACTTGT-3′ (from 2nd Met); 5′-CATCGCAGATCTATGGCGCCTCTCCGACCC-3′ (from 3rd Met); 5′-CATCGCAGATCTATGGATTTTCCACGGGTG-3′ (from 4th Met); or 5′-CATCGCAGATCTATGCTCTCTGCTGCGTCG-3′ (from 5th Met). Plasmids ptub/pminTgPyKII2ndM-(19-357)-YFP-HA, ptub/pminTgPyKII3rdM-(93-357)-YFP-HA, ptub/pminTgPyKII4th-M-(122-357)-YFP-HA, and ptub/pminTgPyKII5thM-(293-357)-YFP-HA were constructed using above described subcloning method. To introduce a point mutation, methionine to alanine, at 2nd or 3rd Met, site-directed mutagenesis was performed using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). The plasmid ptub/pminPyKII1stM-(1-357)-YFP-HA was used as a template in the PCR by utilizing the following sets of primers (mutated amino acids are lowercase): 5′-GCTAATGGTTTTGCCAGCgcGAACTTTCCAACTTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACAAGTTGGAAAGTTCgcGCTGGCAAAACCATTAGC-3′ to produce ptub/minPyKII[2ndM19A]-YFP-HA, and 5′-CTCCTTCTCTCCGCGgcGGCGCCTCTCCGACC-3′ and 5′-GGTCGGAGAGGCGCCgcCGCGGAGAGAAGGAG-3′ to produce ptub/minPyKII[3rdM93A]-YFP-HA. Parasite Transfection, Immunofluorescence Assay, and Fluorescent Microscopy—Parasite transfection was performed by electroporation as described previously (14Roos D.S. Donald R.G. Morrissette N.S. Moulton A.L. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Parasites were inoculated onto glass coverslips (22 mm in diameter) with a confluent monolayer of HFF cells and incubated in a humidified 37 °C incubator for 24 h. Following a wash with PBS, coverslips were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.0, for 5 min, permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, pH 7.0, for 10 min, and blocked for 30 min in a blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Fisher) and 5% fetal bovine serum in PBS, pH 7.0). For MitoTracker labeling, coverslips were incubated with 150 nm MitoTrackerRed CMXRos (Invitrogen) for 30 min and washed twice with Ed1 media before fixation. For immunofluorescence assay (IFA), coverslips were incubated with primary antibodies (anti-TgPyKII Ab at 1:25 dilution or anti-ACP Ab at a 1:2000 dilution in blocking solution) for 1 h. Coverslips were washed three times with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS, and primary antibodies were detected either with Alexa Fluor Marina Blue/361-conjugated (1:500 dilution) or 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (1:4000 dilution) (Invitrogen) in the blocking solution for 1 h. After two washes with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS and a wash with PBS, the coverslips were mounted on glass slides using Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech, AL). To find out the localization of endogenous TgPyKII, parasites stably expressing FNRL-YFP-HA were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos and subjected to IFA using anti-TgPyKII and Alexa Fluor Marina Blue/361-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen). For examination of deletional constructs, wild type RH parasites were transfected, labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos, and subjected to IFA with anti-ACP and Alexa Fluor Marina Blue/361-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies. Point mutational constructs were transfected either to wild type RH parasites that are subsequently labeled with anti-ACP and Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Invitrogen) or to parasites stably expressing ptubHSP60L-RFP. Stacked images were collected using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope equipped with a 100-watt Hg-vapor lamp with appropriate barrier/emission filters. Images were captured with a CoolSNAP Hi Res CCD camera (Photometrics, AZ) and DeltaVision softWoRx software (Applied Precision, WA). All images were subjected to three-dimensional rendering using DeltaVision softWoRx. Gene Organization, Functional Motifs, and Phylogenetic Analysis of TgPyKII—We cloned a second pyruvate kinase isozyme gene from T. gondii, TgPyKII, using EST data bases, cDNA library screening, and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. A BLAST search of the cDNA sequence in ToxoDB (18Kissinger J.C. Gajria B. Li L. Paulsen I.T. Roos D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 234-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) identified the gene model TgTigrScan_6611 in chromosome III, consisting of two exons (1092 and 1871 bp) and an intron (764 bp) that encodes 988 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 106,837 Da and a pI of 8.77. BLASTP search shows that TgPyKII is highly homologous to pyruvate kinases from α-proteobacteria with >40% identity and >50% similarity. Multiple sequence alignments with crystallized pyruvate kinases (35Muirhead H. Clayden D.A. Barford D. Lorimer C.G. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Schiltz E. Schmitt W.

Compared with the pyruvate kinase domain structure consisting of A1, A2, B, and C domains, three unique insertions in the middle of domain B, A2, and C (37Rigden D.J. Phillips S.E. Michels P.A. Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 291: 615-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), are present (Fig. 1). Both TgPyKI and TgPyKII contain a pyruvate kinase signature (PROSITE; PS00110) (Fig. 1, line) as well as consensus motifs for pyruvate kinase, including binding sites of ADP, PEP, and divalent cations (Fig. 1, a, p, d, respectively). TgPyKI possesses all the conserved monovalent cation-binding sites (Fig. 1, m). In contrast, in TgPyKII, two binding sites Thr113 and Glu117 in Felis catus pyruvate kinase are substituted by Leu412 and Lys416, respectively. These substitutions are a common feature of monovalent cation-independent pyruvate kinases (38Laughlin L.T. Reed G.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 348: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 39Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L.

Furthermore, the presence of Glu868 in TgPyKII, conserved among enzymes that are insensitive to the pyruvate kinase activator, fructose 1,6-diphosphate (39Jurica M.S. Mesecar A. Heath P.J. Shi W. Nowak T. Stoddard B.L. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 195-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), suggests that TgPyKII is not activated by fructose 1,6-diphosphate. TgPyKII has overall amino acid sequence identity of 32% to TgPyKI. Unlike TgPyKII, TgPyKI shows high homology to pyruvate kinases in other apicomplexan parasites and plants. Phylogenetic tree indicates that TgPyKI is closely related to plant cytosolic pyruvate kinases along with pyruvate kinases from apicomplexan parasites such as Cryptosporidium parvum (EAK88569), Plasmodium falciparum (CAG25081), and Theileria parva (529.m04777) (Fig. 2). In contrast, TgPyKII clusters with proteobacteria pyruvate kinases, along with two isozymes from apicomplexan parasites P. falciparum (AAG35560) and T. parva (529.m04771) (Fig. 2). These results suggest a different evolutionary origin of the two isozymes in T. gondii, a probable plant/algal origin of TgPyKI and a probably proteobacterial origin of TgPyKII. Enzymatic Activity of Recombinant and Native TgPyKII Proteins—Conserved region of TgPyKII (TgPyKII-(293-988)) was expressed in E. coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, which was removed by PreScission protease (Amersham Bioscien"
https://openalex.org/W1986104995,"The human suppressor of morphogenesis in genitalia-1 (hSMG-1) protein kinase plays dual roles in mRNA surveillance and genotoxic stress response pathways in human cells. Here, we report that small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of hSMG-1, but not ATM, ATR, hUpf1, or hUpf2, in human U2OS osteosarcoma cells markedly increases the magnitude and accelerates the rate of apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) stimulation. The increase in TNFalpha-mediated cell killing observed in hSMG-1-depleted cells is not related to the suppression of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or to the inhibition of TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation. Rather, we observed that loss of hSMG-1 accelerates the degradation of the long form of the FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP(L)), an inhibitor of death-inducing signaling complex-mediated caspase-8 activation, in TNFalpha-treated cells. These results suggest that hSMG-1 plays an important role in cell survival during TNFalpha-induced stress."

In this study, we showed that IRAK can be ubiquitinated through both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains upon IL-1 induction. Pellino 3b is the RING-like motif ubiquitin protein ligase that promotes the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination on IRAK. Pellino 3b-mediated Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination competed with Lys-48-linked IRAK polyubiquitination for the same ubiquitination site, Lys-134 of IRAK, thereby blocking IL-1-induced IRAK degradation. Importantly, the negative impact of Pellino 3b on IL-1-induced IRAK degradation correlated with the inhibitory effect of Pellino 3b on the IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent pathway, suggesting that a positive role of IRAK degradation in IL-1 induced TAK1 activation.

Although the membrane-associated modified IRAK is ubiquitinated and degraded, complex III (TRAF6-TAK1-TAB2-TAB3) is then dissociated from complex II and translocated from the membrane to the cytosol, where TAK1 is activated, followed by the activation of IκB kinase (IKK) and NFκB (7Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Chen and co-workers (14Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A.

Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1623) Google Scholar) showed that protein ubiquitination plays an important role in TRAF6-mediated TAK1 and IKK activation. The ubiquitin pathway generally involves three types of enzymes, ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1 or Uba), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2 or Ubc), and ubiquitin protein ligase (E3 or Ubr) (16Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). The E3 ubiquitin protein ligases play a key role in recognition and selection of proteins targeted for ubiquitination. Many RING finger proteins have been shown to act as E3s, either by themselves or as part of a multisubunit E3 protein complex (17Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). TRAF6, a RING domain protein, has been shown to function as a ubiquitin protein ligase E3, and itself might be the target of ubiquitination, which leads to the activation of TAK1. Polyubiquitination of a target protein with the ubiquitin linked through Lys-48 is recognized by proteasome and ultimately degraded. However, polyubiquitination chains linked through Lys-63 of ubiquitin do not target the substrate for proteasome-mediated degradation, mediating protein-protein interaction and cell signaling instead. It has been reported that TRAF6-mediated Lys-63 polyubiquitination on itself plays an essential role in the activation of IKK and NFκB (18Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Sci. STKE 272. 2005; : PE7Google Scholar). Recently genetic studies have provided further evidence for an essential role of TAK1 in IL-1 signaling. Two groups (19Sato S. Sanjo H. Takeda K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Yamamoto M. Kawai T. Matsumoto K.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2668-2681Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) independently reported that TAK1 deficiency results in defects in IL-1 signaling. Intriguingly, whereas IL-1-induced JNK activation was completely abolished, NFκB activation was only partially impaired in TAK1-deficient cells, implicating an additional NFκB activation mechanism for the IL-1 pathway. We recently identified two parallel IL-1-mediated NFκB activation pathways as follows: TAK1-dependent and MEKK3-dependent (Fig. 1) (21Yao J. Kim T. Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Xiao H. Lu Y. Wen Q. Gulen M.F. Sizemore N. DiDonato J. Sato S. Akira S. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6075-6089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The TAK1-dependent pathway causes IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKβ activation, leading to classical NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The TAK1-independent MEKK3-dependent pathway induces IKKγ phosphorylation and IKKα activation, resulting in NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation from NFκB but without IκBα degradation. These two pathways are regulated at the level of IRAK modification (21Yao J. Kim T. Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Xiao H. Lu Y. Wen Q. Gulen M.F. Sizemore N. DiDonato J. Sato S. Akira S. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6075-6089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Previous studies showed that IRAK is phosphorylated after it is recruited to the receptor, subsequently ubiquitinated, and eventually degraded upon IL-1 stimulation. A point mutation changing lysine 134 to arginine (K134R) in IRAK abolished IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and degradation. The IRAK ubiquitination mutant is no longer degraded upon IL-1 stimulation and loses the ability to mediate the TAK1-dependent NFκB activation, while retaining the MEKK3-dependent signaling (21Yao J. Kim T. Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Xiao H. Lu Y. Wen Q. Gulen M.F. Sizemore N. DiDonato J. Sato S. Akira S. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6075-6089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). At the moment, it is unknown which ubiquitin protein ligase E3(s) is responsible for the IL-1-induced ubiquitination of IRAK required for the activation of the TAK1-dependent NFκB activation pathway. Pellino proteins have recently been reported as novel RING E3 ubiquitin ligases and implicated in IRAK ubiquitination. There are four Pellino family members, Pellino 1, 2, 3a, and splicing variant Pellino 3b, which are highly conserved from Drosophila to human. Although Pellino 1 and 2 share 82% amino acid identity, Pellino 3 has 70 and 71% amino acid identity with Pellino 1 and 2, respectively (11Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol.

Although both Pellino 3a and 3b have a unique N terminus, containing 27 extra amino acids, Pellino 3b is missing an exon (exon 3, 24 amino acids) as compared with Pellino 3a. We and others have previously demonstrated that Pellino proteins form complexes with IRAK and TRAF6, implicating an important role of the Pellino proteins in IL-1 signaling. Although Pellino 1 and 2 have the ability to activate NFκB, Pellino 3a and 3b promote JNK activation but not NFκB. Recombinant forms of Pellinos are shown in an in vitro ubiquitination assay to be E3 ubiquitin ligases that catalyze Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination (27Butler M.P. Hanly J.A. Moynagh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29729-29737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, Ordureau et al. (28Ordureau A. Smith H. Windheim M. Peggie M. Carrick E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) recently reported that Pellino 1 protein can combine with UbcH3 to catalyze the formation of Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination in vitro, whereas Pellino 2 only induces the formation of Lys-63-poly(Ub)-IRAK1 in the cell culture model. If the Pellinos directly mediate IRAK polyubiquitination, then the critical questions are whether Pellinos mediate the formation of the polyubiquitin chain through Lys-63 or Lys-48 and what the function of Pellino mediated IRAK ubiquitination is. In this study, we showed that IRAK can be ubiquitinated through both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains upon IL-1 induction, suggesting the complex role of IRAK ubiquitination on IL-1 signaling. In the search of E3 ligases for IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination, we found that Pellino 3b is the E3 ligase that promotes the Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination on IRAK. Mutation analysis revealed that the RING-like motif in Pellino 3b is required for its E3 ligase activity. Pellino 3b-mediated Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination competed with Lys-48-linked IRAK polyubiquitination for the same ubiquitination site (Lys-134) on IRAK, thereby blocking IL-1-induced IRAK degradation. Importantly, the negative impact of Pellino 3b on IL-1-induced IRAK degradation correlated with the inhibitory effect of Pellino 3b on IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent pathway, suggesting a positive role of IRAK degradation in IL-1-induced TAK1 activation. In support of this, proteasome inhibitor MG132 inhibited IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent signaling. Taken together, we conclude that Pellino 3b acts as a negative regulator for IL-1 signaling by regulating IRAK degradation through its E3 ligase activity. Cell Lines and Reagents—C6 (HEK293/IL-1RI), I1A (HEK293/IRAK-deficient), and synoviocytes were grown on Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Oligonucleotides encoding either scrambled or Pellino 3 specific small hairpin RNAs were cloned into pSUPER to construct pSUPER-scrambled and pSUPER-pellino 3, respectively. 1 μg of pSUPER-scrambled or pSUPER-pellino 3 was transfected into C6 cells along with 0.1 μg of pBabo-puromycin by FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Two days after transfection, puromycin (1 μg/ml) containing Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was added to the cells to select puromycin-resistant clones. Following 10 days of puromycin selection, single clones were picked out and subjected to further analysis by anti-Pellino 3 blotting. cDNA encoding human Pellino 3b was cloned into pcDNA3.1 to create pcDNA3.1-FLAG-pellino 3b. pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1-FLAG-pellino 3b (1 μg) was transfected into C6 cells along with pBabo-puromycin (0.1 μg) by FuGENE 6. Following puromycin selection for 10 days, single clones were picked out, and clones expressing FLAG-pellino 3b were confirmed by anti-FLAG blotting. IRAK (H-273, sc-7883), IRAK-agarose (F-4, sc-5288 AC), TRAF6 (H-274, sc-7221), IKKα/β (H-470, sc-7607), IκBα (FL, sc-847), IKKγ (FL-419, sc-4330), JNK1 (FL, sc-571), ubiquitin (FL-76, sc-9133, and P4D1, sc-8017), HA probe (Y-11, sc-805), and actin (C-11, sc-1615) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-FLAGM2 antibodies (F7425 from rabbit; A2220 affinity gel from mouse), puromycin (P9620), and MG132 (C2211) were from Sigma. Phospho-IKKα (Ser-176)/β (Ser-180) (catalog number 2694), phospho-IKKγ (Ser-376) (catalog number 2689), phospho-stress-activated protein kinase/JNK (catalog number 9251), and phospho-IκBα (Ser 32)(catalog number 9241) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Polyclonal anti-Pellino 3 and anti-TAK1 antibodies from rabbit were made by Lilly. Recombinant interleukin-1β was from R & D Systems. Immunoprecipitation—Subconfluent C6 cells were stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-1β for various times as indicated. Following washing with cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm NaVO3, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× complete protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifuging at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and insoluble debris was discarded. For co-immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG affinity gel at 4 °C overnight, and FLAG beads were washed with 1 ml of lysis buffer five times before dissolving in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer. When examining the ubiquitination of IRAK or Pellino 3b, immunoprecipitation was carried out under denaturing condition. Briefly, cell lysates containing 1% SDS were incubated for 10 min at 100 °C to disrupt the protein complexes. Denatured protein lysates were placed on ice for 5 min and then diluted 10 times with lysis buffer shown above. The cell lysates containing 0.1% SDS were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of anti-FLAG affinity gel (A2220) or 30 μl of anti-IRAK-agarose (sc-5288 AC) at 4 °C overnight. Anti-FLAG and anti-IRAK beads were washed five times with lysis buffer containing 0.1% SDS and subsequently dissolved in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer. In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—His-tagged Pellino 1, Pellino 2, and Pellino 3b were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose from Qiagen according to the manufacturer's manual. The preparation of E1, Ubc13/Uev1A, Ubc5H, UbcH3, and ubiquitin proteins has been described previously (16Chen Z.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 758-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Recombinant IRAK, UbcH5, and UbcH3 were kindly provided by Dr. Philip Cohen (28Ordureau A. Smith H. Windheim M. Peggie M. Carrick E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The in vitro ubiquitination reaction was carried out in 1× reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl, 10% glycerol). 1 μg of Pellino protein was incubated with 100 nm E1, 250 nm or 1 μm of E2, and 5 μg of ubiquitin at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 μl of Laemmli buffer, and assembly of polyubiquitin chain was detected by anti-ubiquitin immunoblotting. Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates, immunoprecipitates, or in vitro ubiquitinated proteins were dissolved in Laemmli buffer and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). For immunoblotting, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk. Following incubation with specific primary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied. The positive immune reactive signal was detected by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). IL-1-induced IRAK Polyubiquitination Is Linked through Both Lys-48 and Lys-63—Upon IL-1 stimulation, IRAK is phosphorylated, polyubiquitinated, and eventually degraded (29Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chain has been exclusively related to protein degradation, Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chain has been emerged as a type of polyubiquitin that promotes protein-protein association (4Kanayama A. Seth R.B. Sun L. Ea C.K. Hong M. Shaito A. Chiu Y.H. Deng L. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 535-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To examine whether IL-1-induced polyubiquitination of IRAK is linked via Lys-63 or Lys-48, HA-tagged wild type and a series of mutants of ubiquitin were transfected into 293 cells. Cell lysates prepared from untreated or IL-1-treated transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-IRAK, followed by Western analysis with anti-HA to detect HA-tagged ubiquitin. Following IL-1 induction, although we detected polyubiquitinated IRAK in cells transfected with wild-type ubiquitin, the ubiquitin mutants Lys-63 and Lys-48 (30Ea C.K. Deng L. Xia Z.P. Pineda G. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 22: 245-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar) (all the lysines in ubiquitin are mutated to arginine except Lys-63 or Lys-48) were conjugated to IRAK as well. On the other hand, the ubiquitin mutants K63R and K48R (Lys-63 and Lys-48 are mutated to arginine) were also able to form a polyubiquitin chain on IRAK (Fig. 2). Taken together, these results suggest that IL-1 stimulation probably induces the assembly of both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on IRAK. Pellinos Mediate Both Lys-48 and Lys-63 Polyubiquitination in Vitro—Schauvliege et al. (26Schauvliege R. Janssens S. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) recently reported that overexpression of Pellino 1 and 2 (to a lesser degree Pellino 3a) leads to IRAK ubiquitination. To test whether Pellino proteins can indeed function as E3 ubiquitin ligase and directly mediate polyubiquitination, we purified recombinant Pellino proteins and E1/E2 enzymes from E. coli and carried out in vitro ubiquitination assay using ubiquitin as a substrate. Pellino 2 and 3b and to a much lesser extent Pellino 1 promoted the assembly of polyubiquitin chain when Ubc13/Uev1A was used as E2 (Fig. 3A), whereas Pellino 2 and 3b failed to promote polyubiquitination with UbcH5 as E2. To determine whether Pellinos mediate Lys-48 or Lys-63 polyubiquitination in combination with Ubc13/Uev1A, different ubiquitin mutants were used in the in vitro ubiquitination assay. These experiments showed that Pellino 2 and 3b can only form polyubiquitin chain with wild-type ubiquitin or ubiquitin mutants containing Lys-63, indicating that Pellino 3b- and Pellino 2-mediated polyubiquitin chain in combination with Ubc13/Uev1A is linked through Lys-63 (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, Ordureau et al. (28Ordureau A. Smith H. Windheim M. Peggie M. Carrick E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that phosphorylation mediated by IRAK can greatly increase the E3 ligase activity of Pellino 1 in vitro. Indeed, incubation of Pellino 1 with IRAK increased the ability of Pellino 1 in mediating Lys-63-type ubiquitination with UbcH13/Uev1A as E2 (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, in the presence of IRAK, all three Pellino proteins can combine with E2-conjugating enzyme UbcH5 or UbcH3 to catalyze polyubiquitination (Fig. 3D). Further analysis showed that Pellino proteins were able to mediate Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination with UbcH3 (Fig. 3E). Pellinos Induce Formation of Lys-63-linked IRAK Polyubiquitination in Vivo—We and others (Schauvliege et al. (26Schauvliege R. Janssens S. Beyaert R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 4697-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)) have observed that that overexpression of Pellinos leads to IRAK ubiquitination. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, co-expression of Pellinos with IRAK in 293 cells can lead to efficient IRAK ubiquitination. We then examined whether Pellinos mediate Lys-48 and/or Lys-63polyubiquitination on IRAK. Different ubiquitin mutants were co-transfected with Pellinos and IRAK into I1A cells (IRAK-deficient), followed by immunoprecipitation with IRAK and Western analysis with anti-HA to detect HA-tagged ubiquitin. We only detected IRAK polyubiquitination in cells co-transfected with Lys-63-containing ubiquitins (Fig. 4, C and D). The fact that a single mutation of Lys-63 in ubiquitin completely abrogated its ability to be assembled on IRAK by Pellinos strongly suggests that the Pellino-mediated IRAK polyubiquitination was linked through Lys-63, although IL-1 stimulation leads to both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination (Fig. 2). Taken together, although Pellinos were able to mediate either Lys-48- or Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination in vitro (depending on the specific E2s provided) (Fig. 3), all three Pellinos (Pellino 1/2/3b) mainly mediate Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination in cell culture model. Pellino 3b Is a RING-like E3 Ubiquitin Ligase—In addition to its strong E3 ubiquitin ligase activity with Ubc13/Uev1A as E2 in vitro, Pellino 3b also exhibited the strongest activity in self-ubiquitination upon its overexpression in 293 cells as compared with the other Pellino family members (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, overexpressed Pellino 3b inhibited IL-1-induced NFκB activity measured by luciferase assay, whereas overexpressed Pellino 1 and 2 increased NFκB activity (Fig. 5B) (11Jiang Z. Johnson H.J. Nie H. Qin J. Bird T.A. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10952-10956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), implicating different functions of these family members of Pellino. Because Pellino 3b displayed distinct function compared with Pellino 1 and 2, we decided to further investigate the E3 activity of Pellino 3b and its function in IL-1 signaling. Pellino proteins have a RING-like motif (CHC2CHC2) at the C terminus. To examine whether that this RING-like motif is responsible for the E3 activity of Pellino proteins, we generated a set of mutants of Pellino 3b either by deleting the RING-like motif (N) or mutating the individual conserved Cys (Cys to Ser) and His (His to Arg) in the RING-like motif. As shown in Fig. 5C, disruption or deletion of the RING motif impaired the ability of Pellino 3b to promote self-ubiquitination. Indeed, the RING-like motif is absolutely required for Pellino 3b to function as an E3 ligase in vitro (Fig. 5D). Mutations in the RING-like motif abolished the ability of Pellino 3b to ubiquitinate IRAK (Fig. 5E). Pellino 3b-mediated Lys-63-linked Polyubiquitination Competes with Lys-48-linked Polyubiquitination on Lys-134 of IRAK—The fact that a point mutation changing lysine 134 to arginine (K134R) in IRAK abolished IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and degradation suggests that Lys-134 is likely the ubiquitination site for the assembly of both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on IRAK in response to IL-1 stimulation (21Yao J. Kim T. Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Xiao H. Lu Y. Wen Q. Gulen M.F. Sizemore N. DiDonato J. Sato S. Akira S. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6075-6089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that Pellino 3b-mediated IRAK polyubiquitination was greatly reduced when Pellino 3b was co-transfected with the K134R IRAK mutant, suggesting that Pellino 3b mediates polyubiquitination mainly on Lys-134 of IRAK (Fig. 6, A and B). Pellino 3b-mediated residual ubiquitination on K134R mutant might be due to a compensatory ubiquitination site in this IRAK mutant upon overexpression of Pellino 3b. Because Pellino 3b mediates Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination, it is unlikely for Pellino 3b to be responsible for IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination and subsequent IRAK degradation. To examine the impact of Pellino 3b on IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and degradation, we used Pellino 3 siRNA to knock down the expression of Pellino 3b. Interestingly, we found that IL-1-induced IRAK degradation was accelerated in clones where Pellino 3b expression was knocked down (Fig. 6C), indicating an important role of Pellino 3b in regulating IL-1-induced IRAK degradation. These results suggest that Pellino 3b probably contributes to IL-1-induced Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination, which might compete with IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK polyubiquitination, because both types of ubiquitination take place on the same ubiquitination site in IRAK (Lys-134 of IRAK). Such competition is abolished in the absence of Pellino 3b, which then leads to increased IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked ubiquitination resulting in increased IRAK degradation. In support of this notion, knocking down Pellino 3b expression reduced IL-1-induced Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination, but greatly increased IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK polyubiquitination (Fig. 6D). In addition, overexpression of Pellino 3b promoted IL-1-induced Lys-63-linked IRAK ubiquitination but inhibited IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK polyubiquitination and degradation (Fig. 6, E and F). Because Pellino 2 also mediates Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination on IRAK, we tested the impact of Pellino 2 on IL-1-mediated IRAK degradation. Interestingly, overexpression of Pellino 2, a positive regulator for IL-1 signaling, did not inhibit IL-1-induced IRAK degradation (Fig. 6, G and H). Instead, overexpression of Pellino 2 enhanced IRAK degradation (Fig. 6, G and H). These results indicate that Pellino 3b and Pellino 2 probably play differential roles in multiple steps of IRAK polyubiquitination and IRAK-mediated signaling. Pellino 3b Negatively Regulates IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent Signaling Pathway—Pellino 1 and 2 have been implicated in IL-1 signaling and shown to have the ability to activate NFκB. Windheim et al. (31Windheim M. Stafford M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination plays a critical role in IKK activation. We recently found that IL-1-induced TAK1 modification and IκBα degradation were reduced in Pellino 2 knockdown cells, suggesting the importance of Pellino 2 in TAK1-dependent NFκB activation pathway (data not shown). However, overexpression of Pellino 3a and 3b promotes JNK activation but not NFκB activation. Interestingly, IL-1 stimulation up-regulated the expression of endogenous Pellino 3 and induced slowly migrating modified forms of Pellino 3, suggesting a role of Pellino 3 in IL-1 signaling (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, IL-1 stimulation induced the interaction between endogenous Pellino 3 with IRAK and TRAF6, whereas Pellino 3 constitutively interacted with TAK1 (Fig. 7B). We recently identified two parallel IL-1-mediated NFκB activation pathways, TAK1-dependent and MEKK3-dependent (Fig. 1). These two pathways are regulated at the level of IRAK modification. The K134R IRAK ubiquitination mutant is no longer degraded upon IL-1 stimulation and loses the ability to mediate the TAK1-dependent NFκB activation, while retaining the MEKK3-dependent signaling. Because Pellino 3b has significant impact on IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and degradation, we hypothesized that Pellino 3b may play a major role in regulating the TAK1-dependent signaling pathway. Interestingly, we observed that IL-1 induced hyperphosphorylation of TAK1 and TAB1 in 293 cells transfected with Pellino 3 siRNA, whereas overexpression of Pellino 3b inhibited IL-1-induced TAK1 and TAB1 phosphorylation, suggesting a negative role of Pellino 3b in IL-1-induced TAK1 activation (Fig. 8, A and B). The TAK1-dependent pathway causes IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKβ activation, leading to classical NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. Although IL-1-induced IKKα/β phosphorylation, IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, and NFκB DNA binding activity were increased in the Pellino 3 knockdown cells as compared with the control cells, these signaling events were significantly inhibited in cells with overexpression of Pellino 3b (Fig. 8, A–C). In addition to its role in NFκB activation, TAK1 has been shown to be required for IL-1-induced JNK activation. In agreement with its negative regulatory role in the TAK1-dependent pathway, IL-1-induced JNK activation was also increased in Pellino 3b knockdown cells and decreased in 293 cells stably transfected with Pellino 3b (Fig. 8, A and B). Mutations in the RING motif impaired the ability of Pellino 3b to inhibit IL-1-induced signaling (Fig. 8D). It is important to note that a previous study reported that overexpression of Pellino 3 can lead to constitutive JNK activation (25Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1500-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). When we transiently transfected Pellino 3b into the 293 cells, a low level of JNK activation was observed (data not shown). However, in 293 cells stably transfected with Pellino 3b, constitutive JNK activation was not observed (Fig. 8B). Instead, Pellino 3b inhibited IL-1-induced JNK activation. On the other hand, Pellino 3b failed to inhibit TNFα-induced IκBα phosphorylation, IκBα degradation, or JNK activation (Fig. 8E), indicating the specific role of Pellino 3b in regulating IL-1 signaling. To further test the effect of Pellino 3b on IL-1 signaling, IL-1-induced IL-8 production was examined in media from Pellino 3b knockdown cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in Fig. 8F, IL-1-induced IL-8 production was increased by about 5-fold in Pellino 3b knockdown cells. Taken together, these results indicate that Pellino 3b negatively regulates the IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent pathway. The K134R IRAK ubiquitination mutant is no longer degraded upon IL-1 stimulation and loses the ability to mediate the TAK1-dependent NFκB activation, suggesting that IL-1-induced ubiquitination and degradation of IRAK are required for the TAK1-dependent NFκB activation pathway. However, it is also possible that only the IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination is the necessary biochemical modification required for the activation of the TAK1-dependent pathway, and the IL-1-induced IRAK degradation is the consequence of activation. The fact that the negative regulatory impact of Pellino 3b on IL-1-induced IRAK degradation correlated with its inhibitory effect on IL-1-induced TAK1 activation suggests that IRAK degradation might be required for the activation of the TAK1-dependent pathway. In support of this, we found that the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked IL-1-induced TAK1 activation, suggesting that IL-1-induced IRAK degradation is likely a necessary step in the activation of the TAK1-dependent pathway (Fig. 8G). In this study, we report that Pellino 3b acts as a negative regulator for IL-1 signaling by regulating IRAK degradation through its E3 ligase activity. Our results showed that IRAK is ubiquitinated through both Lys-48- and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination upon IL-1 induction. We recently found that a point mutation changing lysine 134 to arginine (K134R) in IRAK abolished IL-1-induced IRAK ubiquitination and degradation. These results suggest that Lys-134 is the site for both Lys-48-linked and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains on IRAK. We now found that Pellino 3b, a RING-like motif E3 ligase, played a critical role in IL-1-induced Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination on IRAK. Pellino 3b-mediated Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination competed with Lys-48-linked IRAK polyubiquitination for the same ubiquitination site, Lys-134 of IRAK, leading to inhibition of IL-1-induced IRAK degradation. We recently identified two parallel IL-1-mediated NFκB activation pathways, TAK1-dependent and MEKK3-dependent (Fig. 1) (21Yao J. Kim T. Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Xiao H. Lu Y. Wen Q. Gulen M.F. Sizemore N. DiDonato J. Sato S. Akira S. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6075-6089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The TAK1-dependent pathway causes IKKα/β phosphorylation and IKKβ activation, leading to classical NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and degradation. The TAK1-independent MEKK3-dependent pathway induces IKKγ phosphorylation and IKKα activation, resulting in NFκB activation through IκBα phosphorylation and subsequent dissociation from NFκB but without IκBα degradation. These two pathways are regulated at the level of IRAK modification (21Yao J. Kim T. Qin J. Jiang Z. Qian Y. Xiao H. Lu Y. Wen Q. Gulen M.F. Sizemore N. DiDonato J. Sato S. Akira S. Su B. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 282: 6075-6089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that Pellino 3b efficiently inhibits IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent signaling events using siRNA or overexpression of Pellino 3b, including phosphorylation of TAK1/TAB1, phosphorylation of IKKα/β, and IκBα degradation (Fig. 8, A and B). The inhibition of Pellino 3b on the MEKK3-mediated pathway is probably less effective. Although TAK1-dependent signaling events (phosphorylation of TAK1/TAB1, phosphorylation of IKKα/β, and IκBα degradation) were severely abolished in cells with overexpression of Pellino 3b, significant levels of IL-1-induced phosphorylation of IκBα and NFκB DNA binding activity were still detected in the same cells, probably mediated by the MEKK3-dependent pathway (Fig. 8, B and C). The fact Pellino 3b exhibited inhibitory effect on both IL-1-induced IRAK degradation and TAK1-dependent NFκB activation suggests an important role of IRAK degradation in IL-1-induced TAK1 activation. Consistent with this finding, the K134R IRAK ubiquitination mutant deficient in IL-1-induced IRAK degradation lost the ability to mediate IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent NFκB activation. Yamin and Miller (29Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) previously reported that proteasome inhibitor blocked IL-1-induced IRAK degradation, resulting in accumulation of modified forms of IRAK. Consistent with Yamin and Miller (29Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), we found that MG132 treatment resulted in accumulation of modified forms of IRAK (Fig. 8G). Furthermore, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 blocked IL-1-induced TAK1-dependent signaling, suggesting that IL-1-induced IRAK degradation might indeed be a necessary step in the activation of the TAK1-dependent pathway. Intriguingly, Windheim et al. (31Windheim M. Stafford M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) was unable to show the effectiveness of MG132 on IRAK degradation. Because of the complex modification pattern of IRAK, an extensive time course might be helpful to clearly observe IRAK degradation. The ubiquitinated proteins associated with IRAK might mask the effectiveness of MG132 treatment when IRAK is immunoprecipitated, followed by Western analysis with ubiquitin antibody. Such caution also needs to be taken for the analysis of IRAK ubiquitination mutants including K134R. Although it was speculated that IRAK degradation may be one of the mechanisms to shut down IL-1 signaling to control inflammatory responses, as presented above, our recent studies suggest that IRAK degradation is also required for activation of the TAK1-dependent pathway. One possible role for IL-1-induced IRAK degradation in the activation of TAK1 is to release the TAK1 complex from the membrane-associated IRAK-TRAF6-TAK1-TABs complex. We have previously shown that TAK1-TABs are preassociated as a complex on the membrane before IL-1 stimulation (7Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Upon IL-1 stimulation, the modified IRAK-TRAF6 complex dissociates from the receptor complex (complex I) and forms complex II with the preassociated TAK1-TABs on the membrane. The membrane-bound modified IRAK is eventually ubiquitinated and degraded, which is accompanied by the release of the TAK1 complex (TRAF6-TAK1-TABs) from the membrane to the cytosol, where TAK1 is activated (7Jiang Z. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Qian Y. Matsumoto K. Li X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7158-7167Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination and subsequent degradation might play a critical role in the release of TAK1 complex from the membrane to the cytosol. It is interesting that although the interaction of Pellino 3b with IRAK and TRAF6 is IL-1-dependent, Pellino 3b constitutively interacts with TAK1. It is possible that Pellino 3b is present in the membrane-associated TAK1 complex before IL-1 stimulation. IL-1 stimulation leads to the formation of IRAK-TRAF6-Pellino 3b-TAK1-TABs complex on the membrane, where Pellino 3b mediates Lys-63-linked IRAK polyubiquitination. Pellino 3b-mediated Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination may then compete with IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination, thereby blocking degradation and subsequent release of the TAK1 complex. It is intriguing that Windheim et al. (31Windheim M. Stafford M. Peggie M. Cohen P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1783-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) reported that IL-1 triggers predominant formation of Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK and is less abundant for Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination of IRAK. Because the degree of polyubiquitination chains formed on IRAK is proportional to the expression levels of HA-ubiquitin, the poor expression of K63R ubiquitin mutant might affect the interpretation of the results. In our study, we have now used not only K63R and K48R but also Lys-63-only and Lys-48-only ubiquitin mutants to definitively demonstrate the Lys-63- and Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chain formation on IRAK in response to IL-1. One important question is then what is the E3 protein ligase responsible for IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination. TRAF6, a RING domain protein, has been shown to function as a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 in conjunction with E2 Ubc13/Uev1A to mediate Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination and lead to the activation of TAK1. We recently found that TRAF6 has the ability to mediate Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination when UbcH5 was used as E2 in vitro. However, IL-1 was still able to induce IRAK ubiquitination and degradation in TRAF6-deficient MEFs (data not shown), indicating that TRAF6 is not the E3 responsible for IL-1-induced K-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination. Recent studies showed that serine/threonine kinase Rip is ubiquitinated via Lys-63- and Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chain by TRAF2 and A20, respectively, and competitively through the same ubiquitination site (12Wertz I.E. O'Rourke K.M. Zhou H. Eby M. Aravind L. Seshagiri S. Wu P. Wiesmann C. Baker R. Boone D.L. Ma A. Koonin E.V. Dixit V.M. Nature. 2004; 430: 694-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). A20 is unlikely to mediate Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination, because A20 has been shown to play a negative regulatory role in TLR signaling by deubiquitinating TRAF6 (13Boone D.L. Turer E.E. Lee E.G. Ahmad R.C. Wheeler M.T. Tsui C. Hurley P. Chien M. Chai S. Hitotsumatsu O. McNally E. Pickart C. Ma A. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 1052-1060Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), whereas our study suggests a positive role for Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in IL-1 signaling. It seems unlikely for the other Pellino family members to mediate IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination, because the Pellino proteins only exhibited E3 activity for Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination in vivo (Fig. 4, C and D) (28Ordureau A. Smith H. Windheim M. Peggie M. Carrick E. Morrice N. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2008; 409: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, one possibility is that IL-1-induced phosphorylation of Pellinos (such as Pellino 2) by IRAK changes its specificity from Lys-63 to Lys-48 conjugations in vivo. Therefore, it would be premature to completely exclude the potential role of Pellinos as E3s required for IL-1-induced Lys-48-linked IRAK ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. In support of this, Pellinos were able to combine with UbcH3 to catalyze Lys-48-linked polyubiquitination in vitro. The timing of action, formation of specific signaling complexes, and relative expression levels of Pellinos in vivo might account for the differential mechanisms exerted by Pellino2 versus Pellino 3b in IL-1 signaling. Future studies are required to clarify the multiple steps of IRAK polyubiquitination and their specific roles in IRAK-mediated signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2025983519,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Gal4 protein is a paradigmatic transcriptional activator containing a C-terminal acidic activation domain (AD) of 34 amino acids. A mutation that results in the truncation of about two-thirds of the Gal4AD (gal4D) results in a crippled protein with only 3% the activity of the wild-type activator. We show here that although the Gal4D protein is not intrinsically deficient in DNA binding, it is nonetheless unable to stably occupy GAL promoters in vivo. This is because of the activity of the proteasomal ATPases, including Sug1/Rpt6, which bind to Gal4D via the remainder of the AD and strip it off of DNA. A mutation that suppressed the Gal4D ""no growth on galactose"" phenotype repressed the stripping activity of the ATPase complex but not other activities. We further demonstrate that Gal4D is hypersensitive to this stripping activity because of its failure to be monoubiquitylated efficiently in vivo and in vitro. Evidence is presented that the piece of the AD that is deleted in Gal4D protein is likely a recognition element for the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that modifies Gal4. These data argue that acidic ADs comprise at least two small peptide subdomains, one of which is responsible for activator monoubiquitylation and another that interacts with the proteasomal ATPases, coactivators and other transcription factors. This study validates the physiological importance of Gal4 monoubiquitylation and clarifies its major role as that of protecting the activator from being destabilized by the proteasomal ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2033509883,"In the nervous system, Cdk5 and its neuronal activator p35 are involved in the control of various activities, including neuronal differentiation and migration. Recently, we have reported that p35 is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates microtubule dynamics (Hou, Z., Li, Q., He, L., Lim, H. Y., Fu, X., Cheung, N. S., Qi, D. X., and Qi, R. Z. (2007 J. Biol. Chem. 282, 18666-18670). Here we present two regulatory modes of p35 function as a microtubule-associated protein. First, p35 is Ca2+-dependent calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein. The CaM- and microtubule binding domains are localized to overlapping regions at the N terminus of p35. Within the CaM-binding region, Ala substitution for Trp-52 abolishes the CaM-binding activity, corroborating specific CaM-binding of p35. Furthermore, CaM blocks p35 association with microtubules in a Ca2+-specific manner, suggesting that p35 may be involved in the Ca2+/CaM-mediated inhibition of microtubule assembly. Second, p35 phosphorylation by Cdk5 interferes with the microtubule-binding and polymerizing activities of p35. Using a mutational approach, we found that only phosphorylation at Thr-138, one of the two residues primarily phosphorylated in vivo, inhibits the polymerizing activity. In PC12 cells, expression of p35 promotes nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth under a Cdk5 inhibitory condition. Such p35 activity is impaired by the phosphomimetic mutation of Thr-138. These data suggest that Thr-138 phosphorylation plays a critical role in the control of the p35 functions in microtubule assembly and neurite outgrowth.

Being a major cytoskeletal element in eukaryotic cells and particularly abundant in nerve cells, microtubules intimately regulate cell mobility and morphology. Microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; CaM, calmodulin; NGF, nerve growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 2The abbreviations used are: MAP, microtubule-associated protein; CaM, calmodulin; NGF, nerve growth factor; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. are a family of proteins that bind to, stabilize, and promote assembly of microtubules (1Maccioni R.B. Cambiazo V. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 835-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The microtubule-binding and stabilizing activities of MAPs are regulated by a number of factors in response to internal and external signals. Among them, Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) exerts an inhibitory effect on microtubule integrity via binding to MAPs (2Sobue K. Fujita M. Muramoto Y. Kakiuchi S. FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 3Lee Y.C. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1226-1230Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lee Y.C. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6306-6310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In MAPs, the binding domains of Ca2+/CaM and microtubules are usually adjacent to each other or even overlapping, pointing to competitive binding of Ca2+/CaM and microtubules to the MAPs (5Lee Y.C. Wolff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8041-8044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bosc C. Frank R. Denarier E. Ronjat M. Schweitzer A. Wehland J. Job D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30904-30913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also, MAPs often exist as phosphoproteins in vivo. Phosphorylation of MAPs at different sites may exert different effects on microtubule association. For example, association of tau with microtubules is negatively regulated by glycogen synthase kinase 3β-mediated phosphorylation of tau at primed sites but not by phosphorylation at unprimed sites (7Cho J.H. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of MAPs may have site-specific effects on their functions. Cdk5 is one of the protein kinases implicated to participate in the regulation of microtubule dynamics by phosphorylating MAPs. In association with the p35 activator, which is almost exclusively expressed in central nervous system neurons, Cdk5 plays an essential role in proper development of the nervous system (8Dhavan R. Tsai L.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 749-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar, 9Lim A.C. Qu D. Qi R.Z. Neurosignals. 2003; 12: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). During corticogenesis, postmitotic neurons migrate from the neuroepithelium to the cortical plate, where they eventually form the mature cortical layers. Mice deficient of Cdk5 or p35 have abnormally structured cortices because of defects in neuronal migration (10Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). In addition, blocking of Cdk5 activity in cultured neurons inhibits neurite outgrowth, pointing to an essential role of Cdk5 in neuronal differentiation (12Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Several MAPs have been identified to be Cdk5 substrates; the Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of tau and doublecortin interferes with their microtubule-binding and stabilizing activities, whereas the phosphorylation of MAP1 appears to enhance its microtubule-binding affinity (13Baumann K.

Under neurotoxic conditions, p35 is cleaved by the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain to generate p25, which loses 98 residues at the N terminus (18Kusakawa G. Saito T. Onuki R. Ishiguro K. Kishimoto T.

The resulting Cdk5-p25 complex shows aberrant control of the kinase activity, causing tau hyperphosphorylation and, thus, microtubule disruption and neuronal cell death (20Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L.

Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). After Cdk5 activation, p35 is phosphorylated by Cdk5. This phosphorylation occurs primarily at two residues, Ser-8 and Thr-138, among the four putative targeting sites (23Kamei H. Saito T. Ozawa M. Fujita Y. Asada A. Bibb J.A. Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thr-138 phosphorylation conversely correlates with brain development, with the highest level detected in fetal brain but undetectable in adult brain; Ser-8 phosphorylation remains unchanged during development (23Kamei H. Saito T. Ozawa M. Fujita Y. Asada A. Bibb J.A. Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Hisanaga S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1687-1694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, phosphorylation at these two residues is differentially regulated. p35 is a short-lived protein subjected to degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (24Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T.

Phosphorylation of p35 increases its susceptibility to proteasome-dependent degradation and suppresses the calpain-mediated transformation into p25 (23Kamei H. Saito T. Ozawa M. Fujita Y. Asada A.

Moreover, Thr-138 phosphorylation appears to be critical in determining resistance to the calpain-mediated cleavage (23Kamei H. Saito T. Ozawa M. Fujita Y. Asada A. Bibb J.A. Saido T.C. Sorimachi H.

Therefore, phosphorylation at the two residues contributes differentially to the control of p35 levels. Recently, p35 has been shown to be a MAP that promotes microtubule assembly and induces bundling of the filaments (26Hou Z. Li Q. He L. Lim H.Y. Fu X. Cheung N.S. Qi D.X. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18666-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear how these microtubule-associated functions are regulated. In this study, p35 is identified to interact with CaM in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and the CaM binding blocks p35 association with microtubules. In addition, the microtubule-binding and polymerizing activities of p35 are regulated by Cdk5-catalyzed phosphorylation of p35. p35 displays activity independent of Cdk5 activation to promote nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite formation. We characterized the effects of p35 phosphorylation on its microtubule binding and polymerizing activities as well as its Cdk5 activation-independent activity in neurite outgrowth. DNA Constructs—Construction of Cdk5 and p35 plasmids used in this report was described previously (27Fu X. Choi Y.K. Qu D. Yu Y. Cheung N.S. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39014-39021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). p35(S8A/T138A/S170A/T197A) was a gift from Dr. Li-Huei Tsai (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) (24Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24057-24064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Truncations and point mutations were created by PCR methods. The constructs were all verified by DNA sequencing. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: anti-Cdk5 (J-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-tubulin (clone TUB2.1, Sigma), anti-CaM (clone 6D4, Sigma), anti-GST (GE Healthcare), anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-V5 (Invitrogen), anti-His6 (H-15, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-FLAG (Sigma). Protein Expression and Purification—Bacterial expression of GST- and His6-tagged proteins were performed using Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expressed proteins were purified by binding of His6 to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) or GST to GSH-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) (27Fu X. Choi Y.K. Qu D. Yu Y. Cheung N.S. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 39014-39021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The isolated proteins contained full-length p35 and its proteolytic fragments. To determine the contents of full-length p35, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide gels), and the resolved patterns were analyzed using the ChemiDoc XRS system and the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). The p35-His6 and GST-p35 preparations contained full-length p35 at 30 and 15%, respectively. To express CaM in bacteria, human CaM gene III was subcloned from a pcDNA3 construct (a gift from Dr. Donald C. Chang, Ref. 28Li C.J. Heim R. Lu P. Pu Y. Tsien R.Y. Chang D.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1567-1577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the vector pET32a. The construct expresses His6-CaM. After purification using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin, the tag moiety was removed by cleavage at room temperature using enterokinase (Novagen) in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, and 2 mm MgCl2. Proteins to be used in microtubule binding or assembly assays were dialyzed in PEM buffer (80 mm K-PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) plus 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. Otherwise, proteins were dialyzed in the buffer of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm benzamidine, and 5% glycerol. Before use in assays, proteins were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C (100,000 × g; 30 min). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad (Bradford) protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard. CaM concentration was also verified by measuring absorbance at 277 nm with 3300 m-1 as the extinction coefficient (29Klee C.B. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1017-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). CaM-Binding Assays—In CaM-Sepharose binding assays, p35-derived recombinant proteins (1 μg) were mixed with CaM-conjugated Sepharose (10 μl; GE Healthcare) in 200 μl of binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. As a control, blank Sepharose was used instead of CaM-conjugated Sepharose. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C, the beads were extensively rinsed. The bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. In GST pulldown assays, GST and GST-p35 (2 μg) were allowed to bind to CaM (1 μg) under the above conditions. The GST proteins were then retrieved using GSH beads to analyze bound proteins on anti-CaM immunoblots. To measure Ca2+ concentration required for p35 binding with CaM, we performed equilibrium dialysis. All stock solutions were passed through a Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) column to remove contaminating divalent cations (30Teo T.S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5950-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaM and p35 were dialyzed separately against binding buffer containing increasing amounts of CaCl2. After the equilibrium was reached, the proteins were subjected to the binding test. To test the effects of Sr2+ and Ba2+, CaM and p35 were dialyzed against binding buffer containing 0.1 mm EGTA and then subjected to the binding assay in the presence of 1 mm SrCl2 or BaCl2. Microtubule Sedimentation—MAP-free tubulin was purified from porcine brain as detailed by Hou et al. (26Hou Z. Li Q. He L. Lim H.Y. Fu X. Cheung N.S. Qi D.X. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18666-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). p35 proteins were purified from bacterial expressions or expressed in HEK293T. HEK293T lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection in cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C (14,000 × g; 20 min). Microtubules, pre-polymerized from MAP-free tubulin (15 μg) in PEM buffer plus 1 mm GTP, 50 μm taxol, and 0.2% Triton X-100, were incubated with recombinant p35 proteins or p35-expressing lysates of HEK293T as indicated in 100 μl of the same buffer at room temperature for 30 min. Microtubules and associated proteins were pelleted at 4 °C (100,000 × g; 15 min) through a cushion of 50% glycerol in the buffer. The supernatants and the pellets were collected separately for immunoblotting. Microtubule Assembly—Microtubule assembly was assayed by monitoring turbidity changes of solutions at 35 °C for 30 min (26Hou Z. Li Q. He L. Lim H.Y. Fu X. Cheung N.S. Qi D.X. Qi R.Z. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures contained MAP-free tubulin (10 μm) and p35-derived proteins in 100 μl of PEM buffer plus 1 mm GTP and 10 mm MgCl2. To examine microtubules by fluorescence microscopy, rhodamine-labeled (Cytoskeleton) and unlabeled MAP-free tubulin were used at the ratio of 1:10 in the assembly (31Lim A.C. Tiu S.Y. Li Q. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4433-4439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Polymerized microtubules were observed under an inverted Nikon microscope (Eclipse TE2000). Protein Phosphorylation—Protein phosphorylation was measured in Cdk5-p35 complexes reconstituted from the purified recombinant proteins or immunoprecipitated from cells expressing Cdk5 and p35. The Cdk5-p35 complexes were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h in a kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP (∼5000 dpm/pmol). The reactions were terminated by boiling for 5 min in the SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Before autoradiography, the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting—Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on 10% acrylamide gels and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The following conditions were applied to immunoblotting of CaM (32Hulen D. Baron A. Salisbury J. Clarke M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1991; 18: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Samples were boiled in SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer supplemented with 1 mm EGTA. After electrophoresis of 12% acrylamide gels, proteins were transferred in 25 mm KH2/K2HPO4 buffer (pH 7.0; KP buffer) at 20 V overnight at 4 °C. The blots were incubated at room temperature for 45 min in 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde freshly prepared in KP buffer. After the incubation, the blots were rinsed in KP buffer, blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin/Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and then subjected to incubation with anti-CaM antibody in 2% bovine serum albumin/TBS. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry—HEK293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum under the conditions of 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfection of plasmids were performed with the Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Differentiation was induced in low-serum medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.5% fetal bovine serum and 0.5% horse serum) containing 50 ng/ml NGF (Sigma). To inhibit Cdk5 activity, GW8510 (4-([(7-oxo-6,7-dihydro-8H-[1,3]thiazolo[5,4-e]indol-8-ylidene)methyl]amino)-N-(2-pyridinyl)benzenesulfonamide, Sigma) was applied at 2 μm in the culture medium. After differentiation, cells were fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 5% sucrose for microscopic analysis. Images were acquired on the Nikon microscope. Neurite length and cell body diameter were determined using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging). Cells with at least one visible process equal to or greater than two cell bodies were counted as positive for neurite formation. Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test for comparison among multiple groups and using Student's unpaired two tails t tests for comparison between two groups. For all comparisons, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. p35 Is a CaM-binding Protein—CaM-binding domains are usually short peptide stretches with defined sequence and structural features (33Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 34Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Analysis of the p35 protein sequence using a web-based method (33Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar) revealed an unclassified CaM-binding sequence spanning residues 40-50. We tested the predicted binding in a pulldown assay using CaM-conjugated beads and purified recombinant p35. p35 was readily detected to interact with CaM in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the binding was abolished when EGTA was added instead of Ca2+ (Fig. 1A). In a reciprocal assay, GST-p35 pulled down CaM only in the presence Ca2+, whereas GST did not bind to CaM (Fig. 1B). We proceeded to evaluate the effect of Ca2+ concentrations and found that the interaction was detected even at 20 μm but not at 5 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 1C). Together, p35 displayed Ca2+-dependent association with CaM. It has been known that divalent cations with ionic radii close to Ca2+ (e.g. Sr2+) can induce conformational change of CaM to effectively stimulate it, as revealed by CaM-dependent phosphodiesterase activation (30Teo T.S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5950-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chao S.H. Suzuki Y. Zysk J.R. Cheung W.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). However, cations with different ionic radii (e.g. Ba2+) are ineffective (30Teo T.S. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 5950-5955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chao S.H. Suzuki Y. Zysk J.R. Cheung W.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 1984; 26: 75-82PubMed Google Scholar). We tested Sr2+ and Ba2+ in the p35-binding assay. Similar to Ca2+, Sr2+ effectively stimulated CaM binding of p35 (Fig. 1D). In contrast, Ba2+ exhibited a negligible effect (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that p35 binds specifically to CaM activated by the cations. To define the CaM-binding region, we assayed CaM binding of several p35 fragments under the Ca2+-containing condition. The p35 fragments were tagged with GST for purification from bacterial expression. The purified proteins contained both the full-length protein constructs and their truncated forms, as shown on the immunoblot (Fig. 1E). GST-p10 bound strongly to CaM, whereas the truncated GST fusion proteins in the preparation did not show binding activities (Fig. 1E). In addition, p25 did not bind to CaM (Fig. 1E). These results indicate the presence of a CaM-binding domain within the p10 region. Next, two fragments, 1-52 and 31-90, both of which contain the predicted CaM-binding sequence, were tested in the assay. CaM was observed to bind with 31-90 but not with 1-52 (Fig. 1E). The CaM-binding sequence appeared to be discrepant from that predicted from the web-based analysis. Within the identified CaM-binding region, a segment of 30 amino acids is highly conserved in p35 ranging from Drosophila to human (Fig. 1F). A Trp residue, which plays a key role in interaction between CaM and many of its targets (36Osawa M. Tokumitsu H. Swindells M.B. Kurihara H. Orita M. Shibanuma T. Furuya T. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 819-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 37Rainaldi M. Yamniuk A.P. Murase T. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6031-6042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), is found in the middle of this conserved region and is present in all of the listed species (Fig. 1F). We mutated this Trp residue and found that the mutation W52A eliminated the CaM-binding activity of p35 (Fig. 1G). Collectively, these results demonstrate that CaM binds to a conserved p35 region, within which Trp-52 is critically involved in such interaction. Microtubule-Binding Regions of p35—Previously, we showed direct association of p35 with microtubules via p10 (26Hou Z. Li Q. He L. Lim H.Y. Fu X. Cheung N.S. Qi D.X. Qi R.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18666-18670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To delineate the microtubule-binding domains, we constructed several fragments of p10 and tested their microtubule-binding activities. In the sedimentation assay, microtubules were assembled from MAP-free tubulin and stabilized with taxol. Under the assay conditions, most of the tubulin was polymerized into microtubule polymers, as revealed from tubulin distribution between the supernatants and the microtubule pellets from the sedimentation (Fig. 2). After the recombinant proteins derived from p10 were incubated with taxol-stabilized microtubules, the samples were subjected to sedimentation of the microtubules to detect co-sedimented proteins. Two non-overlapping fragments, 1-52 and 53-88, displayed strong microtubule-binding activities similar to p10 (Fig. 2). When the region of 53-98 was split into two constructs, 53-72 but not 72-98 retained such binding activity (Fig. 2). These results indicate that p35 harbors two microtubule-binding domains at the N terminus. Given that the region of 31-90 is responsible for binding to CaM, the microtubule-binding domains substantially overlap with the CaM-binding domain. Ca2+-CaM Inhibits p35 Association with Microtubules—We probed whether CaM affects p35 association with microtubules. When the sedimentation assay was performed under the conditions with Ca2+ (i.e. 1 mm CaCl2) and without CaM, p35 sedimented with microtubules but did not sediment in the absence of microtubules (Fig. 3A), indicative of the microtubule association. When CaM was applied to the sedimentation assay, CaM did not bind to microtubules, and p35 diminished from the microtubule fraction in a manner dependent on the concentration of Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3A). Next, we tested the Ca2+ dependence of the CaM effect. In the assay without Ca2+, where 5 mm EGTA was added instead, CaM showed no discernible effect on p35 co-sedimentation with microtubules (Fig. 3B). Therefore, CaM interferes with the interaction between p35 and microtubules in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Moreover, when the CaM-non-binding mutant p35(W52A) was tested in the assay, its association with microtubules was unaffected by Ca2+/CaM (Fig. 3B). Together, we conclude that the binding of Ca2+/CaM to p35 inhibits p35 interaction with microtubules. Effects of p35 Phosphorylation on Its Microtubule-polymerizing and Binding Activities—As a substrate, p35 is phosphorylated by Cdk5 (24Patrick G.N. Zhou P. Kwon Y.T. Howley P.M. Tsai L.H. J. Biol.

In the microtubule assembly assay, Cdk5 itself did not exhibit any activity on microtubule assembly (Fig. 4A). The reconstitution of the Cdk5-p35 complex under the protein phosphorylation condition abolished the microtubule-polymerizing activity of p35 (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the polymerizing activity was not significantly affected under each of the following conditions; 1) p35 was incubated under the phosphorylation conditions without Cdk5, 2) p35 was reconstituted with the kinase-dead mutant Cdk5(N144) under the phosphorylation conditions, and 3) p35 was reconstituted with wild type Cdk5 in the absence of ATP-Mg2+ (Fig. 4A). To detect protein phosphorylation, we performed an in vitro kinase reaction using the p35 and Cdk5 proteins. p35 was phosphorylated by Cdk5 but not by Cdk5(N144) or in the absence of the Cdk5 proteins (Fig. 4B). In addition, Cdk5 phosphorylation was not detectable (F"

The precise mechanisms that enable the relay of nucleotide hydrolysis to their specific functional outputs are largely unknown. Here we use PspF, a specialized AAA+ protein required for enhancer-dependent transcription activation in Escherichia coli, as a model system to address this question. We demonstrate that a conserved asparagine is involved in internal organization of the oligomeric ring, regulation of ATPase activity by “trans” factors, and optimizing substrate remodeling. We provide evidence that the spatial relationship between the asparagine residue and the Walker B motif is one key element in the conformational signaling pathway that leads to substrate remodeling. Such functional organization most likely applies to other AAA+ proteins, including Ltag (simian virus 40), Rep40 (Adeno-associated virus-2), and p97 (Mus musculus) in which the asparagine to Walker B motif relationship is conserved.

AAA+ proteins (ATPases associated with various cellular activities) are present in all kingdoms of life and play important roles in numerous cellular activities, including proteolysis, protein folding, membrane trafficking, cytoskeletal regulation, organelle biogenesis, DNA replication, and DNA transcription. AAA+ ATPases invariably contain Walker A and B motifs that define them as P-loop ATPases and a conserved sequence termed the second region of homology and function as higher order oligomers, which remodel their substrates in reactions that consume ATP (1Dougan D.A.

In many cases, AAA+ domains assemble into hexameric rings that change their conformation during the ATPase cycle. This nucleotide-dependent conformational change may, for example, apply mechanical tension to bound proteins or nucleic acids and thereby allow AAA+ proteins to remodel their substrate. The energy-dependent nature of their activities and their organization as ring assemblies raises important issues about how they function as molecular machines to engage with, and remodel, their targets. A common area of functionality that is poorly understood concerns how nucleotide binding and hydrolysis is relayed within the ring structure to allow formation of the functional states that accompany and drive substrate remodeling. Importantly, AAA+ proteins represent a large class of mechano-chemical enzymes that have evolved many ways of using a fundamentally similar conformational change in different biological settings (8Tucker P.A. Sallai L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2007; 17: 641-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, these proteins often become specialized by the insertion of specific motifs within the minimal AAA+ core. One well studied example of this specialization is represented by the family of bacterial enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) 3The abbreviations used are: bEBP, bacterial enhancer-binding protein; WT, wild type PspF1–275; W56A, PspF1–275 W56A; N64A, PspF1–275 N64A; N64D, PspF1–275 N64D; N64Q, PspF1–275 N64Q; N64S, PspF1–275 N64S; E108A, PspF1–275 E108A; E108D, PspF1–275 E108D; E108Q, PspF1–275 E108Q; N64v, Asn-64 variants; E108v, Glu-108 variants; E, RNA polymerase core enzyme; CC, closed complex; OC, open complex; APAB, p-azidophenacyl bromide; wt, wild type; RNAP, RNA polymerase; ADP-AlFx, ADP aluminum fluoride; ADP-BeFx, ADP berilium fluoride; AMP-AlFx, AMP aluminum fluoride. required for σ54-dependent transcription activation (9Rappas M.

These bEBPs are members of a sub-class of AAA+ proteins known as the presensor I β-hairpin super-clade and include the helicases RuvB, Ltag, and MCM as well as proteases HslU, ClpX, and Lon (21Iyer L.M. Leipe D.D. Koonin E.V. Aravind L. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In this study, we use the bEBP model, PspF (phage shock protein F), from Escherichia coli, which is composed of: (i) a catalytic AAA+ domain sufficient to activate σ54-dependent transcription in vivo and in vitro (PspF1–275, see Fig. 1A), and (ii) a C-terminal helix-turn-helix domain, which binds the upstream activator sequence of the pspA and pspG specific promoters. In addition, PspF activity is negatively regulated by PspA (22Jovanovic G. Rakonjac J. Model P. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 469-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 23Lloyd L.J. Jones S.E.

Microbiol. 2005; 57: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that substitution of the highly conserved Walker B glutamate residue (Glu-108 in PspF) allowed ATP-dependent stable complex formation between PspF and σ54 (or Eσ54) (25Joly N. Rappas M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Zhang X. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using a functional approach, we established roles of the Walker B Glu-108 residue in establishing nucleotide-dependent interactions between the GAFTGA motif and σ54. Our functional data, in combination with crystal structures of PspF1–275 soaked with different nucleotides, suggest that residue Glu-108 relays ATP hydrolysis to remodel the Eσ54·DNA CC. Analysis of the different nucleotide-bound structures of PspF1–275 demonstrated that a tight interaction between Walker B residues Glu-108 and Asn-64 occurs in the ATP-bound state, proposed to facilitate the exposure of the GAFTGA motif. However, Glu-108 is dispensable for ATP-dependent binding of PspF1–275 to the CC (25Joly N. Rappas M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Zhang X. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis was suggested to disrupt the E108-N64 interaction, resulting in repositioning of the GAFTGA motif (26Rappas M. Schumacher J. Niwa H. Buck M. Zhang X. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 357: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Despite these observations and mutagenesis studies, the precise signaling pathway relaying nucleotide hydrolysis-dependent events to OC formation remains unknown. Sequence alignments of bEBPs show that the Walker B motif-interacting asparagine (Asn-64 in PspF) is strictly conserved, suggesting this residue may play an important role in bEBP activities. This asparagine is not present in all AAA+ proteins, however structural alignment of PspF with other AAA+ proteins demonstrates conservation of the asparagine (corresponding to Asn-64) in several proteins (Fig. 1, B and C). Interestingly, all the AAA+ proteins (PspF, NtrC1, ZraR, Cdc6, Cdc6p, Ltag, RFC, RFCS, p97, Orc1, Orc2, PNK, and Rep40), which possess this conserved asparagine (Fig. 1, B and C, in red), also maintain the distance between this residue and the Walker B residues (Fig. 1, B and C, in green). Indeed, we note that in the case of Rep40 where the asparagine (Fig. 1, B and C, in orange) is not aligned structurally, the Walker B residues (Fig. 1, B and C, in purple) are also not aligned thereby maintaining a similar asparagine-Walker B distance as observed for other AAA+ proteins. These observations suggest that communication between the asparagine and Walker B residues and the distance between them could be important for protein functionality. Understanding the communication mechanism between residues of the same or adjacent subunits of AAA+ proteins is important for understanding their global mechanisms of action. Determining how the positioning of the “functional motif” (GAFTGA in bEBPs), responsible for interacting with its target (σ54), is regulated can provide insight into how AAA+ proteins use ATP binding and hydrolysis, and evolve to become specialized. In this study, we investigated the contribution of residue Asn-64 to nucleotide-dependent outputs of PspF, which we used as a model system, and its role in relaying nucleotide hydrolysis to remodeling of the Eσ54·DNA CC. We provide evidence for the direct contribution of residue Asn-64 in the catalytic ATPase activity and hexameric organization of PspF and demonstrate a clear role for Asn-64 in the efficient relay of ATPase activity to substrate remodeling during OC formation. In addition, we show that the negative regulation imposed by PspA on PspF ATPase activity (but not PspA binding) is dependent on Asn-64, confirming its central role in PspF functionality. Finally, we demonstrate Asn-64 variants are affected in a stage of the transcription activation process that follows σ54 isomerization. We show that functionalities dependent upon Asn-64, which primarily involves interactions between PspF and σ54, are also sensitive to core RNAP enzyme and to promoter DNA conformation. Plasmids—Plasmid pPB1 encodes E. coli PspF1–275 with an N-terminal 6-His tag in pET28b+ (27Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Variants of PspF1–275 were generated from plasmid pPB1 mutagenized to yield pPB1-N64A (AAC → GCC), pPB1-N64D (AAC → GAA), pPB1-N64Q (AAC → AGC), and pPB1-N64S (AAC → GAC). Constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Protein Purification—PspF1–275 proteins were purified as described (28Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). σ54 was purified as described in a previous study (10Cannon W.V. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). His-PspA was purified as described previously (29Elderkin S. Jones S. Schumacher J. Studholme D. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). E. coli core RNAP enzyme was purchased from Epicentre. Filter Nucleotide Binding Assay—Nucleotide binding assays were performed in 25-μl final volume containing: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm PspF1–275 variants. The mix was preincubated at 4 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was started by adding 7.5 μl of an ATP solution containing 0.3 μCi/μl [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) or 0.3 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. Binding reactions were then filtered through a Protan nitrocellulose 0.45-μm filter (Whatman) placed on a slot blot 48-well system (Hoefler, Inc.), and a vacuum was briefly applied (10 s) to remove the liquid. After sample application, the membrane was immediately washed with 1 ml of washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 15 mm MgCl2) at 4 °C. Radioactivity retained in the membrane was measured by using a phosphorimaging device (Fuji Bas-1500) and analyzed using the Aida software. All experiments were carried out at least five times, and fluctuations of binding values were up to 30% of WT values. ATPase Activity—The ATPase activity assays were performed in a 10-μl final volume, in buffer containing final concentrations of: 35 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 70 mm potassium acetate, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 19 mm ammonium acetate, 0.7 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 μm PspF1–275 (or 1 μm PspF1–275 ± 5.2 μm His-PspA). The mix was preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and the reaction was started by adding 3 μl of an ATP solution containing 0.6 μCi/μl [α-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) plus 0.1 mm ATP and incubated for varying times at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by addition of 5 volumes of 2 m formic acid. The [α-32P]ADP was separated from ATP by TLC, and radiolabeled ADP and ATP were measured by phosphorimaging and analyzed using the Aida software. Activity is expressed as a percentage of PspF1–275 WT turnover value. All experiments were carried out in triplicate (at least), and fluctuations of turnover values were maximally 10%. Gel Filtration through Superdex 200—PspF1–275 WT and N64v (at different concentrations) were incubated for 5 min at 4 °C in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2, ± 0.5 mm ATP or ADP where indicated. 50-μl samples were then injected onto a Superdex 200 column (10 × 300 mm, 24 ml, GE Healthcare) and equilibrated with the sample buffer with or without nucleotide. Chromatography was performed at 4 °C at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and columns were calibrated with globular proteins: apoferritin (443 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa). All experiments were repeated at least four times, and the elution profiles obtained were similar. β-Galactosidase Assays—Cells were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing the appropriate antibiotic and then diluted 100-fold (initial A600 ∼ 0.025) into 5 ml of LB. Following incubation to A600 ∼ 0.30, cultures were induced with different concentrations of arabinose for 1 h (as indicated), further grown to mid-exponential phase (A600 ∼ 0.5–0.6) and than assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described before (30Miller, J. H. (1972) Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). Enzyme activities (in Miller units) represent the means ± S.D. of the triplicate average values from at least two independent cultures. Affinity Chromatography with Immobilized PspA—Affinity chromatography was performed at 4 °C in Micro Biospin® Bio-Rad columns packed with 50 μl of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Solutions were passed through the columns by centrifugation at 5 × g for 30 s. The columns were equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, and 15 mm MgCl2) and loaded with 500 μl of 6 μm His-PspA. The columns were washed with buffer A (1 ml), and purified PspF1–275 WT or W56A or N64v (400 μl at 3.6 μm) was allowed to flow through the column. Unbound proteins were removed by washing with 5 × 100 μl of buffer A plus 40 mm imidazole. His-tagged PspA was eluted with 2 × 100 μl buffer A plus 500 mm imidazole. 100-μl fractions were collected, and 20 μl was analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. Native Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were conducted to detect protein·protein or protein·DNA complexes. Assays were performed in a 10-μl final volume containing: 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ADP, ± NaF (5 mm) ± σ54 (1 μm) ± core RNAP (0.15 μm) ± 0.2 μm HEX-labeled DNA probe. Where required, PspF1–275 WT or N64v (5 μm) ± AlCl3 (0.4 mm) were added for a further 10 min at 37 °C. Complexes were analyzed on a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were detected by Coomassie Blue staining and fluorescent HEX-DNA was measured by phosphorimaging and analyzed using the Aida software. In Vitro Full-length or Abortive Transcription Assays—Full-length or abortive transcription assays were performed in a 10-μl volume containing: 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm dATP, 0.1 μm core RNAP enzyme, 0.4 μm σ54, and 20 nm promoter DNA. The mix was preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and the reaction was started by addition of 5 μm of PspF1–275 WT or N64v and incubated for varying times at 37 °C. Full-length transcription (from the supercoiled Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter) was initiated by adding a mix containing 100 μg/ml heparin, 1 mm ATP, CTP, GTP, 0.05 mm UTP, and 3 μCi of [α-32P]UTP for a further 10 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of loading buffer and analyzed on 6% sequencing gels. Synthesis of the abortive transcript (UpGGG) was initiated by addition of heparin (100 μg/ml), the dinucleotide UpG (0.5 mm), GTP (0.01 mm), and 4 μCi of [α-32P]GTP for a further 10 min. The reaction was quenched by addition of loading buffer and analyzed on a 20% denaturating gel. Radiolabeled RNA products were measured by phosphorimaging and analyzed using the Aida software. Photo-cross-linking Assays in Solution—Photo-cross-linking assays were performed as described in (25Joly N. Rappas M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Zhang X. Buck M. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly reactions were performed in a volume of 10 μl containing: 10 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.0), 50 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm dATP or ADP, ± NaF (5 mm) ± σ54 (1 μm) ± core RNAP (0.3 μm) ± and 0.1 μm 32P-labeled p-azidophenacyl bromide (APAB, Sigma) conjugated phosphorothiolated promoter DNA probes prepared as described (31Burrows P.C. Severinov K. Buck M. Wigneshweraraj S.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4253-4263Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Mayer A.N. Barany F. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 153: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When required, PspF1–275 WT or variants (5 μm) ± AlCl3 (0.4 mm) was added for a further 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were then UV irradiated at 365 nm for 1 min using a UV-Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). 2 μl of the reaction mix was directly loaded on a native 4.5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide 37.5/1) and run in 1× TG buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 8.3) and 192 mm glycine). The remaining reaction mix was diluted by addition of 10 μl of loading dye, heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and loaded (9 μl) onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Gels were then dried, and cross-linked protein·DNA complexes were visualized by phosphorimaging analysis. To assess the contribution of the asparagine (Asn-64) to PspF activity we chose to substitute Asn-64 for: (i) alanine, to completely remove the side chain, (ii) aspartate, to add a charge but maintain the size of the side chain, (iii) glutamine, to maintain the charge but increase the size of the side chain, and (iv) serine, to reduce the size of the side chain and to alter the charge. Properties of the AAA+ domain of PspF (PspF1–275) variants were analyzed to determine how the functionality of PspF depends on Asn-64. Asn-64 Contributes to Nucleotide Binding, Hydrolysis, and Self-association—We first determined whether the PspF1–275 Asn-64 variants (N64v) maintained their ability to bind and hydrolyze nucleotides (Fig. 2, A and B). The Asn-64 substitutions tested resulted in either an apparent increase (N64A, N64Q, and N64S) or decrease (N64D) in ATP binding, compared with PspF1–275 WT (WT). Having demonstrated that all the N64v were able to bind ATP (Fig. 2A), we next determined whether they were affected in their capacity to hydrolyze ATP (Fig. 2B). We observed that N64S ATPase activity was not affected, whereas the other N64v tested were all deficient for ATPase activity (N64S (100%) > N64A (36%) > N64Q (12%) > N64D (<0.4%)). We conclude that Asn-64 contributes to, but is not essential for, nucleotide binding and ATPase activity.FIGURE 1PspF organization and structural alignment.

A, nucleotide binding of PspF1–275 WT or N64v. Values obtained were compared with PspF1–275 WT, and all reactions were performed at least four times at 4 °C. In this condition, we were not able to detect ATPase activity. The error in these assays was ± 30%. B, ATPase activity of PspF1–275 WT or N64v (5 μm) at 37 °C and 0.1 mm of ATP.

The scale bars give the scale of the ordinate axis; absorption units (AU) correspond to an A280 nm of 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We have previously shown that the ATPase activity of PspF1–275 is directly related to its oligomeric state (a hexamer being the most active form) and that PspF1–275 oligomerization is strongly stimulated in the presence of nucleotides (ATP or ADP) (28Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Defects in oligomer formation are therefore predicted to negatively affect hydrolysis due to a loss in cooperativity between subunits. Because Asn-64 does not appear to be absolutely required for ATPase activity, we sought to determine whether a lack of ATPase activity was due to an effect on catalytic site formation comprising “in cis” and “in trans” residues, thereby potentially a global change in hexamer organization (28Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 33Schumacher J. Zhang X. Jones S. Bordes P. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 338: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of N64v on PspF1–275 oligomerization we performed gel filtration experiments and observed that in the absence of nucleotide, the elution profiles obtained with the N64v all differ from WT (Fig. 2C). When N64v hexamers formed, they had the same elution position as WT, suggesting no large scale changes in structure, as seen in some other PspF1–275 variants (28Joly N. Schumacher J. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34997-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We divided the N64v into three different classes: (i) constitutive hexamer formation (N64S), (ii) reduced hexamer formation (N64Q and N64A), and (iii) defective hexamer formation (N64D). In the presence of nucleotide (ATP or ADP), as with WT, a stimulatory effect on hexamerization was observed with N64A and N64Q (data not shown). However, N64D was still unable to form a hexamer. Overall, the results demonstrate that Asn-64 is important in ensuring the optimal oligomerization of PspF and therefore contributes to forming the active site of the protein (see “Discussion”). Formation of a Stable PspF1–275·Eσ54 Complex Is Dependent on N64—We then addressed the question whether the N64v can form biologically relevant complexes with (E)σ54. Stable in vitro interactions between PspF1–275 and its natural target (E)σ54 have been observed using non-hydrolysable nucleotide analogues ADP-AlFx, ADP-BeFx, and AMP-AlFx (34Chaney M. Grande R.

Using the transition state nucleotide analogue ADP-AlFx, we observed stable complexes between WT, N64A, N64Q, or N64S (but not N64D) and (E)σ54 (Fig. 3A). By estimating the relative quantities of complexes formed we show a defect in complex formation with the N64v (WT (100%) > N64A ∼ N64S (∼50%) > N64Q (∼35%) > N64D (below detection)). Interestingly, using AMP-AlFx a proposed ground-state analogue of ATP, we note a more pronounced defect in trapped complex formation by N64S than for t"

In addition to such oncogenic transformation, the cells undergo a dramatic morphological transformation: cell-cell contacts are disrupted, spreading on extracellular matrix proteins is suppressed, actin stress fibers and focal contacts are lost, and podosomes are formed. We have previously shown that integrin αvβ3 strongly supports Src-mediated oncogenic transformation through an interaction at the β3 cytoplasmic tail. Our current findings demonstrate that this interaction does not affect Src-mediated morphological alterations, thus separating oncogenic from morphological transformation. Moreover, β1 and β3 integrins differently affect the various aspects of Src-induced morphological transformation. High levels of β3, but not β1, integrins can prevent Src-induced cell rounding although stress fiber disassembly and podosome formation still occur. Studies using chimeric integrin subunits demonstrate that this protection requires the β3 extracellular domain. Finally, like tumor formation, podosome assembly occurs independent of β3 phosphorylation. Instead, phosphorylation of β1 is required to suppress Rho-mediated contractility in order to assemble podosomes. Thus, integrins regulate Src-mediated oncogenic transformation and various aspects of morphological transformation through dissociable pathways.

Biol. 2001; 2: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in mitogenic signaling, c-Src is a critical regulator of both cadherin- and integrin-mediated adhesion structures (9Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev.

While low levels of c-Src kinase activity or kinase-independent functions of c-Src can support the formation of cell-cell or cell-matrix adhesions (11McLachlan R.W. Kraemer A. Helwani F.M.

Indeed, expression of activated mutants of Src in epithelial cells induces scattering, loss of cytoskeletal contractility, weak adhesion, cell rounding, and the formation of highly dynamic cell-matrix adhesions termed podosomes that are considered to be hotspots for invasion and matrix remodeling (9Frame M.C.

It is not clear to what extent the signaling pathways activated by Src that are involved in oncogenic transformation overlap with those involved in the morphological transformation. Moreover, the different aspects of Src-induced morphological transformation may be connected (e.g. they may all be explained to some extent by loss of actomyosin contractility) or may involve activation of distinct signaling processes (e.g. separable alterations at cell-cell junctions, within the cytoskeletal contractility machinery, and at cell-matrix adhesions). In cell-matrix adhesions, integrins can serve as direct phosphorylation substrates of v-Src, which suppresses integrin function and weakens cell-matrix adhesion. Phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of β1 integrins was shown to be critical for v-Src-mediated morphological transformation (19Sakai T. Jove R. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Others have found that v-Src phosphorylates and reduces the affinity of β3, but not of β1, integrins, and instead an indirect mechanism that disrupts β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion was proposed (20Datta A. Shi Q. Boettiger D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7295-7306Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21Datta A. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3943-3949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To clarify how different integrins regulate the various aspects of Src-mediated morphological transformation and how this relates to oncogenic transformation, we have expressed a c-Src mutant that is constitutively in an open, primed conformation (c-Src[Y530F], here referred to as SrcYF) in the context of wild type, chimeric, and mutant β1 and β3 integrin subunits in two independent β1-deficient cell lines. While overexpression of αvβ3 augments SrcYF-mediated tumor growth through an interaction at the β3 cytoplasmic tail (22Huveneers S. van den Bout I. Sonneveld P. Sancho A. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2693-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the αvβ3 extracellular domain protects against SrcYF-induced cell rounding. Moreover, like tumor formation SrcYF-induced podosome assembly occurs independent of β3 phosphorylation. Instead, phosphorylation of β1 is required to suppress Rho-mediated contractility in order to assemble podosomes. Thus, integrins uncouple SrcYF-mediated oncogenic transformation and various aspects of morphological transformation. Cell Lines, Plasmids, Antibodies, and Other Materials—The β1-deficient GE11 and GD25 cells were previously described (23Gimond C. Der Flier A. van Delft S. Brakebusch C. Kuikman I. Collard J.G. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1325-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. To ensure identical expression of SrcYF in all cell lines, we first generated GESrcYF and GDSrcYF single cell clones and subsequently expressed the wild type, mutant, and chimeric integrin subunits using retroviral transduction and bulk sorting (22Huveneers S. van den Bout I. Sonneveld P. Sancho A. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2693-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Retroviral expression constructs for β1, β3, β1ex3in, β3ex1in, β3Y747A, and β3Y759A were described (22Huveneers S. van den Bout I. Sonneveld P. Sancho A. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H.

To compare wild type β3 and β3YYFF, pcDNA3-β3 (25Danen E.H. van Kraats A.A. Cornelissen I.M. Ruiter D.J. van Muijen G.N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 226: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and pRC/RSV-β3Y747F,Y759F (provided by Dr. Scott Blystone, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY), plasmids were transiently transfected in parallel using Effectene (Qiagen) and analyzed by immunofluorescence. The following integrin-specific antibodies have been used: anti-human β1 clones TS2/16, 18 (BD Transduction Laboratories) and K20 (Biomeda), anti-human β3 SSA6 (provided by Dr. Sanford Shattil, University of California, San Diego, CA), 23C6 (provided by Dr. Michael Horton, University College London, UK), C20 and N20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-murine β1 and α5 (clones MB1.2 and BMA5, respectively; provided by Dr. Bosco Chan, Robarts Research Institute, London, Canada). Other antibodies were anti-paxillin clone 349 (BD Transduction Laboratories), anti-RhoA clone 26C4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-vimentin clone K36 (provided by Dr. Frans Ramaekers, University of Maastricht, The Netherlands), polyclonal anti-Myc (A-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho tyrosine (pY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-tubulin clone B-5-1-2 (Sigma). Src-selective inhibitor PP2 and the inactive PP3 analogue were purchased from Calbiochem. Human plasma fibronectin (FN) 2The abbreviations used are: FN, fibronectin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. was prepared as described previously (24Danen E.H. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; Sigma) was conjugated to human plasma FN using borate buffer (Na2B4O7, pH 9.3, 40 mm NaCl) to generate FITC-FN. Short Term Adhesion Assays—Adhesion assays were performed in 96-well tissue culture plates that were coated with 5 μg/ml FN in PBS overnight at 4 °C, blocked with 2% heat-denatured bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 37 °C, and washed once with PBS. Cells were trypsinized, collected in culture medium, washed once with PBS, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/0.5% bovine serum albumin, and added to the plate at 2 × 104 cells/well. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, unattached cells were removed by rinsing the wells with PBS; the remaining attached cells were lysed and stained overnight at 37 °C in 3.75 mm p-nitrophenyl N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamide/0.05 m sodium citrate/0.25% Triton X-100. Stopbuffer (50 mm glycine, pH 10.4, 5 mm EDTA) was added, and the A405 was determined in triplicate wells and related to the A405 measured in wells in which all 2 × 104 cells were stained to calculate the percentage of adhered cells. Immunofluorescence and Flow Cytometry—For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.4% Triton X-100, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and incubated with anti-paxillin antibody or anti-human β3 (23C6), followed by Alexa-488-conjugated secondary antibody, rhodamine-phalloidin or TOPRO-3 staining (Molecular Probes). Preparations were mounted in Poly Aquamount (Polysciences, Inc.) and analyzed using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2100 confocal system. Images were obtained using a ×40 or ×60 oil objective and imported in Adobe Photoshop. For flow cytometry and cell sorting, cells were trypsinized, collected in culture medium, washed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies in PBS containing 2% serum for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed in PBS, incubated with phycoerythrin- or allophycocyanin-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at 4°C, washed in PBS, and analyzed on a FACSCalibur or sorted on a FACStar plus® (BD Biosciences). Rho Activity Assays—Cells were plated overnight to subconfluency before lysis in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mix (Sigma-Aldrich)), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. A 1% aliquot was removed for determination of total quantities of RhoA. Clarified lysates were then incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the Rho-binding domain of the Rho effector protein Rhotekin. Complexes were bound to glutathione-conjugated beads and washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. FN Matrix Assembly Assays—To visualize FN matrix assembly, cells were plated on FN-coated coverslips for 4 h and subsequently incubated for an additional 20 h in medium containing 10% FN-depleted serum supplemented with 10 μg/ml biotinylated FN. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin, and stained with streptavidin-Texas Red. Subsequently, coverslips were permeabilized in 0.4% Triton X-100 and stained with TOPRO-3. For biochemical analysis of FN matrix assembly cells were labeled with biotinylated FN as described above and lysed in DOC buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 2 mm iodoacetic acid, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were passed through a 23-gauge needle, and deoxycholate-insoluble material was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed once with DOC buffer, resolved in reduced sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Integrin Immunoprecipitations—Prior to immunoprecipitation some cells were stimulated with 3 mm H2O2 and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate for 20 min to maximize phosphorylation. Cells were lysed for 15 min at 4 °C in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich)). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Proteins were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with antibodies to β1 (K20) or β3 (SSA6) coupled to protein A-Sepharose. The beads were resolved in reduced sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Morphological Transformation by SrcYF Does Not Require β1 Integrins—Src activation causes a dramatic change in cellular morphology by interfering with adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, processes in which integrin signaling plays a critical role. To investigate the role of β1 integrins in Src-mediated morphological transformation, we expressed SrcYF in two independent β1-deficient cell lines. As described for Src activation in other cell types (9Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 16Yeatman T.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 470-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar), expression of SrcYF in GE11 and GD25 cells caused disruption of cell-cell contacts and cell scattering (Fig. 1A). Expression of SrcYF also caused a dramatic reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton: F-actin bundles and ruffles disappeared and, instead, actin clusters were formed that resemble podosomes (Fig. 1B). Initial adhesion (e.g. 15 min) of GE11 and GD25 cells to FN is weak (Fig. 2A), but at later time points (1 h) they do fully adhere and spread (Fig. 2B). Expression of SrcYF interfered with this spreading, causing a rounded or fusiform phenotype, which was maintained after overnight culture (Figs. 1B and 2B). These experiments show that all aspects of SrcYF-induced morphological transformation can occur in β1 null cells, arguing against a requirement for β1 integrins per se.FIGURE 2β3 integrin protects against SrcYF-induced loss of adhesion and spreading. A, graphs indicate the average percentage ± S.D. of adherent cells 15 min after plating from two independent FN adhesion assays performed in triplicate wells. Asterisks indicate significant difference between average values (t-test, p < 0.01). Expression of various constructs is shown at the bottom of the graph. B, phase contrast images of GE11 and GD25 cells expressing indicated constructs that were plated on an FN-coated surface for 1 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Different Aspects of SrcYF-mediated Morphological Transformation Can Be Separated; Distinct Roles for β1 and β3 Integrins—Expression of β1 in GE11 and GD25 cells led to a strong increase in cell adhesion to FN (∼70% of the cells attached at 15 min after plating) that was suppressed by SrcYF (Fig. 2A). At later times (e.g. 1 h after plating), GEβ1 and GDβ1 cells had all adhered regardless of the absence or presence of SrcYF, but in the presence of SrcYF cells remained rounded (Fig. 2B). In complete contrast, overexpression of β3 in the β1 null cells led to a similar increase in adhesion and spreading to FN as expression of β1 but this was only minimally affected by SrcYF (Fig. 2, A and B). Notably, after overnight culture SrcYFβ1-expressing cells retained a fusiform or even rounded shape whereas SrcYFβ3-expressing cells remained well spread (Fig. 4A). This indicates that SrcYF did not simply delay β1-integrin-mediated spreading but caused a permanent morphological alteration that was not seen in the context of αvβ3. Finally, expression of β1 in GESrcYFβ3 cells did not alter the well spread morphology of these cells, indicating that αvβ3-mediated protection against SrcYF-induced cell rounding was dominant (supplemental Fig. S1, A and B). We have reported that expression of β1 integrins in GE11 and GD25 cells stimulates Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility and FN matrix assembly, whereas overexpression of β3 in β1 null cells is unable to do so (24Danen E.H. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). We wondered whether higher levels of Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility could also explain the inhibition of cell spreading in the SrcYF-transformed cells expressing β1 integrins. However, in the presence of SrcYF, RhoA-GTP levels in β1-expressing cells were dramatically suppressed to levels that were comparable with those in cells lacking β1 (Fig. 3A). Moreover, FN matrix assembly, a process that requires Rho-mediated contractility, was strongly reduced upon introduction of SrcYF (Fig. 3, B and C). Subsequently, we investigated whether β1 and β3 integrins affected SrcYF-mediated podosome assembly. Despite the markedly different sensitivities of β1- and β3-mediated adhesion and spreading to suppression by SrcYF (Fig. 2), loss of F-actin stress fibers and conversion of focal adhesions into podosomes was seen in each case (Fig. 4A). Podosomes of SrcYFβ1 cells often consisted of F-actin dots that were tightly sealed together, whereas more dispersed, individual, small F-actin dots were present in SrcYFβ3 cells, which may be explained by increased cell spreading (see Fig. 4A, insets). The podosomes that were formed in each of the SrcYF-transformed cell types were dependent on SrcYF kinase activity, because treatment with the Src-selective kinase inhibitor PP2 led to their disassembly (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, these results demonstrate that (i) high levels of β3, but not β1, integrins protect SrcYF-transformed cells from rounding up and (ii) two typical aspects of SrcYF-induced morphological transformation, cell rounding and podosome formation, are distinct processes and are differently affected by the integrin expression profile. SrcYF-induced Podosomes Are Proteolytically Active Irrespective of the Integrin Type—Formation of podosomes is a morphological hallmark of Src transformation, and these adhesions are thought to be hotspots for invasion and proteolytic remodeling of the extracellular matrix (17Linder S. Aepfelbacher M. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 376-385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 18Yamaguchi H. Wyckoff J. Condeelis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 559-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the integrin expression profile affected the proteolytic activity of these podosomes. No matrix degradation was observed to be associated with focal contacts in GEβ1 and GEβ3 cells in the absence of SrcYF when plated on immobilized FITC-labeled FN (Fig. 5). By contrast, podosomes formed in GESrcYFβ1 and GESrcYFβ3 cells were both able to degrade FITC-FN. Proteolytic activity was often evident at sites outside cell borders, indicating that cells had moved along these sites (Fig. 5, arrowheads). Thus, podosomes in SrcYF-transformed cells are proteolytically active, irrespective of the integrin composition. Oncogenic and Morphological Transformations Are Separated by Distinct Integrin Domains—We have previously shown that αvβ3 strongly supports SrcYF-mediated tumorigenesis through an interaction between the β3 cytoplasmic domain and the Src homology 3 domain (22Huveneers S. van den Bout I. Sonneveld P. Sancho A. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2693-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We examined whether this was related to the capacity of αvβ3 to protect cells against SrcYF-induced rounding (Figs. 2 and 4). Therefore, we expressed a chimeric β1ex3in subunit, consisting of a β1 extracellular and transmembrane region fused to the cytoplasmic tail of β3, or an inverse β3ex1in integrin in GESrcYF cells (supplemental Fig. S1C). Using these chimeric integrins we demonstrated that the β3 cytoplasmic domain was required and sufficient for the stimulation of SrcYF-mediated tumor growth (Fig. 6C, left graph, and Ref. 22Huveneers S. van den Bout I. Sonneveld P. Sancho A. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2693-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In complete contrast, αvβ3-mediated protection against SrcYF-induced cell rounding required the β3 extracellular domain: β3ex1in failed to support tumor growth but effectively rescued short term cell adhesion and subsequent spreading, whereas the opposite was the case for a β1ex3in chimera (Fig. 6, A and C). Like adhesion and spreading, the appearance of podosomes was unaffected by the integrin cytoplasmic tail swap: podosomes in the presence of β1ex3in resembled those of β1-expressing cells and were often sealed together, whereas podosomes of β3ex1in-expressing cells were comparable with those expressing β3, consisting mainly of dispersed small F-actin dots (Fig. 6B). These results demonstrate that (i) high levels of αvβ3 support SrcYF-mediated tumor formation and protect against SrcYF-induced loss of adhesion and spreading through distinct mechanisms and (ii) SrcYF-mediated oncogenic and morphological transformation can be separated. Podosome Formation Requires SrcYF-mediated Phosphorylation of the β1 Cytoplasmic Tail to Suppress Cytoskeletal Contractility—Integrin cytoplasmic tails serve as direct phosphorylation substrates of v-Src, which impairs their adhesive function (19Sakai T. Jove R. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3808-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Datta A. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3943-3949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Analysis of immunoprecipitated integrin β subunits demonstrated that β1 and β3 can both be tyrosine-phosphorylated by SrcYF (Fig. 7A), although phosphorylation was very low compared with maximal levels reached with pervanadate (Fig. 7B). Using single tyrosine point mutants we have found that phosphorylation of either of the two tyrosines in the β3 cytoplasmic tail is not required for αvβ3-mediated support of tumor growth (22Huveneers S. van den Bout I. Sonneveld P. Sancho A. Sonnenberg A. Danen E.H. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2693-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We observed that these mutations also did not affect morphological transformation by SrcYF (data not shown). Moreover, expression of a non-phosphorylatable β3Y747F,Y759F (β3YYFF) subunit did not change SrcYF-mediated morphological transformation when compared with wild type β3: actin stress fibers were absent and podosomes were formed in the presence of SrcYF and β3YYFF (Fig. 7C). By contrast, in cells expressing β1, integrin phosphorylation was crucial for SrcYF-mediated morphological transformation. When a non-phosphorylatable β1Y783F,Y795F (β1YYFF) subunit was expressed in GESrcYF and GDSrcYF cells (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E), SrcYF-induced podosome formation was completely abolished (Fig. 7, D-F). Instead of podosomes that were formed in SrcYFβ1 cells, F-actin stress fibers and focal contacts were restored in SrcYFβ1YYFF cells and eventually these cells became considerably more spread. These results indicate that phosphorylation of β1, but not β3, cytoplasmic tails is important for SrcYF-mediated morphological transformation. Most likely, phosphorylation is required to suppress Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility that is promoted by β1, but not by β3, integrins and would interfere with podosome formation (Fig. 3). In summary (see Fig. 8), we show that (i) Src-mediated oncogenic and morphological transformations are distinct processes; (ii) podosome formation and cell rounding are independent aspects of Src-mediated morphological transformation (e.g. all cells expressing high levels of integrin subunits containing β3 extracellular domain contain podosomes but remain well spread); (iii) αvβ3 supports SrcYF-mediated tumor formation and protects against SrcYF-induced loss of adhesion and spreading through distinct mechanisms (e.g. experiments using β1ex3in and β3ex1in chimeras indicate that the β3 cytoplasmic domain supports Src-mediated tumor growth whereas the β3 extracellular domain protects against Src-induced cell rounding); and (iv) Src-induced podosome assembly in the presence of β1 requires phosphorylation of the integrin cytoplasmic domain to reduce cytoskeletal contractility (e.g. β1YYFF). In the absence of β1 integrins, β3 does not promote Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility (24Danen E.H. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) and podosomes can be formed without Src-mediated phosphorylation of integrin tails (e.g. β3YYFF). Disruption of cytoskeletal contractility is one of the key events during Src-induced morphological transformation that enables reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in order to assemble podosomes. Relaxation of the actin cytoskeleton requires inactivation of RhoA, and indeed expression of constitutively activated RhoA suppresses loss of stress fibers and podosome formation induced by v-Src (26Fincham V.J. Chudleigh A. Frame M.C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 947-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, complete inhibition of RhoA also perturbs podosomes, indicating that local RhoA activity might still be required (27Berdeaux R.L. Diaz B. Kim L. Martin G.S. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 317-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We find that SrcYF inhibits the ability of β1 integrins to support RhoA-mediated contractility. The kinase activity of SrcYF is required for podosome formation in SrcYFβ1- and SrcYFβ3-expressing cells, and SrcYF phosphorylates β1 and β3 cytoplasmic domains. However, phosphorylation of β1, but not β3, is important for SrcYF-mediated morphological transformation. In line with a previous report (28Sakai T. Zhang Q. Fassler R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 527-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), mutation of the tyrosines in the β1 cytoplasmic tail restored focal adhesions and cell spreading. Our findings suggest that this is due to restored cytoskeletal contractility that prevents the transformation from focal contacts to podosomes in the presence of SrcYF. Indeed, overexpression of αvβ3 fails to promote Rho-mediated cytoskeletal contractility in β1-null cells (24Danen E.H. Sonneveld P. Brakebusch C. Fassler R. Sonnenberg A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 1071-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), explaining why corresponding mutations in the β3 subunit do not affect Src-mediated morphological transformation. Notably, in osteosarcoma cells phosphorylation of β3 by v-Src reduces the binding strength of αvβ3 to FN (21Datta A. Huber F. Boettiger D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3943-3949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In our studies, αvβ3-mediated adhesion to FN was not affected by the expression of SrcYF, which may be related to differences between v-Src (which contains multiple additional mutations) and SrcYF (which may closely resemble c-Src in human cancer cells where its interaction with overexpressed receptor tyrosine kinases or mutations in the C terminus can lead to enhanced priming) or to the moderate SrcYF expression and integrin phosphorylation levels that we reach in GE11 and GD25 cells. Nevertheless, these levels are sufficient to cause all the aspects of morphological transformation and lead to rounding of β1-expressing cells. Our study dissociates SrcYF-mediated oncogenic from morphological transformation and shows that different aspects of morphological transformation (e.g. podosome formation and cell rounding) involve separable, independent pathways. These findings are corroborated by studies in which mitogenic activity, morphological alterations, and the anchorage independence of cells expressing mutants of v-Src were compared. It was shown that the amino-terminal domain of v-Src is important for determining cell morphology, whereas the kinase domain is essential for all three parameters (29Jove R. Mayer B.J. Iba H. Laugier D. Poirier F. Calothy G. Hanafusa T. Hanafusa H. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 840-848Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also, when expressed at very low levels in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, v-Src elicited disruption of zonula adherences, which was dissociable from oncogenic transformation, as determined by anchorage-independent growth capacity and proliferation (30Warren S.L. Nelson W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1326-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Attempts to transform c-Myc-deficient fibroblasts with v-Src resulted in morphological transformation but failed to induce DNA synthesis and proliferation (31Prathapam T. Tegen S. Oskarsson T. Trumpp A. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All together, these studies show that signaling downstream of Src can occur through multiple independent pathways. Our current work indicates that the integrin expression profile differentially modulates all these aspects of Src transformation. In human cancer increased expression and activity of c-Src contributes to tumor development through stimulation of mitogenic signaling pathways in which c-Src normally plays a regulatory role (10Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2175) Google Scholar, 32Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). In addition, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, cell-cell, and cell-matrix adhesions upon Src activation may contribute to tumor invasion and metastasis (4Irby R.B. Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar, 9Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Interestingly, changes in the expression profile of integrins often occur with tumor formation and during later steps of tumor progression. Increased expression levels of αvβ3 are associated with growth and progression of various cancers (33Mizejewski G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 222: 124-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For example, high levels of αvβ3 promote the conversion from radial to vertical growth phase in human melanoma (34Albelda S.M.

Yeatman T.J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5636-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Our findings suggest that such changes in integrin expression can have a dramatic impact on Src-mediated effects on growth and/or invasion of tumors. Cooperation between integrin αvβ3 and c-Src may be important for tumor growth, whereas shifts in the relative expression of β1 and β3 integrins might be important to control tumor cell adhesion and spreading during cancer progression.

https://openalex.org/W2033127090,"Interleukin (IL)-5 exerts hematopoietic functions through binding to the IL-5 receptor subunits, alpha and betac. Specific assembly steps of full-length subunits as they occur in cell membranes, ultimately leading to receptor activation, are not well understood. We tracked the oligomerization of IL-5 receptor subunits using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging. Full-length IL-5Ralpha and betac were expressed in Phoenix cells as chimeric proteins fused to enhanced cyan or yellow fluorescent protein (CFP or YFP, respectively). A time- and dose-dependent increase in FRET signal between IL-5Ralpha-CFP and betac-YFP was observed in response to IL-5, indicative of heteromeric receptor alpha-betac subunit interaction. This response was inhibited by AF17121, a peptide antagonist of IL-5Ralpha. Substantial FRET signals with betac-CFP and betac-YFP co-expressed in the absence of IL-5Ralpha demonstrated that betac subunits exist as preformed homo-oligomers. IL-5 had no effect on this betac-alone FRET signal. Interestingly, the addition of IL-5 to cells co-expressing betac-CFP, betac-YFP, and nontagged IL-5Ralpha led to further increase in FRET efficiency. Observation of preformed betac oligomers fits with the view that this form can lead to rapid cellular responses upon IL-5 stimulation. The IL-5-induced effects on betac assembly in the presence of nontagged IL-5Ralpha provide direct evidence that IL-5 can cause higher order rearrangements of betac homo-oligomers. These results suggest that IL-5 and perhaps other betac cytokines (IL-3 and granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor) trigger cellular responses by the sequential binding of cytokine ligand to the specificity receptor (subunit alpha), followed by binding of the ligand-subunit alpha complex to, and consequent rearrangement of, a ground state form of betac oligomers."
https://openalex.org/W1992444203,"As interleukin-2 (IL2) is central to the clonal expansion of antigen-selected T cells, we investigated the relationship between IL2 and the negative regulatory transcription factor FOXP3. We found IL2 to be responsible for T cell antigen receptor (TCR)-activated FOXP3 expression by both CD4+ and CD8+ human T cells, and as anticipated, FOXP3 expression restricted TCR-stimulated IL2 expression. However, no evidence could be found that FOXP3+ cells actively suppress IL2 expression by FOXP3- cells. These data are consistent with an IL2/FOXP3-dependent negative feedback loop that normally regulates the T cell immune response. It follows that a defect in this negative feedback loop as a result of a deficiency of either IL2 or FOXP3 will lead to a hyperproliferative autoimmune syndrome, without the necessity of invoking an active suppressive function for FOXP3+ T cells."

Two S6K1 isoforms (accession no. NM003161, αI and αII isoforms) are produced from a single gene by alternative mRNA splicing and the use of an alternative translational start site (6Grove J.R. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Coffer P.J. Price D.J. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5541-5550Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The 525-residue αI isoform contains an N-terminal 23 residue segment that encodes a polybasic nuclear localization motif, whereas the cytoplasmic αII isoform starts at a Met residue equivalent to Met-24 in the αI isoform, and the sequences of both isoforms are identical thereafter.S6K1 is a member of the AGC subfamily of serine-threonine protein kinases in which amino acid sequences are conserved in a segment of the catalytic kinase domain known as the activation loop or T-loop, as well as in a segment near the C terminus of the kinase domain known as the hydrophobic motif (7Peterson R.T. Schreiber S.L. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R521-R524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Similar to other AGC kinase family members, catalytic activation of S6K1 minimally requires dual phosphorylation of a critical residue in both the T-loop and hydrophobic motif. For the full-length S6K1αI isoform these residues correspond to Thr-252 and Thr-412, respectively (8Alessi D. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.-P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 8: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (512) Google Scholar), whereas in the S6K1αII isoform the identical residues correspond to Thr-229 and Thr-389 (9Pullen N. Dennis P.B. Andjelkovic M. Dufner A. Kozma S.C. Hemmings B.A. Thomas G. Science. 1998; 279: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). With combined knowledge from available amino acid sequence alignments and x-ray structures, molecular modeling and biochemical testing now provide strong evidence for a common AGC kinase activation mechanism in which the C-terminal phosphorylated hydrophobic motif interacts with a phosphate binding pocket located in the small N-lobe of the kinase (10Frödin M. Antal T.L. Dümmler B.A. Jensen C.J. Deak M. Gammeltoft S. Biondi R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This intramolecular interaction acts synergistically with T-loop phosphorylation to stabilize the active conformation, whereby a critical Glu residue in the αC-helix forms an ion pair with the catalytic Lys that functions to position the terminal phosphate of ATP for phosphotransfer in the kinase reaction.In recognizing the synergistic role of AGC kinase dual site phosphorylation, neither an x-ray three-dimensional structure nor a kinetic mechanism has been reported for any S6K1 isoform or domain construct. This derives largely from the inability to generate fully Thr-229 phosphorylated and activated S6K1. In previous work, we demonstrated by (i) Western analysis, (ii) electrospray ionization-time-of-flight, (iii) Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, and (iv) kinetic assays that the N-terminal His6 affinity-tagged catalytic kinase domain construct of the αII isoform of S6K1 (His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)-T389E; residues 1–398) could be generated in its fully Thr-229 phosphorylated most highly active form (250 nmol/min/mg) by baculovirus-mediated expression and purification from Sf9 insect cells that are co-infected with recombinant phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1, the upstream Thr-229 kinase (11Keshwani M.M. Ross D.B. Ragan T.J. Harris T.K. Prot. Express. Purif. 2007; 58: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).Herein, we report that fully activated His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)-T389E catalyzes peptide phosphorylation by a Steady-State Ordered Bi Bi mechanism, whereby high affinity ATP binding precedes low affinity peptide binding. Rapid chemical phosphorylation and release of phosphopeptide is followed by steady-state rate-limiting steps involving release of ADP. Pre-steady-state kinetic and direct binding experiments showed osmotic pressure to correspondingly weaken nucleotide affinity and increase the dissociation rate, indicating a less hydrated conformational form of the free enzyme.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—His6-S6K1αII-T389E was generated in its fully Thr-229 phosphorylated and activated form by baculovirus-mediated expression and purification from Sf9 insect cells that were co-infected with recombinant baculovirus expressing the catalytic domain of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (11Keshwani M.M. Ross D.B. Ragan T.J. Harris T.K. Prot. Express. Purif. 2007; 58: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Minor amounts of high molecular weight protein impurities observed with His6 affinity-purified His6-S6K1αII-T389E were removed by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay Kit with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Fmoc-l-arginine, Fmoc-l-leucine, Fmoc-l-alanine, Fmoc-l-serine, and Wang resin were from Advanced Chemtech (Louisville, KY). N-α-Fmoc-O-benzyl-l-phosphoserine (Fmoc-Ser[PO(OBzl)-OH]-OH) was from AnaSpec, Inc. (San Jose, CA). [γ-32P]ATP, [8-14C]ATP, and [8-14C]ADP were from MP Biomedical (Irvine, CA). All other chemicals, salts, and buffers were from Sigma.Peptide Synthesis—The S6K/RSK model peptide substrate (Tide, RRRLSSLRA) and phosphorylated peptide product (pTide, RRRLSpSLRA) were prepared by the solid-phase methodology on Wang resin (1.3 mmol/g). Briefly, coupling reactions were carried out with a 3-fold excess of Fmoc amino acids with diisopropylcarbodiimide/1-hydroxybenzotriazole as activating agent in dimethylformamide. Intermediate deprotection was achieved with 20% (v/v) piperidine in dimethylformamide for 30 min. After an average coupling period of 1 h, the extent of acylation was monitored by the standard ninhydrin test. In the event of incomplete coupling, the coupling procedure was repeated. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin was performed with trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of 8% anisole, 2% dimethyl sulfide, 2% p-cresol, and 2% thiocresol at 0 °C for 2 h, which also effectively removed the monobenzyl protecting group of phosphoserine. After removal of trifluoroacetic acid under a stream of nitrogen followed by vacuum, crude peptide was (i) precipitated with diethyl ether, (ii) filter washed with water and diethyl ether, (iii) extracted with 50% (v/v) aqueous acetic acid, and (iv) lyophilized. Crude peptide was purified by semipreparative reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Vydac 219TP1010 column (diphenyl, 10 μm, 10-mm inner diameter × 250 mm) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile as the eluant system. Purified Tide (≥95%) and pTide (≥95%) were confirmed by analytical reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (Vydac 219TP54, diphenyl, 5 μm, 4.6-mm inner diameter × 150 mm) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Two-substrate Steady-state Kinetic Assays—Steady-state kinetic assays were carried out for His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)-T389E-catalyzed phosphorylation of the S6K/RSK model peptide substrate (Tide, RRRLSSLRA). The residue of the Tide substrate that undergoes phosphorylation is underlined. The 100-μl Tide phosphorylation reactions were performed at 25 °C in 40 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7, containing 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. Initial velocities were measured for varying Tide concentrations (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 μm) at different fixed concentrations of [γ-32P]ATP (∼500–1000 cpm/pmol, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 μm). Data collection in this manner provided all information necessary to construct companion reciprocal plots for the two varied substrates. The assays were initiated by addition of 10–30 nm kinase.For all kinase assays, 20-μl aliquots were removed at three different times (ranging from 5 to 15 min) and mixed with 20 μl of 75 mm phosphoric acid and applied to P81 phosphocellulose paper (2 × 2 cm). After 30 s, the papers were washed (3×) in 1 liter of fresh 75 mm phosphoric acid for 10 min, then rinsed with 50 ml of acetone, and placed in the hood (≤5 min) to dry. The specific radioactivity of 32P-radiolabeled Tide (SATide, cpm/pmol) was determined from radioactivity detected by scintillation counting of the known amount of total Tide that was applied to the P81 paper; the micromolar amount of phosphorylated Tide product formed at each time point was determined by reference to the specific radioactivity of [γ-32P]ATP (SAATP, ∼500–1000 cpm/pmol) and the volume of the aliquot removed for quenching (20 μl). Initial velocities (v, μm s–1) were measured under conditions where total product formation represented ≥10% of the initial concentration of the limiting substrate. To better facilitate kinetic comparisons between steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic results, initial velocities were normalized to enzyme concentration to yield apparent first order rate constants, k (s–1) = v/[Etot].Control assays were carried out in which either the enzyme or Tide were omitted; these values were always ≤5% of the activity measured in the presence of both the lower- and upper-bound concentrations of these reagents (0.5 and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP; 10 and 30 nm enzyme). Control assays containing the enzyme and only the [γ-32P]ATP substrate were further analyzed to measure ATPase activity. The amount of [32P]inorganic phosphate released from [γ-32P]ATP was determined by addition of 50 μl of the reaction mixture to 100 μl of a quench solution containing a 21% suspension of acid-washed (HCl) activated charcoal in 75 mm phosphoric acid. The quenched solution was mixed and placed on ice for 5 min, which provided for effective removal of the [γ-32P]ATP nucleotide from solution by the charcoal. The charcoal with bound [γ-32P]ATP was pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min, and a 60-μl aliquot of the supernatant was analyzed for [32P]inorganic phosphate. The 32P radioactivity in the supernatant was always ≤5% of the radioactivity measured in the absence of enzyme, indicating that the ATPase activity of His6-S6K1(ΔAID)-T389E is significantly lower than activity to the Tide substrate.Pre-steady-state Kinetic Assays—Pre-steady-state kinetic assays were carried out for His6-S6K1(ΔAID)-T389E-catalyzed phosphorylation of Tide using a KinTek Corp. (Austin, TX) Model RQF-3 rapid-quench-flow apparatus thermostatted at 25 °C. Reaction buffer refers to 40 mm MOPS buffer, pH 7, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm sodium vanadate. The left and right drive syringes in the rapid quench flow apparatus were filled with reaction buffer, and the middle (quench) syringe was filled with 75% acetic acid. One sample loop was loaded with 15 μl of reaction buffer containing designated amounts of Tide, [γ-32P]ATP, and ADP; the other sample loop contained 15 μl of His6-S6K1(ΔAID)-T389E enzyme in reaction buffer. The phosphorylation reaction was initiated by mixing the contents of the sample loops and acid quenched after varying reaction times t (0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 3.0 s). For each time point, two 20-μl aliquots of each quenched reaction solution were individually applied to P81 phosphocellulose paper (2 × 2 cm), and the amount of Tide phosphorylation was quantified as described for the steady-state kinetic assays. The time courses were performed in triplicate, and the data points represent averaged values.Three companion sets of pre-steady state kinetic experiments were carried out in which 2 μm enzyme (concentration after mixing) was reacted with the following final concentrations of other reactants: (i) [Tide] = 200 μm and [ATP] = 5, 10, 20, 50, and 200 μm; (ii) [ATP] = 200 μm and [Tide] = 5, 10, 20, 50, and 200 μm; and (iii) [ATP] = [Tide] = 200 μm and [ADP] = 0, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 μm. Data collection in this manner permitted global kinetic analysis to obtain exact or limiting fitted values of the microscopic rate constants in the Ordered Bi Bi mechanism (Scheme 1). Control assays were carried out in which the Tide substrate was omitted for enzyme in the presence of 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP. The amount of 32P radioactivity detected on the filter paper was always ≤5% of the measured radioactivity in the presence of Tide, indicating that purified active His6-S6K1(ΔAID)-T389E catalyzes little or no nonspecific autophosphorylation during reaction times ≤3 s. In addition, the amount of 32P radioactivity hydrolyzed from [γ-32P]ATP during this time period was shown to be negligible by the charcoal-filtration assay.Catalytic Trapping Assays—Catalytic trapping assays were carried out at 25 °C using the rapid-quench-flow apparatus exactly as described for pre-steady-state assays except that enzyme was preincubated with ADP prior to mixing with ATP and Tide substrates. The final concentrations after mixing were 2 μm active His6-S6K1(ΔAID)-T389E and 200 μm each of ADP, ATP, and Tide in reaction buffer either in the absence or presence of 5% (w/v) polyethylene glycol with an average molecular weight of 8000 (PEG-8000).Nucleotide Binding Assays—Nucleotide binding to His6-S6K1(ΔAID)-T389E was measured using a filter binding assay, whereby 0.5 μm enzyme was preincubated at 25 °C in 70 μl of phosphorylation reaction buffer, either in the absence or presence of 5% (w/v) PEG-8000, containing varying concentrations of either [8-14C]ATP (∼500 cpm/pmol, and 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 μm) or [8-14C]ADP (∼500 cpm/pmol, and 1.5, 2.5, 4, 7.5, 17.5, 37.5, and 62.5 μm). After 15 min, three separate 20-μl aliquots were removed and applied to three separate wells of a Bio-Rad Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus with a fitted P81 phosphocellulose paper under vacuum. Radiolabeled nucleotide bound to the enzyme was retained by the P81 paper, whereas unbound nucleotide was collected in a vacuum flask. The P81 paper was removed from the apparatus and cut into individual sections. The amount of 14C background radiation was also determined for each nucleotide concentration by control assays carried out in which the enzyme was omitted. The amount of 14C background radiation (≤10%) was subtracted from the total radioactivity measured in the presence of the enzyme. The corrected radioactivity was used to calculate the micromolar amount of bound nucleotide, [A]bound, according to the specific radioactivity of the nucleotide and the volume of the aliquot applied to the paper. Because titrated nucleotide exceeded enzyme concentration, the total nucleotide concentration, [A]total, approximated its free concentration, [A]free, for each measurement. Data points represent averaged values from triple measurements.Data Analysis—Steady-state kinetic data were plotted and fitted using the GraFit 4.0 software (Erithacus Software, UK). The kinetic formulation of an Ordered Bi Bi system, taking into account an irreversible chemical phosphorylation step in the ternary complex (Scheme 1), is fully described in the supplemental material. Initial rates determined in the two-substrate steady-state kinetic studies were globally fitted to Equation S8 (supplemental material), which yielded values for kcat, KmATP, KmTide, and KdATP. Secondary plots of kcat(app) determined from direct Michaelis-Menten fits of (i) k versus [ATP] and (ii) k versus [Tide] at different fixed concentrations of the other substrate were further analyzed by Equations S11 and S15, respectively, which confirmed the fitted values for kcat, KmATP, and KmTide.Initial rates determined in steady-state kinetic ADP and pTide inhibition studies were globally fitted to Equations S23 and S31, respectively, to yield values for kcat, KmATP, and the inhibition constant for the designated product (either KiADP or Kip Tide). The secondary plot of Km(app)ATP determined from direct Michaelis-Menten fits of k versus [ATP] at different fixed [ADP] was further analyzed by Equation S25, which confirmed the fitted values for KmATP and KiADP; secondary plots of kcat(app) and Km(app)ATP determined from direct fits of k versus [ATP] at different fixed [pTide] were analyzed by Equations S32 and S33, respectively, which confirmed the fitted values for kcat, KmATP and Kip Tide.Pre-steady-state kinetic data were analyzed using the DynaFit 3.28 software (BioKin, Ltd., Pullman, WA) (12Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). The time dependence of phosphopeptide product formation as a function of [ATP], [Tide], and [ADP] was globally fitted to obtain the microscopic rate constants depicted in Scheme 1. As demonstrated in the supplemental material, Equations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 relate values of the microscopic rate constants in Scheme 1 with the kinetic constants determined in steady-state kinetic studies. kcat=k+3k+4k+5k+3k+4+k+3k+5+k+4k+5Eq. 1 kmATP=k+3k+4k+5k+1(k+3k+4+k+3k+5+k+4k+5)Eq. 2 kdATP=k-1k+1Eq. 3 kmTide=k+4k+5(k-2+k+3)k+2(k+3k+4+k+3k+5+k+4k+5)Eq. 4 kiADP=k+5k-5Eq. 5 kipTide=k+3k+4+k+3k+5+k+4k+5k+3k-4Eq. 6 With regard to ADP inhibtion, KiADP represents the true dissociation constant, KdADP. For pTide inhibition, Kip Tide closely approximates the true dissociation constant of phosphopeptide product, Kdp Tide=k+4/k−4 under conditions where both k+3 and k+4 exceed k+5.The nucleotide dissociation constants (KdATP and KdADP) and binding capacity (C) were obtained from direct fittings of plots of concentrations of bound nucleotide, [A]bound, versus concentrations of free nucleotide, [A]free, to Equation 7. [A]bound=C[A]freekd+[A]freeEq. 7 RESULTSTwo-substrate Steady-state Kinetics—Fig. 1 shows double reciprocal plots of all steady-state kinetic data for titration of active His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)-T389E with varying concentrations of one substrate at different fixed concentrations of the other substrate. Due to the results obtained in product inhibition studies (see below), analysis of these data was best approximated and described for a Steady-State Ordered Bi Bi system, whereby binding of ATP precedes binding of peptide substrate (Scheme 1). Global fitting of the data to Equation S8 yielded values of kcat = 0.192 ± 0.002 s–1, KmATP=5.1±0.2μM, KmTide=4.1±0.1μM, and KdATP=5.0±0.4μM.FIGURE 1Two-substrate steady-state kinetics.

In both reciprocal plots, the concentration of one substrate was varied at seven different concentrations of the fixed substrate (1 μm (•), 2 μm (○), 3 μm (▪), 5 μm (□), 10 μm (▴), 25 μm (▵), and 50 μm (▾)). The solid lines were generated using the kinetic constants determined from the global fit of the data to Equation S8, and the reciprocal forms of this equation were generated with either ATP (Equation S13) or Tide (Equation S17) as the varied substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To better illustrate this analysis, these data are further given in direct and secondary plots, where both the global fit to Equation S8 and individual direct fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation are displayed and tabulated (supplemental Fig. S1 and Tables S1 and S2).Product Inhibition Steady-state Kinetics—The pattern of intersecting lines shown in two-substrate steady-state kinetics (Fig. 1) provided little evidence toward the kinetic mechanism of peptide phosphorylation other than ruling out both (i) Ping-Pong and (ii) Rapid Equilibrium Ordered Bi Bi systems. For these mechanisms, respectively, either parallel lines are observed or lines intersect on the y-axis for the second binding substrate. Discrimination between other possible mechanisms (e.g. Steady-State Ordered, Steady-State Random, or (Partial) Rapid Equilibrium Random Bi Bi systems) may be achieved by comparing the effects of product inhibitors in double reciprocal plots constructed for varying one substrate concentration at a fixed concentration of the other substrate.Fig. 2 shows double reciprocal plots of both ADP and pTide product inhibition steady-state kinetic data for titration of active His6-S6K1αII(ΔAID)-T389E, whereby [ATP] was varied using a fixed [Tide] (200 μm) far exceeding KmTide (4.1 μm). Fig. 2A shows the ADP product to be competitive with respect to the varied ATP substrate, and global fitting of the data to Equation S23 yielded very close approximations of the true values of kcat = 0.190 ± 0.003 s–1, KmATP=5.2±0.4μM, and the inhibition constant KiADP=5.5±0.5μM. In this case, the measured KiADP equates with the true dissociation constant for ADP product release, KdADP (Scheme 1 and Equation 5).FIGURE 2Product inhibition steady-state kinetics. Double reciprocal plots of 1/k versus 1/[ATP] performed at 25 °C. A, ADP product inhibition was measured using (i) varying [ATP] = 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, and 100 μm, (ii) saturating fixed [Tide] = 200 μm, and (iii) [ADP] = 0 μm (•), 5 μm (○), 10 μm (▴), 15 μm (▵), and 20 μm (▾). Solid lines were generated using the kinetic constants determined from the global fit of the data to Equation S23 and its reciprocal Equation S26. B, pTide product inhibition was measured using (i) varying [ATP] = 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 μm, (ii) saturating fixed [Tide] = 200 μm, and (iii) [pTide] = 0 μm (•), 100 μm (○), 200 μm (▴), 300 μm (▵), and 400 μm (▾).

In this case, the measured Kip Tide is defined by Equation 6. The combined observation that ADP and pTide behave as competitive and uncompetitive inhibitors, respectively, with respect to the varied ATP substrate under saturating [Tide] conditions clearly indicates a Steady-State Ordered Bi Bi system, whereby binding of ATP precedes binding of peptide substrate (Scheme 1).To better illustrate this analysis, the ADP and pTide inhibition data are further given in direct and secondary plots, where both the global fits to Equations S23 and S31 and individual direct fits to the Michaelis-Menten equation are displayed and tabulated (supplemental Fig. S2 and Tables S1 and S3).

https://openalex.org/W1992410485,"Previous studies showed that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6) is important for platelet function; however, little is known about which signaling events regulate this small GTP-binding protein. Arf6-GTP was monitored in platelets stimulated with a number of agonists (TRAP, thrombin, convulxin, collagen, PMA, thapsigargin, or A23187) and all led to a time-dependent decrease in Arf6-GTP. ADP and U46619 were without effect. Using inhibitors, it was shown that the decrease of Arf6-GTP is a direct consequence of known signaling cascades. Upon stimulation via PAR receptors, Arf6-GTP loss could be blocked by treatment with U-73122, BAPTA/AM, Ro-31-8220, or Gö6976, indicating requirements for phospholipase C, calcium, and protein kinase C (PKC) alpha/beta, respectively. The Arf6-GTP decrease in convulxin-stimulated platelets showed similar requirements and was also sensitive to piceatannol, wortmannin, and LY294002, indicating additional requirements for Syk and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The convulxin-induced decrease was sensitive to both PKCalpha/beta and delta inhibitors. Outside-in signaling, potentially via integrin engagement, caused a second wave of signaling that affected Arf6. Inclusion of RGDS peptides or EGTA, during activation, led to a biphasic response; Arf6-GTP levels partially recovered upon continued incubation. A similar response was seen in beta3 integrin-null platelets. These data show that Arf6-GTP decreases in response to known signaling pathways associated with PAR and GPVI. They further reveal a second, aggregation-dependent, process that dampens Arf6-GTP recovery. This study demonstrates that the nucleotide state of Arf6 in platelets is regulated during the initial phases of activation and during the later stages of aggregation."
https://openalex.org/W2079881052,"The ubiquitously expressed TFII-I family of multifunctional transcription factors is involved in gene regulation as well as signaling. Despite the fact that they share significant sequence homology, these factors exhibit varied and distinct functions. The lack of knowledge about its binding sites and physiological target genes makes it more difficult to assign a definitive function for the TFII-I-related protein, BEN. We set out to determine its optimal binding site with the notion of predicting its physiological target genes. Here we report the identification of an optimal binding sequence for BEN by SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) and confirm the relevance of this sequence by functional assays. We further performed a data base search to assign genes that have this consensus site(s) and validate several candidate genes by quantitative PCR upon stable silencing of BEN and by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay upon stable expression of BEN. Given that haploinsufficiency in BEN is causative to Williams-Beuren syndrome, these results may further lead to the identification of a set of physiologically relevant target genes for BEN and may help identify molecular determinants of Williams-Beuren syndrome."

The specific functions and sites of action of p24 proteins are still unknown. Here we identified a human homolog of the yeast p24 family of proteins, named ERS25 (endoplasmic reticulum stress-response protein 25), and investigated its role in stress response. ERS25 is predicted to have an ER localization signal peptide, a GOLD (Golgi dynamics) domain, which is found in several eukaryotic Golgi and lipid-trafficking proteins, a coiled-coil region, and a transmembrane domain. We demonstrate that ERS25 is localized to the ER and is induced by ER-specific stress, heat shock, and oxidative stress. The selective induction of ERS25 by brefeldin A, but not tunicamycin, implicates the involvement of ERS25 in protein trafficking between the ER and the Golgi. Small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of ERS25 results in a significant decrease in apoptosis as well as a reduction of reactive oxygen species induced by oxidative stress. Moreover, ERS25 depletion results in a significant increase in the levels of the ER chaperone HSP70 in response to heat-shock stress through increased levels of HSF-1. We also found that inhibition of ERS25 induction in response to heat shock enhanced the binding of HSP70 to Apaf-1, which is likely to interfere in stress-mediated apoptosis.

Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: R11Google Scholar). In yeast, p24 proteins are synthesized in the ER and packaged into vesicles that bud off from the ER in a GTP-dependent process (2Bannykh S.I.

It has also been hypothesized that p24 proteins have a role in quality control to prevent misfolded proteins from being loaded into vesicles from the ER (11Wen C. Greenwald I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 12Carney G.E. Bowen N.J. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 271-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of stress stimuli, including heat shock, UV light, ionizing radiation, and oxidative stress, cause cells to accumulate a highly conserved set of molecules called heat-shock proteins (HSPs) (13Morimoto R.I. Sarge K.D. Abravaya K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21987-21990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Samali A. Orrenius S. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 228-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Heat-shock and reactive oxygen species can both result in the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins within the cytosol, which is termed the unfolding protein response. A similar, and sometimes overlapping, stress response, known as ER stress, results from the buildup of damaged and misfolded proteins within the ER, resulting in an overload the ER-folding machinery (15Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 16Sitia R. Braakman I. Nature. 2003; 426: 891-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 17Stavridi E.S.

The various HSPs, including HSP70, act to bind these proteins and facilitate their repair or degradation within the cytosol. HSPs are highly conserved from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and most cells induce HSPs of ∼25, 70, 90, and 110 kDa (19Landry J. Bernier D. Chretien P. Nicole L.M. Tanguay R.M. Marceau N. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2457-2461PubMed Google Scholar, 20Georgopoulos C. Welch W.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 601-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar, 21Huang L. Mivechi N.F. Moskophidis D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8575-8591Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Among these proteins, the 70-kDa HSP (HSP70) is the most highly induced and conserved from Escherichia coli to humans (22Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), with 95% amino acid sequence homology between human and mouse. Although the basal expression of HSP70 is very low, the induction upon heat shock is rapid and important for survival as mice deficient in HSP70 show genomic instability and enhanced radiosensitivity (22Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). In addition, down-regulation or disruption of HSP70 expression results in apoptosis (23Wei Y.Q. Zhao X. Kariya Y. Teshigawara K. Uchida A. Cancer Immunol.

Cotter T.G. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 163-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Several observations that the level of thermotolerance acquired by a cell is quantitatively related to the absolute levels of HSPs, particularly HSP70, suggest that HSPs play a protective role in cell survival (19Landry J. Bernier D. Chretien P. Nicole L.M. Tanguay R.M. Marceau N. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2457-2461PubMed Google Scholar, 29Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recently a direct link between HSP70 and apoptosis was made when it was discovered that HSP70 inhibits the activation of caspase 9 by the Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activating factor) apoptosome (31Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 32Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Thus, a clear role exists for HSP70 in cell survival upon heat-shock stress. In this study, we present the first cellular characterization of the first ER-localized human homolog of the p24 family of proteins and identify ERS25 as a stress response gene. Human ERS25 encodes for a polypeptide of 227 amino acids with a molecular mass of 25 kDa, which belongs to the Emp24/gp25L/p24 family of proteins with molecular mass between 23 and 27 kDa. We show that this protein localizes to the ER membrane and is induced by several forms of stress that induce accumulation of unfolded and misfolded proteins. Ablation of ERS25 results in decreased sensitivity to oxidative stress and an increase in HSP70 expression upon heat shock as well as enhanced binding between induced HSP70 and Apaf-1. These results demonstrate that ERS25 is a novel protein of the p24 family of proteins involved in ER stress response and is an important component of heat-shock regulation, representing a novel link between p24 family proteins and ER-stress mediated cell death pathway. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Heat-shock Treatment—NIH3T3 and U2OS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with a pBabe-U6 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), stable cells were selected for, and the clones were maintained in 1 μg/ml puromycin. For heat-shock treatment or chemical treatment, cells were plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells in a p100 plate, and 24 h later, the cells were placed at 42 °C, 5% CO2 as indicated. Chemicals used for inducing stress were purchased from Sigma, including tunicamycin, brefeldin A, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). shRNA Experiments—Short hairpin RNA oligonucleotides against mouse ERS25 were ordered from Dharmacon, and the following sequence was determined to be the most effective and used in all experiments: 5′-AAGGA GCAGG ATTAT CAG-3′. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with either pBabe-U6 plasmid expressing shRNA targeting ERS25 or empty vector as a control. Protein Analysis—Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1× Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture). An equal amount of total cellular proteins per sample was run on a SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Invitrogen). Antibodies used for Western blotting were: anti-Apaf-1 (BD Biosciences), anti-β-actin (AC-15, Sigma), anti-calnexin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-ERS25 (Imgenex), anti-HSP70 (StressGen), anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-2 (Calbiochem), and anti-α-tubulin (Sigma). For immunoprecipitation, CHAPS buffer was used to lyse the cells and protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) were used for immobilization. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was extracted using the PureLink Micro-to-Midi total RNA purification system with homogenizers (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Samples were quantified and denatured, and equal amounts were electrophoresed through 1% agarose gel by the formaldehyde denaturation method. RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane (Bio-Rad), UV-cross-linked (Stratagene), and then baked at 80 °C for 1 h. Hybridization was performed with 32P-labeled probes prepared by the random prime DNA labeling method (Invitrogen). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, hypotonic buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture) added directly to the plates and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were collected, and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 was added for 1 min. A 1-ml syringe with 25-gauge needle was used for disrupting cells. Cytosolic proteins were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min. The pellet was the washed with hypotonic buffer, and high salt buffer (hypotonic buffer supplemented with 20% glycerol and 420 mm NaCl) was added to extract nuclear proteins by rocking overnight at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was taken for nuclear extract, and the pellet was dissolved in lysis buffer to collect the membrane fraction. Immunostaining—Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated chamber slides (BD Biosciences) and attached for 24 h before heat-shock treatment. Cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 20 min before permeabilization in 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies (1:500). After washing three times with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100, the cells were incubated with secondary antibodies (1:500) for 1.5 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100 and stained for 20 min with the nuclear dye TO-PRO3 iodide (1:2000, Invitrogen). Slides were sealed with coverslips, and images were collected on a Leica TCS4D confocal laser-scanning microscope. Images were processed using Adobe PhotoShop software. Antibodies used for immunostaining were: anti-ERS25/HNLF (Imgenex) and calnexin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luciferase Assay—A reporter plasmid containing the putative HSP70 recognition sequence in the promoter was transfected into NIH3T3 cells. The HSP70-pr-Luciferase plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. Morimoto (Northwestern University). pRL-TK (Renilla plasmid) was also co-transfected for normalizing the luciferase signal. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the assay was performed using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega), after a 4-h incubation at 37 or 42 °C. Cell Death Assays—Cell death was measured using a cell death detection ELISA (Roche Applied Science) and trypan blue exclusion. Cells used for the ELISA were analyzed according to the manufacturer's protocol to measure the amount of DNA fragmentation. Trypan blue exclusion was performed on cells harvested and resuspended in medium and mixed 1:1 with 0.4% trypan blue. The percentage of cell survival was determined from the number of cells that stain blue versus the total cell count. Propidium Iodide Staining and Flow Cytometry—Cells were harvested and fixed with 70% ethanol while gently vortexing. Cells were stored at 4 °C up to 1 week prior to analysis. Prior to analysis, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated in PBS containing 500 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C followed by a 15-min room temperature incubation with 25 μg of propidium iodide. Cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences), and the data were analyzed using FlowJo 6.3.4 (Tree Star Inc.). Detection of Intracellular ROS—Cells were treated with various concentrations of H2O2 for 10 min, and then 10 μg/ml 2–7-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA, Fluka) was added for 30 min at 37 °C. The cells were harvested by trypsinization and resuspended in PBS. Intracellular reactive oxygen species oxidize DCF-DA, resulting in an increase in fluorescence as measured by flow cytometry as described above. Identification of ERS25—We identified a novel gene termed ERS25 as an oxidative stress-response gene by microarray analysis of cDNA expression following H2O2 treatment in U2OS cells. Human ERS25 encodes for a polypeptide of 227 amino acids and belongs to the Emp24/gp25L/p24 family of proteins. ERS25 is conserved across species including human, mouse, yeast, and worm (Fig. 1A). Domain analysis of the ERS25 sequence indicated that ERS25 contains an N-terminal signal peptide for targeting to the ER, a large GOLD (Golgi dynamics) domain, found in Golgi and lipid-trafficking proteins (1Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: R11Google Scholar), a coiled coil domain, and one transmembrane region (Fig. 1). To characterize the function of this novel p24 family protein, ERS25, we first studied its subcellular localization by cellular fractionation and immunocytochemistry. Since topology predictions indicate an ER signal peptide and transmembrane domain in ERS25 (Fig. 1), we expected ERS25 to be localized in the membrane of compartment of the secretory pathway. Endogenous ERS25 was observed by confocal microscopy in NIH3T3 cells stained with antibodies against ERS25 and calnexin, an ER marker, with TO-PRO3 staining of the nucleus. ERS25 clearly co-localized with calnexin in the ER (Fig. 2A). Cellular fractionation shows that ERS25 was located in the membrane fraction, which includes the plasma membrane, ER, and Golgi apparatus (Fig. 2B). ERS25 was not detected in either the nuclear or the cytosolic fractions (Fig. 2B). To further investigate whether ERS25 was involved in ER or oxidative stress responses, we exposed NIH3T3 cells to ER pertubators such as brefeldin A and tunicamycin, oxidative stress (1 mm H2O2), and heat shock (42 °C). These stresses are known to result in the accumulation of unfolded and unsecreted proteins within the cytosol and ER and cause a stress response depending on their severity. ERS25 was significantly induced by treatment with brefeldin A, hydrogen peroxide, and heat shock (Fig. 2C), whereas remaining at basal levels upon treatment with tunicamycin, exposure to hyperosmotic stress (data not shown), or serum starvation (data not shown), suggesting that ERS25 is involved in the ER stress response regulation. Inhibition of ERS25 Impairs by Oxidative Stress-mediated Apoptosis—To investigate the role of ERS25 in mediating oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis, we used the pBabe-U6-shRNA retroviral vector system to create ERS25 knockdown (shERS25) and control (empty vector) constructs and evaluated the effect of inhibiting endogenous ERS25 expression on apoptosis induced by H2O2. Transfection of ERS25 shRNA resulted in the suppression of ERS25 induction by H2O2 treatment, whereas the control had no effect on induced ERS25 levels in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3A). We generated several stable clones and used these clones to make sure our results were not due to clonal variation. To understand the role of ERS25 in oxidative stress, we treated the cells with various concentrations of H2O2 and measured the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by monitoring the oxidation of the dye DCF-DA by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The ERS25 knockdown cells generated less ROS upon treatment with H2O2 as seen by the decreased right-shift in DCF-DA signal, as compared with control-transfected cells (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the ERS25 knockdown cells clearly showed a significant reduction in the percentage of apoptotic cells as compared with control cells after exposure to H2O2 (Fig. 3, C–E), as demonstrated by three different cell death assays. Thus, depletion of ERS25 expression by shERS25 was effective in inhibiting ROS levels and apoptosis induced by oxidative stress after exposure to H2O2. Inhibition of ERS25 Expression Enhances HSP70 Induction by Heat-shock Response—Having demonstrated that ERS25 is localized in the ER, suggesting that it functions in ER machinery and observing that it is up-regulated by heat shock similarly to HSPs, we were then interested in delineating how ERS25 is involved in the pathway of heat shock. We first looked for changes in expression of HSPs in response to heat shock with or without ERS25 depletion. ERS25 knockdown or control cells were incubated at 42 °C for various times. As shown in Fig. 4, as early as 4 h after heat-shock, ERS25 levels began to be increased and, as expected, the heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) was significantly induced in response to heat shock at 42 °C. Surprisingly, we found that the knockdown of ERS25 expression/induction in response to heat shock enhanced HSP70 protein expression in multiple clones (Fig. 4B), but there was no effect on other HSPs (data not shown). We also determined whether the increase in the HSP70 protein resulted from an increase of HSP70 mRNA. We found that the knockdown of ERS25 also significantly enhanced the levels of HSP70 mRNA as early as 2 h of heat shock, suggesting that the increase of HSP70 induction was likely transcriptional and that ERS25 functions as an upstream regulator of HSP70 gene transcription in response to heat shock. Therefore, we evaluated whether ERS25 could modulate HSP70 gene transcription using a luciferase reporter assay of the HSP70 promoter. NIH3T3 cells transfected by control (empty vector) or shERS25 were transfected with HSP70-luciferase plasmid as well as pRL-TK Renilla luciferase, and then empty pGL3 luciferase plasmid was used as a control. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated at 42 °C for 4 h to induce the maximum amount of HSP70. The empty pBabe-vector-transfected control NIH3T3 cells showed an increase in relative luciferase activity after 4 h of heat shock (Fig. 5A). However, ERS25 knockdown cells showed much higher induction in luciferase activity. Moreover, reintroduction of an ERS25-expressing plasmid into the ERS25 knockdown cells decreased induction of HSP70-luciferase activity after heat shock (Fig. 5A), indicating that HSP70 up-regulation is likely transcriptional. It is well established that HSF1 transcription factor is a regulator of HSP70 transcription activity in response to heat shock (33Morgan W.D. Williams G.T. Morimoto R.I. Greene J. Kingston R.E. Tjian R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1129-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 34Kroeger P.E. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3370-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 35Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). We next investigated whether ERS25-mediated modulation of HSP70 transcription is actually due to the expressional change of HSF1. Fig. 5B shows that the level of HSF1 protein expression in cells transfected with shERS25 was significantly increased following heat-shock stress, as compared with control-transfected cells. Taken together, these data suggest that ERS25 functions as an effector in heat-shock response by maintaining the levels of HSP70 and HSF1. ERS25 Inhibition Enhances Apaf-1 Binding to HSP70—It is clear that the cellular-stress response can mediate cellular protection through expression of HSP70, which can interfere with the process of apoptotic cell death (19Landry J. Bernier D. Chretien P. Nicole L.M. Tanguay R.M. Marceau N. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 2457-2461PubMed Google Scholar, 29Li G.C. Werb Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3218-3222Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 30Subjeck J.R. Sciandra J.J. Chao C.F. Johnson R.J. Br. J. Cancer Suppl. 1982; 5: 127-131PubMed Google Scholar). Previous reports strongly indicate that the antiapoptotic effect of the principal heat-shock protein, HSP70, is mediated through its direct association with the caspase-recruitment domain (CARD) of Apaf-1 and through inhibition of apoptosome formation (31Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 32Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). To understand the potential mechanism by which ERS25 regulates Hsp70 expression in heat-shock response, we investigated the involvement of ERS25 in HSP70-mediated negative regulation of Apaf-1 apoptosome. We characterized the specificity of the interaction between Apaf-1 and HSP70 in vivo with or without ERS25 expression following heat-shock stress by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 6, ERS25 depletion facilitated increased binding between HSP70 and Apaf-1 apoptosome, whereas no binding between these two proteins was detected without heat-shock stress. The data suggest that ERS25 induction in response to heat-shock stress plays a role in maintaining functional apoptosome by regulating HSP70 levels. We identified ERS25 as a novel oxidative stress-responsive gene through a cDNA expression array. Human ERS25 encodes for a 227-amino-acid protein with a molecular mass of 25 kDa and belongs to the Emp24/gp25L/p24 family proteins of yeast (Fig. 1). The precise functions of the p24 family of proteins have not been determined, although genetic, molecular, and biochemical analyses suggest that the proteins are possibly involved in cargo protein selection and packaging, vesicle biogenesis and function, and quality control of protein movement through the secretory system (1Anantharaman V. Aravind L. Genome Biol. 2002; 3: R11Google Scholar, 4Blum R. Pfeiffer F. Feick P. Nastainczyk W. Kohler B. Schafer K.H. Schulz I. J.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). From recent literature, p24 proteins may serve as quality control agents that prevent misfolded or otherwise aberrant proteins from being loaded into vesicles (11Wen C. Greenwald I. J.

PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e704Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and may regulate cell-cell signaling by controlling the amount and timing of protein movement to the surface of the cells. ERS25 contains an N-terminal signal peptide for targeting to the ER, which we have confirmed by immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation. The ER localization of ERS25 is a unique feature as compared with the other known family members, which are mainly localized to the cis-Golgi network (8Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M.

Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar), although human Gmp25 is known to partially localize in the ER (10Dominguez M. Dejgaard K. Fullekrug J. Dahan S. Fazel A. Paccaud J.P. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Nilsson T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 751-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that ERS25 is induced by a variety of stress inducers including ER stress, oxidative damage, and heat shock. The common element among all these stress responses is that these stresses are known to cause the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol and the nucleus. Interestingly, tunicamycin, which causes ER stress by inhibiting glycosylation (40Heifetz A. Keenan R.W. Elbein A.D. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2186-2192Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 41King I.A. Tabiowo A. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), did not cause an increase in ERS25, but brefeldin A, which causes ER stress by inhibiting protein transport into the Golgi (42Strous G.J. van Kerkhof P. van Meer G. Rijnboutt S. Stoorvogel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2341-2347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was able to strongly induce ERS25. These data imply that ERS25 may be involved in facilitating protein transport, rather than being involved in general stress response to the accumulation of excess protein in the ER. This is consistent with current data on the Emp24/gp25L/p24 family of proteins that are known to be critical components of the coated vesicles that are involved in the transportation of cargo molecules from the ER to the Golgi (4Blum R. Pfeiffer F. Feick P. Nastainczyk W. Kohler B. Schafer K.H. Schulz I. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 537-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gommel D. Orci L. Emig E.M. Hannah M.J. Ravazzola M. Nickel W. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. Sohn K. FEBS Lett. 1999; 447: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Significantly, shRNA-directed inhibition of ERS25 attenuates oxidative stress-induced ROS and abrogates apoptotic cell death upon H2O2 treatment. However, the overexpression of ERS25 alone is insufficient to induce apoptosis (data not shown), and further studies are required to elucidate how ERS25 contributes to ROS generation. The p24 family of proteins has been implicated in the unfolded protein response (11Wen C. Greenwald I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1165-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HSP70 family proteins are known to play important roles in preventing misfolding and aggregation of newly synthesized or unfolded proteins (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (3077) Google Scholar, 44Hand J.W. Walker H. Hornsey S. Field S.B. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. Relat. Stud. Phys. Chem.

Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that ERS25 is induced by heat shock and abrogation of ERS25 expression in NIH3T3 cells resulted in increased HSP70 expression upon heat shock. Thus, it is predictable that the knockdown of ERS25 levels may cause a compensatory increase of HSP70 levels to cope with the cellular stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins. It has been proposed that HSP70 up-regulation prevents apoptosis at the level of the apoptosome (31Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 32Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that Apaf-1 and HSP70 interaction occurs in vivo and in a cell-free system and that HSP70 binds to Apaf-1 and inhibits caspase-9 cleavage, therefore inhibiting cell death (31Saleh A. Srinivasula S.M. Balkir L. Robbins P.D. Alnemri E.S. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 476-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar, 32Beere H.M. Wolf B.B. Cain K. Mosser D.D. Mahboubi A. Kuwana T. Tailor P. Morimoto R.I. Cohen G.M. Green D.R. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 469-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Due to the increased expression of HSP70 in ERS25 knockdown cells and the ability of these cells to resist oxidative damage after treatment with H2O2, we looked for any alteration in the ability of HSP70 to bind Apaf-1 in the ERS25 knockdown cells. We observed increased levels of binding between HSP70 and Apaf-1 in these cells, which would imply that the ERS25 knockdown cells may be more resistant to apoptosis. This is likely due to the increased expression of HSP70 in the ERS25 knockdown cells. Consistent with the previous reports, we were able to clearly see the increased resistance of ERS25 knockdown cells to apoptosis induced by oxidative damage. ERS25 is a novel protein, which is located in the ER and is induced by stressors that result in the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in both the cytosol and the ER. It is probable that ERS25 is induced to increase transport of these proteins to the Golgi. In our characterization of ERS25, we demonstrate that ERS25 is important for the induction of apoptosis upon oxidative damage and for proper modulation of HSP70 expression upon heat shock. The function of ERS25 in the ER remains unclear; however, our data seem to indicate that it plays a role to facilitate protein transport rather than assisting in the clearance of the excess accumulation of protein induced upon stress. It is possible that ERS25 is necessary for the proper processing of other stress response proteins, and therefore, the cell undergoes an aberrant stress response in the absence of ERS25. Further investigations into ERS25 are necessary to elucidate its role in the stress response. We thank R. Morimoto for the HSP70-luciferace and expression constructs and Y.

Surface plasmon resonance analyses indicated that Escherichia coli-expressed variable domain fragments (Fv) of 1C49 had the high affinity constants and slow dissociation constants typical of antigen-antibody interactions. Linear van't Hoff analyses suggested that the interaction is enthalpy-driven. We resolved the crystal structure of 1C49 Fv bound to ABC ring compound of ciguatoxin 3C at a resolution of 1.7Å. The binding pocket of the antibody had many aromatic rings and bound the antigen by shape complementarity typical of hapten-antibody interactions. Three hydrogen bonds and many van der Waals interactions were present. We mutated several residues of the antibody to Ala, and we used surface plasmon resonance to analyze the interactions between the mutated antibodies and the antigen. This analysis identified Tyr-91 and Trp-96 in the light chain as hot spots for the interaction, and other residues made incremental contributions by conferring enthalpic advantages and reducing the dissociation rate constant. Systematic mutation of Tyr-91 indicated that CH-π and π-π interactions between the aromatic ring at this site and the antigen made substantial contributions to the association, and van der Waals interactions inhibited dissociation, suggesting that aromaticity and bulkiness are critical for the specific recognition of polyether compounds by proteins.

Ciguatera is a form of food poisoning caused by the ingestion of reef fish that have accumulated trace amounts of ciguatoxins of dinoflagellate origin via the food chain. More than 50,000 people suffer from ciguatera annually, making it one of the most common sources of food poisoning (1Hirama M. Chem.

The disease is characterized by gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular disturbances that often persist for months or years, and in severe cases, paralysis, coma, and death may occur (1Hirama M. Chem. Rec. 2005; 5: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ciguatoxins exert their effects by binding to voltage-sensitive sodium ion channels, causing persistent activation of the channels (1Hirama M. Chem. Rec. 2005; 5: 240-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Ciguatoxin and its congener, CTX3C, are structurally classified as ladder-like polyethers (Fig. 1) (5Yasumoto T. Chem.

A major obstacle to avoiding the disease is that ciguateric fish look, taste, and smell the same as uncontaminated fish. In addition, neither cooking nor freezing detoxifies the heat-stable ciguatoxins. Despite the seriousness of ciguatera, there is currently no rapid and reliable method for detecting these toxins at fisheries. The traditional method is a mouse bioassay of lipid extracts (7Lewis R.J. Sellin M. Toxicon. 1993; 31: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

Fig. 1) and an Fab library prepared from the spleens of mice immunized with CTX3C-ABC conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (16Nagumo Y. Oguri H. Tsumoto K. Shindo Y. Hirama M. Tsumuraya T. Fujii I. Tomioka Y. Mizugaki M. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 289: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Fab fragment of 1C49 binds CTX3C-ABC and CTX3C-ABCD with dissociation constants (Kd) of 8.6 × 10-8 m and 2.4 × 10-5 m, respectively (16Nagumo Y. Oguri H. Tsumoto K. Shindo Y. Hirama M. Tsumuraya T. Fujii I. Tomioka Y. Mizugaki M. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 289: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). 1C49 also bound to CTX3C, although the affinity is reduced as compared with CTX3C-ABC (16Nagumo Y. Oguri H. Tsumoto K.

Elucidation of the molecular mechanism of the specific binding of the antibody to the ciguatoxin fragment would enable the antibody-based ciguatoxin immunoassay to be improved. Moreover, many marine toxins have polyether structures. These toxins include maitotoxin (5Yasumoto T. Chem. Rec. 2001; 1: 228-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and gambierol, which also cause ciguatera (5Yasumoto T. Chem.

Tetrahedron Lett. 1996; 37: 7087-7090Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, research focused on antibodies that can recognize polyether compounds may produce a more effective antibody-based immunoassay based on well understood mechanisms. Here, we investigated the binding of 1C49 to the CTX3C-ABC polyether from a structural viewpoint. First, we resolved the crystal structure of the 1C49 Fv fragment in complex with CTX3C-ABC at a resolution of 1.7 Å. CTX3C-ABC is deeply buried in the binding pocket and interacts with 1C49 by using three hydrogen bonds and many van der Waals interactions. Kinetic analyses of mutant proteins indicated that L-Tyr-91 and L-Trp-96 are critical residues, i.e. hot spots, for the interaction. Systematic mutation of L-Tyr-91 showed that aromatic interactions and the bulkiness by L-Tyr-91 are essential for the association and the inhibition of dissociation, respectively. Construction of an Expression Vector for the Fv Fragment of Monoclonal Antibody 1C49 and Its Mutant Proteins—The gene encoding a fragment of the immunoglobulin variable regions (Fv) was amplified with KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Toyobo) by using a vector expressing the Fab fragment of 1C49 (16Nagumo Y. Oguri H. Tsumoto K. Shindo Y. Hirama M. Tsumuraya T. Fujii I. Tomioka Y. Mizugaki M. Kumagai I. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 289: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as a template. To amplify a fragment of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH), we used the following primer sets (restriction enzyme sites are underlined): 1C49-VH-NcoI-back (5′-NNNCCATGGCCCAGGTGCAGCTGCTCGAGTCTGGGGCTGA-3′), 1C49-VH-SacII-forward (5′-NNNCCGCGGAAGAGACGGTGACTGAGG-3′). The PCR products were digested by NcoI and SacII and then inserted into a T7 promoter-based expression vector (22Makabe K. Asano R. Ito T. Tsumoto K. Kudo T. Kumagai I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 328: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to attach a His tag at the C terminus and a pel-B signal sequence at the N terminus of VH. A fragment of the variable region of the light chain (VL) was first amplified with the primer set 1C49-VL-NcoI-back (5′-NNNCCATGGCCGACATTCAGATGACACAGTCTC-3′), 1C49-VL-SacII-forward (5′-NNNCCGCGGCCCGTTTGATTTCCAGATTG-3′) (restriction enzyme sites are underlined), and the product was also inserted into the T7 promoter-based expression vector to attach a His tag at the C terminus and a pel-B signal sequence at the N terminus. Subsequently, the His-tagged VL fragment was amplified by using the vector resulting from the first amplification and the primer set SpeI-pel-B-back (5′-CACTAGTTATTTCAAGGAGACAGTCATAATGAAATACC-3′) and BamHI-His tag-forward (5′-NNNGGATCCGCTATTAATGGTGGTGATGATGGTG-3′), followed by digestion by SpeI and BamHI. By inserting the product downstream of the VH-expressing vector described above, we created an expression vector with a gene for the Fv fragment where the genes for VH and VL are connected in tandem. pel-B signal sequences and His tags were attached to the N and C termini of both chains, respectively. The expression vector is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. The expression vectors for the mutant proteins were constructed by amplifying a DNA fragment by the two-stage PCR method using synthesized primers designed for each mutation, and inserting these instead of the VH or VL fragment described above into the vectors. The accuracy of the DNA sequences was confirmed by sequencing using an ABI 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Expression and Purification of the 1C49 Fv Fragment and Its Mutant Proteins—Transformed Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) harboring the expression vector for the desired protein was grown until the early stationary phase at 28 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg ml-1 ampicillin. To induce expression of the desired protein, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was continued for 14 h. The culture was centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation at 60% saturation, followed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The protein pellet was solubilized in 30–40 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and then dialyzed against the same buffer. Fv fragments were purified with His Bind Resin (Novagen) previously charged with NiSO4. The protein solution was loaded onto the column, and the column was washed with wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole). Fv fragments were eluted with elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole). Fractions containing Fv fragments were dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.5) and then further purified on a Resource S column (GE Healthcare Biosciences AB) equilibrated with the same buffer. Absorbed proteins were eluted by using a 0–0.8 m gradient of NaCl in 50 mm phosphate (pH 6.5). Fractions containing the Fv fragments were collected and used for further experiments. For the H-W33A, L-Y91L, and L-Y91V mutants, because of the insolubility of the expressed proteins they were prepared by refolding from the insoluble fraction of cells with a stepwise dialysis system described previously (23Tsumoto K.

Crystallization of the 1C49 Fv Fragment—Purified 1C49 Fv fragment was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and then concentrated to 10.5 mg ml-1. CTX3C-ABC solution (10 mm in DMSO) was added to the protein solution to a final molar ratio of protein:CTX3C-ABC of 1:1.2, followed by a static incubation at room temperature for 1 h. The initial crystallization conditions were screened by the sparse matrix method at 20 °C, using a Crystal Screen kit and Crystal Screen2 kit (Hampton Research) and Wizard I and Wizard II (Emerald Biostructures, Bainbridge Island, WA). Crystals of the 1C49 Fv fragment in complex with CTX3C-ABC most suitable for further analyses were grown from 0.1 m MES buffer (pH 5.7) containing 25% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 5000 and 2 m ammonium sulfate by the hanging drop, vapor-diffusion method. Diffraction Data Collection and Processing—X-ray diffraction data were collected on the beamline NW12 at Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) under cryogenic conditions (100 K). Crystals were soaked in a crystallization buffer containing 15% glycerol before mounting. Diffraction data were collected up to a resolution of 1.7 Å. The data were indexed and integrated with the program HKL2000 (26Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38594) Google Scholar) and were scaled and merged with the program SCALEA (27Weiss M. J. Appl.

Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). VH and VL regions of an Fab (PDB codes 1AXS and 1FJ1) were used as search models for VH and VL, respectively. An electron density derived from CTX3C-ABC was observed at the CDR region (supplemental Fig. S2). The structure coordinates of CTX3C-ABC were prepared with the program Chem Office 6.0 (CambridgeSoft, Cambridge, MA), and the topology file and the parameter file of CTX3C-ABC were prepared at the HIC-UP web site (30Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). To monitor the refinement, a random 5% subset of all reflections was set aside for calculation of the Rfree factor. The positional and individual B factor refinements were carried out automatically with the program LAFIRE (31Yao M. Zhou Y. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After automatic refinement and model fitting by LAFIRE, several cycles of refinement with the program CNS and manual model fitting were carried out. Finally, the water molecules were picked automatically, and then ligand molecules were placed manually. The crystallographic R values and Rfree values converged to 19.8% and 21.0%, respectively. The stereochemical quality of the final refined models was analyzed by the program PROCHECK (32Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Residues are numbered, and framework regions and complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) are designated according to Kabat et al. (33Kabat E.A.Wu T.T., Perry, H. Gottesman, K., and Foeller, C. (1991) Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, Fifth Ed., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MDGoogle Scholar). The atoms that form the contact between 1C49 Fv and CTX3C-ABC were identified with the CONTACT program in the CCP4 suite, in which the length thresholds of C-C, C-N, C-O, O-O, O-N, and N-N are 4.1, 3.8, 3.7, 3.3, 3.4, and 3.4 Å, respectively. The figures were drawn with the program PyMOL (DeLano Scientific LLC). The surface area was calculated with the program AREAIMOL in the CCP4 suite using a probe radius of 1.4 Å. Analyses of the Interaction between CTX3C-ABC and the 1C49 Fv Fragment or Its Mutants—The interaction between CTX3C-ABC and the 1C49 Fv fragment or its mutant proteins were analyzed by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy with BIACORE 2000 (GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Bovine serum albumin-conjugated CTX3C-ABC was immobilized onto the cells in a CM5 sensor chip. Various concentrations of the 1C49 Fv fragment or its mutants in HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P20) were flowed over the CTX3C-ABC. The data were normalized by subtracting the response from a blank cell in which bovine serum albumin alone was immobilized. BIAevaluation software (GE Healthcare Bio-Science AB) was used to analyze the data. Kinetic parameters were calculated by a global fitting analysis with the assumptions of the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The association constants of L-Y91A and L-Y91S mutants were calculated by using a Scatchard plot because of their fast dissociation rate constants. Crystal Structure of the 1C49 Fv Fragment in Complex with CTX3C-ABC—We solved the crystal structure of the 1C49 Fv fragment in complex with CTX3C-ABC by the molecular replacement method at a resolution of 1.7 Å. The CDRs of the antibody formed a cavity around the ligand binding site, and the antigen, CTX3C-ABC, lay in the cavity (Fig. 2, A and B). A number of aromatic residues, H-Tyr-100a, L-Tyr-49, L-Tyr-91, H-Trp-33, L-Trp-96, and L-Phe-94, were located around the ligand binding site and contributed to ligand binding by van der Waals interactions (Fig. 2C). However, there were no polar residues around the binding site, suggesting that hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions have little effect. Fig. 2B represents an electrostatic surface of 1C49 viewed from above the ligand binding site. Although the entrance of the cavity is charged, the inside is relatively noncharged, also suggesting that van der Waals interactions have greater effects than electrostatic interactions. Ether groups in CTX3C-ABC do not act as proton acceptors for hydrogen bonding despite their abundance. CTX3C-ABC is deeply buried in the cavity, with 457 Å2 of its 529 Å2 surface area (86.4%) within the cavity, suggesting a well organized shape complementarity. The contacts between 1C49 and CTX3C-ABC observed in the crystal structure are listed in supplemental Table S1. CTX3C-ABC has 62 interactions with 15 residues, which are mainly in CDRs. Despite these extensive interactions, only three residues, H-Gln-35, H-Tyr-100a, and L-Trp-96, formed hydrogen bonds, again suggesting the predominance of van der Waals interactions. The binding of CTX3C-ABC is achieved mainly through many aromatic rings, such as those in Trp and Tyr. The three water molecules (Wat) that construct hydrogen bonds with both CTX3C-ABC and 1C49 are observed at the interface (Table 2). Wat-8 and Wat-10 are exposed to solvent above the ligand binding pocket, whereas Wat-50 is located inside the cavity and fills the interface between CTX3C-ABC and the antibody. Fig. 3 is a schematic of the residues around the ligand.TABLE 2Contacts between 1C49 and CTX3C-ABC via water moleculesWater moleculeInteracting atomDistanceResidueAtomÅWat-8CTX3C-ABCO242.66H-W33O2.86Wat-10CTX3C-ABCO232.86L-Lys-32Nζ2.98L-Tyr-91O2.75L-Phe-94Nζ2.96Wat-50CTX3C-ABCO113.64H-Gln-35N∈22.83H-Ser-99O2.79 Open table in a new tab Kinetic Analysis of the Interaction between CTX3C-ABC and the 1C49 Fv Fragment—We used SPR to explore the kinetics of the interaction between CTX3C-ABC and the 1C49 Fv fragment. 1C49 Fv was injected into flow cells on which bovine serum albumin-conjugated CTX3C-ABC was immobilized. We applied a global curve-fitting analysis to the SPR sensorgrams to generate response curves (Fig. 4A) using the assumptions of the Langmuir binding model and a stoichiometry of 1:1. We then used these responses to determine the association rate constant and dissociation rate constant (kon and koff) of the interaction between CTX3C-ABC and the 1C49 Fv fragment at 10 °C; kon was determined to be 7.77 × 105 m-1s-1, and koff was determined to be 3.50 × 10-4 s-1, resulting in an association constant (KA) of 2.22 × 109 m-1 (Table 3). The fast association rate constant, slow dissociation rate constant, and resulting high association constant are typical of antigen-antibody interactions. To obtain the activation energy for the interaction of CTX3C-ABC with the 1C49-Fv fragment, the kinetic analyses were performed at a range of temperatures (10, 15, 20, and 25 °C). On the basis of the temperature dependence of the association constant (Fig. 4B), the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHvan't Hoff) was calculated to be -31.2 kJ m-1, suggesting that this interaction is enthalpy-driven.TABLE 3Kinetic parameters at 10 °C and van't Hoff enthalpy of wild-type and mutant 1C49 Fv fragmentskonaThese values were obtained with a global curve fitting analysis of the SPR sensorgrams with the assumptions of the Langmuir binding model and a stoichiometry of 1:1koffaThese values were obtained with a global curve fitting analysis of the SPR sensorgrams with the assumptions of the Langmuir binding model and a stoichiometry of 1:1KAΔHvan't Hoffbvan't Hoff enthalpies were obtained from the slope of the van't Hoff plot by the equation ln KD = ΔH/RT – ΔS/Rm–1 s–1s–1m–1kJmol–1WT7.77 × 1053.50 × 10–42.22 × 109–31.2L-Y49A1.03 × 1068.06 × 10–41.28 × 109–28.4L-Y91AcThe association constant was determined by a steady-state fit of the binding data from maximal equilibrium values of the SPR sensorgrams3.55 × 106–9.23L-F94A5.53 × 1052.30 × 10–32.41 × 108–16.0L-W96ANDdND, no detectable bindingNDNDNDH-S99A5.19 × 1054.88 × 10–31.06 × 108–24.7H-D100A1.48 × 1055.70 × 10–32.60 × 107–28.2H-W33A7.93 × 1051.35 × 10–25.87 × 107–8.60H-Q35A1.54 × 1055.58 × 10–32.67 × 107–20.7H-Y100aA8.21 × 1053.74 × 10–42.20 × 109–26.9a These values were obtained with a global curve fitting analysis of the SPR sensorgrams with the assumptions of the Langmuir binding model and a stoichiometry of 1:1b van't Hoff enthalpies were obtained from the slope of the van't Hoff plot by the equation ln KD = ΔH/RT – ΔS/Rc The association constant was determined by a steady-state fit of the binding data from maximal equilibrium values of the SPR sensorgramsd ND, no detectable binding Open table in a new tab Effects of Mutating Residues around the CTX3C-ABC Binding Site—To investigate the contribution of residues around the CTX3C-ABC binding site, we created Ala mutants of L-Y49, L-Y91, L-F94, L-W96, H-S99, H-D100, H-W33, H-Q35, and H-Y100a, which are residues in CDR regions and interact with plural atoms in CTX3C-ABC, and used SPR to evaluate their binding affinities to CTX3C-ABC (supplemental Fig. S3).
