https://openalex.org/W1941076503,"CTCF and the associated cohesin complex play a central role in insulator function and higher-order chromatin organization of mammalian genomes. Recent studies identified a correlation between the orientation of CTCF-binding sites (CBSs) and chromatin loops. To test the functional significance of this observation, we combined CRISPR/Cas9-based genomic-DNA-fragment editing with chromosome-conformation-capture experiments to show that the location and relative orientations of CBSs determine the specificity of long-range chromatin looping in mammalian genomes, using protocadherin (Pcdh) and β-globin as model genes. Inversion of CBS elements within the Pcdh enhancer reconfigures the topology of chromatin loops between the distal enhancer and target promoters and alters gene-expression patterns. Thus, although enhancers can function in an orientation-independent manner in reporter assays, in the native chromosome context, the orientation of at least some enhancers carrying CBSs can determine both the architecture of topological chromatin domains and enhancer/promoter specificity. These findings reveal how 3D chromosome architecture can be encoded by linear genome sequences."
https://openalex.org/W1935201742,"The peripheral nervous system has remarkable regenerative capacities in that it can repair a fully cut nerve. This requires Schwann cells to migrate collectively to guide regrowing axons across a ‘bridge’ of new tissue, which forms to reconnect a severed nerve. Here we show that blood vessels direct the migrating cords of Schwann cells. This multicellular process is initiated by hypoxia, selectively sensed by macrophages within the bridge, which via VEGF-A secretion induce a polarized vasculature that relieves the hypoxia. Schwann cells then use the blood vessels as “tracks” to cross the bridge taking regrowing axons with them. Importantly, disrupting the organization of the newly formed blood vessels in vivo, either by inhibiting the angiogenic signal or by re-orienting them, compromises Schwann cell directionality resulting in defective nerve repair. This study provides important insights into how the choreography of multiple cell-types is required for the regeneration of an adult tissue."

Together, our work establishes YAP/TAZ as critical mediators of alternative Wnt signaling. Wnt proteins are morphogens that elicit diverse receptor-mediated signaling pathways to control development and tissue homeostasis. Canonical Wnt signaling acts through β-catenin/TCF transcriptional activity (referred to as “Wnt/β-catenin signaling”) (Logan and Nusse, 2004Logan C.Y. Nusse R.

Wnt/beta-catenin signaling: components, mechanisms, and diseases.Dev. Cell. 2009; 17: 9-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). Wnt3a is a classic canonical Wnt ligand, although it has been shown to elicit both β-catenin-dependent and independent responses (Angers and Moon, 2009Angers S. Moon R.T. Proximal events in Wnt signal transduction.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Noncanonical Wnt signaling mediates biological responses that do not involve β-catenin/TCF activity (referred to as “alternative Wnt signaling”), and Wnt5a/b are prototype alternative Wnt ligands (van Amerongen, 2012van Amerongen R. Alternative Wnt pathways and receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In vertebrate, alternative Wnt signaling is involved in planar cell polarity (PCP), convergent extension movements, dorsoventral patterning, tissue regeneration, and tumorigenesis. During these processes, alternative Wnt signaling induces cytoskeletal and migratory changes and antagonizes canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. However, these β-catenin-independent signaling responses remain poorly characterized at the molecular level (van Amerongen, 2012van Amerongen R. Alternative Wnt pathways and receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The Frizzled (FZD) receptors are transducers of both Wnt/β-catenin and alternative Wnt signaling. An interesting yet controversial aspect of FZD is the requirement of G proteins. Although Gα proteins have been previously shown to modulate Wnt signaling (Katanaev et al., 2005Katanaev V.L. Ponzielli R. Sémériva M. Tomlinson A.

Thus, identifying G proteins and novel effectors involved in the alternative Wnt signaling is a key unresolved issue in the field. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway functions to inhibit the activity of YAP/TAZ transcriptional co-activators. The Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway has emerged as a hub that integrates diverse stimuli including mechanical and cytoskeletal cues, cell adhesion, apico-basolateral polarity, and mitogens to control cell growth and organ size (Pan, 2010Pan D.

The biology of YAP/TAZ: hippo signaling and beyond.Physiol. Rev. 2014; 94: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). The core Mst1/2-Lats1/2 kinase cascade inhibits YAP/TAZ through direct phosphorylation, which results in cytoplasmic retention via 14-3-3 binding and further promotes β-TrCP-mediated YAP/TAZ ubiquitination and degradation. Upon inhibition of the Hippo pathway, YAP/TAZ are activated and translocated into the nucleus to bind TEAD family transcription factors to stimulate target gene expression involved in cell proliferation, stem cell self-renewal, and tumorigenesis (Mo et al., 2014Mo J.S. Park H.W. Guan K.L. The Hippo signaling pathway in stem cell biology and cancer.EMBO Rep. 2014; 15: 642-656PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that YAP/TAZ are critical mediators of the alternative Wnt pathway. We identify Wnt5a/b and Wnt3a as potent activators of YAP/TAZ and further uncover a Wnt signaling pathway termed the “alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ signaling axis,” which consists of Wnt-FZD/ROR-Gα12/13-Rho-Lats1/2-YAP/TAZ-TEAD. Wnt and FZD-induced YAP/TAZ activation was independent of LRP5/6 co-receptors and β-catenin. Moreover, we show that alternative Wnt ligands WNT5A/B and other secreted Wnt inhibitors, including DKK1, BMP4, and IGFBP4, are major YAP/TAZ-TEAD target genes. Finally, we demonstrate the role of alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ signaling axis in gene expression, osteogenic differentiation, cell migration, and antagonism of canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Together, our work reveals a critical role of YAP/TAZ in alternative Wnt signaling and its biological responses. Despite several studies regarding the interaction between Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Wnt signaling, there is no report showing whether Wnt ligands can regulate YAP/TAZ activity in vivo. For this, we examined YAP/TAZ protein expression in mammary gland tissues from 3-month-old MMTV-Wnt1 and myc-tagged constitutively active-β-catenin (MMTV-ΔNβ-cat) transgenic mice (Kim et al., 2008Kim Y.C. Clark R.J. Ranheim E.A. Alexander C.M. Wnt1 expression induces short-range and long-range cell recruitments that modify mammary tumor development and are not induced by a cell-autonomous beta-catenin effector.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 10145-10153Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In the Wnt1-expressing mammary gland, we observed significant accumulation of YAP/TAZ and their target gene CTGF, whereas ΔNβ-catenin expression had no effect on YAP/TAZ (Figures 1A and 1B ). Lats1/2 inhibits YAP/TAZ by phosphorylation, which can be readily detected with phospho-YAPS127 antibody or by mobility shift on a phos-tag gel. In addition, the Hippo pathway has notable effect on TAZ protein levels compared to YAP because TAZ has two phosphodegrons (Liu et al., 2010Liu C.Y. Zha Z.Y. Zhou X. Zhang H. Huang W. Zhao D. Li T. Chan S.W. Lim C.J. Hong W. et al.The hippo tumor pathway promotes TAZ degradation by phosphorylating a phosphodegron and recruiting the SCFbeta-TrCP E3 ligase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37159-37169Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). For the above reasons, we use YAP phosphorylation status and TAZ protein levels as indicators for their regulation by the Hippo pathway. In MCF10A mammary epithelial cells, both TAZ and β-catenin protein levels were increased upon Wnt3a stimulation. Unexpectedly, pretreatment with DKK1, an antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suppressed Wnt3a-induced β-catenin accumulation but did not affect TAZ accumulation (Figure 1C), suggesting that Wnt3a activates YAP/TAZ via the alternative Wnt signaling pathway. To directly test this hypothesis, we utilized alternative Wnt ligands Wnt5a and Wnt5b. Treatment with Wnt5a or Wnt5b induced YAP/TAZ accumulation as well as target gene CTGF and CYR61 expression, while no increase in β-catenin was observed (Figures 1D and S1A). Of note, Wnt5a/b stimulation induced Dvl2 phosphorylation, a hallmark of alternative Wnt pathway activation (González-Sancho et al., 2013González-Sancho J.M. Greer Y.E. Abrahams C.L. Takigawa Y. Baljinnyam B. Lee K.H. Lee K.S. Rubin J.S. Brown A.M. Functional consequences of Wnt-induced dishevelled 2 phosphorylation in canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling.J. Biol.

USA. 2012; 109: 4044-4051Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Wnt ligands activate YAP/TAZ via the alternative Wnt pathway. Next, we investigated YAP/TAZ regulation by Wnt in different cell lines and conditions. In ST2 bone marrow stromal cells, both Wnt3a and Wnt5a induce YAP dephosphorylation, as indicated by the fast migrating bands on the phostag gel (Figure 1E). In parallel, protein levels of both YAP and TAZ were increased. Notably, these effects were not blocked by DKK1, whereas β-catenin accumulation was abolished (Figure 1E). Wnt3a and Wnt5a showed similar kinetics on YAP/TAZ activation (Figure S1B). We also tested control and Wnt3a-stably expressing L cells (L-Wnt3a), which are widely used in the field to generate Wnt3a-conditioned medium. In control L cells, both Wnt3a and Wnt5a induced YAP/TAZ activation, but only Wnt3a increased β-catenin (Figure 1F, lanes 1–3). Importantly, in L-Wnt3a cells, β-catenin and YAP/TAZ were highly activated compared to control cells (Figure 1F, compare lanes 1 and 7). Further treatment with R-spondin1 (RSPO1, an agonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling) potentiated, whereas DKK1 inhibited β-catenin accumulation. However, neither treatment affected YAP/TAZ activation status, suggesting that Wnt3a-induced YAP/TAZ activation is exclusively through the alternative Wnt pathway (Figure 1F, compare lanes 7, 10, and 11). Consistently, YAP dephosphorylation in the absence of β-catenin accumulation was evident in L-Wnt5a stable cells (Figure S1C). Wnt ligand-induced YAP/TAZ activation was also observed in human stem cells such as HUES9 human embryonic stem cells and primary human bone-marrow stem cells (BMS) (Figures S1D and S1E). In these cells, Wnt3a induced stronger YAP/TAZ activation than β-catenin. Consistent with YAP/TAZ activation, Wnt5b increased nuclear YAP/TAZ (Figure 1G). Moreover, Wnt5b decreased cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ and concomitantly increased nuclear YAP/TAZ in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) (Figures 1H and S1F), indicating that Wnt5b stimulates YAP/TAZ to translocate from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. Together, our results establish a Wnt signaling pathway described as the alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ signaling axis. Wnt signals are transduced through FZD family receptors. The LRP5/6 co-receptors are required for activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, while FZD alone or together with ROR1/2 co-receptors can trigger alternative Wnt signaling pathways (Niehrs, 2012Niehrs C. The complex world of WNT receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2012; 13: 767-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, Roman-Roman et al., 2004Roman-Roman S. Shi D.L. Stiot V. Haÿ E. Vayssière B. Garcia T. Baron R. Rawadi G. Murine Frizzled-1 behaves as an antagonist of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5725-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms underlying Wnt-induced YAP/TAZ activation, we expressed FZD receptors in HEK293A cells. FZD1 triggered alternative Wnt signaling evident by the induction of Dvl2 and c-Jun phosphorylation but had no effect on β-catenin accumulation (Figure 2A). Moreover, FZD1 dose-dependently induced endogenous YAP dephosphorylation and TAZ accumulation. Consequently, FZD1 promoted YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation and target gene expression (Figures 2B and S2A). These observations indicate that FZD1 initiates β-catenin-independent alternative Wnt signaling to activate YAP/TAZ. There are multiple members in the FZD family. Unlike FZD1, expression of FZD2 or FZD5 alone did not induce significant YAP/TAZ activation (Figure 2C). The receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 functions as a co-receptor to potentiate FZD-induced alternative Wnt signaling. ROR1 alone had no effect on YAP/TAZ activation. However, co-expression of ROR1 with either FZD2 or FZD5 induced significant YAP dephosphorylation and TAZ accumulation (Figure 2C). Consistent with previous studies, the tyrosine kinase activity of ROR1 was not required to enhance FZD signaling (Figure S2B) (Grumolato et al., 2010Grumolato L. Liu G. Mong P. Mudbhary R. Biswas R. Arroyave R. Vijayakumar S. Economides A.N. Aaronson S.A.

We also tested the adhesion receptor CELSR (Flamingo), which interacts with FZD to regulate PCP signaling (van Amerongen, 2012van Amerongen R. Alternative Wnt pathways and receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar).

Recent studies have established GPCR signaling, particularly those coupled to Gα12/13 and Gαq/11, as major upstream activators of YAP/TAZ (Feng et al., 2014Feng X. Degese M.S. Iglesias-Bartolome R.

FZDs have the 7-transmembrane topology of a typical GPCR though whether FZDs function as conventional GPCRs has not been unequivocally demonstrated (van Amerongen, 2012van Amerongen R. Alternative Wnt pathways and receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: 4Crossref Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To this end, we examined YAP/TAZ activation by Wnt in Gα-protein knockdown HEK293A cells. Notably, knockdown of Gα12/13 was sufficient to block FZD1-induced YAP/TAZ activation (Figure 2D). However, neither knockdown of Gαq/11 nor inhibition of Gαi/o by pertussis toxin (PTX) affected YAP/TAZ levels (Figures 2D, S2D, and S2E). Consistently, inhibition of PLC or PKC, which are downstream effectors of Gαq/11, had no effect on FZD1-induced YAP activation (Figure S2E). Moreover, knockdown of Gα12/13 also impaired both Wnt3a and Wnt5b-induced YAP/TAZ activation (Figures S2F and S2G). Of note, Gα12/13 knockdown did not affect Wnt3a-induced β-catenin accumulation (Figure S2F), consistent with previous report (Regard et al., 2011Regard J.B. Cherman N. Palmer D. Kuznetsov S.A. Celi F.S. Guettier J.M. Chen M. Bhattacharyya N. Wess J. Coughlin S.R. et al.Wnt/β-catenin signaling is differentially regulated by Gα proteins and contributes to fibrous dysplasia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2011; 108: 20101-20106Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). To unambiguously establish Gα12/13 as critical mediators of the alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ signaling axis, we generated Gα12/13 and Gαq/11 double-knockout (DKO) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) by introducing adenovirus-expressing Cre recombinase into Gna12−/−Gna13f/f or Gna11−/−Gnaqf/f MEFs. Significantly, Wnt5b-induced YAP/TAZ activation was abolished in Gα12/13 DKO MEFs, but not in Gαq/11 DKO cells (Figures 2E, 2F, and S2H). Moreover, re-expression of Gα12 in the Gα12/13 DKO cells restored YAP/YAZ activation by Wnt5b (Figure S2I). These results provide compelling evidence that Gα12/13 are bone fide mediators of alternative Wnt signaling, leading to YAP/TAZ activation. The Rho GTPase family is the major effector of Gα12/13 signaling, and also plays a critical role in both alternative Wnt signaling and Hippo-YAP/TAZ regulation (Schlessinger et al., 2009Schlessinger K.

C3 transferase, a specific RhoA inhibitor, significantly blocked Wnt3a-induced YAP/TAZ activation in L-Wnt3a cells (Figure 1F). To further verify the involvement of Rho GTPases, the effect of Rho family members was tested. The dominant-negative (DN) mutants of RhoA and Rac1, but not Cdc42, were able to suppress FZD1-induced YAP/TAZ activation. Moreover, in the Gα12/13 knockdown cells, the constitutively active (CA) forms of RhoA and Rac1 induced YAP/TAZ activation (Figure 2G). Finally, inhibition of Rho family GTPases by Rho-GDI also blocked FZD1-induced YAP/TAZ activation (Figure 2H). LPA and its cognate LPAR1 were included as positive controls (Yu et al., 2012Yu F.X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H. Tumaneng K. Li H. et al.Regulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway by G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.Cell. 2012; 150: 780-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Previously, RhoA has been shown to activate YAP/TAZ through inhibiting Lats1/2 activity (Yu et al., 2012Yu F.X. Zhao B. Panupinthu N. Jewell J.L. Lian I. Wang L.H. Zhao J. Yuan H. Tumaneng K. Li H. et al.Regulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway by G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.Cell. 2012; 150: 780-791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined FZD1-induced YAP/TAZ activation in SAV1, MST1/2, or LATS1/2 KO HEK293A cells to identify the intersection between FZD1 and the Hippo pathway (Figure 2I). FZD1 expression further activated YAP/TAZ in either SAV1 KO or Mst1/2 DKO cells, but not in Lats1/2 DKO cells. To further examine the role of Lats1/2 in Wnt signaling, we tested Lats1/2 DKO MEFs. In wild-type (WT) MEFs, Wnt3a increased TAZ and β-catenin protein levels. However, in Lats1/2 DKO cells, Wnt3a had no effect on TAZ, whereas β-catenin accumulation was retained (Figure 2J). In vitro kinase assay using purified YAP protein as a substrate showed that Lats1 immunoprecipitated from FZD1-expressing cells displayed a significantly lower kinase activity (Figure 2K). Thus, our data suggest that FZD1 activates YAP/TAZ by inhibiting Lats kinase activity via the alternative Wnt pathway. Collectively, we propose that the alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ signaling axis consists of the following components: Wnt-FZD/ROR-Gα12/13-Rho GTPases-Lats1/2-YAP/TAZ (Figure 2L). Unlike Wnt5a/b and FZD/ROR, Wnt3a stimulation activates both YAP/TAZ and β-catenin. Previous reports showed that the destruction complex regulates YAP/TAZ degradation via Wnt/β-catenin signaling (Azzolin et al., 2014Azzolin L. Panciera T. Soligo S. Enzo E. Bicciato S. Dupont S. Bresolin S. Frasson C. Basso G.

To further investigate whether Wnt/β-catenin signaling is involved in Wnt3a-induced YAP/TAZ activation, we generated knockout cell lines of LRP5/6, which are indispensible co-receptors for Wnt/β-catenin signaling. As expected, deletion of LRP5/6 completely abolished β-catenin activation and target gene induction (Axin2) by Wnt3a (Figures 3A–3D and S3A). Strikingly, LRP5/6 DKO did not affect Wnt3a-induced YAP/TAZ activation or target gene expression (Ctgf) (Figures 3A–3D). FZD1-induced YAP/TAZ activation was also retained in LRP5/6 DKO or β-catenin KO cells (Figure S3B). Moreover, in β-catenin KO cells, YAP/TAZ basal levels and regulation were intact (Figure S3C). These results unambiguously show that LRP5/6 and β-catenin, hence canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, are dispensable for the alternative Wnt-YAP/TAZ signaling axis.Figure S3FZD1 Activates YAP/TAZ Independent of LRP5/6 and β-Catenin, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) Knockout of LRP5/6 or β-catenin impairs Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2132886417,"Compensatory proliferation triggered by hepatocyte loss is required for liver regeneration and maintenance but also promotes development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Despite extensive investigation, the cells responsible for hepatocyte restoration or HCC development remain poorly characterized. We used genetic lineage tracing to identify cells responsible for hepatocyte replenishment following chronic liver injury and queried their roles in three distinct HCC models. We found that a pre-existing population of periportal hepatocytes, located in the portal triads of healthy livers and expressing low amounts of Sox9 and other bile-duct-enriched genes, undergo extensive proliferation and replenish liver mass after chronic hepatocyte-depleting injuries. Despite their high regenerative potential, these so-called hybrid hepatocytes do not give rise to HCC in chronically injured livers and thus represent a unique way to restore tissue function and avoid tumorigenesis. This specialized set of pre-existing differentiated cells may be highly suitable for cell-based therapy of chronic hepatocyte-depleting disorders."

Though it is associated with infectious mononucleosis and ∼200,000 cancers annually worldwide, a vaccine is not available. The major target of immunity is EBV glycoprotein 350/220 (gp350) that mediates attachment to B cells through complement receptor 2 (CR2/CD21). Here, we created self-assembling nanoparticles that displayed different domains of gp350 in a symmetric array. By focusing presentation of the CR2-binding domain on nanoparticles, potent neutralizing antibodies were elicited in mice and non-human primates. The structurally designed nanoparticle vaccine increased neutralization 10- to 100-fold compared to soluble gp350 by targeting a functionally conserved site of vulnerability, improving vaccine-induced protection in a mouse model. This rational approach to EBV vaccine design elicited potent neutralizing antibody responses by arrayed presentation of a conserved viral entry domain, a strategy that can be applied to other viruses.PaperClip/cms/asset/bea3ad0e-ab73-450a-a517-3b2209e3b343/mmc3.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 3.68 MB) Download audio"

Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated a genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the 2013-2015 EVD epidemic is fueled by human-to-human transmissions, LASV infections mainly result from reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of LASV across West Africa and show that this migration was accompanied by changes in LASV genome abundance, fatality rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W1681696483,"Signaling mechanisms underlying self-renewal of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are poorly understood, and identifying pathways specifically active in LSCs could provide opportunities for therapeutic intervention. T-cell immunoglobin mucin-3 (TIM-3) is expressed on the surface of LSCs in many types of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but not on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Here, we show that TIM-3 and its ligand, galectin-9 (Gal-9), constitute an autocrine loop critical for LSC self-renewal and development of human AML. Serum Gal-9 levels were significantly elevated in AML patients and in mice xenografted with primary human AML samples, and neutralization of Gal-9 inhibited xenogeneic reconstitution of human AML. Gal-9-mediated stimulation of TIM-3 co-activated NF-κB and β-catenin signaling, pathways known to promote LSC self-renewal. These changes were further associated with leukemic transformation of a variety of pre-leukemic disorders and together highlight that targeting the TIM-3/Gal-9 autocrine loop could be a useful strategy for treating myeloid leukemias."
https://openalex.org/W1694587304,"The control of promoter-proximal pausing and the release of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a widely used mechanism for regulating gene expression in metazoans, especially for genes that respond to environmental and developmental cues. Here, we identify that Pol-II-associated factor 1 (PAF1) possesses an evolutionarily conserved function in metazoans in the regulation of promoter-proximal pausing. Reduction in PAF1 levels leads to an increased release of paused Pol II into gene bodies at thousands of genes. PAF1 depletion results in increased nascent and mature transcripts and increased levels of phosphorylation of Pol II's C-terminal domain on serine 2 (Ser2P). These changes can be explained by the recruitment of the Ser2P kinase super elongation complex (SEC) effecting increased release of paused Pol II into productive elongation, thus establishing PAF1 as a regulator of promoter-proximal pausing by Pol II."

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) and schizophrenia impose major disease burdens. Recent advances revealed a complex genetic landscape in neuropsychiatric disorders (reviewed in Murdoch and State, 2013Murdoch J.D. State M.W.

However, many of these mutations are so rare that their association with a particular disease was not statistically significant. Thus it often remained unclear whether a particular mutation was directly related to a specific disorder, and whether haploinsufficiency of a gene actually produces a direct functional impairment. Several candidate ASD genes encode proteins involved in synapse development and/or function. Among these, NRXN1 was significantly associated with both ASDs and schizophrenia in many studies (reviewed in Südhof, 2008Südhof T.C. Neuroligins and neurexins link synaptic function to cognitive disease.Nature. 2008; 455: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar, Doherty et al., 2012Doherty J.L. O’Donovan M.C. Owen M.J.

Balance within the Neurexin Trans-Synaptic Connexus Stabilizes Behavioral Control.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2014; 8: 52Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The NRXN1 gene encodes neurexin-1, a presynaptic cell-adhesion molecule that binds to postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecules such as neuroligins and LRRTMs, which were also associated with ASDs or schizophrenia. Most NRXN1 mutations are heterozygous copy number variations (CNVs) that delete only NRXN1 due to the large size of the NRXN1 gene, while missense and truncation mutations are less frequent (for recent papers, see Enggaard Hoeffding et al., 2014Enggaard Hoeffding L.K.

Although NRXN1 gene mutations are rare (∼0.18% of schizophrenia patients; Rees et al., 2014Rees E. Walters J.T. Georgieva L. Isles A.R. Chambert K.D. Richards A.L. Mahoney-Davies G. Legge S.E.

Psychiatry. 2014; 204: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), this frequency translates into thousands of patients. As a result, NRXN1 mutations at present represent the most frequent single-gene mutation in schizophrenia. Moreover, NRXN1 gene polymorphisms have been associated with differential responses to antipsychotic medication in schizophrenia (Souza et al., 2010Souza R.P. Meltzer H.Y. Lieberman J.A. Le Foll B.

However, the effects of heterozygous NRXN1 mutations on synaptic transmission in human neurons are unknown. Neurexin-1 is an evolutionarily conserved presynaptic cell-adhesion molecule (Ushkaryov et al., 1992Ushkaryov Y.A. Petrenko A.G. Geppert M. Südhof T.C.

Moreover, neurexins are alternatively spliced at six canonical sites, generating >1,000 protein isoforms (Ullrich et al., 1995Ullrich B. Ushkaryov Y.A. Südhof T.C.

Triple Nrxn1α/2α/3α knockout (KO) mice exhibit severe impairments in synaptic transmission and die at birth (Missler et al., 2003Missler M. Zhang W. Rohlmann A. Kattenstroth G. Hammer R.E. Gottmann K.

Recordings in acute hippocampal slices revealed discrete changes in synaptic transmission, but not neurotransmitter release, in homozygous Nrxn1α KO mice (Etherton et al., 2009Etherton M.R. Blaiss C.A. Powell C.M. Südhof T.C. Mouse neurexin-1α deletion causes correlated electrophysiological and behavioral changes consistent with cognitive impairments.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

No studies analyzing cultured neurons from either homo- or heterozygous Nrxn1α or Nrxn1b KO mice are available, and the role of specifically NRXN1 in synaptic transmission remains unclear. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), it has become feasible to analyze neurons from patient-derived iPSCs. Multiple studies have proved the utility of this approach (reviewed in Hanna et al., 2010Hanna J.H. Saha K. Jaenisch R.

However, many ASD- and schizophrenia-associated mutations exhibit incomplete penetrance, suggesting that genetic background effects significantly influence the clinical presentation and could contribute to the observed phenotypes. This issue is particularly relevant for NRXN1 mutations, which have been associated with several different neuropsychiatric disorders (Ching et al., 2010Ching M.S. Shen Y. Tan W.H. Jeste S.S.

Here we assessed the functional significance of a heterozygous disease-associated mutation on human neurons by introducing heterozygous conditional NRXN1 mutations into human embryonic stem cells (ESCs). This approach allowed us to analyze the functional effects of NRXN1 mutations on synaptic transmission in neurons derived from the mutant ESCs. We found that heterozygous loss-of-function NRXN1 mutations had no effect on neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis, but they severely impaired neurotransmitter release in a stimulus-dependent pattern. This phenotype was specific to human neurons as mouse Nrxn1α mutations exhibited no phenotype in comparable experiments. Moreover, NRXN1 mutations increased the levels of CASK, a synaptic membrane associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) that binds to neurexin-1 (Hata et al., 1996Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. CASK: a novel dlg/PSD95 homolog with an N-terminal calmodulin-dependent protein kinase domain identified by interaction with neurexins.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that heterozygous NRXN1 mutations have profound but selective effects on synaptic transmission, demonstrating a haploinsufficiency phenotype in human cells and suggesting a potential mechanism for the role of NRXN1 mutations in ASD and schizophrenia pathogenesis. Although hundreds of ASD and schizophrenia cases with heterozygous NRXN1 mutations have been described and constitutive mouse mutants for Nrxn1α (which encodes the major transcript of the Nrxn1 locus) were reported, no functional analyses of cultured neurons from hetero- or homozygous Nrxn1α KO mice are available, and no mouse mutants of the entire Nrxn1 locus were described. The only available data are from slice physiology experiments suggesting a small impairment in synaptic transmission in homozygous Nrxn1α KO mice (Etherton et al., 2009Etherton M.R. Blaiss C.A.

Thus, it is unknown whether heterozygous or homozygous Nrxn1 mutations in mice produce a synaptic or non-synaptic neuronal phenotype. To address this gap in our understanding, we analyzed cortical neurons cultured from littermate wild-type and heterozygous and homozygous Nrxn1α KO mice. However, we detected no change in spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) or action-potential evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in hetero- or homozygous Nrxn1α KO neurons (Figure S1). These results suggest that Nrxn1α is not essential for excitatory synaptic transmission in cultured mouse cortical neurons, but they do not rule out the possibility of a more severe human-specific effect. Thus, to test whether NRXN1 mutations may potentially have a more severe phenotypic effect in human neurons than in mouse neurons, we used recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) to introduce conditional mutations into the NRXN1 gene in human H1 ESCs (Kohli et al., 2004Kohli M. Rago C. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Facile methods for generating human somatic cell gene knockouts using recombinant adeno-associated viruses.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e3Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We separately introduced two different NRXN1 mutations and obtained correctly targeted clones with recombination frequencies of 5%–10% (correct clones/total clones), verified by PCR screening and Southern blot analysis (Figures 1A and S2). Both mutations produce loss-of-function alleles (see below) and control for each other. For the first of the two NRXN1 mutations (the conditional knockout [cKO]), we flanked exon 19 with loxP sites. Exon 19 is the first exon that is shared by all NRXN1 transcripts (Tabuchi and Südhof, 2002Tabuchi K. Südhof T.C. Structure and evolution of neurexin genes: insight into the mechanism of alternative splicing.Genomics. 2002; 79: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After homologous recombination, the mutated NRXN1 allele carries a selectable marker surrounded by FRT sites and loxP sites that flank both exon 19 and the selectable marker (Figure 1A). Flp-recombinase deletes the selectable marker, allowing wild-type expression of neurexin-1 (control), while Cre-recombinase deletes exon 19, disrupting the reading frame of the NRXN1 mRNA and blocking NRXN1 expression (KO; Figure 1B). Because there are no working antibodies that specifically detect neurexin-1 protein in human cells, we pursued a second NRXN1 mutagenesis strategy that introduces an epitope tag into neurexin-1 and additionally generates a conditional loss-of-function mutation. In this second mutation (referred to as conditional truncation [cTr]), we inserted into exon 24 (Tabuchi and Südhof, 2002Tabuchi K. Südhof T.C. Structure and evolution of neurexin genes: insight into the mechanism of alternative splicing.Genomics. 2002; 79: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) a cassette containing tandem HA epitopes, a loxP site, a stop codon, and a polyadenylation signal, followed by an FRT-flanked selectable marker (a puromycin resistance cassette) and another loxP site (Figure 1A). Flp-recombinase deletes the selectable marker but retains the stop codon, producing a truncated HA-tagged neurexin-1 protein. Cre-recombinase, conversely, generates a control NRXN1 allele encoding HA-tagged full-length neurexin-1 (Figure 1B). The inserted stop codon in the cTr mutation mimics a de novo mutation (G1402fs) found in a schizophrenia patient that truncates neurexin-1 protein 25 residues C-terminal to the cTr mutation (Gauthier et al., 2011Gauthier J. Siddiqui T.J. Huashan P. Yokomaku D. Hamdan F.F. Champagne N. Lapointe M. Spiegelman D. Noreau A. Lafrenière R.G. et al.Truncating mutations in NRXN2 and NRXN1 in autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.Hum. Genet. 2011; 130: 563-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We converted ESCs with conditional NRXN1 mutations into induced neurons (iN cells) using forced expression of the transcription factor Ngn2 (Figure 1B). This method produces a homogenous, well-characterized population of excitatory cortical neurons (Zhang et al., 2013Zhang Y. Pak C. Han Y. Ahlenius H. Zhang Z. Chanda S. Marro S. Patzke C. Acuna C. Covy J. et al.Rapid single-step induction of functional neurons from human pluripotent stem cells.Neuron. 2013; 78: 785-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). During iN cell differentiation, we co-expressed the appropriate recombinases with Ngn2 in the ESCs to produce precisely matching sets of control and heterozygous NRXN1 mutant iN cells (Figure 1B). We analyzed iN cells derived from one cKO mutant and two cTr mutant ESC clones. We observed efficient conversion of all genetically altered ESCs into iN cells, with expression of recombinases in virtually 100% of iN cells (Figure S3). mRNA measurements demonstrated that the cKO reduces NRXN1 mRNA levels approximately 2-fold (Figure 1C). No effect of NRXN1 mutations on neuronal differentiation was detected, as indicated by unchanged dendritic and cellular morphological properties (Figures 1D, 1E, and S4). Immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting showed that in control iN cells from cTr mutant ESCs (i.e., Cre-recombinase treated cTr iN cells), full-length HA-tagged neurexin-1 was abundantly expressed and displayed on the neuronal surface (Figure S3). Without Cre-recombinase treatment (i.e., in cTr iN cells treated with inactive Cre-recombinase), HA-tagged full-length or truncated neurexin-1 was neither detectable by immunocytochemistry on the neuronal surface nor observed by immunoblotting in the cell lysate or the media. Thus, full-length HA-tagged neurexin-1 appears to be trafficked normally to the neuronal cell surface in control cTr neurons, whereas truncated HA-tagged neurexin-1 is unstable and degraded in mutant cTr neurons. Similarly, mRNA measurements in control and mutant neurons from NRXN1 cKO ESCs failed to detect the mutant mRNA despite robust expression of wild-type mRNA, suggesting that the mutant mRNA is rapidly degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (Figure S3). Next, we performed electrophysiological recordings in matched control and NRXN1 mutant iN cells to measure fundamental parameters, such as membrane capacitance, input resistance, resting membrane potential, neuronal excitability, and voltage-dependent Na+ and K+ currents responsible for action potential generation. We detected no differences between corresponding NRXN1 mutant and control neurons in either cKO- or cTr mutant NRXN1 iN cells (Figures 2 and S5). These data suggest that loss of one NRXN1 allele does not lead to major changes in the measured non-synaptic properties of human neurons. We next asked whether heterozygous NRXN1 mutations alter synapse formation or function, again monitoring the effects of both mutations under precisely controlled conditions. We first measured mEPSCs. Strikingly, we found that both the cTr and the cKO NRXN1 mutation caused an ∼2-fold decrease in mEPSC frequency without altering the mEPSC amplitude (Figures 3A–3C). A change in mEPSC frequency suggests a presynaptic alteration in the number of synapses and/or their release probability. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we performed a morphological analysis of synapse numbers and dendritic arborization in NRXN1 mutant iN cells. We sparsely labeled control and NRXN1 mutant iN cells with lentiviruses expressing fluorescent markers (EGFP or TdTomato), immunostained the neurons for synapsin-1, and examined the size and arborization of dendrites as well as the density, size, and labeling intensity of synapses (Figures 3D, 3E, and S6). Neither NRXN1 mutation altered any of these parameters, suggesting that the NRXN1 mutations did not impair neuronal development or synaptogenesis. Thus, the decreased mEPSC frequency observed in NRXN1 mutant neurons is not due to a decrease in synapse numbers. To analyze synaptic function in heterozygous NRXN1 mutant neurons in more detail, we measured evoked EPSCs mediated by AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs). Consistent with the decrease in mEPSC frequency, we observed an ∼2-fold decrease in EPSC amplitude in cTr and cKO mutant neurons compared to corresponding control neurons (Figure 4A). This surprisingly large effect was not due to the viral expression of recombinases because the two different NRXN1 mutations depend on different recombinases (Figure 1A) and expression of various recombinases in naive human neurons had no effect on EPSC amplitudes (Figure S7). The decreased mEPSC frequency, normal synapse numbers, and reduced evoked EPSC amplitudes suggest that the NRXN1 mutations decrease neurotransmitter release probability. To further explore this possibility, we analyzed short-term synaptic plasticity, which represents an indirect measure of release probability (Regehr, 2012Regehr W.G. Short-term presynaptic plasticity.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a005702Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We found that both heterozygous NRXN1 mutations significantly decreased only the first EPSC response during a 10 Hz stimulus train (Figure 4B). As a result, normalized plots of EPSCs as a function of stimulus number showed that mutant neurons exhibited significantly less synaptic depression. In accordance with the decreases in mEPSC frequency and EPSC amplitude, this finding strongly indicates that conditional NRXN1 mutations cause a selective large decrease in the initial neurotransmitter release probability in human neurons, but not in the release probability overall. This decrease is not due to changes in the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles, which can be measured as the cumulative EPSC elicited by a hypertonic sucrose stimulus (Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996Rosenmund C. Stevens C.F. Definition of the readily releasable pool of vesicles at hippocampal synapses.Neuron. 1996; 16: 1197-1207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar), because we detected no change in the RRP size between control and heterozygous NRXN1 mutant neurons (Figure 4C). Importantly, the two different mutations (the “cTr” and “cKO” mutations; Figure 1A) exhibited indistinguishable phenotypes. Our analyses of NRXN1 mutations used the iN cell protocol for generating neurons (Zhang et al., 2013Zhang Y. Pak C. Han Y. Ahlenius H. Zhang Z. Chanda S. Marro S. Patzke C. Acuna C.

Because the phenotype of heterozygous NRXN1 mutations in iN cells was surprisingly severe when compared to the lack of a phenotype in similar mouse mutants (Figure S1), we asked whether this phenotype may be specific to neurons produced by the iN cell method.

https://openalex.org/W1565619177,"To study the function of Rli1/ABCE1 in vivo, we used ribosome profiling and biochemistry to characterize its contribution to ribosome recycling. When Rli1 levels were diminished, 80S ribosomes accumulated both at stop codons and in the adjoining 3'UTRs of most mRNAs. Frequently, these ribosomes reinitiated translation without the need for a canonical start codon, as small peptide products predicted by 3'UTR ribosome occupancy in all three reading frames were confirmed by western analysis and mass spectrometry. Eliminating the ribosome-rescue factor Dom34 dramatically increased 3'UTR ribosome occupancy in Rli1 depleted cells, indicating that Dom34 clears the bulk of unrecycled ribosomes. Thus, Rli1 is crucial for ribosome recycling in vivo and controls ribosome homeostasis. 3'UTR translation occurs in wild-type cells as well, and observations of elevated 3'UTR ribosomes during stress suggest that modulating recycling and reinitiation is involved in responding to environmental changes."

Here, we find that two distinctly timed electrical drives collaborate to impose rhythmicity on Drosophila clock neurons. In the morning, a voltage-independent sodium conductance via the NA/NALCN ion channel depolarizes these neurons. This current is driven by the rhythmic expression of NCA localization factor-1, linking the molecular clock to ion channel function. In the evening, basal potassium currents peak to silence clock neurons. Remarkably, daily antiphase cycles of sodium and potassium currents also drive mouse clock neuron rhythms. Thus, we reveal an evolutionarily ancient strategy for the neural mechanisms that govern daily sleep and wake."

Here, we have developed HIPMap, a high-precision, high-throughput, automated fluorescent in situ hybridization imaging pipeline, for mapping of the spatial location of genome regions at large scale. High-throughput imaging position mapping (HIPMap) enabled an unbiased siRNA screen for factors involved in genome organization in human cells. We identify 50 cellular factors required for proper positioning of a set of functionally diverse genomic loci. Positioning factors include chromatin remodelers, histone modifiers, and nuclear envelope and pore proteins. Components of the replication and post-replication chromatin re-assembly machinery are prominently represented among positioning factors, and timely progression of cells through replication, but not mitosis, is required for correct gene positioning. Our results establish a method for the large-scale mapping of genome locations and have led to the identification of a compendium of cellular factors involved in spatial genome organization."
https://openalex.org/W2123561809,"Chronic infection with Plasmodium falciparum was epidemiologically associated with endemic Burkitt's lymphoma, a mature B cell cancer characterized by chromosome translocation between the c-myc oncogene and Igh, over 50 years ago. Whether infection promotes B cell lymphoma, and if so by which mechanism, remains unknown. To investigate the relationship between parasitic disease and lymphomagenesis, we used Plasmodium chabaudi (Pc) to produce chronic malaria infection in mice. Pc induces prolonged expansion of germinal centers (GCs), unique compartments in which B cells undergo rapid clonal expansion and express activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA mutator. GC B cells elicited during Pc infection suffer widespread DNA damage, leading to chromosome translocations. Although infection does not change the overall rate, it modifies lymphomagenesis to favor mature B cell lymphomas that are AID dependent and show chromosome translocations. Thus, malaria infection favors mature B cell cancers by eliciting protracted AID expression in GC B cells. PAPERCLIP."
https://openalex.org/W1157462478,"The histone demethylase JMJD1A, which controls gene expression by epigenetic regulation of H3K9 methylation marks, functions in diverse activities, including spermatogenesis, metabolism and stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we found that JMJD1A knockdown in prostate cancer cells antagonizes their proliferation and survival. Profiling array analyses revealed that JMJD1A-dependent genes function in cellular growth, proliferation and survival, and implicated that the c-Myc transcriptional network is deregulated following JMJD1A inhibition. Biochemical analyses confirmed that JMJD1A enhances c-Myc transcriptional activity by upregulating c-Myc expression levels. Mechanistically, JMJD1A activity promoted recruitment of androgen receptor (AR) to the c-Myc gene enhancer and induced H3K9 demethylation, increasing AR-dependent transcription of c-Myc mRNA. In parallel, we found that JMJD1A regulated c-Myc stability, likely by inhibiting HUWE1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase known to target degradation of several substrates including c-Myc. JMJD1A (wild type or mutant lacking histone demethylase activity) bound to HUWE1, attenuated HUWE1-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of c-Myc, increasing c-Myc protein levels. Furthermore, c-Myc knockdown in prostate cancer cells phenocopied effects of JMJD1A knockdown, and c-Myc re-expression in JMJD1A-knockdown cells partially rescued prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. c-Myc protein levels were positively correlated with those of JMJD1A in a subset of human prostate cancer specimens. Collectively, our findings identify a critical role for JMJD1A in regulating proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells by controlling c-Myc expression at transcriptional and post-translational levels."
https://openalex.org/W2360800897,"The transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) is upregulated in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and is a key regulator of the aberrant transcriptome characteristic of this disease. Here we show that IRF5 upregulation in HL is driven by transcriptional activation of a normally dormant endogenous retroviral LOR1a long terminal repeat (LTR) upstream of IRF5. Specifically, through screening of RNA-sequencing libraries, we detected LTR-IRF5 chimeric transcripts in multiple HL cell lines but not in normal B-cell controls. In HL, the LTR was in an open and hypomethylated epigenetic state, and we further show the LTR is the site of transcriptional initiation. Among HL cell lines, usage of the LTR promoter strongly correlates with overall levels of IRF5 mRNA and protein, indicating that LTR transcriptional awakening is a major contributor to IRF5 upregulation in HL. Taken together, oncogenic IRF5 overexpression in HL is the result of a specific LTR transcriptional activation. We propose that such LTR derepression is a distinct mechanism of oncogene activation (‘onco-exaptation’), and that such a mechanism warrants further investigation in molecular and cancer research."

Markedly reduced GBA activity is associated with severe manifestations of Gaucher disease including neurological involvement. Mutations in the GBA gene have recently also been identified as major genetic risk factor for Parkinsonism. Disturbed metabolism of GlcCer may therefore play a role in neuropathology. Besides lysosomal GBA, cells also contain a non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase (GBA2). Given that the two β-glucosidases share substrates, we speculated that over-activity of GBA2 during severe GBA impairment might influence neuropathology. This hypothesis was studied in Niemann-Pick type C (Npc1-/-) mice showing secondary deficiency in GBA in various tissues. Here we report that GBA2 activity is indeed increased in the brain of Npc1-/- mice. We found that GBA2 is particularly abundant in Purkinje cells (PCs), one of the most affected neuronal populations in NPC disease. Inhibiting GBA2 in Npc1-/- mice with a brain-permeable low nanomolar inhibitor significantly improved motor coordination and extended lifespan in the absence of correction in cholesterol and ganglioside abnormalities. This trend was recapitulated, although not to full extent, by introducing a genetic loss of GBA2 in Npc1-/- mice. Our findings point to GBA2 activity as therapeutic target in NPC."
https://openalex.org/W1139788413,"Melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer and successful treatment of metastatic melanoma remains challenging. BRAF/MEK inhibitors only show a temporary benefit due to rapid occurrence of resistance, whereas immunotherapy is mainly effective in selected subsets of patients. Thus, there is a need to identify new targets to improve treatment of metastatic melanoma. To this extent, we searched for markers that are elevated in melanoma and are under regulation of potentially druggable enzymes. Here, we show that the pro-proliferative transcription factor FOXM1 is elevated and activated in malignant melanoma. FOXM1 activity correlated with expression of the enzyme Pin1, which we found to be indicative of a poor prognosis. In functional experiments, Pin1 proved to be a main regulator of FOXM1 activity through MEK-dependent physical regulation during the cell cycle. The Pin1-FOXM1 interaction was enhanced by BRAFV600E, the driver oncogene in the majority of melanomas, and in extrapolation of the correlation data, interference with\ Pin1 in BRAFV600E-driven metastatic melanoma cells impaired both FOXM1 activity and cell survival. Importantly, cell-permeable Pin1-FOXM1-blocking peptides repressed the proliferation of melanoma cells in freshly isolated human metastatic melanoma ex vivo and in three-dimensional-cultured patient-derived melanoids. When combined with the BRAFV600E-inhibitor PLX4032 a robust repression in melanoid viability was obtained, establishing preclinical value of patient-derived melanoids for prognostic use of drug sensitivity and further underscoring the beneficial effect of Pin1-FOXM1 inhibitory peptides as anti-melanoma drugs.

Metastatic bone lesion development was compared by analysis of both lesion number and area. We found that LysM(Cre)/Tgfbr2 knockout significantly decreased MDA-MB-231 bone lesion development in both the cardiac and tibial injection models. LysM(Cre)/Tgfbr2 knockout inhibited the tumor cell proliferation, angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis of the metastatic bones. Cytokine array analysis showed that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was downregulated in MDA-MB-231-injected tibiae from the LysM(Cre)/Tgfbr2 KO group, and intravenous injection of the recombinant bFGF to LysM(Cre)/Tgfbr2 KO mice rescued the inhibited metastatic bone lesion development. The mechanism by which bFGF rescued the bone lesion development was by promotion of tumor cell proliferation through the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-cFos pathway after binding to the FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1). Consistent with animal studies, we found that in human BCa bone metastatic tissues, TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) and p-Smad2 were expressed in osteoclasts and tumor cells, and were correlated with the expression of FGFR1.

https://openalex.org/W1800852982,"Successful point-of-care testing, namely ensuring the completion of the test and treat cycle in the same encounter, has immense potential to reduce diagnostic and treatment delays, and impact patient outcomes. However, having rapid tests is not enough, as many barriers may prevent their successful implementation in point-of-care testing programs. Qualitative research on diagnostic practices may help identify such barriers across different points of care in health systems.In this exploratory qualitative study, we conducted 78 semi-structured interviews and 13 focus group discussions in an urban and rural area of Karnataka, India, with healthcare providers (doctors, nurses, specialists, traditional healers, and informal providers), patients, community health workers, test manufacturers, laboratory technicians, program managers and policy-makers. Participants were purposively sampled to represent settings of hospitals, peripheral labs, clinics, communities and homes, in both the public and private sectors.In the Indian context, the onus is on the patient to ensure successful point-of-care testing across homes, clinics, labs and hospitals, amidst uncoordinated providers with divergent and often competing practices, in settings lacking material, money and human resources. We identified three overarching themes affecting point-of-care testing: the main theme is 'relationships' among providers and between providers and patients, influenced by the cross-cutting theme of 'infrastructure'. Challenges with both result in 'modified practices' often favouring empirical (symptomatic) treatment over treatment guided by testing.Even if tests can be conducted on the spot and infrastructure challenges have been resolved, relationships among providers and between patients and providers are crucial for successful point-of-care testing. Furthermore, these barriers do not act in isolation, but are interlinked and need to be examined as such. Also, a test alone has only limited power to overcome those difficulties. Test developers, policy-makers, healthcare providers and funders need to use these insights in overcoming barriers to point-of-care testing programs."
https://openalex.org/W1756855932,"Altered immune function has been demonstrated in astronauts during spaceflights dating back to Apollo and Skylab; this could be a major barrier to long-term space exploration. We tested the hypothesis that spaceflight causes changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression. Human leukocytes were stimulated with mitogens on board the International Space Station using an onboard normal gravity control. Bioinformatics showed that miR-21 was significantly up-regulated 2-fold during early T-cell activation in normal gravity, and gene expression was suppressed under microgravity. This was confirmed using quantitative real-time PCR (n = 4). This is the first report that spaceflight regulates miRNA expression. Global microarray analysis showed significant (P < 0.05) suppression of 85 genes under microgravity conditions compared to normal gravity samples. EGR3, FASLG, BTG2, SPRY2, and TAGAP are biologically confirmed targets and are co-up-regulated with miR-21. These genes share common promoter regions with pre-mir-21; as the miR-21 matures and accumulates, it most likely will inhibit translation of its target genes and limit the immune response. These data suggest that gravity regulates T-cell activation not only by transcription promotion but also by blocking translation via noncoding RNA mechanisms. Moreover, this study suggests that T-cell activation itself may induce a sequence of gene expressions that is self-limited by miR-21."

Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) may contribute to escape from VEGFR2 inhibition. We evaluated the efficacy of sorafenib, a broad spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR2 and PDGFR as well as RET and RAF1, in patients with metastatic chemotherapy refractory esophageal and GE junction cancer.This phase II trial of sorafenib 400 mg twice daily enrolled chemotherapy refractory patients with metastatic esophageal and GE junction cancer with primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS) rate at two months. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate and toxicity.Among 34 patients, 8 week Kaplan-Meier estimated PFS was 61% (90%CI 45 to 73%). Median PFS is 3.6 months (95% CI 1.8 to 3.9 months), with median overall survival OS 9.7 months (95% CI 5.9 to 11.6 months). Grade 3 toxicities were uncommon and included hand foot skin reaction, rash, dehydration and fatigue. One patient (3%) with ongoing complete response and remains on trial for over 5 years. Whole exome sequencing of this tumor revealed mutations in many cancer-associated genes including ARID1A, PIK3CA, and TP53, and focal amplifications of HMGA2 and MET.Sorafenib therapy results in disease stabilization and encouraging PFS in patients with refractory esophageal and GE junction cancer.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00917462."
https://openalex.org/W2100529316,"α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are abundantly expressed throughout the central nervous system and are thought to be the primary target of nicotine, the main addictive substance in cigarette smoking. Understanding the mechanisms by which these receptors are regulated may assist in developing compounds to selectively interfere with nicotine addiction. Here we report previously unrecognized modulatory properties of members of the Ly6 protein family on α4β2 nAChRs. Using a FRET-based Ca2+ flux assay, we found that the maximum response of α4β2 receptors to agonist was strongly inhibited by Ly6h and Lynx2 but potentiated by Ly6g6e. The mechanisms underlying these opposing effects appear to be fundamentally distinct. Receptor inhibition by Lynx2 was accompanied by suppression of α4β2 expression at the cell surface, even when assays were preceded by chronic exposure of cells to an established chaperone, nicotine. Receptor inhibition by Lynx2 also was resistant to pretreatment with extracellular phospholipase C, which cleaves lipid moieties like those that attach Ly6 proteins to the plasma membrane. In contrast, potentiation of α4β2 activity by Ly6g6e was readily reversible by pretreatment with phospholipase C. Potentiation was also accompanied by slowing of receptor desensitization and an increase in peak currents. Collectively our data support roles for Lynx2 and Ly6g6e in intracellular trafficking and allosteric potentiation of α4β2 nAChRs, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2203632999,"In both humans with long-standing ulcerative colitis and mouse models of colitis-associated carcinogenesis (CAC), tumors develop predominantly in the distal part of the large intestine but the biological basis of this intriguing pathology remains unknown. Herein we report intrinsic differences in gene expression between proximal and distal colon in the mouse, which are augmented during dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)/azoxymethane (AOM)-induced CAC. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes identified discrete biological pathways operating in proximal vs distal intestine and revealed a cluster of genes involved in lipid metabolism to be associated with the disease-resistant proximal colon. Guided by this finding, we have further interrogated the expression and function of one of these genes, apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I), a major component of high-density lipoprotein. We show that ApoA-I is expressed at higher levels in the proximal compared with the distal part of the colon and its ablation in mice results in exaggerated DSS-induced colitis and disruption of epithelial architecture in larger areas of the large intestine. Conversely, treatment with an ApoA-I mimetic peptide ameliorated the phenotypic, histopathological and inflammatory manifestations of the disease. Genetic interference with ApoA-I levels in vivo impacted on the number, size and distribution of AOM/DSS-induced colon tumors. Mechanistically, ApoA-I was found to modulate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and nuclear factor-κB activation in response to the bacterial product lipopolysaccharide with concomitant impairment in the production of the pathogenic cytokine interleukin-6. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel protective role for ApoA-I in colitis and CAC and unravel an unprecedented link between lipid metabolic processes and intestinal pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1767786877,"Members of genus Bifidobacterium are Gram-positive bacteria, representing a large part of the human infant microbiota and moderately common in adults. However, our knowledge about their diversity, intraspecific phylogeny and long-term persistence in humans is still limited. Bifidobacterium longum is generally considered to be the most common and prevalent species in the intestinal microbiota. In this work we studied whole genome sequences of 28 strains of B. longum, including 8 sequences described in this paper. Part of these strains were isolated from healthy children during a long observation period (up to 10 years between isolation from the same patient). The three known subspecies (longum, infantis and suis) could be clearly divided using sequence-based phylogenetic methods, gene content and the average nucleotide identity. The profiles of glycoside hydrolase genes reflected the different ecological specializations of these three subspecies. The high impact of horizontal gene transfer on genomic diversity was observed, which is possibly due to a large number of prophages and rapidly spreading plasmids. The pan-genome characteristics of the subspecies longum corresponded to the open pan-genome model. While the major part of the strain-specific genetic loci represented transposons and phage-derived regions, a large number of cell envelope synthesis genes were also observed within this category, representing high variability of cell surface molecules. We observed the cases of isolation of high genetically similar strains of B. longum from the same patients after long periods of time, however, we didn't succeed in the isolation of genetically identical bacteria: a fact, reflecting the high plasticity of microbiota in children."
https://openalex.org/W1204481820,"Macrophages respond to the Th2 cytokine IL-4 with elevated expression of arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase (ALOX15). Although IL-4 signaling elicits anti-inflammatory responses, 15-lipoxygenase may either support or inhibit inflammatory processes in a context-dependent manner. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a metabolic sensor/regulator that supports an anti-inflammatory macrophage phenotype. How AMPK activation is linked to IL-4-elicited gene signatures remains unexplored. Using primary human macrophages stimulated with IL-4, we observed elevated ALOX15 mRNA and protein expression, which was attenuated by AMPK activation. AMPK activators, e.g. phenformin and aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside inhibited IL-4-evoked activation of STAT3 while leaving activation of STAT6 and induction of typical IL-4-responsive genes intact. In addition, phenformin prevented IL-4-induced association of STAT6 and Lys-9 acetylation of histone H3 at the ALOX15 promoter. Activating AMPK abolished cellular production of 15-lipoxygenase arachidonic acid metabolites in IL-4-stimulated macrophages, which was mimicked by ALOX15 knockdown. Finally, pretreatment of macrophages with IL-4 for 48 h increased the mRNA expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-12, CXCL9, and CXCL10 induced by subsequent stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. This response was attenuated by inhibition of ALOX15 or activation of AMPK during incubation with IL-4. In conclusion, limiting ALOX15 expression by AMPK may promote an anti-inflammatory phenotype of IL-4-stimulated human macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1946362544,"Transposons are ubiquitous genetic elements that drive genome rearrangements, evolution, and the spread of infectious disease and drug-resistance. Many transposons, such as Mu, Tn7, and IS21, require regulatory AAA+ ATPases for function. We use X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy to show that the ATPase subunit of IS21, IstB, assembles into a clamshell-shaped decamer that sandwiches DNA between two helical pentamers of ATP-associated AAA+ domains, sharply bending the duplex into a 180° U-turn. Biochemical studies corroborate key features of the structure and further show that the IS21 transposase, IstA, recognizes the IstB•DNA complex and promotes its disassembly by stimulating ATP hydrolysis. Collectively, these studies reveal a distinct manner of higher-order assembly and client engagement by a AAA+ ATPase and suggest a mechanistic model where IstB binding and subsequent DNA bending primes a selected insertion site for efficient transposition."
https://openalex.org/W2203908177,"Notch controls pancreatic differentiation during development and is reactivated in pancreatic cancer. In recent years, the importance of Notch signaling in pancreatic tumorigenesis has become increasingly evident; however, it remains unclear how Notch activities are regulated in this context. Here we report differential regulation of Notch receptors by Lunatic Fringe (Lfng), which encodes an O-fucosylpeptide 3-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase known to modify epidermal growth factor repeats in the Notch extracellular domain, during pathogenesis of Kras-induced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We show that Lfng is uniquely expressed in a subset of acinar cells in the adult pancreas. Deletion of Lfng in the Kras(LSL-G12D/+);Pdx1-Cre mouse model caused increased activation of Notch3 throughout PDAC initiation and progression, and Notch1 after the onset of disease, associated with marked upregulation of Notch target gene Hes1. Deletion of Lfng also resulted in accumulation of Aldh1-positive cell population. We found that loss of Lfng significantly accelerated Kras-initiated PDAC development and shortened survival of the PDAC mice. Interestingly, Lfng-deficient tumors showed a propensity for a poorly differentiated state with features of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Likewise, knockdown of LFNG in human PDAC cell lines caused elevated Notch activation, associated with either accelerated cell proliferation or expanded Aldh1-positive cell population. Deletion of Lfng resulted in downregulation of Tgfb1, Tgfb2 and Tgfbr2 expression in the wild-type pancreas at all ages examined, and in the Kras(LSL-G12D/+);Pdx1-Cre pancreas after PDAC onset, as well as reduced phospho-Smad2 levels in pancreatic tumors. We provide evidence that Lfng regulates transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling through Notch-mediated transcriptional repression of TGF-β pathway genes. Taken together, our results reveal a potent tumor-suppressive function for Lfng and crosstalk between Notch and TGF-β pathways in the pancreas, which provides new insight into initiation of PDAC and signals involved in disease progression."

In this study, first, it was revealed that Pin1 associates with any isoform of γ, but not with either the α or the β subunit, of AMPK. The association between Pin1 and the AMPK γ1 subunit is mediated by the WW domain of Pin1 and the Thr211-Pro-containing motif located in the CBS domain of the γ1 subunit. Importantly, overexpression of Pin1 suppressed AMPK phosphorylation in response to either 2-deoxyglucose or biguanide stimulation, whereas Pin1 knockdown by siRNAs or treatment with Pin1 inhibitors enhanced it. The experiments using recombinant Pin1, AMPK, LKB1, and PP2C proteins revealed that the protective effect of AMP against PP2C-induced AMPKα subunit dephosphorylation was markedly suppressed by the addition of Pin1. In good agreement with the in vitro data, the level of AMPK phosphorylation as well as the expressions of mitochondria-related genes, such as PGC-1α, which are known to be positively regulated by AMPK, were markedly higher with reduced triglyceride accumulation in the muscles of Pin1 KO mice as compared with controls. These findings suggest that Pin1 plays an important role in the pathogenic mechanisms underlying impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, functioning as a negative regulator of AMPK.

https://openalex.org/W1894384292,"Double cropping of wheat and maize is common on the North China Plain, but it provides limited income to rural households due to the small farm sizes in the region. Local farmers in Quzhou County have therefore innovated their production system by integration of watermelon as a companion cash crop into the system. We examine the economic performance and sustainability of this novel intercropping system using crop yield data from 2010 to 2012 and farm household survey data collected in 2012. Our results show that the gross margin of the intercropping system exceeded that of the double cropping system by more than 50% in 2012. Labor use in the intercropping system was more than three times that in double cropping. The lower returns per labor hour in intercropping, however, exceeded the average off-farm wage in the region by a significant margin. Nutrient surpluses and irrigation water use are significant larger under the intercropping system. We conclude that the novel wheat-maize/watermelon intercropping system contributes to rural poverty alleviation and household-level food security, by raising farm incomes and generating more employment, but needs further improvement to enhance its sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W1815965492,"Pollution in Southeast Asia is a major public energy problem and the cause of energy losses. A significant problem with respect to this type of pollution is that it decreases energy yield. In this study, two types of photovoltaic (PV) solar arrays were used to evaluate the effect of air pollution. The performance of two types of solar arrays were analysed in this research, namely, two units of a 1 kWp tracking flat photovoltaic (TFP) and two units of a 1 kWp fixed flat photovoltaic arrays (FFP). Data analysis was conducted on 2,190 samples at 30 min intervals from 01st June 2013, when both arrays were washed, until 30th June 2013. The performance was evaluated by using environmental data (irradiation, temperature, dust thickness, and air pollution index), power output, and energy yield. Multiple regression models were predicted in view of the environmental data and PV array output. Results showed that the fixed flat system was more affected by air pollution than the tracking flat plate. The contribution of this work is that it considers two types of photovoltaic arrays under the Southeast Asian pollution 2013."
https://openalex.org/W1933411690,"No-take marine protected areas (MPAs) are assumed to enhance fisheries catch via the ""spillover"" effect, where biomass is exported to adjacent exploited areas. Recent studies in spearfishing fisheries suggest that the spillover of gear-naïve individuals from protected to unprotected sites increases catch rates outside the boundaries of MPAs. Whether this is a widespread phenomenon that also holds for other gear types and species is unknown. In this study, we tested if the distance to a Mediterranean MPA predicted the degree of vulnerability to hook and line in four small-bodied coastal fish species. With the assistance of underwater video recording, we investigated the interaction effect of the distance to the boundary of an MPA and species type relative to the latency time to ingest a natural bait, which was considered as a surrogate of fish naïveté or vulnerability to fishing. Vulnerability to angling increased (i.e., latency time decreased) within and near the boundary of an MPA for an intrinsically highly catchable species (Serranus scriba), while it remained constant for an intrinsically uncatchable control species (Chromis chromis). While all of the individuals of S. scriba observed within the MPA and surrounding areas were in essence captured by angling gear, only one fifth of individuals in the far locations were captured. This supports the potential for the spillover of gear-naïve and consequently more vulnerable fish from no-take MPAs. Two other species initially characterized as intermediately catchable (Coris julis and Diplodus annularis) also had a shorter latency time in the vicinity of an MPA, but for these two cases the trend was not statistically significant. Overall, our results suggest that an MPA-induced naïveté effect may not be universal and may be confined to only intrinsically highly catchable fish species. This fact emphasizes the importance of considering the behavioural dimension when predicting the outcomes of MPAs, otherwise the effective contribution may be smaller than predicted for certain highly catchable species such as S. scriba."
https://openalex.org/W2163483195,"Dairy propionibacteria are actinomycetales found in various fermented food products. The main species, Propionibacterium freudenreichii, is generally recognized as safe and used both as probiotic and as cheese starter. Its probiotic efficacy tightly depends on its tolerance towards digestive stresses, which can be largely modulated by the ingested delivery vehicle. Indeed, tolerance of this bacterium is enhanced when it is consumed within a fermented dairy product, compared to a dried probiotic preparation. We investigated both stress tolerance and protein neosynthesis upon growth in i) chemically defined or ii) aqueous phase of Emmental cheeses. Although the same final population level was reached in both media, a slower growth and an enhanced survival of CIRM BIA 1 strain of P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii was observed in Emmental juice, compared to chemically defined medium. This was accompanied by differences in substrates used and products released as well as overexpression of various early stress adaptation proteins in Emmental juice, compared to chemically defined medium, implied in protein folding, in aspartate catabolism, in biosynthesis of valine, leucine and isoleucine, in pyruvate metabolism in citrate cycle, in the propionate metabolism, as well as in oxidoreductases. All these changes led to a higher digestive stress tolerance after growth in Emmental juice. Mechanisms of stress adaptation were induced in this environment, in accordance with enhanced survival. This opens perspectives for the use of hard and semi-hard cheeses as delivery vehicle for probiotics with enhanced efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W1143806046,"The Ras association domain family (RASSF) encodes several members with tumor-suppressive potentials. We aimed to investigate the biological function and clinical implication of RASSF10 in gastric cancer (GC). We found that RASSF10 was silenced in six of seven GC cell lines and in primary GC tissues, but was highly expressed in normal gastric tissues. The silence of RASSAF10 was mediated by promoter methylation as evaluated by bisulfite genomic sequencing. RASSF10 expression could be restored by demethylation treatment. A negative correlation between methylation and mRNA expression of RASSF10 was observed in 223 gastric samples of The Cancer Genome Atlas study (P<0.0001). Re-expression of RASSF10 in GC cell lines (AGS and MKN45) significantly suppressed cell viability, colony formation, migration and invasion, reduced cells in S phase, accumulated cells in G2 phase and induced cell apoptosis in vitro, and inhibited tumorigenicity in nude mice. These were confirmed by decreased expression of proliferation markers (proliferating cell nuclear antigen, p-CDC2 and p-CDC25) and increased apoptotic cascades (cleaved caspases-9, -8, -3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase). Conversely, RASSF10 knockdown in normal gastric cell line yielded an opposing effect. Co-immunoprecipitation combined with mass spectrometry analyses were performed to reveal the downstream effectors of RASSF10. The result revealed that glutathione S-transferase Pi 1 (GSTP1) was a direct cooperator of RASSF10. The tumor-suppressive effect of RASSF10 was partially mediated by cooperating with GSTP1 to deregulate Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway. Importantly, RASSF10 methylation was detected in 56.6% (98/173) of primary GCs and is an independent risk factor for poor survival of GC patients (P=0.001). In conclusions, RASSF10 functions as a tumor suppressor by cooperating with GSTP1 to deregulate JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 pathway in GC. Promoter methylation of RASSF10 is associated with poor survival of GC patients."

https://openalex.org/W2148799131,"Understanding human mobility is of vital importance for urban planning, epidemiology, and many other fields that aim to draw policies from the activities of humans in space. Despite recent availability of large scale data sets related to human mobility such as GPS traces, mobile phone data, etc., it is still true that such data sets represent a subsample of the population of interest, and then might give an incomplete picture of the entire population in question. Notwithstanding the abundant usage of such inherently limited data sets, the impact of sampling biases on mobility patterns is unclear -- we do not have methods available to reliably infer mobility information from a limited data set. Here, we investigate the effects of sampling using a data set of millions of taxi movements in New York City. On the one hand, we show that mobility patterns are highly stable once an appropriate simple rescaling is applied to the data, implying negligible loss of information due to subsampling over long time scales. On the other hand, contrasting an appropriate null model on the weighted network of vehicle flows reveals distinctive features which need to be accounted for. Accordingly, we formulate a ""supersampling"" methodology which allows us to reliably extrapolate mobility data from a reduced sample and propose a number of network-based metrics to reliably assess its quality (and that of other human mobility models). Our approach provides a well founded way to exploit temporal patterns to save effort in recording mobility data, and opens the possibility to scale up data from limited records when information on the full system is needed."
https://openalex.org/W1762342514,"Coastal economies and ecosystems have historically depended on oyster reefs, but this habitat has declined globally by 85% because of anthropogenic activities. In a Florida estuary, we investigated the cause of newly reported losses of oysters. We found that the oyster reefs have deteriorated from north to south and that this deterioration was positively correlated with the abundance of carnivorous conchs and water salinity. In experiments across these gradients, oysters survived regardless of salinity if conchs were excluded. After determining that conchs were the proximal cause of oyster loss, we tested whether elevated water salinity was linked to conch abundance either by increasing conch growth and survivorship or by decreasing the abundance of a predator of conchs. In field experiments across a salinity gradient, we failed to detect spatial variation in predation on conchs or in conch growth and survivorship. A laboratory experiment, however, demonstrated the role of salinity by showing that conch larvae failed to survive at low salinities. Because this estuary's salinity increased in 2006 in response to reduced inputs of freshwater, we concluded that the ultimate cause of oyster decline was an increase in salinity. According to records from 2002 to 2012, oyster harvests have remained steady in the northernmost estuaries of this ecoregion (characterized by high reef biomass, low salinity, and low conch abundance) but have declined in the southernmost estuaries (characterized by lower reef biomass, increases in salinity, and increases in conch abundance). Oyster conservation in this ecoregion, which is probably one of the few that still support viable oyster populations, may be undermined by drought-induced increases in salinity causing an increased abundance of carnivorous conchs."
https://openalex.org/W2279948827,"Although four maturity genes, E1 to E4, in soybean have been successfully cloned, their functional mechanisms and the regulatory network of photoperiodic flowering remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated how the diurnal expression pattern of the E1 gene is related to photoperiodic length; and to what extent allelic variation in the B3-like domain of the E1 gene is associated with flowering time phenotype. The bimodal expression of the E1 gene peaked first at around 2 hours after dawn in long-day condition. The basal expression level of E1 was enhanced by the long light phase, and decreased by duration of dark. We identified a 5bp (3 SNP and 2-bp deletion) mutation, referred to an e1-b3a, which occurs in the middle of B3 domain of the E1 gene in the early flowering cultivar Yanhuang 3. Subcellular localization analysis showed that the putative truncated e1-b3a protein was predominately distributed in nuclei, indicating the distribution pattern of e1-b3a was similar to that of E1, but not to that of e1-as. Furthermore, genetic analysis demonstrated allelic variations at the E1 locus significantly underlay flowering time in three F2 populations. Taken together, we can conclude the legume specific E1 gene confers some special features in photoperiodic control of flowering in soybean. Further characterization of the E1 gene will extend our understanding of the soybean flowering pathway in soybean."

https://openalex.org/W1193899825,"The high frequency of relapse of epithelial ovarian tumors treated with standard chemotherapy has highlighted the necessity to identify targeted therapies that can improve patient outcomes. The dynamic relationship between cyclin E and PKCiota frequent overexpression in high-grade ovarian tumors poses a novel pathway for therapeutic investigation. We hypothesized that a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling pathway activating PKCiota perpetuates cyclin E deregulation during ovarian tumorigenesis. We observed a positive correlation between PKCiota and cyclin E in a panel of 19 ovarian cancer cell lines. Modulation of cyclin E had no effect on PKCiota knockdown/overexpression; however, PKCiota differentially regulated cyclin E expression. In the serous ovarian cancer cells (IGROV and OVCAR-3), shPKCiota decreased proliferation, caused a G1 arrest and significantly prolonged overall survival in xenograft mouse models. In vitro, shPKCiota decreased the ability of IGROV cells to grow under anchorage-independent conditions and form aberrant acini, which was dependent on Ad-cyclin E or Ad-LMW-E expression. Reverse-phase protein array analysis of PKCiota wild-type, catalytic active, dominant-negative protein isoforms strengthened the association between phospho-PKCiota levels and PI3K pathway activation. Inhibitors of PI3K coordinately decreased phospho-PKCiota and cyclin E protein levels. In conclusion, we have identified a PI3K/PKCiota/cyclin E signaling pathway as a therapeutic target during ovarian tumorigenesis."

In addition, the ATP-enzyme interaction is suggested to play a crucial catalytic role by mutation of the P-loop residues hydrogen-bonded to ATP. Moreover, the ATP-enzyme interaction has also clarified the positioning and catalytic role of a conserved lysine residue in stabilization of the transition state. These findings provide new insights into the adenylation half-reaction in the domain alteration catalytic mechanism of the adenylate-forming enzymes. o-Succinylbenzoyl-CoA synthetase, or MenE, is one of the enzymes responsible for biosynthesis of vitamin K in bacteria, cyanobacteria, algae, and plants (1Nowicka B.

This enzyme is absent in mammals and thus is an attractive target for development of new antibacterial agents. In recent years, a number of potent inhibitors of MenE have been synthesized, and some of them have been shown to exhibit high antitubercular activities (6Tian Y. Suk D.-H. Cai F. Crich D.

MenE is homologous to acyl/aryl-CoA synthetases (ACS) and catalyzes a similar two-step reaction. In the first adenylation step, the OSB substrate reacts with Mg2+-ATP to form the adenylate intermediate, OSB-AMP, which subsequently reacts with the third substrate, coenzyme A, to form OSB-CoA in the second thioesterification step (Fig. 1). The same adenylation step is found in the reactions catalyzed by the adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) and firefly luciferases, which together with acyl/aryl-CoA synthetases form the ANL family of adenylating enzymes (9Gulick A.M.

Over the last several decades, several members of this enzyme family, including MenE, have been kinetically analyzed to adopt an ordered Bi Uni Uni Bi ping-pong mechanism, which involves ATP as the first binding substrate and a large conformational change during the catalysis (6Tian Y.

Early structural and related biochemical studies of adenylating enzymes in the ANL family were focused on luciferases and the adenylation domains of NRPS, which were found to be highly conserved in the three-dimensional structure consisting of a large N-terminal domain (N-domain) containing ∼400–550 residues and a smaller C-terminal domain (C-domain) containing ∼130 residues (16Conti E.

Ten conserved motifs, namely A1–A10, were identified to play important structural and catalytic roles in the enzymatic reactions, of which the A3 motif is the most conserved among the ANL family (19Marahiel M.A. Stachelhaus T. Mootz H.D. Modular peptide synthetases involved in nonribosomal peptide synthesis.Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 2651-2674Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar). This conserved A3 motif overlaps with “motif I,” which defines a consensus sequence of (T/S)(S/G)G(T/S)(T/S/E)GX(P/Q/M/T)K (20Chang K.-H. Xiang H. Dunaway-Mariano D. Acyl-adenylate motif of the acyl-adenylate/thioester-forming enzyme superfamily: a site-directed mutagenesis study with the Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS3 4-chlorobenzoate:coenzyme A ligase.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15650-15659Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and is homologous to the conserved phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) involved in binding of triphosphate by ATP- and GTP-binding kinases (21Saraste M. Sibbald P.R. Wittinghofer A. The P-loop–a common motif in ATP- and GTP-binding proteins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 430-434Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1748) Google Scholar). However, the active site formed at the interface of the N- and C-domains in the early crystal structures is only suitable for the first-step formation of the adenylate intermediate from the carboxylate and ATP substrates. In 2003, Gulick and co-workers (22Gulick A.M. Starai V.J. Horswill A.R. Homick K.M. Escalante-Semerena J.C. The 1.75 Å crystal structure of acetyl-CoA synthetase bound to adenosine-5′-propylphosphate and coenzyme A.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2866-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) used a nonhydrolyzable adenylate, adenosine 5′-propyl phosphate, and coenzyme A to trap the bacterial acetyl-CoA synthetase in a different conformation in which the C-domain is rotated around a hinge residue by 140° to form a new active site suitable for the second-step thioesterification. On this basis, a domain alteration mechanism was proposed for all adenylating enzymes in the ANL family involving two distinct active conformations, one for adenylate intermediate formation and the other for thioester formation (9Gulick A.M. Conformational dynamics in the acyl-CoA synthetases, adenylation domains of nonribosomal peptide synthetases, and firefly luciferase.ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 811-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). These two conformations form two distinct active sites with the same set of N-domain residues but a different set of residues on two opposite sides of the small C-domain, which rotates a large angle after adenylate formation to achieve conformational change and active site re-configuration. This domain alteration mechanism is strongly supported by the finding that mutation of residues on a different side of the C-domain specifically affects either the first or the second step of the reaction catalyzed by a number of adenylating enzymes such as 4-chlorobenzoyl:coenzyme A ligase (4CBL) (15Wu R.

The isolated product was lyophilized and re-dissolved in 10 mm Tris (pH 8.0) buffer for determination of its concentration by the UV absorbance at 250 nm (the extinction coefficient ϵ = 4900 m−1 cm−1). Other chemicals used in this study, including ATP, AMP, CoA, NaHCO3, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, polyethylene glycol (PEG), (±)-2-methyl-2,4-pentadiol, buffers, and other salts, were purchased from Sigma.

For the single substrate kinetics, a 140-μl standard assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 80 μm MenB, 20 mm NaHCO3 and a varied concentration of the substrate OSB, ATP, or CoA with the other two substrates fixed at a saturation concentration (OSB at 1.0 mm, ATP and CoA at 2.0 mm). The reactions were initiated by addition of BsMenE to a final concentration of 250 nm after a 3-min incubation. The real time absorbance increase at 392 nm was measured for at least 1 min, and the reaction rate was calculated from the slope of the initial linear region of the reaction progress curve. All activity assays were carried out in triplicate at 24 °C. Subsequently, the data were fit to Michaelis-Menten Equation 1, v=Vmax[S]/(KM+[S])(Eq. 1) where ν is the reaction rate (in μm/min); Vmax is the maximum reaction rate (in μm/min); [S] is the substrate concentration (in μm), and KM is the Michaelis-Menten constant (in μm). Crystallization conditions were screened using Index Screen and Crystal Screen I and II from Hampton Research or WizardTM Classic 3 and 4 from Rigaku. Crystallization was carried out with the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 16 °C.

For the binary complex with AMP and ternary complex with ATP and Mg2+, the diffraction datasets were processed similarly, and chain A of the full-length apo-BsMenE was used as the search model for structural determination by molecular replacement. Both structures were determined to have a space group of P43 and refined using the same strategy as for the apo-protein. Restraints of ATP and AMP were generated and refined using eLBOW (51Moriarty N.W. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D.

Replication fork reversal is emerging as an evolutionarily conserved physiological response for restart of stalled forks. Escherichia coli RecG, RuvAB, and RecA proteins have been shown to reverse the model replication fork structures in vitro. However, the pathways and the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a slow growing human pathogen, responds to different types of replication stress and DNA damage are unclear. Here, we show that M. tuberculosis RecG rescues E. coli ΔrecG cells from replicative stress. The purified M. tuberculosis RecG (MtRecG) and RuvAB (MtRuvAB) proteins catalyze fork reversal of model replication fork structures with and without a leading strand single-stranded DNA gap. Interestingly, single-stranded DNA-binding protein suppresses the MtRecG- and MtRuvAB-mediated fork reversal with substrates that contain lagging strand gap. Notably, our comparative studies with fork structures containing template damage and template switching mechanism of lesion bypass reveal that MtRecG but not MtRuvAB or MtRecA is proficient in driving the fork reversal. Finally, unlike MtRuvAB, we find that MtRecG drives efficient reversal of forks when fork structures are tightly bound by protein. These results provide direct evidence and valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of MtRecG-catalyzed replication fork remodeling and restart pathways in vivo.

https://openalex.org/W1798495686,"As a mismatch repair (MMR) gene, hMLH1 plays an important role in the maintenance of chromosomal integrity. Several studies have investigated the associations of hMLH1 -93G>A (rs1800734) and Ile219Val (rs1799977) in diverse tumor types with discordant results, but their roles in ovarian cancer in the Chinese population remains to be elucidated.In a case-control analysis, we assessed the association between these two polymorphisms and ovarian cancer risk in 421 ovarian cancer patients and 689 control subjects in the Chinese population using logistic regression.We found that the variant hMLH1 genotypes (-93AA and AG) are associated with risk of ovarian cancer (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-2.89) compared with the -93GG genotype. The A allele increases the risk of ovarian cancer in a dose-dependent manner (P<10-4). Functional test showed that -93A allele increased hMLH1 promoter transcriptional activity and the luciferase activity. However, no significant difference was found in the genotype frequencies at the Ile219Val site between the cases and controls.These findings indicate that the -93G>A polymorphism in hMLH1 may affect ovarian cancer susceptibility in the Chinese population."
https://openalex.org/W1865109952,"Background Children and patients with cognitive deficits may find it difficult to understand the implication of research. In the European Union (EU), clinical studies outside the EU directives concerning medicinal products or medical devices, i.e., “miscellaneous clinical studies”, have no legally mandated timelines for institutional review boards’ (IRB) decisions. Goal To evaluate the review process of IRBs for two different “miscellaneous” multicenter clinical research protocols involving vulnerable subjects (children and adult stroke patients). Methods Descriptive and comparative statistics. Protocol 1 is a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional screening study of a symptomatic pediatric population at risk for Fabry disease involving genetic testing (NCT02152189). Protocol 2 is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, blinded endpoint post-market study to evaluate the effectiveness of stent retrievers (NCT02135926). After having obtained positive initial IRB votes at the main study site, both protocols were subsequently submitted to the remaining IRBs. Results Protocol 1 was submitted to 19 IRBs. No IRB objected to the study. Median time-to-final vote was 34 (IQR 10–65; range 0 to 130) days. Two IRBs accepted the coordinating center’s IRB votes without re-evaluation. Changes to the informed consent documents were asked by 7/19 IRBs, amendments to the protocol by 2. Protocol 2 was submitted to 16 IRBs. Fifteen decisions were made. No IRB objected to the study. Median time-to final vote was 59 (IQR 10 to 65; range 0 to 128) days, which was not statistically significantly different compared with protocol 1 (Wilcoxon test). Two IRBs accepted a previous IRB decision and did not conduct an independent review. Eight/16 IRBs required changes to the informed consent documents; two IRBs recommended an amendment of the protocol. Conclusion Both clinical research protocols involving vulnerable populations were well accepted. IRB workflows and decision times varied substantially. Some IRBs accepted a previous IRB decision without the necessity of another reevaluation process. Requested changes were focused on the informed consent documents. A more standardized approach across jurisdictions is desirable."
https://openalex.org/W2099271458,"For current computational intelligence techniques, a major challenge is how to learn new concepts in changing environment. Traditional learning schemes could not adequately address this problem due to a lack of dynamic data selection mechanism. In this paper, inspired by human learning process, a novel classification algorithm based on incremental semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Through the analysis of prediction confidence of samples and data distribution in a changing environment, a ""soft-start"" approach, a data selection mechanism and a data cleaning mechanism are designed, which complete the construction of our incremental semi-supervised learning system. Noticeably, with the ingenious design procedure of our proposed algorithm, the computation complexity is reduced effectively. In addition, for the possible appearance of some new labeled samples in the learning process, a detailed analysis is also carried out. The results show that our algorithm does not rely on the model of sample distribution, has an extremely low rate of introducing wrong semi-labeled samples and can effectively make use of the unlabeled samples to enrich the knowledge system of classifier and improve the accuracy rate. Moreover, our method also has outstanding generalization performance and the ability to overcome the concept drift in a changing environment."
https://openalex.org/W1787053425,"A mycelial mattress of Rhizopus stolonifer obtained from a liquid static culture was utilized for wound dressing and biomedical use. Following screening of mutants induced by UV radiation, F6, exhibiting delayed sporangium formation was selected because its sporangium maturation exhibited a 5-day delay without significant loss of mycelial weight compared to the wild type. The sporangium-free mycelial mattress from the sporangiospore culture of F6 was treated with 1N sodium hydroxide NaOH at 85°C for 2 h to produce a sponge-like membrane named Rhizochitin. The trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysate of Rhizochitin contained 36% N-acetylglucosamine and 53% hexose respectively detected by the Elson-Morgen and phenol-sulfuric acid methods. Results indicated the wound area in rats covered with Rhizochitin was 40% less than that of the uncovered group. Rhizochitin decreased the expression of PDGF in the proliferation stage, increased the expression of TGF-β in the inflammation and proliferation stages, and increased the expression of VEGF in the inflammation and proliferation stages. Rhizochitin inhibited secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-9 on days 1, 7, 9, and 12 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 on days 3, 7, 9, and 12. It was concluded that Rhizochitin has beneficial properties of biocompatible, biodegradable, and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1811200147,"Microbial pathogens and host immune cells each initiate events following their interaction in an attempt to drive the outcome to their respective advantage. Here we show that the bacterial pathogen Yersinia pseudotuberculosis sustains itself on the surface of a macrophage by forming acidic fluid-accessible compartments that are partially bounded by the host cell plasma membrane. These Yersinia-containing acidic compartments (YACs) are bereft of the early endosomal marker EEA1 and the lysosomal antigen LAMP1 and readily form on primary macrophages as well as macrophage-like cell lines. YAC formation requires the presence of the Yersinia virulence plasmid which encodes a type III secretion system. Unexpectedly, we found that the initial formation of YACs did not require translocation of the type III effectors into the host cell cytosol; however, the duration of YACs was markedly greater in infections using translocation-competent Y. pseudotuberculosis strains as well as strains expressing the effector YopJ. Furthermore, it was in this translocation- and YopJ-dependent phase of infection that the acidic environment was critical for Y. pseudotuberculosis survival during its interaction with macrophages. Our findings indicate that during its extracellular phase of infection Y. pseudotuberculosis initiates and then, by a separate mechanism, stabilizes the formation of a highly intricate structure on the surface of the macrophage that is disengaged from the endocytic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2108527334,"Targeted mutations in mouse disrupt local chromatin structure and may lead to unanticipated local effects. We evaluated targeted gene promoter silencing in a group of six mutants carrying the tm1a Knockout Mouse Project allele containing both a LacZ reporter gene driven by the native promoter and a neo selection cassette. Messenger RNA levels of the reporter gene and targeted gene were assessed by qRT-PCR, and methylation of the promoter CpG islands and LacZ coding sequence were evaluated by sequencing of bisulfite-treated DNA. Mutants were stratified by LacZ staining into presumed Silenced and Expressed reporter genes. Silenced mutants had reduced relative quantities LacZ mRNA and greater CpG Island methylation compared with the Expressed mutant group. Within the silenced group, LacZ coding sequence methylation was significantly and positively correlated with CpG Island methylation, while promoter CpG methylation was only weakly correlated with LacZ gene mRNA. The results support the conclusion that there is promoter silencing in a subset of mutants carrying the tm1a allele. The features of targeted genes which promote local silencing when targeted remain unknown."
