Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia were recently shown to be caused by expansion of a (GGGGCC)n·(GGCCCC)n repeat in the C9orf72 gene. Mutant r(GGGGCC)n-containing transcripts aggregate in nuclear foci possibly sequestering repeat-binding proteins, suggesting a toxic RNA pathogenesis. We demonstrate that the r(GGGGCC)n RNA but not the C-rich r(GGCCCC)n RNA forms extremely stable uni- and multimolecular parallel G-quadruplex structures (up to 95 °C). Multimolecular G-quadruplex formation is influenced by repeat number and RNA concentration. MBNL1, a splicing factor that is sequestered in myotonic dystrophy patients by binding to expanded r(CUG)n repeat hairpins, does not bind the C9orf72 repeats, but the splicing factor ASF/SF2 can bind the r(GGGGCC)n repeat. Because multimolecular G-quadruplexes are enhanced by repeat length, RNA-RNA interactions facilitated by G-quadruplex formation at expanded repeats might influence transcript aggregation and foci formation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal dementia cells. Tract length-dependent G-quadruplex formation by the C9orf72 RNA should be considered when assessing the role of this repeat in C9orf72 gene activity, protein binding, transcript foci formation, and translation of the C9orf72 product, including the noncanonical repeat-associated non-ATG translation (RAN translation) into pathologic dipeptide repeats, as well as any oligonucleotide repeat-based therapy.

This suggested that ALS-FTD may share a toxic RNA pathogenic path with myotonic dystrophy whose r(CUG)n repeat-containing RNA sequesters MBNL1 proteins bound to the expanded repeat.

Expansion of gene-specific repeats is the causative mutation of numerous neurological and neuromuscular diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) fragile X type A, fragile X tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS), Huntington disease, and many spinocerebellar ataxias (6Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Repeat instability: mechanisms of dynamic mutations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). ALS-FTD is the most recent member of the DNA repeat expansion diseases. There are multiple mechanisms through which an expanded repeat tract can cause disease. Expansion of a (CTG)n·(CAG)n repeat in the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene results in the formation of long, stable RNA hairpin structures formed by the expanded r(CUG)n repeat, which binds to and sequesters the muscleblind-like (MBNL) family of splicing regulators to nuclear foci (7Miller J.W.

Swanson M.S. Pathogenic RNAs in microsatellite expansion disease.Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 466: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Loss of MBNL results in mis-splicing of its many target RNAs, leading to pathogenesis (8Shin J. Charizanis K. Swanson M.S. Pathogenic RNAs in microsatellite expansion disease.Neurosci. Lett. 2009; 466: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Expansion of the (CGG)n·(CCG)n repeat in the FMR1 gene can lead to three distinct syndromes, fragile X mental retardation, primary ovarian insufficiency, and fragile X-associated ataxia, where the latter is thought be mediated through sequestration of RNA-binding proteins bound to a toxic CGG-containing RNA found in nuclear foci in FXTAS brains (9Willemsen R. Levenga J. Oostra B.A. CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene: size matters.Clin. Genet. 2011; 80: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Expansions of coding CAG repeats, as occur in Huntington disease and several spinocerebellar ataxias, lead to toxic polyglutamine proteins, but some polyglutamine diseases are also thought to have toxic CAG RNAs (10Wojciechowska M. Krzyzosiak W.J. CAG repeat RNA as an auxiliary toxic agent in polyglutamine disorders.RNA Biol. 2011; 8: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). An underlying feature of all repeat diseases is the expansion of an (often bidirectionally) transcribed repeat tract that has the potential to form unusual DNA and RNA structures (6Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Repeat instability: mechanisms of dynamic mutations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 8Shin J. Charizanis K. Swanson M.S.

Partners in crime: bidirectional transcription in unstable microsatellite disease.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: R77-R82Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The G-rich nature of the ALS-FTD repeat makes it a candidate for secondary structure formation (6Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Repeat instability: mechanisms of dynamic mutations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). G-rich DNA and RNAs can form unusual structures called G-quadruplexes in vitro as well as in vivo (see Fig. 1) (12Neidle S.

McCafferty J. Balasubramanian S. Quantitative visualization of DNA G-quadruplex structures in human cells.Nat. Chem. 2013; 5: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1427) Google Scholar). In G-quadruplexes, four guanines interact through Hoogsteen bonding in a planar configuration around a central monovalent cation to form G-quartets (see Fig. 1, A–C) (12Neidle S.

Balasubramanian S. 5′-UTR RNA G-quadruplexes: translation regulation and targeting.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 4727-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Guanine residues can interact with other guanines of the same nucleic acid molecule to form unimolecular G-quadruplexes (see Fig. 1B) or with guanines from separate molecules to form multimolecular G-quadruplexes (see Fig. 1C) (12Neidle S.

G-quadruplexes are associated with biological processes including genetic instability, telomere regulation, gene regulation, immunoglobulin class switch recombination, splicing, and RNA translation regulation (15Lopes J.

Here we report formation of extremely stable uni- and multimolecular G-quadruplex structures in the RNA sequences of the sense ALS-FTD r(GGGGCC)n repeat, but not the complementary C-rich strand. G-quadruplex formation and complexity are affected by the number of repeats as well as the flanking sequence. Neither r(GGGGCC)n nor r(GGCCCC)n repeats are able to bind MBNL1 protein, but r(GGGGCC)n can bind the ASF/SF2 splicing regulator. Our findings suggest that G-quadruplex formation by the r(GGGGCC)n repeat tract from C9orf72 may shed light on normal and pathogenic roles of the repeat. Oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were heated to 95 °C and placed on ice. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP. Equal sample amounts, based on Cerenkov counting (10,000 cpm/sample), were electrophoresed on 6 or 8% polyacrylamide gels at 120 V for 60 min. All oligonucleotide sequences used in this study are indicated in the figures. CD analysis in a Jasco-J-815 spectrometer used 310 μl of RNA in a 1-mm cuvette. CD melting experiments used 1 ml of sample in a 1-cm cuvette. Oligonucleotides were heated to 95 °C and cooled at room temperature in buffer containing 10 mm K2HPO4 and 80 mm KCl (pH 7.5) (total [K+] = 100 mm) unless otherwise stated. An average of three CD scans, over the wavelength range of 330–200 nm, was acquired at a scan rate of 20 nm min−1 with an 8-s response time. CD spectra were corrected for buffer contributions. Data were collected at 25 °C unless otherwise stated. MBNL1 N-terminal protein construct (pGEX-6P-1-MBNL1-N; residues 1–283) was kindly provided by Dr. Maurice Swanson (20Yuan Y. Compton S.A. Sobczak K. Stenberg M.G. Thornton C.A. Griffith J.D. Swanson M.S. Muscleblind-like 1 interacts with RNA hairpins in splicing target and pathogenic RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5474-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Protein purification was carried out as described previously (20Yuan Y. Compton S.A. Sobczak K. Stenberg M.G. Thornton C.A. Griffith J.D. Swanson M.S. Muscleblind-like 1 interacts with RNA hairpins in splicing target and pathogenic RNAs.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 5474-5486Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in a 10-μl volume containing ∼10 fmol of [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled RNA (10,000 cpm) with the indicated amounts of either MBNL1 or ASF/SF2 (Abcam). MBNL1 reactions contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 100 ng/μl tRNA, and 1 μg/μl BSA. ASF/SF2 reactions contained 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) 200 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.05% Nonidet, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, 100 ng/μl tRNA, and 1 μg/μl BSA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature for 30 min, loaded onto 6% native polyacrylamide gels, electrophoresed at 120 V for 1 h in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA, dried, and autoradiographed. To determine whether the r(GGGGCC)n and r(GGCCCC)n repeats had the potential to form alternative structures, RNA oligonucleotides were assessed for their electrophoretic migration on native polyacrylamide gels. Frozen, [γ-32P]ATP end-labeled oligonucleotides were thawed at room temperature and electrophoresed on native or denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Autoradiography revealed two distinct products for r(GGGGCC)4 on a native gel but only one product on the denaturing gel, suggestive of unusual structure formation (Fig. 1D). The C-rich repeat did not display slow migrating products to the same degree (Fig. 1D). Notably, mfold predicts that r(GGGGCC)4 and r(GGCCCC)4 sequences will assume hairpins, but other structure prediction software such as EuQuad predicts G-quadruplex formation of G-rich sequences. Hairpin formation may compete with or contribute to G-quadruplex or other structure formation. When the oligonucleotides were first heated to 95 °C for 5 min and allowed to cool for 5 h to room temperature, we observed a reduced amount of the slower migrating r(GGGGCC)4 product (Fig. 1E, top arrow). This suggests that the slower migrating species may be an intermolecular G-quadruplex that was denatured at the high temperature that did not have sufficient time to reform during cooling. Multimolecular complexes form very slowly. These putative multimolecular r(GGGGCC) structures may be sensitive to freezing as demonstrated for other G-quadruplex-forming sequences (21Zhai Q. Deng M. Xu L. Zhang X. Zhou X. Promoting the formation of tetramolecular G-quadruplexes under freezing condition.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2012; 22: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Denaturation and renaturation of the r(GGGGCC)4 RNA in the presence of its complementary r(GGCCCC)4 RNA resulted in only a very small proportion of double-stranded, shifted species (Fig. 1E, lower arrow), suggesting that the vast majority of the unshifted species were in a highly stable, alternative structural state that was not available for regular Watson-Crick base pairing. The slower migrating r(GGGGCC)4 product is distinct from the double-stranded r(GGGGCC)4·r(GGCCCC)4. In contrast, when a DM1-associated r(CUG)15 hairpin is denatured and renatured in the presence of its complementary sequence, there is complete formation of a double-stranded, shifted species (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these observations indicate that the r(GGGGCC)4 RNA adopts unimolecular and multimolecular G-quadruplexes where the slower migrating products are in a multimolecular form and the faster migrating products are in unimolecular form but may also contain a proportion of stable hairpins as predicted by mfold. Multimolecular G-quadruplexes are dependent upon molecular concentration. To further confirm the multimolecularity of the r(GGGGCC)4 species, we performed denaturation/renaturation experiments at increasing RNA concentrations (Fig. 1G). We observed a concentration-dependent increase in the slower migrating r(GGGGCC)4 species (Fig. 1G). This is strong evidence that multimolecular G-quadruplexes are formed. Characteristically, G-quadruplexes are stabilized by potassium or sodium ions and destabilized by lithium (12Neidle S. The structures of quadruplex nucleic acids and their drug complexes.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 239-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 13Bugaut A. Balasubramanian S. 5′-UTR RNA G-quadruplexes: translation regulation and targeting.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 4727-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). The slower migrating electrophoretic species we observe formed in the presence of potassium ions, supporting its identity as a multimolecular G-quadruplex (Fig. 1, D–G). Toward confirming this, we assessed the effects of lithium or sodium ions (Fig. 1H). Lithium concentrations disfavored the slow migrating r(GGGGCC)4 species, whereas sodium enhanced it; both observations are consistent with the formation of a multimolecular G-quadruplex (Fig. 1H). No slow migrating species were observed for r(GGCCCC)4 (Fig. 1H). Repeat tract length is an important determinant of disease severity for repeat diseases including ALS-FTD (6Pearson C.E. Nichol Edamura K. Cleary J.D. Repeat instability: mechanisms of dynamic mutations.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 729-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Increasing repeat numbers can affect G-quadruplex formation by telomere repeats and slipped DNAs and R-loops by (CAG)/(CTG) and (CGG)/(CCG) repeats (22Pedroso I.M. Duarte L.F. Yanez G. Burkewitz K.

Sinden R.R. Alternative structures in duplex DNA formed within the trinucleotide repeats of the myotonic dystrophy and fragile X loci.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5041-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here we analyzed increasing r(GGGGCC)n repeat lengths of n = 4, 6, and 8 units (Fig. 1I). We observed a slow migrating species for 6 and 8 r(GGGGCC)n repeats as we did for 4 repeats, but we also observed additional faster and slower migrating species with the 6 and 8 repeats not evident in the 4-repeat RNA (Fig. 1I, arrows). These products were similar to faster and slower migrating G-quadruplex species reported for telomere oligonucleotides with varying repeat numbers (22Pedroso I.M. Duarte L.F. Yanez G. Burkewitz K. Fletcher T.M. Sequence specificity of inter- and intramolecular G-quadruplex formation by human telomeric DNA.Biopolymers. 2007; 87: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The formation of additional and distinct electrophoretic species is consistent with the formation of uni- and multimolecular G-quadruplexes with increasing repeat length (Fig. 1I). These oligonucleotides displayed only a single species on denaturing gels, confirming the altered migration on native gels to be due to secondary structure (data not shown). Thus, increased numbers of molecules of the r(GGGGCC)4 (Fig. 1G), as well as increased repeat numbers per molecule (n = 4, 6, and 8 repeats) (Fig. 1I) increased the formation of multimolecular G-quadruplexes. It was of interest to determine whether the r(GGGGCC)4 repeat formed G-quadruplexes in the context of C9orf72 as sequences immediately adjacent to G-quadruplex-forming sequences can cause structural alterations (27Arora A. Nair D.R. Maiti S. Effect of flanking bases on quadruplex stability and Watson-Crick duplex competition.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3628-3640Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Inclusion of 15 nucleotides of the C9orf72 gene immediately upstream of the repeat tract increased the heterogeneity of products (Fig. 1I). Multiple species are evident following native gel electrophoresis that are not present on denaturing gels (data not shown). This suggests that the r(GGGGCC)n quadruplex may be stabilized in numerous conformations in the context of the C9orf72 transcript. CD spectroscopy is a biophysical means to assess G-quadruplex formation in RNA (28Kumari S. Bugaut A. Huppert J.L. Balasubramanian S.

CD analysis of the r(GGGGCC)4 repeat in potassium buffer revealed a positive peak around 260 nm and a negative peak around 240 nm (Fig. 2A). These spectral features are characteristic of a parallel RNA G-quadruplex (28Kumari S. Bugaut A. Huppert J.L. Balasubramanian S.

Notably, there was a repeat tract length-dependent increase in G-quadruplex-associated CD signal (higher 260 nm peak and 240 nm negative peak), further supporting repeat tract length dependence of G-quadruplex formation. The spectrum was potassium ion-dependent, characteristic of G-quadruplexes; spectra obtained in lithium revealed a shift in the spectrum, from 260 nm toward 270 nm, as well as a shift in the negative peak at 240 nm, resembling the A-form of RNA hairpins predicted by mfold (Fig. 2C). CD analysis of the antisense r(GGCCCC)4 repeat in potassium revealed a positive peak at 270 nm and no negative peak at 240 nm, indicating that r(GGCCCC)4 did not form aG-quadruplex (Fig. 2C). Again, the peak closer to 270 nm and lack of the 240 nm negative peak are more typical of A-form RNA as described previously for r(CUG)n hairpins (29Sobczak K. Michlewski G. de Mezer M. Kierzek E.

Thus, the CD spectra provide further support of G-quadruplex formation by r(GGGGCC)n repeats. Other sequences that form G-quadruplexes show large variability in their thermal stability. To test the thermal stability of the structures formed by the r(GGGGCC)4 repeat, we measured the CD spectrum at increasing temperatures (Fig. 2D). There was a clear temperature-dependent reduction in the CD signal at higher temperatures. Surprisingly, although the CD signal decreased, the CD data did not indicate the complete dissociation of the G-quadruplex even at 95 °C (Fig. 2D). Furthermore, the repeat could not be melted even by lowering the potassium concentration to 10 mm in UV melting experiments (data not shown). Such extreme thermostability has previously been observed for G-rich quadruplex-forming sequences (30Merkina E.E. Fox K.R. Kinetic stability of intermolecular DNA quadruplexes.Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W1978887725,"Objectives Sleep debt reportedly increases emotional instability, such as anxiety and confusion, in addition to sleepiness and psychomotor impairment. However, the neural basis of emotional instability due to sleep debt has yet to be elucidated. This study investigated changes in emotional responses that are elicited by the simulation of short-term sleep loss and the brain regions responsible for these changes. Subjects and Methods Fourteen healthy adult men aged 24.1±3.3 years (range, 20–32 years) participated in a within-subject crossover study consisting of 5-day sessions of both sleep debt (4 h for time in bed) and sleep control (8 h for time in bed). On the last day of each session, participants underwent polysomnography and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Profile of Mood States questionnaires. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted while performing an emotional face viewing task. Results Restricted sleep over the 5-day period increased the activity of the left amygdala in response to the facial expression of fear, whereas a happy facial expression did not change the activity. Restricted sleep also resulted in a significant decrease in the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in proportion to the degree of sleep debt (as indicated by the percentage of slow wave sleep and δ wave power). This decrease was significantly correlated with activation of the left amygdala and deterioration of subjective mood state. Conclusion The results of this study suggest that continuous and accumulating sleep debt that can be experienced in everyday life can downregulate the functional suppression of the amygdala by the vACC and consequently enhance the response of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Such functional alteration in emotional control may, in part, be attributed to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt."
https://openalex.org/W2059670505,"The triglyceride-synthesizing enzyme acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (DGAT1) plays a critical role in hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection by recruiting the HCV capsid protein core onto the surface of cellular lipid droplets (LDs). Here we find a new interaction between the non-structural protein NS5A and DGAT1 and show that the trafficking of NS5A to LDs depends on DGAT1 activity. DGAT1 forms a complex with NS5A and core and facilitates the interaction between both viral proteins. A catalytically inactive mutant of DGAT1 (H426A) blocks the localization of NS5A, but not core, to LDs in a dominant-negative manner and impairs the release of infectious viral particles, underscoring the importance of DGAT1-mediated translocation of NS5A to LDs in viral particle production. We propose a model whereby DGAT1 serves as a cellular hub for HCV core and NS5A proteins, guiding both onto the surface of the same subset of LDs, those generated by DGAT1. These results highlight the critical role of DGAT1 as a host factor for HCV infection and as a potential drug target for antiviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1967719595,"MhuD is an oxygen-dependent heme-degrading enzyme from Mycobacterium tuberculosis with high sequence similarity (∼45%) to Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI. Spectroscopic and mutagenesis studies indicate that the catalytically active 1:1 heme-MhuD complex has an active site structure similar to those of IsdG and IsdI, including the nonplanarity (ruffling) of the heme group bound to the enzyme. Distinct from the canonical heme degradation, we have found that the MhuD catalysis does not generate CO. Product analyses by electrospray ionization-MS and NMR show that MhuD cleaves heme at the α-meso position but retains the meso-carbon atom at the cleavage site, which is removed by canonical heme oxygenases. The novel tetrapyrrole product of MhuD, termed ""mycobilin,"" has an aldehyde group at the cleavage site and a carbonyl group at either the β-meso or the δ-meso position. Consequently, MhuD catalysis does not involve verdoheme, the key intermediate of ring cleavage by canonical heme oxygenase enzymes. Ruffled heme is apparently responsible for the heme degradation mechanism unique to MhuD. In addition, MhuD heme degradation without CO liberation is biologically significant as one of the signals of M. tuberculosis transition to dormancy is mediated by the production of host CO."

Genome-wide association analyses revealed the highest associated quantitative trait locus for height at the withers on horse chromosome (ECA) 3 upstream of the candidate gene LCORL. Using 214 Hanoverian horses genotyped on the Illumina equine SNP50 BeadChip and 42 different horse breeds across all size ranges, we confirmed the highly associated single nucleotide polymorphism BIEC2-808543 (-log(10)P = 8.3) and the adjacent gene LCORL as the most promising candidate for body size. We investigated the relative expression levels of LCORL and its two neighbouring genes NCAPG and DCAF16 using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). We could demonstrate a significant association of the relative LCORL expression levels with the size of the horses and the BIEC2-808543 genotypes within and across horse breeds. In heterozygous C/T-horses expression levels of LCORL were significantly decreased by 40% and in homozygous C/C-horses by 56% relative to the smaller T/T-horses. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that this SNP T>C mutation is disrupting a putative binding site of the transcription factor TFIID which is important for the transcription process of genes involved in skeletal bone development. Thus, our findings suggest that expression levels of LCORL play a key role for body size within and across horse breeds and regulation of the expression of LCORL is associated with genetic variants of BIEC2-808543. This is the first functional study for a body size regulating polymorphism in horses and a further step to unravel the mechanisms for understanding the genetic regulation of body size in horses."
https://openalex.org/W1963857091,"In mammals, leptin released from the white adipose tissue acts on the central nervous system to control feeding behavior, cardiovascular function, and energy metabolism. Central leptin activates sympathetic nerves that innervate the kidney, adipose tissue, and some abdominal organs in rats. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is essential in the intracellular signaling pathway involving the activation of leptin receptors (ObRb). We investigated the potential of AMPKα2 in the sympathetic effects of leptin using in vivo siRNA injection to knockdown AMPKα2 in rats, to produce reduced hypothalamic AMPKα2 expression. Leptin effects on body weight, food intake, and blood FFA levels were eliminated in AMPKα2 siRNA-treated rats. Leptin-evoked enhancements of the sympathetic nerve outflows to the kidney, brown and white adipose tissues were attenuated in AMPKα2 siRNA-treated rats. To check whether AMPKα2 was specific to sympathetic changes induced by leptin, we examined the effects of injecting MT-II, a melanocortin-3 and -4 receptor agonist, on the sympathetic nerve outflows to the kidney and adipose tissue. MT-II-induced sympatho-excitation in the kidney was unchanged in AMPKα2 siRNA-treated rats. However, responses of neural activities involving adipose tissue to MT-II were attenuated in AMPKα2 siRNA-treated rats. These results suggest that hypothalamic AMPKα2 is involved not only in appetite and body weight regulation but also in the regulation of sympathetic nerve discharges to the kidney and adipose tissue. Thus, AMPK might function not only as an energy sensor, but as a key molecule in the cardiovascular, thermogenic, and lipolytic effects of leptin through the sympathetic nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2000496494,"The transcription/translation feedback loop-based molecular oscillator underlying the generation of circadian gene expression is preserved in almost all organisms. Interestingly, the animal circadian clock proteins CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), PERIOD (PER) and TIMELESS (TIM) are strongly conserved at the amino acid level through evolution. Within this evolutionary frame, TIM represents a fascinating puzzle. While Drosophila contains two paralogs, dTIM and dTIM2, acting in clock/photoreception and chromosome integrity/photoreception respectively, mammals contain only one TIM homolog. Whereas TIM has been shown to regulate replication termination and cell cycle progression, its functional link to the circadian clock is under debate. Here we show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of TIM in NIH3T3 and U2OS cells shortens the period by 1 hour and diminishes DNA damage-dependent phase advancing. Furthermore, we reveal that the N-terminus of TIM is sufficient for interaction with CRY1 and CHK1 as well for homodimerization, and the C-terminus is necessary for nuclear localization. Interestingly, the long TIM isoform (l-TIM), but not the short (s-TIM), interacts with CRY1 and both proteins can reciprocally regulate their nuclear translocation in transiently transfected COS7 cells. Finally, we demonstrate that co-expression of PER2 abolishes the formation of the TIM/CRY1 complex through affinity binding competition to the C-terminal tail of CRY1. Notably, the presence of the latter protein region evolutionarily and structurally distinguishes mammalian from insect CRYs. We propose that the dynamic interaction between these three proteins could represent a post-translational aspect of the mammalian circadian clock that is important for its pace and adaption to external stimuli, such as DNA damage and/or light."
https://openalex.org/W2088946637,"Electroacupuncture (EA) is a novel therapy based on traditional acupuncture combined with modern eletrotherapy that is currently being investigated as a treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Here, we studied whether acute EA stimulation improves tissue and functional outcome following experimentally induced cerebral ischemia in mice. We hypothesized that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-mediated perfusion augmentation was related to the beneficial effects of EA by interventions in acute ischemic injury. EA stimulation at Baihui (GV20) and Dazhui (GV14) increased cerebral perfusion in the cerebral cortex, which was suppressed in eNOS KO, but there was no mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) response. The increased perfusion elicited by EA were completely abolished by a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) blocker (atropine), but not a β-adrenergic receptor blocker (propranolol), an α-adrenergic receptor blocker (phentolamine), or a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) blocker (mecamylamine). In addition, EA increased acetylcholine (ACh) release and mAChR M3 expression in the cerebral cortex. Acute EA stimulation after occlusion significantly reduced infarct volume by 34.5% when compared to a control group of mice at 24 h after 60 min-middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (moderate ischemic injury), but not 90-min MCAO (severe ischemic injury). Furthermore, the impact of EA on moderate ischemic injury was totally abolished in eNOS KO. Consistent with a smaller infarct size, acute EA stimulation led to prominent improvement of neurological function and vestibule-motor function. Our results suggest that acute EA stimulation after moderate focal cerebral ischemia, but not severe ischemia improves tissue and functional recovery and ACh/eNOS-mediated perfusion augmentation might be related to these beneficial effects of EA by interventions in acute ischemic injury."
https://openalex.org/W2022091835,"Small non-coding RNAs constitute a large family of regulatory molecules with diverse functions. Notably, some small non-coding RNAs matched to rDNA have been identified as qiRNAs and small guide RNAs involved in various biological processes. However, a large number of small rDNA-derived RNAs (srRNAs) are usually neglected and yet to be investigated. We systematically investigated srRNAs using small RNA datasets generated by high-throughput sequencing, and found srRNAs are mainly mapped to rRNA coding regions in sense direction. The datasets from immunoprecipitation and high-throughput sequencing demonstrate that srRNAs are co-immunoprecipitated with Argonaute (AGO) proteins. Furthermore, the srRNA expression profile in mouse liver is affected by diabetes. Overexpression or inhibition of srRNAs in cultured cells shows that srRNAs are involved in various signaling pathways. This study presents a global view of srRNAs in total small RNA and AGO protein complex from different species, and demonstrates that srRNAs are correlated with diabetes, and involved in some biological processes. These findings provide new insights into srRNAs and their functions in various physiological and pathological processes."
https://openalex.org/W1997142974,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) is an opportunistic pathogen commonly associated with lung and wound infections. Hypoxia is a frequent feature of the microenvironment of infected tissues which induces the expression of genes associated with innate immunity and inflammation in host cells primarily through the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-κB) pathways which are regulated by oxygen-dependent prolyl-hydroxylases. Hypoxia also affects virulence and antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens. However, less is known about the impact of hypoxia on host-pathogen interactions such as bacterial adhesion and infection. In the current study, we demonstrate that hypoxia decreases the internalization of P. aeruginosa into cultured epithelial cells resulting in decreased host cell death. This response can also be elicited by the hydroxylase inhibitor Dimethyloxallyl Glycine (DMOG). Reducing HIF-2α expression or Rho kinase activity diminished the effects of hypoxia on P. aeruginosa infection. Furthermore, in an in vivo pneumonia infection model, application of DMOG 48 h before infection with P. aeruginosa significantly reduced mortality. Thus, hypoxia reduces P. aeruginosa internalization into epithelial cells and pharmacologic manipulation of the host pathways involved may represent new therapeutic targets in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infection."
https://openalex.org/W2004541176,"Several cognitive changes characterize normal aging; one change regards inhibitory processing and includes both conflict monitoring and response suppression. We attempted to segregate these two aspects within a Go/No-go task, investigating three age categories. Accuracy, response times and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The ERP data were analyzed, and the Go and No-go trials were separated; in addition, the trials were organized in repeat trials (in which the subjects repeated the action delivered in the previous trial) and switch trials (in which the subjects produced a response opposite to the previous response). We assumed that the switch trials conveyed more conflict than the repeat trials. In general, the behavioral data and slower P3 latencies confirmed the well-known age-related speed/accuracy trade-off. The novel analyses of the repeat vs. switch trials indicated that the age-related P3 slowing was significant only for the high conflict condition; the switch-P3 amplitude increased only in the two older groups. The ‘aging switch effect’ on the P3 component suggests a failure in the conflict conditions and likely contributes to a generalized dysfunction. The absence of either a switch effect in the young group and the P3 slowing in middle-aged group indicate that switching was not particularly demanding for these participants. The N2 component was less sensitive to the repeat/switch manipulation; however, the subtractive waves also enhanced the age effects in this earlier time window. The topographic maps showed other notable age effects: the frontal No-go N2 was nearly undetectable in the elderly; in the identical time window, a large activity in the posterior and prefrontal scalp regions was observed. Moreover, the prefrontal activity showed a negative correlation with false alarms. These results suggest that the frontal involvement during action suppression becomes progressively dysfunctional with aging, and additional activity was required to reach a good level of accuracy."

InCites offers a unique opportunity to study the normalized citation impacts of countries using (i) a long publication window (1981 to 2010), (ii) a differentiation in (broad or more narrow) subject areas, and (iii) allowing for the use of statistical procedures in order to obtain an insightful investigation of national citation trends across the years. Using four broad categories, our results show significantly increasing trends in citation impact values for France, the UK, and especially Germany across the last thirty years in all areas. The citation impact of papers from China is still at a relatively low level (mostly below the world average), but the country follows an increasing trend line. The USA exhibits a stable pattern of high citation impact values across the years. With small impact differences between the publication years, the US trend is increasing in engineering and technology but decreasing in medical and health sciences as well as in agricultural sciences. Similar to the USA, Japan follows increasing as well as decreasing trends in different subject areas, but the variability across the years is small. In most of the years, papers from Japan perform below or approximately at the world average in each subject area."
https://openalex.org/W2054384670,"Background Acute pancreatitis is potentially fatal but treatment options are limited as disease pathogenesis is poorly understood. IL-33, a novel IL-1 cytokine family member, plays a role in various inflammatory conditions but its role in acute pancreatitis is not well understood. Specifically, whether pancreatic acinar cells produce IL-33 when stressed or respond to IL-33 stimulation, and whether IL-33 exacerbates acute pancreatic inflammation is unknown. Methods/Results In duct ligation-induced acute pancreatitis in mice and rats, we found that (a) IL-33 concentration was increased in the pancreas; (b) mast cells, which secrete and also respond to IL-33, showed degranulation in the pancreas and lung; (c) plasma histamine and pancreatic substance P concentrations were increased; and (d) pancreatic and pulmonary proinflammatory cytokine concentrations were increased. In isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells, TNF-α stimulation increased IL-33 release while IL-33 stimulation increased proinflammatory cytokine release, both involving the ERK MAP kinase pathway; the flavonoid luteolin inhibited IL-33-stimulated IL-6 and CCL2/MCP-1 release. In mice without duct ligation, exogenous IL-33 administration induced pancreatic inflammation without mast cell degranulation or jejunal inflammation; pancreatic changes included multifocal edema and perivascular infiltration by neutrophils and some macrophages. ERK MAP kinase (but not p38 or JNK) and NF-kB subunit p65 were activated in the pancreas of mice receiving exogenous IL-33, and acinar cells isolated from the pancreas of these mice showed increased spontaneous cytokine release (IL-6, CXCL2/MIP-2α). Also, IL-33 activated ERK in human pancreatic tissue. Significance As exogenous IL-33 does not induce jejunal inflammation in the same mice in which it induces pancreatic inflammation, we have discovered a potential role for an IL-33/acinar cell axis in the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages and the exacerbation of acute pancreatic inflammation. Conclusion IL-33 is induced in acute pancreatitis, activates acinar cell proinflammatory pathways and exacerbates acute pancreatic inflammation."

The present study investigated the association of Mg level in the serum or urine of the patients, lived in the Northeast areas of China, with either pre-diabetes or diabetes with and without complications. From January 2010 to October 2011, patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D, n = 25), type 2 diabetes (T2D, n = 137), impaired fasting glucose (IFG, n = 12) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT, n = 15), and age/gender matched control (n = 50) were enrolled in the First Hospital of Jilin University. In T2D group, there were 24, 34, and 50 patients with nephropathy, retinopathy or peripheral neuropathy. Serum Mg levels in the patients with IGT, IFG, T2D, and T1D were significantly lower than that of control. The urinary Mg levels were significantly increased only in T2D and T1D patients compared to control. There was no difference for these two changes among T2D with and without complications; In addition, there was a significantly positive correlation of serum Mg levels with serum Ca levels only in T2D patients, and also a significantly positive correlation of urinary Mg levels with urinary Ca levels in control, IGT patients, and T2D patients. Simvastatin treatment in T2D patients selectively reduced serum Ca levels and urinary Mg levels. These results suggest that the potential impact of Mg deficiency on metabolic syndrome, diabetes and diabetic complications needs to be received special attention."

Several bioactive extracts from A. aegerita have been found to exhibit antitumor and antioxidant activities. However, limited genetic resources for A. aegerita have hindered exploration of this species. Methodology/Principal Findings To facilitate the research on A. aegerita, we established a deep survey of the transcriptome and proteome of this mushroom. We applied high-throughput sequencing technology (Illumina) to sequence A. aegerita transcriptomes from mycelium and fruiting body. The raw clean reads were de novo assembled into a total of 36,134 expressed sequences tags (ESTs) with an average length of 663 bp. These ESTs were annotated and classified according to Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways. Gene expression profile analysis showed that 18,474 ESTs were differentially expressed, with 10,131 up-regulated in mycelium and 8,343 up-regulated in fruiting body. Putative genes involved in polysaccharide and steroid biosynthesis were identified from A. aegerita transcriptome, and these genes were differentially expressed at the two stages of A. aegerita. Based on one-dimensional gel electrophoresis (1-DGE) coupled with electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-ESI-MS/MS), we identified a total of 309 non-redundant proteins. And many metabolic enzymes involved in glycolysis were identified in the protein database. Conclusions/Significance This is the first study on transcriptome and proteome analyses of A. aegerita. The data in this study serve as a resource of A. aegerita transcripts and proteins, and offer clues to the applications of this mushroom in nutrition, pharmacy and industry."

A universal actin filament regulator is the protein tropomyosin, which binds end-to-end along the length of the filament. The actin-tropomyosin filament structure is unknown, but there are atomic models in different regulatory states based on electron microscopy reconstructions, computational modeling of actin-tropomyosin, and docking of atomic resolution structures of tropomyosin to actin filament models. Here, we have tested models of the actin-tropomyosin interface in the “closed state” where tropomyosin binds to actin in the absence of myosin or troponin. Using mutagenesis coupled with functional analyses, we determined residues of actin and tropomyosin required for complex formation. The sites of mutations in tropomyosin were based on an evolutionary analysis and revealed a pattern of basic and acidic residues in the first halves of the periodic repeats (periods) in tropomyosin. In periods P1, P4, and P6, basic residues are most important for actin affinity, in contrast to periods P2, P3, P5, and P7, where both basic and acidic residues or predominantly acidic residues contribute to actin affinity. Hydrophobic interactions were found to be relatively less important for actin binding. We mutated actin residues in subdomains 1 and 3 (Asp25-Glu334-Lys326-Lys328) that are poised to make electrostatic interactions with the residues in the repeating motif on tropomyosin in the models.

https://openalex.org/W2084711515,"Use of illicit stimulants such as methamphetamine, cocaine, and ecstasy is an increasing health problem. Chronic use can cause neurotoxicity in animals and humans but the long-term consequences are not well understood. The aim of the current study was to investigate the long-term effect of stimulant use on the morphology of the human substantia nigra. We hypothesised that history of illicit stimulant use is associated with an abnormally bright and enlarged substantia nigra (termed ‘hyperechogenicity’) when viewed with transcranial sonography. Substantia nigra morphology was assessed in abstinent stimulant users (n = 36; 31±9 yrs) and in two groups of control subjects: non-drug users (n = 29; 24±5 yrs) and cannabis users (n = 12; 25±7 yrs). Substantia nigra morphology was viewed with transcranial sonography and the area of echogenicity at the anatomical site of the substantia nigra was measured at its greatest extent. The area of substantia nigra echogenicity was significantly larger in the stimulant group (0.273±0.078 cm2) than in the control (0.201±0.054 cm2; P<0.001) and cannabis (0.202±0.045 cm2; P<0.007) groups. 53% of stimulant users exhibited echogenicity that exceeded the 90th percentile for the control group. The results of the current study suggest that individuals with a history of illicit stimulant use exhibit abnormal substantia nigra morphology. Substantia nigra hyperechogenicity is a strong risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease later in life and further research is required to determine if the observed abnormality in stimulant users is associated with a functional deficit of the nigro-striatal system."
https://openalex.org/W2119304760,"SCD in pregnancy is associated with increased adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. In Tanzania where the frequency of sickle cell trait is 13% there has been scanty data on SCD in pregnancy. With progressive improvement in childhood survival the burden of SCD in pregnancy will increase. We analyzed all deliveries at Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH) from 1999 to 2011. Fetal and maternal outcomes of SCD deliveries were compared with non-SCD. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics version 19. Chi square and Fisher Exact tests were used to compare proportions and the independent t-test for continuous data. To predict risks of adverse effects, odds ratios were determined using multivariate logistic regression. A p-value<0.05 was considered significant. In total, 157,473 deliveries occurred at MNH during the study period, of which 149 were SCD (incidence of 95 SCD per 100,000 deliveries). The incidence of SCD had increased from 76 per 100,000 deliveries in the 1999–2002 period to over 100 per 100, 000 deliveries in recent years. The mean maternal age at delivery was lower in SCD (24.0±5.5 years) than in non-SCD deliveries (26.2±6.0 years), p<0.001. Compared with non-SCD (2.9±0.7 Kg), SCD deliveries had less mean birth-weight (2.6±0.6 Kg), p<0.001. SCD were more likely than non-SCD to deliver low APGAR score at 5 minutes (34.5% Vs 15.0%, OR = 3.0, 95%CI: 2.1–4.2), stillbirths (25.7% Vs 7.5%, OR = 4.0, 95%CI: 2.8–5.8). There was excessive risk of maternal deaths in SCD compared to non-SCD (11.4% Vs 0.4%, OR = 29, 95%CI: 17.3–48.1). The leading cause of deaths in SCD was infections in wholly 82% in contrast to only 32% in non-SCD.

This study investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between a range of individual, behavioural, social and policy/organisational correlates and objectively measured school break time physical activity and sedentary time. Methods In 2006, 146 adolescents (50% males; mean age = 14.1±0.6 years) completed a questionnaire and wore an accelerometer for ≥3 school days. Time spent engaged in sedentary, light (LPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) during school break times (recess and lunchtime) were calculated using existing cut-points. Measures were repeated in 2008 among 111 adolescents. Multilevel models examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations. Results Bringing in equipment was cross-sectionally associated with 3.2% more MVPA during break times. Females engaged in 5.1% more sedentary time than males, whilst older adolescents engaged in less MVPA than younger adolescents. Few longitudinal associations were observed. Adolescents who brought sports equipment to school engaged in 7.2% less LPA during break times two years later compared to those who did not bring equipment to school. Conclusion These data suggest that providing equipment and reducing restrictions on bringing in sports equipment to school may promote physical activity during school recess. Strategies targeting females' and older adolescents', in particular, are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1993811536,"The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) governs the expression of antioxidant and phase II detoxifying enzymes. Nrf2 activation can prevent or reduce cellular damage associated with several types of injury in many different tissues and organs. Dominant mutations in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause familial forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal disorder characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons and subsequent muscular atrophy. We have previously shown that Nrf2 activation in astrocytes delays neurodegeneration in ALS mouse models. To further investigate the role of Nrf2 in ALS we determined the effect of absence of Nrf2 or its restricted overexpression in neurons or type II skeletal muscle fibers on symptoms onset and survival in mutant hSOD1 expressing mice. We did not observe any detrimental effect associated with the lack of Nrf2 in two different mutant hSOD1 animal models of ALS. However, restricted Nrf2 overexpression in neurons or type II skeletal muscle fibers delayed disease onset but failed to extend survival in hSOD1G93A mice. These results highlight the concept that not only the pharmacological target but also the cell type targeted may be relevant when considering a Nrf2-mediated therapeutic approach for ALS."

It has been thought that functional myocardial repair and regeneration could be regulated by stem cell-cardiomyocyte contact. However, because various contact modes (junction formation, cell fusion, partial cell fusion, and tunneling nanotube formation) occur randomly in a conventional coculture system, the particular regulation corresponding to a specific contact mode could not be analyzed. In this study, we used laser-patterned biochips to define cell-cell contact modes for systematic study of contact-mediated cellular interactions at the single-cell level. The results showed that the biochip design allows defined stem cell-cardiomyocyte contact-mode formation, which can be used to determine specific cellular interactions, including electrical coupling, mechanical coupling, and mitochondria transfer. The biochips will help us gain knowledge of contact-mediated interactions between stem cells and cardiomyocytes, which are fundamental for formulating a strategy to achieve stem cell-based cardiac tissue regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2080174487,"The PACSIN (protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons) adapter proteins couple components of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery with regulators of actin polymerization and thereby regulate the surface expression of specific receptors. The brain-specific PACSIN 1 is enriched at synapses and has been proposed to affect neuromorphogenesis and the formation and maturation of dendritic spines. In studies of how phosphorylation of PACSIN 1 contributes to neuronal function, we identified serine 358 as a specific site used by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in vitro and in vivo. Phosphorylated PACSIN 1 was found in neuronal cytosol and membrane fractions. This localization could be modulated by trophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). We further show that expression of a phospho-negative PACSIN 1 mutant, S358A, or inhibition of CK2 drastically reduces spine formation in neurons. We identified a novel protein complex containing the spine regulator Rac1, its GTPase-activating protein neuron-associated developmentally regulated protein (NADRIN), and PACSIN 1. CK2 phosphorylation of PACSIN 1 leads to a dissociation of the complex upon BDNF treatment and induces Rac1-dependent spine formation in dendrites of hippocampal neurons. These findings suggest that upon BDNF signaling PACSIN 1 is phosphorylated by CK2 which is essential for spine formation."
https://openalex.org/W2065933248,"Small heat shock protein 17.8 (HSP17.8) is produced abundantly in plant cells under heat and other stress conditions and may play an important role in plant tolerance to stress environments. However, HSP17.8 may be differentially expressed in different accessions of a crop species exposed to identical stress conditions. The ability of different genotypes to adapt to various stress conditions resides in their genetic diversity. Allelic variations are the most common forms of genetic variation in natural populations. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the HSP17.8 gene were investigated across 210 barley accessions collected from 30 countries using EcoTILLING technology. Eleven SNPs including 10 from the coding region of HSP17.8 were detected, which form nine distinguishable haplotypes in the barley collection. Among the 10 SNPs in the coding region, six are missense mutations and four are synonymous nucleotide changes. Five of the six missense changes are predicted to be deleterious to HSP17.8 function. The accessions from Middle East Asia showed the higher nucleotide diversity of HSP17.8 than those from other regions and wild barley (H. spontaneum) accessions exhibited greater diversity than the cultivated barley (H. vulgare) accessions. Four SNPs in HSP17.8 were found associated with at least one of the agronomic traits evaluated except for spike length, namely number of grains per spike, thousand kernel weight, plant height, flag leaf area and leaf color. The association between SNP and these agronomic traits may provide new insight for study of the gene's potential contribution to drought tolerance of barley."
https://openalex.org/W1973753287,"A negative regulator of the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway, A20 (TNFAIP3), is inactivated in several types of lymphomas; particularly in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, and extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. These findings suggest that the NF-κB activation is related to A20 inactivation. Recently, A20 inactivation has also been observed in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-related lymphomas; however, this occurrence has not been well investigated. Moreover, NF-κB is a key molecule in activated B-cell-like (ABC)-type DLBCL; EBV-associated DLBCL is of the ABC type. Therefore, we focused on A20 deletions in EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorders/lymphomas. Using fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis, A20 deletions were identified in 4 of 13 samples from patients with pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) (31%), 3 of 20 samples from nasal-type NK/T cell lymphomas (NKTLs) (15%), 1 of 8 samples of EBV-positive DLBCL of the elderly (DLBCL-e) (13%), but not in any of the 11 samples from individuals with methotrexate-related lymphoproliferative disorder (MTX-LPD) (0%). Among the samples with A20 deletions, EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) expression was detected in all 4 of the PAL samples with A20 deletions and in the DLBCL-e sample with an A20 deletion, but not in any of the 3 NKTL samples. This finding indicated that A20 deletions were not directly related to the EBV latency pattern of lymphomas, although such deletions might be related to the diagnostic category. Immunohistologically, the A20 protein was absent in 2 (15%) of the 13 PAL samples, 1 (9%) of 11 MTX-LPD samples, and in none of the 20 NKTL (0%) or 8 DLBCL-e samples. In conclusion, A20 deletion and/or dysfunctional expression are frequently associated with PALs, and A20 abnormalities may be related to the pathogenesis of PAL."

Uninfected and infected cells without IL-10 cells served as controls. HLA-G expression was measured by real-time PCR and flow cytometry, respectively. Cells apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis associated moleculars were measured by real-time PCR and Western bolt.HLA-G expression was increased in the infected trophoblasts and BeWo cells compared to uninfected cells. Treatment of infected cells with IL-10 decreased HLA-G expression compared to infected cells while no change in treatment of uninfected cells compared with uninfected cells. Levels of apoptosis and apoptosis associated caspase-3 and caspase-8 decreased and c-FLIP levels increased in treated infected cells with IL-10 compared to infected cells and no difference in IL-10 treated uninfected cells compared to uninfected cells.IL-10 regulates HLA-G expression in T. gondii-infected trophoblasts.

https://openalex.org/W2008914755,"Natural variation in organ morphologies can have adaptive significance and contribute to speciation. However, the underlying allelic differences responsible for variation in organ size and shape remain poorly understood. We have utilized natural phenotypic variation in three Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes to examine the genetic basis for quantitative variation in petal length, width, area, and shape. We identified 23 loci responsible for such variation, many of which appear to correspond to genes not previously implicated in controlling organ morphology. These analyses also demonstrated that allelic differences at distinct loci can independently affect petal length, width, area or shape, suggesting that these traits behave as independent modules. We also showed that ERECTA (ER), encoding a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptor-like serine-threonine kinase, is a major effect locus determining petal shape. Allelic variation at the ER locus was associated with differences in petal cell proliferation and concomitant effects on petal shape. ER has been previously shown to be required for regulating cell division and expansion in other contexts; the ER receptor-like kinase functioning to also control organ-specific proliferation patterns suggests that allelic variation in common signaling components may nonetheless have been a key factor in morphological diversification."
https://openalex.org/W2025335471,"Pleural tuberculosis (TB), together with lymphatic TB, constitutes more than half of all extrapulmonary cases. Pleural effusions (PEs) in TB are representative of lymphocytic PEs which are dominated by T cells. However, the mechanism underlying T lymphocytes homing and accumulation in PEs is still incompletely understood. Here we performed a comparative analysis of cytokine abundance in PEs from TB patients and non-TB patients by protein array analysis and observed that MCP-2/CCL8 is highly expressed in the TB-PEs as compared to peripheral blood. Meanwhile, we observed that CCR5, the primary receptor used by MCP-2/CCL8, is mostly expressed on pleural CD4+ T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we found that infection with either Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv induced production of MCP-2/CCL8 at both transcriptional and protein level in Raw264.7 and THP-1 macrophage cells, mouse peritoneal macrophages as well as human PBMC monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The induction of MCP-2/CCL8 by mycobacteria is dependent on the activation of TLR2/PI3K/Akt and p38 signaling pathway. We conclude that accumulation of MCP-2/CCL8 in TB-PEs may function as a biomarker for TB diagnosis."

https://openalex.org/W2036585962,"The conserved, ubiquitin-selective AAA ATPase Cdc48 regulates numerous cellular processes including protein quality control, DNA repair and the cell cycle. Cdc48 function is tightly controlled by a multitude of cofactors mediating substrate specificity and processing. The UBX domain protein Shp1 is a bona fide substrate-recruiting cofactor of Cdc48 in the budding yeast S. cerevisiae. Even though Shp1 has been proposed to be a positive regulator of Glc7, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 in S. cerevisiae, its cellular functions in complex with Cdc48 remain largely unknown. Here we show that deletion of the SHP1 gene results in severe growth defects and a cell cycle delay at the metaphase to anaphase transition caused by reduced Glc7 activity. Using an engineered Cdc48 binding-deficient variant of Shp1, we establish the Cdc48Shp1 complex as a critical regulator of mitotic Glc7 activity. We demonstrate that shp1 mutants possess a perturbed balance of Glc7 phosphatase and Ipl1 (Aurora B) kinase activities and show that hyper-phosphorylation of the kinetochore protein Dam1, a key mitotic substrate of Glc7 and Ipl1, is a critical defect in shp1. We also show for the first time a physical interaction between Glc7 and Shp1 in vivo. Whereas loss of Shp1 does not significantly affect Glc7 protein levels or localization, it causes reduced binding of the activator protein Glc8 to Glc7. Our data suggest that the Cdc48Shp1 complex controls Glc7 activity by regulating its interaction with Glc8 and possibly further regulatory subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2042635539,"Introduction To investigate whether the difference between sodium and chloride ([Na+] – [Cl−]) and anion gap corrected for albumin and lactate (AGcorr) could be used as apparent strong ion difference (SIDapp) and strong ion gap (SIG) surrogates (respectively) in critically ill patients. Methods A total of 341 patients were prospectively observed; 161 were allocated to the modeling group, and 180 to the validation group. Simple regression analysis was used to construct a mathematical model between SIDapp and [Na+] – [Cl−] and between SIG and AGcorr in the modeling group. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was also measured. The mathematical models were tested in the validation group. Results in the modeling group, SIDapp and SIG were well predicted by [Na+] – [Cl−] and AGcorr (R2 = 0.973 and 0.96, respectively). Accuracy values of [Na+] – [Cl−] for the identification of SIDapp acidosis (<42.7 mEq/L) and alkalosis (>47.5 mEq/L) were 0.992 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.963–1) and 0.998 (95%CI, 0.972–1), respectively. The accuracy of AGcorr in revealing SIG acidosis (>8 mEq/L) was 0.974 (95%CI: 0.936–0.993). These results were validated by showing excellent correlations and good agreements between predicted and measured SIDapp and between predicted and measured SIG in the validation group (R2 = 0.977; bias = 0±1.5 mEq/L and R2 = 0.96; bias = −0.2±1.8 mEq/L, respectively). Conclusions SIDapp and SIG can be substituted by [Na+] – [Cl−] and by AGcorr respectively in the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders in critically ill patients."
https://openalex.org/W2061784175,"The spontaneous destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta cells in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice provides a valuable model of type 1 diabetes. As in humans, disease susceptibility is controlled by the classical MHC class II genes that guide CD4(+) T cell responses to self and foreign antigens. It has long been suspected that the dedicated class II chaperone designated HLA-DM in humans or H-2M in mice also makes an important contribution, but due to tight linkage within the MHC, a possible role played by DM peptide editing has not been previously tested by conventional genetic approaches. Here we exploited newly established germ-line competent NOD ES cells to engineer a loss of function allele. DM deficient NOD mice display defective class II peptide occupancy and surface expression, and are completely protected against type 1 diabetes. Interestingly the mutation results in increased proportional representation of CD4(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells and the absence of pathogenic CD4(+) T effectors. Overall, this striking phenotype establishes that DM-mediated peptide selection plays an essential role in the development of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice."
https://openalex.org/W2163250861,"Subthreshold signal detection is an important task for animal survival in complex environments, where noise increases both the external signal response and the spontaneous spiking of neurons. The mechanism by which neurons process the coding of signals is not well understood. Here, we propose that coincidence detection, one of the ways to describe the functionality of a single neural cell, can improve the reliability and the precision of signal detection through detection of presynaptic input synchrony. Using a simplified neuronal network model composed of dozens of integrate-and-fire neurons and a single coincidence-detector neuron, we show how the network reads out the subthreshold noisy signals reliably and precisely. We find suitable pairing parameters, the threshold and the detection time window of the coincidence-detector neuron, that optimize the precision and reliability of the neuron. Furthermore, it is observed that the refractory period induces an oscillation in the spontaneous firing, but the neuron can inhibit this activity and improve the reliability and precision further. In the case of intermediate intrinsic states of the input neuron, the network responds to the input more efficiently. These results present the critical link between spiking synchrony and noisy signal transfer, which is utilized in coincidence detection, resulting in enhancement of temporally sensitive coding scheme."
https://openalex.org/W2059735486,"Familial Danish dementia (FDD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by a 10-nucleotide duplication-insertion in the BRI(2) gene. FDD is clinically characterized by loss of vision, hearing impairment, cerebellar ataxia and dementia. The main neuropathologic findings in FDD are the deposition of Danish amyloid (ADan) and the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Here we investigated tau accumulation and truncation in double transgenic (Tg-FDD-Tau) mice generated by crossing transgenic mice expressing human Danish mutant BRI(2) (Tg-FDD) with mice expressing human 4-repeat mutant Tau-P301S (Tg-Tau). Compared to Tg-Tau mice, we observed a significant enhancement of tau deposition in Tg-FDD-Tau mice. In addition, a significant increase in tau cleaved at aspartic acid (Asp) 421 was observed in Tg-FDD-Tau mice. Tg-FDD-Tau mice also showed a significant decrease in synaptophysin levels, occurring before widespread deposition of fibrillar ADan and tau can be observed. Thus, the presence of soluble ADan/mutant BRI(2) can lead to significant changes in tau metabolism and synaptic dysfunction. Our data provide new in vivo insights into the pathogenesis of FDD and the pathogenic pathway(s) by which amyloidogenic peptides, regardless of their primary amino acid sequence, can cause neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1977213893,"Human umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are essential tools for regenerative medicine due to their capacity for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation. As MSCs are found in very small numbers in various tissues, in vitro cell expansion is an essential step that is needed before these cells can be used in clinical applications. Therefore, it is important to identify and characterize factors that are involved in MSC proliferation and apoptosis. In the present study, we focused on Hedgehog (Hh) signaling because several studies have proposed that Hh signaling plays a critical role in controlling the proliferation of stem and progenitor cells. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects on the proliferation and apoptosis of MSCs remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the direct effects of Hh signaling on the proliferation and apoptosis of hUCB-MSCs as well as investigated potential downstream regulatory mechanisms that may be responsible for Hh signaling. We observed that the Hedgehog agonist purmorphamine enhanced cell proliferation and suppressed apoptosis through the RNA-binding protein Msi1 by regulating the expression of an oncoprotein (i.e., c-Myc), a cell cycle regulatory molecule (i.e., p21(CIP1,WAF1)) and two microRNAs (i.e., miRNA-148a and miRNA-148b). This study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms regulating the self-renewal capability of MSCs with relevance to clinical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1994542447,"Nectins are cell adhesion molecules that are widely expressed in the brain. Nectin expression shows a dynamic spatiotemporal regulation, playing a role in neural migratory processes during development. Nectin-1 and nectin-3 and their heterophilic trans-interactions are important for the proper formation of synapses. In the hippocampus, nectin-1 and nectin-3 localize at puncta adherentia junctions and may play a role in synaptic plasticity, a mechanism essential for memory and learning. We evaluated the potential involvement of nectin-1 and nectin-3 in memory consolidation using an emotional learning paradigm. Rats trained for contextual fear conditioning showed transient nectin-1-but not nectin-3-protein upregulation in synapse-enriched hippocampal fractions at about 2 h posttraining. The upregulation of nectin-1 was found exclusively in the ventral hippocampus and was apparent in the synaptoneurosomal fraction. This upregulation was induced by contextual fear conditioning but not by exposure to context or shock alone. When an antibody against nectin-1, R165, was infused in the ventral-hippocampus immediately after training, contextual fear memory was impaired. However, treatment with the antibody in the dorsal hippocampus had no effect in contextual fear memory formation. Similarly, treatment with the antibody in the ventral hippocampus did not interfere with acoustic memory formation. Further control experiments indicated that the effects of ventral hippocampal infusion of the nectin-1 antibody in contextual fear memory cannot be ascribed to memory non-specific effects such as changes in anxiety-like behavior or locomotor behavior. Therefore, we conclude that nectin-1 recruitment to the perisynaptic environment in the ventral hippocampus plays an important role in the formation of contextual fear memories. Our results suggest that these mechanisms could be involved in the connection of emotional and contextual information processed in the amygdala and dorsal hippocampus, respectively, thus opening new venues for the development of treatments to psychopathological alterations linked to impaired contextualization of emotions."

However, it is still unclear how TRPML1 regulates the transport steps implicated by these defects. Identifying proteins that associate with TRPML1 will facilitate the elucidation of its cellular and biochemical functions. We report here two saturation screens for proteins that interact with TRPML1: one that is based on immunoprecipitation/mass spectrometry and the other using a genetic yeast two-hybrid approach. From these screens, we identified largely non-overlapping proteins, which represent potential TRPML1-interactors., Using additional interaction assays on some of the potential interactors from each screen, we validated some proteins as candidate TRPML1 interactors In addition, our analysis indicates that each of the two screens not only identified some false-positive interactors, as expected from any screen, but also failed to uncover potential TRPML1 interactors. Future studies on the true interactors, first identified in these screens, will help elucidate the structure and function of protein complexes containing TRPML1."

CETCs characterization can be used as a liquid biopsy for prognostic and predictive purposes in breast and other cancers. IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 play an important role in tumor growth and the progression of cancer disease. The purpose of the current study was therefore to investigate their expression on CETCs.CETCs were determined from the blood of 50 patients suffering from breast cancer. The number of vital CETCs and the expression of IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 were investigated using the maintrac® method.IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 expression on the surface of CETCs were detected in 84% of patients. A statistically high correlation was found between IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 (r = 0.745 and p<0.001) on the CETCs. The co-expression of both receptors was confirmed in some experiments and ranged between 70% and 100%. Statistically significant correlations were observed between the number of CETCs and IGF-IR (r = 0.315 and p<0.05) and VEGFR-2 (r = 0.310 and p<0.05) expression. The presence of CETCs and the level of IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 expression were not associated with tumor stage, hormone receptor status or nodal/distant metastasis.In this study, a parallel and co-expression of IGF-IR and VEGFR-2 was examined on the surface of CETCs in breast cancer patients for the first time.

However, other important aspects of the proton transport mechanism such as gating, and the ability to occlude protons, are still unclear.

Sensitivity toward orthovanadate was increased when Asn-106 was substituted with an aspartate residue, but decreased in mutants with alanine, lysine, glutamine, or threonine replacement of Asn-106.

Paired cervical and urine samples (n = 204) were taken from HIV-positive women for identifying HPV-DNA presence by using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with three generic primer sets (GP5+/6+, MY09/11 and pU1M/2R). HPV-positive samples were typed for six high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) (HPV-16, -18, -31, -33, -45 and -58) and two low-risk (LR-HPV) (HPV-6/11) types. Agreement between paired sample results and diagnostic performance was evaluated. HPV infection prevalence was 70.6% in cervical and 63.2% in urine samples. HPV-16 was the most prevalent HPV type in both types of sample (66.7% in cervical samples and 62.0% in urine) followed by HPV-31(47.2%) in cervical samples and HPV-58 (35.7%) in urine samples. There was 55.4% coinfection (infection by more than one type of HPV) in cervical samples and 40.2% in urine samples. Abnormal Papanicolau smears were observed in 25.3% of the women, presenting significant association with HPV-DNA being identified in urine samples. There was poor agreement of cervical and urine sample results in generic and type-specific detection of HPV. Urine samples provided the best diagnosis when taking cytological findings as reference. In conclusion including urine samples could be a good strategy for ensuring adherence to screening programs aimed at reducing the impact of cervical cancer, since this sample is easy to obtain and showed good diagnostic performance."
https://openalex.org/W2015620039,"The skull and jaws of extant birds possess secondary cartilage, a tissue that arises after bone formation during embryonic development at articulations, ligamentous and muscular insertions. Using histological analysis, we discovered secondary cartilage in a non-avian dinosaur embryo, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri (Ornithischia, Lambeosaurinae). This finding extends our previous report of secondary cartilage in post-hatching specimens of the same dinosaur species. It provides the first information on the ontogeny of avian and dinosaurian secondary cartilages, and further stresses their developmental similarities. Secondary cartilage was found in an embryonic dentary within a tooth socket where it is hypothesized to have arisen due to mechanical stresses generated during tooth formation. Two patterns were discerned: secondary cartilage is more restricted in location in this Hypacrosaurus embryo, than it is in Hypacrosaurus post-hatchlings; secondary cartilage occurs at far more sites in bird embryos and nestlings than in Hypacrosaurus. This suggests an increase in the number of sites of secondary cartilage during the evolution of birds. We hypothesize that secondary cartilage provided advantages in the fine manipulation of food and was selected over other types of tissues/articulations during the evolution of the highly specialized avian beak from the jaws of their dinosaurian ancestors."
https://openalex.org/W2069752194,"Metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), a prototypical family 3 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), has served as a model for studying GPCR dimerization, and growing evidence has revealed that a glutamate-induced dimeric rearrangement promotes activation of the receptor. However, structural information of the seven-transmembrane domain is severely limited, in contrast to the well studied family 1 GPCRs including rhodopsins and adrenergic receptors. Homology modeling of mGluR8 transmembrane domain with rhodopsin as a template suggested the presence of a conserved water-mediated hydrogen-bonding network between helices VI and VII, which presumably constrains the receptor in an inactive conformation. We therefore conducted a mutational analysis to assess structural similarities between mGluR and family 1 GPCRs. Mutational experiments confirmed that the disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network by T789Y6.43 mutation induced high constitutive activity. Unexpectedly, this high constitutive activity was suppressed by glutamate, the natural agonist ligand, indicating that glutamate acts as a partial inverse agonist to this mutant. Fluorescence energy transfer analysis of T789Y6.43 suggested that the glutamate-induced reduction of the activity originated not from the dimeric rearrangement but from conformational changes within each protomer. Double mutational analysis showed that the specific interaction between Tyr-7896.43 and Gly-8317.45 in T789Y6.43 mutant was important for this phenotype. Therefore, the present study is consistent with the notion that the metabotropic glutamate receptor shares a common activation mechanism with family 1 GPCRs, where rearrangement between helices VI and VII causes the active state formation.

Because GPCRs are major drug targets, their structure-function relationship is a key issue for novel drug design and elucidation of the mechanism of drug action. All GPCRs have a seven-transmembrane domain (TMD) and are classified into several families based on sequence similarity (1Vroling B. Sanders M. Baakman C. Borrmann A. Verhoeven S. Klomp J. Oliveira L. de Vlieg J. Vriend G. GPCRDB: information system for G protein-coupled receptors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D309-D319Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structures of active states of family 1 GPCRs including rhodopsin and adrenergic receptor were published (2Choe H.W. Kim Y.J. Park J.H. Morizumi T. Pai E.F. Krauss N.

Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar), providing important insights into conformational changes in the cytoplasmic side of the TMD. Specifically, it can be speculated that remarkable changes such as the extension of helix V and the outward movement of helix VI are essential for exposing the G protein binding sites. These structural changes are accompanied by the reorganization of hydrogen-bonding networks (HBNs) among helices III, V, VI, and VII including E(D)RY and NPXXY motifs, both of which are highly conserved in family 1 GPCRs. Despite many fundamental advances made in family 1 GPCRs, it is still unclear how common this activation mechanism is among other families. Therefore, in the present study, we examined whether or not similar structural requirements are needed for the active state formation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), a prototypical family 3 GPCR. G protein-coupled receptor l-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate hydrogen-bonding network (2S)-2-amino-2-[(1S,2S)-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl]-3-(xanth-9-yl) propanoic acid metabotropic glutamate receptor transmembrane domain. Homology modeling of the resting state of mGluR8 constructed based on the rhodopsin template predicted the presence of a structural water-mediated HBN between helices VI and VII (Fig. 1a). In family 1 GPCRs, this HBN is considered essential to keep the receptor inactive (4Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y.

U.S.A. 2009; 106: 8555-8560Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and mutations at these loci result in elevated constitutive activity (6Smit M.J. Vischer H.F. Bakker R.A. Jongejan A. Timmerman H. Pardo L. Leurs R. Pharmacogenomic and structural analysis of constitutive g protein-coupled receptor activity.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2007; 47: 53-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We have previously reported a constitutively active mutation, T789A6.43 in mGluR8 (7Yanagawa M. Yamashita T. Shichida Y. Activation switch in the transmembrane domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), which is located in the HBN according to our homology model (superscript numbers represent the Ballesteros and Weinstein nomenclature for GPCRs (8Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Integrated methods for the construction of three-dimensional models and computational probing of structure-function relations in G protein-coupled receptors.Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2465) Google Scholar)). The increased constitutive activity by the disruption of the HBN suggests a common activation mechanism between family 1 and family 3 GPCRs. Therefore, in the present study, we performed comprehensive mutation analysis at this locus to further investigate the role of this region. As a result, we identified an unexpected unique phenotype in T789Y6.43. Our results show that the high constitutive activity of T789Y6.43 was suppressed by glutamate binding; that is, glutamate acts as a partial inverse agonist on T789Y6.43. Further analysis with double mutations suggested that this unique phenotype can be attributed to a specific interaction between Tyr-7896.43 and Gly-8317.45 in T789Y6.43 mutant, which is consistent with a conserved activation mechanism between helices VI and VII in family 1 and family 3 GPCRs. Several studies indicate that dimeric rearrangement of TMDs following the conformational change of the extracellular ligand binding domain is important for the active state formation of mGluRs (9Kunishima N.

Therefore, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analysis to test whether T789Y6.43 affected the glutamate-induced dimeric rearrangement of TMD. The results showed that T789Y6.43 mutant exhibited dimeric rearrangement quite similar to wild-type receptor, suggesting that the unique phenotype in the mutant originated not from different dimeric rearrangement but from a characteristic state of helix VI within each protomer. Taken together, we discuss the model that a proper positional relationship between helices VI and VII within each protomer is a major determinant of the activation of mGluR. [3H]LY341495 (1.28 terabecquerels/mmol) and l-AP4 were purchased from Tocris Cookson. [35S]GTPγS (37 terabecquerels/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Monoclonal anti-GFP and clone GFP-20 mouse ascites fluid were from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by using the QuikChange kit (Agilent Technologies). The mCerulean (15Rizzo M.A. Springer G.H. Granada B. Piston D.W. An improved cyan fluorescent protein variant useful for FRET.Nat.

To detect the expression of mGluR8 by Western blotting analysis, the cDNAs of mGluR8 were tagged with the epitope sequence of the anti-bovine rhodopsin monoclonal antibody Rho1D4 at the C terminus. The wild-type and mutant cDNAs of mGluR8 were introduced into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) or pCAGGS (17Niwa H. Yamamura K. Miyazaki J. Efficient selection for high-expression transfectants with a novel eukaryotic vector.Gene. 1991; 108: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Expression of mGluRs in HEK293S cells was performed by the methods reported previously (13Yanagawa M. Yamashita T. Shichida Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 22971-22981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HEK293S cells were grown to ∼40% confluence in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and were transfected with wild-type or mutant mGluR8 plasmid DNA (10 μg/100-mm dish) using the calcium-phosphate method. The cells were collected by centrifugation 48 h after transfection. The cell membranes were homogenized in 50% sucrose in buffer A (50 mm HEPES (pH 6.5) and 140 mm NaCl) prior to centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted in 2 volumes of buffer A and recentrifuged. Membrane pellets were suspended in buffer B (50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2) for the ligand binding assay and the GTPγS binding assay. For the FRET analysis, the membrane pellets were washed three times for over 2 h with low salt buffer (5 mm HEPES (pH 8.0) and 0.3 mm EDTA) to reduce autofluorescence derived from cell surface proteins. The ligand binding assay was performed according to our previous report (7Yanagawa M. Yamashita T. Shichida Y. Activation switch in the transmembrane domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Displacement by l-AP4 or glutamate of [3H]LY341495 binding to the cell membranes expressing mGluR8 was measured at room temperature. A mixture of membranes (30 μg of total protein), 100 nm [3H]LY341495, and 0–100 μm l-AP4 in buffer B or 0–10 mm glutamate in buffer C (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 140 mm NaCl, 4 mm KOH, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 mm CaCl2) was incubated for 30 min (final assay volume, 20 μl). After incubation, bound and free radioligands were separated by centrifugation. The membrane pellets were washed with buffer B or C and solubilized in 1 m NaOH. The specific binding, defined using 1 mm l-AP4 or 10 mm glutamate as displacer, was ∼93% of total binding estimated using 100 nm [3H]LY341495 and 30 μg of tissue protein. Protein concentration in the membranes was determined by the Bradford method. Competition binding curves were fitted to the one-site binding model: y = (Max-Basal)/(1 + x/IC50) + Basal. The assay of G protein activation by mGluR8 was carried out according to our previous report (18Yamashita T. Terakita A. Kai T. Shichida Y. Conformational change of the transmembrane helices II and IV of metabotropic glutamate receptor involved in G protein activation.J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The mGluR8-containing membranes (final concentration, 2 nm) after sucrose flotation were suspended in 0.03% dodecylmaltoside in buffer D (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, and 3 mm MgCl2) and preincubated with Go-type G protein (final concentration, 200 nm) purified from pig cerebral cortex and the agonist l-AP4 or glutamate. After preincubation for 30 min at 10 °C, the GDP/GTPγS exchange reaction was started by adding GTPγS solution. The assay mixture (20 μl) consisted of 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.015% dodecylmaltoside, 0.03% sodium cholate, 0.8 mg/ml l-α-phosphatidylcholine, 0.1 μm GTPγS, and 3 μm GDP. After incubation for 3 min, the reaction was terminated by adding stop solution (200 μl: 20 mm tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μm GTPγS, and 3 μm GDP) and immediately filtering the sample through a nitrocellulose membrane to trap [35S]GTPγS bound to G proteins. The cellular expression of fluorescence protein-fused mGluR mutants was observed in phosphate-buffered saline on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope with a TE-FM fluorescence attachment as reported in Ref. 13Yanagawa M.

A high pressure mercury lamp (HB 10103AF) with a 450–490-nm band pass filter was used for the excitation of fluorescence proteins, and fluorescence was detected with a 505-nm dichroic mirror and a 520-nm longpass filter (Nikon B-2A filter set). The FRET analysis was performed according to our previous report (13Yanagawa M. Yamashita T. Shichida Y.

Briefly, fluorescence spectra from Cerulean- and Venus-fused mGluRs were recorded at 20 °C with an RF-5300PC spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu). The membrane pellets prepared as described above were resuspended in buffer C and were excited at 433 nm for Cerulean or 500 nm for Venus. To block the scattering, cutoff filters (Y-45 for 433 nm excitation and Y-51 for 500 nm excitation) were placed in front of the detector. Autofluorescence spectra from the membranes containing wild-type mGluRs were also recorded in the same conditions as the base line. We estimated the FRET efficiency and the amount of Cerulean- or Venus-fused mGluRs in co-expressing samples from the base line-corrected fluorescence spectra by “spectra FRET” analysis as described in a previous report (13Yanagawa M. Yamashita T. Shichida Y.

The alignment and the methodology for homology modeling in the present study were identical to the recently published report of mGluR2 that investigated the structural properties of helix VIII using the homology modeling and molecular dynamics simulations (25Bruno A.

Although sequence similarity between family 1 and family 3 GPCRs is very low, several conserved residues can serve as landmarks for sequence alignment (27Pin J.P. Galvez T. Prézeau L.

Membrane-sensitive conformational states of helix 8 in the metabotropic Glu2 receptor, a class C GPCR.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e42023Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In the present study, we created a homology model of the TMD of mGluR8 in its resting and active states to investigate the activation mechanism (see “Experimental Procedures”). The resting state model predicts an ionic lock between Arg-6723.49 and Glu-7796.33 (Fig. 1a), which is consistent with previous mutation analysis of GABAB receptor (28Binet V. Duthey B. Lecaillon J. Vol C. Quoyer J. Labesse G. Pin J.P. Prézeau L. Common structural requirements for heptahelical domain function in class A and class C G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol.

Moreover, a structural water-mediated HBN between helices VI and VII was predicted in the vicinity of highly conserved XPKXY motif that corresponds to the NPXXY motif in the cytoplasmic end of helix VII in family 1 receptors (Fig. 1a). However, these interactions disappeared in the active state model along with the outward movement of helix VI (Fig. 1b). Consequently, Arg-6723.49 was displaced toward the cytoplasmic space, which is considered essential for interaction with G protein (28Binet V. Duthey B. Lecaillon J. Vol C. Quoyer J. Labesse G. Pin J.P. Prézeau L. Common structural requirements for heptahelical domain function in class A and class C G protein-coupled receptors.J. Biol.

Crystal structure of the β2 adrenergic receptor-Gs protein complex.Nature. 2011; 477: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). These models suggest that, like rhodopsin, reorganization of HBNs controls the activation of mGluR, even though sequence similarity is very low across the families. The homology model suggested that Thr-7896.43 is involved in the structural water-mediated HBN between helices VI and VII (Fig. 1a). Our previous study showed that the mutation at Thr-7896.43, which is well conserved among all of the eight human mGluR subtypes, elevated the constitutive activity (7Yanagawa M. Yamashita T. Shichida Y. Activation switch in the transmembrane domain of metabotropic glutamate receptor.Mol. Pharmacol. 2009; 76: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To further investigate the role of this residue, we performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of this constitutively active mutation site. We constructed all 19 mutants at Thr-7896.43 and expressed them in HEK293 cells. The expression level of wild type and the mutants was determined by a ligand binding assay using a membrane preparation. Substitutions with charged amino acid residues (Asp, Glu, His, Lys, and Arg) or Asn resulted in substantial decrease of expression level (Table 1).TABLE 1Relative expression level of the mutants of mGluR8Position mGluR8TM6 (6.43) mean ± S.D.Position mGluR8TM7 mean ± S.D.Position mGluR8TM7+T789Y6.43 mean ± S.D.WT1.00T789G1.00 ± 0.07A826S7.401.02 ± 0.08A826S/T789Y0.97 ± 0.08T789A1.04 ± 0.01S827A7.411.06 ± 0.07S827A/T789Y0.66 ± 0.05T789S1.04 ± 0.02V828A7.421.11 ± 0.07V828A/T789Y0.93 ± 0.04T789C0.99 ± 0.03S829A7.431.26 ± 0.15S829A/T789Y1.15 ± 0.12T789P1.03 ± 0.05L830A7.440.12 ± 0.01L830A/T789Y0.02 ± 0.00T789D0.04 ± 0.00G831A7.451.05 ± 0.09G831A/T789Y0.96 ± 0.07T789N0.02 ± 0.00M832A7.461.03 ± 0.04M832A/T789Y0.93 ± 0.10T789V1.07 ± 0.05L833A7.470.08 ± 0.00L833A/T789Y0.04 ± 0.00T789E0.22 ± 0.12Y834A7.480.77 ± 0.05Y834A/T789Y0.80 ± 0.05T789Q1.02 ± 0.11M835A7.490.84 ± 0.05M835A/T789Y0.96 ± 0.04T789I1.02 ± 0.07P836A7.500.76 ± 0.07P836A/T789Y0.88 ± 0.05T789L1.04 ± 0.03K837A7.510.78 ± 0.06K837A/T789Y0.65 ± 0.03T789M0.87 ± 0.11V838A7.520.88 ± 0.01V838A/T789Y0.94 ± 0.02T789H0.32 ± 0.01Y839A7.530.81 ± 0.09Y839A/T789F1.00 ± 0.07T789K0.47 ± 0.02I840A7.540.95 ± 0.11I840A/T789Y0.87 ± 0.09T789F1.07 ± 0.04T789R0.27 ± 0.09T789Y0.98 ± 0.03T789W0.97 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab G protein activation ability of the mutants whose expression level was >40% of wild type was measured by GTPγS binding assay with or without agonist l-AP4. The constitutive activity was positively correlated with the difference in side chain volume from threonine (r = 0.85, p < 0.01) in all of the mutants except for T789W6.43 (Fig. 2a). Thus, a large change in the side chain volume at this locus increased the constitutive activity. Additionally, when the substituted residue was smaller than threonine, all four mutants showed significant elevation (∼1.5-fold of wild type) of the agonist (l-AP4)-dependent activity (Fig. 2b). However, when the substituted residue was larger than threonine, the agonist-dependent activity was not correlated with side chain volume of the residue (Fig. 2c). Among these mutants, T789Y6.43 showed a unique phenotype. In addition to having the highest constitutive activity, its constitutive activity was partially suppressed by the addition of agonist l-AP4 (Fig. 2c); that is, l-AP4 acted as a partial inverse agonist on T789Y6.43. Previous studies have shown that the intersubunit rearrangement of mGluR dimer can be estimated by FRET analysis using two GFP variants (12Tateyama M. Abe H. Nakata H. Saito O"
https://openalex.org/W2001451060,"Astrocytes form extensive intercellular networks through gap junctions to support both biochemical and electrical coupling between adjacent cells. ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels couple cell metabolic state to membrane excitability and are enriched in glial cells. Activation of astrocytic mitochondrial KATP (mitoKATP) channel regulates certain astrocytic functions. However, less is known about its impact on electrical coupling between directly coupled astrocytes ex vivo. By using dual patch clamp recording, we found that activation of mitoKATP channel increased the electrical coupling ratio in brain slices. The electrical coupling ratio started to increase 3 min after exposure to Diazoxide, a mitoKATP channel activator, peaked at 5 min, and maintained its level with little adaptation until the end of the 10-min treatment. Blocking the mitoKATP channel with 5-hydroxydecanoate, inhibited electrical coupling immediately, and by 10-min, the ratio dropped by 71% of the initial level. Activation of mitoKATP channel also decreased the latency time of the transjunctional currents by 50%. The increase in the coupling ratio resulting from the activation of the mitoKATP channel in a single astrocyte was further potentiated by the concurrent inhibiting of the channel on the recipient astrocyte. Furthermore, Meclofenamic acid, a gap-junction inhibitor which completely blocked the tracer coupling, hardly reversed the impact of mitoKATP channel's activation on electrical coupling (by 7%). The level of mitochondrial Connexin43, a gap junctional subunit, significantly increased by 70% in astrocytes after 10-min Diazoxide treatment. Phospho-ERK signals were detected in Connexin43 immunoprecipitates in the Diazoxide-treated astrocytes, but not untreated control samples. Finally, inhibiting ERK could attenuate the effects of Diazoxide on electrical coupling by 61%. These findings demonstrate that activation of astrocytic mitoKATP channel upregulates electrical coupling between hippocampal astrocytes ex vivo. In addition, this effect is mainly via up-regulation of the Connexin43-constituted gap junction coupling by an ERK-dependent mechanism in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2011059964,"The structure, functioning and dynamics of polar marine ecosystems are strongly influenced by the extent of sea ice. Ice algae and pelagic phytoplankton represent the primary sources of nutrition for higher trophic-level organisms in seasonally ice-covered areas, but their relative contributions to polar marine consumers remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated the potential of diatom-specific lipid markers and highly branched isoprenoids (HBIs) for estimating the importance of these two carbon pools in an Antarctic pelagic ecosystem. Using GC-MS analysis, we studied HBI biomarkers in key marine species over three years in Adélie Land, Antarctica: euphausiids (ice krill Euphausia crystallorophias and Antarctic krill E. superba), fish (bald notothens Pagothenia borchgrevinki and Antarctic silverfish Pleuragramma antarcticum) and seabirds (Adélie penguins Pygoscelis adeliae, snow petrels Pagodroma nivea and cape petrels Daption capense). This study provides the first evidence of the incorporation of HBI lipids in Antarctic pelagic consumers. Specifically, a di-unsaturated HBI (diene) of sea ice origin was more abundant in ice-associated species than in pelagic species, whereas a tri-unsaturated HBI (triene) of phytoplanktonic origin was more abundant in pelagic species than in ice-associated species. Moreover, the relative abundances of diene and triene in seabird tissues and eggs were higher during a year of good sea ice conditions than in a year of poor ice conditions. In turn, the higher contribution of ice algal derived organic matter to the diet of seabirds was related to earlier breeding and higher breeding success. HBI biomarkers are a promising tool for estimating the contribution of organic matter derived from ice algae in pelagic consumers from Antarctica."
https://openalex.org/W2009012191,"A series of trans-3-aryl acrylic acids 1-27 and their derivatives 28-34 were prepared and evaluated for their antiviral activity against tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) for the first time. The bioassay results showed that most of these compounds exhibited good antiviral activity against TMV, of which compounds 1, 5, 6, 20, 27 and 34 exhibited significantly higher activity against TMV than commercial Ribavirin both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these compounds have more simple structure than commercial Ribavirin, and can be synthesized more efficiently. These new findings demonstrate that trans-3-aryl acrylic acids and their derivatives represent a new template for antiviral studies and could be considered for novel therapy against plant virus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2041337181,"The properties of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I(h)) were investigated in rat periglomerular dopaminergic neurons using patch-clamp recordings in thin slices. A reliable identification of single dopaminergic neurons was made possible by use of a transgenic line of mice expressing eGFP under the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter. At 37 °C and minimizing the disturbance of the intracellular milieu with perforated patches, this current shows a midpoint of activation around -82.7 mV, with a significant level of opening already at rest, thereby giving a substantial contribution to the resting potential, and ultimately playing a relevant function in the control of the cell excitability. The blockage of I(h) has a profound influence on the spontaneous firing of these neurons, which result as strongly depressed. However the effect is not due to a direct role of the current in the pacemaker process, but to the I(h) influence on the resting membrane potential. I(h) kinetics is sensitive to the intracellular levels of cAMP, whose increase promotes a shift of the activation curve towards more positive potentials. The direct application of DA and 5-HT neurotransmitters, physiologically released onto bulbar dopaminergic neurons and known to act on metabotropic receptors coupled to the cAMP pathway, do not modifythe I(h) amplitude. On the contrary, noradrenaline almost halves the I(h) amplitude. Our data indicate that the HCN channels do not participate directly to the pacemaker activity of periglomerular dopaminergic neurons, but influence their resting membrane potential by controlling the excitability profile of these cells, and possibly affecting the processing of sensory information taking place at the entry of the bulbar circuitry."
https://openalex.org/W2013726310,"The inefficiency of generating induced pluripotent somatic cells (iPS) engendered two contending models, namely the Stochastic model and Elite model. Although the former is more favorable to explain the inherent inefficiencies, it may be fallible to extrapolate the same working model to reprogramming of cancer cells. Indeed, tumor cells are known to be inherently heterogeneous with respect to distinctive characteristics thus providing a suitable platform to test whether the reprogramming process of cancer cells is biased. Here, we report our observations that all randomly picked induced pluripotent cancer cells (iPCs) established previously do not possess mutations known in the parental population. This unanticipated observation is most parsimoniously explained by the Elite model, whereby putative early tumor progenies were selected during induction to pluripotency."
https://openalex.org/W2037185090,"Plants respond to different forms of stresses by inducing transcription of a common and distinct set of genes by concerted actions of a cascade of transcription regulators. We previously reported that a gene, CaZF encoding a C2H2-zinc finger family protein from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) imparted high salinity tolerance when expressed in tobacco plants. We report here that in addition to promoting tolerance against dehydration, salinity and high temperature, the CaZF overexpressing plants exhibited similar phenotype of growth and development like the plants overexpressing CAP2, encoding an AP2-family transcription factor from chickpea. To investigate any relationship between these two genes, we performed gene expression analysis in the overexpressing plants, promoter-reporter analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation. A number of transcripts that exhibited enhanced accumulation upon expression of CAP2 or CaZF in tobacco plants were found common. Transient expression of CAP2 in chickpea leaves resulted in increased accumulation of CaZF transcript. Gel mobility shift and transient promoter-reporter assays suggested that CAP2 activates CaZF promoter by interacting with C-repeat elements (CRTs) in CaZF promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay demonstrated an in vivo interaction of CAP2 protein with CaZF promoter."
https://openalex.org/W2154307751,"The absence of Dam in Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis causes a defect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pattern associated to a reduced expression of wzz gene. Wzz is the chain length regulator of the LPS O-antigen. Here we investigated whether Dam regulates wzz gene expression through its two known regulators, PmrA and RcsB. Thus, the expression of rcsB and pmrA was monitored by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting using fusions with 3×FLAG tag in wild type (wt) and dam strains of S. Enteritidis. Dam regulated the expression of both rcsB and pmrA genes; nevertheless, the defect in LPS pattern was only related to a diminished expression of RcsB. Interestingly, regulation of wzz in serovar Enteritidis differed from that reported earlier for serovar Typhimurium; RcsB induces wzz expression in both serovars, whereas PmrA induces wzz in S. Typhimurium but represses it in serovar Enteritidis. Moreover, we found that in S. Enteritidis there is an interaction between both wzz regulators: RcsB stimulates the expression of pmrA and PmrA represses the expression of rcsB. Our results would be an example of differential regulation of orthologous genes expression, providing differences in phenotypic traits between closely related bacterial serovars."
https://openalex.org/W2039647914,"The mitochondrial genome maintenance gene, MGM101, is essential for yeasts that depend on mitochondrial DNA replication. Previously, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it has been found that the carboxy-terminal two-thirds of Mgm101p has a functional core. Furthermore, there is a high level of amino acid sequence conservation in this region from widely diverse species. By contrast, the amino-terminal region, that is also essential for function, does not have recognizable conservation. Using a bioinformatic approach we find that the functional core from yeast and a corresponding region of Mgm101p from the coral Acropora millepora have an ordered structure, while the N-terminal domains of sequences from yeast and coral are predicted to be disordered. To examine whether ordered and disordered domains of Mgm101p have specific or general functions we made chimeric proteins from yeast and coral by swapping the two regions. We find, by an in vivo assay in S.cerevisiae, that the ordered domain of A.millepora can functionally replace the yeast core region but the disordered domain of the coral protein cannot substitute for its yeast counterpart. Mgm101p is found in the mitochondrial nucleoid along with enzymes and proteins involved in mtDNA replication. By attaching green fluorescent protein to the N-terminal disordered domain of yeast Mgm101p we find that GFP is still directed to the mitochondrial nucleoid where full-length Mgm101p-GFP is targeted."
https://openalex.org/W2086796930,"Sex ratio of adults (tertiary sex ratio, TSR) is a major feature of animal populations with consequences for their behaviour, genetic structure and viability. Spatial and temporal variation in TSR occurs within species but the mechanisms behind it are poorly understood. In this long-term study of a declining population of a socially monogamous, colonial, migratory bird, the barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), we first analyzed population-level variation in TSR ( = proportion of males) of yearlings at sexual maturation in relation to ecological conditions as gauged by annual survival rate of adults. TSR was male-biased both among yearlings and older individuals, but male bias of yearlings was more pronounced after years with larger decline in adult survival. Thus, male offspring were less susceptible to the adverse ecological conditions that cause increased mortality. Dispersal and settling site decisions can have major consequences on fitness via the effects of local TSR on mating and sperm competition. Breeding barn swallows are highly philopatric while natal dispersal is high and, together with mortality, is the main determinant of colony TSR. We thus also investigated the mechanisms of breeding colony choice by yearlings and found that TSR of new-settlers in a given colony and year was negatively predicted by TSR of returning, early arriving older individuals in that year, but not by overall TSR at the colony in the previous year. This suggests that in our male-biased population new-settler males respond to local TSR upon arrival to choose the sites with larger breeding opportunities. Hence, variation in ecological conditions as reflected by adult survival can shift the TSR of individuals recruiting into a local population, with potentially various demographic consequences. However, breeding site choice based on TSR tends to homogenize TSR at a population level likely by facilitating settling of dispersing males in colonies with less male-biased TSR."
