https://openalex.org/W2037045595,"Diatoms, a type of microscopic marine and freshwater alga, dominate the oceans and are responsible for about a fifth of the primary productivity on Earth. The complete genome sequence of Phaeodactylum tricornutum is reported in this issue, the second diatom to be sequenced. Comparisons with Thalassiosira pseudonana, the first, reveal that hundreds of diatom genes have been acquired by gene transfer from bacteria — or vice versa. Gene transfer appears to have been common during diatom evolution, creating unorthodox combinations of genes — including some from plants and animals — likely to play major roles in nutrient management and environmental signalling. Diatoms are photosynthetic secondary endosymbionts found throughout marine and freshwater environments, and are believed to be responsible for around one-fifth of the primary productivity on Earth1,2. The genome sequence of the marine centric diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana was recently reported, revealing a wealth of information about diatom biology3,4,5. Here we report the complete genome sequence of the pennate diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum and compare it with that of T. pseudonana to clarify evolutionary origins, functional significance and ubiquity of these features throughout diatoms. In spite of the fact that the pennate and centric lineages have only been diverging for 90 million years, their genome structures are dramatically different and a substantial fraction of genes (∼40%) are not shared by these representatives of the two lineages. Analysis of molecular divergence compared with yeasts and metazoans reveals rapid rates of gene diversification in diatoms. Contributing factors include selective gene family expansions, differential losses and gains of genes and introns, and differential mobilization of transposable elements. Most significantly, we document the presence of hundreds of genes from bacteria. More than 300 of these gene transfers are found in both diatoms, attesting to their ancient origins, and many are likely to provide novel possibilities for metabolite management and for perception of environmental signals. These findings go a long way towards explaining the incredible diversity and success of the diatoms in contemporary oceans."

In this study, in order to dissect the patterns of microRNA-disease associations, we performed a comprehensive analysis to the human microRNA-disease association data, which is manually collected from publications. We built a human microRNA associated disease network. Interestingly, microRNAs tend to show similar or different dysfunctional evidences for the similar or different disease clusters, respectively. A negative correlation between the tissue-specificity of a microRNA and the number of diseases it associated was uncovered. Furthermore, we observed an association between microRNA conservation and disease. Finally, we uncovered that microRNAs associated with the same disease tend to emerge as predefined microRNA groups. These findings can not only provide help in understanding the associations between microRNAs and human diseases but also suggest a new way to identify novel disease-associated microRNAs."

https://openalex.org/W2060275730,"Neuroblastoma is the most common childhood cancer. There is a strong familial association and it was predicted over 30 years ago that there was a genetic element to the disease. Four groups now report the identification of mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) in neuroblastoma patients. ALK acts as a neuroblastoma predisposition gene, and somatic point mutations occur in sporadic neuroblastoma cases. These mutations promote ALK's kinase activity and can transform cells and display tumorigenic activity in vivo. ALK inhibitors decrease neuroblastoma cell proliferation, so have potential as anticancer drugs. This is one of four papers in this issue that identifies mutations in the tyrosine kinase receptor ALK in neuroblastoma, the most frequent childhood cancer. ALK is found to be a neuroblastoma predisposition gene and somatic points mutations were found in sporadic cases of neuroblastoma. These mutations lead the ALK kinase activation and are able to transform cells and display tumourigenic activity in vivo. ALK inhibitors decrease neuroblastoma cell proliferating and are potential anti-cancer drugs for the treatment of neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer1. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal2,3. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2062159891,"A potential treatment for paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury is to route control signals from the brain around the injury by artificial connections. Such signals could then control electrical stimulation of muscles, thereby restoring volitional movement to paralysed limbs. In previously separate experiments, activity of motor cortex neurons related to actual or imagined movements has been used to control computer cursors and robotic arms, and paralysed muscles have been activated by functional electrical stimulation. Here we show that Macaca nemestrina monkeys can directly control stimulation of muscles using the activity of neurons in the motor cortex, thereby restoring goal-directed movements to a transiently paralysed arm. Moreover, neurons could control functional stimulation equally well regardless of any previous association to movement, a finding that considerably expands the source of control signals for brain-machine interfaces. Monkeys learned to use these artificial connections from cortical cells to muscles to generate bidirectional wrist torques, and controlled multiple neuron-muscle pairs simultaneously. Such direct transforms from cortical activity to muscle stimulation could be implemented by autonomous electronic circuitry, creating a relatively natural neuroprosthesis. These results are the first demonstration that direct artificial connections between cortical cells and muscles can compensate for interrupted physiological pathways and restore volitional control of movement to paralysed limbs."
https://openalex.org/W1968636401,"Most proteins are secreted from bacteria by the interaction of the cytoplasmic SecA ATPase with a membrane channel, formed by the heterotrimeric SecY complex. Here we report the crystal structure of SecA bound to the SecY complex, with a maximum resolution of 4.5 ångström (A), obtained for components from Thermotoga maritima. One copy of SecA in an intermediate state of ATP hydrolysis is bound to one molecule of the SecY complex. Both partners undergo important conformational changes on interaction. The polypeptide-cross-linking domain of SecA makes a large conformational change that could capture the translocation substrate in a 'clamp'. Polypeptide movement through the SecY channel could be achieved by the motion of a 'two-helix finger' of SecA inside the cytoplasmic funnel of SecY, and by the coordinated tightening and widening of SecA's clamp above the SecY pore. SecA binding generates a 'window' at the lateral gate of the SecY channel and it displaces the plug domain, preparing the channel for signal sequence binding and channel opening."
https://openalex.org/W1982765286,"Asymmetric division of adult stem cells generates one self-renewing stem cell and one differentiating cell, thereby maintaining tissue homeostasis. A decline in stem cell function has been proposed to contribute to tissue ageing, although the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Here we show that changes in the stem cell orientation with respect to the niche during ageing contribute to the decline in spermatogenesis in the male germ line of Drosophila. Throughout the cell cycle, centrosomes in germline stem cells (GSCs) are oriented within their niche and this ensures asymmetric division. We found that GSCs containing misoriented centrosomes accumulate with age and that these GSCs are arrested or delayed in the cell cycle. The cell cycle arrest is transient, and GSCs appear to re-enter the cell cycle on correction of centrosome orientation. On the basis of these findings, we propose that cell cycle arrest associated with centrosome misorientation functions as a mechanism to ensure asymmetric stem cell division, and that the inability of stem cells to maintain correct orientation during ageing contributes to the decline in spermatogenesis. We also show that some of the misoriented GSCs probably originate from dedifferentiation of spermatogonia."
https://openalex.org/W2164463504,"Cellular migration is a fundamental process linked to diverse pathological states such as diabetes and its complications, atherosclerosis, inflammation, and cancer. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a multiligand cell surface macromolecule which binds distinct ligands that accumulate in these settings. RAGE-ligand interaction evokes central changes in key biological properties of cells, including proliferation, generation of inflammatory mediators, and migration. Although RAGE-dependent signal transduction is critically dependent on its short cytoplasmic domain, to date the proximate mechanism by which this RAGE domain engages and stimulates cytoplasmic signaling pathways has yet to be identified. Here we show that the RAGE cytoplasmic domain interacts with Diaphanous-1 (Dia-1) both in vitro and in vivo. We employed the human RAGE cytoplasmic domain as “bait” in the yeast two-hybrid assay and identified the formin homology (FH1) domain of Dia-1 as a potential binding partner of this RAGE domain. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that the RAGE cytoplasmic domain interacts with the FH1 domain of Dia-1. Down-regulation of Dia-1 expression by RNA interference blocks RAGE-mediated activation of Rac-1 and Cdc42 and, in parallel, RAGE ligand-stimulated cellular migration. Taken together, these findings indicate that the interaction of the RAGE cytoplasmic domain with Dia-1 is required to transduce extracellular environmental cues evoked by binding of RAGE ligands to their cell surface receptor, a chief consequence of which is Rac-1 and Cdc42 activation and cellular migration. Because RAGE and Dia-1 are implicated in the regulation of inflammatory, vascular, and transformed cell migration, these findings highlight this interaction as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in inflammation, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer.

Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that activation of RAGE mediates key effects in cellular and in vivo systems. First, ligand-RAGE interaction stimulates cellular motility (7Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C. Qu W. Tanji N. Lu Y. Lalla E. Fu C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M. Lu A.

Second, a number of signal transduction cascades are activated upon ligand-RAGE interaction, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Jak/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription), and importantly, the Rho GTPases Rac-1 and Cdc42 (2Hofmann M.A. Drury S.

To date, however, the precise molecular mechanism(s) underlying the diverse repertoire of RAGE signaling has yet to be identified. Intriguingly, the cytosolic domain of RAGE lacks endogenous tyrosine kinase activity or any known motifs involved in receptor signaling. Here, we hypothesized that the binding partner(s) of the RAGE cytoplasmic domain may represent a novel mechanism to stimulate signal transduction and thereby mediate pivotal changes in cellular properties linked to disease states. To establish the precise mechanisms by which the RAGE cytoplasmic domain stimulates cell signaling, we employed the yeast two-hybrid system and report that this domain of RAGE interacts with Diaphanous-1, which we confirmed by multiple in vitro and in vivo methodology. In vivo, RAGE-mediated activation of Rac-1 and Cdc42 and cellular migration is dependent on Dia-1. These studies elucidate a novel signaling paradigm by which extracellular cues stimulated by RAGE ligand binding are transduced through the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor via Dia-1 to stimulate fundamental signaling networks and cell migration. Cell Lines and Materials—Rat C6 glioma cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL-107) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). SK-BR-3 cells were obtained from ATCC (HTB-30) and maintained in McCoy's 5A media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). RAGE ligand carboxyl methyl lysine (CML)-human serum albumin (HSA) was prepared by the incubation of HSA (25 mg/ml), sodium cyanoborohydride (10 mm) in sodium phosphate buffer (0.2 m; pH 7.8) and glyoxylic acid at 37 °C for 24 h followed by dialysis. CML modification was characterized using 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Endotoxin levels evaluated by chromogenic Limulus assay (Associates of Cape Cod, Inc.) amounted to <0.002 enzyme units/mg of protein in the experimental preparations. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The Matchmaker Two-Hybrid System 2 was used to screen a human lung Matchmaker cDNA library (BD Clontech) with the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE used as bait (corresponding to amino acids 361-404 following the transmembrane domain (GenBank™ accession number AY755619)). To construct the bait plasmid, DNA encoding the RAGE cytoplasmic domain was cloned in-frame with the GAL4 DNA-BD of the pAS2-1 vector (BD Clontech). The yeast strain Y190 was co-transformed with the lung cDNA library (cloned into the GAL4 activation domain of the vector pACT2 (BD Clontech)) and the pAS2-1-RAGE-cytoplasmic domain clone. Colonies that grew successfully on the selective media SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp were screened further for reporter gene ;-galactosidase expression by the colony-lift filter assay. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive clones and transformed into Escherichia coli-competent cells to enable isolation and sequencing. Plasmid DNA was sequenced, and clones were identified by BLAST searches (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Multiple clones were identified encoding a fragment of the Dia-1 gene corresponding to GenBank™ accession number AF051782. The yeast two-hybrid clone sequence was submitted to GenBank™ (accession number DQ067452). hDia-1 Full-length cDNA Cloning—To clone the full-length cDNA of Dia-1, the start (5′ end/transcription start site) and finish (3′ end/polyadenylation site) of the human diaphanous mRNA was determined by RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). Human lung mRNA (BD Clontech) was prepared for reverse transcription with GeneRacer to allow selection of only full-length mRNAs according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA end-treated lung mRNA was reverse-transcribed using Thermoscript cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using the GeneRacer Oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen). To amplify the 5′/3′ end of Dia-1, primers were designed on the sense/antisense strand to amplify from within the fragment isolated from the yeast two-hybrid to capture the respective 5′/3′ end. The 5′ end/transcription start site was identified by performing PCR using the GeneRacer 5′ primer (Invitrogen) and a Dia-1-specific 3′ Primer (Dia-5RACE1, 5′-GGCAAAGAAGAGGGTGAAGGGAT-3′) followed by a nested PCR using the GeneRacer 5′ Nested Primer (Invitrogen) and a Dia-1-specific 3′-nested primer (Dia1-5RACE2, 5′-CAGGTAAAGAAGGGGGTGAGGAGA-3′). Similarly, the 3′ end/polyadenylation site was determined using a Dia-1-specific 5′ primer (Dia1-3RACE1, 5′-TATGCCTCCACCTCCCCCATTT-3′) and the GeneRacer 3′ primer (Invitrogen) followed by a nested PCR with Dia-1-specific 5′ primer (Dia-3RACE2, 5′-GCAGCCCCAGTTCTGCCATTT-3′) and the GeneRacer 3′-nested primer (Invitrogen). PCRs were performed with Platinum Taq High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) using a PTC-200 thermocycler (MJ Research). Purified RACE-amplified PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning system (Invitrogen), and the plasmid DNA was purified by QIAprep Spin Mini-prep (Qiagen). Plasmid DNA was sequenced using the plasmid-specific primers M13F(-20) and M13R and sequenced on a ABI 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Using the lung cDNA used in RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments, PCR was performed using Dia1-5′ (GTGAACCGGGACATGGAGCC) and Dia1-3′ (GTCAGCGAGCAGGGAGGAGGT), and the resultant PCR product was cloned using the TA TOPO Cloning System (Invitrogen). Cloned Dia-1 cDNA was sequenced using multiple overlapping primers in 500-bp steps to verify the correct sequence of the cloned cDNAs. The resulting full-length Dia-1 cDNA sequence was deposited in GenBank™ as accession number DQ067453. RAGE/Dia-1 Interaction Studies and in Vitro Binding Assay—The RAGE cytoplasmic domain cDNA (as used for yeast two-hybrid) was cloned in-frame with the GST tag (N terminus tag) in the vector pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). hDia-YIIH was cloned in-frame with the His6 tag (N terminus tag) in the vector pRSET (Invitrogen). All constructs were sequenced to ensure that RAGE and Dia-1 were in-frame with the epitope tags. GST-RAGE tail/GST empty vector was transformed into BL21(DE3) E. coli (Invitrogen), and expression was induced using 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-;-d-galactopyranoside. Because of low levels of expression in bacteria, His-hDia-YIIH/His empty vector was expressed using the TNT® Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Pulldown assays were performed by using the Profound GST Pull-Down Interaction kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Proteins were detected by either Coomassie Blue or by Western blot. Western blotting was performed using 4-12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel with MOPS buffer (Invitrogen), nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen), incubation with anti-HisG antibodies (Invitrogen), or streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Promega). Protein signal was detected using ECL reagent (GE Healthcare) and exposed to x-ray film. RAGE/Dia-1 Interaction Studies and Coimmunoprecipitation of the Epitope-tagged RAGE Cytoplasmic Domain and hDia-1—The RAGE cytoplasmic domain and hDia-1 were cloned into epitope tag vectors to allow immunoprecipitation studies to be performed with antibodies independent of RAGE and hDia-1. The RAGE cytoplasmic domain cDNA (as used for yeast two-hybrid) was cloned in-frame with the His6 tag (N terminus tag) in the vector pcDNA4-HisMax (Invitrogen). Dia-1 full-length cDNA was cloned in-frame with the Myc6 tag (N terminus tag) in the vector pCS2+MT (provided by Jan Kitajewski, Columbia University). All constructs were sequenced to ensure the RAGE and Dia-1 were in-frame with the epitope tags. SK-BR-3 cells were seeded overnight at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in complete media and transfected with His-RAGE-cytoplasmic domain and Myc-hDia-1 using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Negative controls were included to assess for nonspecific interaction by transfecting separate dishes of cells with His-RAGE-cytoplasmic domain/pcS2-MT empty and Myc-Diaphanous/pcDNA4-HisMax empty. After 48 h cells were stimulated with 10 ;g/ml CML-HSA for 1 h, rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed using MPER lysis buffer (Pierce) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete Protease Inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). After scraping, cellular debris was pelleted, and immunoprecipitation was performed with 500 ;g of cell lysate and 1 ;g of anti-HisG/Myc (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of protein A/G agarose (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-agarose was pelleted and washed three times using MPER lysis buffer followed by resuspension in NuPAGE sample buffer and reducing reagent (Invitrogen) for electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed as described above using anti-HisG or anti-Myc monoclonal antibodies (Invitrogen). RAGE/Dia-1 Interaction Studies: Immunoprecipitation of Full-length and DN-RAGE to Test for RAGE/Dia-1 Interaction—Full-length RAGE cDNA (1Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C.P.

DN-RAGE was generated using PCR by inserting a stop codon into the cDNA sequence of human RAGE at the end of the transmembrane domain (amino acid number 361) to remove the cytoplasmic tail. Subsequently PCR was performed as for full-length RAGE using the RAGE 5′-UTR1 primer and a reverse primer (RAGE-DNr, 5′-CTTGCCACTAGATGACCCC-3′) and cloned into pcDNA3.1. C6 cells were stably transfected with human full-length (RAGE), cytoplasmic domain-deleted RAGE (DN-RAGE), or empty pcDNA3.1 (mock-transfected) constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and by selection with neomycin (G418). Stable clones were screened for RAGE/DN-RAGE expression by Western blot using anti-RAGE IgG (1Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C.P. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAGE and DN-RAGE C6 stable cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish in complete media and grown for 24 h before starvation overnight in serum-free media. Cells were stimulated with 10 ;g/ml CML-HSA for 30 min, and cell lysis was performed as above. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 1 ;g of monoclonal mouse anti-human RAGE antibody (Chemicon) with all conditions the same as above. Western blots were prepared as above and blotted with monoclonal mouse anti-human Dia-1 antibody (BD Pharmingen). RAGE/Dia-1 Interaction Studies: Confocal Microscopy—Mock- and RAGE-transfected C6 cells were seeded at 1 × 104 cells/well of 4-chamber culture slides (BD Biosciences) and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells were starved overnight and stimulated with 10 ;g/ml CML-HSA for 30 min. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde solution, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, permeabilized, and blocked with 0. 1% Triton X-100 in CAS-block (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Double antibody confocal microscopy was performed by incubating cells with mouse anti-Dia-1 (BD Pharmingen) overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with rabbit anti-RAGE (1Neeper M. Schmidt A.M. Brett J. Yan S.D. Wang F. Pan Y.C.P. Elliston K. Stern D. Shaw A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14998-15004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biotinylated secondary antibodies (anti-mouse and anti-rabbit biotin) were incubated sequentially between primary antibody incubations for 30 min each followed by incubation with streptavidin conjugate Alexa Fluor 488 or Alexa Fluor 555, respectively (Invitrogen). Slides were mounted with Vectorshield mounting media (Vector) and observed with an oil immersion objective using a Nikon E800 microscope. Images were collected using a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 Confocal System and the Lasersharp 2000 software (Bio-Rad). Construction of hDia-1 Mutants—hDia-1 truncation mutants including hDia-FH1 and hDia-RhoBD were created from wild-type Myc-hDia-1 using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) by introducing stop codons at amino acid numbers 786 (hDia-FH1) and 253 (hDia-RhoBD). Myc-hDia-YIIH was generated by subcloning hDia-YIIH into the Myc-tag vector pCMV-Myc (BD Clontech). Coimmunoprecipitation of the Epitope-tagged RAGE Cytoplasmic Domain and hDia-1 Mutants—His-RAGE-cytoplasmic domain and Myc-hDia-1 constructs (hDia-1, hDia-FH1, hDia-YIIH, hDia-RhoBD, empty Myc vector) were transfected into SK-BR-3 cells, and immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described above with anti-His/Myc antibodies. Cellular Migration Assays—Chemotaxis assays were performed using the QCM Colorimetric Cell Migration Assay (Chemicon). Cells were seeded per upper chamber fitted with a lower 8-;m porous polycarbonate membrane, and the insert was placed in the lower chamber of a 24-well dish containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and no-stimulant, CML-HSA RAGE-ligand, or 10% fetal bovine serum (control) and incubated at 37 °C for 5 h according to the manufacturer's instructions (Chemicon). Cells migrated through the porous membrane were incubated with Cell Stain Solution (Chemicon) followed by representative counts of four randomly selected microscope fields. In other studies a distinct RAGE ligand, S100B (Calbiochem), was used to stimulate cells. GTPase Activation Assays—The activation of GTPases was investigated using EZ-Detect Rac-1, Cdc42, and RhoA activation kits (Pierce). C6 RAGE and RAGE-DN cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells per 100-mm dish and grown for 24 h. Cells were starved for 24 h by replacing media with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no fetal bovine serum. RAGE and RAGE-DN cells were incubated with/without CML-HSA for 1, 5, 15, and 30 min at 37 °C to stimulate GTPase activation. Activated GTPases were purified using the EZ-Detect Rac-1, Cdc42, and RhoA activation kits (Pierce). The amount of GTP-bound Rac-1, Cdc42, and RhoA and the total amount of Rac-1, Cdc42, and RhoA in cell lysates was determined by Western blot with respective antibodies. GTPases and Migration Assays—Migration assays were performed with dominant negative constructs of Rac1 (N17), Cdc42 (N17), RhoA (N19) (Millipore), and vector alone (Millipore) by cotransfection with the GFP expression vector pMaxGFP (Amaxa) into C6-RAGE cells as described above. Cells were subjected to migration assays as above, and numbers of migrating cells were calculated by counting GFP-positive cells that had passed through the porous membrane. Dia-1 siRNA—Predesigned Stealth™ Select RNA interference was obtained from Invitrogen corresponding to rat Dia-1 (5′-GAACCAGAAGGAGAGUUCCAGGUCU-3′) and matched RNA interference negative controls (scramble siRNA). To validate Dia-1 knockdown, Dia-1 and control siRNA was transfected into RAGE C6 cells, seeded at 1 × 106 cells/100 mm dish using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and Dia-1 levels assessed by both quantitative PCR and Western blot. To analyze the mRNA levels of Dia-1, RNA was isolated from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed using the Superscript III reverse transcription-PCR system (Invitrogen). Quantitative-PCR analysis was subsequently performed for Dia-1 levels using Dia-1 Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems), normalized to ribosomal 18 S using the 18 S probe (Applied Biosystems), and analyzed on an Mx3005P real-time PCR system (Stratagene). Protein levels of Dia-1 were detected by Western blot analysis on cell lysates, normalized by correcting to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels (Chemicon). Dia-1 siRNA and Migration Assays—To enable quantification of Dia-1/scramble siRNA-transfected cell migration, C6-RAGE cells were cotransfected with siRNA and pMaxGFP expression vector with knockdown of Dia-1 levels assessed using immunofluorescence as described above. Migration assays were performed using siRNA/GFP-cotransfected cells as described above. Dia-1 Rac-1/Cdc42 Activation Assays—C6-RAGE cells were transfected with Dia-1/scramble siRNA, and Rac-1 activation was assessed using the EZ Detect Rac-1 and Cdc42 activation kit (Pierce) as described above. Statistical Analyses—In all experiments, unless otherwise indicated, data are reported as the mean ± S.D. in at least three replicates per group. Data were analyzed by post hoc comparisons using 2-tailed t test, and a p value less than or equal to 0.05 was considered significant. Identification of Dia-1 as a Binding Partner of the RAGE Cytoplasmic Domain Using the Yeast Two-hybrid System—To understand how the RAGE cytoplasmic domain interacts with the intracellular partner(s) to stimulate signal transduction, we screened a yeast two-hybrid human lung cDNA library using the human RAGE cytoplasmic domain as bait. By this approach we identified a potential interaction of the RAGE cytoplasmic domain with human Diaphanous-1 (herein denoted hDia-1), a member of the formin protein family, defined by two key formin homology (FH) domains, FH1 and FH2 (16Higgs H.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 342-353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The proline-rich FH1 domain of Dia-1 interacts with mediators of the actin cytoskeleton (profilin) and various signal transduction pathway molecules, such as c-src, SH3 domain-containing BAIAP2, and DIP, to mediate cellular movement (17Krebs A.

https://openalex.org/W2126816262,"The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) plays an important role in both the peripheral and central nervous systems. The biosynthesis of serotonin is regulated by two rate-limiting enzymes, tryptophan hydroxylase-1 and -2 (TPH1 and TPH2). We used a gene-targeting approach to generate mice with selective and complete elimination of the two known TPH isoforms. This resulted in dramatically reduced central 5-HT levels in Tph2 knockout (TPH2KO) and Tph1/Tph2 double knockout (DKO) mice; and substantially reduced peripheral 5-HT levels in DKO, but not TPH2KO mice. Therefore, differential expression of the two isoforms of TPH was reflected in corresponding depletion of 5-HT content in the brain and periphery. Surprisingly, despite the prominent and evolutionarily ancient role that 5-HT plays in both vertebrate and invertebrate physiology, none of these mutations resulted in an overt phenotype. TPH2KO and DKO mice were viable and normal in appearance. Behavioral alterations in assays with predictive validity for antidepressants were among the very few phenotypes uncovered. These behavioral changes were subtle in the TPH2KO mice; they were enhanced in the DKO mice. Herein, we confirm findings from prior descriptions of TPH1 knockout mice and present the first reported phenotypic evaluations of Tph2 and Tph1/Tph2 knockout mice. The behavioral effects observed in the TPH2 KO and DKO mice strongly confirm the role of 5-HT and its synthetic enzymes in the etiology and treatment of affective disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2171656061,"Newly synthesized proteins are translocated across the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum membrane or the prokaryotic plasma membrane through an evolutionarily conserved protein conducting channel or translocon known as Sec61 in eukaryotes and SecY in prokaryotes. In bacteria, the SecA ATPase is thought to be the motor for translocation through the SecY channel. Two papers by Tom Rapoport and colleagues report the long-awaited structure of the SecA–SecY complex from bacteria. The structure, reveals major conformational changes between both partners and suggests that SecA uses a two-helix finger to push translocating proteins into SecY's cytoplasmic funnel. Crosslinking studies provide further experimental support for this mechanism. In a third paper, Osamu Nureki and colleagues present a crystal structure of SecY bound to an anti-SecY Fab fragment revealing a pre-open state of the channel. Together these three papers provide novel insights into the path taken by a translocating protein. In News and Views, Anastassios Economou takes stock of where this work leaves current knowledge of this 'astonishing cellular nanomachine'. A crystal structure of SecY bound to an anti SecY Fab fragment revealing a pre-open state of the channel is presented. Over 30% of proteins are secreted across or integrated into membranes. Their newly synthesized forms contain either cleavable signal sequences or non-cleavable membrane anchor sequences, which direct them to the evolutionarily conserved Sec translocon (SecYEG in prokaryotes and Sec61, comprising α-, γ- and β-subunits, in eukaryotes). The translocon then functions as a protein-conducting channel1. These processes of protein localization occur either at or after translation. In bacteria, the SecA ATPase2,3 drives post-translational translocation. The only high-resolution structure of a translocon available so far is that for SecYEβ from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii4, which lacks SecA. Here we present the 3.2-Å-resolution crystal structure of the SecYE translocon from a SecA-containing organism, Thermus thermophilus. The structure, solved as a complex with an anti-SecY Fab fragment, revealed a ‘pre-open’ state of SecYE, in which several transmembrane helices are shifted, as compared to the previous SecYEβ structure4, to create a hydrophobic crack open to the cytoplasm. Fab and SecA bind to a common site at the tip of the cytoplasmic domain of SecY. Molecular dynamics and disulphide mapping analyses suggest that the pre-open state might represent a SecYE conformational transition that is inducible by SecA binding. Moreover, we identified a SecA–SecYE interface that comprises SecA residues originally buried inside the protein, indicating that both the channel and the motor components of the Sec machinery undergo cooperative conformational changes on formation of the functional complex."
https://openalex.org/W2022726657,"Most amino acids are encoded by more than one codon. These synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency: in every organism, some codons are used more commonly, while others are more rare. Though the encoded protein sequence is identical, selective pressures favor more common codons for enhanced translation speed and fidelity. However, rare codons persist, presumably due to neutral drift. Here, we determine whether other, unknown factors, beyond neutral drift, affect the selection and/or distribution of rare codons. We have developed a novel algorithm that evaluates the relative rareness of a nucleotide sequence used to produce a given protein sequence. We show that rare codons, rather than being randomly scattered across genes, often occur in large clusters. These clusters occur in numerous eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and are not confined to unusual or rarely expressed genes: many highly expressed genes, including genes for ribosomal proteins, contain rare codon clusters. A rare codon cluster can impede ribosome translation of the rare codon sequence. These results indicate additional selective pressures govern the use of synonymous codons, and specifically that local pauses in translation can be beneficial for protein biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1982241930,"Keeping track of time is essential to many aspects of perception and cognition. Several neuronal circuits have been shown to process temporal information on very short time scales only — microseconds to milliseconds. Now Sumbré et al. report that neuronal activity in the zebrafish visual system can keep the beat of relatively slow light flashes, at regular intervals of a few seconds, for up to 20 seconds after the stimulus is removed. This type of rhythmic activity on such long time scales may be the basis for an adjustable neural 'metronome', serving as a mechanism for the short-term perceptual memory of rhythmic sensory experiences. The ability to process temporal information is fundamental to sensory perception, cognitive processing and motor behaviour of all living organisms, from amoebae to humans1,2,3,4. Neural circuit mechanisms based on neuronal and synaptic properties have been shown to process temporal information over the range of tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds5,6,7. How neural circuits process temporal information in the range of seconds to minutes is much less understood. Studies of working memory in monkeys and rats have shown that neurons in the prefrontal cortex8,9,10, the parietal cortex9,11 and the thalamus12 exhibit ramping activities that linearly correlate with the lapse of time until the end of a specific time interval of several seconds that the animal is trained to memorize. Many organisms can also memorize the time interval of rhythmic sensory stimuli in the timescale of seconds and can coordinate motor behaviour accordingly, for example, by keeping the rhythm after exposure to the beat of music. Here we report a form of rhythmic activity among specific neuronal ensembles in the zebrafish optic tectum, which retains the memory of the time interval (in the order of seconds) of repetitive sensory stimuli for a duration of up to ∼20 s. After repetitive visual conditioning stimulation (CS) of zebrafish larvae, we observed rhythmic post-CS activities among specific tectal neuronal ensembles, with a regular interval that closely matched the CS. Visuomotor behaviour of the zebrafish larvae also showed regular post-CS repetitions at the entrained time interval that correlated with rhythmic neuronal ensemble activities in the tectum. Thus, rhythmic activities among specific neuronal ensembles may act as an adjustable ‘metronome’ for time intervals in the order of seconds, and serve as a mechanism for the short-term perceptual memory of rhythmic sensory experience."
https://openalex.org/W2007432423,"An important step in the biosynthesis of many proteins is their partial or complete translocation across the plasma membrane in prokaryotes or the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes. In bacteria, secretory proteins are generally translocated after completion of their synthesis by the interaction of the cytoplasmic ATPase SecA and a protein-conducting channel formed by the SecY complex. How SecA moves substrates through the SecY channel is unclear. However, a recent structure of a SecA-SecY complex raises the possibility that the polypeptide chain is moved by a two-helix finger domain of SecA that is inserted into the cytoplasmic opening of the SecY channel. Here we have used disulphide-bridge crosslinking to show that the loop at the tip of the two-helix finger of Escherichia coli SecA interacts with a polypeptide chain right at the entrance into the SecY pore. Mutagenesis demonstrates that a tyrosine in the loop is particularly important for translocation, but can be replaced by some other bulky, hydrophobic residues. We propose that the two-helix finger of SecA moves a polypeptide chain into the SecY channel with the tyrosine providing the major contact with the substrate, a mechanism analogous to that suggested for hexameric, protein-translocating ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2153676801,"Background Recent data suggests that in chronic pain there are changes in gray matter consistent with decreased brain volume, indicating that the disease process may produce morphological changes in the brains of those affected. However, no study has evaluated cortical thickness in relation to specific functional changes in evoked pain. In this study we sought to investigate structural (gray matter thickness) and functional (blood oxygenation dependent level – BOLD) changes in cortical regions of precisely matched patients with chronic trigeminal neuropathic pain (TNP) affecting the right maxillary (V2) division of the trigeminal nerve. The model has a number of advantages including the evaluation of specific changes that can be mapped to known somatotopic anatomy. Methodology/Principal Findings Cortical regions were chosen based on sensory (Somatosensory cortex (SI and SII), motor (MI) and posterior insula), or emotional (DLPFC, Frontal, Anterior Insula, Cingulate) processing of pain. Both structural and functional (to brush-induced allodynia) scans were obtained and averaged from two different imaging sessions separated by 2–6 months in all patients. Age and gender-matched healthy controls were also scanned twice for cortical thickness measurement. Changes in cortical thickness of TNP patients were frequently colocalized and correlated with functional allodynic activations, and included both cortical thickening and thinning in sensorimotor regions, and predominantly thinning in emotional regions. Conclusions Overall, such patterns of cortical thickness suggest a dynamic functionally-driven plasticity of the brain. These structural changes, which correlated with the pain duration, age-at-onset, pain intensity and cortical activity, may be specific targets for evaluating therapeutic interventions."

Finally, RNA-DNA hybrids are more readily displaced by Pol ; than DNA hybrids, thereby favoring degradation of initiator RNA during Okazaki maturation. The process of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells leads to the generation of a vast number of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Approximately 50,000,000 Okazaki fragments are synthesized when a human cell replicates, and all of these need to be efficiently and accurately matured into continuous lagging strands to ensure genome integrity. Various DNA structures are generated during the synthesis and maturation of Okazaki fragments. These structures constitute the largest pool for potential DNA damage in the cell. Incomplete or poorly processed Okazaki fragments can lead to repeat expansion mutations, small duplication mutations, and to the generation of double-stranded DNA breaks (1Gordenin D.A. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 116-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). A large number of activities have been implicated in lagging strand DNA maturation. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD27 gene product is the 5′-flap endonuclease FEN1. FEN1RAD27 has been assigned a dominant role in creating ligatable nicks during Okazaki maturation (reviewed in Refs. 2Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev.

This unusual class of duplication mutations was proposed to result through ligation of an unremoved flap with the 3′-end of the downstream Okazaki fragment. This type of duplications is caused not only by the lack of RAD27 but also by a subtle rad27-p defect that severely decreases FEN1RAD27 binding to the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in vitro (5Jin Y.H.

Consistent with these genetic observations, biochemical studies showed that FEN1RAD27 is ideally suited to create ligatable nicks from 5′-flaps generated by the lagging strand DNA polymerase ; (6Maga G.

Based on these biochemical and genetic insights, we and others previously proposed that FEN1RAD27 is part of a minimal core Okazaki maturation machinery that efficiently processes the vast majority of the Okazaki fragments in the cell and can be assisted by a number of auxiliary factors that function under specific circumstances when the core machinery falters (Fig. 1) (reviewed in Ref. 8Garg P. Burgers P. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2005; 40: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The core maturation machinery consists of three factors: Pol ;, FEN1RAD27 and DNA ligase I. These three factors are held in a complex through interactions with PCNA. FEN1RAD27 and DNA ligase I are both single-subunit enzymes with well characterized biochemical activities (reviewed in Refs. 2Liu Y. Kao H.I. Bambara R.A. Annu. Rev.

Garg P. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1907-1915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 17Huang M.E. Le Douarin B. Henry C. Galibert F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 260: 541-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We previously noted that defects in the 3′-5′-exonuclease activity of Pol ; can be lethal when combined with rad27Δ or even with minor defects in RAD27 (5Jin Y.H. Obert R. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The same combined lethality was observed for POL3 mutants that, although fully proficient for exonuclease activity, show impaired switching from the polymerase to the exonuclease domain (18Jin Y.H. Garg P. Stith C.M. Al Refai H. Sterling J. Weston L. Kunkel T. Resnick M.A. Burgers P.M. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Importantly, double mutant combinations that are not lethal show an increased rate of small duplication mutations, a hallmark signature of defects in lagging strand DNA replication. This led us to propose that strand displacement synthesis by the polymerase (Pol) activity of Pol ; is countered by the competing 3′-5′-exonuclease (Exo) activity of the enzyme, also contained within the catalytic Pol3 subunit of polymerase ;. In agreement with this proposal, our in vitro studies showed that the functional interaction between the three enzymatic activities (i.e. polymerase and 3′-exonuclease activities of Pol ; and the 5′-flap endonuclease activity of FEN1) are important for efficient maturation of Okazaki fragments (19Jin Y.H. Ayyagari R. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1626-1633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). When Pol ; reaches the 5′-end of the downstream Okazaki fragment, it continues an additional 1–2-nt synthesis in a strand displacement mode (20Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). FEN1 removes the small 5′-flap and creates a ligatable nick for DNA ligase on the border between adjacent fragments, provided that no RNA is left on the downstream Okazaki fragment. Otherwise, the RNA primer is removed by iterative processing through alternate Pol ; and FEN1 action, called nick translation, where a single ribonucleotide is typically removed with each cycle (Fig. 1). This forward movement by Pol ; can be counteracted by its Exo activity. The nuclease activity of Pol ; is generally considered to be a proofreading function to assure high fidelity DNA replication (21Simon M. Giot L. Faye G. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, the nuclease activity also plays a crucial role in Okazaki fragment maturation (18Jin Y.H. Garg P. Stith C.M. Al Refai H. Sterling J. Weston L. Kunkel T. Resnick M.A. Burgers P.M. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Exo-mediated 3′-degradation increases opportunities for generating and maintaining ligatable nicks. In fact, Pol ; has the remarkable ability to idle at a nick. Idling is the iterative process of limited (∼1–2-nt) strand displacement synthesis at the nick, followed by switching to the Exo domain and degradation of the displacing strand until the nick position has been reached again. In this fashion, Pol ; not only has the ability to resolve small 5′-flaps by degradation of the displacing 3′-strand (Fig. 1) but also maintains a dynamic relationship with the nick position. This idling capacity at a nick is unique to the lagging strand Pol ;, and it is not displayed by leading strand Pol ? (20Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). This efficient minimal core machinery consisting of Pol ; and FEN1 can be augmented by several auxiliary proteins in order to mature Okazaki fragments that might be difficult to process because of DNA structural problems or if there is an accumulation of long flaps because of lack of flap cutting by FEN1. Among these is Dna2, which has both 3′-5′-helicase and nuclease activity. Its nuclease activity is essential for viability (22Lee K.H. Kim D.W. Bae S.H. Kim J.A. Ryu G.H. Kwon Y.N. Kim K.A. Koo H.S. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 2873-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 23Budd M.E. Choe W. Campbell J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16518-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Pif1 is a 5′-3′-helicase that functions in mitochondrial DNA maintenance and in telomere homeostasis (24Boule J.B. Zakian V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4147-4153Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It was also suggested to counteract formation of ligatable nicks by creating larger flaps. This conclusion was drawn because deletion of PIF1 rescues the lethality of dna2 mutants (25Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical studies have shown that the presence of Pif1 during gap filling by Pol ; favors the generation of longer flaps, thereby providing a biochemical rationale for an essential Dna2 requirement in cells carrying Pif1 (26Rossi M.L. Pike J.E. Wang W. Burgers P.M. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 27483-27493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Other factors that may act during lagging strand replication include the flap exoendonuclease Exo1, RNase H2, and the RecQ-like helicase Sgs1 (27Chen J.Z. Qiu J. Shen B. Holmquist G.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Tran P.T. Erdeniz N. Dudley S. Liskay R.M. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 895-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Ii M. Brill S.J. Curr. Genet. 2005; 48: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither exo1Δ nor rnh2Δ (eliminating RNase H2) mutants cause small duplications. It is not clear under what conditions these auxiliary Okazaki maturation factors are called into action. One prevailing model is that when flaps have grown to excessive length, they are no longer substrates for FEN1; nor can they be restored to a nick structure by the Exo activity of Pol ;. Long 5′-flaps, perhaps longer than 25 nt, to which DNA-binding proteins are bound (e.g. the single-stranded binding protein RPA) fail to engage FEN1 (reviewed in Ref. 30Kao H.I. Veeraraghavan J. Polaczek P. Campbell J.L. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15014-15024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), whereas backup by the Exo activity of Pol ; is also limited to flaps that are only a few nt long (20Garg P. Stith C.M. Sabouri N. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2764-2773Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Apparently, efficient and faithful Okazaki fragment maturation requires a proper balance between DNA synthesis, strand displacement synthesis, and the capability for 5′- and 3′-degradation, as indicated in the model in Fig. 1. One prediction of the model is that under conditions where strand displacement synthesis is reduced, there would be less of a need for nuclease degradation of long flaps. Genetic experiments with mutants of the auxiliary Okazaki maturation nuclease DNA2 supported this view in that the temperature sensitivity of conditional dna2 mutants could be suppressed by deletion of the POL32 gene (25Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the suppressive effect of the POL32-null mutation was caused by a reduction in strand displacement synthesis by the two-subunit form of Pol ;, resulting in the creation of a smaller number of the infrequent substrates that would require Dna2 for processing. Although consistent with the data, this hypothesis lacked experimental verification. We have undertaken comprehensive genetic and biochemical studies to understand the role that Pol32 plays in the core machinery required for Okazaki maturation. We found that the distribution of flap sizes is determined by several competing activities in vitro. The length of the flap generated during a processive cycle of strand displacement synthesis by Pol ; is one indicator of the length of the flap to be cut by FEN1. A second indicator is the capacity for 3′-degradation by the Exo activity of Pol ;. Third, the presence of FEN1 curtails processive strand invasion synthesis by Pol ; in favor of flap cutting. Finally, in keeping with its function in Okazaki fragment maturation, Pol ; shows an increased capacity to displace RNA-DNA hybrids. If Pol ; lacks Pol32 (designated Pol ;*), there is decreased processivity of strand displacement as well as reduced 3′-degradation. As a consequence, the size distribution of short flaps (<10 nt) is not affected by Pol32. However, long flaps are only detected when Pol32 is present. These in vitro findings in parallel with our genetic studies provide a compelling explanation of how cells deal with the balance between flap generation and cutting. Importantly, the combination of the exonuclease activity of Pol ; and its third subunit Pol32 provide flexibility to the eukaryotic Okazaki maturation machinery. Yeast Strains—All strains were derived from ALE100, ALE101, ALE1000, and ALE1001, isogenic to CG379 (MAT; ade5-1 his 7-2 leu 2-3, 112trp1-289 ura3Δ). In addition, strains carried alleles of LYS2 in two chromosomal locations (see Ref. 5Jin Y.H. Obert R. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Resnick M.A. Gordenin D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5122-5127Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar and references therein). Completely homozygous isogenic diploid strains were obtained after transformation of the haploid wild type strain with a YEpHO-URA3 plasmid carrying the URA3 selectable marker and HO-endonuclease gene under control of its own promoter. HO-endonuclease causes mating type switching within the population of transformed cells that allows mating and diploid formation. Single colony isolates of diploids that had lost the HO plasmid were taken. Isogenic diploids homozygous for pol3-L523H/pol3-L523H were created by crossing two isogenic isolates of MATa pol3-L523H and MAT; pol3-L523H. Diploids with single and multiple heterozygosities for deletion alleles were obtained by transforming homozygous wild type diploids with deletion cassettes carrying selectable markers. The RAD27 gene was replaced with the RAD27: URA3-Blast cassette (31Sommers C.H. Miller E.J. Dujon B. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4193-4196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Other deletions were obtained by inserting antibiotic-resistant cassettes (32Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1389) Google Scholar). Multiple deletions within the same heterozygous diploid strain were introduced separately by successive transformations. Isogenic diploid strains carrying the triple heterozygous mutations POL3/pol3-5DV RAD27/rad27Δ POL32/pol32Δ were obtained by crossing isogenic isolates of the MAT; pol3-5DV (note that pol3-5DV was also referred as pol3-D520V in Ref. 18Jin Y.H. Garg P. Stith C.M. Al Refai H. Sterling J. Weston L. Kunkel T. Resnick M.A. Burgers P.M. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with isogenic isolates of the MATa rad27Δ pol32Δ genotype. All crosses and sporulations were carried out at least in duplicate with independent isolates of the relevant strains. Tetrad Analysis—Effects of eliminating Pol32 or Pif1 on the viability of single and multiple mutants presumably defective in Okazaki maturation were studied in the immediate meiotic progeny of heterozygous diploids. This allowed us to minimize effects due to the accumulation of suppressor mutations that could be selected if multiple mutants were obtained by consecutive transformations of a haploid strain in order to disrupt the genes of interest. Asci of double or triple heterozygous diploids were dissected on YPDA plates and incubated at 23 or 30 °C. In order to allow spores carrying slow growing genotypes to form colonies, plates containing very small colonies were incubated up to 7–10 days. Colonies were then replica-plated onto both YPDA and diagnostic media to identify mating type and gene deletions by the presence of markers. YPDA plates were incubated at 23, 30, and 37 °C to identify possible temperature sensitivities of single and multiple mutants. The presence of the pol3-5DV mutation was determined by diagnostic restriction digestion of a PCR product. We explored genetic interactions throughout this paper in the progeny of multiple heterozygous diploids, where all possible combinations of mutant alleles are represented by colonies that grew from a fresh meiotic progeny. Replication Proteins—Overexpression and purification of Pol ; and Pol ;-DV (DNA polymerase ; with pol3-5DV mutation) from yeast has been described in detail (33Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In order to overproduce Pol ;* and Pol ;-DV*, the overexpression strain contained plasmids pBL335 (GAL-GST-POL3) or pBL335-DV (GAL-GST-pol3-D520V), respectively, together with plasmid pBL338 (GAL-POL31 (16Burgers P.M. Gerik K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19756-19762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar)). After growth, galactose induction, cell lysis, and glutathione affinity chromatography, the preparation was subjected to 3C-protease treatment to remove the glutathione S-transferase purification tag, followed by MonoS chromatography, as described for Pol ; (33Fortune J.M. Stith C.M. Kissling G.E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 4335-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Replication protein A (RPA), PCNA, Replication factor C (RFC), and FEN1 were purified from Escherichia coli overproduction strains (7Ayyagari R. Gomes X.V. Gordenin D.A. Burgers P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1618-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 34Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14541-14549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All other enzymes were obtained commercially. DNA Substrates—All oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies and purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis or high pressure liquid chromatography before use. They are as follows: Bio-V6, 3′-biotin-T31CCCTTCCCTCTCCCTCCTCTTCTTCCCTCT25CCAAGGTGGTTTGTTTTGGTTGGGTTGA-biotin-5′; C12, 5′-AGGGAAGGGAGAGGGAGGAGAAGAAGGGAG; C6, 5′-GGTTCCACCAAACAAAACCAACCCAAC; RC6, 5′-GGUUCCACCAAACAAAACCAACCCAAC (ribonucleotides underlined). The 113-nt 5′ and 3′ biotinylated template Bio-V6 was prepared by hybridizing two half-oligonucleotides to a bridging primer followed by ligation with T4 DNA ligase and purification by preparative urea-PAGE (see Fig. 3A). For strand displacement assays, the primer oligonucleotide C12 was 5′-32P-labeled, and 5 pmol of 32P-C12 was hybridized to 7.5 pmol of Bio-V6 and 15 pmol of pC6 or pRC6 (made by phosphorylation of C6 and RC6 with cold ATP). The oligonucleotides were hybridized to the template at 70 °C. For nick translation assays, either primer C6 or RC6 was 5′-32P-labeled, and 5 pmol of the labeled oligonucleotide was hybridized to 7.5 pmol of Bio-V6 together with 15 pmol of C12. For idling assays, 5 pmol of Bio-V6 was hybridized with 7.5 pmol of C12 and 7.5 pmol of pC6. After hybridization, streptavidin was added in a 2-fold molar excess to all template-primer substrates. Strand Displacement and Nick Translation Assays—In all assays in this study, the DNA concentration was 7 nm. Standard 20-;l assays contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 ;g/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm MgAc2, 0.5 mm ATP, 110 mm NaCl, 100 ;m each dNTP, 140 fmol of DNA substrate (see above and in the figures), 1 pmol of RPA, 200 fmol of RFC, and 400 fmol of PCNA. The DNA was preincubated with RPA, PCNA, and RFC for 1 min at 30 °C, and the reaction was started by adding the relevant DNA polymerase at the indicated concentrations. Added NaCl was adjusted such that the final concentration, including additions from enzyme storage buffers, was 110 mm. In nick translation assays, FEN1 (200 fmol) was added together with the indicated polymerase. Aliquots were quenched in 20 mm EDTA, 0.4% SDS (final) and heated at 50 °C for 15 min. After the addition of 95% formamide to a 60% final concentration, the samples were heated at 95 °C for 2 min and analyzed on a 12% (strand displacement) or 20% (nick translation) denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImager analysis. In order to allow accurate quantitation of weak signals, the gels were exposed for several hours and for 2 days. PhosphorImager file intensities were correlated by quantitation of intermediate signals that were in the linear response range for both exposures. Quantification was carried out using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). The images in the figures were contrast-enhanced for visualization purposes. Idling Assays—The above assay was scaled up to 50 ;l. It contained unlabeled DNA, 10 ;m [;-32P]dGTP, and a 100 ;m concentration of the other dNTPs and reaction conditions and enzymes as indicated above and in the legend to Fig. 4. Aliquots of 10 ;l were taken after various times, from 1 to 7 min, quenched by the addition of 5 ;l of stop buffer (25 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and a 5 mm concentration each of the relevant nonradioactive dNTP and dNMP). Reaction products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine/cellulose in 0.5 m LiCl/HCOOH, followed by PhosphorImager analysis. Idling rates were calculated from the linear slopes of time courses. Previous genetic studies have established several networks of interactive factors involved in Okazaki fragment maturation. One network links the nuclease activities of FEN1RAD27 and Dna2, showing that these factors have compensatory activities. Overexpression of DNA2 suppresses the temperature sensitivity of rad27Δ, and overexpression of RAD27 suppresses the temperature sensitivity of a dna2-1 mutant (36Budd M.E. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2136-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A second network links Dna2 with the helicase Pif1 and the Pol32 subunit of Pol ;. Pif1Δ suppresses the lethality of the dna2Δ mutant, and the additional deletion of POL32 improves growth in the triple mutant (25Budd M.E. Reis C.C. Smith S. Myung K. Campbell J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2490-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). A third genetic network includes the core activities for Okazaki maturation. It centers around the nuclease activities of Pol ; and FEN1RAD27, revealing a synthetic lethality or showing a signature hypermutability of small duplications when even mild mutations in POL3 and RAD27 are combined (18Jin Y.H. Garg P. Stith C.M. Al Refai H. Sterling J. Weston L. Kunkel T. Resnick M.A. Burgers P.M. Gordenin D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 461-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In order to gain additional insights into this core network, we have made a series of multiple mutants that probe the interactions and interdependencies of these networks. We analyzed a large number of spores in the progeny of multiple heterozygous diploids to identify all possible viable single and multiple mutant genotypes based on their associated selection markers or by PCR/restriction digest genotyping. This approach reduces the propagation of potentially unstable mutants to a practically achievable minimum and therefore limits the possibility of generating suppressor mutations of poorly growing mutants. This important technical imposition allowed us to draw conclusions about genetic interactions that are not affected by the generation of suppressor mutants during prolonged growth. We based our experimental design on the use of two genetic defects (pol32Δ and pif1Δ) that may lead to reduced flap formation via different mechanisms. Pol"
https://openalex.org/W2159820287,"Service providers may vary service quality depending on whether they work alone or provide the service simultaneously with a partner. The latter case resembles a prisoner's dilemma, in which one provider may try to reap the benefits of the interaction without providing the service. Here we present a game-theory model based on the marginal value theorem, which predicts that as long as the client determines the duration, and the providers cooperate towards mutual gain, service quality will increase in the pair situation. This prediction is consistent with field observations and with an experiment on cleaning mutualism, in which stable male-female pairs of the cleaner wrasse Labroides dimidiatus repeatedly inspect client fish jointly. Cleaners cooperate by eating ectoparasites off clients but actually prefer to cheat and eat client mucus. Because clients often leave in response to such cheating, the benefits of cheating can be gained by only one cleaner during a pair inspection. In both data sets, the increased service quality during pair inspection was mainly due to the smaller females behaving significantly more cooperatively than their larger male partners. In contrast, during solitary inspections, cleaning behaviour was very similar between the sexes. Our study highlights the importance of incorporating interactions between service providers to make more quantitative predictions about cooperation between species."
https://openalex.org/W2043676276,"Kuntiz-type toxins (KTTs) have been found in the venom of animals such as snake, cone snail and sea anemone. The main ancestral function of Kunitz-type proteins was the inhibition of a diverse array of serine proteases, while toxic activities (such as ion-channel blocking) were developed under a variety of Darwinian selection pressures. How new functions were grafted onto an old protein scaffold and what effect Darwinian selection pressures had on KTT evolution remains a puzzle.Here we report the presence of a new superfamily of ktts in spiders (TARANTULAS: Ornithoctonus huwena and Ornithoctonus hainana), which share low sequence similarity to known KTTs and is clustered in a distinct clade in the phylogenetic tree of KTT evolution. The representative molecule of spider KTTs, HWTX-XI, purified from the venom of O. huwena, is a bi-functional protein which is a very potent trypsin inhibitor (about 30-fold more strong than BPTI) as well as a weak Kv1.1 potassium channel blocker. Structural analysis of HWTX-XI in 3-D by NMR together with comparative function analysis of 18 expressed mutants of this toxin revealed two separate sites, corresponding to these two activities, located on the two ends of the cone-shape molecule of HWTX-XI. Comparison of non-synonymous/synonymous mutation ratios (omega) for each site in spider and snake KTTs, as well as PBTI like body Kunitz proteins revealed high Darwinian selection pressure on the binding sites for Kv channels and serine proteases in snake, while only on the proteases in spider and none detected in body proteins, suggesting different rates and patterns of evolution among them. The results also revealed a series of key events in the history of spider KTT evolution, including the formation of a novel KTT family (named sub-Kuntiz-type toxins) derived from the ancestral native KTTs with the loss of the second disulfide bridge accompanied by several dramatic sequence modifications.These finding illustrate that the two activity sites of Kunitz-type toxins are functionally and evolutionally independent and provide new insights into effects of Darwinian selection pressures on KTT evolution, and mechanisms by which new functions can be grafted onto old protein scaffolds."

It has long been hoped that identifying alleles that confer increased risk of such disorders would provide clues for neurobiological investigation.

https://openalex.org/W2113243225,"The clinical application of IFN-gamma release assays (IGRAs) has recently improved the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection. In a multicenter study of the Tuberculosis Network European Trialsgroup (TBNET) we aimed to ascertain in routine clinical practice the accuracy of a novel assay using selected peptides encoded in the mycobacterial genomic region of difference (RD) 1 for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis in comparison with tuberculin skin test (TST), QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube (Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, Australia) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxfordimmunotec, Abingdon, UK).425 individuals from 6 different European centres were prospectively enrolled. We found that sensitivity of the novel test, TST, QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB was respectively 73.1%, 85.3%, 78.1%, and 85.2%; specificity was respectively 70.6%, 48.0%, 61.9% and 44.3%; positive likelihood ratios were respectively 2.48, 1.64, 2.05, and 1.53; negative likelihood ratios were respectively 0.38, 0.31, 0.35, 0.33. Sensitivity of TST combined with the novel test, QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB increased up to 92.4%, 97.7% and 97.1%, respectively. The likelihood ratios of combined negative results of TST with, respectively, the novel test, QuantiFERON-TB GOLD In-Tube and T-SPOT.TB were 0.19, 0.07 and 0.10.The assay based on RD1 selected peptides has similar accuracy for active tuberculosis compared with TST and commercial IGRAs. Then, independently of the spectrum of antigens used in the assays to elicit mycobacterial specific immune responses, the novel test, IGRAs, and the TST do not allow an accurate identification of active tuberculosis in clinical practice. However, the combined use of the novel assay or commercial IGRAs with TST may allow exclusion of tuberculosis."
https://openalex.org/W2093824766,"Huntingtin has been reported to regulate the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional repressor RE1-silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF). The REST/NRSF-interacting LIM domain protein (RILP) has also been shown to regulate REST/NRSF nuclear translocation. Therefore, we were prompted to address the question of how two distinct proteins could have the same function. We initially used a yeast two-hybrid screen to look for an interaction between huntingtin and RILP. This screen identified dynactin p150Glued as an interacting protein. Coimmunoprecipitation of proteins in vitro expressed in a reticulocyte lysate system showed an interaction between REST/NRSF and RILP as well as between RILP and dynactin p150Glued. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis further showed a complex containing RILP, dynactin p150Glued, and huntingtin. Huntingtin did not interact directly with either REST/NRSF or RILP, but did interact with dynactin p150Glued. The N-terminal fragment of wild-type huntingtin did not affect the interaction between dynactin p150Glued and RILP; however, mutant huntingtin weakened this interaction. We further show that HAP1 (huntingtin-associated protein-1) prevents this complex from translocating REST/NRSF to the nucleus. Thus, this study suggests that REST/NRSF, dynactin p150Glued, huntingtin, HAP1, and RILP form a complex involved in the translocation of REST/NRSF into the nucleus and that HAP1 controls REST/NRSF cellular localization in neurons.

Thus, this study suggests that REST/NRSF, dynactin p150Glued, huntingtin, HAP1, and RILP form a complex involved in the translocation of REST/NRSF into the nucleus and that HAP1 controls REST/NRSF cellular localization in neurons.

There are >1000 genes containing RE1/NRSE and even more when one considers functional RE1/NRSE-like elements. These include genes that encode proteins with fundamental importance for neuronal function, including signaling proteins, adhesion molecules, synaptic vesicle proteins, neuronal receptors, and neurotransmitter synthetic enzymes (14.Shimojo M.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9025-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This protein, the REST/NRSF-interacting LIM domain protein (RILP), is predominantly a nuclear protein that is required for the translocation of REST/NRSF into the nucleus. It thus seemed surprising that two distinct proteins, huntingtin and RILP, would have the same function and act independently. In the present study, we identify dynactin p150Glued as an interacting protein of both RILP and huntingtin and demonstrate formation of a complex between these proteins that, in neurons, additionally contains HAP1. This study provides new insights into the role of RILP, huntingtin, dynactin p150Glued, and HAP1 in the regulation of neuron-specific gene expression by REST/NRSF. Yeast Two-hybrid System—A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted with the MATCHMAKER Yeast Two-hybrid System 3 (Clontech) using a C-terminal fragment (amino acids 391–831) of human RILP as bait. A DNA fragment encoding amino acids 391–831 of human RILP was amplified from its cDNA using PfuTurbo Hotstart DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and primers TCACCCAACTAGATCACACTCTGAGTGAGTACGCATGTG and CCCATCCGCTGTGACCGCTGT. This fragment was first inserted into the SmaI site in pBluescript and then inserted in-frame into the bait vector pGBKT7. A human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library constructed in the pGAD10 vector (Clontech) was used for screening. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Positive clones were identified by nutritional selection (synthetic defined medium/-His/-Leu/-Trp) and α-galactosidase staining as specified by the manufacturer. Plasmid Construction—HAP1 and dynactin p150Glued cDNAs were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HAP1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and subcloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was digested with EcoRI/XbaI and cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). The cDNAs of wild-type (containing 15 polyQs) and mutant (containing 138 polyQs) huntingtin proteins in pHM830 was obtained from Dr. R. Truant (McMaster University). These plasmids were digested with XhoI/NotI, and the fragments were inserted into pcDNA3.1. The sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Pulldown Assay of RILP and Dynactin p150Glued—A full-length RILP cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3.1-His, which contains an N-terminal His tag (Invitrogen). A full-length cDNA of dynactin p150Glued (American Type Culture Collection) was cloned into the expression vector pCMVTag2 (Stratagene). The sequences of both constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. FLAG-tagged dynactin p150Glued and/or His-tagged RILP was expressed in the TnT coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein expression system (Promega) using the manufacturer's protocol. Lysates were applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column using 20 mm phosphate buffer, followed by washing with this buffer. The absorbed proteins were eluted with 200 mm imidazole in the phosphate buffer. Coimmunoprecipitation Analysis—Lysates from HeLa and NT2 cells were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and 1.0% Nonidet P-40). NT2 cells were incubated in medium containing 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (Sigma) to induce a neuronal phenotype. Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-RILP, anti-dynactin p150Glued, anti-huntingtin, anti-HAP1, or nonimmune antibodies. All antibodies except anti-RILP (16.Shimojo M. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9025-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with anti-RILP, anti-dynactin p150Glued, anti-HAP1, or nonimmune antibodies. Lysates from each cell line were incubated with each antibody at 4 °C. After 20 h, protein A/G was added, incubated for 1 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample loading buffer. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis with each antibody, and visualized with the Odyssey fluorescence-based detection system (LI-COR Biosciences). Cell Culture—HeLa and NT2 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Mouse striatal cell lines expressing wild-type or mutant huntingtin were kindly provided by Dr. M. MacDonald (Massachusetts General Hospital). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 10,000 units/ml penicillin, and 10,000 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C (HeLa and NT2 cells) or at 33 °C (mouse striatal cell lines) in 5% CO2. To induce a neuronal phenotype, NT2 cells were treated with 10 μm all-trans-retinoic acid in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 weeks. The medium was changed every 2–3 days. Construction and Transfection of Small Interfering RNA—Double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) was purchased from Ambion. The oligonucleotide sequence of HAP1 siRNA (17.Sheng G. Chang G.Q. Lin J.Y. Yu Z.X. Fang Z.H. Rong J. Lipton S.A. Li S.H. Tong G. Leibowitz S.F. Li X.J. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 526-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) is 5′-GAAGTATGTCCTCCAGCAA-3′. The following scrambled random oligonucleotide were used as a negative control: 5′-GCGCGCTTTGTAGGATTCG-3′. Transfection was performed using the Silencer™ siRNA transfection kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reporter Gene Analysis—The EcoRI/XhoI fragment of the human cholinergic gene locus was inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pXP2 vector. pXP2-EX is a construct containing a 2200-bp 5′-extension of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter gene. After transfection of these constructs as well as the pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid into cells using Effectene reagent (Qiagen), cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured by a luminescence assay (18.Shimojo M. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1130-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity was measured using the Galacto-Light system (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Luminescence was detected using an Opticomp I luminometer (GEM Biomedical, Inc.). Intracellular Localization of RILP—HeLa and NT2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection, cells were plated on glass coverslips (22 × 22 mm) in 6-well plates and transfected the next day. The transfected cells were grown for 24 h, fixed in dry ice/methanol for 2 min, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)-T-M (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% skim milk). Fixed cells were incubated with antibodies (anti-NRSF antibody (12C11-1) at 1:50 dilution and anti-HAP1 antibody at 1:50 dilution) in TBS-T-M at 25 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed three times with TBS-T-M, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594- or Alexa Fluor 488-linked IgG (Molecular Probes) in TBS-T-M. Coverslips were mounted in VECTASHIELD H-1200 (Vector Laboratories), which contains 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for staining nuclei. Fluorescence was observed using a Nikon E600 epifluorescent microscope. Images were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Quantification was performed using Leica LCS software from three line scan intensity measurements through each cell. The average intensity of nuclear or cytosolic REST in each scan was used to calculate the fraction of REST in the nucleus relative to REST in the cytosol. The values of the averaged cell measurements are reported as means ± S.D. (n = 12). To elucidate the function of RILP and its relationship to huntingtin, we screened for interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. A C-terminal RILP fragment (amino acids 391–831) was used as bait to screen a human brain MATCHMAKER cDNA library. As noted previously, the N terminus of RILP contains LIM domains, which are REST/NRSF-interacting domains, whereas the C-terminal domain is important for nuclear localization of RILP and REST/NRSF (16.Shimojo M. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9025-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18.Shimojo M. Hersh L.B. J. Neurochem. 2006; 96: 1130-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This yeast two-hybrid screen yielded a single partial clone of dynactin p150Glued. To further study the interaction between dynactin p150Glued and RILP, a full-length cDNA of human dynactin p150Glued was cloned into pCMVTag2, in which a FLAG epitope tag was added to the N terminus. The cDNA for RILP was cloned into pcDNA3.1-His, in which an N-terminal His tag was added. His-RILP and FLAG-dynactin p150Glued were then coexpressed in vitro using the TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system. An aliquot of the lysate was applied to Ni-NTA-agarose, washed, and eluted with 200 mm imidazole, with the fractions subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG or anti-His antibodies. As a result, both RILP and dynactin p150Glued bound to Ni-NTA-agarose and were found in eluates (Fig. 1, E lanes), suggesting that they directly interact. Because the above data show that RILP interacts with dynactin p150Glued, we further analyzed the physiological interaction of endogenous RILP, dynactin p150Glued, and huntingtin. Lysates from HeLa cells were prepared and incubated with anti-RILP, anti-dynactin p150Glued, or anti-huntingtin antibodies and pulled down with protein A/G. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates detected RILP, dynactin p150Glued, and huntingtin in the same immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2), indicating they form a complex. Although it was reported that REST/NRSF interacts with both mutant huntingtin and wild-type huntingtin and that this interaction controls REST/NRSF function (8.Zuccato C. Tartari M. Crotti A. Goffredo D. Valenza M. Conti L. Cataudella T. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Timmusk T. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), a direct interaction was not demonstrated. To determine whether a direct interaction between wild-type or mutant huntingtin and REST/NRSF occurs, they were coexpressed in vitro. As shown in Fig. 3a, in vitro expressed RILP and REST/NRSF were coimmunoprecipitated with anti-RILP or anti-REST/NRSF antibodies, confirming our previous results. RILP and dynactin p150Glued were also coimmunoprecipitated with anti-RILP or anti-dynactin p150Glued antibodies (Fig. 3a), confirming a direct interaction between RILP and dynactin p150Glued. In contrast, when we analyzed for an interaction between REST/NRSF and either wild-type or mutant huntingtin using in vitro translated proteins, they were not coimmunoprecipitated (Fig. 3b), showing that REST/NRSF and wild-type or mutant huntingtin do not interact directly. We then looked for an interaction between huntingtin and RILP to which REST/NRSF could bind. Wild-type or mutant huntingtin and RILP were coexpressed, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-huntingtin or anti-RILP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4a, neither wild-type nor mutant huntingtin interacted directly with RILP. However, when mutant or wild-type huntingtin and RILP were coexpressed in the presence of dynactin p150Glued and immunoprecipitated with anti-huntingtin, anti-dynactin p150Glued, or anti-RILP antibodies, all three proteins were found (Fig. 4b). These results show that mutant or wild-type huntingtin and RILP interact indirectly through dynactin p150Glued. Comparing the intensities of bands, the interaction between RILP and mutant huntingtin appeared weaker than the interaction between RILP and wild-type huntingtin. The endogenous RILP-dynactin p150Glued-huntingtin complex was also found in differentiated NT2 cells, a neuron-like cell line that expresses, in addition, the neuron-specific huntingtin-associated protein HAP1 (19.Li X.J. Li S.H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 26: 1-3Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 3025-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5a, HAP1 was coimmunoprecipitated with the endogenous complex from NT2 cells. To study direct interactions, wild-type or mutant huntingtin, dynactin p150Glued, and RILP were expressed in vitro in the presence or absence of HAP1. After immunoprecipitation with anti-huntingtin or anti-RILP antibodies, Western blot analysis was conducted using anti-huntingtin or anti-RILP antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5b, huntingtin was coimmunoprecipitated with RILP in the presence or absence of HAP1, but mutant huntingtin was precipitated only in the absence of HAP1 (Fig. 5b, fourth and eighth lanes). The ratio of band densities of huntingtin versus RILP were 3.15 (Fig. 5b, seventh lane) and 1.79 (eighth lane). Expression of mutant huntingtin caused a decrease of ∼50% in the interaction of RILP and wild-type huntingtin. This suggests that HAP1 affects the interaction between mutant huntingtin, dynactin p150Glued, and RILP. In vitro translated HAP1 and REST/NRSF or HAP1 and RILP did not coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 5c), showing that neither REST/NRSF nor RILP interacts directly with HAP1. To further analyze the effect of HAP1 on complex formation, mouse striatal cells expressing wild-type or mutant huntingtin were used for coimmunoprecipitation analysis. Lysates from each cell line were prepared and incubated with anti-RILP, anti-dynactin p150Glued, anti-HAP1, or anti-huntingtin antibodies and pulled down with protein A/G. As shown in Fig. 6 (upper panel), Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates detected RILP, dynactin p150Glued, HAP1, and huntingtin in the same immunoprecipitate, indicating they form a complex. In striatal cell lines expressing mutant huntingtin, most of the RILP did not coimmunoprecipitate with anti-dynactin p150Glued, anti-HAP1, or anti-huntingtin antibodies, suggesting that mutant huntingtin causes a dissociation of RILP from the complex. Because HAP1 is expressed predominantly in neuronal cells, it may play an important role in regulating the activity of the complex. The effect of HAP1 on the translocation of REST/NRSF to the nucleus was thus studied using an RE1/NRSE-containing reporter gene. This reporter gene (pXP2-EX) is composed of the cholinergic gene locus RE1-containing promoter element linked to a luciferase reporter gene (14.Shimojo M. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6788-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7a, expression of this pXP2-EX reporter gene was suppressed in HeLa cells, whereas the same construct in which the RE1 element was inactivated by mutation (pXP2-EXmut) was not repressed. This confirms that in HeLa cells REST/NRSF localizes to the nucleus and binds to RE1/NRSE, leading to repression of RE1/NRSE-containing genes. Interestingly, overexpression of HAP1 in HeLa cells led to a significant increase in pXP2-EX expression almost to the level of inactive pXP2-EXmut. This shows that, in the presence of HAP1, REST/NRSF is not functional and likely was not translocated to the nucleus. As expected, an siRNA for HAP1 did not change reporter gene expression in HeLa cells because these cells do not express HAP1. Similarly, overexpression of HAP1 in NT2 cells did not significantly change the expression of both pXP2-EX and pXP2-EXmut. However, lowering HAP1 expression with an siRNA in NT2 cells led to repression of reporter gene expression (Fig. 7a), consistent with the requirement for HAP1 to prevent REST/NRSF nuclear translocation. To directly show the effect of HAP1 expression on the intracellular localization of REST/NRSF, expression or repression of HAP1 by siRNA was performed. HeLa or NT2 cells were treated with HAP1 siRNA or a HAP1 expression construct for 24 h, and then REST/NRSF was transfected into cells. The localization of REST/NRSF was determined by immunostaining with anti-REST/NRSF antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, whereas HAP1 was analyzed using anti-HAP1 antibody followed by Alexa Fluor 488-linked antibody. As shown in Fig. 8, in HeLa cells, REST/NRSF was detected in the nucleus. Expression of HAP1 in HeLa cells caused a shift of REST/NRSF and HAP1 to the cytosol. Used as a control, expression of HAP1 siRNA did not change REST/NRSF localization in HeLa cells. No cross-reactivity of anti-HAP1 and anti-REST/NRSF antibodies was determined. On the other hand, in NT2 cells, REST/NRSF was detected in the cytosol (Fig. 8, upper panels). Expression of HAP1 was also detected in the cytosol. Repression of HAP1 in NT2 cells treated with siRNA caused REST/NRSF to mislocalize to the nucleus. HAP1 was barely detectable, indicating that siRNA treatment effectively lowers intracellular HAP1. A new role for the huntingtin protein had been elucidated by showing its modulation of the nuclear translocation of the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF (8.Zuccato C. Tartari M. Crotti A. Goffredo D. Valenza M. Conti L. Cataudella T. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Timmusk T. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Loss of this activity in mutant huntingtin may contribute to disease pathogenesis in Huntington disease (21.Thompson L.M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 13-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, a direct interaction between huntingtin and REST/NRSF was not shown, and the mechanism by which huntingtin controls REST/NRSF localization was unclear. We reported that RILP is also required for the translocation of REST/NRSF into the nucleus and controls neuronal gene expression (16.Shimojo M. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 9025-9031Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, both RILP and huntingtin appear to have the same function. To elucidate the role of RILP, we identified dynactin p150Glued as its interacting protein. Similarly, it was reported that dynactin p150Glued and huntingtin interact (22.Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 23.Block-Galarza J. Chase K.O. Sapp E. Vaughn K.T. Vallee R.B. Di-Figlia M. Aronin N. Neuroreport. 1997; 8: 2247-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that REST/NRSF interacts with huntingtin, whereas mutant huntingtin causes abnormal neuronal REST/NRSF nuclear localization (8.Zuccato C. Tartari M. Crotti A. Goffredo D. Valenza M. Conti L. Cataudella T. Leavitt B.R. Hayden M.R. Timmusk T. Rigamonti D. Cattaneo E. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 76-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). We have employed coimmunoprecipitation analysis using HeLa cells to show that RILP, dynactin p150Glued, and huntingtin interact and form a complex. Using in vitro expression of these proteins, we have shown that huntingtin does not directly interact with REST/NRSF, but instead interacts with dynactin p150Glued, which interacts in turn with RILP, a protein shown to directly interact with REST/NRSF. Thus, our data suggest that REST/NRSF, dynactin p150Glued, huntingtin, and RILP form a quaternary complex involved in the translocation of REST/NRSF, likely through a microtubule pathway, into the nucleus. In NT2 neuronal cells, we found that the complex additionally contains HAP1, consistent with reports that HAP1 interacts with dynactin p150Glued and huntingtin (20.Rong J. Li S.H. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 3025-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 22.Schroer T.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 20: 759-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 24.Li S.H. Gutekunst C.A. Hersch S.M. Li X.J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1261-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results further suggest that HAP1 affects the interaction of mutant huntingtin with the complex and leads to a weakening of the interaction of RILP with the complex. However, HAP1 does not affect this interaction in the presence of wild-type huntingtin. This study further suggests that mutant polyQ-huntingtin binding to the REST/NRSF-RILP-dynactin-HAP1 complex alters its conformation, permitting REST/NRSF to inappropriately be transported to the nucleus, resulting in the repression of a host of neuronal genes. To support this hypothesis, we used mouse striatal cell lines established from wild-type and mutant huntingtin knock-in embryos (25.Wheeler V.C. White J.K. Gutekunst C.A. Vrbanac V. Weaver M. Li X.J. Li S.H. Yi H. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Hersch S. Auerbach W. Joyner A.L. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 503-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Gel filtration of extracts from these cells showed that RILP in the cell line expressing wild-type huntingtin is detected in a high molecular weight fraction indicative of a complex with dynactin p150Glued, huntingtin, and RILP. However, in mutant huntingtin-expressing cells, the majority of RILP is detected in a lower molecular weight fraction than found in wild-type huntingtin-expressing cells. 3M. Shimojo, manuscript in preparation. This is consistent with the data in this study showing that HAP1 affected the interaction between mutant huntingtin, dynactin p150Glued, and RILP in the complex and caused release of RILP from the complex. Reporter gene analysis showed that when HAP1 is overexpressed in a non-neuronal cell line such as HeLa, REST/NRSF gene repression is reversed. Conversely, lowering HAP1 expression in a neuronal cell such as NT2 leads to REST/NRSF repression of an RE1/NRSE-containing gene. In accordance with these data, our results clearly show that in non-neuronal cells, which do not express HAP1, REST/NRSF localizes to the nucleus. However, REST/NRSF localizes to the cytosol when HAP1 is overexpressed. In NT2 neuronal cells, REST/NRSF localizes normally to the cytosol. Repression of HAP1 causes REST/NRSF to abnormally localize to the nucleus. These results show that HAP1, likely through its interaction with the RILP-dynactin-huntingtin complex, prevents the complex from translocating REST/NRSF to the nucleus, making HAP1 a key regulator of REST/NRSF activity. Thus, the paradox of how both RILP and huntingtin affect REST/NRSF trafficking to the nucleus appears to be answered. This study, coupled with others, shows that both RILP and huntingtin interact directly with dynactin p150Glued to form a complex. REST/NRSF binds to this complex through a direct interaction with RILP. In the absence of HAP1, as in non-neuronal cells, this complex traffics REST/NRSF to the nucleus. In neuronal cells, HAP1 binds to huntingtin and causes the retention of the complex in the cytosol. There are undoubtedly other proteins involved in this process, which can now be sought. Finally, this study has described a previously unidentified trafficking complex; provided new insights into the roles of huntingtin, HAP1, dynactin p150Glued, and RILP in the regulation of neuron-specific gene expression by controlling REST/NRSF trafficking; and suggested a new target for Huntington disease.

Renal ischemia or the loss of blood flow to the kidneys has been widely associated with tubular and endothelial injury but rarely has been shown to induce podocyte damage and disruption of the slit diaphragm. In this study, we have used an in vivo rat ischemic model to demonstrate that renal ischemia induces podocyte effacement with loss of slit diaphragm and proteinuria. Biochemical analysis of the ischemic glomerulus shows that ischemia induces rapid loss of interaction between slit diaphragm junctional proteins Neph1 and ZO-1. To further understand the effect of ischemia on molecular interactions between slit diaphragm proteins, a cell culture model was employed to study the binding between Neph1 and ZO-1. Under physiologic conditions, Neph1 co-localized with ZO-1 at cell-cell contacts in cultured human podocytes. Induction of injury by ATP depletion resulted in rapid loss of Neph1 and ZO-1 binding and redistribution of Neph1 and ZO-1 proteins from cell membrane to the cytoplasm. Recovery resulted in increased Neph1 tyrosine phosphorylation, restoring Neph1 and ZO-1 binding and their localization at the cell membrane. We further demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Neph1 mediated by Fyn results in significantly increased Neph1 and ZO-1 binding, suggesting a critical role for Neph1 tyrosine phosphorylation in reorganizing the Neph1-ZO-1 complex. This study documents that renal ischemia induces dynamic changes in the molecular interactions between slit diaphragm proteins, leading to podocyte damage and proteinuria.

This study documents that renal ischemia induces dynamic changes in the molecular interactions between slit diaphragm proteins, leading to podocyte damage and proteinuria. Glomerular diseases of the kidney are the major cause of end stage renal disease worldwide. Diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, and ischemia, are associated with glomerular dysfunction that leads to proteinuria and loss of kidney function. Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is the major cause of acute renal failure as observed in the native kidneys and after renal transplantation with a more than 50! mortality rate (1Molitoris B.A. Melnikov V.Y. Okusa M.D. Himmelfarb J. Nat. Clin. Pract. Nephrol. 2008; 4: 154-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Molitoris B.A. Sutton T.A. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). There is no specific treatment for such a devastating disease, primarily due to lack of understanding of the pathophysiology and the mechanism of progression of this disease. Identification of major cellular pathways affected by ischemia-reperfusion is an active area of research and has revealed many molecular targets for therapeutic intervention (3Kelly K.J. Molitoris B.A. Semin Nephrol. 2000; 20: 4-19PubMed Google Scholar, 4Molitoris B.A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 265-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 5Parikh C.R. Edelstein C.L. Devarajan P. Cantley L. J. Investig. Med. 2007; 55: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).Glomerular podocytes contribute to the kidney filtration barrier and have a footlike appearance of numerous interdigitating processes that arise from their cell bodies and completely cover the glomerular basement membrane. The interdigitation of foot processes is linked via 40 nm wide porous slits commonly known as slit diaphragms (6Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Patrakka J. Cell. 2006; 125: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These are specialized cell junctions that constitute an important component of the glomerular filtration barrier, restricting the passage of proteins and solutes into urine. Increasing evidence now suggests that injuries to the glomerulus leads to podocyte effacement and loss of slit diaphragm structure/function, resulting in proteinuria. Although a significant amount of work has been done to study the effects of renal ischemia on kidney tubules and endothelium (2Molitoris B.A. Sutton T.A. Kidney Int. 2004; 66: 496-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), relatively less is known about the effects of ischemia on glomerular podocytes. Moreover, ischemia-induced changes in the molecular organization of slit diaphragm proteins have never been studied.Recent efforts to understand the mechanisms underlying the loss of slit diaphragm have led to the identification of a number of proteins that are specifically localized at the foot process in podocytes. It is believed that the slit diaphragm is formed by homophilic and heterophilic interactions between the extracellular domains of various podocyte-specific proteins, including Nephrin, Neph1, Fat1, and Fat2 (6Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Patrakka J. Cell. 2006; 125: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Proteins such as ZO-1, CD2AP, Nck, and Grb2 are thought to connect the slit diaphragm membrane proteins to the actin microfilaments (7Liu X.L. Kilpelainen P. Hellman U. Sun Y. Wartiovaara J.

Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1346-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). In addition to their ability to provide structural integrity to the slit diaphragm, recent reports suggest that these proteins also participate in the important signaling events that help maintain the physiologic glomerular filtration function (8Verma R. Kovari I. Soofi A. Nihalani D. Patrie K. Holzman L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1346-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 9Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Nat. Clin. Pract.

The present study provides evidence that the ischemic injury induces dynamic changes in the protein complexes at the slit diaphragm with a corresponding loss of actin cytoskeleton and proteinuria.Neph1, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is structurally related to nephrin (11Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G. Hawkins E. Barrish J.P. Mathur B.N. Turner C.A. Geske R. Montgomery C.A. Starbuck M. Brandt M. Gupta A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zambrowicz B.P. Powell D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) and consists of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like repeats, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain of ∼198–235 amino acids (12Sellin L. Huber T.B. Gerke P. Quack I. Pavenstadt H. Walz G. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In the glomerulus, Nephrin and Neph1 are expressed in podocytes and are co-localized at the insertion site of the slit diaphragm (13Barletta G.M. Kovari I.A. Verma R.K. Kerjaschki D. Holzman L.B. J.

Nephrol. 2003; 14: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Unlike Nephrin, which is primarily localized in the kidney, Neph1 is also found in other tissues, including the brain, heart, and liver (11Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G. Hawkins E. Barrish J.P. Mathur B.N. Turner C.A. Geske R. Montgomery C.A. Starbuck M. Brandt M. Gupta A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zambrowicz B.P. Powell D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Genetic analysis of the NEPH1 gene suggests that it belongs to a family of three closely related proteins (Neph1, Neph2, and Neph3) that bind to the carboxyl-terminal domain of podocin. Although little characterization of Neph1 has been published, deletion of mouse Neph1 results in a podocyte effacement phenotype with proteinuria and early postnatal death similar to Nephrin (11Donoviel D.B. Freed D.D. Vogel H. Potter D.G. Hawkins E. Barrish J.P. Mathur B.N. Turner C.A. Geske R. Montgomery C.A. Starbuck M. Brandt M. Gupta A. Ramirez-Solis R. Zambrowicz B.P. Powell D.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 4829-4836Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). It is widely believed that the extracellular domains of Neph1 and Nephrin form a complex that is located at the foot process and together provide a structural framework for the slit diaphragm. Interaction of Neph1 and Nephrin at the intracellular level with various actin-associated proteins, including CD2AP, ZO-1, CASK, IQGAP1, β-arrestin, Nck, Grb2, α-actinin 4, and Synaptopodin, suggests their participation in transducing signals that induce actin polymerization (6Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Patrakka J. Cell. 2006; 125: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Patari-Sampo A. Ihalmo P. Holthofer H. Ann.

Indeed, engagement of the extracellular domains of either Nephrin or Neph1 results in Fyn-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins on specific tyrosine residues and recruitment of various cytoskeleton proteins, including Nck and Grb2 (8Verma R.

Chem. 2003; 278: 20716-20723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whereas Nck recruitment to Nephrin was necessary for actin polymerization, Grb2 recruitment to Neph1 was required for actin polymerization (8Verma R. Kovari I. Soofi A. Nihalani D. Patrie K. Holzman L.B. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1346-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 17Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was found that Nephrin and Neph1 act cooperatively to induce actin reorganization in a cell culture model system (17Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).Apart from its interaction with adaptor protein Grb2, through a conserved Src homology 2 binding site, the cytoplasmic tail of Neph1 interacts with the PDZ1 domain of ZO-1 (9Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Nat. Clin. Pract. Nephrol. 2006; 2: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Huber T.B. Schmidts M. Gerke P. Schermer B. Zahn A. Hartleben B. Sellin L. Walz G. Benzing T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13417-13421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). ZO-1 is a 225-kDa multidomain, membrane-associated adaptor protein of the MAGUK protein family (20Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar). ZO-1 plays a role by sealing tight junctions and organizing the components of the tight junction and linking them to the cortical actin cytoskeleton (20Fanning A.S. Jameson B.J. Jesaitis L.A. Anderson J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29745-29753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar, 21Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J.

ZO-1 is localized at the cytoplasmic face of intercellular junctions and associates with proteins such as ZO-2, F-actin, α-actinin 4, α- and β-catenins, and occludins (19Huber T.B. Schmidts M. Gerke P. Schermer B. Zahn A. Hartleben B. Sellin L. Walz G. Benzing T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 13417-13421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21Denker B.M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F1-F9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ZO-1 may function in organizing signal transduction and transmembrane protein complexes through its association with Neph1 at the slit diaphragm. Studies from various epithelial cell lines suggest that alterations in ZO-1 expression, localization, and phosphorylation are associated with increased paracellular permeability (23Kurihara H. Anderson J.M. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7075-7079Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 24Kurihara H. Anderson J.M. Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. Am. J.

Diabetes. 2006; 55: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Similar changes in ZO-1 expression and localization were recently reported in a diabetic nephropathy mouse model, where it was also associated with proteinuria and loss of glomerular function (25Rincon-Choles H. Vasylyeva T.L. Pergola P.E. Bhandari B. Bhandari K. Zhang J.H. Wang W. Gorin Y. Barnes J.L. Abboud H.E. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 894-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Various studies now suggest that the foot processes of podocytes respond to glomerular injury in a dynamic fashion by regulating their associated protein complexes, thus resulting in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (6Tryggvason K. Pikkarainen T. Patrakka J. Cell. 2006; 125: 221-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 15Patari-Sampo A. Ihalmo P. Holthofer H. Ann.

Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 3611-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that glomerular injury affects the interactions of and distribution of ZO-1, resulting in loss of slit diaphragm structure. Since interaction of ZO-1 with Neph1 links Neph1 to the cytoskeleton, we wanted to examine the possibility that glomerular injury leads to the dissociation of this complex.In this study, we demonstrate that renal ischemia induces significant podocyte effacement with a corresponding loss of interaction between slit diaphragm proteins Neph1 and ZO-1. The recovery from injury induces Neph1 tyrosine phosphorylation and restores this interaction. Our results further suggest a critical role for Neph1 tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by Fyn in the assembly of Neph1 and ZO-1 complex during renal ischemia.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal purified antibody to Neph1 was described previously (13Barletta G.M.

Restriction digestion and DNA sequencing were used to validate all construct sequences.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10! fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 200 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Roche Applied Science). The transfections were performed using Fugene-6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The human podocyte cell line was graciously provided by Dr. Moin Saleem and was cultured in RPMI 1640-based medium, as described previously (30Saleem M.A. Ni L. Witherden I. Tryggvason K.

Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3301-3313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Before depletion, cells were washed three times with PBS. Depleted medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without glucose, pyruvate, or amino acids) was added to control plates, and depleted medium containing 0.1 μm antimycin A was added to the experimental plates. The cells were returned to the incubator for the indicated ATP depletion periods. The cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1! SDS, 1! Nonidet P-40, 0.5! sodium deoxycholate, and 100 mm potassium iodide).Subcellular Fractionation—All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Podocyte cells in 150-mm flasks were washed three times with PBS, and 1 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2) containing protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) was added to each flask. Cells were collected by scraping with a scraper and lysed by using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was spun at 14,000 rpm for 3 s in a tabletop microcentrifuge, and the pellet containing nuclei was discarded. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA100.3 rotor. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was washed twice with PBS. Both fractions were reconstituted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting.Animals and Acute Renal Ischemia—Male Sprague-Dawley rats were obtained from Harlan Laboratories (Indianapolis, IN). All experiments were conducted in accordance with NIH Guidelines (57National Institutes of Health The Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. National Academy Press, Washington, DC1996Google Scholar) and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Male rats weighing 250–300 g were anesthetized intraperitoneally with an injection of pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). They were then placed on a homeothermic table to maintain a core temperature of 37 °C. A midline incision was made, and the renal pedicles were isolated. Bilateral ischemia was induced by clamping the renal pedicles for 45 min with microserrefines. After removal of the microserrefines, reperfusion was observed visually. Two milliliters of prewarmed saline was instilled into the abdominal cavity prior to closure of the abdominal incision. Animals were allowed to recover on the homeothermic pad to maintain body temperature until the righting reflex was restored. Reperfusion time varied from 0 min to 4 h. The serum creatinine concentration was determined from the blood samples collected from control and ischemic rats using the Creatinine Analyzer 2 (Beckman). The urine albumin/creatinine ratio was determined from urine of control and ischemic rats obtained in metabolic cages by a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for urine albumin (Nephrat II; Exocell Inc.) and the Jaffe reaction for urine creatinine (Creatinine Companion; Exocell).Glomerular Isolation—Rat glomeruli were isolated by graded sieving, as described previously (17Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The average purity of the rat glomerular preparations was 80–90!. Glomeruli were resuspended at a concentration of 10,000 glomeruli/ml of extraction buffer.Pull-down—Wherever indicated, GST-Neph1CD recombinant protein was expressed and purified from TKB1 Escherichia coli (Stratagene) to induce tyrosine phosphorylation. Purified GST fusion proteins were incubated with immunoprecipitated ZO-1 on protein G-agarose beads. After washing with PBS containing 0.1! Tween 20, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride, protein complexes were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Eluate was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis prior to immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments were performed using the procedures described previously (17Garg P.

Detergent-insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 2 min).Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells were grown on coverslips and fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde, followed by permeabilization with 0.1! SDS. Antibodies were diluted in 3! bovine serum albumin in PBS, and primary antibodies were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C followed by PBS washes and secondary antibody incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Following PBS washes, the coverslips were mounted using GelMount. All experiments were conducted using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ultraview confocal microscope system mounted on a Nikon TE 2000U inverted microscope, using Nikon ×100, numerical aperture 1.4 oil immersion planapochromatic objectives (Melville, NY). The system is equipped with an Ixon air-cooled EMCCD 12-bit camera (Andor). Image volumes were collected by collecting a sequential vertical series of images, each 0.2 μm apart. Cells were labeled for ZO-1 (Alexa 488), F-actin (phalloidin), and Neph-1 (Cy5) using the 488-, 568-, and 633-nm laser lines of the argon and helium-neon lasers. Chromatic aberration between the green and far red channel was calculated using fluorescent beads to be ∼0.2 μm. Image analysis was conducted using Image J software. For Pearson's correlation coefficient (Rr) determination, single image planes were selected. After background subtraction, the ZO-1 image was thresholded and used to create a binary mask for analysis of the Rr. Regions of interest were selected to distinguish junctional areas and cytosol. The integrated mean intensity of the same regions of interest was calculated on the original image planes after image subtraction. Representative images from a minimum of three experiments are shown, and analysis was performed on at least eight image fields for each time point.Electron Microscopy—Preparation of samples for electron microscopy was performed by standard methods (17Garg P. Verma R. Nihalani D. Johnstone D.B. Holzman L.B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 27: 8698-8712Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). An infrarenal aortic cannula (PE 240 tubing) was introduced, and both kidneys were fixed by perfusion with a 4! paraformaldehyde solution at 120 mm Hg pressure for 5 min (∼50 ml/min). The kidneys were then diced and stored in 4! paraformaldehyde. Selected samples containing glomeruli were thin-sectioned and examined by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. At least 10 glomeruli from each kidney were examined before representative images were chosen.RESULTSIschemic Injury to Rat Kidney Induces Podocyte Effacement and Loss of Slit Diaphragm—The effect of ischemia on tubular cell damage has been studied extensively; however, ischemia-induced loss of glomerular filtration barrier slit diaphragm has rarely been addressed. To investigate the changes induced by ischemia, we used an in vivo rat model that uses bilateral clamping of the renal arteries (33Ashworth S.L. Wean S.E. Campos S.B. Temm-Grove C.J. Southgate E.L. Vrhovski B. Gunning P. Weinberger R.P. Molitoris B.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F988-F996Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The kidney sections were analyzed for structural changes in the glomerulus and podocytes by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1A). Both scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy pictures showed podocytes exhibiting dramatic morphological changes, including gradual effacement in response to ischemia (Fig. 1A). After 45 min of ischemia, podocytes appeared swollen with narrowed filtration slits (Fig. 1A). After 4 h of recovery, loss of the morphological integrity of podocytes and their processes along with the loss of slit diaphragms was still observed (Fig. 1A). In addition, an increase in microvillus formation (Fig. 1A) was apparent, which indicates proteinuric conditions. Indeed, the analysis of urine from ischemic rats showed a significant increase in protein excretion postischemia (Fig. 1B).Ischemic Injury to Rat Glomerulus Results in Loss of Neph1 Interaction with ZO-1 and Nephrin—We wanted to further determine if ischemia induces changes in the molecular interactions between slit diaphragm proteins that are critical for the maintenance of integrity of the slit diaphragm junction (6Tryggvason K.

The E3L protein encoded by vaccinia virus is known to impair phosphorylation and activation of IRF-3. Kinases in addition to IκB kinase-related kinases are implicated in the IRF-3-dependent antiviral response. To test in human cells the role of the protein kinase regulated by RNA (PKR) in IRF-3 activation, HeLa cells made stably deficient in PKR using an RNA interference strategy were compared with PKR-sufficient cells. Rapid phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 were detected in PKR-sufficient cells following infection with E3L deletion mutant (ΔE3L) virus. By contrast, the full IRF-3 activation response was largely abolished in PKR-deficient cells. The ΔE3L virus-induced IRF-3 activation seen in PKR-sufficient cells was diminished by treatment with cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside. Furthermore, the vaccinia mutant ts23, which displays increased viral double-stranded RNA production at 39 °C, induced PKR-dependent IRF-3 phosphorylation at 39 °C but not at 31 °C. Both IRF-3 phosphorylation and cell apoptosis induced by infection with ΔE3L virus were dependent upon RIG-I-like receptor signal transduction components, including the adapter IPS-1.

Type I IFN is an important component of the host antiviral innate immune response and subsequent defenses mounted against viral infection (2.Yoneyama M. Fujita T. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2002; 14: 432-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Among the transcription factors important in the induction of type I interferons by the RLR and TLR signaling cascades is interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) (6.Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 7.Tamura T. Yanai H. Savitsky D. Taniguchi T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2008; 26: 535-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Constitutively expressed IRF-3 resides in the cytosol in an inactive form. Following virus infection, IRF-3 is activated by phosphorylation, dimerization, translocation to the nucleus, and association with CREB-binding protein/p300 (6.Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Activation of IRF-3 is regulated by two IKK-related kinases, TBK-1 and IKKϵ, in a two-step manner (8.Panne D. McWhirter S.M. Maniatis T. Harrison S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22816-22822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 9.Fitzgerald K.A. McWhirter S.M. Faia K.L. Rowe D.C. Latz E. Golenbock D.T. Coyle A.J. Liao S.M. Maniatis T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2029) Google Scholar). The first-step phosphorylation of IRF-3 occurs at the C-terminal serine/threonine cluster between amino acids 396 and 405. This phosphorylation alleviates autoinhibition, thereby allowing interaction with CREB-binding protein, and facilitates the second-step phosphorylation at serines 385 and 386, which is required for IRF-3 dimerization (8.Panne D.

Activated IRF-3 together with NF-κB and activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2)/c-Jun form a transcriptionally competent enhanceosome to induce the synthesis of type I IFNs, including IFN-β (4.Borden E.C.

The importance of IRF-3 in the induction of IFNs is further illustrated by the large number of viruses that have evolved strategies to antagonize the production of IFNs through either inhibition of IRF-3 activation or by degradation of IRF-3 (11.Haller O. Kochs G. Weber F. Virology. 2006; 344: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 12.Randall R.E. Goodbourn S. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Triphosphate-containing dsRNA represents one of the important viral triggers for activation of the host innate immune response. Production of dsRNA occurs during the life cycle of several viruses, both RNA viruses and DNA viruses (13.Weber F. Wagner V. Rasmussen S.B. Hartmann R. Paludan S.R. J.

Biol. 2006; 81: 369-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Vaccinia virus (VV), a DNA virus, produces significant amounts of dsRNA in infected cells as a consequence of overlapping convergent transcription that occurs during the intermediate and late replication phases (13.Weber F. Wagner V. Rasmussen S.B. Hartmann R. Paludan S.R. J. Virol. 2006; 80: 5059-5064Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar, 14.Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). To counteract the cellular innate immune response triggered by viral dsRNA, vaccinia virus has evolved strategies to antagonize IFN signaling, IFN action, and apoptosis (17.Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar, 19.Seet B.T. Johnston J.B. Brunetti C.R. Barrett J.W. Everett H. Cameron C. Sypula J. Nazarian S.H. Lucas A. McFadden G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 377-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). One viral gene important in the antagonism is E3L (14.Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 17.Samuel C.E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 778-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). The E3L protein of VV is synthesized early during infection and functions as a key pathogenesis factor that affects the outcome of the virus-host interaction. E3L is an important virulence gene both in cultured cells and in the mouse model (14.Jacobs B.L. Langland J.O. Virology. 1996; 219: 339-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 20.Brandt T.A. Jacobs B.L. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 850-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The E3L protein mediates IFN resistance, promotes virus growth, and impairs virus-mediated apoptosis. VV with the E3L gene deleted (ΔE3L) shows a restricted host range and induces apoptosis in cell culture (21.Kibler K.V. Shors T. Perkins K.B. Zeman C.C. Banaszak M.P. Biesterfeldt J. Langland J.O.

Among the mechanisms by which E3L interferes with the host innate immune defense is by blocking the phosphorylation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 (23.Smith E.J. Marie I. Prakash A. Garcia-Sastre A. Levy D.E. J.

Two functional domains have been characterized in the E3L protein as follows: a C-terminal dsRNA-binding domain (RBM) identified by homology to the repeated RBM of PKR (15.McCormack S.J. Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1992; 188: 47-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 26.Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Virology. 1993; 194: 537-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27.Ho C.K. Shuman S. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2611-2614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and an N-terminal Z-DNA-binding domain (ZBM) identified by homology to the repeated ZBM of ADAR1 (28.Kim Y.G. Muralinath M. Brandt T. Pearcy M. Hauns K. Lowenhaupt K. Jacobs B.L. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6974-6979Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 29.Patterson J.B. Samuel C.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5376-5388Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). The dsRNA regulated kinase, PKR, is a principal cellular determinant of the phenotype characteristically seen in ΔE3L mutant virus-infected cells, including impaired virus multiplication and enhanced apoptotic response in human HeLa cells (30.Zhang P. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in Huh-7 cells (31.Arsenio J. Deschambault Y. Cao J. Virology. 2008; 377: 124-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In addition to PKR's well established antiviral role through phosphorylation of eIF-2α and subsequent translation inhibition (4.Borden E.C. Sen G.C. Uze G. Silverman R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Foster G.R. Stark G.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 32.Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7603-7606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), PKR also is implicated as an effector of multiple signaling transduction pathways, including the NF-κB and p38 MAPK pathways (18.Toth A.M. Zhang P. Das S. George C.X. Samuel C.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2006; 81: 369-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33.Williams B.R. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6112-6120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PKR was among the first pathogen recognition receptors identified and subsequently has been shown to be important in regulating IFN-β production in response to dsRNA or virus, as illustrated by West Nile virus (18.Toth A.M. Zhang P. Das S. George C.X. Samuel C.E. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2006; 81: 369-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 33.Williams B.R.

However, the underlying mechanism as to how PKR mediates the host innate immune response and IFN production has not been elucidated. The ability of E3L to impair the host innate immune response, including IRF-3 activation, coupled with the finding that loss of PKR expression in human HeLa cells complements the E3L deletion mutant phenotype of VV, led us to test whether PKR contributes to the activation of IRF-3 in VV-infected cells. Our results established that full IRF-3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation are mediated in part by PKR in cells infected with vaccinia virus mutants that either lack E3L entirely (ΔE3L) or that overexpress dsRNA (ts23). Using an siRNA strategy, RIG-I, mda-5, and IPS-1 were found to affect the ΔE3L-induced IRF-3 activation in addition to PKR, but TRIF did not. Interestingly, suppression of IPS-1 and IRF-3 also impaired the ΔE3L-induced apoptotic response. These findings further establish PKR not only as a downstream effector of IFN action but also as an important upstream effector of signal transduction leading to IRF-3 activation. Cells and Viruses—HeLa, baby hamster kidney, and RK13 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 5 or 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), respectively, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) as described previously (36.Zhang P. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8192-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). HeLa cells in which PKR expression is stably knocked down (PKRkd) and a PKR knockdown control (PKRkd-con) were maintained in the above medium containing 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). The Copenhagen strain (VC-2) of wild-type (WT) vaccinia virus and mutants deleted for the E3L gene (ΔE3L), the 83 N-terminal amino acids of E3L (Δ83N), or the 26 C-terminal amino acids of E3L (Δ26C) were provided by B. Jacobs (Arizona State University, Tempe). ts23 mutant that displays an increased dsRNA synthesis at (39 °C) was provided by R. Condit (University of Florida, Gainesville). Cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Ara C, Sigma, C1768) treatment (10 μg/ml) was initiated 2 h before virus infection and was maintained throughout the 10-h incubation period. Vaccinia virus infections were carried out at a multiplicity of infection of 5. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on RK13 cells (30.Zhang P. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J.

Briefly, HeLa cells at 30–50% confluency were transfected with 50 pmol of siRNA per well (12-well plate) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h after the first transfection, cells were re-seeded into 12-well plates at 1.5 × 105 cells per well. After overnight incubation, the second transfection with siRNA was performed; cells were infected with vaccinia virus (multiplicity of infection 5) at 48 h after the second transfection. Western Immunoblot Analyses—Whole cell extracts were prepared in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) as described previously (36.Zhang P. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8192-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For analysis of IRF-3 phosphorylation, 50 mm NaF and 2 mm Na2VO3 were included in the extract buffer. Proteins were fractionated by electrophoresis on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked, and then probed with an appropriate dilution of primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3% (w/v) skim milk. Antibodies used to detect human IRF-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (sc-9082), or were generously provided by M. David (University of California, San Diego) and, against IRF-3 phosphorylated at Ser-396, by J. Hiscott (McGill University, Montreal). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were used to detect human IPS-1 (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc.), human TRIF (Alexis Biochemicals Inc.), human PKR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), phospho-PKR(Thr-446) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), eIF-2α (Cell Signaling Technology), and phospho-eIF-2α(Ser-51) (Cell Signaling Technology); rabbit polyclonal antibody against purified vaccinia virus virions was as described previously (30.Zhang P. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Mouse monoclonal antibodies were used to detect poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) (Pharmingen), β-actin (Sigma), and α-tubulin (Sigma). Western immunoblot detection was performed with IRDye 800CW-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or IRDye 680-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody according to the manufacturer's protocols (LI-COR). Immunoreactive bands were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imaging system. Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were seeded onto coverslips (30–50% confluency) and infected with vaccinia virus (multiplicity of infection of 5) or left uninfected as indicated. Cells were fixed at 9 h after infection with 2% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C overnight and permeabilized with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were incubated with antibody against IRF-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., sc-9082) at 37 °C for 1 h, rinsed three times with PBS, and then incubated with secondary anti-rabbit antibody (1:500, Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold antifade reagent with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen); stained samples were visualized using an Olympus fluorescence microscope. PKR Enhances and E3L Antagonizes IRF-3 Phosphorylation in Vaccinia Virus-infected Cells—To test whether PKR plays a role in the activation of transcription factor IRF-3, we first examined the phosphorylation of IRF-3 in PKR-deficient compared with PKR-sufficient HeLa cells following infection with either WT or ΔE3L mutant VV (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of IRF-3 was assessed by a reduction in gel mobility on SDS-PAGE as described by Hiscott and co-workers (41.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). One major lower band corresponding to unphosphorylated IRF-3 and a second more minor upper IRF-3 band corresponding to an N-terminal phosphorylated IRF-3 form were detected in uninfected cells, both PKR-sufficient and PKR-deficient cells (Fig. 1A, lanes 1, 4, and 7). This pattern of IRF-3 mobility is comparable with that seen earlier in uninfected cells (41.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol.

The cells stable-deficient in PKR generated by a short hairpin RNA interference silencing strategy (PKRkd) possessed <5% of the PKR protein present in parental (PKR+) or puromycin-resistant knockdown control (PKRkd-con) cells (Fig. 1A), as described previously (30.Zhang P. Jacobs B.L. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 36.Zhang P. Samuel C.E. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 8192-8200Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). By contrast, in cells infected for 10 h with WT virus (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 5, and 8), the ratios of the two IRF-3 bands were reversed; the upper band corresponding to the N-terminal phosphorylated form of IRF-3 was more abundant than the unphosphorylated lower band in VV-infected PKR-sufficient and -deficient cells, again the anticipated pattern of IRF-3 mobility under conditions of virus infection (41.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, in cells infected with the ΔE3L mutant, two additional IRF-3 forms, corresponding to the C-terminal phosphorylation of IRF-3 (41.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), were seen in the two PKR-sufficient cell lines (PKR+ and PKRkd-con) (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 9). By contrast, in the PKRkd cells these phosphorylated IRF-3 species were substantially reduced (Fig. 1A, lane 6). The slower mobility of the C-terminally phosphorylated IRF-3 (41.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42.Servant M.J. ten Oever B. LePage C. Conti L. Gessani S. Julkunen I. Lin R. Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 355-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) was confirmed using antibody against IRF-3 phosphorylated at serine 396 (data not shown, see Fig. 5A). These findings indicate that PKR plays a role in the process of vaccinia virus-induced IRF-3 C-terminal phosphorylation and that the viral E3L protein impairs this PKR-dependent IRF-3 modification. IRF-3 Phosphorylation and Nuclear Localization Are Dependent upon PKR in ΔE3L Mutant-infected Cells—The phosphorylation of IRF-3 on Ser and Thr in the C-terminal region, which corresponds to the most slowly migrating forms of IRF-3 on SDS-PAGE, leads to IRF-3 activation and the cytoplasmic to nuclear translocation of the factor (41.Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Wathelet M.G. Lin C.H. Parekh B.S. Ronco L.V. Howley P.M. Maniatis T. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 507-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further verify that the ΔE3L virus-induced IRF-3 phosphorylation was modulated by the PKR protein, we carried out indirect immunofluorescence microscopy to assess the subcellular distribution of IRF-3. As shown in Fig. 1B, the latent IRF-3 protein showed a cytoplasmic distribution in the mock-infected cells, both PKR-sufficient and -deficient (Fig. 1B, left panel). Infection with WT VV did not alter the diffuse IRF-3 cytosolic localization pattern (Fig. 1B, middle panel). However, infection with the ΔE3L mutant virus resulted in the nuclear accumulation of IRF-3 protein in PKR-sufficient (PKR+ or PKRkd-con) but not in PKR-deficient (PKRkd) cells (Fig. 1B, right panel). These images suggest that the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 induced by infection with ΔE3L mutant virus, in addition to the C-terminal phosphorylation, was impaired in the absence of PKR. We next examined the phosphorylation of IRF-3 in the three cells lines after increasing times following vaccinia virus infection (Fig. 1C). Similar to the results shown in Fig. 1A at 10 h after infection, the IRF-3 phosphorylation events were marginally detectable in mock or WT virus-infected HeLa cells regardless of PKR expression level (Fig. 1C, left panel, lanes 1–15). However, in ΔE3L virus-infected PKR-sufficient HeLa cells, the phosphorylated IRF-3 proteins were detected as early as 3–6 h after infection (Fig. 1C, lanes 17 and 18 and 27 and 28). Furthermore, the IRF-3 phosphorylation products increased in abundance with time after infection of PKR-sufficient cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 19 and 20 and 29 and 30). In ΔE3L mutant-infected PKR-deficient PKRkd cells, the C-terminal region phosphorylation of IRF-3 was effectively abolished, even at 12 h after infection (Fig. 1C, lanes 22–25). Vaccinia Virus Induction of IRF-3 Phosphorylation Is Modulated by Ara C Treatment and Displays a ts23 Phenotype—Because PKR knockdown in HeLa cells abrogated IRF-3 activation induced by the infection with the ΔE3L mutant virus, and because a common feature shared between the viral E3L and cellular PKR proteins is their ability to bind dsRNA, we hypothesized that viral dsRNA is likely a principal inducer of IRF-3 activation in vivo in ΔE3L-infected PKR-sufficient cells. Also, the time after infection when the phosphorylation of IRF-3 significantly increased, between 6 and 9 h, paralleled the time c"
https://openalex.org/W2107024517,"We developed a composite machine-learning based algorithm, called ANGLOR, to predict real-value protein backbone torsion angles from amino acid sequences. The input features of ANGLOR include sequence profiles, predicted secondary structure and solvent accessibility. In a large-scale benchmarking test, the mean absolute error (MAE) of the phi/psi prediction is 28 degrees/46 degrees , which is approximately 10% lower than that generated by software in literature. The prediction is statistically different from a random predictor (or a purely secondary-structure-based predictor) with p-value <1.0 x 10(-300) (or <1.0 x 10(-148)) by Wilcoxon signed rank test. For some residues (ILE, LEU, PRO and VAL) and especially the residues in helix and buried regions, the MAE of phi angles is much smaller (10-20 degrees ) than that in other environments. Thus, although the average accuracy of the ANGLOR prediction is still low, the portion of the accurately predicted dihedral angles may be useful in assisting protein fold recognition and ab initio 3D structure modeling."

Whether oseltamivir absorption is adequate in severe influenza is unknown. We measured the steady state, plasma concentrations of nasogastrically administered oseltamivir 150 mg bid and its active metabolite, oseltamivir carboxylate (OC), in three, mechanically ventilated patients with severe H5N1 (male, 30 yrs; pregnant female, 22 yrs) and severe H3N2 (female, 76 yrs). Treatments were started 6, 7 and 8 days after illness onset, respectively. Both females were sampled while on continuous venovenous haemofiltration. Admission and follow up specimens (trachea, nose, throat, rectum, blood) were tested for RNA viral load by reverse transcriptase PCR. In vitro virus susceptibility to OC was measured by a neuraminidase inhibition assay. Admission creatinine clearances were 66 (male, H5N1), 82 (female, H5N1) and 6 (H3N2) ml/min. Corresponding AUC0–12 values (5932, 10,951 and 34,670 ng.h/ml) and trough OC concentrations (376, 575 and 2730 ng/ml) were higher than previously reported in healthy volunteers; the latter exceeded 545 to 3956 fold the H5N1 IC50 (0.69 ng/ml) isolated from the H5N1 infected female. Two patients with follow-up respiratory specimens cleared their viruses after 5 (H5N1 male) and 5 (H3N2 female) days of oseltamivir. Both female patients died of respiratory failure; the male survived. 150 mg bid of oseltamivir was well absorbed and converted extensively to OC. Virus was cleared in two patients but two patients died, suggesting viral efficacy but poor clinical efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2045803552,"Introduction Retail pharmaceutical products are commonly used to treat fever and malaria in sub-Saharan African countries. Small scale studies have suggested that poor quality antimalarials are widespread throughout the region, but nationwide data are not available that could lead to generalizable conclusions about the extent to which poor quality drugs are available in African communities. This study aimed to assess the quality of antimalarials available from retail outlets across mainland Tanzania. Methods and Findings We systematically purchased samples of oral antimalarial tablets from retail outlets across 21 districts in mainland Tanzania in 2005. A total of 1080 antimalarial formulations were collected including 679 antifol antimalarial samples (394 sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and 285 sulfamethoxypyrazine/pyrimethamine), 260 amodiaquine samples, 63 quinine samples, and 51 artemisinin derivative samples. A systematic subsample of 304 products was assessed for quality by laboratory based analysis to determine the amount of the active ingredient and dissolution profile by following the published United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) monogram for the particular tablet being tested. Products for which a published analytical monogram did not exist were assessed on amount of active ingredient alone. Overall 38 or 12.2% of the samples were found to be of poor quality. Of the antifolate antimalarial drugs tested 13.4% were found to be of poor quality by dissolution and content analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Nearly one quarter (23.8%) of quinine tablets did not comply within the tolerance limits of the dissolution and quantification analysis. Quality of amodiaquine drugs was relatively better but still unacceptable as 7.5% did not comply within the tolerance limits of the dissolution analysis. Formulations of the artemisinin derivatives all contained the stated amount of active ingredient when analysed using HPLC alone. Conclusions Substandard antimalarial formulations were widely available in Tanzania at the time of this study. No products were detected that did not contain any amount of the stated active ingredient. Quinine and sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine products were the most widely available and also the most likely to be of poor quality. Substandard products were identified in all parts of the country and were labeled as made by both domestic and international manufacturers. With the expansion of the retail pharmaceutical sector as a delivery channel for antimalarial formulations the need for regular nationwide monitoring of their quality will become increasingly important."
https://openalex.org/W1970448164,"Dimerization has emerged as an important feature of chemokine G-protein-coupled receptors. CXCR4 and CCR5 regulate leukocyte chemotaxis and also serve as a co-receptor for HIV entry. Both receptors are recruited to the immunological synapse during T-cell activation. However, it is not clear whether they form heterodimers and whether ligand binding modulates the dimer formation.Using a sensitive Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging method, we investigated the formation of CCR5 and CXCR4 heterodimers on the plasma membrane of live cells. We found that CCR5 and CXCR4 exist as constitutive heterodimers and ligands of CCR5 and CXCR4 promote different conformational changes within these preexisting heterodimers. Ligands of CCR5, in contrast to a ligand of CXCR4, induced a clear increase in FRET efficiency, indicating that selective ligands promote and stabilize a distinct conformation of the heterodimers. We also found that mutations at C-terminus of CCR5 reduced its ability to form heterodimers with CXCR4. In addition, ligands induce different conformational transitions of heterodimers of CXCR4 and CCR5 or CCR5(STA) and CCR5(Delta4).Taken together, our data suggest a model in which CXCR4 and CCR5 spontaneously form heterodimers and ligand-binding to CXCR4 or CCR5 causes different conformational changes affecting heterodimerization, indicating the complexity of regulation of dimerization/function of these chemokine receptors by ligand binding."

https://openalex.org/W2067042612,"FE65 is an adaptor protein that binds to and forms a transcriptionally active complex with the gamma-secretase-derived amyloid precursor protein (APP) intracellular domain. The regulatory mechanisms of FE65-APP-mediated transcription are still not clear. In this report, we demonstrate that Dexras1, a Ras family small G protein, binds to FE65 PTB2 domain and potently suppresses the FE65-APP-mediated transcription. The suppression is not via competition for binding of FE65 between Dexras1 and APP because the two proteins can simultaneously bind to the FE65 PTB2 domain. Phosphorylation of FE65 tyrosine 547 within the PTB2 domain has been shown to enhance FE65-APP-mediated transcription but not to influence binding to APP. Here we find that this phosphorylation event reduces the binding between Dexras1 and FE65. We also demonstrate that Dexras1 inhibits the FE65-APP-mediated transcription of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3 beta). Moreover, small interfering RNA knockdown of Dexras1 enhances GSK3 beta expression and increases phosphorylation of Tau, a GSK3 beta substrate. Thus, Dexras1 functions as a suppressor of FE65-APP-mediated transcription, and FE65 tyrosine 547 phosphorylation enhances FE65-APP-mediated transcription, at least in part, by modulating the interaction between FE65 and Dexras1. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism for FE65-APP-mediated signaling."

Although this process is generally accepted to require the activation of Bak or Bax, the underlying mechanism responsible for their activation during true intrinsic apoptosis is not well understood. In the current study, we investigated the molecular requirements necessary for Bak activation using distinct clones of Bax-deficient Jurkat T-lymphocytes in which the intrinsic pathway had been inhibited. Cells stably overexpressing Bcl-2/Bcl-xL or stably depleted of Apaf-1 were equally resistant to apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging anticancer drug etoposide as determined by phosphatidylserine externalization and caspase activation. Strikingly, characterization of mitochondrial apoptotic events in all three drug-resistant cell lines revealed that, without exception, resistance to apoptosis was associated with an absence of Bak activation, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. Furthermore, we found that etoposide-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial events were inhibited in cells stably overexpressing either full-length X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) or the BIR1/BIR2 domains of XIAP.

Apoptosis is a gene-regulated form of cell death that is critical for normal development and tissue homeostasis. Disruptions in the control of apoptosis can contribute to the onset of various pathological states including cancer, where avoidance of apoptosis confers a survival advantage to tumorigenic cells. Apoptosis is mediated by a family of cysteine proteases that cleave after aspartate residues (caspases) and can be activated by two distinct signaling pathways. The intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) pathway is activated by cytotoxic stressors, such as DNA damage, γ-radiation, growth factor withdrawal, and heat. Such stimuli are known to cause mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) 2The abbreviations used are:MOMPmitochondrial outer membrane permeabilizationSmacsecond mitochondria-derived activator of caspasePBSphosphate-buffered salineXIAPX-linked inhibitor of apoptosis proteinBIRbaculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeattBidtruncated BidBH3Bcl-2 homology 3FITCfluorescein isothiocyanateApaf-1apoptotic protease-activating factor-1DMSOdimethyl sulfoxide and stimulate the release of cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac, also known as DIABLO), and Omi (also known as HtrA2) into the cytosol, where they work together to activate the initiator procaspase-9 within the apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) apoptosome complex (1Li P.

Normally, these proteins exist as inactive monomers either in the cytosol (Bax) or associated with the mitochondria (Bak). Activation of Bax and Bak coincides with their homo-oligomerization, which is thought to occur by one of two mechanisms. One model argues for the existence of “sensitizer” Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only proteins, such as Noxa and Bad, that can displace “activator” BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bim, truncated Bid (tBid), and Puma, from a prosurvival protein, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, to activate Bak or Bax (6Kim H.

The second model indicates that BH3-only proteins bind and neutralize prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins that normally keep Bak or Bax inactive (7Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I.

A well characterized example of Bak or Bax activation being induced by a BH3-only protein is during receptor-mediated apoptosis in so-called type II cells. In this case, death receptor ligation activates caspase-8, which, in turn, cleaves the cytosolic BH3-only protein Bid to tBid (9Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

A similar emergent understanding of a mechanism responsible for the activation of Bak/Bax during true mitochondria-mediated apoptosis is currently lacking. In this regard, the aim of the current study was to investigate the signaling requirements for MOMP during intrinsic apoptosis, as well as to help define the elusive threshold a cell must cross in order to be irreversibly committed to undergo this form of cell death. We have engineered several clones of Bax-deficient Jurkat cells in which the intrinsic pathway is inhibited due to the stable overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, the stable knockdown of Apaf-1, or the overexpression of full-length XIAP or the baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis protein repeat 1 and 2 (BIR1/BIR2) domains of XIAP. The results indicated that all five of the gene-manipulated Jurkat cell lines were similarly resistant to etoposide-induced apoptosis. As anticipated, Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells were refractory to all etoposide-induced mitochondrial events. Strikingly, however, Apaf-1-silenced cells and cells overexpressing full-length XIAP or the BIR1/BIR2 domains of XIAP were also found to be impaired in their ability to activate Bak, release cytochrome c, or lose mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ) in response to etoposide. Cell Culture—Wild-type Jurkat T-lymphocytes (clone E6.1) were cultured in RPMI 1640 complete medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10! (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2! (w/v) glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified 5! CO2 incubator. For transfected Jurkat cells, 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) was substituted for penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were maintained in an exponential growth phase for all experiments. All cells were replated in fresh complete non-selective medium prior to apoptosis induction. Apoptosis was induced with etoposide (10 μm; Sigma). Transfections—Wild-type Jurkat T-lymphocytes (107) were transfected with 20 μg of plasmid DNA (pSFFV-Bcl-2, pSFFV-Bcl-xL, pSFFV-neo, pSUPER-Apaf-1, pSUPER-neo, pcDNA3-XIAP, pcDNA3-XIAP-BIR1/BIR2, or pcDNA3-neo) by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell system (0.4-cm cuvette, 300 V and 950 microfarads). Cells were allowed to recover in RPMI 1640 complete medium for 48 h at 37 °C in a humidified 5! CO2 incubator. Selection of transfected cells was performed in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin for several weeks, at which time serial dilutions were performed to obtain single-cell clones of Bcl-2- and Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells, Apaf-1-silenced cells, and cells overexpressing full-length XIAP or the BIR1/BIR2 domains of XIAP. Flow Cytometry for Cell Death and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (ΔΨ) Measurements—Phosphatidylserine exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was detected using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) Apoptosis Detection Kit II (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 106 cells were pelleted following etoposide treatment and washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, the cells were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer containing annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. Prior to flow cytometric analysis, 400 μl of binding buffer were added to the cells. For ΔΨ determination, the MitoProbe DiIC1(5) Kit (Invitrogen) was used. Briefly, cells (106) were pelleted following drug treatment, washed once in PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of warm PBS. Next, 5 μl of 10 μm DiIC1(5) were added to the cells and incubated in a humidified 5! CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 15 min. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Western Blotting—Pelleted cells (5 × 106) were resuspended and lysed in 200 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1! Nonidet P-40) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini EDTA-Free, Roche Applied Science). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) and equal amounts were mixed with Laemmli. Western blot analysis was carried out as described previously (11Robertson J.D. Enoksson M. Suomela M. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. J. Biol.

The antibodies used were mouse anti-Apaf-1 (clone 94408, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), rabbit anti-Bax (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), rabbit anti-Bak NT (Millipore), mouse anti-Bcl-2 (DakoCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark), rabbit anti-Bcl-xL (clone 54H6, Cell Signaling), mouse anti-β-actin (clone AC-15, Sigma), rabbit anti-Bid (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-3 (clone 8G10, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-6 (Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-7 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-caspase-8 (clone 1C12, Cell Signaling), rabbit anti-caspase-9 (Cell Signaling), mouse anti-cytochrome c (clone 7H8.2C12, Pharmingen), rabbit anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD), mouse anti-Myc (clone 9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Smac/DIABLO (Cell Signaling), and mouse anti-XIAP (clone 28, BD Transduction Laboratories). Subcellular Fractionation—Cells (106) were washed in PBS, resuspended in 50 μl of buffer (140 mm mannitol, 46 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete Mini-EDTA Free), and permeabilized with 3 μg of digitonin (Sigma) on ice for 10 min. Plasma membrane permeabilization was monitored by trypan blue staining, and cell suspensions were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis. Determination of Bak Oligomerization and Activation—For detection of Bak oligomerization, cells (106) were harvested, washed and resuspended in 80 μl of 100 mm EDTA/PBS, incubated with the cross-linking agent bismaleimidohexane (1 mm) for 30 min at room temperature (22 °C), quenched with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 15 min, pelleted, and processed for Western blotting. For detection of activated Bak by flow cytometry, cells (106) were washed in PBS, fixed in 400 μl of 0.25! paraformaldehyde for 5 min, subsequently washed two times with 1! fetal bovine serum in PBS, and incubated in 50 μl of staining buffer (1! fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/ml digitonin in PBS) with a conformation-specific mouse monoclonal antibody against Bak (1:30; AM03, Calbiochem) for 30 min at room temperature (22 °C). Then, cells were washed and resuspended in 50 μlof staining buffer containing 0.25 μg of Alexa Fluor 488-labeled chicken anti-mouse antibody for 30 min in the dark. Cells were washed again and analyzed by flow cytometry. Analysis and histogram overlays were performed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). Blockade of the Intrinsic Pathway by Depleting Apaf-1 or Overexpressing Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Completely Inhibits Etoposide-induced Apoptosis in Jurkat Cells—The largest body of evidence indicates that MOMP and the release of intermembrane space proteins, such as cytochrome c, involves the activation of multidomain pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins Bak and Bax (2Chipuk J.E.

Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 532-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that active caspase-8 within the extrinsic apoptotic pathway can activate Bak or Bax by cleaving the BH3-only protein Bid to tBid (9Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1423-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar), a similar prominent role for one or more caspases in modulating MOMP during true intrinsic apoptosis is not appreciated. In some instances, incubation of cells with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide was found to induce caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid by stimulating an up-regulation of Fas ligand that, in turn, activated the Fas receptor (13Friesen C.

Robertson, unpublished results. , have shown that caspase-8-deficient cells are sensitive to etoposide-induced apoptosis (16Juo P. Kuo C.J. Yuan J. Blenis J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1001-1008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Other evidence has suggested that caspase-2 may be able to activate Bax by first cleaving Bid in response to stress (17Gogvadze V. Orrenius S. Zhivotovsky B. Biochim. Biophys.

Newmeyer D.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2150-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently demonstrated that Apaf-1 is required for etoposide-induced activation of all caspases, suggesting that most, if not all, caspase activation occurs downstream of apoptosome formation (21Franklin E.E. Robertson J.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To investigate the molecular requirements for etoposide-induced MOMP, we initially used the same Apaf-1-deficient Jurkat cells described previously (Fig. 1A, lane 5) (21Franklin E.E. Robertson J.D. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), as well as cells in which the intrinsic pathway had been inhibited due to the overexpression of either Bcl-xL or Bcl-2 (lanes 2 and 3). As illustrated in Fig. 1A, manipulating the level of expression of Apaf-1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL did not result in any alteration in the expression of the other two proteins. According to Fig. 1B, control-transfected Jurkat cells were induced to undergo apoptosis (∼30!), as determined by annexin V-FITC labeling of externalized phosphatidylserine on the plasma membrane, when incubated in the presence of a clinically relevant concentration of etoposide (10 μm) for 6 h. By comparison, Jurkat cells in which either Apaf-1 expression had been silenced or an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein had been overexpressed were totally protected from etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1B). In agreement with these findings, Western blot analysis of cell lysates obtained at 6 h post-etoposide treatment revealed that proteolytic processing of procaspase-8, -9, and -3 occurred in wild-type and control-transfected cells, but not in any of the three gene-manipulated clones (Fig. 1C). In addition, cleavage of Bid to tBid was observed only in etoposide-treated wild type and vector control cells, suggesting that Bid cleavage occurs downstream of the apoptosome. Taken together, these data clearly demonstrate that silencing Apaf-1 or overexpressing Bcl-2/Bcl-xL results in a total blockade of the intrinsic pathway in Jurkat cells. Bak Activation Is Impaired in Apaf-1-deficient Cells Treated with Etoposide—In many settings, cytochrome c release is a rapid, complete, and irreversible event that represents the “point of no return” within the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (22Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). In addition, it is generally accepted that caspase-9 activation requires cytochrome c-mediated oligomerization of Apaf-1 and that cytochrome c release occurs independently of downstream caspase activity (1Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar, 23Bossy-Wetzel E. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar, 24Sun X.M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5053-5060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). In this regard, cells deficient in Apaf-1, caspase-9, or executioner caspases-3 and -7 would be expected to undergo MOMP and release intermembrane space proteins with the same kinetics as wild-type cells. However, some evidence is at odds with such a view of the intrinsic pathway. For instance, it has been shown that procaspases can be activated by a cytochrome c- and apoptosome-independent, but Apaf-1-dependent, mechanism in thymocytes exposed to γ-radiation (25Hao Z. Duncan G.S. Chang C.C. Elia A. Fang M. Wakeham A. Okada H. Calzascia T. Jang Y. You-Ten A. Yeh W.C. Ohashi P. Wang X. Mak T.W. Cell. 2005; 121: 579-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Also, Lakhani et al. (26Lakhani S.A. Masud A. Kuida K. Porter Jr., G.A. Booth C.J. Mehal W.Z. Inayat I. Flavell R.A. Science. 2006; 311: 847-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar) demonstrated that caspase-3 and -7 are key mediators of Bax-directed mitochondrial apoptotic events in response to ultraviolet radiation. Having demonstrated that Jurkat cells in which either an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein had been overexpressed or Apaf-1 had been knocked down, were equally impaired in their ability to activate caspases, we next evaluated the different cells for changes in Δψ. As illustrated in Fig. 2A, a partial loss of Δψ in response to 10 μm etoposide was detected in control-transfected Jurkat cells, which activated caspases (Fig. 1C), whereas Apaf-1-deficient and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells did not lose Δψ. These data are consistent with evidence indicating that the loss of Δψ during apoptotic cell death requires caspase-mediated proteolytic inactivation of the respiratory complex I subunit NDUSF1 (27Ricci J.E. Munoz-Pinedo C. Fitzgerald P. Bailly-Maitre B. Perkins G.A. Yadava N. Scheffler I.E. Ellisman M.H. Green D.R. Cell. 2004; 117: 773-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Because a drop in Δψ is often associated with the release of mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins into the cytosol, we next investigated whether the release of cytochrome c and Smac had occurred in the different cell types. Consistent with the membrane potential results, etoposide treatment stimulated a strong release of cytochrome c and Smac only in vector control cells (Fig. 2B, lane 6 versus 5). By comparison, cells overexpressing either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL failed to release cytochrome c or Smac in response to etoposide (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–4), and Apaf-1-deficient cells released only a trace of each protein (lane 8 versus 7). Numerous studies from other laboratories have shown that the induction of MOMP is tightly controlled by pro- and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins (2Chipuk J.E. Bouchier-Hayes L. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1396-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 28Scorrano L. Korsmeyer S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 437-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). In fact, it is often the ratio of pro- to anti-apoptotic proteins that determines the sensitivity of a cell to a given intrinsic apoptotic stimulus. Induction of MOMP by either of the multidomain pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bak is thought to require the prior activation of a BH3-only Bcl-2 family protein (29Letai A.G. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevent MOMP by directly binding Bax/Bak or by preventing their activation by inhibiting BH3-only proteins (30Youle R.J. Strasser A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (3607) Google Scholar). As mentioned earlier, Bax is largely cytosolic in healthy cells, whereas Bak resides on the outer mitochondrial membrane. Both proteins are monomeric in their inactive state, and activation coincides with their homo-oligomerization to form protein-permeable pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. To investigate the extent to which differences in the release of cytochrome c and Smac corresponded to differences in the activation of Bax or Bak, we first evaluated the different cell clones for the expression of Bax and Bak. Interestingly, Western blot results revealed that Jurkat (E6.1) cells express Bak, but not Bax, protein (Fig. 2C, lane 1). Thus, to evaluate changes in Bak under the different conditions, we first investigated whether Bak underwent oligomerization using the cross-linking agent bismaleimidohexane. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, cross-linked Bak complexes consistent with dimers were observed in wild-type (lane 2) and control-transfected (lane 8) Jurkat cells treated with 10 μm etoposide for 6 h. These findings were in agreement with results obtained using an active conformation-specific monoclonal Bak antibody and flow cytometric analysis, where Bak activation amounts to a shift to the right in the resulting histogram (Fig. 2E). Consistent with previous reports, etoposide-induced oligomerization (Fig. 2D) and activation (Fig. 2E) of Bak were blocked in cells overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL, perhaps because of their reported ability to sequester activator BH3-only proteins (6Kim H. Rafiuddin-Shah M. Tu H.C. Jeffers J.R. Zambetti G.P. Hsieh J.J. Cheng E.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1348-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar) or to bind Bak directly (7Chen L. Willis S.N. Wei A. Smith B.J. Fletcher J.I. Hinds M.G. Colman P.M. Day C.L. Adams J.M. Huang D.C. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1533) Google Scholar, 8Willis S.N.

Science. 2007; 315: 856-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). Significantly, Bak oligomerization and activation were also strongly inhibited in Apaf-1-deficient Jurkat cells (Fig. 2D, lane 10 versus 9, and E), which likely accounts for the lack of cytochrome c and Smac release in these cells following etoposide treatment (Fig. 2B, lane 8 versus 7). Combined, these data raise the distinct possibility that signaling events, which are widely believed to be post-mitochondrial, are essential for Bak-mediated cytochrome c release and dissipation of Δψ during true intrinsic apoptotic cell death. Overexpression of Full-length XIAP or the BIR1/BIR2 Domains of XIAP Inhibits Etoposide-induced Apoptosis—Because Bak activation and MOMP were strongly inhibited in Apaf-1-deficient cells, we were next interested to determine whether this was due to a direct role of Apaf-1 in mediating MOMP or whether the absence of Bak activation and the release of intermembrane space proteins were attributable to the lack of etoposide-induced caspase activation. Because of the reported problems with the selectivity of “specific” peptide-based caspase inhibitors (31Berger A.B. Sexton K.B. Bogyo M. Cell Res. 2006; 16: 961-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 32McStay G.P. Salvesen G.S. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2008; 15: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), we developed a genetic strategy to inhibit caspases residing downstream of apoptosome formation. The approach was to modulate the expression of XIAP. XIAP is a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family that potently inhibits apoptotic cell death by specifically targeting caspase-9, -3, and/or -7 (33Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Recent work has described the regions of XIAP that are responsible for its caspase inhibitory properties (34Scott F.L. Denault J.B. Riedl S.J. Shin H. Renatus M. Salvesen G.S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 35Shiozaki E.N. Chai J. Rigotti D.J. Riedl S.J. Li P. Srinivasula S.M. Alnemri E.S. Fairman R. Shi Y. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Specifically, a region of XIAP that includes the BIR2 domain inhibits caspase-3 and -7, whereas the BIR3 domain inhibits caspase-9. In a cell dying by apoptosis, the anti-apoptotic activity of XIAP can be inhibited by two mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins, namely Smac (36Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

https://openalex.org/W2077447247,"The development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and Huntington disease is strongly age-dependent. Discovering drugs that act on the high rate of aging in older individuals could be a means of combating these diseases. Reduction of the activity of the mitochondrial enzyme CLK-1 (also known as COQ7) slows down aging in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mice. Clioquinol is a metal chelator that has beneficial effects in several cellular and animal models of neurodegenerative diseases as well as on Alzheimer disease patients. Here we show that clioquinol inhibits the activity of mammalian CLK-1 in cultured cells, an inhibition that can be blocked by iron or cobalt cations, suggesting that chelation is involved in the mechanism of action of clioquinol on CLK-1. We also show that treatment of nematodes and mice with clioquinol mimics a variety of phenotypes produced by mutational reduction of CLK-1 activity in these organisms. These results suggest that the surprising action of clioquinol on several age-dependent neurodegenerative diseases with distinct etiologies might result from a slowing down of the aging process through action of the drug on CLK-1. Our findings support the hypothesis that pharmacologically targeting aging-associated proteins could help relieve age-dependent diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1970281468,"Transcription control at a distance is a critical mechanism, particularly for contiguous genes. The peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs) catalyse the conversion of protein-bound arginine into citrulline (deimination), a critical reaction in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, and in the metabolism of the major epidermal barrier protein filaggrin, a strong predisposing factor for atopic dermatitis. PADs are encoded by 5 clustered PADI genes (1p35-6). Unclear are the mechanisms controlling the expression of the gene PADI3 encoding the PAD3 isoform, a strong candidate for the deimination of filaggrin in the terminally differentiating epidermal keratinocyte. We describe the first PAD Intergenic Enhancer (PIE), an evolutionary conserved non coding segment located 86-kb from the PADI3 promoter. PIE is a strong enhancer of the PADI3 promoter in Ca2+-differentiated epidermal keratinocytes, and requires bound AP-1 factors, namely c-Jun and c-Fos. As compared to proliferative keratinocytes, calcium stimulation specifically associates with increased local DNase I hypersensitivity around PIE, and increased physical proximity of PIE and PADI3 as assessed by Chromosome Conformation Capture. The specific AP-1 inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid suppresses the calcium-induced increase of PADI3 mRNA levels in keratinocytes. Our findings pave the way to the exploration of deimination control during tumorigenesis and wound healing, two conditions for which AP-1 factors are critical, and disclose that long-range transcription control has a role in the regulation of the gene PADI3. Since invalidation of distant regulators causes a variety of human diseases, PIE results to be a plausible candidate in association studies on deimination-related disorders or atopic disease."

The fact that IGF-I null mice have a reduced growth plate height clearly suggests a facilitatory role for IGF-I on growth plate chondrogenesis and, in turn, on longitudinal bone growth.

To test our hypothesis, we first cultured whole rat metatarsal bones in the presence of IGF-I and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC, a known NF-κB inhibitor) to study their effects on metatarsal longitudinal growth and growth plate chondrogenesis. Second, we analyzed the effects of IGF-I on the nuclear translocation of NF-κB in growth plate chondrocytes, and the effects of IGF-I, PDTC, and NF-κB p65 siRNA on cultured growth plate chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Finally, we evaluated the effects of the selective inhibition of the IGF-I receptor-activated intracellular signaling pathways on the IGF-I-mediated induction of NF-κB activity. Whole Metatarsal Culture—The second, third, and fourth metatarsal bone rudiments were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses at 20 days postconception and cultured individually in 24-well plates (19Bagi C. Burger E.H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Wu S. De Luca F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4642-4647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Each well contained 0.5 ml of minimum essential medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 0.05 mg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 1 mm sodium glycerophosphate (Sigma), 0.2% bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Bone rudiments were cultured for 3 days in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The medium was changed on day 2. During the 3-day culture period, metatarsals were cultured in the absence or presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-I, with or without 1 μm pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) (Sigma), a specific NF-κB inhibitor. Animal care was in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (DHEW Publication (NIH) 85-23, revised 1996). Chondrocyte Culture—Metatarsal rudiments isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat fetuses at 20 days postconception were rinsed in PBS, incubated in 0.2% trypsin for 1 h, and then 0.2% collagenase for 3 h. Cell suspension was aspirated repeatedly and filtered through a 70-μm cell strainer, rinsed first in PBS and then in serum-free DMEM, and counted. Chondrocytes were seeded in 100-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104/cm2 in DMEM with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The culture medium was changed at 72-h intervals. Once 70–80% confluence was reached, cells were washed with serum-free medium and treated with 100 ng/ml IGF-I and/or 1 μm PDTC and/or graded concentrations of selective protein kinase inhibitors (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ). Measurement of Metatarsal Longitudinal Growth—The length of each bone rudiment was measured under a dissecting microscope, using an eyepiece micrometer. The eyepiece micrometer was calibrated every day by using a 1-mm stage micrometer. To calculate the metatarsal growth rate, bone length was measured at the beginning and at the end of the 3-day culture period using an eyepiece micrometer in a dissecting microscope. For each treatment group, 48–53 metatarsal bones isolated from 15 to 18 rat fetuses were used. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. Quantitative Histology—At the end of the culture period, metatarsals were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde overnight. After routine processing, 3 longitudinal, 5–7-μm-thick sections were obtained from each metatarsal bone and stained with toluidine blue. From each of the three sections, we measured the height of the epiphyseal zone, proliferative zone, and the hypertrophic zone, and we calculated the average value. In the metatarsal growth plate, the epiphyseal zone is characterized by small and rounded cells, irregularly arranged in the cartilage matrix. The proliferative zone includes cells with a flattened shape, arranged in columns parallel to the longitudinal axis of the bone. In the hypertrophic zone, large cells (defined by a height ≥9 μm) form a layer adjacent to the calcified region of the metatarsal bone, the primary ossification center. For each treatment group, 7–9 metatarsal bones (=21–27 sections/group) isolated from 3 to 4 rat fetuses were used. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. All quantitative histology was performed by a single observer blinded to the treatment category. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation—To assess cell proliferation in the metatarsal growth plate, we measured [3H]thymidine in situ incorporation (19Bagi C. Burger E.H. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1989; 45: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). After 3 days of culture, [3H]thymidine was added to the culture medium of the rat metatarsal bones at a concentration of 5 μCi/ml (25 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences). Bone rudiments were incubated for an additional 5 h. At the end of the incubation, all bones were fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut in 5–7 μm-thick longitudinal sections. Autoradiography was performed by dipping the slides in Hypercoat emulsion, exposing them for 4 weeks, and then developing them with a Kodak-D19 developer. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. For each treatment group, five metatarsal bones isolated from three rat fetuses were sampled, and three sections of each bone (with each section containing both metatarsal growth plates) were analyzed (=15 sections/group). The labeling index was calculated as the number of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells per grid divided by the total number of cells per grid. The grid circumscribed a portion of the growth plate zone as viewed through a ×40 objective and generally contained an average of 50 cells. In each bone section, the labeling index was calculated in three distinct grid locations and then averaged separately in the epiphyseal and in the proliferative zones. All determinations were made by the same observer blinded to the treatment category. To assess proliferation in cultured chondrocytes, 2.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the culture medium for an additional 3 h at the end of the culture period. Cells were then washed, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and lysed in 0.5 m NaOH, 0.5% SDS. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine was measured by liquid scintillation counting and normalized by protein content. RT-PCR—At the end of the culture period, total RNA was extracted from the growth plates of whole rat metatarsal bones or from cultured chondrocytes using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). The following specific primers were used: rat collagen X (5′ primer, 5′-ATATCCTGGGGATCCAGGTC-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-tggg-tcacccttagatccag-3′; product size 241 bp) (AJ131848), and rat NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz CA, catalog number sc-61876-PR). The housekeeping gene β-actin (5′ primer, 5′-CTGACAGACTACCTCATGAAGATCC-3′;3′ primer, 5′-CATAGAGGTCTTTACGGATGTCAAC-3′; product size 330 bp) (NM_031144) was used as normalization control. The recovered RNA was further processed using First Strand cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR (avian myeloblastosis virus) (Roche Diagnostics) to produce cDNA. One microgram of total RNA and 1.6 μg of p(dT)15 primer were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, followed by incubation for 60 min at 42 °C in the presence of 20 units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and 50 units of RNase inhibitor in a total 20-μl reaction. The cDNA products were directly used for PCR or stored at -80 °C for later analysis. The reaction (100 μl total volume) was performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the presence of 20 pmol of primers, 20 nmol of dNTP, 150 nmol of MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer (Expand High Fidelity PCR buffer; Roche Applied Science), and 2.5 units Expand High Fidelity DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Science). The conditions for amplification were 2 min and 30 s at 96 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation for 45 s at 96 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, elongation for 1 min 30 s at 72 °C, and finally extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel with ethidium bromide (1.5 μg/ml). p65 siRNA Transfection—Chondrocytes were transfected with an siRNA targeted for rat NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-61876) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). An siRNA consisting of a scrambled sequence of similar length was similarly transfected as control siRNA. One day before transfection, cells were plated in 500 μl of growth medium without antibiotics such that they were 30–50% confluent at the time of transfection. The transfected cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum for 72 h after transfection. To determine transfection efficiency, we transfected chondrocytes with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalog number sc-36869) in two separate experiments. Transfection efficiency was 45.0 ± 2.4% (range of 30.8–51.4%). To determine whether p65 siRNA specifically silenced NF-κB p65 expression, we evaluated NF-κB p65 mRNA and protein expression in transfected chondrocytes by RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. In Situ Cell Death—Chondrocytes were treated for 24 h with 1 mm sodium nitroprusside (SNP, Sigma), a known inducer of apoptosis (21Cheng Y.G. Chang H.C. Lin Y.L. Kuo M.L. Chiu W.T. Chen R.M. J. Orthop. Res. 2008; 26: 1018-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 22Wu G.J. Chen T.G. Chang H.C. Chiu H.C. Chang C.C. Chen R.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 2007; 101: 1520-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), in the presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-I and/or 1 μm PDTC. At the end of the culture period, cultured chondrocytes were washed with PBS three times and fixed in -10 °C methanol for 5 min, and then air-dried. Apoptotic cells were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling, according to the manufacturer's instructions (TdT-FragEL kit; Oncogene Research Products, Boston). A positive control was generated by adding 1 μg/μl DNase I in 1× TBS, 1 mm MgSO4 following proteinase K treatment, whereas a negative control was generated by substituting distilled H2O for the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase in the reaction mixture. All other steps were performed as described above (data not shown). In situ cell death was quantitated by determining the apoptotic index. The apoptotic index was calculated as the number of apoptotic cells per grid divided by the total number of cells per grid. The grid circumscribed cultured chondrocytes analyzed through a ×40 objective, and generally contained an average of 30 cells. For each treatment group, the apoptotic index was calculated in five distinct grid locations. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. Indices were calculated by a single observer blinded to the treatment regimen. Caspase-3 Assay—Cytosolic caspase-3 activity was determined in a medium containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm Na-EDTA, 20% glycerol, 500 μg of cytosolic protein, and 75 μm of a synthetic fluorogenic substrate containing the recognition sequence for caspase-3 (Ac-DEVD-AMC) (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). The caspase activity was measured spectrofluorometrically at 460 nm using 380 nm excitation wavelength at 37 °C for 150 s. The relative level of caspase-3 activity was expressed as nanomoles per mg of protein per hour. NF-κB p65 DNA Binding Activity—NF-κB p65 DNA binding activity was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor MN, catalog number 10007889), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a specific double-stranded DNA sequence containing the NF-κB response element was immobilized onto the bottom of wells of a 96-well plate. NF-κB p65 contained in the nuclear extract was detected by addition of a specific primary antibody directed against NF-κB p65. A secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added to provide a sensitive colorimetric readout at 450 nm. Nuclei were extracted from chondrocytes treated for 24 h with 100 ng/ml IGF-I, and/or 1 μm PDTC, and/or the following specific protein kinase inhibitors (23Bain J. Plater L. Elliott M. Shpiro N.

J. 2007; 408: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (2103) Google Scholar) wortmannin (PI3K inhibitor); U0126 (MAPK inhibitor); Akti 1/2 (Akt inhibitor); bisindolylmaleimide I (PKC inhibitor); H-89 (PKA inhibitor). All these inhibitors were purchased from EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of optical density per μg of protein and represent three separate experiments. Statistics—All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined by t test or by analysis of variance. Effects of IGF-I and PDTC on Metatarsal Longitudinal Growth and Growth Plate Chondrogenesis—During the 3 days of the culture period, 100 ng/ml IGF-I significantly stimulated metatarsal longitudinal growth (n = 48–53 bones/group; Table 1), whereas co-treatment of IGF-I and 1 μm PDTC reversed this stimulatory effect. Because the rate of longitudinal bone growth depends primarily on the rate of growth plate chondrogenesis, we evaluated the effects of IGF-I on chondrocyte proliferation and chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation. To determine the site of the growth plate in which chondrocyte proliferation occurred, we examined the in situ [3H]thymidine incorporation into the metatarsal rudiments at the end of the culture period. IGF-I significantly increased [3H]thymidine incorporation into the growth plate epiphyseal and proliferative zones (representative sections of control and IGF-I-treated bones, see Fig. 1, A and B; labeling index, n = 15 sections/group, see Table 1), whereas co-treatment with PDTC reversed the IGF-I stimulatory effects (representative section, Fig. 1D; labeling index, n = 15 sections/group, Table 1). Treatment with PDTC alone did not elicit any change in the in situ [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with control bones (representative section of PDTC-treated bones, Fig. 1C; labeling index, n = 15 sections/group, Table 1). Consistent with its effects on [3H]thymidine incorporation, IGF-I increased the height of the growth plate epiphyseal and proliferative zones (n = 21–27 sections/group, Table 1), the zones of the growth plate where cell proliferation takes place. Treatment with IGF-I also increased the height of the growth plate hypertrophic zone (n = 21–27 sections/group, Table 1) and induced the mRNA expression of collagen X in the growth plate (Fig. 1E), reflecting a stimulatory role for IGF-I on growth plate chondrocyte hypertrophy/differentiation.TABLE 1Effects of IGF-I and PDTC on metatarsal longitudinal growth and growth plate chondrogenesis The following abbreviations are used: EZ, epiphyseal zone; PZ, proliferative zone; HZ, hypertrophic zone.Cumulative growth (μm) (48–53 bones/group)Zone height (μm) (21–27 sections/group)Labeling index (%) (15 sections/group)EZPZHZEZPZControl264.6 ± 14.9607.1 ± 10.4118.5 ± 7.085.1 ± 6.115.6 ± 1.18.1 ± 0.4IGF-I363.5 ± 18.0ap was <0.01 versus control696.4 ± 30.2bp was <0.05 versus control151.5 ± 7.8bp was <0.05 versus control103.8 ± 2.8bp was <0.05 versus control23.9 ± 0.7ap was <0.01 versus control13.4 ± 1.2ap was <0.01 versus controlPDTC233.3 ± 14.4603.9 ± 8.6120.0 ± 4.189.0 ± 1.315.9 ± 2.77.8 ± 1.7IGF-I + PDTC286.9 ± 15.6cp was <0.01 versus IGF-I694.6 ± 46.5bp was <0.05 versus control120.2 ± 6.3dp was <0.05 versus IGF-I85.3 ± 3.6cp was <0.01 versus IGF-I17.7 ± 1.5cp was <0.01 versus IGF-I8.8 ± 1.5dp was <0.05 versus IGF-Ia p was <0.01 versus controlb p was <0.05 versus controlc p was <0.01 versus IGF-Id p was <0.05 versus IGF-I Open table in a new tab Effects of IGF-I, PDTC, and p65 siRNA on Chondrocyte Proliferation, Differentiation, and Apoptosis— To determine whether IGF-I functionally interacts with NF-κB p65 in chondrocytes, we first transfected chondrocytes isolated from fetal rat metatarsal growth plates with a rat NF-κB p65 siRNA or a control siRNA. p65 siRNA-transfected chondrocytes exhibited reduced p65 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively) compared with control siRNA-transfected chondrocytes. To confirm the findings observed in the whole metatarsal bones, we evaluated the effects of IGF-I on transfected growth plate chondrocyte proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. In chondrocytes isolated from metatarsal growth plates and transfected with control siRNA, 100 ng/ml IGF-I induced chondrocyte proliferation (assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation; IGF-I versus control, Fig. 2C) as well as differentiation (assessed by collagen X mRNA expression, Fig. 2D). The co-treatment of IGF-I with 1 μm PDTC reversed these stimulatory effects (IGF-I + PDTC versus IGF-I, Fig. 2, C and D). The transfection of cultured chondrocytes with NF-κB p65 siRNA reduced [3H]thymidine incorporation compared with control siRNA-transfected chondrocytes (p65 siRNA versus control, Fig. 2C), with such effect being reversed by 100 ng/ml IGF-I (IGF-I + p65 siRNA versus p65 siRNA, Fig. 2C). The addition of IGF-I in the culture medium of p65 siRNA-transfected chondrocytes did not modify collagen X expression (IGF-I + p65 siRNA versus p65 siRNA, Fig. 2D). In light of the regulatory role of IGF-I and NF-κB on apoptosis in other cell types, we evaluated the effects of IGF-I, PDTC, and p65 siRNA on chondrocyte apoptosis by assessing in situ cell death and caspase-3 activity. Chondrocytes cultured with 1 mm SNP exhibited increased cell death (representative photographs, Fig. 3B, and apoptotic index, Fig. 3G) and caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3H) when compared with control chondrocytes. The addition of 100 ng/ml IGF-I to the culture medium of the SNP-treated chondrocytes prevented the SNP-mediated increase of cell death (representative photograph, Fig. 3C, and apoptotic index, Fig. 3G) and caspase-3 activity (Fig. 3H). However, co-treatment of 1 μm PDTC + 100 ng/ml IGF-I reversed the anti-apoptotic effects of IGF-I on the SNP-induced cell death and caspase-3 activity (representative photograph, Fig. 3D; apoptotic index, Fig. 3G, and caspase-3 activity, Fig. 3H). Effects of IGF-I on NF-κB p65-DNA Binding—To determine whether IGF-1 specifically induces NF-κB p65 activation, we evaluated the NF-κB-DNA binding activity by using an NF-κB p65 transcription factor enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. IGF-I significantly increased the NF-κB p65-DNA binding activity in control-siRNA-transfected cells (Table 2), whereas co-treatment of 1 μm PDTC and IGF-I reversed such stimulatory effect of IGF-I (Table 2). PDTC alone did not modify the NF-κB p65-DNA binding activity. As shown by us previously (11Wu S. Flint J. Rezvani G. De Luca F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 33698-33706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), p65 siRNA-transfected cells exhibited decreased NF-κB p65-DNA binding activity when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells (Table 2). However, the addition of 100 ng/ml IGF-I to the culture medium fully normalized the NF-κB p65-DNA binding activity (Table 2).TABLE 2Effects of IGF-I, PDTC, and p65 siRNA on NF-κB-DNA binding activityA450/μg proteinControl siRNA0.098 ± 0.007IGF-I + control siRNA0.248 ± 0.025ap was <0.05 versus controlPDTC + control siRNA0.11 ± 0.009p65 siRNA0.061 ± 0.001ap was <0.05 versus controlIGF-I + PDTC + control siRNA0.120 ± 0.007bp was <0.05 versus IGF-IIGF-I + p65 siRNA0.111 ± 0.005cp was <0.05 versus p65 siRNAa p was <0.05 versus controlb p was <0.05 versus IGF-Ic p was <0.05 versus p65 siRNA Open table in a new tab To determine which intracellular signaling pathway(s) mediates the effects of IGF-I on NF-κB p65 activity, we cultured chondrocytes in the presence of 100 ng/ml IGF-I, with or without specific inhibitors of each of the signaling pathways activated by IGF-I. The addition of 10 μm wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) or 10 μm Akti 1/2 (an Akt inhibitor) to the culture medium of IGF-I-treated chondrocytes significantly reversed the stimulatory effects of IGF-I on NF-κB p65 DNA binding activity (Table 3 and Fig. 4, A and B). In contrast, the addition of U0126 (a MAPK inhibitor), H-89 (a PKA inhibitor), or bisindolylmaleimide I (a PKC inhibitor) did not modify the IGF-I-mediated increase of NF-κB p65 activity (Fig. 4, C–E). In the absence of IGF-I in the culture medium, none of the above inhibitors had any effect on the NF-κB p65-DNA binding activity in chondrocytes (Fig. 4).TABLE 3Effects of PI3K and Akt inhibitors on the IGF-I-mediated induction of NF-κB-DNA binding activityA450/μg proteinControl0.09 ± 0.006IGF-I0.273 ± 0.009ap was <0.05 versus controlIGF-I + 10 μm wortmannin0.130 ± 0.01bp was <0.05 versus IGF-IIGF-I + 10 m Akti 1/20.137 ± 0.002bp was <0.05 versus IGF-Ia p was <0.05 versus controlb p was <0.05 versus IGF-I Open table in a new tab In mammals, the rate of longitudinal bone growth depends primarily on the rate of growth plate chondrogenesis. Growth plate chondrocyte proliferation, hypertrophy/differentiation, and extracellular matrix secretion lead to the formation of new cartilage, chondrogenesis (24Farnum C.E. Wilsman N.J. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1987; 28: 505-519Google Scholar). Simultaneously, while the terminally differentiated chondrocytes die by apoptosis, the growth plate is invaded from the metaphysis by blood vessels and bone cell precursors, which remodel the cartilage into bone tissue (25Aharinejad S. Marks S.C. Bock P. Mackay C.A. Larson E.K. Tahamtani A. Mason-Savas A. Firbas W. Anat. Rec. 1995; 242: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The net result of these two well coordinated processes, chondrogenesis and ossification, is long bone elongation. Growth plate chondrogenesis is regulated by a network of endocrine and paracrine factors, which modulate the chondrocyte function via several intracellular transcription factors. Our study demonstrates that IGF-I stimulates metatarsa"

The objective of this study was to compare whole blood IFN-gamma production in response to mycobacterial antigens between children and adults in Uganda.We studied household contacts of persons with culture-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) enrolled in a cohort study conducted in Kampala, Uganda. Whole blood IFN-gamma production in response to Mtb culture-filtrate antigens was measured by ELISA and compared between infants (<2 years old, n = 80), young children (2 <5 years old, n = 216), older children (5 <15 years old, n = 443) and adults (> or =15 years old, n = 528). We evaluated the relationship between IFN-gamma responses and the tuberculin skin test (TST), and between IFN-gamma responses and epidemiologic factors that reflect exposure to Mtb, and the effect of prior BCG vaccination on IFN-gamma responses. Young household contacts demonstrated robust IFN-gamma responses comparable to those of adults that were associated with TST and known risk factors for infection. There was no effect of prior BCG immunization on the IFN-gamma response.Young children in a TB endemic setting can mount robust IFN-gamma responses generally comparable to those of adults, and as in adults, these responses correlated with the TST and known epidemiologic risk factors for Mtb infection."
https://openalex.org/W2152794841,"Tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells are correlated with prolonged progression-free and overall survival in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). A significant fraction of EOC patients mount autoantibody responses to various tumor antigens, however the relationship between autoantibodies and tumor-infiltrating T cells has not been investigated in EOC or any other human cancer. We hypothesized that autoantibody and T cell responses may be correlated in EOC and directed toward the same antigens.We obtained matched serum and tumor tissue from 35 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer. Serum samples were assessed by ELISA for autoantibodies to the common tumor antigen NY-ESO-1. Tumor tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry for expression of NY-ESO-1, various T cell markers (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD25, FoxP3, TIA-1 and Granzyme B) and other immunological markers (CD20, MHC class I and MHC class II). Lymphocytic infiltrates varied widely among tumors and included cells positive for CD3, CD8, TIA-1, CD25, FoxP3 and CD4. Twenty-six percent (9/35) of patients demonstrated serum IgG autoantibodies to NY-ESO-1, which were positively correlated with expression of NY-ESO-1 antigen by tumor cells (r = 0.57, p = 0.0004). Autoantibodies to NY-ESO-1 were associated with increased tumor-infiltrating CD8+, CD4+ and FoxP3+ cells. In an individual HLA-A2+ patient with autoantibodies to NY-ESO-1, CD8+ T cells isolated from solid tumor and ascites were reactive to NY-ESO-1 by IFN-gamma ELISPOT and MHC class I pentamer staining.We demonstrate that tumor-specific autoantibodies and tumor-infiltrating T cells are correlated in human cancer and can be directed against the same target antigen. This implies that autoantibodies may collaborate with tumor-infiltrating T cells to influence clinical outcomes in EOC.

The nodal/activin pathway represents one of the major signaling chains responsible for the differentiation of embryonic cells into mesodermal and endodermal germ layers, while Oct4 is one of the major players in the maintenance of an undifferentiated state. Here we show that Oct25, an Oct4 homologue in Xenopus, antagonizes the activity of nodal/activin signaling by inhibiting the transcription of its target genes, Gsc and Mix2. The inhibitory effect is achieved by forming repression complexes on the promoters of Gsc and Mix2 between Oct25 and the signal transducers of the nodal/activin pathway, WBSCR11, FAST1, and Smad2. We have analyzed the significance of the Oct binding site for its inhibitory effect within the Gsc promoter. Albeit VP16-Oct25 fusion protein demonstrated a stimulating effect and EVE-Oct25 revealed a repression effect on an artificial reporter that is composed of eight repeats of Oct binding motifs, both fusions, like wild-type Oct25, inhibited mesendoderm formation and the activity of Gsc and Mix2 promoters. These results suggest that the regulatory effect of Oct25 on the expression of Gsc and Mix2 is mediated by specific protein/protein interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that histone deacetylase activities are not required for the inhibitory effect of Oct25. Our results provide a novel view in that Oct25 controls the nodal/activin pathway and thus maintains the undifferentiated state of embryonic cells in preventing them from premature differentiation."

Several disease states, particularly hypertension, can be affected by modulation of epithelial sodium channel activity. Thus, understanding the biochemical function of prostasin and developing specific agents to inhibit its activity could have a significant impact on a widespread disease. We report the expression of the prostasin proenzyme in Escherichia coli as insoluble inclusion bodies, refolding and activating via proteolytic removal of the N-terminal propeptide. The refolded and activated enzyme was shown to be pure and monomeric, with kinetic characteristics very similar to prostasin expressed from eukaryotic systems. Active prostasin was crystallized, and the structure was determined to 1.45Å resolution. These apoprotein crystals were soaked with nafamostat, allowing the structure of the inhibited acyl-enzyme intermediate structure to be determined to 2.0Å resolution. Comparison of the inhibited and apoprotein forms of prostasin suggest a mechanism of regulation through stabilization of a loop which interferes with substrate recognition.

In these tissues sodium is primarily transported across the apical membrane via ENaC, and fluid transport across the membrane is highly responsive to sodium concentration. Inappropriate function of ENaC leads to misregulation of blood pressure in humans (11.Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar, 12.Snyder P.M.

Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar), suggesting that proper ENaC function may also be important in other diseases where sodium and fluid homeostasis is severely disrupted, for example cystic fibrosis and diarrhea (13.Donaldson S.H.

Some of these proteases require activation by yet other proteases (15.List K. Hobson J.P. Molinolo A. Bugge T.H. J. Cell.

Highly selective small-molecule inhibitors of proteases thought to modulate ENaC will aid in understanding the roles of different proteases in channel function and may also provide a therapeutic benefit for hypertension and other diseases, e.g. cystic fibrosis (12.Snyder P.M. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 5079-5085Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13.Donaldson S.H. Boucher R.C.

Although there are numerous agents for the treatment of hypertension, many individuals require multiple medications to achieve adequate control (17.Chobanian A.V. Bakris G.L. Black H.R. Cushman W.C. Green L.A. Izzo Jr., J.L. Jones D.W. Materson B.J. Oparil S. Wright Jr., J.T. Roccella E.J. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2003; 289: 2560-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (16544) Google Scholar), and the condition continues to exact a high cost to society, and so it seems that additional modes of treatment remain desirable. Prostasin belongs to the classical serine protease family, with homology to trypsin, chymotrypsin, and kallikrein, and has a trypsin-like substrate specificity (1.Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18843-18848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Yu J.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol.

Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In common with these, enzyme activation of prostasin occurs via cleavage of the pro-protein to produce a light chain and a heavy chain that are disulfide-linked. Prostasin has some features unusual in serine proteases, such as a high degree of sensitivity to monovalent and divalent cations, which may relate to the prostasin role in ENaC regulation (18.Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, to date there have been no reports of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of prostasin. High resolution structural studies have been used to significant advantage in the design of selective protease inhibitors (19.Congreve M. Murray C.W. Blundell T.L. Drug Discov. Today. 2005; 10: 895-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 20.Abbenante G. Fairlie D.P. Med. Chem. 2005; 1: 71-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 21.Leung D. Abbenante G.

Biol. 2005; 9: 371-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Availability of the three-dimensional structure of prostasin could offer a significant advantage in the design of prostasin inhibitors. Previous studies have shown that active prostasin can be expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system and purified to homogeneity, enabling more extensive biochemical studies (18.Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We report the expression of prostasin in Escherichia coli and the refolding, proteolytic activation, and purification to yield pure and fully active enzyme. Expression in E. coli is novel and can allow for rapid generation of site-directed mutants to allow the biochemical determination of structure-function relationships. We describe the high resolution crystal structure of the protease domain of this enzyme, which may provide valuable information in the design or optimization of specific small-molecule inhibitors. Construction of Prostasin Variants—The native sequence (accession number NM_002773) and all expression constructs are illustrated in Fig. 1. In all constructs the C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor domain and preceding linker were replaced with a His6 tag to aid in purification. Cysteines 154 and 203 were not expected to be involved in intradomain disulfide bonds and were mutated to serine and alanine (18.Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In the case of baculovirus variant 40, the N-linked glycosylation site was also removed via site-directed mutagenesis. For baculovirus expression constructs, the native signal sequence and propeptide were replaced with an insect cell signal sequence (melittin, GP64, or GP67) to generate the native N terminus of the mature protein, as the propeptide is not required for activity (18.Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression constructs contained the original native propeptide sequence at the N terminus but with the addition of an enterokinase recognition sequence to allow specific cleavage to generate the active enzyme. Detailed methods for the expression of prostasin in both baculovirus and E. coli are provided in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Refolding and Purification of Prostasin from E. coli—Prostasin variants 26 and 28 (Fig. 1) were solubilized from inclusion bodies in 8 m urea with 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, and 2 mm dithiothreitol after extensive washing. Solubilized protein was bound to nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow resin (Qiagen) and eluted with 0.3 m imidazole. The urea-solubilized material was then refolded in a buffer containing 1 m l-arginine, 0.1 m Tris/HCl, 5 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione, pH 8.0, at a final concentration of 10 mg/liter. After diafiltration, protein was purified via Ni(II) affinity and anion exchange chromatography. Eluted fractions were evaluated via SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry (MS), and fractions in which prostasin was detected by MS were then pooled for further processing. Prostasin zymogen was converted to the active form by addition of enterokinase (EKMax, Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 2 units/ml (7.5 units/mg prostasin) in the presence of 0.5 mm reduced glutathione. The resultant cleavage reaction was maintained at 4 °C for 48 h and monitored by MS and SDS-PAGE. After completion of cleavage as determined by MS, the reaction was incubated at 4 °C overnight after the addition of 1 mm oxidized glutathione. Active prostasin was purified from enterokinase and misfolded prostasin via Ni(II) affinity and anion exchange chromatography. Fractions were selected based on activity, then pooled to give the final purified prostasin for further characterization and crystallography. Further details of the purification are found in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Enzyme Assay—Enzyme assays were performed at ambient temperature (22–24 °C) in 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 9, with 0.1% CHAPS using a peptide substrate, Ac-KHYR-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Anaspec) at 50 μm (18.Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Data were collected using a BMGLabTech Fluostar Optima reader, with excitation and emission filter wavelengths of 340 and 450 nm, respectively. Measurements of Km were made by varying the concentration of substrate from 10–250 μm, whereas enzyme concentration was held constant at 19 nm. Absolute quantitation of product was determined by comparison to an independent 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin standard at concentrations from 2 nm to 1.7 μm. Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)—Analytical SEC measurements were made using a Superdex 200 5/150 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, and 0.3 m NaCl at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min with injections of 0.5–5 μg of protein. Retention times were converted to apparent molecular masses using mixed protein standards (thyroglobulin, gamma-globulin, ovalbumin, and myoglobin) (Bio-Rad). MS—Whole-protein mass measurements were made by binding samples (0.1–2 μg) to a reverse-phase protein trap column (Michrom), where they were desalted by washing with 2% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid and eluted with a solution of 64% acetonitrile, 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid into an electrospray mass spectrometer (LTQ, Thermo). The resultant spectra were deconvoluted using Promass (Novatia) to yield the whole protein mass. For free cysteine determination, samples were treated with 50 mm iodoacetamide at room temperature for 30 min before analysis. For active site determination, prostasin was incubated with 5 μm nafamostat mesylate (BioMol International) for 5 min in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, with a final NaCl concentration of 0.2 m or less before mass spectroscopic analysis (23.Ramjee M.K. Henderson I.M. McLoughlin S.B. Padova A. Thromb. Res. 2000; 98: 559-569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Protein Crystallization—Prostasin variant 26, comprising human prostasin residues 45–285 with the mutations C154S and C203A, a C-terminal thrombin-cleavage site, and His6 tag (Fig. 1B), and variant 28, comprising human prostasin residues 45–289 with the same mutations and C terminus, were concentrated to a final concentration of 12–14 mg/ml as determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.5, 0.1 m NaCl. Crystals of both variants were obtained by the vapor diffusion method. Initial crystals were obtained in hanging drops containing 1 μl of protein mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.3, and 30% polyethylene glycol 3350. Diffraction quality crystals formed as a result of streak seeding into hanging drops containing 1 μl of protein mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution consisting of 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.8, and 21–26% polyethylene glycol 3350. Crystals were cryoprotected for data collection in a solution containing 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm NaCl, and 20% ethylene glycol. Protein Structure Determination—In-house diffraction data were collected with Rigaku x-ray sources using R-Axis image plate detectors. Data were processed and scaled with HKL2000 (24.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser (25.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar) using the model of human plasma kallikrein (PDB code 2ANW) (26.Tang J. Yu C.L. Williams S.R. Springman E. Jeffery D. Sprengeler P.A. Estevez A. Sampang J. Shrader W. Spencer J. Young W. McGrath M. Katz B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41077-41089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The models for variant 28 apoprotein, and nafamostat-inhibited acyl-enzyme intermediate were built and improved with iterative cycles of manual rebuilding in Coot and MIFit followed by refinement with Refmac (27.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23241) Google Scholar, 28.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13857) Google Scholar). There was sufficient density to build the model continuously from residues Ile-45 to Gln-289, which encodes all of the native, mature protein residues. Nafamostat was introduced by soaking crystals of apoprotein in a buffer containing 1 mm nafamostat, 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 30% polyethylene glycol 3350. Structural alignments were performed using LSQMAN (29.Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure. 1997; 5: 1557-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Figures were generated using PyMOL (30.DeLano, W. L. (2002) The Pymol Molecular Graphics System Delano Scientific, Palo Alto, CAGoogle Scholar). Model geometry was verified using Procheck (31.Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Expression of Prostasin Variants—Initially, prostasin variants were expressed by secretion from insect cells, as used by Shipway et al. (18.Shipway A. Danahay H. Williams J.A. Tully D.C. Backes B.J. Harris J.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 324: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to examine the catalytic properties of prostasin. Although the expression levels for the glycosylated prostasin variants 801 and 35 (Fig. 1B) were acceptable (0.4–1.0 mg/liter) and the purified proteins were well behaved in solution and could be readily concentrated to 20 mg/ml, they did not form crystals using a broad screen of conditions. Prostasin variant 40, which lacks the N-linked glycosylation site, expressed to much lower levels in this system (<0.1 mg/liter). Expression in E. coli was examined in two strains: BL21(DE3) and Origami-2. In BL21(DE3), prostasin variants 26 and 28 expressed at 50–100 mg/liter as insoluble inclusion bodies. Although Origami-2 cells possess an oxidizing intracellular environment sometimes helpful in disulfide formation, as needed for prostasin, expression of prostasin variants 26 and 28 in these cells gave mainly insoluble protein at 1–5 mg/liter. Accordingly, prostasin variants 26 and 28 were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and refolded in vitro. Refolding of Prostasin—The primary challenge to devising a refolding protocol for prostasin was evaluating the product for the correctness of its fold. Although enzymatic activity would normally be the preferred measure of success, prostasin was expressed in the inactive zymogen form to ensure generation of a native N terminus. Enterokinase, the enzyme used to cleave the propeptide, was active in the prostasin assay, making interpretation of activity assays from mixtures containing both enzymes problematic. Although the amount of soluble protein captured on Ni(II) columns was of some guidance (Table 1, buffer additive conditions: none, 2 m urea, and 0.4 m l-arginine), the majority of the protein in these mixtures seemed to be misfolded aggregates. The best tool in these circumstances to judge the quality of refolded zymogen was MS after reverse-phase chromatography. Misfolded proteins are adsorbed much more strongly to the reverse-phase surface than well folded proteins (32.Hearn M.T.W. Gooding K.M. Regnier F.E. HPLC of Biological Macromolecules. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York2002: 99-246Google Scholar, 33.Corran P.H. Oliver R.W.A. HPLC of Macromolecules: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 127-156Google Scholar), whereas MS ensures accurate identification of the protein species eluted from the column. Purification of the solubilized protein on Ni(II) affinity media was performed to simplify the mass spectrum observed after refolding, making the analysis more consistent and semiquantitative. Using these tools, small-scale refolding experiments were carried out to find optimal conditions, detailed in Table 1. In scaled-up refolds, although the yields of soluble protein after refolding and the first chromatographic step were quite reasonable, the pool still contained substantial amounts of misfolded protein. Prostasin zymogen was heterogeneous by both anion exchange chromatography (supplemental Fig. 1) and analytical SEC, which showed a mixture of monomer with an apparent size of 37 kDa, dimer at ∼ 70 kDa, and larger species (Fig. 2B, dashed line).TABLE 1Results of refolding conditions Shown are refolding results for prostasin variant 28. Yields are expressed as total protein (determined by the Bradford assay) per liter of refold buffer either from pooled fractions after the first chromatographic step or for the final purified protein. Mass spectroscopic signal was assessed on a qualitative basis for different conditions, each with a nominal 1-μg protein injection. All conditions used a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm reduced glutathione, and 0.5 mm oxidized glutathione.

Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8642-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage was rapid and completely specific when monitored by MS, whereas SDS-PAGE continued to show that some of the protein was resistant to cleavage, which we hypothesized was misfolded. After cleavage, prostasin was purified on two additional columns. The Ni(II) affinity column was used primarily to remove enterokinase, after which prostasin could be tracked and quantified via activity assay. The final anion exchange step proved to be the most important in removing misfolded species. Active prostasin eluted as the first species from the column at a considerably lower ionic strength than either the zymogen or aggregated species (Fig. 2A), and activity coincided only with this first peak (Fig. 2A, dashed line). In contrast to the zymogen, MS of the fractions from the anion exchange column showed that >95% of the MS-active species coincided with the first peak. Analytical SEC and SDS-PAGE of later fractions from the anion-exchange column showed that these contained prostasin in an inactive, aggregated state (data not shown). Although both variants 26 and 28 could be refolded to yield active protein, the final yield of active protein was only 1–2% as the bulk of the protein formed inactive misfolded species and was removed on the final chromatographic step. Characterization of the Final Refolded Protein—Refolded prostasin was of high purity as shown in the gel (Fig. 3). SEC is often used to profile refolded protein, as it readily distinguishes lower-order species from the aggregates that result from misfolding. As seen in Fig. 2B, purified refolded prostasin eluted as a single peak, corresponding to a molecular mass of 24 kDa, identical to that seen for prostasin variants 801 and 35 (supplemental Table 2). Given that the cleaved propeptide has a molecular mass of 2 kDa, the difference between monomeric zymogen, which elutes from SEC with an apparent mass of 37 kDa (actual mass 30 kDa) and the active protein (actual mass 28 kDa), is remarkable. The active protein is more compact in terms of hydrodynamic radius, which may be related to its tendency to adopt a native disulfide configuration (34.al-Obeidi A.M. Light A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8642-8645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A more demanding measure of the quality of the refolded protein is a comparison of its kinetic constants with that of similar variants folded in eukaryotic cells. Initial reaction rates were measured across a range of substrate concentrations, and an example of the resulting data is shown in Fig. 4 along with the nonlinear curve fi"
https://openalex.org/W2129881968,"Lipid signaling involved in mechanotransduction processes in response to shear stress in plants remained elusive. To understand the responses of phospholipids in shear stress-induced mechanotransduction, a lipidomic approach was employed to profile phospholipid species of Taxus cuspidata cells under laminar shear stress. A total of 99 phospholipid species were profiled quantitatively, using the LC/ESI/MS(n) procedure. Potential biomarkers were found by the principal component analysis (PCA) as well as partial least squares (PLS) combined with variable influence in the projection (VIP). Phosphatidic acid (PA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) were two important lipid groups that were responsible for the discrimination between shear stress induced and control cells. Further research revealed that shear stress enhanced the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) and phospholipase C (PLC) compared with control cells and consequently increased PA content in shear stress induced T. cuspidata cells. These results demonstrate that phospholipids and related phospholipases play important roles in mechanotransduction of T. cuspidata cells in response to shear stress."
https://openalex.org/W1984815339,"Antibodies against conserved epitopes on HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins (Env), such as the gp120 CD4-binding site (CD4bs), could contribute to protection against HIV-1. Env-based immunogens inducing such a response could be a major component of future anti-HIV-1 strategies. In this proof-of-concept study we describe the generation of two anti-idiotype (AI) murine antibodies mimicking the CD4bs epitope. Sera were collected from long-term non-progressor patients to obtain CD4bs-directed IgG, through sequential purification steps. The purified IgG were then used as Fab fragments to immunize mice for hybridoma generation. Two hybridomas (P1 and P2), reacting only against the CD4bs-directed IgG, were identified and characterized. The P1 and P2 antibodies were shown to recognize the idiotype of the broadly neutralizing anti-CD4bs human mAb b12. Both P1 and P2 Fabs were able to induce a strong anti-gp120 response in rabbits. Moreover, the rabbits' sera were shown to neutralize two sensitive tier 1 strains of HIV-1 in an Env-pseudotype neutralization assay. In particular, 3/5 rabbits in the P1 group and 1/5 in the P2 group showed greater than 80% neutralizing activity against the HXB2 pseudovirus. Two rabbits also neutralized the pseudovirus HIV-MN. Overall, these data describe the first anti-idiotypic vaccine approach performed to generate antibodies to the CD4bs of the HIV-1 gp120. Although future studies will be necessary to improve strength and breadth of the elicited neutralizing response, this proof-of-concept study documents that immunogens designed on the idiotype of broadly neutralizing Abs are feasible and could help in the design of future anti-HIV strategies."

Currently, the event(s) that regulates Mad1 movement from the nuclear pore complex to microtubule-unattached kinetochores is unknown. Understanding how Mad1 activity is modulated is important for several reasons. First, aberrant Mad1 expression is linked to the development of human small cell lung cancer (21Coe B.P. Lee E.H. Chi B.

Cell. 1998; 93: 81-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). However, the consequences of Mad1 phosphorylation have not been characterized. Here, we demonstrate that Mad1 is hyperphosphorylated when Plk1 is overexpressed and that the kinase activity of Plk1 is required for Mad1 to locate to microtubule-unattached kinetochores. We identified several intracellular phosphorylation sites in Mad1 and showed that loss of a Thr680-phosphorylated site in Mad1 converted the protein to a dominant negative mutant.

The primers used are 5′-gaggtgttcgcgggcatgattgtgcctaagtc-3′ and 5′-gacttaggcacaatcatgcccgcgaacacctc-3′. Rabbit Mad1 antibodies were raised against recombinant GST-Mad1-N (amino acids 1-301) or GST-Mad1-C (amino acids 402-718). The rabbit Mad1 anti-sera were first captured with protein A-agarose (Bio-Rad), and then affinity purified using GST-Mad1-N or GST-Mad1-C fusion proteins conjugated to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad). Commercial reagents were obtained as follows: monoclonal anti-Plk1 antibodies were from Invitrogen and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); the human CREST antiserum was from Cortex Biochem (San Leandro, CA); the rabbit anti-Mad2 antibody was from Covance (Denver, PA); the rabbit anti-securin (PTTG) antibody was from Invitrogen; the rabbit anti-Aurora B and mouse anti-cyclin B1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies were from Sigma; monoclonal anti-BubR1 antibody was from MBL (Woburn, MA); monoclonal anti-Mps1 antibody was from Millipore (Billerica, MA); monoclonal anti-phospho-Ser/Thr/Tyr antibody (αpSYT) was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Validated synthetic siRNA duplexes targeting Plk1 (Hs_Plk1_7: 5′-CGCGGGCAAGAUUGUGCCUAA-3′) and Mad1 (5′-CAGCGATTGTGAAGAACATGA-3′ and 5′-CAGGACCAAAGTGCTGCACAT-3′) were from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Nocodazole, thymidine, and Plk1 inhibitor GW843682X were purchased from Sigma. Purified bioactive Plk1 protein was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Boston, MA). Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10! fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine and antibiotics. Generation of stable cell lines expressing FLAG-tagged human Mad1 (HeLa-FlagMad1) was initiated by transfecting pCDNA-FlagMad1 plasmid into HeLa cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 24 h after transfection, cells were divided into 15-cm culture dishes and selected in complete medium containing 0.7 mg/ml G418. G418-resistant colonies were individually cloned and checked by Western blotting and PCR. Stable cell clones were maintained in medium supplemented with 0.3 mg/ml G418. Transfection of siRNA duplexes was performed using TransMessenger transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell Synchronization—For synchronization, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 12 h and released from the G1/S block into fresh medium. 12 h after release, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine again for another 12 h to obtain G1/S-synchronized cells. G2 phase cells were prepared by releasing G1/S cells from double thymidine block for 7 h. M phase cells were prepared by a 5-h treatment with spindle toxin (i.e. 200 nm nocodazole) 7 h after cells were released from double-thymidine block. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—For co-immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), harvested, and lysed with RIPA buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) containing 0.5! Nonidet P-40 and then sheared using a 22-gauge needle. Cleared lysates were incubated with antibody-conjugated agarose beads for 16 h at 4 °C. The agarose beads were then washed 5 times with RIPA buffer. The co-immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/Western blotting. For Western analyses, samples were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes, which were blocked with 0.2! I-Block (Tropix, Bedford, MA) in PBS and 0.1! Tween 20. The primary antibodies were used at 1:1,000 to 1:10,000 dilutions. For immunoblotting using αpSYT, membranes were blocked with 5! (w/v) bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1! Tween 20 (TBST). The αpSYT antibody was diluted 1:2,000 in TBST. For secondary antibodies, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit (Sigma) was used, and detection was by chemiluminescence following the manufacturer's protocol (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Cells were washed twice with PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Cell pellets were resuspended in ReadyPrep reagent 3 from Bio-Rad containing 5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 2! CHAPS, 2! SB 3-10, 40 mm Tris, and 0.2! Bio-Lyte 3/10 ampholyte. IPG strips (11 cm) with pH ranges 4 to 7 and a PROTEAN IEF Cell (Bio-Rad) were used for isoelectric focusing. Isoelectric focusing was performed using a two-phase protocol: (i) 250 V for 10 min, and (ii) 250-8000 V slow ramping voltage gradient to accumulate 35,000 total volt-hours. The focused IPG strips were equilibrated in reducing reagent (37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 2! SDS, 20! glycerol, 130 mm dithiothreitol) and alkylation reagent (37.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 2! SDS, 20! glycerol, 135 mm iodoacetamide) before the second SDS-PAGE dimension. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were fixed in 4! paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and permeablized with 0.1! Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. For γ-tubulin staining, cells were fixed with methanol for 10 min at -20 °C. To block nonspecific binding, cells were incubated with 1! bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Antibodies against Mad1, Plk1, Mad2, HA, γ-tubulin, Bub1, BubR1, Cenp-E, or CREST were added to cells at dilutions of 1:200 to 1:2000 and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS and then probed with fluorescent (Alexa 488, Alexa 594, or Alexa 647)-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Cells on coverslips were mounted onto glass slides with Pro-Long Gold antifade reagents (Invitrogen), and slides were visualized using a Leica TCS-NP/SP confocal microscope. Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Protein bands were excised and gel slices were washed successively with ultra-pure water and 100! acetonitrile, then reduced with 50 mm dithiothreitol and alkylated with 55 mm iodoacetamide. The material was dried in a SpeedVac, and rehydrated in a 12.5 ng/μl trypsin, 15 ng/μl elastase, or 5 ng/μl AspN/GluC solutions. Trypsin and AspN/GluC digests were carried out in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 10! acetonitrile, pH 8.0. Elastase digests were performed under the same conditions without acetonitrile. Peptides were extracted 2 times with 25 μl of 50! acetonitrile, 5! formic acid and dried in a SpeedVac. Phosphopeptide enrichment was performed using the Phos-trap™ Phosphopeptide Enrichment kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. Phosphopeptides were resuspended in 20 μl of buffer A (5! acetonitrile, 0.1! formic acid, 0.005! heptafluorobutyric acid) and 3-6 μl were loaded onto a 12 cm × 0.075-mm fused silica capillary column packed with 5 μm diameter C-18 beads (The Nest Group, Southboro, MA). Peptides were eluted by applying a 0-80! linear gradient of buffer B (95! acetonitrile, 0.1! formic acid, 0.005! HFBA) at a flow rate of 150 μl/min with a pre-column flow splitter resulting in a final flow rate of ∼200 nl/min directly into the source. A LTQ™ Linear Ion Trap (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) was run in an automated collection mode with an instrument method composed of a single segment and 5 data-dependent scan events with a full MS scan followed by 4 MS/MS scans of the highest intensity ions. Normalized collision energy was set at 35, activation Q was 0.250 with minimum full scan signal intensity at 1 × 105 with no minimum MS2 intensity specified. Dynamic exclusion was turned on utilizing a 3-min repeat count of 2 with the mass width set at 1.0 m/z. Sequence analysis was performed with TurboSEQUEST™ (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) or MASCOT (Matrix Sciences, London, United Kingdom) using the non-redundant protein data base from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) web site. Cell Cycle-dependent Phosphorylation of Mad1—Mad1 was first reported to be phosphorylated upon SAC activation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (6Hardwick K.G. Murray A.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 709-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To establish human Mad1 as a phosphoprotein, we employed classical [32P]orthophosphate biosynthetic labeling of cultured cells followed by immunoprecipitation using a mixture of antibodies raised to the N and C terminus of Mad1 (αMad1-N and αMad1-C). HeLa cells were mock-transfected (Fig. 1A, lane 1), transfected with full-length Mad1 vector, or with vectors that express the indicated Mad1 deletion mutant (Fig. 1A, lanes 2-6). After biosynthetic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate for 24 h, Mad1 protein was immunoprecipitated. Subsequent gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of the immunoprecipitates verified 32P-incorporation into full-length Mad1 (both the cell endogenous and the transfected forms, Fig. 1A, lanes 1-2) and each of the transfected Mad1 deletion mutants (Fig. 1A, lanes 3-6). These results support the ambient phosphorylation of Mad1 in cultured cells. To study the kinetics of Mad1 phosphorylation, we constructed a cell line (HeLa-FlagMad1) that stably expresses an integrated FlagMad1 vector. We enriched HeLa-FlagMad1 cells in various cell cycle phases, and immunoprecipitated FlagMad1 using monoclonal anti-FLAG-agarose beads. Mad1-phosphorylation was assessed first by Western blotting using an antibody (αpSTY) that recognizes a phosphorylated serine/threonine/or tyrosine residue. Indeed, the αpSTY antibody visualized a phosphorylated ∼85-kDa Mad1 protein in M-cells, but did not detect phosphor-Mad1 in unsynchronized (U) cells or cells enriched in either G1/S or G2 (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-3). Interestingly, the level of phosphorylated Mad1 detected by αpSTY diminished progressively the longer HeLa-FlagMad1 cells were released from nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest (Fig. 1B, lanes 4-6). These results suggest that αpSTY recognizes a phosphorylated Mad1 specific to the M-phase. We next characterized Mad1 using two-dimensional isoelectric focusing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1C). Mad1 proteins were “focused” to discrete isoelectric points and were visualized by Western blotting using αMad1-C serum. We compared the two-dimensional profiles of Mad1 in interphase (G1/S and G2) and M phase. In G1/S and G2 cells, Mad1 focused to 3 to 4 spots of varying intensities, consistent with multiple phosphorylation sites as suggested by the biosynthetic 32P-incorporation data (Fig. 1A). In M-cells, the isoelectric points (pI) of Mad1 were shifted toward the cathode (pH 4.0, Fig. 1C), a finding consistent with hyperphosphorylation. Of note, the control focusing profiles of actin in the different samples were unchanged (Fig. 1C). Mad1 Interacts with Plk1—Several mitotic kinases have been suggested to regulate the kinetochore localization of Mad1. These kinases include Bub1, BubR1, Mps1, and Plk1 (34Palframan W.J. Meehl J.B. Jaspersen S.L. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 2006; 313: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 35Vigneron S. Prieto S. Bernis C. Labbe J.C. Castro A. Lorca T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 4584-4596Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 36Wong O.K. Fang G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To gain insight into Mad1 phosphorylation, we asked whether Mad1 interacts with the various mitotic kinase(s). We overexpressed Plk1, BubR1, Bub1, Aurora B, or Mps1 separately in cells with FLAG-tagged Mad1 and arrested the cells in M using nocodazole. Cell lysates were then immunoprecipitated for Mad1, and the co-precipitated proteins were analyzed. In these experiments, the Mad2 protein was employed as a positive control that co-immunoprecipitates with Mad1. Indeed, cell endogenous Mad2 was reproducibly seen with FLAG-Mad1 in all the assays (Fig. 2A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8, and supplementary Fig. S1). Our co-immunoprecipitations did reveal that Plk1, but not BubR1, Bub1, Aurora B, or Mps1, was associated with Mad1 (Fig. 2A and supplementary Fig. S1). Although a previous report had suggested that BubR1 phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts required Mad1 (37Chen R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we did not observe a Mad1-BubR1 co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2A, lanes 5-8). Similarly, whereas Bub1 has been reported to phosphorylate human Mad1 in vitro (38Seeley T.W. Wang L. Zhen J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 257: 589-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and Mps1 has been shown to phosphorylate Mad1p in budding yeast (39Hardwick K.G. Weiss E. Luca F.C. Winey M. Murray A.W. Science. 1996; 273: 953-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), neither Bub1 nor Mps1 was co-immunoprecipitated with Mad1 from our M-arrested human cell lysates (Fig. S1). These findings support a preferential interaction between Mad1 and Plk1 that was not seen between Mad1 and the other mitotic kinases. However, our findings do not exclude the possibility that under other conditions Mad1 could interact with mitotic kinases other than Plk1. To extend the results from the above overexpression experiments, we asked next whether cell endogenous Mad1 and Plk1 would similarly interact. An association between cell endogenous Mad1 and Plk1 in M phase was demonstrated by immunoprecipitating the former using a mixture of αMad1-N and αMad1-C antibodies (Fig. 2B). We observed that Plk1 co-precipitated with Mad1 from M phase-enriched cells (M) but not from asynchronous (U) cells (Fig. 2B). The results indicate a cell cycle-regulated Mad1-Plk1 interaction. Mad1 is a coiled-coiled protein with a nuclear localization signal (amino acids 381-400) and two leucine zippers, positioned at 501-522 and 557-571, respectively (40Iwanaga Y. Kasai T. Kibler K. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31005-31013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). To characterize the Plk1 interacting region of Mad1, we overexpressed Plk1 separately with a HA-tagged WT Mad1 or one of several HA-tagged Mad1 deletion mutants (Fig. 2C, top schematics). We performed co-immunoprecipitations from cells transfected with these expression plasmids. The results revealed that a Mad1 deletion mutant removed in its carboxyl 400 amino acids (i.e. Mad1ΔC2, amino acids 1-318) failed to co-precipitate Plk1 (Fig. 2C), and that the Mad1ΔN2 mutant (containing amino acids 401-718) also captured Plk1 poorly. By contrast, two other Mad1 deletion mutants that retained the nuclear localization signal (i.e. ΔN1, ΔC1) co-precipitated Plk1 well (Fig. 2C). Whereas other interpretations are possible, these findings are consistent with a requirement of the central nuclear localization signal region of Mad1 for Plk1 interaction. Plk1 Is Required for Mad1 Association with Spindle-unattached Kinetochores—Mad1 is found at nuclear pores in interphase cells and at spindle-unattached kinetochores in mitotic cells (13Campbell M.S. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 953-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further characterize the Mad1-Plk1 interaction, we asked whether the two proteins co-localize inside cells. Prior to nuclear envelope breakdown, Plk1 was seen with Mad1 at the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3A, panels 1-3); later, as the cell entered prometaphase, both proteins were together at kinetochores (Fig. 3A, panels 4-6). Consistent with findings from others (13Campbell M.S. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 953-963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Mad1, but not Plk1 (41van Vugt M.A. Medema R.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2844-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), departed spindle-attached kinetochores as the cell moved into metaphase (Fig. 3A, panels 7-9). Interestingly, some Mad1 protein persisted with Plk1 at the spindle poles (Fig. 3A, panels 1-9, indicated by arrows; the centrosomes were verified by staining for γ-tubulin; Fig. 3A, panels 10-18). The functional significance of centrosomal Mad1-Plk1 co-localization remains to be investigated. The Mad1 and Plk1 co-immunoprecipitations and co-localizations prompted us to ask if the latter could affect the function of the former. To investigate how Plk1 might influence Mad1 activity, we first used siRNA to knockdown Plk1. A >90! siRNA knockdown of Plk1 was achieved (Fig. 3B), and this depletion did not affect the level of cell endogenous Mad1 (Fig. 3B). Elsewhere, depletion of Plk1 has been reported to inhibit centrosome maturation and elicit prometaphase arrest with monoastral spindles (42Sumara I. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Gerlich D. Hirota T. Kraft C. de la Torre C. Ellenberg J. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1712-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In our Plk1 knockdown cells, the mitotic index (cells staining positive for anti-phosphorylated histone H3 Ser10 (red, Fig. 3C)) increased from 6! in control siRNA cells to 30! in Plk1-siRNA cells (Fig. 3C). This increase agrees with previously described mitotic arrest observed when cells were Plk1-depleted (42Sumara I. Gimenez-Abian J.F. Gerlich D. Hirota T. Kraft C. de la Torre C. Ellenberg J. Peters J.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1712-1722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). We noted a slight apparent accumulation of Mad1 in Plk1 knockdown cells. We do not know the reason for this small apparent increase, which may have resulted from some indirect changes in the cell arising as a consequence of Plk1 knock down. We next examined the subcellular localization of Mad1 in Plk1 knockdown cells. Mad1 was found at spindle-unattached kinetochores in control siRNA cells (Fig. 3D, panels 1-4); however, in Plk1-siRNA cells, Mad1 was not concentrated at the kinetochores but was dispersed into the mitotic cytosol (Fig. 3D, panels 5-8). Similarly, the localizations of Mad2 mirrored those of Mad1 in both control RNAi (Fig. 3D, panels 9-12) and Plk1-RNAi (Fig. 3D, panels 13-16) cells. These Mad2 findings agree with a Plk1 requirement for Mad2-kinetochore localization as reported previously by some investigators (43Ahonen L.J. Kallio M.J. Daum J.R. Bolton M. Manke I.A. Yaffe M.B.

Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). By comparison, the cellular localizations of Bub1, BubR1, and Cenp-E were not changed in the Plk1-siRNA cells (supplementary Fig. S2 and Refs. 35Vigneron S. Prieto S. Bernis C. Labbe J.C. Castro A.

Thus in our knockdown cells, Plk1 is selectively required for the kinetochore association of Mad1 and Mad2. Plk1 has multiple functions including mitotic entry, spindle formation, and cytokinesis. These functions require the kinase activity of Plk1 (33Seong Y.S. Kamijo K. Lee J.S. Fernandez E. Kuriyama R. Miki T. Lee K.S. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W1967390450,"Background Association of mitochondrial haplogroup J with longevity has been reported in several population subgroups. While studies from northern Italy and Finland, have described a higher frequency of haplogroup J among centenarians in comparison to non-centenarian, several other studies could not replicate these results and suggested various explanations for the discrepancy. Methodology/Principal Findings We have evaluated haplogroup frequencies among Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians using two different sets of matched controls. No difference was observed in the haplogroup J frequencies between the centenarians or either matched control group, despite adequate statistical power to detect such a difference. Furthermore, the lack of association was robust to population substructure in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Given this discrepancy with the previous reported associations in the northern Italian and the Finnish populations, we conducted re-analysis of these previously published data, which supported one of several possible explanations: i) inadequate matching of cases and controls; ii) inadequate adjustment for multiple comparison testing; iii) cryptic population stratification. Conclusions/Significance There does not exist a universal association of mitochondrial haplogroup J with longevity across all population groups. Reported associations in specialized populations may reflect genetic or other interactions specific to those populations or else cryptic confounding influences, such as inadequate matching attributable to population substructure, which are of general relevance to all studies of the possible association of mitochondrial DNA haplogroups with common complex phenotypes."

The microbial hydrolysis of the plant cell wall is a pivotal biological process that is integral to the carbon cycle and is thus essential for the maintenance of terrestrial life. This process is also of growing industrial significance, particularly within the bioenergy sector where lignocellulosic biomass is a valuable and abundant substrate for the production of bioethanol and other liquid fuels (1Ragauskas A.J. Williams C.K. Davison B.H. Britovsek G. Cairney J. Eckert C.A. Frederick Jr., W.J. Hallett J.P. Leak D.J. Liotta C.L. Mielenz J.R. Murphy R. Templer R. Tschaplinski T.

The most abundant hemicellulose polysaccharide in the majority of terrestrial plant cell walls is xylan (3Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1996Google Scholar). This polymer consists of a backbone of β1,4-linked xylose residues that can be decorated at O-2 and/or O-3 with arabinofuranose or acetyl groups, whereas 4-methyl-d-glucuronic acid is linked exclusively α1,2 to the xylan backbone (3Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1996Google Scholar). A further elaboration of xylan structure is provided by the esterification of some arabinofuranose side chains, at O-5, with ferulic acid (Fig. 1) that in turn may include a component of the aromatic heteropolymer lignin (3Brett C.T. Waldren K. Physiology and Biochemistry of Plant Cell Walls. Chapman and Hall Ltd., London1996Google Scholar).Saprophytic prokaryotes, such as Cellvibrio japonicus, which utilize the plant cell wall as a major carbon and energy source, synthesize an extensive repertoire of extracellular and membrane-associated hydrolytic enzymes that degrade all the major plant structural polysaccharides, including xylan (for review see Refs. 4Hazlewood G.P.

Consistent with the complex structure of xylans, the polysaccharide is degraded by a combination of endo-β1,4-xylanases (6Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G.P. Laurie J.I. Orpin C.G. Xue G.P. Mol.

Faulds C.B. Kroon P.A. Waldron K. Gilbert H.J. Hazlewood G. Williamson G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1997; 63: 208-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the recent completion of the genome sequence of C. japonicus revealed ∼150 genes encoding complex carbohydrate-modifying enzymes, primarily glycoside hydrolases and carbohydrate esterases, the majority of which attack the plant cell wall (13Deboy R.T. Mongodin E.F. Fouts D.E. Tailford L.E. Khouri H. Emerson J.B. Mohamoud Y. Watkins K. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Nelson K.E. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5455-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Current understanding of the mechanism by which the plant cell wall, a highly complex and insoluble recalcitrant macromolecular structure, modulates the expression of the plant cell wall-degrading machinery in microorganisms is at best fragmentary. Although the complete xylan-degrading system is expressed when C. japonicus is presented with decorated xylans (14Emami K. Nagy T. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4124-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), it is unknown whether there is a common inducer for all the enzymes required for complete saccharification of the polysaccharide, or whether different molecules (derived from decorated xylans) act as inducing triggers for specific subsets of these glycoside hydrolases and esterases. Indeed, Emami et al. (14Emami K. Nagy T. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4124-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) have shown that the expression of the bacterium xylanases is controlled by a complex regulatory system. Thus, although xylan induces the transcription of the five C. japonicus xylanase genes, there are clear differences in the temporal expression of these enzymes. It has been proposed that low level constitutive expression of specific glycosyl hydrolases releases mono- or oligosaccharides (from plant cell walls) that enter the microbial cytoplasm and, by binding directly to regulatory proteins, influence their activity (15Wang P. Ali S. Mason J.C. Sims P.F.G. Broda P. Visser J. Beldman G. Kusters-van Someren M.A. Voragen A.G.J. Xylanases from Streptomyces cyaneus. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1997: 25-32Google Scholar). Support for this hypothesis is provided by studies on ascomycete plant cell wall-degrading fungi; in these organisms xylose binds to and modulates the activity of the transcription factor XlnR, which activates xylanase gene expression (16Hasper A.A. Visser J. de Graaff L.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Similarly, the disaccharide sophorose appears to induce fungal cellulase activity by interacting with the transcription factors ACEI and ACEII (17Aro N. Saloheimo A. Ilmen M. Penttila M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 24309-24314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 18Saloheimo A. Aro N. Ilmen M. Penttila M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5817-5825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), whereas in Geobacillus stearothermophilus the activity of the repressor protein UxuR (which controls transcription of a glucuronoxylan metabolizing system) is modulated by 4-methyl-O-glucuronic acid-xylotriose (19Shulami S. Gat O. Sonenshein A.L. Shoham Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 3695-3704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, it has emerged recently that extracellular signals can activate bacterial glycoside hydrolases by interacting with the extracytoplasmic domains of hybrid two-component system proteins (20Miyazaki K. Miyamoto H. Mercer D.K. Hirase T. Martin J.C. Kojima Y. Flint H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2219-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 21Sonnenburg E.D. Sonnenburg J.L. Manchester J.K.

A. 2006; 103: 8834-8839Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), in which the sensor kinase and response regulator are contained within a single polypeptide. The nature of the signals that activate these sensor proteins, however, remains unclear.Here we have deployed a transposon mutagenesis strategy to identify regulatory proteins of C. japonicus that control the expression of the arabinofuranosidase CjAbf51A, an important and highly expressed component of the xylan-degrading apparatus of the bacterium (9Beylot M.H. McKie V.A. Voragen A.G. Doeswijk-Voragen C.H. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 22Beylot M.H. Emami K. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Pell G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We show that a canonical two-component system, comprising AbfS and AbfR, activates the expression of the repertoire of cell-associated enzymes, including CjAbf51A, that remove the decorations from xylan, but does not control the synthesis of the xylanases that attack the β1,4-linked xylose polymeric backbone. The ligands that activate AbfS were shown to be arabinoxylo-oligosaccharides. The crystal structure of the sensor domain of AbfS displays a typical PAS-fold (Per Arndt Sim) fold, a large family of proteins with sensory and signaling functions that can often be difficult to identify by sequence homology alone. The structure of the sensor domain of AbfS enabled the likely binding site for the activating ligand to be identified. The biological significance for a regulatory system that controls the expression of enzymes that remove the side chains but not the xylanases that hydrolyze the backbone of xylans is discussed.MATERIALS AND METHODSBacterial Strains, Plasmids, and Culture Conditions—The Escherichia coli strains used in this study were CH545 harboring pJB4JI (14Emami K. Nagy T. Fontes C.M. Ferreira L.M. Gilbert H.J. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 4124-4133Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and BL21 (DE3):pLysS, B834 (DE3) (Novagen). All E. coli strains containing recombinant plasmids were cultured in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin or kanamycin, as appropriate, at 37 °C unless otherwise stated. To grow C. japonicus, a rifampicin-resistant mutant of the bacterium was cultured in either LB or minimal medium, which consists of M9 salts and the appropriate carbon source, either monosaccharide or polysaccharide, at a final concentration of 0.2%. The Cellvibrio was grown either in liquid culture at 30 °C with high aeration (200 rpm) for up to 36 h in medium comprising <10% (v/v) of the incubator vessel (conical flask) or on solid media at 28 °C for up to 2 weeks.Transposon Mutagenesis—The transposon Tn10 was randomly inserted into the genome of C. japonicus as described previously (22Beylot M.H. Emami K. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Pell G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To screen 104 colonies from the transposon library, plates containing transconjugant colonies were picked and cultured for 4 days at 30 °C on LB-agar supplemented with wheat arabinoxylan at which point large colonies were visible. The plates were then overlaid with 3.5 ml of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 4 mm 4-methylumbellerfyl α-l-arabinofuranoside (MUA) 6The abbreviations used are: MUA, 4-methylumbellerfyl α-l-arabinofuranoside; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis; SIRAS, single wave-length isomorphous replacement anomalous scattering; PDB, Protein Data Bank; HMM, Hidden Markov Model; NCS, noncrystallographic symmetry; PYP, photoactive yellow protein; PAS, Per Arndt Sim. which, when cleaved, produces the fluorescent compound methylumbelliferone. After 15 min, the plates were inspected over a UV transilluminator, and cells that did not fluoresce (or fluoresced more brightly than the wild type bacterium) were selected for further study. As CjAbf51A is the only C. japonicus enzyme that can hydrolyze MUA (22Beylot M.H. Emami K. McKie V.A. Gilbert H.J. Pell G. Biochem. J. 2001; 358: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the mutants that displayed altered MUAase expression exhibit a change in the expression level of the arabinofuranosidase. To identify the genes interrupted by the Tn10 insertions, chromosomal DNA from selected transconjugants were digested with NcoI (cuts once within the transposon outside the kanamycin resistance gene) and cloned into pMTL22p. Transformants containing Tn10 insertions were identified by their kanamycin-resistant phenotype. Using the sequencing of the NcoI C. japonicus insertions, which extends from the transposon into the flanking DNA, to interrogate the sequence of the C. japonicus genome led to the identification of the gene disrupted by Tn10.Expression and Purification of AbfSSD and AbfR—The region of the AbfS gene encoding AbfSSD (amino acids 42–165 of AbfS) was amplified by PCR using Taq polymerase, the primers 5′-CTCCATATGGATATAACGCCGGAAGGCAACTTCC-3′ and 5′-CTCCTCGAGATTTTCGAGAAACATTTCCCAAATGATATCCCG-3′, and C. japonicus genomic DNA as the template. The amplified DNA was digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into similarly restricted pET22b to generate pJH1. AbfSSD was produced as a soluble, His6-tagged fusion protein in E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pJH1 by culturing the bacterium at 30 °C to mid-exponential phase (A600 nm 0.6), and recombinant protein expression was then induced by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm and incubation overnight at 16 °C. The sensor protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by immobilized metal anion chromatography and size exclusion chromatography using Talon™ and Superdex-75, respectively, using methodology described previously (24Tailford L.E. Money V.A. Smith N.L. Dumon C. Davies G.J. Gilbert H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 11291-11299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). AbfSSD was eluted from the Talon column with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 30 mm NaCl and 100 mm imidazole. Selenomethionyl-substituted AbfSSD was overproduced in the E. coli methionine auxotroph B834 (DE3) and purified by the same procedure as for native AbfSSD except that all buffers contained 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol.To express the DNA binding domain of AbfR in E. coli, the corresponding region of the gene was amplified by PCR from chromosomal C. japonicus DNA using Taq polymerase and the following primers: 5′-AACATATGCTCAAAATTCTCCTCATTGATGATG-3′ and 5′-AAGGATCCTTACTGCTCGTCATTCAGGGTCAACATG-3′. The amplified DNA was cloned into NdeI-BamHI-restricted pET16b site to generate pTN2, which encodes AbfR containing an N-terminal His6 tag. AbfR was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring pLysS and pTN2 employing the same growth conditions used to produce AbfSD. The response regulator was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, as described for AbfSD, and then by anion exchange chromatography using a Bio-Rad Q column. Unbound protein was removed from the column in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (Buffer A), pH 8.0, and AbfR was eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A.Mutagenesis of AbfSD—Amino acid substitutions were introduced into AbfSSD using PCR-based methodology deploying the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene).DNA Binding Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) used infra-red dye-labeled probe corresponding to the promoter of abf51A (gene encoding CjAbf51A) extending from nucleotides -13 to -218 (+1 is the 1st nucleotide of the structural gene). The probe was generated by PCR using C. japonicus as the template DNA and primers, listed in supplemental material, labeled at the 5′ end with IRDye® 700 (IRD; synthesized by MWG Biotec). The corresponding unlabeled probe was generated in the same way but using primers without the infra-red label. Double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors were produced from complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide pairs (supplemental material) by annealing at 96 °C for 10 min in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm NaCl and 1 mm EDTA. AbfR (0.1–1 μg), IRD-labeled probe (5–7.5 ng), and where appropriate, double-stranded oligonucleotide competitors (200-fold excess) or other competitors at a 100-fold excess were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The mixture was then loaded onto a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide-TBE gel and electrophoresed for 90–120 min at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE buffer. Images were captured using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).Enzyme Assays—To assess the capacity of the isolated transposon mutants to synthesize plant cell wall hydrolases, the selected strains were cultured on minimal media in which the sole carbon sources were wheat arabinoxylan, hydroxyethylcellulose, and carob galactomannan, respectively, at a concentration of 0.2%. At late exponential phase/early stationary phase, the culture supernatant and the harvested cells were assayed for acetyl and ferulate esterase (11Ferreira L.M. Wood T.M. Williamson G. Faulds C.

Affinity gel electrophoresis was based on the method of Ref. 29Tomme P. Creagh A.L. Kilburn D.G. Haynes C.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13885-13894Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar. Potential polysaccharide ligands were added to the native gel mixture immediately prior to polymerization at a concentration of 0.1%. In the fluorescence spectrometry method, the 2.5-ml reaction consisted of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 1.0 μm AbfSSD and potential ligands at a concentration ranging from 0 to 1.5 mm for oligosaccharides and 0–1 mg ml-1 for polysaccharides. After thorough mixing the protein was excited at 280 nm, and the emission spectrum was scanned from 290 to 450 nm. The fluorescence data were fitted to a single site model using nonlinear regression to determine the dissociation constant (KD).Sequence Comparison Analysis—Proteins were screened for sequence similarity within the Pfam data base (Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute) using the HMMER2 suit of programs. The output for the probability that two proteins, or sequence motifs, are related are given as Hidden Markov Model (HMM) scores (bits) and expectation values. An HMM score is related to the log base 2 of the probability of the alignment to the model divided by the probability of the sequence matching because of the “randomness of amino acid sequence.” Thus a score of 100 bits means it is 2100-fold more likely that the sequence is a match to the model rather than because of a random event. The expectation or e score is the number of different alignments with scores equivalent to or better than a score that is expected to occur by chance. The lower the E value, the more significant the score.Crystallization of AbfSSD—Crystallization conditions for native AbfSSD were obtained by sparse-matrix screening at 20 °C using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion technique. The best native crystals grew from AbfSSD solutions at a concentration of 21.5 mg/ml mixed with 0.9 m KH2PO4, and although this solution was buffered with 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, the actual pH of the crystallization mother liquor was ∼6.0. Although selenomethionyl-AbfS at 18.7 mg/ml also crystallized from phosphate-containing solutions, isomorphous crystals that were subsequently used for data collection were actually obtained from 1.8 m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5. All crystals were prepared for data collection by adding glucose to 30% saturation to the crystallization mother liquor. Crystals were flash-cooled by plunge-freezing into liquid nitrogen before being mounted for x-ray diffraction data collection.AbfSSD Structure Determination—The crystals of AbfSSD belong to the primitive orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions a = 107.8 Å, b = 80.0 Å, c = 102.0 Å. Additional crystal statistics are indicated in Table 1. For phasing purposes, diffraction data from crystals of native and selenomethionyl-substituted AbfSSD were collected, each to a maximum resolution of 3.0 Å resolution, on beamlines BM14 and ID14-EH3 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, respectively. The diffraction data were processed and scaled using MOSFLM (30Leslie A.G.W. Joint CCCP4+ESF-EAMCB Newsletter Protein Crystallography Number 26.

DJ-1 is a soluble dimeric protein with critical roles in response to oxidative stress and in neuronal maintenance. However, several lines of evidence suggest the existence of a nonfunctional aggregated form of DJ-1 in the brain of patients with some neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we show that inorganic phosphate, an important anion that exhibits elevated levels in patients with Parkinson disease, transforms DJ-1 into filamentous aggregates. According to the 2.4-Å crystal structure, DJ-1 dimers are linearly stacked through Pi-mediated interactions to form protofilaments, which are then bundled into a filamentous assembly.

According to the 2.4-Å crystal structure, DJ-1 dimers are linearly stacked through Pi-mediated interactions to form protofilaments, which are then bundled into a filamentous assembly. Human DJ-1 is a 189-amino acid, homo-dimeric protein. It was first identified as a novel candidate for the oncogene product that transformed mouse NIH3T3 cells in concert with activated ras (1Nagakubo D. Taira T. Kitaura H. Ikeda M. Tamai K. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). After this initial identification, DJ-1 has been shown to have various physiological implications. DJ-1 was characterized as a protein that regulates an RNA-protein interaction (2Hod Y. Pentyala S.N. Whyard T.C. El-Maghrabi M.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 72: 435-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and positively modulates the androgen receptor (3Takahashi K. Taira T. Niki T. Seino C.

In addition to functions in somatic cells, DJ-1 seems to play roles in male fertility. CAP-1, or SP22, a rat homologue of DJ-1, has been identified as a key protein related to infertility observed in male rats that were exposed to sperm toxicants (4Klinefelter G.R. Laskey J.W.

DJ-1 began to attract attention after a homozygous deletion in the DJ-1 gene was revealed to be responsible for the autosomal recessive early onset Parkinson disease (PD) 3The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; EM, electron micrograph(s). 3The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; EM, electron micrograph(s).

Like the deletion mutation, several missense mutations of the DJ-1 gene found in inherited PD cases also appear to cause a complete lack of DJ-1 function. For example, the L166P mutation appears to destabilize the dimeric structure of DJ-1 by promoting the unfolding of its C-terminal region, subsequently enhancing its degradation via the proteasome system and leading to the loss of DJ-1 in cells (8Miller D.W.

Activated DJ-1 inhibits α-synuclein aggregation, the major component of Lewy bodies, which are the characteristic intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions in PD and are closely associated with the progression of PD. DJ-1 also acts as a redox-sensitive negative regulator of apoptosis. DJ-1 contributes to the activation of the PI3K/Akt survival signaling pathway (13Yang Y. Gehrke S. Haque M.E. Imai Y. Kosek J.

Thus far, three structural modifications of the DJ-1 dimeric structure have been reported. First, DJ-1 is sumoylated at lysine residue 130 by PIASxα. Proper sumoylation is thought to be essential in ras-dependent cellular transformation, cell growth promotion, and anti-UV-induced apoptosis (21Shinbo Y. Niki T. Taira T. Ooe H. Takahashi-Niki K.

Second, a cysteine residue (Cys106) of DJ-1 is oxidized to sulfinic acid under oxidative stress conditions (11Lee S.J. Kim S.J. Kim I.K. Ko J. Jeong C.S. Kim G.H. Park C. Kang S.O. Suh P.G. Lee H.S.

In addition, a C106A mutant fails to prevent cell death against oxidative stress, indicating the importance of oxidation at Cys106 for DJ-1 function (22Canet-Aviles R.M. Wilson M.A. Miller D.W.

In addition, insoluble DJ-1 is dramatically increased in brains of sporadic PD patients (28Moore D.J. Zhang L. Troncoso J. Lee M.K. Hattori N. Mizuno Y. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Hum. Mol.

These findings suggest that abnormal aggregation of DJ-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we report biochemical and structural investigations of DJ-1 aggregates formed in a Pi-dependent manner. Purification of DJ-1—The DJ-1 gene (encoding residues 1–189) was amplified, inserted into pET-21a (Novagen) and introduced into Escherichia coli strain B834 (DE3), and tDJ-1 was purified as described (11Lee S.J. Kim S.J. Kim I.K. Ko J. Jeong C.S. Kim G.H. Park C. Kang S.O. Suh P.G. Lee H.S. Cha S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44552-44559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For purification of pDJ-1, the cells were grown to an A600 of ∼0.7 in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.1 mg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and the expression of DJ-1 was induced by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. After 4-h induction at 37 °C, the cells were harvested and resuspended in sodium phosphate buffers (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. The cells were disrupted by sonication, and the cell debris was discarded by centrifugation. The supernatants were loaded on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Novagen) and eluted with sodium phosphate butters containing 20 mm imidazole. The eluted fraction was loaded on a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient in sodium phosphate buffers (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm dithiothreitol. Dynamic Light Scattering—Measurements were taken at 22 °C using a DynaPro instrument (Protein Solutions Inc.) equipped with a thermostatted cell. DJ-1 in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (tDJ-1), and DJ-1 in sodium phosphate, pH 7.5 (pDJ-1), at concentrations of 1 mg/ml were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. 60 μl of the supernatants were added to the cuvette, and the light scattering intensity was collected 30 times at an angle of 90° using a 10-s acquisition time. Data analyses were performed using the Dynapro V.5 software. Circular Dichroism—CD experiments were performed on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.2-cm-path length cell, with a 1-nm bandwidth and a 4-s response time. Near-UV CD spectra were collected from 340 to 240 nm with a scan speed of 50 nm/min and 1-nm step resolution. Five individual scans were added and averaged. Electron Microscopy—Purified pDJ-1 in a phosphate buffer condition was diluted and sampled 1 and 3 days after purification. pDJ-1 (0.6 mg/ml) was applied to carbon-coated grids and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. The samples were visualized on a Philips CM30 electron microscope using a TVIPS FastScan-F114T CCD camera at a 47,000× magnification. Crystallization, Data Collection, Model Building, and Refinement—The crystals of pDJ-1 were obtained by vapor diffusion from droplets containing 2 μl of protein solution plus 2 μl of precipitant solution containing 2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.4 m sodium potassium tartrate, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, which were equilibrated against 0.5 ml of the same precipitant solution at 277 K. For data collection, the crystals were frozen at -170 °C using a cryostream cooler (Oxford Cryosystems) after a brief immersion in a cryoprotectant solution containing 20% glycerol in the same mother liquor. A 2.4 Å data set was collected at beamline 5A of the Photon Factory (Table 1). The data were integrated and scaled using HKL2000. The crystal structure of DJ-1 was determined by molecular replacement using AMoRe. Refinement was done with a maximum likelihood algorithm implemented in CNS program (Table 1). Molecular graphic manipulations were performed with QUANTA software (Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA.). After completing the adjustment of side chains according to electron density, the model was subjected to a positional refinement, causing the R value to decrease to 27.2%. At this stage, water molecules were added using the X-solvate utility of QUANTA, and Pi was incorporated into the corresponding density. The subsequent refinement and manual refitting of model reduced R and Rfree values to 23.4 and 28.7%, respectively. The ideality of the model stereochemistry was verified by PROCHECK. The Ramachandran plot indicates 90.1% of nonglycine, and nonproline residues are in the most favored regions in the final model.TABLE 1Summary of crystallographic analysisData collection Space groupC2 Unit cell (Å)a = 193.62, b = 102.58, c = 85.54, β = 113.7° Wavelength (Å)1.12714 Resolution (Å)50-2.4 Rsym (%)aThe values for the highest shells are given in parentheses,bRsym = ΣhΣI|Ih,i – Ih|/ΣhΣIIh,i, where Ih is the mean intensity of the i observations of symmetry related reflections of h8.1 (34) Average I/σ16.5 (4.7) Completeness (≥3σ) (%)98.62 (97.8) Total reflections170,172 Unique reflections56,724Refinement (F > 0 σ) Resolution (Å)50-2.4 R/Rfree (%)cr = Σ|Fo – Fc|/ΣFo, where Fo = Fp, and Fc is the calculated protein structure factor from the atomic model.

During efforts to obtain aggregated DJ-1, we were aware that brain cells of PD, multiple system atrophy, and Alzheimer disease patients where DJ-1 aggregation has been observed also contain elevated levels of inorganic phosphate, a vital molecule involved in almost all metabolic processes (34Barbiroli B. Martinelli P. Patuelli A. Lodi R. Iotti S. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Mov. Disord. 1999; 14: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Brown G.G. Levine S.R. Gorell J.M. Pettegrew J.W. Gdowski J.W. Bueri J.A. Helpern J.A. Welch K.M. Neurology. 1989; 39: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). High Pi levels in serum are directly related to some diseases (36Dhingra R. Sullivan L.M. Fox C.S. Wang T.J. D'Agostino Sr., R.B. Gaziano J.M. Vasan R.S. Arch. Intern Med. 2007; 167: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested sodium phosphate buffers containing Pi to set an environment favorable for formation of DJ-1 aggregates, instead of Tris buffers, which had been previously used to purify recombinant DJ-1 (11Lee S.J. Kim S.J. Kim I.K. Ko J. Jeong C.S. Kim G.H. Park C. Kang S.O. Suh P.G. Lee H.S. Cha S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44552-44559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For easy, effective analysis of aggregation, we performed dynamic light scattering measurements. DJ-1 purified using sodium phosphate buffers (pDJ-1) exhibited a very interesting feature compared with DJ-1 purified using Tris buffers (tDJ-1). tDJ-1 showed a hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of 2.92 nm, representing the dimeric conformation with a molecular mass of ∼40 kDa, whereas pDJ-1 had an Rh of 41.04 nm, a clear indication of aggregates (Fig. 1A). The pDJ-1 proteins purified with sodium phosphate buffers of different concentrations were subjected to dynamic light scattering to determine the effect of Pi concentration on DJ-1 aggregation. Interestingly, DJ-1 aggregates with large Rh were detected over 2 mm sodium phosphate buffers, which is a concentration comparable with the elevated Pi levels in the brains of PD patients (34Barbiroli B. Martinelli P. Patuelli A. Lodi R. Iotti S. Cortelli P. Montagna P. Mov. Disord. 1999; 14: 430-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Brown G.G. Levine S.R. Gorell J.M. Pettegrew J.W. Gdowski J.W. Bueri J.A. Helpern J.A. Welch K.M. Neurology. 1989; 39: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed time dependence of DJ-1 aggregation in buffers of low Pi concentration. Fresh pDJ-1 purified with 20–50 mm sodium phosphate buffers exhibited large Rh values. In contrast, fresh pDJ-1 in 2–10 mm sodium phosphate buffers exhibited Rh of the dimeric conformation; they showed large Rh values in a time-dependent manner. For example, pDJ-1 purified with a 2 mm sodium phosphate buffer began to display large Rh values 15 days after purification. It should be noted that tDJ-1 has the dimeric Rh value even 15 days after purification. The structural differences between tDJ-1 and pDJ-1 are also reflected in a near-UV CD spectrum (Fig. 1B). The near-UV CD spectrum of a protein provides a valuable fingerprint of the tertiary structure of proteins, which can be used to compare protein structures (37Kelly S.M. Jess T.J. Price N.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1751: 119-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2317) Google Scholar). Structural Investigation of DJ-1 Aggregates—To elucidate the structural property of DJ-1 aggregates, we employed electron microscopy. Because it takes a long time for pDJ-1 in buffers of low Pi concentration to form aggregates, we used pDJ-1 purified with a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer for structural studies. Electron micrographs (EM) of pDJ-1 solutions were obtained on the first 3 days after purification. EM revealed that DJ-1 aggregates have a filamentous shape that gets longer and thicker with time (Fig. 2). The time dependence of DJ-1 aggregates is consistent with the dynamic light scattering results. The low resolution of EM limits structural information on DJ-1 filamentous aggregates. Thus, to obtain an atomic view of DJ-1 aggregates, we grew pDJ-1 crystals. The rod-shaped crystals of pDJ-1 exhibit a filamentous arrangement of DJ-1 molecules. Three DJ-1 dimers and one monomer, which are stacked, exist in an asymmetric unit. The monomer becomes a dimer via the 2-fold crystallographic symmetry. Consequently, continuous stacking of DJ-1 dimers is achieved, resulting in the formation of straight protofilaments (Fig. 3, A and B). Protofilaments are further packed in a side-by-side manner, organized in a filamentous assembly (Fig. 4A).FIGURE 3Structure of DJ-1. A, ribbon diagram of a DJ-1 dimer in the reference orientation. IxL and IxR stand for the left and right monomers of an Ix dimer in this orientation, respectively. To distinguish monomers in the dimer, IxL is covered with transparent surface.

The rotational axis of this conformation coincides with the protofilament axis (Fig. 3A), giving the protofilaments the appearance of circular cylinders when viewed from above (Fig. 4A). The top side of a DJ-1 dimer makes tight contact with the bottom side of the next dimer, displaying a ∼103° (720°/7) rotational difference (Fig. 3A). As a result, the I7 dimer exhibits the same orientation as the I0 dimer after 720° rotation; hence, the seven (from I0 to I6) dimers constitute one longitudinal repeat unit of DJ-1 protofilaments (Fig. 3B). No detectable structural differences were observed among the dimers stacked in the protofilaments. In addition, the dimers in the protofilaments are nearly structurally identical to free DJ-1 dimers (11Lee S.J. Kim S.J. Kim I.K. Ko J. Jeong C.S. Kim G.H. Park C. Kang S.O. Suh P.G. Lee H.S. Cha S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44552-44559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar); their backbone atoms align with an root mean square deviation of 0.175 Å. The contacts between dimers in the protofilaments, hereafter referred to as “F contacts,” bury 1809 Å2 of the solvent-accessible surface area of a DJ-1 dimer. A closer look at the F interfaces reveals their inherent 2-fold symmetry, as well as three major F contacts along the 2-fold axis: ion pairs, a hydrophobic core, and Pi-mediated contacts (Fig. 3, D and E). Because all of the F interfaces in protofilaments are identical, we describe only one F interface, which is located between the I0 and I1 dimers. Lys130 and Glu143 of the I0L monomer form ion pairs with Glu143 and Lys130 of the I1R monomer, respectively. Pro127 and Leu128 from the I0L monomer and I1R monomer, coupled with Pro184 from the I0R and I1L monomers, form the hydrophobic core. Two Pis, related by the F 2-fold axis, take positions at the F interface, mediating extensive contact: one is located between the I0L and I1L monomers (LPi), and the other is located between the I0R and I1R monomers (RPi) (Fig. 3, C–E). LPi directly forms polar interactions with the guanidium group of Arg48 and the amide nitrogen of Asn76 in the I0L monomer and makes a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Gln180 in the I1L monomer. RPi is coordinated in an identical fashion. Because the guanidium group of Arg48 participates in coordinating Pi (Fig. 3, C–E), its elimination would prevent the binding of Pi at the F interfaces, affecting the formation of filamentous aggregates. To establish the role of Pi as an inducer of filamentous aggregates, we generated a R48A mutant. The mutant exhibits an Rh of 2.75 nm even in a high Pi concentration (Fig. 1A), pointing to the critical role of Pi in DJ-1 aggregation. Protofilaments run parallel with one another in crystals. Although one protofilament is surrounded by six others, two of these do not actually contact the central protofilament (Fig. 4A, bottom panel), thus displaying a parallelogram pattern when viewed from the top (Fig. 4A, top panel). The lateral interactions between protofilaments exhibit good geometric complementarities, such that prominence regions in protofilaments fit into grooves in adjacent protofilaments (Fig. 4B). The I0L and I6L monomers function as prominences, and the grooves participating in these lateral interactions are located both between the I1R and I2L monomers and between the I4R and I5L monomers (Fig. 3B). Consequently, four lateral contact sites are located in each longitudinal repeat unit of a protofilament. Each site in a longitudinal repeat unit interacts with one of the surrounding protofilaments, and thus each longitudinal repeat unit makes contact with four protofilaments. The lateral interface between a prominence and"

Mutations in the G-CSFR in patients with severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) transforming to acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) have been shown to induce hypersensitivity and enhanced growth responses to G-CSF. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in the initiation of negative signaling by the G-CSFR. To further investigate the role of ubiquitination in regulating G-CSFR signaling, we generated a mutant form of the G-CSFR (K762R/G-CSFR) which abrogates the attachment of ubiquitin to the lysine residue at position 762 of the G-CSFR that is deleted in the Δ716 G-CSFR form isolated from patients with SCN/AML. In response to G-CSF, mono-/polyubiquitination of the G-CSFR was impaired in cells expressing the mutant K762R/G-CSFR compared to cells transfected with the WT G-CSFR. Cells stably transfected with the K762R/G-CSFR displayed a higher proliferation rate, increased sensitivity to G-CSF, and enhanced survival following cytokine depletion, similar to previously published data with the Δ716 G-CSFR mutant. Activation of the signaling molecules Stat5 and Akt were also increased in K762R/G-CSFR transfected cells in response to G-CSF, and their activation remained prolonged after G-CSF withdrawal. These results indicate that ubiquitination is required for regulation of G-CSFR-mediated proliferation and cell survival. Mutations that disrupt G-CSFR ubiquitination at lysine 762 induce aberrant receptor signaling and hyperproliferative responses to G-CSF, which may contribute to leukemic transformation."
https://openalex.org/W1997845865,"Creating transition-state mimics has proven to be a powerful strategy in developing inhibitors to treat malignant diseases in several cases. In the present study, structurally diverse coenzyme-substrate derivatives mimicking this type for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent human ornithine decarboxylase (hODC), a potential anticancer target, were designed, synthesized, and tested to elucidate the structural requirements for optimal inhibition of intracellular ODC as well as of tumor cell proliferation. Of 23 conjugates, phosphopyridoxyl- and pyridoxyl-L-tryptophan methyl ester (pPTME, PTME) proved significantly more potent in suppression proliferation (IC(50) up to 25 microM) of glioma cells (LN229) than alpha-DL-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a medically used irreversible inhibitor of ODC. In agreement with molecular modeling predictions, the inhibitory action of pPTME and PTME toward intracellular ODC of LN229 cells exceeded that of the previous designed lead compound POB. The inhibitory active compounds feature hydrophobic side chain fragments and a kind of polyamine motif (-NH-(CH(X))(4)-NH-). In addition, they induce, as polyamine analogs often do, the activity of the polyamine catabolic enzymes polyamine oxidase and spermine/spermidine N(1)-acetyltransferase up to 250 and 780%, respectively. The dual-action mode of these compounds in LN229 cells affects the intracellular polyamine metabolism and might underlie the more favorable cell proliferation inhibition in comparison with DFMO."
https://openalex.org/W1998182514,"Background In the field of neuroscience microarray gene expression profiles on anatomically defined brain structures are being used increasingly to study both normal brain functions as well as pathological states. Fluorescent tracing techniques in brain tissue that identifies distinct neuronal populations can in combination with global gene expression profiling potentially increase the resolution and specificity of such studies to shed new light on neuronal functions at the cellular level. Methodology/Principal Findings We examine the microarray gene expression profiles of two distinct neuronal populations in the spinal cord of the neonatal rat, the principal motor neurons and specific interneurons involved in motor control. The gene expression profiles of the respective cell populations were obtained from amplified mRNA originating from 50–250 fluorescently identified and laser microdissected cells. In the data analysis we combine a new microarray normalization procedure with a conglomerate measure of significant differential gene expression. Using our methodology we find 32 genes to be more expressed in the interneurons compared to the motor neurons that all except one have not previously been associated with this neuronal population. As a validation of our method we find 17 genes to be more expressed in the motor neurons than in the interneurons and of these only one had not previously been described in this population. Conclusions/Significance We provide an optimized experimental protocol that allows isolation of gene transcripts from fluorescent retrogradely labeled cell populations in fresh tissue, which can be used to generate amplified aRNA for microarray hybridization from as few as 50 laser microdissected cells. Using this optimized experimental protocol in combination with our microarray analysis methodology we find 49 differentially expressed genes between the motor neurons and the interneurons that reflect the functional differences between these two cell populations in generating and transmitting the motor output in the rodent spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2050889324,"Background Mimicry, in which one prey species (the Mimic) imitates the aposematic signals of another prey (the Model) to deceive their predators, has attracted the general interest of evolutionary biologists. Predator psychology, especially how the predator learns and forgets, has recently been recognized as an important factor in a predator–prey system. This idea is supported by both theoretical and experimental evidence, but is also the source of a good deal of controversy because of its novel prediction that in a Model/Mimic relationship even a moderately unpalatable Mimic increases the risk of the Model (quasi-Batesian mimicry). Methodology/Principal Findings We developed a psychology-based Monte Carlo model simulation of mimicry that incorporates a “Pavlovian” predator that practices an optimal foraging strategy, and examined how various ecological and psychological factors affect the relationships between a Model prey species and its Mimic. The behavior of the predator in our model is consistent with that reported by experimental studies, but our simulation's predictions differed markedly from those of previous models of mimicry because a more abundant Mimic did not increase the predation risk of the Model when alternative prey were abundant. Moreover, a quasi-Batesian relationship emerges only when no or very few alternative prey items were available. Therefore, the availability of alternative prey rather than the precise method of predator learning critically determines the relationship between Model and Mimic. Moreover, the predation risk to the Model and Mimic is determined by the absolute density of the Model rather than by its density relative to that of the Mimic. Conclusions/Significance Although these predictions are counterintuitive, they can explain various kinds of data that have been offered in support of competitive theories. Our model results suggest that to understand mimicry in nature it is important to consider the likely presence of alternative prey and the possibility that predation pressure is not constant."
https://openalex.org/W1975213966,"Background Studies of wild animals responding to their native parasites are essential if we are to understand how the immune system functions in the natural environment. While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. Methodology/Principal Findings We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). Conclusions/Significance Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding."
