A cost-effective synthetic scheme for transforming CO 2 into fuels and commodity chemicals would be a double boon, lowering atmospheric concentration of the greenhouse gas while supplementing (and perhaps ultimately replacing) dwindling petroleum feedstocks. Toward this end, Costentin et al. (p. 90 ) show that an iron catalyst for the electrochemical reduction of CO 2 to CO gets an efficiency boost from phenol substituents appended to the ligand framework."

Some people develop trauma-related psychological disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression; others develop mild to moderate psychological symptoms that resolve rapidly; still others report no new psychological symptoms in response to traumatic stress. Individual variability in how animals and humans respond to stress and trauma depends on numerous genetic, developmental, cognitive, psychological, and neurobiological risk and protective factors."

Over 5 years of pesticide treatment, the production of defensive chemicals in the fruit reduced and flowering times shifted, and the primrose's competitive ability against dandelions improved. Züst et al.

Thus, herbivory has strong and immediate effects on the local genotypic composition of plants and traits associated with herbivore resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2001160077,"Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradation system conserved among eukaryotes. The mammalian Atg1 homologues, Unc-51 like kinase (ULK) 1 and 2, are multifunctional proteins with roles in autophagy, neurite outgrowth, and vesicle transport. The mammalian ULK complex involved in autophagy consists of ULK1, ULK2, ATG13, FIP200, and ATG101. We have used pulldown and peptide array overlay assays to study interactions between the ULK complex and six different ATG8 family proteins. Strikingly, in addition to ULK1 and ULK2, ATG13 and FIP200 interacted with human ATG8 proteins, all with strong preference for the GABARAP subfamily. Similarly, yeast and Drosophila Atg1 interacted with their respective Atg8 proteins, demonstrating the evolutionary conservation of the interaction. Use of peptide arrays allowed precise mapping of the functional LIR motifs, and two-dimensional scans of the ULK1 and ATG13 LIR motifs revealed which substitutions that were tolerated. This information, combined with an analysis of known LIR motifs, provides us with a clearer picture of sequence requirements for LIR motifs. In addition to the known requirements of the aromatic and hydrophobic residues of the core motif, we found the interactions to depend strongly on acidic residues surrounding the central core LIR motifs. A preference for either a hydrophobic residue or an acidic residue following the aromatic residue in the LIR motif is also evident. Importantly, the LIR motif is required for starvation-induced association of ULK1 with autophagosomes. Our data suggest that ATG8 proteins act as scaffolds for assembly of the ULK complex at the phagophore."
https://openalex.org/W2042897772,"Telomerase activation through induction of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) contributes to malignant transformation by stabilizing telomeres. Clinical studies demonstrate that higher hTERT expression is associated with cancer progression and poor outcomes, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Because epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) are key factors in cancer metastasis and relapse, and hTERT has been shown to exhibit multiple biological activities independently of its telomere-lengthening function, we address a potential role of hTERT in EMT and CSCs using gastric cancer (GC) as a model. hTERT overexpression promotes, whereas its inhibition suppresses, EMT and stemness of GC cells, respectively. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 and β-catenin-mediated EMT was abolished by small interfering RNA depletion of hTERT expression. hTERT interacts with β-catenin, enhances its nuclear localization and transcriptional activity, and occupies the β-catenin target vimentin promoter. All these hTERT effects were independent of its telomere-lengthening function or telomerase activity. hTERT and EMT marker expression correlates positively in GC samples. Mouse experiments demonstrate the in vivo stimulation of hTERT on cancer cell colonization. Collectively, hTERT stimulates EMT and induces stemness of cancer cells, thereby promoting cancer metastasis and recurrence. Thus, targeting hTERT may prevent cancer progression by inhibiting EMT and CSCs."

Recording from multiple electrodes in the rat medial prefrontal cortex, Karlsson et al. (p. 135 ) investigated how ensembles of neurons changed their activity during the performance of a task in which the animal had to update its knowledge of reward contingencies. The results suggest that changes in perceived action-outcome contingencies were associated with abrupt switches in neuronal representations in the rat medial prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2003624918,"Epithelial ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecological malignancy in the Western world. A major impediment for the successful treatment is the development of drug resistance. The molecular processes that contribute to resistance have been extensively studied; however, there is not much known about regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs). We compared miRNA expression profiles of an isogenic cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant ovarian cancer cell line pair (A2780/A2780 DDP) and found 27 miRNAs to be differentially expressed (⩾2-fold). Five of these, including the family members miR-141/200c, showed a correlation with cisplatin sensitivity in the NCI-60 panel. Overexpression of miR-141 resulted in enhanced resistance to cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines. We next correlated the expression level of miR-141 in 132 primary ovarian tumors (108 serous and 24 non-serous) with response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Although no differences were observed in the serous tumors, miR-141 levels were higher in non-serous ovarian tumors that did not respond well to therapy (platinum-free interval <6 months). We demonstrate that miR-141 directly targets KEAP1, and that downregulation of KEAP1 induces cisplatin resistance. Conversely, overexpression of KEAP1 significantly enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Expression of KEAP1 with its 3′-UTR, and a 3′-UTR in which the miR-141 target site has been mutated, revealed that miR-141 regulates KEAP1 upon exposure to cisplatin. Finally, we show that the NF-κB pathway, which can be regulated by KEAP1, is activated upon miR-141 overexpression, and that inhibition of this pathway partially reverses miR-141-mediated cisplatin resistance. These findings demonstrate that the miR-141-mediated regulation of KEAP1 has a crucial role in the cellular response to cisplatin."

Using data from the Keck Observatory, Meyer et al. (p. 84 ) detected a star orbiting this black hole with a period of 11.5 years, the shortest period among the stars orbiting it. The star is the second well-sampled star with an orbital period under 20 years. Having detailed knowledge about two stars with short periods and full orbit coverage will be crucial in testing Einstein's theory of general relativity in the gravitational field close to a massive black hole."

(p. 124 ) now observe that some of the neural mechanisms that regulate opiate reward can be both different and even opposite to those that regulate reward by stimulant drugs. While knockdown of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ventral tegmental area in mice antagonized the response to cocaine, the same manipulation strengthened the potential of opiates to increase dopamine neuron excitability. Optogenetic stimulation of dopaminergic terminals in the nucleus accumbens could counteract the effects of BDNF on morphine reward blockade."

A harder problem to study is when the transition occurs uniformly. Wang et al. (p. 87 ; see the Perspective by Weeks ) imaged the homogeneous melting of superheated colloidal crystals using a laser to initiate the melting at the interior of the crystal. The authors were then able to track nucleation precursors and nucleus evolution and to find where defects and instabilities limited the homogeneous melting process."

There are two major competing models: the goodsbased model and the action-based model of value. Leathers and Olson (p. 132 ) designed a critical experiment to decide between these two views. In the monkey brain, lateral intraparietal neurons responded strongly to stimuli predicting both large rewards and large penalties, encoding the salience of the stimulus rather than reward value, which refutes both models."
https://openalex.org/W1986383197,"The skeleton is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer, with bone metastasis causing pain as well as risk of pathological fractures. Interaction between tumors and the bone microenvironment creates a vicious cycle that accelerates both bone destruction and cancer progression. This study is the first to analyze the soluble factors secreted by breast tumor-associated osteoblasts (TAOBs), which are responsible for promoting cancer progression. The addition of CXCL5 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 5), present in large amounts in TAOB-condition medium (TAOB-CM), mimicked the inductive effect of TAOB-CM on breast cancer epithelial–mesenchymal transition, migration and invasion. In contrast, inhibition of CXCL5 in OBs decreased TAOB-mediated cancer progression. Inducement of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cancer progression by TAOB-derived CXCL5 is associated with increased Raf/MEK/ERK activation, and mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1) and Elk-1 phosphorylation, as well as Snail upregulation. Activation of Elk-1 facilitates recruitment of phosphorylated MSK1, which in turn enhances histone H3 acetylation and phosphorylation (serine 10) of Snail promoter, resulting in Snail enhancement and E-cadherin downregulation. Moreover, mice treated with anti-CXCL5 antibodies showed decreased metastasis of 4T1 breast cancer cells. Our study suggests that inhibition of CXCL5-mediated ERK/Snail signaling is an attractive therapeutic target for treating metastases in breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W2142436130,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed and activated in many human cancers and predicts poor patient prognosis. Targeting the kinase domain with specific EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) like gefitinib and erlotinib has been used in anticancer treatments. However, patient response rates in different human cancers were initially low. Only a subgroup of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring EGFR-activating mutations responds to EGFR TKI treatment, but most of these responders relapse and acquire resistance. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that MET proto-oncogene overexpression correlates with resistance to EGFR TKI treatment. Similarly to MET overexpression, the tumor microenvironment-derived ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was shown to activate Met and thereby induce short-term resistance to EGFR TKI treatment in gefitinib-sensitive NSCLC cell lines in vitro. However, only little is known about the HGF/Met-induced EGFR TKI resistance mechanism in other human cancer types. Therefore, in order to develop possible new anticancer strategies for diverse human cancers, we screened 12 carcinoma cell lines originating from the breast, kidney, liver and tongue for HGF-induced EGFR tyrosine kinase (TK)-inhibition. In addition, in order to advance our understanding of a TK-inactive EGFR, we used EGFR co-immunoprecipitation, followed by mass spectrometry to identify novel HGF-induced EGFR binding partners, which are potentially involved in tyrosine kinase-independent EGFR signaling mechanisms. Here we show for the first time that HGF-induced EGFR TK-inhibition is a very common mechanism in human cancers, and that the kinase-inactive EGFR directly interacts with and stabilizes several cancer-relevant proteins, including the receptor tyrosine kinases Axl and EphA2, and the CUB domain-containing protein-1. This study has strong implications for the development of new anticancer strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2047844649,"Regulation of cell survival is a key part of the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling has been implicated in MM pathogenesis, but its function is unclear. To elucidate the role of JNK in MM, we evaluated the specific functions of the two major JNK proteins, JNK1 and JNK2. We show here that JNK2 is constitutively activated in a panel of MM cell lines and primary tumors. Using loss-of-function studies, we demonstrate that JNK2 is required for the survival of myeloma cells and constitutively suppresses JNK1-mediated apoptosis by affecting expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)14, a key regulator of B-cell survival. Strikingly, we found that PARP14 is highly expressed in myeloma plasma cells and associated with disease progression and poor survival. Overexpression of PARP14 completely rescued myeloma cells from apoptosis induced by JNK2 knockdown, indicating that PARP14 is critically involved in JNK2-dependent survival. Mechanistically, PARP14 was found to promote the survival of myeloma cells by binding and inhibiting JNK1. Moreover, inhibition of PARP14 enhances the sensitization of MM cells to anti-myeloma agents. Our findings reveal a novel regulatory pathway in myeloma cells through which JNK2 signals cell survival via PARP14, and identify PARP14 as a potential therapeutic target in myeloma."

Hadrosaurid, or duck-billed, dinosaurs also possessed complex teeth, but how this was achieved has been unknown because reptiles typically possess simple teeth. Erickson et al. (p. 98 ) show how Hadrosaurs evolved teeth composed of six tissues, which allowed for the development of tooth complexity rivaling, or exceeding, that of modern herbivorous mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1972748461,"Non–bilayer-forming lipids such as cardiolipin, phosphatidic acid, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are proposed to generate negative membrane curvature, promoting membrane fusion. However, the mechanism by which lipids regulate mitochondrial fusion remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mitochondrial-localized Psd1, the key yeast enzyme that synthesizes PE, is required for proper mitochondrial morphology and fusion. Yeast cells lacking Psd1 exhibit fragmented and aggregated mitochondria with impaired mitochondrial fusion during mating. More importantly, we demonstrate that a reduction in PE reduces the rate of lipid mixing during fusion of liposomes with lipid compositions reflecting the mitochondrial membrane. This suggests that the mitochondrial fusion defect in the Δpsd1 strain could be due to the altered biophysical properties of the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in reduced fusion kinetics. The Δpsd1 strain also has impaired mitochondrial activity such as oxidative phosphorylation and reduced mitochondrial ATP levels which are due to a reduction in mitochondrial PE. The loss of Psd1 also impairs the biogenesis of s-Mgm1, a protein essential for mitochondrial fusion, further exacerbating the mitochondrial fusion defect of the Δpsd1 strain. Increasing s-Mgm1 levels in Δpsd1 cells markedly reduced mitochondrial aggregation. Our results demonstrate that mitochondrial PE regulates mitochondrial fusion by regulating the biophysical properties of the mitochondrial membrane and by enhancing the biogenesis of s-Mgm1.

After reading basal fluorescence for 5 min, 10 μl of 1.0 m CaCl2 was added to induce liposome fusion. Liposome buffer was used as a negative control, and maximum lipid mixing was determined by adding 10 μl of 10% octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8). Fluorescence was normalized to the initial fluorescence reading and presented as a percentage of maximum lipid mixing. Cells were grown to log phase in rich galactose medium. 3 × 107 cells were harvested per reading, pelleted, and resuspended in 1 ml of fresh fully oxygenated medium for oxygen consumption measurements using a Clark-type oxygen electrode (Strathkelvin Instruments). 100% ethanol was added to a final concentration of 1% (v/v). After the rate of oxygen consumption stabilized, 2 mm carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone was added to a final concentration of 8 μm to induce maximum oxygen consumption. Cells were grown to log phase in 50 ml of rich galactose medium, and mitochondria were purified as described by Gregg et al. with slight modifications (20Gregg C. Kyryakov P. Titorenko V.I. Purification of mitochondria from yeast cells.J. Vis. Exp. 2009; : e1417PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after mitochondrial enrichment, pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of resuspension buffer (homogenization buffer without BSA) and gently homogenized three times with a tight Dounce. Suspensions were then pelleted at 3,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to pellet mitochondria. Mitochondrial purity was assessed by Western blotting. Purified mitochondria were resuspended in 15 μl of 5.5% TCA, 2 mm EDTA and incubated on ice for 10 min to extract ATP and precipitate mitochondrial proteins. Extracted ATP was separated from precipitated proteins by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants containing ATP were collected for ATP measurements using an ATP Determination kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Precipitated proteins were washed twice with ice-cold acetone and heated at 95 °C for 5 min to fully evaporate the acetone. Pellets were then resuspended in 15 μl of reducing sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the RC DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Yeast cells were grown to log phase in rich galactose medium. Cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Cells were collected at the indicated time points and lysed by alkaline lysis for Western blot analysis. Lysates from 5 × 106 cells were loaded per sample. Proteins were detected using Mgm1, Fzo1, and Tom40 antisera, gifts from Dr. Jodi Nunnari, Dr. Andreas Reichert, and Dr. Thomas Langer, respectively. To determine whether phospholipid composition plays a role in regulating mitochondrial membrane dynamics, we examined the mitochondrial morphology of the Δpsd1 yeast strain. A previous study demonstrated that the loss of Psd1 results in an alteration in the mitochondrial phospholipid composition when cells were cultured in rich medium with lactate as a carbon source. Despite the altered mitochondrial lipid composition, it was reported that the mitochondrial morphology of these cells was unaffected (21Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and of its several biosynthetic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that Δpsd1 cells cultured in rich medium had mitochondria that are tubular, somewhat similar to that of wild type (WT) (Fig. 1, A and B). However, upon further characterization, we find that 50% of Δpsd1 cells had an intermediate mitochondrial morphology (Fig. 1, A and B) consisting of tubules, but lacking an organized interconnected network that is seen in WT yeast cells. Because rich medium contains additional nutrients that could affect overall lipid metabolism, we cultured cells in minimal medium, supplying only the nutrients necessary for survival. In contrast to cells cultured in rich medium, 85% of Δpsd1 cells cultured in minimal medium had mitochondria that were fragmented and aggregated (Fig. 1, A and B). This result is consistent with recent findings that Psd1 is required for normal mitochondrial morphology (4Kuroda T. Tani M. Moriguchi A. Tokunaga S. Higuchi T. Kitada S. Kuge O. FMP30 is required for the maintenance of a normal cardiolipin level and mitochondrial morphology in the absence of mitochondrial phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis.Mol.

Chem. 2012; 287: 17589-17597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To further define the mitochondrial aggregation phenotype, we performed electron microscopic analysis. Unlike WT mitochondria that are evenly distributed throughout the cytoplasm, Δpsd1 mitochondria were clustered but not fused (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, the inner membrane of Δpsd1 mitochondria was less electron-dense, suggesting possible inner membrane defects (Fig. 1C). Together, these data indicate that Psd1 is required for normal mitochondrial morphology, highlighting the importance of mitochondrial lipid metabolism in maintaining organellar morphology. The clustered mitochondrial phenotype of the Δpsd1 strain resembles that of mitochondrial fusion mutants (22Dimmer K.S. Fritz S. Fuchs F. Messerschmitt M. Weinbach N. Neupert W. Westermann B. Genetic basis of mitochondrial function and morphology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), suggesting that Psd1 might regulate mitochondrial fusion. To assess whether the mitochondrial morphology defect in Δpsd1 cells is due to a defect in mitochondrial fusion, we performed an in vivo mitochondrial fusion assay. During yeast mating, mitochondria fuse, and mitochondrial content mixing of the mating MATa and MATα haploids can be used as an assay to monitor mitochondrial fusion. As a positive control, WT cells had complete mixing of mitochondrial content (Fig. 2, A and B), indicating complete mitochondrial fusion in this assay. In contrast, only 50% of Δpsd1 cells showed complete mitochondrial content mixing whereas the remaining 50% had only partial mixing (Fig. 2, A and B). This result is surprising considering the mitochondrial fragmentation and aggregation in the Δpsd1 strain (Fig. 1B). Nevertheless, the ability of Δpsd1 mitochondria to undergo fusion indicates that Psd1 is not an obligate member of the mitochondrial fusion machinery. However, the partial fusion phenotype strongly implicates Psd1 as an important regulator and that the altered phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane affects in vivo mitochondrial fusion during mating. Impaired mitochondrial fusion of the Δpsd1 strain during yeast mating suggests that the phospholipid composition of the mitochondrial membrane plays an important role in promoting mitochondrial fusion. To assess whether the altered lipid composition affected the biophysical properties of the mitochondrial membrane that could influence mitochondrial fusion, we performed an in vitro liposome fusion assay using liposomes with phospholipid compositions similar to that of WT and Δpsd1 mitochondria (19Bürgermeister M. Birner-Grünberger R. Nebauer R. Daum G. Contribution of different pathways to the supply of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine to mitochondrial membranes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1686: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of CaCl2 to induce fusion, liposomes with phospholipid compositions similar to that of Δpsd1 mitochondria (Δpsd1 liposomes) fused to the same extent as those with compositions similar to that of WT mitochondria (WT liposomes). This indicates that altering the phospholipid composition does not affect the extent to which liposomes fused (Fig. 3A) and is consistent with our in vivo mitochondrial fusion assay that Δpsd1 mitochondria can undergo complete fusion (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the slope of the curve during mixing of Δpsd1 liposomes is different from that of WT liposomes (Fig. 3A). Because the slopes of the curves represent the relative rates of reaction, we analyzed the slopes to determine whether reduced fusion kinetics could contribute to the mitochondrial fusion defect in the Δpsd1 strain. Our analysis indicates that Δpsd1 liposomes have an ∼75% reduction in their rates of lipid mixing compared with WT liposomes (Fig. 3B). Due to the absence of proteins in this assay, our result indicates that changes in the phospholipid content of Δpsd1 mitochondria likely alter the biophysical properties of the mitochondrial membrane, reducing the kinetics of lipid mixing during mitochondrial fusion. To better define the importance of Psd1 in mitochondrial biology, we determined whether Psd1 is required for normal mitochondrial homeostatic functions such as cell growth and mitochondrial bioenergetics. We analyzed cell growth under respiratory conditions, overall rate of oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial ATP levels. Serial dilutions indicate that the Δpsd1 strain grows slower than the WT strain on glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source that necessitates respiration (Fig. 4A). To more quantitatively determine the mitochondrial metabolic defect in the Δpsd1 strain, we analyzed oxidative phosphorylation by examining the rate of oxygen consumed during ethanol metabolism. Our data revealed that the basal rate of oxidative phosphorylation in the Δpsd1 strain is 50% that of the WT strain (Fig. 4B). The mitochondrial uncoupler, carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone was added to determine the maximum activity of the electron transport chain (23Chen H.K. Ji Z.S. Dodson S.E. Miranda R.D. Rosenblum C.I. Reynolds I.J. Freedman S.B. Weisgraber K.H. Huang Y. Mahley R.W. Apolipoprotein E4 domain interaction mediates detrimental effects on mitochondria and is a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5215-5221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The maximum rate of oxidative phosphorylation in the Δpsd1 strain is also 50% that of the WT strain (Fig. 4B). To determine the effect of impaired oxidative phosphorylation on energy production, a key function of mitochondria, we analyzed the amount of ATP in purified mitochondria. Δpsd1 mitochondria had ∼75% of WT mitochondrial ATP levels, indicating that Psd1 is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial ATP (Fig. 4C). Together, these results highlight the importance of Psd1, and likely the phospholipid PE, in regulating crucial mitochondrial components such as the electron transport chain to maintain cellular respiration and energy production. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the major route of PE synthesis is by decarboxylation of phosphatidylserine (PS) by the mitochondrial-localized Psd1 and the secretory pathway-localized Psd2. Exogenously added ethanolamine (Etn) or Etn formed endogenously by lipid metabolism can also be used to synthesize PE via the Kennedy pathway (24Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Biochemistry, cell biology and molecular biology of lipids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Because Psd1-dependent PS decarboxylation is the major route of PE synthesis, the loss of Psd1 results in significantly reduced mitochondrial and cellular PE. It was also reported that supplementing the Δpsd1 strain with exogenous Etn does not significantly increase mitochondrial PE content, indicating that exogenous PE is not efficiently transported to mitochondria (21Birner R. Bürgermeister M. Schneiter R. Daum G. Roles of phosphatidylethanolamine and of its several biosynthetic pathways in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To directly demonstrate that the mitochondrial defects are a result of a reduction in mitochondrial PE, we cultured Δpsd1 cells in medium supplemented with Etn, which should increase extramitochondrial PE via the Kennedy pathway. The Δpsd1 glycerol growth defect is partially rescued in the presence of Etn (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this rescue is independent of mitochondrial bioenergetics. The addition of Etn could not rescue the Δpsd1 oxidative phosphorylation or mitochondrial ATP defects (Fig. 4, B and C). These results strongly indicate that total cellular PE is crucial for growth and that mitochondrial-localized PE is required for efficient mitochondrial bioenergetics. To assess whether mitochondrial PE is important for the maintenance of proper mitochondrial morphology, we analyzed the mitochondrial morphology of Δpsd1 cells expressing mtGFP grown in the presence of Etn as previously described. Under these conditions, 50% of Δpsd1 cells had an intermediate mitochondrial morphology. Mitochondria in these cells, although mostly tubular, were not connected in a network like those of WT cells (Fig. 1, A and B). This resembles the mitochondrial morphology of Δpsd1 cells cultured in rich medium, indicating that Psd1 is required for proper mitochondrial morphology, especially under more stringent, nutrient-limiting growth conditions. Interestingly, it was previously observed that the loss of Psd1 results in altered ratios of l- and s-Mgm1 (25Osman C. Haag M. Potting C. Rodenfels J. Dip P.V. Wieland F.T. Brügger B. Westermann B.

Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 583-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). This could suggest that the mitochondrial morphology defect in Δpsd1 cells is due to altered Mgm1 ratios. Thus, we determined whether the addition of Etn could alter Mgm1 protein ratios. Cells analyzed for their mitochondrial morphology were also harvested for Western blotting using Mgm1-specific antibodies. The r"

HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), the viral gene transcribed from the antisense strand, is consistently expressed in ATL cells and promotes their proliferation. In this study, we found that a Wnt pathway-related protein, disheveled-associating protein with a high frequency of leucine residues (DAPLE), interacts with both HTLV-1 Tax and HBZ. In the presence of DAPLE, Tax activated canonical Wnt signaling. Conversely, HBZ markedly suppressed canonical Wnt activation induced by either Tax/DAPLE or β-catenin. As a mechanism of HBZ-mediated Wnt suppression, we found that HBZ targets lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1, one of the key transcription factors of the pathway, and impairs its DNA-binding ability. We also observed that the canonical Wnt pathway was not activated in HTLV-1-infected cells, whereas the representative of noncanonical Wnt ligand, Wnt5a, which antagonizes canonical Wnt signaling, was overexpressed. HBZ was able to induce Wnt5a transcription by enhancing its promoter activity through the TGF-β pathway. Importantly, knocking down of Wnt5a in ATL cells repressed cellular proliferation and migration. Our results implicate novel roles of HBZ in ATL leukemogenesis through dysregulation of both the canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathways."

ERK5 inhibitor BIX02189 regulates Nrf2 activation in vivo.Identifying ERK5 as a molecular target for regulating flow-mediating Nrf2-dependent gene expression may have significant therapeutic potential for treating atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is often observed in areas where disturbed flow is formed, whereas atheroprotective region is found in areas where steady laminar flow is developed. It has been reported that some genes activated by blood flow play important roles in vascular function and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) has been reported to regulate endothelial integrity and protect from vascular dysfunction and disease under laminar flow. Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) are major transcriptional factors that contribute to anti-atherogenic responses under laminar flow. Implication of ERK5 in laminar flow-mediated regulation of KLF2-dependent gene has been established, whereas the role of ERK5 in laminar flow-mediated activation of Nrf2 pathway has not been addressed yet. In this study, we found that the blockage of ERK5 either by genetic depletion with siRNA or by biochemical inactivation with a specific chemical compound inhibited laminar flow-induced up-regulation of Nrf2-dependent gene expressions, whereas activation of ERK5 increased transcriptional activity and nuclear translocation of Nrf2, which suggests that ERK5 mediates laminar flow-induced up-regulation of Nrf2-dependent gene expression. Further functional studies showed that ERK5 provides protection against oxidative stress-induced cytotoxicity dependent on Nrf2. Molecular interaction between ERK5 and Nrf2 was further induced by laminar flow. Finally, flow-dependent nuclear localization of Nrf2 was inhibited by BIX02189, a specific inhibitor of MEK5, in aorta of mice in vivo. Collectively, these data demonstrate that laminar flow-induced activation of ERK5-Nrf2 signal pathway plays a critical role for anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic mechanism in endothelial cells."

Here we report that hypoxia can elicit these effects in a PERK-dependent manner. The altered fate of IFNAR1 affected by signaling downstream of PERK depends on phosphorylation of eIF2α (eukaryotic translational initiation factor 2-α) and ensuing activation of p38α kinase. Activators of other eIF2α kinases such as PKR or GCN2 (general control nonrepressed-2) are also capable of eliminating IFNAR1 and blunting IFN responses. Modulation of constitutive PKR activity in human breast cancer cells stabilizes IFNAR1 and sensitizes these cells to IFNAR1-dependent anti-tumorigenic effects. Although downregulation of IFNAR1 and impaired IFNAR1 signaling can be elicited in response to amino-acid deficit, the knockdown of GCN2 in melanoma cells reverses these phenotypes. We propose that, in cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, activation of diverse eIF2α kinases followed by IFNAR1 downregulation enables multiple cellular components of tumor tissue to evade the direct and indirect anti-tumorigenic effects of Type 1 IFN."
https://openalex.org/W2094448198,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays a key role in maintaining brain functionality. Although mammalian BBB is formed by endothelial cells, its function requires interactions between endotheliocytes and glia. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved in these interactions is currently a major challenge. We show here that α-dystrobrevin (α-DB), a protein contributing to dystrophin-associated protein scaffolds in astrocytic endfeet, is essential for the formation and functioning of BBB. The absence of α-DB in null brains resulted in abnormal brain capillary permeability, progressively escalating brain edema, and damage of the neurovascular unit. Analyses in situ and in two-dimensional and three-dimensional in vitro models of BBB containing α-DB-null astrocytes demonstrated these abnormalities to be associated with loss of aquaporin-4 water and Kir4.1 potassium channels from glial endfeet, formation of intracellular vacuoles in α-DB-null astrocytes, and defects of the astrocyte-endothelial interactions. These caused deregulation of tight junction proteins in the endothelia. Importantly, α-DB but not dystrophins showed continuous expression throughout development in BBB models. Thus, α-DB emerges as a central organizer of dystrophin-associated protein in glial endfeet and a rare example of a glial protein with a role in maintaining BBB function. Its abnormalities might therefore lead to BBB dysfunction."

The absence of a functional maternal AtLETM2 allele in an Atletm1 mutant background resulted in early seed abortion. Reciprocal crosses revealed that maternally, but not paternally, derived AtLETM2 was absolutely required for seed development.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Flavinylation of Sdh1 was found to occur after import into the matrix and to be influenced by the presence of the iron/sulfur cluster subunit Sdh2 but largely independent of the membrane anchor (10Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Covalent attachment of FAD to the yeast succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein requires import into mitochondria, presequence removal, and folding.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The presence of citric acid intermediates stimulated the flavinylation process (10Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Covalent attachment of FAD to the yeast succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein requires import into mitochondria, presequence removal, and folding.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The covalent addition of FAD was proposed to be autocatalytic (7Lemire B.D. Oyedotun K.S. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1553: 102-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), but recently, a dedicated assembly factor Sdh5 was identified that is required for covalent flavinylation (11Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W. Schiffman J.D. Bentz B.G. Gygi S.P. Winge D.R. Kremer H. Rutter J. SDH5, a gene required for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase, is mutated in paraganglioma.Science. 2009; 325: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). The role of Sdh5 in Sdh1 flavinylation was discovered by the interaction of the two proteins and the demonstration that sdh5Δ yeasts were devoid of SDH activity and lacked flavinylated Sdh1. The direct role of Sdh5 in Sdh1 flavinylation was shown by the enhanced covalent addition of FAD to recombinant Sdh1 expressed in bacteria in the presence of Sdh5. However, the mechanism by which the 22-kDa Sdh5 protein mediates flavinylation of Sdh1 remains unresolved. The human Sdh5 ortholog, SDHAF2, was shown to have a corresponding role in covalent flavinylation in human cells (11Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W. Schiffman J.D. Bentz B.G. Gygi S.P. Winge D.R. Kremer H. Rutter J. SDH5, a gene required for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase, is mutated in paraganglioma.Science. 2009; 325: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Mutations in SDHAF2 are associated with a neuroendrocrine tumor designated as paraganglioma. Mutations in the SDH structural genes are also detected in a range of tumors, including paraganglioma, pheochromocytomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and renal cell carcinoma (12Rutter J. Winge D.R. Schiffman J.D. Succinate dehydrogenase - Assembly, regulation, and role in human disease.Mitochondrion. 2010; 10: 393-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Recently, the bacterial ortholog of Sdh5 was identified in the bacterium Serratia. The factor designated SdhE was shown to interact with the flavoprotein (SdhA) and independently associate with FAD (13McNeil M.B. Clulow J.S. Wilf N.M. Salmond G.P. Fineran P.C. SdhE is a conserved protein required for the flavinylation of succinate dehydrogenase in bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18418-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This is the first suggestion that the assembly factor may mediate Sdh1 flavinylation by presenting bound FAD. Whereas sdh5Δ cells exhibited a specific defect in SDH, the bacterial sdhE mutant showed a more pleiotropic defect, suggesting SdhE may flavinylate other flavoproteins (13McNeil M.B. Clulow J.S. Wilf N.M. Salmond G.P. Fineran P.C. SdhE is a conserved protein required for the flavinylation of succinate dehydrogenase in bacteria.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 18418-18428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). SDH is one of many flavoproteins with a covalently bound cofactor. SDH has an 8α-N3-histidyl-FAD linkage, but other flavoproteins use cysteinyl-FAD or tyrosyl-FAD linkages (14Heuts D.P. Scrutton N.S. McIntire W.S. Fraaije M.W. What's in a covalent bond? On the role and formation of covalently bound flavin cofactors.FEBS J. 2009; 276: 3405-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Two large families of covalent flavoproteins are the glucose oxidase/methanol oxidase family and the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase family. Within the vanillyl-alcohol oxidase family, FAD linkages to histidine, cysteine, and tyrosine are known, although no ancillary enzyme is known to catalyze the covalent addition. Covalent flavinylation with FAD is known to proceed nonenzymatically, albeit slowly. In the present study, we identify essential arginines in the C-terminal tail in yeast Sdh1 that are required for flavinylation and SDH assembly. The impaired assembly of the tetrameric enzyme with these Sdh1 mutants correlates with the lack of FAD binding. All Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study were derivatives of Trp303 (Mata ura3-1 ade2-1 trp1-1 his3-11,15 leu2-3 112). Deletion strains sdh1Δ, sdh2Δ, sdh3Δ, and sdh4Δ, in addition to plasmid pRS414 Sdh2-His6Myc2, were kindly provided by Dr. Jared Rutter at the University of Utah. Additional deletion strains (flxΔ, sdh5Δ, sdh3Δsdh4Δ double) were constructed by homologous recombination using either the KanMX4 or the HIS3MX6 disruption cassettes (15Longtine M.S. McKenzie 3rd, A. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Additional modules for versatile and economical PCR-based gene deletion and modification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4168) Google Scholar). The C-terminal mutants of SDH1 along with SDH1 WT under the control of its own promoter and CYC1 terminator were expressed in sdh1Δ strain or subcloned into integrating pRS405 vectors for chromosomal expression. The integrating constructs were further digested with AflII and integrated at the leu2-3,112 locus of sdh1Δ to be able to express wild type and mutants SDH1 chromosomally. All integrated strains were confirmed by PCR analysis of the locus. The C-terminal point mutations were introduced by QuikChange mutagenesis PCR system (Agilent Technology). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Yeast strains were transformed using lithium acetate. Strains were grown in synthetic complete medium lacking the amino acid(s) to maintain plasmid selection with either 2% galactose or 2% glycerol/lactate as the carbon source. For carbon swap cultures overnight, 50-ml glucose-grown cultures were used to inoculate 1 liter of medium containing 2% galactose as the carbon source. Cells were grown to an A600 nm ∼ 0.4 to 0.5 and harvested in a sterile manner. The cell pellet was resuspended in fresh medium containing 2% glycerol/lactate as the carbon source and grown for ∼10 h (∼3–4 doublings) before harvesting. Intact mitochondria were isolated using previously described methods of Glick and Pon (16Glick B.S. Pon L.A. Isolation of highly purified mitochondria from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 213-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) and Diekert et al. (17Diekert K. De Kroon A.I. Kispal G. Lill R. Isolation and subfractionation of mitochondria from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 37-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For HPLC experiments, isolated mitochondria were further purified using ultracentrifugation through a Histodenz (Sigma Aldrich) step gradient (14 and 22%). Total mitochondrial protein was quantified using either the Bradford (18Bradford M.M. A rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of microgram quantities of protein utilizing the principle of protein-dye binding.Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar) or the bicinchoninic acid assays (19Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Measurement of protein using bicinchoninic acid.Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18634) Google Scholar). Steady-state levels of mitochondrial proteins were analyzed using the NuPAGE Bis-Tris gel system (Invitrogen) using MES as the buffer system. Proteins were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed using the indicated primary antibodies and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Primary antibodies were obtained from the following: anti-Sdh1, Sdh2, Sdh3, and Sdh5 were generated in this study (21st Century Biochemicals). Anti-HA, anti-Myc, and anti-porin were purchased from Rockland, Roche Applied Science, and Molecular Probes, respectively. Anti-F1 ATP synthase was a generous gift from Alex Tzagoloff. Analysis of yeast mitochondrial native membrane complexes was performed using the native PAGE gel system (Invitrogen) that is based on the blue-native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) technique developed by Schägger and von Jagow (20Schägger H. von Jagow G. Blue native electrophoresis for isolation of membrane protein complexes in enzymatically active form.Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1907) Google Scholar). Solubilized mitochondria (1% digitonin for 20–40 μg of mitochondrial protein) were separated on either 3–12% or 4–16% Bis-Tris native gels, transferred to PVDF membrane, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Purified mitochondria (0.75 to 1 mg of total protein) were solubilized using either 0.1% DDM or 1% digitonin in PBS buffer and clarified at 20,000 × g for 5 min. For hemin-agarose pulldown assay, the clarified lysates were incubated with 20 to 40 μl of hemin-agarose beads (Sigma), which had been prereduced using DTT. Binding was performed for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C. Beads were subsequently washed (15 min × 4) with PBS buffer, 0.1% DDM or 1% digitonin, ± DTT, and eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. For immunoprecipitation, the clarified lysates were incubated with anti-HA or anti-Myc beads for 2 h or overnight at 4 °C, washed four times with PBS buffer + 0.1% DDM or 1% digitonin, and eluted with 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. The clarified lysate, final wash, and eluate fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Bands from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel from hemin-agarose pulldown assay were also excised for identification using MS analysis of the tryptic digests. SDH activities in isolated yeast mitochondria were measured spectrophotometrically at 22 °C following the succinate-dependent, phenazine methosulfate-mediated reduction of either 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol or cytochrome c as the terminal electron acceptor described for intact mitochondria (21Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Flavinylation of succinate: ubiquinone oxidoreductase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Levels of covalently attached FAD to Sdh1 were analyzed as described previously (11Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W. Schiffman J.D. Bentz B.G. Gygi S.P. Winge D.R. Kremer H. Rutter J.

Chem. 2004; 279: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the gel was placed in a 10% acetic acid solution for 20 min to oxidize flavin. The FAD band was visualized upon exposure to UV light using a Bio-Rad Gel Doc transilluminator. Freely soluble mitochondrial FAD levels were analyzed as described previously (23Tzagoloff A. Jang J. Glerum D.M. Wu M. FLX1 codes for a carrier protein involved in maintaining a proper balance of flavin nucleotides in yeast mitochondria.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7392-7397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Purified mitochondria (500 μg) were pelleted at 20,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 500 μl of deionized water and boiled at 105 °C for 10–15 min to precipitate proteins. The resulting yellowish supernatant was clarified at 20,000 × g for 5 min and analyzed on a Waters Sunfire C18 HPLC column (5 μm 4.6 × 150 mm) equilibrated with 15% MeOH in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.4. Flavin was eluted using a linear MeOH gradient to 75% in 10 mm ammonium acetate, pH 6.4, for 25 min and monitored at 450 nm. Elution times were compared with FAD and FMN flavin mononucleotide standards (Sigma). The concentration of FAD for the peak area was determined using an extinction coefficient of 11,300 m−1 cm−1 at 450 nm (9Hägerhäll C. Sled V. Hederstedt L. Ohnishi T. The trinuclear iron-sulfur cluster S3 in Bacillus subtilis succinate:menaquinone reductase; effects of a mutation in the putative cluster ligation motif on enzyme activity and EPR properties.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The focus on SDH flavinylation initiated from a goal to isolate heme-binding proteins within the mitochondria using affinity purification with a heme-agarose matrix. Detergent-solubilized mitochondrial lysates were chromatographed on heme-agarose affinity beads either in the oxidized (Fe3+; hemin) or reduced (Fe2+; heme) state (Fig. 1A). Proteins adsorbed on the heme matrix were eluted by SDS treatment and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. With reduced heme-agarose, a single major band was apparent with Coomassie staining that was identified as Sdh1 by mass spectrometry. The 67-kDa band was further verified to be Sdh1 by immunoblotting using Sdh1 antisera. Subunits Sdh2 and Sdh3 were also detected with their respective antiseras but in less abundance compared with Sdh1 (data not shown). The adsorption of Sdh1 on heme-agarose was competed by preincubation of the lysate with free heme, and no Sdh1 was retained on activated agarose beads lacking the heme moiety. The retention of Sdh1 on heme-agarose suggested Sdh1 may possess a heme-binding motif. Inspection of the yeast Sdh1 protein sequence showed a single CP motif in the C-terminal tail found in a subset of heme-binding proteins (Fig. 1B). This C-terminal tail strand lies on the surface of Sdh1 and is located far from the buried FAD cofactor. Deletion of a C-terminal 13-residue segment in Sdh1 generated a truncate (designated ClipK628) that was stably expressed, although cells harboring this truncate failed to propagate on non-fermentable carbon sources (Fig. 1C). The presence of the Sdh1 truncate abrogated assembly of the tetrameric SDH enzyme and steady-state levels of Sdh2 and Sdh3 were markedly attenuated (Fig. 1D). The truncated Sdh1 was not flavinylated as shown by the lack of a FAD fluorescence band after SDS-PAGE (10Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Covalent attachment of FAD to the yeast succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein requires import into mitochondria, presequence removal, and folding.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4055-4060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Chromatography of detergent lysates on the mutant cells on heme-agarose did not result in any retention of the Sdh1 truncate on the column (Fig. 1E). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to map the residues responsible for flavinylation and heme-agarose binding. C630A, V633S, or a double P634A,P635A mutation in Sdh1 had no effect of glycerol/lactate growth (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, the C630A mutant in the CP motif did not attenuate SDH activity or compromise steady-state protein levels (Fig. 2B). Heme-agarose binding was also unaffected (Fig. 2C). However, cells harboring a mutant allele of Sdh1 with a R638A substitution were compromised in glycerol/lactate growth (Fig. 2A) and SDH activity (Fig. 2D). Flavinylation of the mutant Sdh1 was attenuated by ∼60% relative to the WT subunit. Assembly of the mutant Sdh1 into the tetrameric complex was not impaired as seen by BN-PAGE (Fig. 2E). The R638A mutant Sdh1 retained the ability to associate with the heme-agarose matrix (Fig. 2F). A double C630A,R638A mutant revealed a more impaired phenotype than the single R638A mutant. The double mutant in Sdh1 failed to support SDH assembly of the tetrameric complex (Fig. 2E), resulting in a marked drop in steady-state levels of Sdh2 and Sdh3 (Fig. 2D). The mutant Sdh1 exhibited no flavinylation, although the mutant Sdh1 was stably expressed. Furthermore, the double mutant failed to associate with the heme-agarose matrix (Fig. 2F). The diminished flavinylation in the C-terminal Sdh1 mutants raised the possibility that the mutations attenuated the known interaction of Sdh1 and Sdh5 that is important in Sdh1 flavinylation. The cellular level of Sdh5 has been observed to be dependent on Sdh1 (11Hao H.X. Khalimonchuk O. Schraders M. Dephoure N. Bayley J.P. Kunst H. Devilee P. Cremers C.W. Schiffman J.D. Bentz B.G. Gygi S.P. Winge D.R. Kremer H. Rutter J. SDH5, a gene required for flavination of succinate dehydrogenase, is mutated in paraganglioma.Science. 2009; 325: 1139-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) (i.e. Sdh5 is destabilized in cells lacking Sdh1). Steady-state levels of Sdh5 were tested in sdh1Δ cells expressing Sdh1 mutant alleles (Fig. 3A). A significant diminution in Sdh5 levels was apparent in cells with the double C630A,R638A Sdh1 mutant. The interaction of Sdh1 and Sdh5 is apparent by co-immunoprecipitation. Mitochondria from cells containing HA-tagged Sdh5 and wild-type Sdh1 were solubilized with digitonin and incubated with anti-HA beads. The immunoprecipitation of Sdh5 led to the co-purification of Sdh1 in the WT as expected (Fig. 3B). This was also true with Sdh1 containing the single R638A mutation. Attempts to test binding of Sdh5 to the double C630A,R638A Sdh1 mutant were compromised by the attenuated steady-state levels of Sdh5 in the Sdh1 mutant cells. Although the IP of Sdh5-HA failed to show any Sdh1, the reduction in input Sdh5 makes the absence of Sdh1 in the co-immunoprecipitate difficult to interpret. We evaluated whether the impaired SDH function observed in sdh1Δ cells expressing Sdh1 mutant alleles was suppressed by overexpressing SDH5 (Fig. 4A). Expression of SDH5 from a low-copy vector in the Sdh1 mutant cells did not significantly increase total Sdh5 levels as measured by immunoblotting with antisera to Sdh5 (data not shown). However, the expression of SDH5 gave a modest improvement in respiratory growth (Fig. 4A) as well as SDH activity (Fig. 4B) in cells harboring the R638A mutant Sdh1. Sdh1 flavinylation was also partially elevated by overexpression of Sdh5. The respiratory growth enhancement was not further increased by overexpression of SDH5 using a high-copy vector (data not shown). In contrast, no rescue was observed in growth or SDH activity of cells containing the double C630A,R638A Sdh1 mutant. The effect of overexpression of Sdh5 in cells with the Sdh1 double mutant actually led to a diminution in SDH activity rather than any restoration. In the absence of a more marked rescue of the respiratory defect of R638A Sdh1 mutant cells by overexpression of SDH5, we isolated genetic suppressors in the mutant cells to gain possible insight into the mechanism underlying the point mutants. In addition to focusing on the R638A mutant, we analyzed a Sdh1 mutant in a second conserved arginine residue (Arg582) that is spatially adjacent to Arg638. The corresponding residue in human SDHA is Arg589 and a R589W mutation was reported in a patient afflicted with paraganglioma (24Burnichon N. Brière J.J. Libé R. Vescovo L. Rivière J. Tissier F. Jouanno E. Jeunemaitre X. Bénit P. Tzagoloff A. Rustin P. Bertherat J. Favier J. Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. SDHA is a tumor suppressor gene causing paraganglioma.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2010; 19: 3011-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). We generated R582W and R582A mutations in yeast Sdh1 and observed that both substitutions resulted in lack respiratory growth (Fig. 5A). Plating sdh1Δ cells expressing either R638A, R589A, or R589W Sdh1 from high-copy plasmids at high density on glycerol/lactate medium resulted in the appearance of papillae that contained mutants proficient in respiratory growth. The suppressors failed to respire in each case when the plasmid expressing the Sdh1 point mutation was shed, suggesting intragenic suppression. Rescue of the plasmid in Escherichia coli and retransformation in parent sdh1Δ cells resulted in glycerol/lactate growth. DNA sequencing of the R638A mutant SDH1 gene revealed a second-site mutation resulting in a G70V substitution. The respiratory competency of the G70V,R638A Sdh1 mutant is shown in Fig. 5A. Gly70 is located 35 Å from Arg638 but is close to the FAD. It is also on the opposite face from the His90 that forms the covalent bond (Fig. 5B). SDH activity was restored in these second-site mutant cells (Fig. 6A). The cultures used for the studies in Fig. 6 were propagated using a carbon swap protocol in which cultures initially grown in glucose to an A600 nm ∼ 0.5 were switched to glycerol/lactate for the last 10 h of the experiment. Under these conditions, even the sdh1Δ cells maintained viability during the last phase of growth. Propagation of sdh1Δ cells with the R638A Sdh1 mutant on galactose medium rather than the carbon swap protocol resulted in markedly reduced SDH activity as seen in Figs. 2D and 4B; however, the presence of the G70V,R638A Sdh1 suppressor mutant did not exhibit enhanced SDH activity. The abundance of wild-type and mutant SDH complexes is markedly enhanced in glycerol/lactate medium relative to galactose medium (data not shown). The genetic suppressor screen carried out with the R582A Sdh1 mutant cells resulted in the recovery of a second site suppressor with a M599R Sdh1 substitution in addition to the original R582A mutation (Fig. 5A). Met599 is spatially close to Arg582 and Arg638 (Fig. 5, C and D). The double R582A,M599R Sdh1 mutant was catalytically active unlike the R582A single mutant (Fig. 6A). Steady-state levels of Sdh1, Sdh2, and Sdh3 were restored. The suppressor was able to partially assemble, unlike the R582A single mutant, into a tetrameric SDH complex that could be visualized upon extended exposure of the blue-native immunoblot (Fig. 6B). In addition, the doubl"

In principle, one-dimensional diffusion can provide a means for DNA-bound proteinases to locate and process DNA-bound substrates. Here, we show that this is correct. In vitro, AVP-pVIc complexes processed a purified virion precursor protein in a DNA-dependent reaction; in a quasi in vivo environment, heat-disrupted ts-1 virions, AVP-pVIc complexes processed five different precursor proteins in DNA-dependent reactions. Sliding of AVP-pVIc complexes along DNA illustrates a new biochemical mechanism by which a proteinase can locate its substrates, represents a new paradigm for virion maturation, and reveals a new way of exploiting the surface of DNA."
https://openalex.org/W2001379435,"Aggressive variants of meningiomas (WHO grade II and III) represent up to 30% of those tumors that are among the most common primary central nervous system tumors in adults. Currently, there is no effective treatment for grade-II and -III meningiomas, the main treatment remaining surgical excision. Genetic studies have highlighted two main events associated with meningioma progression: an increase of chromosomal instability in tumors with NF2 inactivation and homozygous deletions or point mutations of the CDKN2AB locus. In this study we demonstrated that in mice, in addition to bi-allelic Nf2 inactivation, homozygous and heterozygous Adenovirus Cre-mediated Cdkn2ab deletions lead to increased meningioma frequency (72% and 50%, respectively) with a shorter latency (3.5 and 7.8 months, respectively) compared with control cohorts and induce grade II/III meningioma progression with an incidence of 34% and 28%, respectively. Moreover, Cdkn2ab inactivation in arachnoidal cells was associated with decreased senescence compared with Nf2−/− and wild-type arachnoidal cells in vitro. We have established three mouse meningioma cell lines and generated a syngenic orthotopic meningioma mouse model with 50–100% grade-II/III meningiomas after reimplantation. Comparative genomic hybridization of four meningiomas from Cdkn2ab homozygous mice and three cell cultures revealed the absence of unbalanced chromosomal segments in tumors and several chromosome imbalances in cell cultures. In addition, we were able to detect meningiomas by using bioluminescence and to evaluate tumor vascular permeability by dynamic magnetic resonance imaging. These results show that Nf2 and Cdkn2ab cooperate to promote meningioma progression in mice. The short latency of tumor development and the ability to derive grade II/III meningioma cell cultures are key aspects of this model to promote its use in pre-clinical drug testing."

Hdm2 amplification was found in 13% of the same sample, which was found independently of LOH for hDMP1. Conversely, LOH for hDMP1 was found in mutually exclusive fashion with that of INK4a/ARF and p53, and was associated with low Ki67 index and diploid karyotype. Consistently, LOH for hDMP1 was associated with luminal A category and longer relapse-free survival, while that of p53 was associated with non-luminal A and shorter survival. Thus, loss of hDMP1 could define a new disease category associated with prognosis of breast cancer patients. Human breast epithelial cells/cancer cells with wild-type p53 were sensitive to growth inhibition by activated Dmp1:ER while those that delete p14(ARF) or p53, and/or Hdm2 amplification showed partial or nearly complete resistance, indicating that p53 is a critical target for hDMP1 to exhibit its biological activity."
https://openalex.org/W2018720655,"The microtubule-associated protein targeting protein for Xenopus kinesin-like protein 2 (TPX2) plays a key role in spindle assembly and is required for mitosis in human cells. In interphase, TPX2 is actively imported into the nucleus to prevent its premature activity in microtubule organization. To date, no function has been assigned to nuclear TPX2. We now report that TPX2 plays a role in the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks induced by ionizing radiation. Loss of TPX2 leads to inordinately strong and transient accumulation of ionizing radiation-dependent Ser-139-phosphorylated Histone 2AX (γ-H2AX) at G(0) and G(1) phases of the cell cycle. This is accompanied by the formation of increased numbers of high intensity γ-H2AX ionizing radiation-induced foci. Conversely, cells overexpressing TPX2 have reduced levels of γ-H2AX after ionizing radiation. Consistent with a role for TPX2 in the DNA damage response, we found that the protein accumulates at DNA double strand breaks and associates with the mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1) and the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, both key regulators of γ-H2AX amplification. Pharmacologic inhibition or depletion of ATM or MDC1, but not of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), antagonizes the γ-H2AX phenotype caused by TPX2 depletion. Importantly, the regulation of γ-H2AX signals by TPX2 is not associated with apoptosis or the mitotic functions of TPX2. In sum, our study identifies a novel and the first nuclear function for TPX2 in the cellular responses to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2101695385,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal tumor and possesses a unique propensity to exhibit either a spontaneous regression or an unrestrained growth. However, the underlying mechanism for this paradoxical clinical outcome remains largely unclear. Quantitative RT–PCR analysis on 102 primary NB tumors revealed that lower Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) expression is frequently found in the unfavorable NB (Mann–Whitney test, P=0.027). In particular with the high-risk factors such as age of patient >1 year, MYCN amplification and low TRKA expression, the decreased expression of KLF4 was significantly associated with an unfavorable NB outcome. Despite knockdown of KLF4 alone is not sufficient to increase tumorigenicity of NB cells in vivo, stable expression of KLF4 short hairpin RNA in Be(2)-C cells significantly promoted growth of NB cells and inhibited cell differentiation toward fibromuscular lineage. In concordant with these observations, overexpression of KLF4 in SH-SY-5Y cells profoundly suppressed cell proliferation by direct upregulation of cell-cycle inhibitor protein p21WAF1/CIP1, and knocking down p21WAF1/CIP1 could partially rescue the suppressive effect of KLF4. Importantly, KLF4 overexpressing cells have lost their neuroblastic phenotypes, they were epithelial-like, strongly substrate-adherent, expressing smooth muscle marker and became non-tumorigenic, suggesting that KLF4 expression is crucial for lineage determination of NB cells, probably, favoring spontaneous tumor regression. Subsequent global gene expression profiling further revealed that transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) and cell-cycle pathways are highly dysregulated upon KLF4 overexpression, and myogenic modulators, MEF2A and MYOD1 were found significantly upregulated. Taken together, we have demonstrated that KLF4 contributes to the favorable disease outcome by directly mediating the growth and lineage determination of NB cells."
https://openalex.org/W2028287827,"Apc-driven tumor formation in patients and Apc-mutant mouse models is generally attributed to increased levels of β-catenin signaling. We and others have proposed that a specific level of β-catenin signaling is required to successfully initiate tumor formation, and that each tissue prefers different dosages of signaling. This is illustrated by APC genotype−tumor phenotype correlations in cancer patients, and by the different tumor phenotypes displayed by different Apc-mutant mouse models. Apc1638N mice, associated with intermediate β-catenin signaling, characteristically develop intestinal tumors (<10) and extra-intestinal tumors, including cysts and desmoids. Apc1572T mice associated with lower levels of β-catenin signaling are free of intestinal tumors, but instead develop mammary tumors. Although the concept of β-catenin signaling dosage and its impact on tumor growth among tissues is gaining acceptance, it has not been formally proven. Additionally, alternative explanations for Apc-driven tumor formation have been proposed. To obtain direct evidence for the dominant role of β-catenin dosage in tumor formation and tissue-specific tumor predisposition, we crossed Apc1638N mice with heterozygous β-catenin knockout mice, thereby reducing β-catenin levels. Whereas all the Apc1638N;Ctnnb1+/+ mice developed gastrointestinal tumors, none were present in the Apc1638N;Ctnnb1−/+ mice. Incidence of other Apc1638N-associated lesions, including desmoids and cysts, was strongly reduced as well. Interestingly, Apc1638N;Ctnnb1−/+ females showed an increased incidence of mammary tumors, which are normally rarely observed in Apc1638N mice, and the histological composition of the tumors resembled that of Apc1572T-related tumors. Hereby, we provide in vivo genetic evidence confirming the dominant role of β-catenin dosage in tumor formation and in dictating tumor predisposition among tissues in Apc-driven cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2053068153,"Cerebellar granule neurons are the most abundant neurons in the brain, and a critical element of the circuitry that controls motor coordination and learning. In addition, granule neuron precursors (GNPs) are thought to represent cells of origin for medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Thus, understanding the signals that control the growth and differentiation of these cells has important implications for neurobiology and neurooncology. Our previous studies have shown that proliferation of GNPs is regulated by Sonic hedgehog (Shh), and that aberrant activation of the Shh pathway can lead to medulloblastoma. Moreover, we have demonstrated that Shh-dependent proliferation of GNPs and medulloblastoma cells can be blocked by basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). But while the mitogenic effects of Shh signaling have been confirmed in vivo, the inhibitory effects of bFGF have primarily been studied in culture. Here, we demonstrate that mice lacking FGF signaling in GNPs exhibit no discernable changes in GNP proliferation or differentiation. In contrast, activation of FGF signaling has a potent effect on tumor growth: treatment of medulloblastoma cells with bFGF prevents them from forming tumors following transplantation, and inoculation of tumor-bearing mice with bFGF markedly inhibits tumor growth in vivo. These results suggest that activators of FGF signaling may be useful for targeting medulloblastoma and other Shh-dependent tumors."

Store-operated Ca(2+) entry and its major determinants are known to be important for cell migration, but the mechanism of their involvement in this complex process is unknown. This study presents a detailed characterization of distinct roles of Orai1, STIM1, and PLA2g6 in focal adhesion (FA) formation and migration. Using HEK293 cells, we discovered that although molecular knockdown of Orai1, STIM1, or PLA2g6 resulted in a similar reduction in migration velocity, there were profound differences in their effects on number, localization, and lifetime of FAs. Knockdown of STIM1 caused an increase in lifetime and number of FAs, their redistribution toward lamellae region, and an increase in cell tail length. In contrast, the number of FAs in Orai1- or PLA2g6-deficient cells was significantly reduced, and FAs accumulated closer to the leading edge. Assembly rate and Vinculin phosphorylation of FAs was similarly reduced in Orai1, PLA2g6, or STIM1-deficient cells. Although Orai1 and PLA2g6 accumulated and co-localized at the leading edge, STIM1 distribution was more complex. We found STIM1 protrusions in lamellipodia, which co-localized with FAs, whereas major accumulation could be seen in central and retracting parts of the cell. Interestingly, knockdown of Orai1 and PLA2g6 produced similar and non-additive effect on migration, whereas knockdown of STIM1 simultaneously with either Orai1 or PLA2g6 produced additional inhibition. Together these data suggest that although Orai1, PLA2g6, and STIM1 play major roles in formation of new FAs at the leading edge, STIM1 may also be involved in Orai1- and PLA2g6-independent disassembly of FAs in the back of cells."
https://openalex.org/W2122163756,"Late in an adenovirus infection, the viral proteinase (AVP) becomes activated to process virion precursor proteins used in virus assembly. AVP is activated by two cofactors, the viral DNA and pVIc, an 11-amino acid peptide originating from the C terminus of the precursor protein pVI. There is a conundrum in the activation of AVP in that AVP and pVI are sequence-independent DNA-binding proteins with nm equilibrium dissociation constants such that in the virus particle, they are predicted to be essentially irreversibly bound to the viral DNA. Here, we resolve that conundrum by showing that activation of AVP takes place on the one-dimensional contour of DNA. In vitro, pVI, a substrate, slides on DNA via one-dimensional diffusion, D(1) = 1.45 × 10(6) bp(2)/s, until it binds to AVP also on the same DNA molecule. AVP, partially activated by being bound to DNA, excises pVIc, which binds to the AVP molecule that cut it out. pVIc then forms a disulfide bond with AVP forming the fully active AVP-pVIc complex bound to DNA. In vivo, in heat-disrupted immature virus, AVP was also activated by pVI in DNA-dependent reactions. This activation mechanism illustrates a new paradigm for virion maturation and a new way, by sliding on DNA, for bimolecular complexes to form among proteins not involved in DNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2006773539,"The biological relationships among self-renewal, tumorigenicity and lineage differentiation of human osteosarcoma-initiating cells (OSIC) remain elusive, making it difficult to identify and distinguish OSIC from osteosarcoma-forming cells (OSFC) for developing OSIC-targeted therapies. Using a new inverse-lineage tracking strategy coupled with serial human-to-mouse xenotransplantation, we identified a subpopulation of osteosarcoma cells with OSIC-like properties and sought to distinguish them from their progeny, OSFC. We found that serial transplantation of cells from different osteosarcoma cell lines and primary osteosarcoma tissues progressively increased the CD49f(+) subpopulation composing the bulk of the osteosarcoma mass. These CD49f(+) cells displayed characteristics of OSFC: limited in vivo tumorigenicity, weak lineage differentiation, more differentiated osteogenic feature and greater chemo-sensitivity. By contrast, their parental CD49f(-)CD133(+) cells had an inhibited osteogenic fate, together with OSIC-like properties of self-renewal, strong tumorigenicity and differentiation to CD49f(+) progeny. Hence, the CD49f(-)CD133(+) phenotype appears to identify OSIC-like cells that possess strong tumorigenicity correlated with an impaired osteogenic fate and the ability to initiate tumor growth through the generation of CD49f(+) progeny. These findings advance our understanding of OSIC-like properties and, for the first time, provide a much-needed distinction between OSIC and OSFC in this cancer."

Aβ is generated by sequential cleavage of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) by β- and γ-secretase, respectively.

Aβ is a normally secreted peptide derived from the larger β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the concerted and sequential action of two proteases, β- and γ-secretases. Although normally secreted as a soluble peptide, Aβ aggregates and accumulates in the brain to form classic amyloid deposits that form the core of neuritic plaques as well as other assemblies including a variety of soluble oligomers (3Glabe C.C.

APP is cleaved by β-secretase at the N terminus of Aβ to generate a large secreted derivative (sAPPβ) and a membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment (CTFβ). Subsequent cleavage of CTFβ by γ-secretase results in the production of Aβ. Alternatively, APP can be cleaved within the Aβ sequence by α-secretase, which generates a secreted derivative (sAPPα) and its corresponding C-terminal fragment (CTFα). As β-secretase cleavage is essential for Aβ production and α-secretase precludes Aβ formation, β- and α-secretase cleavage pathways are often referred to as amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic, respectively. γ-Secretase is an intramembrane-cleaving protease complex that cleaves its substrates within their transmembrane domains (10Selkoe D.

Therefore, assembled γ-secretase complexes present in the ER require transport to the late compartments of the secretory pathway, to process substrates.

Human RER1 is an integral membrane protein that is 196 amino acids long and has four putative transmembrane domains that are predicted to form an M-shaped topology with both N and C termini facing the cytosol.

Both studies showed that RER1 could affect γ-secretase assembly by regulating retention or retrieval of γ-secretase subunits. In the present study, the role of RER1 in modulation of γ-secretase activity and APP trafficking was investigated. We show that RER1 is associated with the γ-secretase complex and regulates the intracellular localization and trafficking of γ-secretase. Furthermore, we find that increasing RER1 expression decreases APP maturation, suggesting a potential mechanism by which RER1 may influence the trafficking of APP. Our data extend the previous reports of the effects of RER1 on γ-secretase but reveal a dual role for RER1 in regulating trafficking through secretory pathways of APP and γ-secretase to regulate the intramembrane proteolysis.

Malfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) leads to cystic fibrosis, but the regulation of CFTR is not fully understood. Here, we identified the intermediate filament protein keratin K18 (K18) as a CFTR-binding protein by various approaches. We mapped a highly conserved ""hydrophobic patch"" ((1413)FLVI(1416)) in the CFTR C-terminus, known to determine plasmalemmal CFTR stability, as the K18-binding site. On the other hand, the C-terminal tail of K18 was found to be a critical determinant for binding CFTR. Overexpression of K18 in cells robustly increased the surface expression of wild-type CFTR, whereas depletion of K18 through RNA interference specifically diminished it. K18 binding increased the surface expression of CFTR by accelerating its apical recycling rate without altering CFTR biosynthesis, maturation, or internalization. Importantly, CFTR surface expression was markedly reduced in duodenal and gallbladder epithelia of K18(-/-) mice. Taken together, our results suggest that K18 increases the cell surface expression of CFTR by interacting with the CFTR C-terminal hydrophobic patch. These findings offer novel insights into the regulation of CFTR and suggest that K18 and its dimerization partner, K8, may be modifier genes in cystic fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2071396933,"Despite initial dramatic response, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant lung cancer patients always acquire resistance to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Gatekeeper T790M mutation in EGFR is the most prevalent genetic alteration underlying acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI, and EGFR mutant lung cancer cells are reported to be addictive to EGFR/Akt signaling even after acquired T790M mutation. Here, we focused on Akt kinase-interacting protein1 (Aki1), a scaffold protein of PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase)/Akt that determines receptor signal selectivity for non-mutated EGFR, and assessed its role in EGFR mutant lung cancer with or without gatekeeper T790M mutation. Cell line-based assays showed that Aki1 constitutively associates with mutant EGFR in lung cancer cells with (H1975) or without (PC-9 and HCC827) T790M gatekeeper mutation. Silencing of Aki1 induced apoptosis of EGFR mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with Aki1 siRNA dramatically inhibited growth of H1975 cells in a xenograft model. Moreover, silencing of Aki1 further potentiated growth inhibitory effect of new generation EGFR-TKIs against H1975 cells in vitro. Aki1 was frequently expressed in tumor cells of EGFR mutant lung cancer patients (53/56 cases), including those with acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment (7/7 cases). Our data suggest that Aki1 may be a critical mediator of survival signaling from mutant EGFR to Akt, and may therefore be an ideal target for EGFR mutant lung cancer patients, especially those with acquired EGFR-TKI resistance due to EGFR T790M gatekeeper mutation."

In the present study we have employed both cell-based degradation and reconstituted ubiquitination approaches to define molecular features associated with IRS1 critical for CRL7-mediated ubiquitination and degradation. We have mapped IRS1 degradation signal sequence to its N-terminal 574 amino acid residues, of which the integrity of Ser-307/Ser-312 and Ser-527, each constituting a S6K1 phosphorylation consensus site, was indispensible for supporting CRL7-forced degradation. In vitro, S6K1 was able to support the ubiquitination of bacterially expressed IRS1 N-terminal fragment by CRL7 but at low levels. In contrast, CRL7 supported efficient ubiquitination of IRS1 N-terminal fragment in hyperphosphorylated form, which was isolated from infected insect cells, suggesting requirement of additional phosphorylation by kinases yet to be identified. Finally, removal of IRS1 amino acids 1–260 led to substantial reduction of ubiquitination efficiency, suggesting a role for this region in mediating productive interactions with CRL7.

Depending on the nutritional state of the organism, growth factors, such as insulin, signal to mTORC1 by initiating binding to their receptors. Insulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1, receptors are tyrosine kinases, which, upon ligand binding, phosphorylate the insulin receptor substrate (IRS), such as IRS1 at multiple tyrosine residues. The resulting IRS1 phosphotyrosines provide docking sites capable of recruiting a set of key Src homology 2-containing signaling proteins that include PI3K and Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), thus activating the downstream Akt (via PI3K) and RAS (through Grb2) pathways. In the Akt cascade, it is thought that the activated Akt inhibits the TSC1/2 (tuberous sclerosis 1/2) complex, thereby liberating the small G-protein Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), which in turn activates mTORC1 and its downstream effector kinase S6 kinase 1 (S6K1), leading to elevated ribosome biogenesis and cell growth (reviewed in Refs. 3Fisher T.L.

Restraining PI3K. mTOR signaling goes back to the membrane.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 35-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). This inhibitory loop is triggered by hyperactivated mTORC1/S6K1 that catalyze multisite IRS1 seryl phosphorylation, which suppresses the ability of IRS1 to interact with the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 receptors and promotes its ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation (6Zhande R. Mitchell J.J. Wu J. Sun X.J. Molecular mechanism of insulin-induced degradation of insulin receptor substrate 1.Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 1016-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The mTORC1/S6K-IRS1 feedback loop appears to directly impact the pathogenesis of diabetes and cancer. It was shown that overfeeding causes hyperactivation of mTORC1 that triggers the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 feedback loop, thereby leading to insulin desensitization (7Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Absence of S6K1 protects against age- and diet-induced obesity while enhancing insulin sensitivity.Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of IRS1 activity suppresses Akt, causing reduction of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis in liver and muscle, as well as the increase of gluconeogenesis and glucose release by the liver. Thus, the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 feedback worsens hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia, which are clinical conditions resulting from excess nutrients. In further support of the role of the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 feedback loop in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, S6K1-deficient mice displayed enhanced insulin sensitivity when chronically maintained on a high fat diet (7Um S.H. Frigerio F. Watanabe M. Picard F. Joaquin M. Sticker M. Fumagalli S. Allegrini P.R. Kozma S.C. Auwerx J. Thomas G. Absence of S6K1 protects against age- and diet-induced obesity while enhancing insulin sensitivity.Nature. 2004; 431: 200-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (1358) Google Scholar). Previous mouse studies have elucidated a role for the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 negative feedback loop in cancer suppression (8Manning B.D. Logsdon M.N. Lipovsky A.I. Abbott D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Feedback inhibition of Akt signaling limits the growth of tumors lacking Tsc2.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). It was shown that TSC2+/− mice develop relatively benign hemangiomas because of sporadic loss of the functional Tsc2 allele. The lack of malignant tumor development is resulted from inactive Akt, because TSC2 down-regulation leads to hyperactivation of mTORC1/S6K1, which inactivates IRS1 and hence PI3K. Indeed, circumventing the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 feedback loop by reduction of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) activity results in enhanced Akt activation, as well as more frequent and aggressive hemangiomas (8Manning B.D. Logsdon M.N. Lipovsky A.I. Abbott D. Kwiatkowski D.J. Cantley L.C. Feedback inhibition of Akt signaling limits the growth of tumors lacking Tsc2.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1773-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 negative feedback loop plays a critical role in restraining PI3K activity, thereby halting the progression to malignancy. In addition, the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 feedback loop appears to limit the efficacy of rapamycin, a potent inhibitor of mTORC1, as an anti-cancer drug in clinical trials. Rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 and hence the mTROC1/Sk61-IRS1 feedback loop, resulting in severe up-regulation of PI3K. Thus, by shutting down the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 feedback loop, the rapamycin-based therapeutic approaches may elevate PI3K activity, which provides important pro-survival and proliferative signals through Akt (9O'Reilly K.E.

The IRS1 down-regulation requires PI3K and mTORC1, because it is sensitive to treatment by wortmannin, a PI3K inhibitor, and by rapamycin, the mTORC1 inhibitor. Subsequent studies have since confirmed these results and have further determined that the turnover of IRS1 requires the 26 S proteasome and ubiquitination activity, respectively (6Zhande R.

Furthermore, the integrity of Ser-312, a target of mTORC1, was shown to mediate, at least in part, the degradation of human IRS1 (11Greene M.W. Sakaue H. Wang L. Alessi D.R. Roth R.A.

Our recent work has suggested a role for Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase 7 (CRL7) in targeting IRS1 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation (12Xu X. Sarikas A. Dias-Santagata D.C. Dolios G. Lafontant P.J. Tsai S.C. Zhu W. Nakajima H. Nakajima H.O. Field L.J. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. The CUL7 E3 ubiquitin ligase targets insulin receptor substrate 1 for ubiquitin-dependent degradation.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). CRL7 is a member of the CRLs (Cullin-RING finger E3 ligases), which comprise the largest E3 family responsible for directing the polyubiquitination of substrate proteins, thereby leading to their eventual degradation by the 26 S proteasome (13Sarikas A. Hartmann T. Pan Z.Q. The cullin protein family.Genome Biology. 2011; 12: 220Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). CRL7 contains cullin 7 (CUL7) as a molecular scaffold, the F-box protein Fbw8 as a substrate receptor, Skp1, and the ROC1 (Rbx1) RING finger protein. In the CRL7 complex, CUL7 assembles both an Skp1·Fbw8 heterodimeric substrate-targeting module and a ROC1 RING-based ubiquitin core ligase. It is thought that the organization of the CRL7 subunits places Fbw8 within the proximity of ROC1, which recruits an E2-conjugating enzyme. Consequently, a substrate, once bound to Fbw8, is positioned optimally for accepting an ubiquitin moiety in an E2-catalyzed transfer reaction. Cormier-Daire and co-workers (14Huber C.

In addition, both the cul7 (16Arai T. Kasper J.S. Skaar J.R. Ali S.H. Takahashi C. DeCaprio J.A. Targeted disruption of p185/Cul7 gene results in abnormal vascular morphogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad.

Taken together, the genetic evidence has strongly suggested a pivotal role for CRL7 in growth control. It has been shown that Fbw8 binds to IRS1 and promotes its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation and that inactivation/deletion of Fbw8 and CUL7, respectively, accumulated IRS1 (12Xu X. Sarikas A. Dias-Santagata D.C. Dolios G. Lafontant P.J. Tsai S.C. Zhu W. Nakajima H. Nakajima H.O. Field L.J. Wang R. Pan Z.Q.

Moreover, Fbw8-induced degradation of IRS1 was dependent upon mTORC1 activity. In addition, embryonic fibroblasts of cul7−/− mice were found to accumulate IRS1 and exhibit increased activation of IRS1 downstream pathways Akt and MEK/ERK. These results have led to a proposal that CRL7 participates in the mTORC1/S6K1-IRS1 negative feedback control by targeting IRS1 for degradation. In the present study, we sought to understand the IRS1 molecular determinants that dictate its destruction by CRL7. We constructed plasmids allowing expression in mammalian cells of human IRS1 regions starting with varying N-terminal sites and ending at amino acid position 574 using the previously generated pcDNA3.1-V5-IRS1–1-574 (12Xu X.

The primers used for PCR amplification of various IRS1 sequences are: 114–574, forward primer, CACCCACAACCGTGCTAAG, and reverse primer, GCGGGTGGGCACGAACTAGGAGTGCCTGTGTCC; 261–574, forward primer, CACCAGTGATGAGTTCCGC, and reverse primer, GCGGGTGGGCACGAACTAGGAGTGCCTGTGTCC; and 300–574, forward primer, CACCACCCGCCGATCACG, and reverse primer, GCGGGTGGGCACGAACTAGGAGTGCCTGTGTCC. Various truncations were first cloned into pENTR entry vector (Invitrogen), followed by TOPO cloning into the destination vector pcDNA3.1/nV5-DEST (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate human IRS1 1–574 point mutants, site-direct mutagenesis was performed with pcDNA3.1-V5-IRS1–1-574 as template, using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and sets of primers as follows: V5-IRS1–1-574S307A/S312A, TCACGCACTGAGGCCATCACCGCCACCGCCCCGGCCAGCATG-5′, and CATGCTGGCCGGGGCGGTGGCGGTGATGGCCTCAGTGCGTGA-3′; and V5-IRS1–1-574S527A, CGAAAGAGAACTCACGCGGCAGGCACATCCCCT-5′ and AGGGGATGTGCCTGCCGCGTGAGTTCTCTTTCG-3′. V5-IRS-1S307A/S312AS527A was generated by performing mutagenesis reaction with V5-IRS-1S307A/S312A as template, using the set of primers for the construction of V5-IRS-1S527A. To create pGEX-4T3-GST-IRS1 1–574, IRS1 1–574 sequence was inserted into the multicloning sites on the pGEX-4T3 vector. To construct bacmid DNA expressing GST-IRS1 1–574 or GST-IRS1–261-574, the respective DNA fragment encoding either of these proteins was amplified by PCR using pcDNA3.1-V5-IRS1–1-574 or pcDNA3.1-V5-IRS1 261–574 as template. The PCR primer sequences, designed to include the BamHI restriction site followed by the Kozak sequence (ACC) at 5′ end and the EcoRI restriction site at the 3′ end, were: ACCATCGGGCGCGGATCCACCATGTCCCCTATACTAGGT-5′ and CCGGAATTCCTAGGAGTGCCTGTGTCCC-3′. The resulting PCR product was then cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI predigested pFast-Bac1 vector (Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system; Invitrogen), creating pFast-GST-IRS1–1-574 or pFast-GST-IRS1–261-574. The recombinant pFast-GST-IRS1–1-574 or pFast-GST-IRS1–261-574 was transformed into competent DH10Bac cells where transposition takes place. The bacmid DNA containing GST-IRS1–1-574 or GST-IRS1–261-574 was isolated following the manufacturer's instructions. All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. To prepare baculovirus expressing GST-IRS1–1-574 or GST-IRS1–261-574, Sf9 cells (9 × 105 cells in one well of a 6-well plate) were transfected with recombinant bacmid DNA pFast-GST-IRS1–1-574 or pFast-GST-IRS1–261-574 (2 μg each) using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). A high titer viral stock was generated after three rounds of amplification as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were grown on 2 ml/plate DMEM, 10% FBS, and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic (Invitrogen). DNA(s) was transfected up to 1 μg/plate using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). To harvest cells at 48 h post-transfection, the plates are washed with 1 ml of PBS, and the cells were pelleted at 180 × g for 5 min using a Beckman CS-6KR centrifuge at 4 °C. The cell pellets were resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 12.5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 400 μm phenylarsine oxide, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) in 0.2 ml/plate, and the resulting suspension was sonicated (seven repetitive 20-s treatments). The mixture was agitated for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation (at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min). The cleared extracts were used for immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analyses. Generation of stable cell lines expressing FLAG-CUL7 and Myc-Fbw8 (293C7F8) was carried out using a previously published protocol (18Dias D.C. Dolios G. Wang R. Pan Z.Q. CUL7.

HEK293 cells, plated at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm plate and maintained in 10 ml of the growth medium (DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 unit/ml of penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), were co-transfected with a plasmid expressing the Geneticin selection marker, pcDNA3.1-FLAG-CUL7 and pCR3.1-Myc-Fbw8, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were diluted at various ratios (1:5, 1:50, and 1:500) and plated onto 15-mm plates followed by the addition of the selection medium (25 ml/plate) containing the growth medium plus Geneticin (700 μg/ml; Invitrogen). The selection medium was changed daily for the first 3–5 days after the Geneticin treatment to remove dead cells and then every third day for the next 2 weeks. Well isolated colonies were picked 10–15 days using sterile cloning discs (Scienceware) presoaked in trypsin-EDTA (Invitrogen). Each disc was then placed into an individual well, containing the selection medium, within a 24-well chamber. 24 h later, the discs were removed, and the individual clones were allowed to proliferate in the selection medium. Protein expression was determined by immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis using extracts prepared from one 60-mm plate worth of cells. To prepare bacterially expressed GST-IRS1–1-574 (B-GST-IRS1–1-574), pGEX-GST-IRS1–1-574 was transformed into the pJY2 (Affiniti)-expressing-BL21 (DE3) cells and grown in Luria Broth (500 ml) with 0.4% glucose in the presence of ampicillin and chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4, the cultures were induced with 0.8 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h. The cells were pelleted at 5,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C followed by suspension in 125 culture volume with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, 0.4 μg/ml antipain, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mm DTT). The suspension was then sonicated (four repetitive 20-s treatments) and centrifuged at 17,000 rpm in an SS-34 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. Soluble extracts (20 ml) were mixed with glutathione-S-Sepharose beads (3 ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then packed into a column and washed consecutively with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 mm PMSF) plus 0.5 m NaCl (30 ml) and buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl (15 ml). Bound protein was eluted with 15 ml of 20 mm reduced glutathione contained in buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl. Following dialysis with buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl, GST-IRS1–1-574 was then concentrated using centrifugal filters (Amicon-Millipore). The yield was 3.5 mg (7 mg/ml). To prepare insect cell-expressed GST-IRS1 1–574 (BI-GST-IRS1 1–574) or GST-IRS1 261–574 (BI-GST-IRS1 261–574), Hive Five cells (3.25 × 107) were infected (multiplicity of infection of 5) with each baculovirus. At 48 h post-infection, the cells were harvested, washed once with cold PBS, and resuspended in 2 ml/flask of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 12.5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 400 μm phenylarsine oxide, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The resuspension was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30min at 4 °C. Soluble extracts were mixed with glutathione-S-Sepharose beads (0.2 ml for 1.6 ml of supernatant from eight flasks). Purification was carried out as described above. The yields were 170 and 296 μg (1.7 and 2.96 mg/ml), respectively. CRL7 was isolated from extracts derived from forty-four 150-mm plate worth of 293C7F8 cells (16CF) and maintained in buffer RSB (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The mixture was then sonicated (three repetitive 20-s treatment), followed by the addition of buffer LSB (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The mixture was then rotated for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by ultracentrifugation at 37,000 rpm for 30min at 4 °C. 10 ml of resulting supernatant (∼5 mg of protein/ml) were adsorbed to M2-agarose beads (0.5 ml; Sigma) by rotating the mixture at 4 °C for 14–16 h. The resulting beads were packed into a column, which was washed with 100 ml of wash buffer (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. Bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (1 mg/ml) in Buffer A plus 0.1 m NaCl, for three consecutive times, 1.5 ml/time. The pooled elutes were concentrated to ∼0.2 ml using centrifugal filters (Millipore). For in vitro phosphorylation described in Fig. 3B, B-GST-IRS1–1-574 (7.7 pmol) was incubated with S6K1T389E/PDK (0.3 μg) at 37 °C for 45min in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 2 mm NaF, and 10 nm okadaic acid. For in vitro dephosphorylation described in Figs. 4A and 5A, BI-GST-IRS1–1-574 (10 pmol) or BI-GST-IRS1–261-574 (20 pmol) was incubated with λ phosphatase (New England BioLabs) at concentration of 0.1, 1, or 10 ng in a reaction mixture (20 μl) containing λ phosphatase buffer (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 30 min.FIGURE 4Hyperphosphorylation of IRS1 1–574 activates ubiquitination.

CRL7 (0.13 pmol; shown in Fig. 3A) was added along with PK-Ub (33 μm), E1 (9 nm), and UbcH5c (10 μm), and the final reaction volume was adjusted to 30 μl. Incubation continued at 37 °C for 60 min. To enrich the reaction products, the identical reaction mixture in triplets were combined and absorbed to glutathione-S-Sepharose beads (12 μl).

https://openalex.org/W2085678794,"Preventing tumor neovascularisation is one of the strategies recently developed to limit the dissemination of cancer cells and apparition of metastases. Although these approaches could improve the existing treatments, a number of unexpected negative effects have been reported, mainly linked to the hypoxic condition and the subsequent induction of the pro-oncogenic hypoxia inducible factor(s) resulting from cancer cells’ oxygen starvation. Here, we checked in vivo on colon cancer cells an alternative approach. It is based on treatment with myo-inositol trispyrophosphate (ITPP), a molecule that leads to increased oxygenation of tumors. We provide evidence that ITPP increases the survival of mice in a model of carcinomatosis of human colon cancer cells implanted into the peritoneal cavity. ITPP also reduced the growth of subcutaneous colon cancer cells xenografted in nu/nu mice. In the subcutaneous tumors, ITPP stimulated the expression of the homeobox gene Cdx2 that is crucial for intestinal differentiation and that also has an anti-tumoral function. On this basis, human colon cancer cells were cultured in vitro in hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia was shown to decrease the level of Cdx2 protein, mRNA and the activity of the Cdx2 promoter. This decline was unrelated to the activation of HIF1α and HIF2α by hypoxia. However, it resulted from the activation of a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases-like mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, as assessed by the fact that LY294002 and U0126 restored high Cdx2 expression in hypoxia. Corroborating these results, U0126 recapitulated the increase of Cdx2 triggered by ITPP in subcutaneous colon tumor xenografts. The present study provides evidence that a chemical compound that increases oxygen pressure can antagonize the hypoxic setting and reduce the growth of human colon tumors implanted in nu/nu mice."
https://openalex.org/W2069779612,"Schwannomas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that often occur in the setting of an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome, including neurofibromatosis types 1 (NF1) and 2 (NF2), familial schwannomatosis and Carney complex. Loss of the NF2 tumor suppressor (encoding NF2, or Merlin) is associated with upregulation of the Rac1 small GTPase, which is thought to have a key role in mediating tumor formation. In prior studies, we generated a mouse model of schwannomas by performing tissue-specific knockout (KO) of the Carney complex gene Prkar1a, which encodes the type 1A regulatory subunit of protein kinase A. These tumors exhibited down-regulation of Nf2 protein and an increase in activated Rac1. To assess the requirement for Rac1 in schwannoma formation, we generated a double KO (DKO) of Prkar1a and Rac1 in Schwann cells and monitored tumor formation. Loss of Rac1 reduced tumor formation by reducing proliferation and enhancing apoptosis. Surprisingly, the reduction of tumor formation was accompanied by re-expression of the Nf2 protein. Furthermore, activated Rac1 was able to downregulate Nf2 in vitro in a Pak-dependent manner. These in vivo data indicate that activation of Rac1 is responsible for suppression of Nf2 protein production; deficiency of Nf2 in Schwann cells leads to loss of cellular growth control and tumor formation. Further, PKA activation through mutation in Prkar1a is sufficient to initiate Rac1 signaling, with subsequent reduction of Nf2 and schwannomagenesis. Although in vitro evidence has shown that loss of Nf2 activates Rac1, our data indicate that signaling between Nf2 and Rac1 occurs in a bidirectional fashion, and these interactions are modulated by PKA."

Our results identify a novel mechanism of Shp2 inhibition that may promote cardiac hypertrophy. We demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2, is a component of the A-kinase-anchoring protein (AKAP)-Lbc complex. AKAP-Lbc facilitates PKA phosphorylation of Shp2, which inhibits its protein-tyrosine phosphatase activity. Given the important cardiac roles of both AKAP-Lbc and Shp2, we investigated the AKAP-Lbc-Shp2 interaction in the heart. AKAP-Lbc-tethered PKA is implicated in cardiac hypertrophic signaling; however, mechanism of PKA action is unknown. Mutations resulting in loss of Shp2 catalytic activity are also associated with cardiac hypertrophy and congenital heart defects. Our data indicate that AKAP-Lbc integrates PKA and Shp2 signaling in the heart and that AKAP-Lbc-associated Shp2 activity is reduced in hypertrophic hearts in response to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation and PKA activation. Thus, while induction of cardiac hypertrophy is a multifaceted process, inhibition of Shp2 activity through AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA is a previously unrecognized mechanism that may promote compensatory cardiac hypertrophy.

For example, to ensure that signaling is tightly regulated, AKAPs coordinate both signal activators (e.g. protein kinases) and signal terminators (e.g. protein phosphatases) (7Schillace R.V.

Localized regulation and integration of signal transduction are important for proper cardiac function, and perturbation of this leads to heart failure. We are now just beginning to understand the spatiotemporal aspects of AKAP-mediated signaling in the heart. Multiple cardiac AKAPs have been characterized and shown to perform a critical role in mediating the effects of neurohumoral stimulation on the heart by integrating PKA activity with additional enzymes (10Mauban J.R.

A recent proteomic study suggests that differential expression of AKAPs coupled with alterations in the AKAP “interactome” may be critical factors in heart failure (13Aye T.T. Soni S. van Veen T.A. van der Heyden M.A. Cappadona S. Varro A. de Weger R.A. de Jonge N. Vos M.A. Heck A.J. Scholten A. Reorganized PKA-AKAP associations in the failing human heart.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2012; 52: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have demonstrated previously that AKAP-Lbc expression is up-regulated under hypertrophic conditions in rats as well as in human heart failure samples, promoting cardiac hypertrophy through a protein kinase D1 (PKD1)-mediated mechanism (14Carnegie G.K. Soughayer J. Smith F.D. Pedroja B.S. Zhang F. Diviani D. Bristow M.R. Kunkel M.T. Newton A.C. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. AKAP-Lbc mobilizes a cardiac hypertrophy signaling pathway.Mol.

Cardiac hypertrophy is initially a beneficial, compensatory process, decreasing wall stress and increasing cardiac output and stroke volume. However, prolonged hypertrophy is maladaptive, transitioning to decompensation and cardiac failure. Multiple pathological hypertrophic pathways converge on a set of transcriptional regulators, promoting initiation of a developmental gene-reprogramming paradigm (often termed the fetal gene response). These “fetal” cardiac genes encode proteins involved in contraction, calcium handling, and metabolism, and their activation accompanies cardiac hypertrophy (15Frey N. Olson E.N. Cardiac hypertrophy: the good, the bad, and the ugly.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2003; 65: 45-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar, 16Heineke J. Molkentin J.D. Regulation of cardiac hypertrophy by intracellular signalling pathways.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 7: 589-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). In addition to binding PKD1, AKAP-Lbc acts as Rho-guanine nucleotide exchange factor, implicated in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (17Appert-Collin A. Cotecchia S. Nenniger-Tosato M. Pedrazzini T. Diviani D. The A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)-Lbc-signaling complex mediates α1-adrenergic receptor-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

AKAP-Lbc also anchors protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKCα and PKCη isoforms) (19Carnegie G.K. Smith F.D. McConnachie G. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D.

LEOPARD syndrome patients most commonly manifest hypertrophic cardiomyopathy due to mutations in the PTPN11 gene encoding Shp2 that generally results in impaired Shp2 catalytic activity (23Kontaridis M.I.

Here, we observe similar results, showing diminished Shp2 activity associated with AKAP-Lbc in hypertrophic heart samples induced by chronic isoproterenol treatment to activate PKA. Mechanistically, our data suggest that AKAP-Lbc facilitates the phosphorylation of Shp2 by PKA, acting to inhibit Shp2 PTP activity, which may in turn promote cardiac hypertrophy. Anti-V5-agarose, anti-FLAG-agarose and anti-FLAG antibody were from Sigma. Anti-V5 antibody (mouse, 1:5000) and purified recombinant PKD1 were from Invitrogen. Anti-Shp2 antibody (rabbit, 1:1000) was from Santa Cruz and was also kindly provided by Geng Sheng Feng (University of California San Diego) (rabbit, 1:20,000). Anti-phospho-PKA substrate (RRXS*/T*) antibody (1:1000) was from Cell Signaling Technology. Purified recombinant PKA was from Promega. cDNA for Shp2 expression was kindly provided by Geng-Sheng Feng. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) plasmids were originally from Chang-Deng Hu (Purdue University). Full-length AKAP-Lbc was expressed as a RFP and V5-tagged protein in pcDNA3.1, or as FLAG-AKAP-Lbc in pEGFP-N1. pEGFP-N1-AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA expresses a mutant version of AKAP-Lbc that cannot bind the PKA-RII regulatory subunit (25Diviani D.

For phosphorylation experiments, the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin-LR was included (100 nm). Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Cleared lysates were incubated with antibodies for 1 h at 4 °C with rocking, followed by precipitation of antibody-antigen complexes with protein A/G-agarose. Immunoprecipitates were washed 5 × 1 ml in lysis buffer, eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE. GST pulldowns were performed similarly, except that protein complexes were isolated by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. For endogenous protein co-immunoprecipitations (co-IPs) from heart, frozen mouse hearts were homogenized by Polytron in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5%, and protease inhibitors. The heart extract was clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 20 min and then used for IP. Proteomics and informatics services were provided by the CBC-UIC Research Resources Center Mass spectrometry, Metabolomics and Proteomics Facility, established in part by a grant from The Searle Funds at the Chicago Community Trust to the Chicago Biomedical Consortium. BiFC expression constructs consisting of the N terminus or C terminus of Venus (VN and VC, respectively) were originally provided by Chang-Deng Hu. AKAP-Lbc was cloned into the VN vector with the Venus fragment fused to the N terminus. Shp2 was cloned into the VC vector with the Venus fragment at the C terminus. Cells were transiently transfected and then imaged ∼20 h after transfection so that the proteins were not highly overexpressed. CFP was expressed along with the BiFC constructs, as a marker for transfected cells. Confocal images were acquired using a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 mounted on an Axiovert 100 M microscope. Images were obtained using a 514-nm argon laser for YFP and 458 nm for CFP with a Plan-Apochromat 63×/1.4 oil immersion objective lens. A 531–595-nm wavelength bandpass filter was used for YFP emission, and a 470–500-nm wavelength bandpass filter was used for CFP, with a pinhole of 0.7 Airy units, which provides a z resolution of ∼0.6 μm. Following immunoprecipitation of either AKAP-Lbc or Shp2, immune complexes were washed five times with IP buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.95, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100) before being resuspended in phosphatase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 0.01% Brij-35, pH 7.5). The phosphatase assay was carried out in a total reaction volume of 50 μl using 30 μm fluorescein diphosphate as substrate. After a 20-min incubation at 30 °C, supernatant was transferred to a 96-well plate, and phosphatase activity was measured using a PHERAstar FS microplate reader, with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 520 nm. For calibration of PTP activity using this assay, T cell PTP (New England Biolabs) was serially diluted and used for assay as described above. Fluorescence intensity was measured for known amounts of enzyme ranging from 0 to 500 milliunits of specific activity. One unit is defined as the amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 nmol of p-nitrophenyl phosphate (50 mm) in 1 min at 30 °C in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. Immunoprecipitated Shp2 was phosphorylated in vitro in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.03% Brij-35, 10 mm MgAc2, 100 mm ATP, 1 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP) supplemented with bacterially purified recombinant PKA C-subunit (0.2 mg), or recombinant PKD1 (0.2 mg), for 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated by washing twice with fresh kinase buffer prior to resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer or PTP activity assay. 16-week-old, male FVB mice received continuous subcutaneous administration of isoproterenol (25 μg/g per day for 30 days) or saline control via minipump (Alzet) implantation. Hearts were assessed before and after treatment by M-mode echocardiography using a VisualSonics Vevo 770 ultrasound instrument. Hearts were removed from mice, and a small section of the left ventricle was fixed in paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Differences in quantitative variables were examined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or an unpaired two-tailed t test. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant (*), a p value < 0.01 was considered very significant (**), and a p value < 0.001 was considered extremely significant (***). All analyses were performed using InStat. The AKAP-Lbc signaling complex is composed of multiple protein kinases (18Cariolato L. Cavin S. Diviani D. A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP)-Lbc anchors a PKN-based signaling complex involved in α1-adrenergic receptor-induced p38 activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 7925-7937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 26Smith F.D. Langeberg L.K. Cellurale C. Pawson T. Morrison D.K. Davis R.J. Scott J.D. AKAP-Lbc enhances cyclic AMP control of the ERK1/2 cascade.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 1242-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); therefore, we wondered whether AKAP-Lbc may also bind protein phosphatases. To identify novel binding partners, we performed multiple proteomic screens using GST-tagged AKAP-Lbc fragments to purify associated proteins, which were identified by tandem MS. This approach identified the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 as an AKAP-Lbc associated protein (Fig. 1A). The AKAP-Lbc-Shp2 interaction was validated in HEK293 cells by co-precipitation of endogenous Shp2 with AKAP-Lbc (Fig. 1B). In addition, endogenous Shp2 was co-purified with endogenous AKAP-Lbc from heart extract and vice versa (Fig. 1, C and D). Next, we performed mapping studies to define the Shp2 site of interaction with AKAP-Lbc. Binding of Shp2 to a family of immobilized GST-AKAP-Lbc fragments detected an interaction with a central portion of AKAP-Lbc (residues 1388–1922; Fig. 1E). To visualize the interaction of AKAP-Lbc and Shp2 inside cells, we used BiFC. This technique has several advantages over more traditional immunostaining or fluorescent protein localization. In particular, the BiFC method enables us to specifically visualize the Shp2-AKAP-Lbc interaction at potentially low levels of protein expression, without background (i.e. fluorescence is observed only for Shp2-AKAP-Lbc complex formation) (27Kerppola T.K.

Protoc. 2008; 3: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A nonfluorescent fragment (VN) from a split Venus fluorescent protein was fused to AKAP-Lbc (VN-AKAP-Lbc), and a nonfluorescent VC fragment was fused to Shp2 fragment (VC-Shp2). Interaction of AKAP-Lbc and Shp2 brings the two nonfluorescent fragments into close proximity, thereby reconstituting a functional fluorescent protein, resulting in fluorescence. Results in Fig. 2 show that Shp2 specifically interacts with AKAP-Lbc in the cytoplasm of HEK293 cells (Fig. 2B). In Fig. 2C (merged image), yellow indicates overlap of AKAP-Lbc-Shp2 complex BiFC signal (green) with α-actinin (red), suggesting that a portion of the AKAP-Lbc-Shp2 complex has a sarcomeric and sarcolemmal localization in cardiac myocytes. We did not observe significant differences in AKAP-Lbc-Shp2 complex formation and localization by BiFC in myocytes under basal and agonist treatment. No fluorescence was observed when VN-AKAP-Lbc was expressed alone or with a noninteracting control VC-protein (VC-PI3K). Similarly, no fluorescence was observed with expression of VC-Shp2 alone or with a control VN-protein (VN-Rab5). Western blot analysis of protein expression confirmed that all proteins were similarly expressed and were not degraded. Collectively, our biochemical studies and imaging data demonstrate that Shp2 is a component of the AKAP-Lbc signaling complex. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous AKAP-Lbc from mouse heart extract followed by in vitro PTP activity assay demonstrates that tyrosine phosphatase activity co-purifies with AKAP-Lbc (Fig. 3A). Shp2 IPs were used as a positive control in these experiments, and sodium orthovanadate was used to inhibit tyrosine phosphatase activity, demonstrating that we are specifically measuring PTP activity. Additionally, our results show that PTP activity is associated with V5-tagged AKAP-Lbc, expressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3B). Using two different antibodies in these experiments (anti-AKAP-Lbc and anti-V5) gives us confidence that the phosphatase activity measured is specifically associated with AKAP-Lbc. Importantly, we also carried out measurements of AKAP-Lbc-associated PTP activity from samples where Shp2 had been previously immunodepleted. Results presented in Fig. 3B show a dramatic reduction of PTP activity associated with AKAP-Lbc, suggesting that we are measuring Shp2 activity in the AKAP-Lbc complex. Western blots indicating corresponding levels of AKAP-Lbc and Shp2 from samples used in these assays are shown in Fig. 3C. Our results demonstrate that Shp2 is a component of the AKAP-Lbc complex; however, the function and regulation of Shp2 in the AKAP-Lbc complex are unclear. To determine whether Shp2 is a substrate for either PKA and/or PKD1, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays using [γ-32P]MgATP with immunopurified Shp2 and purified recombinant PKA and PKD1 (Fig. 4A). Following SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, autoradiography results demonstrate that Shp2 is phosphorylated by PKA but not by PKD1. PKD1 autophosphorylation as well as a positive control using HDAC5 (a well characterized PKD1 substrate) indicates that the PKD1 was active in this assay (Fig. 4A, top panel). Western blotting for Shp2 confirmed that equivalent levels of Shp2 were present in both the PKA and PKD1 reaction (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). To determine whether PKA phosphorylates Shp2 in vivo, we expressed FLAG-Shp2 in HEK293 cells and then treated these cells with forskolin and IBMX to activate PKA, prior to lysis. Following immunoprecipitation of Shp2, SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose, we performed Western blotting using an anti-PKA-phosphosubstrate antibody. This antibody recognizes PKA substrate phosphorylation with the consensus sequence R-R-X-pS/pT. Results in Fig. 4B show that Shp2 phosphorylation is barely detected under basal conditions, whereas Shp2 is phosphorylated in response to PKA activation. Similarly, Shp2 is phosphorylated by PKA in cardiac myocytes in response to isoproterenol stimulation (Fig. 4C). Overall, these results indicate that Shp2 is a PKA substrate. Next, we determined whether PKA activation and subsequent Shp2 phosphorylation modulate Shp2 activity. HEK293 cells were untreated or treated with forskolin/IBMX for 20 min prior to lysis, AKAP-Lbc immunoprecipitation, and PTP assay. Activation of PKA reduces AKAP-Lbc-associated PTP activity, suggesting that PKA inhibits Shp2 activity in the AKAP-Lbc complex (Fig. 5A). The levels of AKAP-Lbc and associated Shp2 in these assays were determined by Western blotting, indicating similar levels of AKAP-Lbc and co-immunoprecipitating Shp2 in all conditions (Fig. 5B). Together, these results indicate that PKA does not affect the association of Shp2 with AKAP-Lbc, but acts to inhibit Shp2 catalytic activity in the AKAP-Lbc complex. For direct evidence that PKA phosphorylation of Shp2 inhibits Shp2 catalytic activity we phosphorylated Shp2 in vitro with purified PKA and then performed a PTP activity assay. Results indicate that Shp2 is phosphorylated (Fig. 5D) and displays reduced PTP activity compared with untreated Shp2 (Fig. 5C). Next, we tested whether AKAP-Lbc facilitates PKA phosphorylation of Shp2 by anchoring PKA. We used a mutant form of AKAP-Lbc that cannot bind PKA, termed AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA. The AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA mutant has two amino acid substitutions (A1251P/I1260P) in the PKA-RII binding region that disrupt the amphipathic helix structure required for hydrophobic binding to the regulatory subunit of PKA, thereby disrupting PKA association (29Diviani D. Scott J.D. AKAP signaling complexes at the cytoskeleton.J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1431-1437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HEK293 cells expressing wild-type AKAP-Lbc or the AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA mutant were untreated or treated with forskolin/IBMX for 20 min prior to lysis, AKAP-Lbc immunoprecipitation, and PTP assay. Activation of PKA significantly reduces wild-type AKAP-Lbc (WT-AKAP-Lbc)-associated PTP activity, but not PTP activity associated with the AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA mutant (Fig. 5E). Western blot analysis demonstrates equal expression of both WT-AKAP-Lbc and AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA and equal co-immunoprecipitation of Shp2 (Fig. 5F). Using the PKA-phosphosubstrate antibody we examined the extent of Shp2 phosphorylation in Shp2 associated with either WT-AKAP-Lbc or the AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA mutant. Results show that PKA phosphorylation of Shp2 associated with AKAP-Lbc is barely detectable under basal conditions. In response to forskolin/IBMX treatment, Shp2 phosphorylation is significantly diminished when Shp2 is co-expressed with the AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA mutant compared with the WT-AKAP-Lbc complex (Fig. 5, F and G). By carrying out an additional experiment, where we precleared AKAP-Lbc (and associated Shp2) from cell lysate prior to Shp2 immunoprecipitation, our results demonstrate that the Shp2 not associated with AKAP-Lbc is minimally phosphorylated by PKA, in contrast to the Shp2 that is associated with AKAP-Lbc (Fig. 5H). Collectively, these data suggest that AKAP-Lbc plays an important role in the regulation of Shp2 activity by facilitating phosphorylation of Shp2 by PKA. In summary, phosphorylation of Shp2 by AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA inhibits Shp2 activity and does not affect the association of Shp2 with AKAP-Lbc. Both AKAP-Lbc and Shp2 are implicated in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. We have previously demonstrated that AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA plays a role in the induction of hypertrophy (14Carnegie G.K. Soughayer J. Smith F.D. Pedroja B.S. Zhang F. Diviani D. Bristow M.R.

Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of Shp2 activity in the AKAP-Lbc complex by PKA may be a previously unrecognized factor in the induction of cardiac hypertrophy. To test this hypothesis, we induced cardiac hypertrophy in mice by chronic infusion of isoproterenol (25 μg/g per day for 30 days) using a minipump (33Taglieri D.M. Monasky M.M. Knezevic I. Sheehan K.A. Lei M. Wang X. Chernoff J. Wolska B.M. Ke Y. Solaro R.J.

Heart morphology and function were assessed immediately by echocardiography prior to minipump implantation and after 30 days. Additionally, a small section of the left ventricle was sectioned and stained with hematoxylin. Results indicate that isoproterenol treatment significantly induced cardiac hypertrophy compared with control animals (infused with saline). Using these samples we observed that PTP activity associated with AKAP-Lbc is significantly decreased in hypertrophic heart compared with control heart (Fig. 6A and Table 1).

No change in Shp2 expression levels under hypertrophic conditions was observed. As in previous experiments, the levels of Shp2 co-immunoprecipitating with AKAP-Lbc were consistent in hypertrophic and control conditions, and importantly, Shp2 is phosphorylated by PKA under isoproterenol-induced hypertrophic conditions (Fig. 6B). Overall, these results suggest that chronic activation of PKA in the heart promotes the inhibition of Shp2 activity associated with AKAP-Lbc. This is a previously unrecognized mechanism that may contribute to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy (depicted in Fig. 7).TABLE 1Echocardiographic data of mice receiving saline solution or isoproterenol (ISO) for 30 daysEchocardiographic parametersBefore saline (n = 3)Control (saline) (n = 3)Before ISO (n = 3)Hypertrophic (ISO) (n = 3)HR, bpm525 ± 12512 ± 15530 ± 10595 ± 22ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.LV FS, %31.71 ± 2.8738.24 ± 4.7735.46 ± 4.3957.42 ± 3.38ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.EF, %59.76 ± 4.0267.82 ± 5.9363.93 ± 5.5687.56 ± 2.33ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.LV ESV, μl61.81 ± 3.6777.86 ± 5.0855.19 ± 5.467.25 ± 1.48ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.LV EDV, μl24.79 ± 2.8725.10 ± 2.9224.73 ± 3.3157.45 ± 5.2ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.LV mass, mg117.50 ± 11.95125.26 ± 4.41117.50 ± 11.95177.30 ± 8.52ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.LVAWd, mm0.87 ± 0.090.87 ± 0.060.97 ± 0.041.24 ± 0.08ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.LVPWd, mm0.82 ± 0.050.80 ± 40.050.77 ± 0.041.11 ± 0.12ap < 0.05 vs. all other groups.a p < 0.05 vs. all other groups. Open table in a new tab FIGURE 7Model showing the role of AKAP-Lbc in the regulation of Shp2 activity by PKA. AKAP-Lbc assembles a signaling complex composed of PKA and Shp2 in cardiac myocytes. Stress conditions (e.g. chronic activation of the β-adrenergic receptor) lead to PKA activation, thereby promoting inhibition of Shp2 activity, which may contribute to the induction of cardiac hypertrophy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this report we identify the tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 as a previously unappreciated component of the AKAP-Lbc signaling complex. Our mapping experiments show that Shp2 binds predominantly to a central region of AKAP-Lbc encompassing amino acid residues 1388–1923. We show that Shp2 is a PKA substrate and that PKA phosphorylation of Shp2 inhibits its PTP activity. Furthermore, by using a mutant form of AKAP-Lbc that is unable to bind PKA, we demonstrate that AKAP-Lbc-anchored PKA modulates Shp2 phosphorylation and activity in the AKAP-Lbc complex. Because AKAP-Lbc also scaffolds and promotes the activation of PKD1, we examined whether PKD1 could phosphorylate Shp2. Our results demonstrate that although PKA and PKD1 are basophilic protein kinases with similar substrate specificity that can phosphorylate shared cardiac substrates, PKD1 does not phosphorylate Shp2. These results indicate that inhibition of Shp2 is specific to PKA signaling and does not occur downstream of PKD. We are currently mapping the site(s) of PKA phosphorylation in Shp2. By performing in vitro PKA phosphorylation reactions using fragments of Shp2, our current data indicate multiple sites of phosphorylation. Using point mutations we are investigating effects on phosphatase activity to pinpoint critical amino acid residues. Given the important cardiac roles of both AKAP-Lbc and Shp2, we performed experiments to investigate the AKAP-Lbc-Shp2 interaction in the heart. Several lines of evidence suggest that AKAP-Lbc interacts with Shp2 in the heart, which may be important for regulation of cardiac function. First, we demonstrate the co-IP of endogenous Shp2 with endogenous AKAP-Lbc from heart extract. Second, we are able to visualize this interaction using a BiFC approach, indicating a cytoplasmic Shp2-AKAP-Lbc interaction, with possible localization at the plasma membrane and association with the cytoskeleton. Third, our in vitro PTP activity assay data indicate that Shp2-PTP activity is associated with endogenous AKAP-Lbc in the heart. Mutations resulting in loss of Shp2 catalytic activity are associated with congenital heart defects and cardiac hypertrophy (23Kontaridis M.I. Swanson K.D. David F.S. Barford D. Neel B.G.

AKAP-Lbc is also implicated in cardiac hypertrophic signaling, and through knockdown/rescue experiments we previously showed that AKAP-Lbc-tethered PKA is important for the induction of cardiac myocyte hypertrophy (14Carnegie G.K. Soughayer J. Smith F.D. Pedroja B.S. Zhang F. Diviani D. Bristow M.R. Kunkel M.T. Newton A.C. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. AKAP-Lbc mobilizes a cardiac hypertrophy signaling pathway.Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar); however, the mechanism of PKA action is unknown. To induce PKA activation and cardiac hypertrophy in vivo, mice were subjected to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation through isoproterenol infusion. Under these hypertrophic conditions, our results indicate that AKAP-Lbc-associated Shp2 activity is reduced. Thus, while induction of hypertrophy is a multifaceted process, inhibition of Shp2 activity through enhanced PKA signaling in response to chronic β-adrenergic stimulation may be a previously unrecognized mechanism promoting compensatory cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, our Shp2 activity data using a form of AKAP-Lbc that is unable to bind PKA (AKAP-Lbc-ΔPKA) supports a model where AKAP-Lbc facilitates the phosphorylation and inhibition of Shp2 through PKA (Fig. 5). Interestingly, we and others have previously observed up-regulation of AKAP-Lbc expression under hypertrophic conditions (14Carnegie G.K. Soughayer J. Smith F.D. Pedroja B.S. Zhang F. Diviani D.

Striated muscle- and cardiac-specific Shp2-null mice show cardiac defects due to decreased ERK1/2 activation and increased Rho, Akt, and mTOR activation (30Kontaridis M.I. Yang W. Bence K.K.

Experiments presented here were performed using a model of compensated hypertrophy, and from our echocardiography data it is clear that the hearts are not in the decompensatory phase leading to heart failure. Therefore it will be of interest to determine Shp2 activity at different stages progressing to heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W2052524650,"ATP binding causes the mispair-bound Msh2-Msh6 mismatch recognition complex to slide along the DNA away from the mismatch, and ATP is required for the mispair-dependent interaction between Msh2-Msh6 and Mlh1-Pms1. It has been inferred from these observations that ATP induces conformational changes in Msh2-Msh6; however, the nature of these conformational changes and their requirement in mismatch repair are poorly understood. Here we show that ATP induces a conformational change within the C-terminal region of Msh6 that protects the trypsin cleavage site after Msh6 residue Arg(1124). An engineered disulfide bond within this region prevented the ATP-driven conformational change and resulted in an Msh2-Msh6 complex that bound mispaired bases but could not form sliding clamps or bind Mlh1-Pms1. The engineered disulfide bond also reduced mismatch repair efficiency in vivo, indicating that this ATP-driven conformational change plays a role in mismatch repair."
https://openalex.org/W2058781037,"It is widely accepted that movement of kinesin motor proteins is accomplished by coupling ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release to conformational changes in the microtubule-binding and force-generating elements of their motor domain. Therefore, understanding how the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins Cik1 and Vik1 are able to function as direct participants in movement of Kar3Cik1 and Kar3Vik1 kinesin complexes presents an interesting challenge given that their motor homology domain (MHD) cannot bind ATP. Our crystal structures of the Vik1 ortholog from Candida glabrata may provide insight into this mechanism by showing that its neck and neck mimic-like element can adopt several different conformations reminiscent of those observed in catalytic kinesins. We found that when the neck is α-helical and interacting with the MHD core, the C terminus of CgVik1 docks onto the central β-sheet similarly to the ATP-bound form of Ncd. Alternatively, when neck-core interactions are broken, the C terminus is disordered. Mutations designed to impair neck rotation, or some of the neck-MHD interactions, decreased microtubule gliding velocity and steady state ATPase rate of CgKar3Vik1 complexes significantly.

Also shown was that Kar3 and Vik1 interact laterally over two adjacent protofilaments when Kar3 is ADP-bound but that the complex transitions to a single-head bound state involving only Kar3 when ADP is exchanged for AMPPNP. Uptake of AMPPNP also caused a minus-end-directed rotation of the stalk-neck element, which resembles the power stroke of Ncd (20Wendt T.G. Volkmann N. Skiniotis G. Goldie K.N. Müller J. Mandelkow E.

Orthologs of Cik1 and Vik1 can be found in numerous fungal relatives of S. cerevisiae (22Gladfelter A. Berman J. Dancing genomes. Fungal nuclear positioning.Nat. Rev.

By studying the structure and function of these proteins, we hypothesized that it may be possible to identify functionally conserved elements that underlie a general mechanism for communication with Kar3. This study focuses on Kar3 and Vik1 proteins from the human fungal pathogen, Candida glabrata. Its genome encodes a single 692-amino acid Kar3 homolog (CAGL0D04994g) that shares 53% sequence identity with ScKar3, and a 584-amino acid Vik1 ortholog (CAGL0H00638g) that shares 23% identity with ScVik1. We have determined the x-ray structures of the motor domain regions of both CgKar3 and CgVik1, the latter of which crystallized in three unique conformations that were not previously observed in this protein. Two of the conformations exhibit rotation of the neck element in a manner similar to Ncd motors in different nucleotide states, suggesting that they may represent discrete intermediates during Kar3Vik1's motile cycle. To determine the importance of neck rotation in CgVik1, we mutated the residue that appears to facilitate neck rotation, as well as one of the neck residues involved in a specific network of interactions with the MHD core. Analysis of these mutants in complex with wild-type CgKar3 showed markedly reduced rates of microtubule gliding and ATP hydrolysis. In these structures, we also observed docking of the C terminus of CgVik1 onto the central β-sheet and its interaction with residues at the neck-core junction in a conformation similar to the C terminus of the ATP-bound form of Ncd (7Heuston E. Bronner C.E. Kull F.J. Endow S.A. A kinesin motor in a force-producing conformation.BMC Struct.

Interestingly, as seen in a separate CgVik1 structure, this docking of the C terminus seems to be completely abolished when the neck loses its α-helical structure and is stabilized in a state where it is undocked from the MHD. Based on this new information, we propose that the neck of Vik1 must change positions during the motile cycle of Kar3Vik1, and interactions between the neck and C terminus of Vik1 may provide the critical link for coupling release of Vik1 and Cik1 from microtubules to microtubule binding and subsequent neck rotation in Kar3 during nucleotide exchange. Plasmids encoding truncated C. glabrata Kar3 and Vik1 proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Figs.

Open table in a new tab Motility assays were performed using WT and mutant CgKar3Vik1 complexes at ∼0.3 μm. Rhodamine-labeled bovine tubulin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was mixed with unlabeled tubulin purified from bovine brain at a molar ratio of 1:4, and the mixture was polymerized, centrifuged, and resuspended in BRB80 (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8 (KOH), 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA). Polarity-marked microtubules were made with rhodamine-labeled microtubules and HiLyteTM 488 microtubules (Cytoskeleton Inc.) by adapting a protocol as described previously by Walter et al. (32Walter W.J. Koonce M.P. Brenner B. Steffen W. Two independent switches regulate cytoplasmic dynein's processivity and directionality.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Microtubules were shredded to generate short filaments before imaging. Anti-histidine antibodies (Fisher) were used to attach the kinesins to the glass surface, which was then blocked with 1 mg/ml BSA. Imaging was performed on spinning disc confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica) in the presence of an oxygen-scavenging system (OSM; BRB80, 1.5 mm MgAc, 1 mg/ml BSA, 200 μg/ml glucose oxidase, 175 μg/ml catalase, 25 mm glucose, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol), 20 μm taxol, 1 mm AMPPNP, and 1 mm ATP as described previously (25Sproul L.R.

To ensure sufficient ATP was present during the imaging process, ATP was regenerated by supplementing the OSM with 0.3 μg/ml phosphocreatine kinase and 2 mm phosphocreatine (25Sproul L.R.

Quorum WaveFX software (Quorum Technologies Inc.) was used to process the images captured and compile them into movies. Microtubule movement was tracked using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics Inc.). ATPase kinetics of the WT and mutant CgKar3Vik1 motors were determined using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase-coupled NADH oxidation reaction (33Huang T.G. Hackney D.D.

Purified CgKar3-N+MD or CgKar3Vik1 (6 μm final concentration) was incubated with microtubules in ATPase buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 25 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT, 40 μm Taxol, pH 7.2) with either 1 mm MgAMPPNP or MgADP, and bound and unbound motors were separated by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm in a TLA100 ultracentrifuge and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (34Duan D. Hnatchuk D.J. Brenner J. Davis D. Allingham J.S.

The structures of two different constructs comprising different portions of the neck region (N) and the entire MHD of CgVik1 were determined by x-ray crystallography (Fig. 1A). The structure of the first construct, CgVik1-sN+MHD was solved to 2.42 Å by molecular replacement using the ScVik1MHD crystal structure (PDB code 2O0A) as the search model (17Allingham J.S. Sproul L.R. Rayment I. Gilbert S.P. Vik1 modulates microtubule-Kar3 interactions through a motor domain that lacks an active site.Cell. 2007; 128: 1161-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The solution showed two molecules in the asymmetric unit whose intermolecular interactions are insufficient to indicate complex formation. Similar to ScVik1MHD, the CgVik1MHD structural motif is an α/β fold that lacks a nucleotide binding pocket (Fig. 1B). Unlike ScVik1MHD, the neck in molecule A of CgVik1-sN+MHD is completely disordered N-terminally from Arg325 (supplemental Fig. S2C), and in molecule B it is extended away (undocked) from the MHD core without defined secondary structure (supplemental Fig. S2D). The extended neck conformation is stabilized by symmetry contacts with the β5a/b strands of another molecule in the crystal lattice. Crystals for the CgVik1-N+MHD construct, which possesses 11 additional residues of the neck (Fig. 1A), also showed two molecules in its asymmetric unit after refinement of its structure to 2.99 Å. In contrast to the CgVik1-sN+MHD molecules, the neck of both molecules of this construct is almost entirely helical, and each differs in their alignment along the MHD core by a ∼37° rotation about a conserved glycine residue (Fig. 1, B and C). The neck of molecule A is oriented downward and away from the small β-lobe (β1a, β1b, and β1c) at the edge of the MHD in a manner that is surprisingly similar to several previous Ncd structures (PDB codes 1CZ7, 2NCD, and 1N6M) (supplemental Fig. S3A) (7Heuston E.

https://openalex.org/W2061797759,"The adenovirus proteinase (AVP), the first member of a new class of cysteine proteinases, is essential for the production of infectious virus, and here we report its structure at 0.98 Å resolution. AVP, initially synthesized as an inactive enzyme, requires two cofactors for maximal activity: pVIc, an 11-amino acid peptide, and the viral DNA. Comparison of the structure of AVP with that of an active form, the AVP-pVIc complex, reveals why AVP is inactive. Both forms have an α + β fold; the major structural differences between them lie in the β-sheet domain. In AVP-pVIc, the general base His-54 Nδ1 is 3.9 Å away from the Cys-122 Sγ, thereby rendering it nucleophilic. In AVP, however, His-54 Nδ1 is 7.0 Å away from Cys-122 Sγ, too far away to be able to abstract the proton from Cys-122. In AVP-pVIc, Tyr-84 forms a cation-π interaction with His-54 that should raise the pK(a) of His-54 and freeze the imidazole ring in the place optimal for forming an ion pair with Cys-122. In AVP, however, Tyr-84 is more than 11 Å away from its position in AVP-pVIc. Based on the structural differences between AVP and AVP-pVIc, we present a model that postulates that activation of AVP by pVIc occurs via a 62-amino acid-long activation pathway in which the binding of pVIc initiates contiguous conformational changes, analogous to falling dominos. There is a common pathway that branches into a pathway that leads to the repositioning of His-54 and another pathway that leads to the repositioning of Tyr-84."
https://openalex.org/W2128766516,"The precursor to adenovirus protein VI, pVI, is a multifunctional protein with different roles early and late in virus infection. Here, we focus on two roles late in infection, binding of pVI to DNA and to the major capsid protein hexon. pVI bound to DNA as a monomer independent of DNA sequence with an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant, K(d)((app)), of 46 nm. Bound to double-stranded DNA, one molecule of pVI occluded 8 bp. Upon the binding of pVI to DNA, three sodium ions were displaced from the DNA. A ΔG(0)(0) of -4.54 kcal/mol for the nonelectrostatic free energy of binding indicated that a substantial component of the binding free energy resulted from nonspecific interactions between pVI and DNA. The proteolytically processed, mature form of pVI, protein VI, also bound to DNA; its K(d)((app)) was much higher, 307 nm. The binding assays were performed in 1 mm MgCl(2) because in the absence of magnesium, the binding to pVI or protein VI to DNA was too tight to determine a K(d)((app)). Three molecules of pVI bound to one molecule of the hexon trimer with an equilibrium dissociation constant K(d)((app)) of 1.1 nm."

Your doctor tells you that you have Parkinson's disease and gives you levodopa, a 60-year-old treatment that temporarily relieves your symptoms. But over time, the medication makes you impulsive, and after a few years, your symptoms return. The doctor tells you that you have developed resistance to your medicine and that nothing else is likely to work—your condition continues to degenerate. Sadly, this is the reality for millions of Americans suffering from Parkinson's disease."
