https://openalex.org/W2047853156,"Motile and morphogenetic cellular processes are driven by site-directed assembly of actin filaments. Formins, proteins characterized by formin homology domains FH1 and FH2, are initiators of actin assembly. How formins simply bind to filament barbed ends in rapid equilibrium or find free energy to become a processive motor of filament assembly remains enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that the FH1-FH2 domain accelerates hydrolysis of ATP coupled to profilin-actin polymerization and uses the derived free energy for processive polymerization, increasing 15-fold the rate constant for profilin-actin association to barbed ends. Profilin is required for and takes part in the processive function. Single filaments grow at least 10 μm long from formin bound beads without detaching. Transitory formin-associated processes are generated by poisoning of the processive cycle by barbed-end capping proteins. We successfully reconstitute formin-induced motility in vitro, demonstrating that this mechanism accounts for the puzzlingly rapid formin-induced actin processes observed in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2049881004,"New genetic data has enabled scientists to re-examine the relationship between human genetic variation and 'race'. We review the results of genetic analyses that show that human genetic variation is geographically structured, in accord with historical patterns of gene flow and genetic drift. Analysis of many loci now yields reasonably accurate estimates of genetic similarity among individuals, rather than populations. Clustering of individuals is correlated with geographic origin or ancestry. These clusters are also correlated with some traditional concepts of race, but the correlations are imperfect because genetic variation tends to be distributed in a continuous, overlapping fashion among populations. Therefore, ancestry, or even race, may in some cases prove useful in the biomedical setting, but direct assessment of disease-related genetic variation will ultimately yield more accurate and beneficial information."

In this study, we have shown that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which is provoked under diabetic conditions, plays a crucial role in the insulin resistance found in diabetes by modifying the expression of oxygen-regulated protein 150 (ORP150), a molecular chaperone that protects cells from ER stress. Sense ORP overexpression in the liver of obese diabetic mice significantly improved insulin resistance and markedly ameliorated glucose tolerance. Conversely, expression of antisense ORP150 in the liver of normal mice decreased insulin sensitivity. The phosphorylation state of IRS-1 and Akt, which are key molecules for insulin signaling, and the expression levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase, key enzymes of gluconeogenesis, were also altered by ORP150 overexpression.

Here we report that ORP150 overexpression markedly improves insulin resistance and ameliorates glucose tolerance in diabetic animals, indicating that ER stress plays a crucial role in insulin resistance and could be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes.MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing sense ORP (Ad-S-ORP) and antisense ORP (Ad-AS-ORP) were prepared, and the adenovirus titers were increased up to 1 × 108 pfu/ml in the 293 cells. Adenovirus titers were further increased up to 1 × 1010 pfu/ml using Adeno-X™ virus purification kit (Clontech). Control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was also prepared in the same manner. Virus titers were estimated using an Adeno-X™ titer kit (Clontech).Animals and Administration of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Male C57BL6 and C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were purchased from Japan SLC. Mice (8 weeks old) were injected with Ad-S-ORP, Ad-AS-ORP, or Ad-GFP (1 × 1010 pfu/ml for Ad-S-ORP and 2 × 109 pfu/ml for Ad-AS-ORP) from the cervical vein. After adenovirus injection, blood glucose levels were measured regularly with a portable glucose meter (Glu-test Sensor; Sanwa) after tail snipping. For measurement of serum insulin levels, blood samples of mice after a 6-h fast were collected into heparinized capillary tubes and serum insulin levels were determined with an insulin-EIA test kit (Glazyme).Glucose Tolerance Tests—After a 6-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2.0 g/kg body weight). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0-120 min), and blood glucose levels and serum insulin levels were determined as described above.Insulin Tolerance Tests—After a 6-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (2.0 units/kg for C57BL-KsJ-db/db mice). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0-90 min), and blood glucose levels were measured as described above.Euglycemic Hyperinsulinemic Clamp—Fourteen days before the clamp study, Ad-S-ORP (1 × 1010 pfu/ml) or Ad-AS-ORP (2 × 109 pfu/ml) was injected from the left jugular vein. Three days before the clamp study, a silicon catheter (Phicon tube; Fuji-Systems) was inserted into the right jugular vein under general anesthesia with sodium pentobarbital. The catheter, which is required for infusion in the clamp study, was exteriorized at the back of the neck through a subcutaneous tunnel and filled with heparinized saline (200 units/ml). Clamp studies were performed on mice under conscious and unstressed conditions after a 6-h fast. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp with a tracer dilution method was applied to determine peripheral glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production. Experiments consisted of a 120-min euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp period (15 pmol/kg/min of regular human insulin for C57BL6 mice, 27 pmol/kg/min for C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice during the 120-min clamp period). During this period, blood glucose levels were monitored every 5 min and the rate of 50% glucose containing 10% [6,6-2H2]glucose infusion into the jugular vein was adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at 120 ± 10 mg/dl.Measurement of Endogenous Hepatic Glucose (HGP) Production by Stable Isotope-labeled Glucose Enrichment—To estimate HGP, stable isotope-labeled glucose enrichment was determined. Blood samples were taken at 90, 105, and 120 min, and 20 μl of each plasma sample were deproteinized with 60 μl of 99.5% ethanol. The supernatant was evaporated, and the residue was derivatized by the following procedure. First, 7.5 μl of MBTFA (N-methyl-bis (trifluoroacetamide); Pierce) and 7.5 μl of pyridine were added to the residue, and the mixture was heated for 1 h at 60 °C. The reaction product (1 μl) containing trifluoroacetylated glucose was then analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Model TSQ-700; Finningan-MAT) with a silicon S.E.-30 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm; Gasukuro Kogyo). The trifluoroacetyl derivative of glucose was separated from the other compounds by gas chromatography and was analyzed by electron impact mass spectrometry at 70 eV. The fragment ion peaks of unlabeled and [6,6-2H2]glucose were measured at a mass/electrical charge of 319 and 321, respectively.Western Blot Analysis and Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell extracts obtained from liver were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to reinforced cellulose nitrate membrane (Optitran BA-S85; Schleicher & Schuell). After blocking, the membranes were incubated at 4 °C overnight in TBS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) containing a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit anti-IRS-1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Akt, and anti-Akt-pSer473 antibody (Cell Signaling) and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS containing a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad). In addition, expression of the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of IRS-1 was examined by immunoprecipitation using anti-IRS-1 and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by incubation with LumiGLO (Cell Signaling) and exposed to light-sensitive film.Northern Blot Analysis—Ten micrograms of total RNA isolated from freeze-clamped liver tissues were electrophoresed on 1.0% formaldehyde-denatured agarose gel in 1 × MOPS running buffer and then transferred overnight to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose-6-phosphatase cDNA probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Rediprime labeling system kit (Amersham Biosciences). After overnight hybridization with a 32P-labeled probe at 42 °C, the membranes were washed in 2 × SSPE (saline/sodium phosphate/EDTA), 0.1% SDS at 42 °C. The probed membranes were exposed to an imaging plate, BAS-MS 2040 (Fujifilm), and the hybridization intensity was quantified using a BAS2500 system (Fujifilm).Statistical Analysis—Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the Student's t test or analysis of variance with the Fisher's test.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONORP150 Overexpression in the Liver Markedly Reduces Insulin Resistance and Ameliorates Glucose Tolerance in Obese Diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db Mice—First, to examine whether ER stress is increased in the liver under diabetic conditions, we evaluated ER stress levels in the livers of 10-week-old obese diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. Expression levels of KDEL and Bip, both of which are ER stress markers, were much higher in the obese diabetic mice compared with 10-week-old non-diabetic C57BL6 mice (Fig. 1A), indicating that ER stress is actually increased under diabetic conditions. To examine the effect of sense ORP150 overexpression on insulin resistance and diabetes, we prepared sense ORP150 expressing Ad-S-ORP (1 × 1010 pfu/ml) and a GFP-expressing control adenovirus (Ad-GFP) and delivered each adenovirus to 8-week-old C57BL/KsJ-db/db obese diabetic mice from the cervical vein. By Western blot analysis we confirmed an increase in ORP150 expression in the liver upon adenovirus injection (Fig. 1B), but not in other tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue (data not shown). In addition, expression levels of KDEL (GRP78/94) and Bip (GRP78) in Ad-S-ORP-treated mice were lower compared with those in Ad-GFP-treated db/db mice, indicating that ORP150 is actually acting to decrease ER stress in the liver (Fig. 1B). There was no difference in body weight and food intake between Ad-S-ORP-treated and Ad-GFP-treated-db/db mice (data not shown). When C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with Ad-S-ORP, nonfasting blood glucose levels were markedly reduced (Fig. 2A), whereas no such effects were observed in Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 2A) or in C57BL6 mice treated with Ad-S-ORP (data not shown). Fasting blood glucose concentrations (after a 6-h fast) were also significantly lower in Ad-S-ORP-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice, although there was no difference in plasma insulin concentrations between the two groups (Fig. 2B). To examine the effects of ORP150 overexpression in the liver on insulin resistance, we performed the intraperitoneal insulin tolerance test. The hypoglycemic response to insulin was larger in Ad-S-ORP-treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice than in Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 2C). To investigate this point further, we performed the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp test. Clamp studies were performed on mice under conscious and unstressed conditions after a 6-h fast. Experiments consisted of a 120-min euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp period (15 pmol/kg/min of regular human insulin for C57BL6 mice, 27 pmol/kg/min for C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice). Blood glucose levels were monitored every 5 min, and the rate of infusion of a 50% glucose solution containing 20% [6,6-2H2]glucose into the jugular vein was adjusted to maintain blood glucose concentrations at 110 ± 10 mg/dl. The glucose infusion rates (GIR) of Ad-S-ORP-treated mice were significantly higher compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (17.9 ± 3.7 versus 10.0 ± 2.8 mg/kg/min, p <0.05) (Fig. 2D), indicating that ORP150 overexpression in the liver reduces insulin resistance and thus ameliorates glucose tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice. We also evaluated endogenous hepatic glucose production (HGP) in Ad-S-ORP-treated mice using tracer methods. HGP was significantly lower in Ad-S-ORP-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (9.5 ± 3.0 versus 18.0 ± 4.5 mg/kg/min, p <0.05) (Fig. 2D). These results indicate that the reduction of insulin resistance and amelioration of glucose tolerance by Ad-S-ORP overexpression are mainly because of the suppression of HGP.Fig. 2Effects of adenoviral sense ORP overexpression in the liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice.A, nonfasting blood glucose levels in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice treated with Ad-S-ORP or Ad-GFP (n = 6).

By Western blot analysis we confirmed a decrease in ORP150 expression in the liver upon adenovirus injection (Fig. 1B). In addition, expression levels of KDEL in Ad-AS-ORP-treated mice were higher than those in Ad-GFP-treated C57BL6 mice, although there was no difference in Bip expression levels (Fig. 1B). There was no difference in body weight and food intake between the two groups (data not shown). In addition, although there was no difference in nonfasting blood glucose levels (Fig. 3A) and in fasting blood glucose and serum insulin levels between Ad-AS-ORP-treated and Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 3B), the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test revealed that glucose tolerance is markedly worsened upon antisense ORP150 expression (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, in the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study, the GIR of Ad-AS-ORP-treated C57BL6 mice were significantly lower compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (34.3 ± 3.5 versus 64.4 ± 6.3 mg/kg/min, p <0.05) (Fig. 3D), indicating that ER stress in the liver reduces insulin sensitivity in C57BL6 mice. Furthermore, we evaluated HGP in Ad-AS-ORP-treated mice using tracer methods. HGP in Ad-AS-ORP-treated mice was significantly greater than in Ad-GFP-treated mice (18.6 ± 2.1 versus 5.8 ± 2.0 mg/kg/min, p <0.05) (Fig. 3D). These results indicate that antisense ORP150 expression decreases insulin sensitivity at least in part by increasing HGP in non-diabetic mice.Fig. 3Effects of adenoviral antisense ORP overexpression in the liver on insulin resistance and glucose tolerance in C57BL6 mice.A, nonfasting blood glucose levels in C57BL6 mice treated with Ad-AS-ORP or Ad-GFP (n = 6).

IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was markedly increased in Ad-S-ORP-treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 4A). Concomitantly, an increase in Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was observed in Ad-S-ORP-treated C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 4A). In contrast, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased in Ad-AS-ORP-treated mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 4A). A decrease in Akt serine 473 phosphorylation was observed in Ad-AS-ORP-treated C57BL6 mice compared with Ad-GFP-treated mice (Fig. 4A). We next examined the expression levels of the key gluconeogenic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), both of which are known to be regulated by insulin signaling. The expression of both PEPCK and G6Pase was markedly decreased by Ad-S-ORP treatment in C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice (Fig. 4B). In contrast, expression of both enzymes was increased upon treatment with Ad-AS-ORP in C57BL6 mice (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that reduction of ER stress enhances insulin signaling, which leads to a decrease in gluconeogenesis and amelioration of glucose tolerance.Fig. 4Effects of sense and antisense ORP overexpression on insulin signaling and gluconeogenesis in the liver.A, effects of ER stress on insulin signaling. C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were treated with Ad-S-ORP or Ad-GFP, and C57BL6 mice were treated with Ad-AS-ORP or Ad-GFP. Two weeks after the adenovirus injection, the expression of total and tyrosine-phophorylated forms of IRS-1 and total and phophorylated forms (Ser-473) of Akt were examined by Western blot analysis. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. B, effects of ER stress on gluconeogenesis.

ER stress could thus be a potential therapeutic target for diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is one of the most prevalent and serious metabolic diseases in the world, and insulin resistance and pancreatic β-cell dysfunction are the hallmarks of the disease (1Saltiel A.R.

MATERIALS AND METHODSPreparation of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Recombinant adenoviruses expressing sense ORP (Ad-S-ORP) and antisense ORP (Ad-AS-ORP) were prepared, and the adenovirus titers were increased up to 1 × 108 pfu/ml in the 293 cells. Adenovirus titers were further increased up to 1 × 1010 pfu/ml using Adeno-X™ virus purification kit (Clontech). Control adenovirus expressing green fluorescent protein (Ad-GFP) was also prepared in the same manner. Virus titers were estimated using an Adeno-X™ titer kit (Clontech).Animals and Administration of Recombinant Adenoviruses—Male C57BL6 and C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice were purchased from Japan SLC. Mice (8 weeks old) were injected with Ad-S-ORP, Ad-AS-ORP, or Ad-GFP (1 × 1010 pfu/ml for Ad-S-ORP and 2 × 109 pfu/ml for Ad-AS-ORP) from the cervical vein. After adenovirus injection, blood glucose levels were measured regularly with a portable glucose meter (Glu-test Sensor; Sanwa) after tail snipping. For measurement of serum insulin levels, blood samples of mice after a 6-h fast were collected into heparinized capillary tubes and serum insulin levels were determined with an insulin-EIA test kit (Glazyme).Glucose Tolerance Tests—After a 6-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (2.0 g/kg body weight). Blood samples were taken at various time points (0-120 min), and blood glucose levels and serum insulin levels were determined as described above.Insulin Tolerance Tests—After a 6-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with insulin (2.0 units/kg for C57BL-KsJ-db/db mice).

Inactivation of JunB in postnatal mice results in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) resembling early human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Here, we show that JunB regulates the numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). JunB overexpression decreases the frequency of long-term HSC (LT-HSC), while JunB inactivation specifically expands the numbers of LT-HSC and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors (GMP) resulting in chronic MPD. Further, we demonstrate that junB inactivation must take place in LT-HSC, and not at later stages of myelopoiesis, to induce MPD and that only junB-deficient LT-HSC are capable of transplanting the MPD to recipient mice. These results demonstrate a stem cell-specific role for JunB in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis and provide experimental evidence that leukemic stem cells (LSC) can reside at the LT-HSC stage of development in a mouse model of MPD."

Infection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is problematic in hospitals because the organism often infects immunocompromised patients and threatens their life. The underlying problem in the infection of this organism is that the bacterium shows both natural and mutational resistance to structurally and functionally dissimilar xenobiotics-antibiotics (1Li X.Z.

This low specific antibiotic resistance is mainly attributable to the interplay of the multidrug exporter(s) and tight outer membrane barrier (5Nikaido H. Science. 1996; 264: 221-229Google Scholar, 6Nakae T. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 39: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa encodes several resistance nodulation cell division-type transporters, and among them, the MexAB-OprM multidrug transporter plays a central role in intrinsic multidrug resistance of this organism (2Morshed S.R.

Upon mutation of the regulatory gene, mexR, the cell produces large amounts of MexAB-OprM rendering the bacterium severalfold more resistant to the same spectrum of antibiotics than the wild-type strain (4Rella M.

The MexAB-OprM transporter consists of three subunit proteins, MexA, MexB, and OprM, located in the inner, inner, and the outer membrane, respectively (2Morshed S.R. Lei Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 9Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J.

MexB selects substrates and exports them by the expenditure of the energy of proton gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane (10Lei Y. Sato K. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1043-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). MexA, which is the inner membrane-anchored lipoprotein exposing the entire protein moiety to the periplasmic space, is assumed to cross-bridge the MexB and OprM subunits (3Poole K. Heinrichs D.E.

Recently, the crystal structure of the MexA subunit has been resolved at the 2.40-Å resolution, revealing that the long extended protein structure consists of three main domains and possibly one more disordered domain (12Akama H. Matsuura T. Kashiwagi S. Yoneyama H. Tsukihara T. Nakagawa A. Narita S-I. Nakae T. J. Biol.

OprM is the outer membrane-associated lipoprotein that is important in the final stage of antibiotic ejection across the outer membrane (9Poole K. Krebes K. McNally C. Neshat S. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7363-7372Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 14Nakajima A. Sugimoto Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30064-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In fact, permeability measurements by means of a planar lipid bilayer and the liposome swelling assay reported that OprM forms the channel that allows the diffusion of small solutes (15Wong K.K.Y. Brinkman F.S.L. Benz R.S. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Yoshihara E. Maseda H. Saito K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4738-4745Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The OprM protein lacking an amino-terminal cysteine residue and consequently lacking all of the fatty acids was predominantly recovered from the periplasmic space but only slightly recovered from the outer membrane fraction (14Nakajima A. Sugimoto Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30064-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The TolC protein of Escherichia coli is a functional homologue of OprM in that the presence of TolC is a prerequisite for xenobiotic export by the AcrAB efflux pump, although the protein showed only 21% amino acid identity with OprM (15Wong K.K.Y. Brinkman F.S.L. Benz R.S. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of TolC had been resolved and the results revealed that the protein consisted mainly of two domains: one is the β-barrel structure by which the protein anchored the outer membrane and another is a long α-helical barrel that was extended to the periplasmic space (17Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Both ends of TolC had a pore opening through which small solutes may diffuse. The OprM protein differs from TolC: (i) the amino-terminal end of the OprM was fatty acid modified (3Poole K. Heinrichs D.E. Neshat S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 529-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 14Nakajima A. Sugimoto Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30064-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), whereas TolC has no such modification, and (ii) OprM functions only for xenobiotic discharge, while TolC is a multifunctional export protein engaged in protein export and small xenobiotic extrusion (18Paulsen I.T. Park J.H. Choi P.S. Saier Jr., MH FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 156: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To envisage the structure of this important transporter subunit and advance the understanding of how the pump assembly functions, we present the x-ray crystallographic structure of OprM. All the materials used and experimental procedures are given in the supplemental materials section. Structure of the OpM Monomer—The mature form of OprM containing 468 amino acid residues and NH2-terminal fatty acids was crystallized in the presence of a surfactant mixture, and diffraction data were obtained using synchrotron radiation. The current model of OprM consisted of 456 residues comprising 97.4% of the total amino acid residues. The OprM monomer consisted of four β-strands and eight α-helices (Fig. 1, A and B). β-Strands were organized in a single β-sheet cluster by the antiparallel configuration. The α-helix cluster mainly consisted of two long α-helices (67 and 69 residues) and four short helices (23 and 36 residues) with the anti-parallel configuration. Tandem joining of two short α-helices formed one set of α-helix similar in size and shape with a single long α-helix. The periplasmic end of the short α-helix H8 was buried in the two long α-helical ends. Assembly of two long α-helices and two sets of short α-helices per monomer were configured as if four long α-helices were in a bundle. The fatty acid-modified NH2-terminal end was located at the interface of α-helix and β-sheet clusters near Phe297 and Phe129. The β-sheet and α-helix clusters were connected by four short loops consisting of two to four amino acid residues. There was a 110° turn at the junction of the β-strand and α-helix clusters, thereby changing their orientation toward the same direction and consequently forming a sickle shape. The aromatic amino acids, such as Phe85, Phe129, Phe296, Phe297, and Phe335, at this region participated in the precise change of strand direction at the junctions, H2-S1, S2-H3, H6-S3, and S4-H7, respectively. Overall Structure of the Trimer—Two OprM monomers were contained in cystallographic asymmetric unit and each monomers consisted trimeric structures, which were related crystallographic 3-fold (Fig. 1A). The overall structure is reminiscent of the TolC trimer of E. coli (17Koronakis V. Sharff A. Koronakis E. Luisi B. Hughes C. Nature. 2000; 405: 914-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Longitudinal and latitudinal dimensions of the OprM trimer appeared to be 135 and 40–75 Å, respectively. The trimer consisted mainly of two domains: a β-barrel with a size of about 35 (height) × 40–55 (width) Å and an α-barrel with a length of about 100 Å. Each β-sheet was tilted about 55° perpendicular to the plane of the membrane, twisted rightwards, and extending to two-thirds the distance along the β-barrel forming the barrel wall and a central pore. Near the top of the β-barrel, there were three short loops; they protruded toward the inside of the pore forming a constriction. The pore diameter was calculated to be about 6–8 Å at the constriction, which is much smaller than that of TolC (Fig. 2A). The β-barrel is likely inserted into the outer membrane matrix, analogous to the consensus β-barrel structure of most integral outer membrane proteins of Gram-negative bacteria (19Wimley W.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 404-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The surface of the β-barrel is hydrophobic and both ends of the β-barrel are positively charged (data not shown), and these electrostatic and hydrophobic features of the β-barrel strongly support the above hypothesis. The α-barrel was formed by a bundle of 6 long α-helices and 12 short α-helices. Right-hand twists of α-helices toward the proximal ends narrowed the barrel end and spontaneously formed a bulge near the equator. Thus, the interior of the trimer formed a huge and long cavity along the longitudinal axis, with a volume of ∼25,000 Å3, which was probably filled with solvents. The cavity was gradually constricted along the proximal end and was totally closed at the tip (Fig. 2, A and B). This structure seems plausible, since the ground state of OprM should not allow access of xenobiotics to the interior of the cells. Inlet and Outlet of the Cavity—The pore opening observed in the β-barrel with a diameter of about 6–8 Å, which is not large enough to accommodate the passage of any antibiotics (Fig. 2A). The periplasmic end of the α-barrel was tightly sealed, possibly not allowing the passage of any molecules in the ground state (Fig. 2, A and B). A question to be answered is how the β-barrel pore can be dilated. The crystal structure showed two OprM molecules in different environment (Fig. 3A). Although all the amino acid residues in the β-barrel of the A unit could be traced, a large part of that of the B unit showed disordered structure (Fig. 3A). The results suggest that the upper part of the β-barrel is flexible. This assumption was supported by the fact that the β-barrel of one of the molecules in a crystal (molecule B in Fig. 3A) shows extremely high temperature factors (Fig. 3A). The β-barrel contained 18 residues of proline per trimer, which is known to have a tendency to break the protein secondary structure and 33 residues of glycine per trimer that confers fragility on the protein structure (Fig. 3B). An even greater problem would be the periplasmic end of the α-barrel through which antibiotics may be injected into the OprM cavity. The α-helices at the periplasmic end were twisted causing closure of the cavity end. The gate was constructed by stacking of hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and hydrophilic amino acid networks (supplemental Fig. 1) that is flexible as shown by the high temperature factors (Fig. 3). The hydrophobic gate was formed by the triplet of Leu412 that may not allow the passage of even a water molecule (Fig. 2B). Two hydrophilic layers were constructed by Asp416–Arg419 and Asn410–Thr413 that sandwiched the hydrophobic layer (supplemental Fig. 1). This tightly sealed α-barrel end must be opened to allow the entry of antibiotics. Proposal for the Mechanism of Opening the Closed Periplasmic End—The proximal end of the OprM α-barrel was tightly sealed by the inward twisting of helices 7 and 8, while helices 3 and 4 were positioned outside and interacted with MexB (Fig. 1A). This inward twisting seems to be maintained by strong intra- and intermolecular hydrogen bonding resulting in a turn of H7 and H8 at Gly377 and Val440, respectively. If these turned α-helices could be linear, the periplasmic gate of the α-barrel could be opened. Hinges of this door are likely located near the equator of helices 7 and 8. The α-carbon of Arg376 and Gly377 of helix 7 and Glu439 and Val440 of helix 8 are aligned linearly; their 18° outward tilting at the hinges causes movement of the occluding Leu412 α-carbon 9.8 Å outward resulting in opening of a pore with a diameter of 11 Å or more (supplemental Fig. 4, movement of helices 7 and 8 of the cyan α-helices to the magenta α-helices). The model cannot predict the force that pulls out helices 7 and 8. Since OprM most likely interacts with MexB at the tip of helices 3 and 4, helices 7 and 8 are free from contact with MexB (see below). It is tempting to predict that this task may take place with the MexA subunit rather than MexB. A mechanism for the periplasmic pore dilation of the TolC trimer has been proposed that modification of the salt bridges at the tip of the periplasmic end enlarges the pore (20Andersen C. Bokma E. Eswaran J. Humphreys D. Hughes C. Oronakis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11103-11108Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, the proposal did not consider possible involvement of the cognate subunit proteins such as AcrA and AcrB. The model proposed for pore opening of OprM is not mutually exclusive with that of TolC of E. coli. Further experimental data are needed to verify these models. Membrane Anchoring—The amino-terminal cysteine residue of the OprM protein was fatty acid-modified. Removal of acyl chains had little effect on the function of OprM, although the majority of delipidated OprM had been recovered from the periplasmic space (14Nakajima A. Sugimoto Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30064-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Based on this result, we hypothesized that OprM might anchor the outer membrane solely via the acyl chains (14Nakajima A. Sugimoto Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30064-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure did not support this conclusion and revealed that OprM anchors the outer membrane by two modes: via the NH2-terminal fatty acids and the transmembrane β-barrel. The x-ray crystallography showed a poorly resolved density map beyond the amino-terminal Cys 1S. Eda and T. Nakae, manuscript in preparation. residue suggesting that this might be the fatty acid moiety (supplemental Fig. 2). The occurrence and structural clarification of a membrane protein that has two modes of membrane anchoring was a new finding to the best of our knowledge, although such a possibility was suggested in the outer membrane component of the capsular polysaccharide transport machinery in E. coli (21Drummelsmith J. Whitfield C. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It would be of interest to address the physiological relevance of two modes of membrane anchoring. OprM has extremely large and hydrophilic surface areas, an external surface and internal cavity wall, which may need an additional membrane anchoring device to ensure transmembrane anchoring of the drug discharge duct (Fig. 2). This hypothesis was supported by the fact that the delipidated OprM was largely located in the periplasmic space (14Nakajima A. Sugimoto Y. Yoneyama H. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30064-30068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and by the structural fragility of the β-barrel (Fig. 3B). Alternatively, it is also possible that fatty acids play a role in the proper sorting of OprM to the outer membrane as documented in the E. coli Lol system (22Yakushi T. Masuda K. Narita S. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Nature Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The fact that OprM lacks a carboxyl-terminal outer membrane sorting signal, i.e. Phe-X-Phe (COOH-terminal) (23Struyve M. Moons M. Tommassen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), supports the above notion. However, TolC has neither a COOH-terminal outer membrane-sorting signal nor a NH2-terminal fatty acid modification, yet the protein was properly sorted to the outer membrane. Interaction of OprM with Cognate Subunits MexA and MexB—In vivo interaction of OprM with MexA and MexB has been demonstrated by co-purification of non-tagged MexA and MexB with his-tagged OprM (24Mokhonov V.V. Mokhonova E.I. Akama H. Nakae T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and by a chemical cross-linking experiment (25Nehme D. Li X.Z. Elliot R. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recently proposed MexAB-OprM assembly models showed that the coiled-coil domain of MexA interacts with OprM and both β- and α+β-domains interact with MexB (12Akama H. Matsuura T. Kashiwagi S. Yoneyama H. Tsukihara T. Nakagawa A. Narita S-I. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25939-25942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 13Higgins M.K. Bokma E. Koronakis E. Hughes C. Koronakis V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 9994-9999Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In fact, domain swapping experiments among P. aeruginosa membrane fusion protein revealed that the coiled-coil domain reserves the outer membrane selective determinant. 1S. Eda and T. Nakae, manuscript in preparation. In addition, a genetic experiment revealed that function-restored secondary mutations that complement functionally compromised TolC of E. coli were predominantly mapped in the α+β-domain of AcrA (26Gerken H. Misra R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 54: 620-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggesting that the α+β-domain of AcrA may interact with TolC. Adopting these observations to explain the MexAB-OprM assembly, we revised the assembly model as follows. The OprM α-barrel provides at least two MexA binding sites: one for the coiled-coil α-helical domain and one for the α+β-domain. The next question for consideration is how OprM interacts with MexB. We constructed an OprM-MexB fitting model based on the OprM crystal structure and the simulated MexB model. The computer-aided manual search of close proximity and best fitting of the periplasmic end of the OprM to the distal end of the MexB funnel top found hydrophobic contact between these two subunits (Fig. 4). An array of hydrophobic amino acid residues of OprM, Val198-Gly199-Val200 (a loop between H3 and H4), provides perfect contact with an array of Ala736-Leu737-Gly738 of MexB (supplemental Fig. 3). Three hydrophobic contact sites in the OprM-MexB trimer strengthen the subunit interaction and contribute to the MexAB-OprM pump assembly. This contact may be maintained in either the closed or open state of the periplasmic end, because Val198-Gly199-Val200 is less likely to be involved in gate formation (supplemental Fig. 4). Arrays of hydrophobic amino acids found in OprM and MexB are also conserved in TolC and AcrB, respectively. The MexA-MexB interaction is likely to occur at the disordered domain of MexA and the funnel domain of MexB. This assumption was supported by the earlier observation (25Nehme D. Li X.Z. Elliot R. Poole K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 2973-2983Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 27Elkins C.A. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5349-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The remaining question is whether or not the 25 amino-terminal residues of MexA that are extended toward the outside of the α+β-domain can reach the inner membrane. This short peptide consisted of a short β-sheet and a random coil that is most likely extended by a distance of about 50 Å toward the inner membrane and is long enough to reach the inner membrane. Fatty acids attached to this NH2-terminal end must be inserted into the hydrophobic domain of the inner membrane. We are grateful to the beam line staff member, E. Yamashita of SPing8 BL44XU, and Dr. H. Sakai of Osaka University for his advice in the initial stage of this study. Download .pdf (.1 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2002871809,"Skin pigmentation is a central element of most discussions on 'race' and genetics. Research on the genetic basis of population variation in this phenotype, which is important in mediating both social experiences and environmental exposures, is sparse. We studied the relationship between pigmentation and ancestry in five populations of mixed ancestry with a wide range of pigmentation and ancestral proportions (African Americans from Washington, DC; African Caribbeans living in England; Puerto Ricans from New York; Mexicans from Guerrero; and Hispanics from San Luis Valley). The strength of the relationship between skin color and ancestry was quite variable, with the correlations ranging in intensity from moderately strong (Puerto Rico, rho = 0.633) to weak (Mexico, rho = 0.212). These results demonstrate the utility of ancestry-informative genetic markers and admixture methods and emphasize the need to be cautious when using pigmentation as a proxy of ancestry or when extrapolating the results from one admixed population to another."
https://openalex.org/W2162658917,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase required for signaling from immunoreceptors in various hematopoietic cells. Phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues in the activation loop of the Syk kinase catalytic domain is necessary for signaling, a phenomenon typical of tyrosine kinase family members. Syk in vitro enzyme activity, however, does not depend on phosphorylation (activation loop tyrosine → phenylalanine mutants retain catalytic activity). We have determined the x-ray structure of the unphosphorylated form of the kinase catalytic domain of Syk. The enzyme adopts a conformation of the activation loop typically seen only in activated, phosphorylated tyrosine kinases, explaining why Syk does not require phosphorylation for activation. We also demonstrate that Gleevec (STI-571, Imatinib) inhibits the isolated kinase domains of both unphosphorylated Syk and phosphorylated Abl with comparable potency. Gleevec binds Syk in a novel, compact cis-conformation that differs dramatically from the binding mode observed with unphosphorylated Abl, the more Gleevec-sensitive form of Abl. This finding suggests the existence of two distinct Gleevec binding modes: an extended, trans-conformation characteristic of tight binding to the inactive conformation of a protein kinase and a second compact, cis-conformation characteristic of weaker binding to the active conformation. Finally, the Syk-bound cis-conformation of Gleevec bears a striking resemblance to the rigid structure of the nonspecific, natural product kinase inhibitor staurosporine.

Syk family members include two human proteins, Syk (spleen tyrosine kinase) and its closest relative Zap-70 (70-kDa ζ chain-associated protein). Syk and Zap-70 are non-receptor tyrosine kinases characterized by two N-terminal SH2 adapter domains, a linker region, and a C-terminal catalytic domain. Syk and Zap-70 share similar functions in the transduction of immunoreceptor signals. Antigen binding to immunoreceptors leads to phosphorylation of two tyrosine side chains in the cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif. Phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif recruits either Syk or Zap-70 via their SH2 domains (for a review see Ref. 1Latour S. Veillette A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2001; 13: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Syk operates downstream of the B-cell receptor in B-cells, the IgE receptor FcϵRI in mast cells, FcγR in macrophages (2Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol.

Knock-out mouse studies have shown that Syk is essential for lymphocyte development (2Turner M. Schweighoffer E. Colucci F. Di Santo J.P. Tybulewicz V.L. Immunol.

Syk has attracted particular interest as a therapeutic target for treatment of asthma, because Syk-deficient mast cells do not degranulate in response to FcϵRI aggregation (5Zhang J. Berenstein E.H.

Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) gave rise to a model of conformational transition upon activation in kinases. In this model, the preactivated conformation is characterized by activation loop occlusion of the ATP- and/or substrate-binding sites (“loop in”), effectively preventing substrate access. Phosphorylation stabilizes an open conformation of the activation loop (“loop out”) that does not occlude the substrate-binding sites and is compatible with catalysis (11Hubbard S.R. Till J.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar, 12Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). In the loop-out conformation, the activation loop also forms a platform for peptide substrate docking (12Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). In addition to permitting access to the substrate-binding sites and formation of the peptide docking site, the extruded conformation of the activation loop appears to be important for ensuring appropriate orientation of the catalytic machinery, including the catalytic loop, the aspartate residue of the “DFG” motif, and a salt bridge formed between conserved lysine and glutamate side chains.In some kinases, it is possible that the loop-out arrangement represents a stable conformation in the absence of phosphorylation and that the major role of phosphorylation is to destabilize the loop-in conformation. Indirect support for this hypothesis comes from identification of many activating mutations within the activation loop that appear to function by destabilizing the loop-in conformation (13Wan P.T. Garnett M.J. Roe S.M. Lee S. Niculescu-Duvaz D. Good V.M. Jones C.M. Marshall C.J. Springer C.J. Barford D. Marais R. Project C.G.

Moreover, some tyrosine kinases, such as Syk and epidermal growth factor receptor, do not require tyrosine phosphorylation for high level enzyme activity (15Gotoh N. Tojo A. Hino M. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 768-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 16Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hottori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yzaki Y.

Despite the absence of activation loop phosphorylation, we find that the activation loop of dephospho-Syk adopts the more active loop-out conformation.The less active loop-in conformation creates an extended ATP-binding pocket, which is exploited by a number of kinase inhibitors (18Schindler T. Sicheri F. Pico A. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Kuriyan J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 639-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 19Pargellis C. Tong L. Churchill L. Cirillo P.F. Gilmore T. Graham A.G. Grob P.M. Hickey E.R. Moss N. Pav S. Regan J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). For example, Gleevec binds to the ATP-binding site of unphosphorylated Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) by accessing this extended pocket, which is not compatible with the more active, loop-out conformation (20Schindler T. Bornmann W. Pellicena P. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 21Nagar B. Hantschel O. Young M.A. Scheffzek K. Veach D.

This finding explains the weaker binding of Gleevec to Tyr393 phosphorylated Abl. We also report the structure of Gleevec bound to Syk, which shows how Gleevec uses a novel compact conformation that resembles staurosporine to bind to a protein kinase domain in the active conformation. This work may serve as a model for the binding mode of Gleevec to the phosphorylated, activated form of Abl.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression/Purification—The coding sequence for the Syk kinase domain (Syk-KD, residues 356-635) was TOPO-isomerase ligated into a GATEWAY (Invitrogen) adapted pcDNA6 AttB HisC vector. The resulting open reading frame encodes MAL-Syk356-635-EGHHHHHH, where the N-terminal Met-Ala-Leu tripeptide and the C-terminal EGHHHHHH octapeptide originate from the expression vector. After constructing the corresponding bacmid, the protein was expressed in Sf9 cells in a 48-h infection at 27 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and frozen at -80 °C.After thawing at room temperature, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mm arginine, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) Igepal 630 and centrifuged to remove cell debris. The soluble fraction was purified using immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted under native conditions with a step gradient of 400 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 10 mm methionine, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. The resulting protein was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mm methionine, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Fractions containing purified Syk-KD were pooled and concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml. The apo form of Syk-KD obtained using this procedure was typically >98% pure as judged by mass spectrometry, which also documented that it is neither proteolyzed nor phosphorylated. The Syk-staurosporine complex was purified as above except that staurosporine was added to a final concentration of 2.5 μm to the cell lysate.Crystallization/Crystallography—Crystals of Syk-KD were grown at 4 °C via sitting drop vapor diffusion against a reservoir containing 10-25% (v/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 100 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.5) (1 μl of protein (10-15 mg/ml) in a storage buffer, consisting of 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm methionine mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution). For the apo Syk crystals, AMP-PNP 1The abbreviation used is: AMP-PNP, adenosine 5′-(β,γ-iminotriphosphate). and MgCl2 were added to final concentrations of 1 and 2 mm, respectively. AMP-PNP and MgCl2 reduced background precipitation but were not necessary for crystal growth, nor were they visible in the final electron density. Similar behavior was reported for Zap-70 incubated with AMP-PCP (22Jin L. Pluskey S. Petrella E.C. Cantin S.M. Gorga J.C. Rynkiewicz M.J. Pandey P. Strickler J.E. Babine R.E. Weaver D.T. Seidl K.J.

For preparation of Syk-Gleevec crystals, Gleevec was added to the protein to a final concentration of 1 mm 1 h before crystallization using the strategy outlined above. Syk-staurosporine crystals were also prepared as above. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant consisting of 85% reservoir solution and 15% (v/v) glycerol. After 2 min, the crystals were collected and frozen by rapid immersion in liquid nitrogen.X-ray diffraction data were collected under standard cryogenic conditions at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory) using the SGX-CAT beamline and reduced to structure factor amplitudes using MOSFLM, SCALA, and TRUNCATE (23Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr.

The structure of Syk-KD was determined via molecular replacement using the structure of the Abl kinase domain (Protein Data Bank code 1IEP) (24Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T.

The resulting atomic model was refined using REFMAC (23Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

The structures of Gleevec and staurosporine bound Syk were determined as above using the apo Syk-KD structure as the molecular replacement search model.

Each 50-μl reaction mixture contained 50-100 ng of purified kinase domain, 2.5 μl of test compound at various concentrations dissolved in pure Me2SO, 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, 300 μm NADH, 45 units/ml pyruvate kinase, 60 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, and phospho-acceptor substrate (1 mg/ml poly EY 4:1 for Syk or 200 mm EAIYAAPFAKKK peptide for Abl). The enzyme reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP to a final concentration of 10 μm. Reaction progress was followed by measuring the decrease in the absorbance at 340 nm versus time. The IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of a 12-point dilution series of the compound in the assay described above using Equation 1,y=[(max−min)/(1+10logIC50−x)]+min(Eq. 1) where y is the measured activity; max and min are the activities associated with lack of inhibition and total inhibition, respectively; IC50 is the inhibitor concentration that reduces the activity by 50%; x is the logarithm of the inhibitor concentration. The Ki values were estimated from the IC50 values using Equation 2.IC50=Ki(1+[ATP]/Km)(Eq. 2) RESULTSUnphosphorylated Syk Adopts an Active Conformation—The Syk kinase domain has a subdomain structure typical of other kinases, with a largely β-sheet N-terminal lobe, a largely α-helical C-terminal lobe, and the active site sandwiched between the two lobes. The N-terminal lobe consists of a five-stranded β-sheet plus a single α-helix equivalent to the C-helix of PKA (27Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2262) Google Scholar). The larger C-terminal lobe is predominantly α-helical with three short β-strands: one at the hinge region and two between the activation loop and the main body of the C-lobe.As discussed above, several extant structures of both active and inactive forms of tyrosine kinases gave rise to a model of kinase regulation in which the activation loop undergoes substantial conformational changes upon phosphorylation. The Syk-KD protein sample that yielded our initial structure was not phosphorylated, as judged by mass spectrometry, and the electron density of the activation loop tyrosine residues showed no evidence of added phosphate groups. Nevertheless, the Syk-KD adopts a loop-out conformation similar to that seen in active, phosphorylated protein kinases. In an α-carbon backbone structural alignment of Syk and the activated Lck kinase domain Tyr526 of Syk aligns with phosphoTyr394 of Lck (Fig. 1) (10Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). The orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains of Syk is the same as that observed in Lck. Within the Syk structure the substrate (ATP and peptide)-binding sites are accessible, and the “DFG” motif at the N-terminal base of the activation loop adopts the DFG-in conformation (19Pargellis C. Tong L. Churchill L. Cirillo P.F. Gilmore T. Graham A.G. Grob P.M. Hickey E.R. Moss N. Pav S. Regan J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 268-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar), with Asp512 appropriately positioned for catalysis (Fig. 1). Similarly, Asp494 of the catalytic loop and the remainder of the catalytic machinery is organized as in the more active form of Lck, including formation of the conserved Glu-Lys salt bridge (Fig. 1).Gleevec Adopts a Novel Conformation upon Syk Binding—The more active, loop-out/DFG-in conformation of apo Syk precludes binding of Gleevec in the trans-conformation observed for binding to the inactive form of Abl (Fig. 2) (24Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar), because in the DFG-in conformation the phenylalanine occludes a secondary binding site accessed by Gleevec. Our structure of active, phosphorylated Abl also exhibits occlusion of the secondary binding site by the DFG phenylalanine (Fig. 2). 2S. Atwell, M. D. Buchanan, B. C. Leon, G. Lovie, K. R. Rajashankar, and S. G. Buchanan, unpublished observations. We, therefore, determined the structure of the Gleevec-bound form of Syk to understand how Gleevec binds an activated kinase. To our surprise, the Syk kinase domain remains unchanged in the Syk-Gleevec complex, but the Gleevec molecule adopts a novel cis-conformation, quite unlike the trans-conformation it adopts in binding to the inactive form of Abl (Fig. 2). In the trans-conformation the piperazine ring extends into the secondary binding pocket, made accessible by the DFG phenylalanine adopting the out position (Fig. 2). In the cis-conformation the orientation is reversed with the aromatic rings of Gleevec forming a U shape in the active site with the piperazine ring extending out into solvent (Fig. 2).Fig. 2Stereo view of alternate Gleevec binding modes. Gleevec bound to unphosphorylated Abl (green) adopts an extended, trans-confirmation, which is incompatible with the phosphorylated/more active confirmation of Abl (blue). Gleevec binds to the unphosphorylated/active confirmation of Syk (yellow) in a very different cis-conformation, which is more compatible with binding to the phosphorylated/more active conformation of Abl (blue). The key residues are labeled.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Intermolecular interactions responsible for Gleevec binding to Syk include hydrogen bonds, van der Waals' interactions, and a bridging water molecule (Fig. 3). To our surprise N-10 and N-13 of Gleevec form hydrogen bonds with the backbone nitrogen and oxygen of Ala451 in the hinge region of the kinase (N-N-10 = 3.0 Å; O-N-13 = 3.3 Å) (Fig. 4A). In the Abl-Gleevec co-crystal structure, the nitrogen of Met318 (equivalent to Ala451 of Syk) interacts with N-3 of Gleevec (N-N-3 = 2.9 Å). The residues involved in van der Waals' interactions (<4 Å) between Syk and Gleevec include: Leu377, Ser379, Val385, Ala400, Met448, Glu449, Met450, Glu452, Gly454, Pro455, and Leu501. Gleevec N3 forms a hydrogen bond with an ordered water molecule (3.0 Å), which interacts with another ordered water and the backbone of Asp512. Three other ordered waters form a network of hydrogen bonds with Syk and van der Waals' interactions with Gleevec.Fig. 3A, schematic of Gleevec-Syk interactions.

Science. 2000; 289: 1938-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar, 24Nagar B. Bornmann W.G. Pellicena P. Schindler T. Veach D.R. Miller W.T. Clarkson B. Kuriyan J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4236-4243PubMed Google Scholar). In routine assays of Syk-KD, we demonstrated that Gleevec shows only modest potency against Syk. The inhibition constant, Ki, of Gleevec for the phosphorylated form of Abl is similar to the Ki we observe with unphosphorylated Syk-KD. We measured Gleevec inhibition of purified forms of Syk, Abl-0P, and Abl-1P (purification procedures for Abl-0P and Abl-1P will be published elsewhere). Gleevec inhibits Syk with a Ki value of 5.0 μm. The Ki for Gleevec inhibition of Abl-1P is of a similar order of magnitude (0.9 μm), whereas the Ki for Gleevec inhibition of Abl-0P is 0.014 μm. Staurosporine inhibits Syk with an IC50 value of 0.012 μm (data not shown).Visual inspection of our Syk-Gleevec co-crystal structure suggests that the amine lying between the pyrimidine and benzene rings of Gleevec forms a somewhat strained hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of Ala451. Strain appears to result from interactions between the methyl group of the benzene ring and the carbonyl oxygen of Glu452. The presence of this methyl group improves the specificity of Gleevec for Abl versus other kinases (28Zimmermann J. Buchdunger E. Mett H. Meyer T. Lydon N.B. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1997; 7: 187-192Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Removal of this methyl group, and hence any energetic penalty resulting from such strain, would be expected to improve the affinity of Gleevec for Syk. Indeed, the demethyl form of Gleevec is a more potent inhibitor of Syk than Gleevec (Ki = 0.160 μm). 2S. Atwell, M. D. Buchanan, B. C. Leon, G. Lovie, K. R. Rajashankar, and S. G. Buchanan, unpublished observations.The Gleevec cis-Conformation Resembles Staurosporine—The structure of Gleevec bound to Syk in the cis-conformation closely resembles the structure of staurosporine bound to Syk (Fig. 4). The pyridine and pyrimidine aromatic rings of Gleevec sit in the adenine pocket sandwiched between the side chains of Leu377, Val385, and Ala400 on one face and Pro455 and Leu501 on the other. The nitrogen of the pyrimidine ring (N-10) serves as the canonical hydrogen bond acceptor to the Ala451 backbone nitrogen donor, which has been observed in most kinase inhibitor co-crystal structures (Fig. 4). The remainder of the Gleevec molecule extends out of the Syk active site toward a solvent channel, and there is no clear electron density for the solubilizing piperazine group. The pyridine, pyrimidine, and benzene rings of Gleevec closely superimpose with all the three coplanar arms of staurosporine, forming comparable Van der Waals' interactions with the hydrophobic side chains that form the adenine pocket. As seen in other staurosporine co-crystal structures (29Zhu X. Kim J.L. Newcomb J.R. Rose P.E. Stover D.R. Toledo L.M. Zhao H. Morgenstern K.A. Struct.

Dnmt1 is targeted to replication foci, interacts with PCNA, and favors methylating the hemimethylated form of CpG sites. To understand the underlying mechanism of its maintenance function, we purified recombinant forms of full-length Dnmt1, a truncated form of Dnmt1-(291–1620) lacking the binding sites for PCNA and DNA and examined their processivity using a series of long unmethylated and hemimethylated DNA substrates. Direct analysis of methylation patterns using bisulfite-sequencing and hairpin-PCR techniques demonstrated that full-length Dnmt1 methylates hemimethylated DNA with high processivity and a fidelity of over 95%, but unmethylated DNA with much less processivity. The truncated form of Dnmt1 showed identical properties to full-length Dnmt1 indicating that the N-terminal 290-amino acid residue region of Dnmt1 is not required for preferential activity toward hemimethylated sites or for processivity of the enzyme. Remarkably, our analyses also revealed that Dnmt1 methylates hemimethylated CpG sites on one strand of double-stranded DNA during a single processive run. Our findings suggest that these inherent enzymatic properties of Dnmt1 play an essential role in the faithful and efficient maintenance of methylation patterns in the mammalian genome.

In mammals, position 5 of cytosine residues in CpG sequences in genomic DNA is usually methylated (1Ehrlich M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 2709-2721Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications that plays crucial roles in embryonic development, cell differentiation, and genomic imprinting through regulation of chromatin modification resulting in gene silencing (2Bird A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5448) Google Scholar).

In mouse, de novo-type DNA methylation activity creates gene-specific methylation patterns at the implantation stage of embryogenesis (4Okano M. Xie S. Li E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 219-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), and maintenance-type activity ensures clonal transmission of lineage-specific methylation patterns during replication. Two DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, are responsible for the creation of methylation patterns at an early stage of embryogenesis, while Dnmt1 is responsible for the maintenance of methylation patterns once formed (7Li E.

Interestingly, PCNA facilitates the hemimethylation activity of Dnmt1 (13Iida T. Suetake I. Tajima S. Morioka H. Ohta S. Obuse C. Tsurimoto T. Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is also reported that the N-terminal 1–343 sequence binds to DNA (14Fatemi M. Hermann A. Pradhan S. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1189-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), and the amino acid residues 284–287 of human DNMT1 play a crucial role in the allosteric effect on DNA methylation (15Pradhan S. Esteve P.O. Biochemistry. 2003; 13: 5321-5332Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have further restricted the DNA binding sequence to the N-terminal 1–290 amino acids. 2I. Suetake, unpublished observation. The N-terminal sequence 1–307 is reported to form a domain, and depletion of further sequence toward the C-terminal abolishes DNA methylation activity (16Margot J.B. Aguirre-Arteta A.M. Di Giacco B.V. Pradhan S. Roberts R.J. Cardoso M.C. Leonhardt H. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, Dnmt1 methylates the hemimethylated CpG sites that are generated at the replication fork. It is convenient for Dnmt1 to stay on the same DNA and methylate CpG sites in a processive manner. Further, it is possible that the binding of Dnmt1 to DNA and PCNA, which circles and slides on the DNA, with its N-terminal domain helps the DNA methylation activity to be processive. In the present study, we addressed whether or not the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1 is processive, and if so, whether interactions with the N-terminal DNA and PCNA binding regions are necessary for this property. We expressed and purified recombinant Dnmt1 (Dnmt1-FL) and its truncated form (Dnmt1-dN) that lacks the N-terminal 290 amino acid residues. Both recombinant Dnmt1-FL and Dnmt1-dN showed similar specific activities, specificity toward different types of DNA substrates including hemimethylated DNA, and processivity. The results indicate that Dnmt1 methylates hemimethylated DNA in a processive manner, and that this processivity is independent of interactions with DNA and PCNA in the N-terminal domain. In addition, Dnmt1 was shown to preferentially methylate one strand of the double-stranded DNA during its processive methylation. cDNA of full-length (Dnmt1-FL) and one that has deleted the 5′-sequence corresponding to the N-terminal 290 amino acid residues (Dnmt1-dN) of mouse Dnmt1 were subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the expression vector, pFASTBACHTb (Invitrogen). Recombinant baculoviruses were constructed according to the manufacturer's instructions, and amplified by three rounds of infection to obtain high titer baculovirus stock. Sf9 cells were maintained in Grace's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum at 27 °C. The recombinant baculovirus harboring His-tagged Dnmt1-FL or Dnmt1-dN was infected into 5 × 108 Sf9 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 2. Infected cells were incubated for 60 h and then harvested. All purification procedures were performed at 4 °C or on ice. Harvested cells were washed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer in a buffer comprising 10% (w/v) sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nikkol (Nikko Chemicals, Tokyo), 1/1,000 (v/v) protease inhibitor mixture (Nakalai Tesque, Kyoto), and 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.2; and then 5 m NaCl added to a final concentration of 0.25 m followed by a second homogenization. The mixture was then centrifuged at 250,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant fraction recovered. The extract was filtered through a 0.45-μm MILEX-HA filter (Millipore), and then loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Chelating Sepharose HP column (Amersham Biosciences), which was preloaded with Ni2+ and equilibrated with buffer A (0.25 m NaCl, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Nikkol, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mm PIPES, pH 6.2). The column was washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A and then with 2 column volumes of buffer A with 0.2 m imidazole, pH 6.2, added; and the proteins eluted with buffer A added with 1 m imidazole, pH 6.2. The main fractions were pooled, and the protease inhibitor mixture and dithiothreitol were added to final concentrations of 0.1% (v/v) and 1 mm, respectively. Aliquots were frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The purity of the enzymes was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentrations were determined by the method described by Bradford (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Poly(dIdC)-poly(dIdC), poly(dGdC)-poly(dGdC) (Amersham Biosciences), and a 520-bp DNA fragment (Fig. 2) from the p2HhaBsp plasmid (details available upon request) were used as substrates for determination of DNA methylation activity. The unmethylated form and three differently hemimethylated forms of the fragment were prepared as follows. (i) Unmethylated DNA (UM)—The 520-bp fragment was PCR-amplified with primers, 5′-ACTTCAATATATTGCTTATAACATTGGTTC-3′ and 5′-ATTTGCCCATGGTGAAAACGGGGGCGAAGA-3′ using p2HhaBsp as a template and then purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. (ii) DNA Hemimethylated at GCG Sites (GCG-HM)—Cytosine residues in the GCG sequences of the 520-bp sequence were methylated in vivo using an engineered variant of the HhaI methyltransferase, HH2Bsp. DNA methyltransferase is encoded in p2HhaBsp and specifically targets the GCG sites. 3G. Vilkaitis et al., manuscript in preparation. Induction of HH2Bsp expressed in Escherichia coli ER1727 with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside leads to the creation of G5mCG/CGC sites in the plasmid DNA. The hemimethylated 520-bp DNA fragment was excised with the SspI and RsaI restriction endonucleases and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. (iii) DNA Hemimethylated at All CpG Sites in One Strand (CG-HM)—The unmethylated 520-bp fragment was methylated with SssI DNA methyltransferase (M.SssI) and HaeIII DNA methyltransferase (M.HaeIII) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. M.HaeIII marks the GGCC site in the parent DNA, which allows discrimination between the parent and Dnmt1-methylated strands. The methylated fragment was annealed with an equal amount of unmethylated 520-bp fragment, and the fragments PCR-amplified for 12 cycles with the primers described above in (i) in the presence of dCTP. The amplified DNA was treated with HhaI to degrade unmethylated duplex, and the remaining hemimethylated 520-bp fragment was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. (iv) DNA Uniformly Hemimethylated at All the Cytosine Residues in One Strand (C-HM)—The p2HhaBsp plasmid was PCR-amplified with the same primers as in (i) in the presence of dm5CTP (Fermentas, Lithuania) instead of dCTP. The amplified 520-bp fragment was then mixed and re-annealed with an equal amount of unmethylated 520-bp fragment. As described above, the DNA was then PCR-amplified, digested with HhaI, and purified by agarose gel electrophoresis. DNA methylation activity was determined basically as described elsewhere (18Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In brief, the methylation reaction mixture contained 4 nm Dnmt1-FL, Dnmt1-dN, or 0.032 units/μl M.SssI, and indicated amounts of DNA and 5.3 μmS-[3H]adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) (15 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) in 25 μl of reaction buffer comprising 5% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. After 40 min of incubation for Dnmt1 and 15 min for M.SssI at 37 °C, radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. Methylation activities were calculated from 3–4 experiments and expressed as mean ± S.D. Unmethylated or hemimethylated 520-bp DNA fragments (50–100 nm) were incubated with 100 μm AdoMet and 25–100 nm Dnmt1 or 0.032 units/μl M.SssI in the reaction buffer for 0, 45, 90, and 180 min. Aliquots were taken from reaction mixture and the reaction terminated (18Suetake I. Miyazaki J. Murakami C. Takeshima H. Tajima S. J. Biochem. 2003; 133: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Carrier salmon sperm DNA (2 μg) was added, and samples treated with sodium bisulfite as described elsewhere (19Vilkaitis G. Klimasauskas S. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 271: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The modification reaction comprised eight cycles of incubation at 95 °C for 1 min and at 55 °C for 1 h. Modified DNA was recovered with Wizard DNA Clean-Up System (Promega), treated with 0.3 m NaOH at 37 °C for 20 min, ethanol-precipitated in the presence of 2.5 m ammonium acetate, and dissolved in 40 μl of 1× TE buffer. The modified DNA was PCR-amplified with appropriate strand-specific primer sets (Table I and Fig. 2). The amplification reaction comprised a cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, 5 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and then 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 48 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension was performed for another 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subcloned into the SmaI site of pUC19 or pBlueScript II. Sequences were determined by the dideoxy method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary J Jr C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoge R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Following DNA methylation with Dnmt1-dN and 100 μm AdoMet for 90 min, the DNA fragment was digested with AflIII, and then ligated with the hairpin linker 5′-CACGTGCGATGCGTTCGAGCATCGCA-3′ overnight at 16 °C. The ligated DNA was treated with 0.3 m NaOH at 42 °C for 20 min, at 95 °C for 1 min and then subjected to bisulfite modification as described above. The bisulfite-modified DNA was next PCR-amplified with the primer set VA2/AA4. The amplification reaction comprised a cycle of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, and then 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The amplified 654-bp fragments were gel-purified, cloned into the SmaI site of pUC19, and sequenced. Enzymatic Activities of Recombinant Dnmt1-FL and Dnmt1-dN—The full-length Dnmt1 (Dnmt1-FL) and the truncated form of Dnmt1 (Dnmt1-dN), devoid of the N-terminal 290 amino acid residues were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1A). The DNA methylation activities of Dnmt1-FL and Dnmt1-dN toward various substrates were first examined by monitoring incorporation of [3H]methyl groups into DNA. Using poly(dI-dC)-poly(dI-dC) as methyl acceptor, Dnmt1-FL and Dnmt1-dN showed apparent turnover rates of 13.5 ± 1.0 and 14.5 ± 0.9 (h-1), respectively. Previously reported turnover rates for recombinant mouse Dnmt1 expressed in baculovirus systems were 3.4 (22Glickman J.F. Flynn J. Reich N.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 280-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), 4.5 (23Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J.

Purif. 2002; 25: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), indicating that the activities of both preparations are comparable to those purified in other laboratories. As for hemimethylated DNA methylation activities, Pradhan et al. (23Pradhan S. Talbot D. Sha M. Benner J. Hornstra L. Li E. Jaenisch R. Roberts R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4666-4673Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) reported that mouse recombinant Dnmt1 does not show preferential methylation activity toward hemimethylated 30-mer DNA containing 3 CpG sites. In contrast, Brank et al. (24Brank A.S. Van Bemmel D.M. Christman J.K. Protein Expr. Purif. 2002; 25: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported that recombinant Dnmt1 methylates hemimethylated 24-mer DNA containing 4 CpG sites with a 6-fold higher activity than that toward unmethylated ones. Our present Dnmt1-FL, similar to the report by Brank et al., demonstrated 5.3-, 4.0-, and 2.9-fold higher activities toward three differently hemimethylated 520-bp DNA fragments, GCG-HM, CG-HM and C-HM, respectively, than that toward an unmethylated one (UM) (Fig. 1B). Similar to Dnmt1-FL, Dnmt1-dN also showed preferential methylation activities toward GCG-HM, CG-HM, and C-HM; 4.1-, 3.0-, and 2.4-fold higher, respectively, compared with that toward UM. Nearly identical behavior of the truncated enzyme with all the substrates, including preferred methylation of hemimethylated DNA, clearly indicates that the N-terminal region containing the binding sequences for DNA and PCNA is dispensable for the selectivity of Dnmt1 toward hemimethylated sites. Araujo et al. (25Araujo F.D. Croteau S. Slack A.D. Milutinovic S. Bigey P. Price G.B. Zannis-Hajopoulos M. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6930-6936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) reported that the targeting sequence for hemimethylated DNA resides in the N-terminal domain near the PCNA recognition site; however, our present results show that the N-terminal domain containing the PCNA site is dispensable for the preferential methylation of Dnmt1 toward hemimethylated DNA. Dnmt1 Methylates Unmethylated DNA Distributively—For the processivity studies of Dnmt1, we employed a 520-bp DNA fragment of the p2HhaBsp plasmid as the substrate (Fig. 2). The 520-bp sequence contains 30 CpG sites in different sequence contexts, with separation between adjacent sites varying from 1 to 30 nucleotides. Methyl group incorporation by enzymes was followed by bisulfite sequencing of both strands, which allowed direct visualization of their action on DNA. To be confident that our approach provides reliable results, we started with an analysis of a known processive DNA methyltransferase, M.SssI. Previous studies of M.SssI-methylated DNA with methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases revealed that multisite substrate DNA is converted to fully endonuclease-resistant products with very little intermediate observed during the course of the reaction (26Matsuo K. Silke J. Gramatikoff K. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5354-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 27Renbaum P. Razin A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 313: 243-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As expected, our bisulfite analysis directly demonstrated that M.SssI methylates the unmethylated substrate DNA (UM) in an all-or-nothing manner. Once methylation was initiated in one DNA strand, most of the CpG sites in the strand were almost completely methylated even at early stage of the methylation reaction, whereas a large fraction of DNA molecules remained completely untouched (compare Fig. 3, B and C, 45 and 180 min reactions). Therefore, our results clearly support the previous findings that M.SssI is a highly processive DNA methyltransferase, and thus provided a “positive control” for our analyses of Dnmt1. On the other hand, bisulfite sequencing of the unmethylated control displayed no single methylated cytosine in 35 sequences analyzed (Fig. 3A). Results of a similar analysis of Dnmt1-FL using UM is shown in Fig. 3D. The observed patterns were in great contrast to those of M.SssI. First, the methylation level was fairly low even after 3-h incubation, consistent with the much lower turnover rate of Dnmt1 on unmethylated DNA. Second, sparse 5mCpG sites appeared in a random rather than a consecutive manner, indicating a distributive action of Dnmt1 toward unmethylated DNA. Dnmt1 Methylates Hemimethylated DNA Processively—To examine the processivity of the DNA methylation activity of Dnmt1, three differently hemimethylated DNA fragments were prepared. First, we utilized an engineered version of the M.HhaI, HH2Bsp, which possesses relaxed sequence specificity and, in contrast to the wild-type enzyme (recognition specificity GCGC), methylates non-palindromic GCG sites with greater than 80–90% efficiency.3 The 520-bp sequence containing plasmid was methylated with HH2Bsp in vivo (Fig. 4A). Among the 30 target CpG sites in the 520-bp sequence, 20 appear in the GCG context (see Fig. 2), and 18 of these are converted into hemimethylated G5mCG/CGC sites by HH2Bsp treatment. A single palindromic GCGC site (no. 27, an equivalent of two symmetrical GCG sites on two strands) is methylated in both strands. The methylation state of 17 of these sites in the 520-bp fragment was determined by bisulfite sequencing. A total of 304 GCG sites in the upper and lower strands were examined in 32 clones and about 88% of the sites were found methylated on one strand (the upper strand at sites 6–9, 19, 22, 23, and 27, 28, and the lower strand at sites 10–14, 20, 21, 24, 26, 27, 29; see Fig. 2). The GCG-hemimethylated DNA (GCG-HM) was used to examine the behavior of Dnmt1-FL. After 45, 90, and 180 min methylation reactions, DNA methylation sites in the upper and lower strands were determined by bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 4B). Since the parent methylation is strictly strand-specific at each individual GCG site, it was thus possible to ascertain methylated cytosine residues that were catalyzed by Dnmt1. As typically demonstrated in the methylation profile after 90 min of reaction, once methylation occurred in a fragment, multiple CpG sites of the DNA fragment were methylated, mostly consecutively. Moreover, we performed experiments in which the ratio of DNA to Dnmt1 in the reaction mixture was varied from 1:2 (Fig. 4B) to 1:1, 1:0.5, and 1:0.25 (Fig. 4C). As expected, the relative numbers of completely unmethylated DNA clones increased when substrate DNA:enzyme ratios increased, and most of the methylated fragments contained consecutive stretches of methylated CpG sites. Similarly with Dnmt1-FL, Dnmt1-dN methylated hemimethylated CpG sites consecutively on each DNA fragment (Fig. 5). Despite slight differences in the extent of methylation due to variations of enzyme concentration in the preparations, the results indicate that Dnmt1-dN methylates DNA in a processive manner. One can thus conclude that the N-terminal domain (amino acid residues 1–290) is not required for the processivity of the enzyme. Strand Specificity during Processive Methylation of DNA—To understand its in vivo maintenance function, it is important to know whether Dnmt1 preferentially stays on the same DNA strand of the DNA duplex, or goes from one strand to another during its processive action on DNA. The methylation patterns shown in Figs. 4 and 5 provide information of the upper and lower strands of independent clones. To address the question whether or not Dnmt1 shows strand-specific methylation, the information that comes from both strands of the same DNA molecule is needed. For this, we employed the “hairpin-bisulfite PCR” method (21Laird C.D. Pleasant N.D. Clark A.D. Sneeden J.L. Hassan K.M. Manley N.C. Vary J Jr C. Morgan T. Hansen R.S. Stoge R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), which provides information of the methylation status on both strands of an individual DNA molecule in a single sequencing run. After methylation of GCG-HM with Dnmt1, both strands of the fragment were circularly connected by a hairpin linker and analyzed by bisulfite sequencing (Fig. 6A). Among such analysis of 65 independent clones, 28 were not methylated by Dnmt1 (only parent GCG sites were methylated, data not shown), 23 were methylated on one strand at hemimethylated CpG sites, and 14 were methylated on both strands (Fig. 6B). Sequences with a consecutive stretch of methylation in either strand, 20 clones (clones 15–23, 26–36), were the majority of cases. This result suggests that Dnmt1 stays on one, upper or lower, strand and preferentially methylates the strand in a processive manner. Typical examples are shown in Fig. 6B, sequence numbers 15–19. These sequences show that even when all or nearly all CpG sites in one strand were methylated, none in the other strand was methylated. This indicates that Dnmt1 did not switch to the opposite strand until its processive run on the original strand was completed. In some sequences, both strands were methylated either completely or partially (clones 1–14). Among the sequences that were almost completely methylated in both strands, some contained 5mCpG at sites that were originally not hemimethylated (indicated by small filled circles). Sites were sometimes fully methylated and sometimes hemimethylated (clones 1–5, 7, and 9–11). Since Dnmt1 shows high fidelity in methylating hemimethylated CpG sites (see discussion below), it is unlikely that Dnmt1 failed to methylate these newly produced hemimethylated CpG sites at such a high frequency. Accordingly, the strands containing unmethylated CpG at the hemimethylated site, which were created by Dnmt1 activity, should be processively methylated prior to the opposite strand. The occurrence of hemimethylated CpG sites that were originally unmethylated along with Dnmt1 methylation at hemimethylated sites on both strands suggests that such methylation patterns were created not in a single processive run, but as two or more sequential events. In contrast, three clones (12Chuang L.S.H. Ian H.I. Koh T.W. Ng H.H. Xu G. Li B.F.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1996-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar, 13Iida T. Suetake I. Tajima S.

Non-native disulfide bonds are often formed between incorrect cysteine residues, and thus the cell has dedicated a family of oxidoreductases that are thought to isomerize non-native bonds.

In 1963 Anfinsen showed that the folding of a protein, ribonuclease, is spontaneous and depends entirely on the primary structure of the protein (1Goldberger R.F. Epstein C.J. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 628-635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have since learnt that the formation of disulfide bonds is a rate-limiting step in protein folding and does not always result in the correct pairing of cysteine residues (2Jansens A. van Duijn E. Braakman I. Science. 2002; 298: 2401-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′maleimidylstilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; DPS, dipyridyl sulfide; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; BioGEE, biotinylated glutathione ester.1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; AMS, 4-acetamido-4′maleimidylstilbene-2, 2′-disulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; DPS, dipyridyl sulfide; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; BSO, buthionine sulfoximine; BioGEE, biotinylated glutathione ester. an entire family of oxidoreductases exist including protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI), ERp57, ERp72, P5, and PDI-related protein (PDIR), which is dedicated to forming native disulfide bonds.Members of the oxidoreductase family are characterized by a functional CXXC motif that shares structural homology with the small redox protein thioredoxin (3Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 4Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 331-336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar). The active site cysteine residues can exist in either an oxidized redox state where the cysteine residues are in the disulfide form or in a reduced redox state where the cysteine residues assume the dithiol form. This motif allows the oxidoreductases to catalyze three essential reactions depending on the initial redox state of the enzyme. A disulfide bond may be formed through the oxidation of a substrate protein requiring the oxidoreductase to gain two electrons, non-native disulfide bonds may be shuffled or isomerized with no net exchange of electrons, or incorrect pairings may be broken or reduced, requiring the oxidoreductase to donate two electrons to the substrate. Therefore, for an oxidoreductase to be capable of forming a disulfide bond, it must itself be oxidized to be capable of accepting electrons. Conversely, an oxidoreductase can only be functional as an isomerase or reductase when it is in a reduced form, to be capable of donating electrons. After each cycle of reduction or oxidation, the oxidoreductase must be returned back to its original, active redox state before it can fulfill further catalytic rounds. Thus, there is a requirement for oxidative and reductive pathways within the cell.The oxidative pathway for disulfide bond formation has been well characterized where PDI is known to oxidize substrate proteins and is itself maintained in an oxidized form by Ero1 (5Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 6Frand A.R. Kaiser C.A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 469-477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), for which the ultimate electron acceptor can be molecular oxygen (7Tu B.P. Weissman J.S. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 983-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, other oxidoreductases such as ERp57 are thought to act as reductases or isomerases and must therefore be maintained in a reduced state to remain active. A candidate for the reduction of the oxidoreductases is reduced GSH. However, the glutathione buffer in the ER is found at a GSH:GSSG ratio of between 1:1 and 3:1; far more oxidizing than that in the cytosol, where it is thought to be as high as 100:1 (8Hwang C. Sinskey A.J. Lodish H.F. Science. 1992; 257: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). In addition, it has recently been shown that up to 50% of the glutathione present in the ER is present as mixed disulfides with protein, which had previously gone undetected, demonstrating that glutathione in the ER is even more oxidizing than was formerly thought (9Bass R. Ruddock L.W. Klappa P. Freedman R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 5257-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Before the discovery that Ero1 oxidizes PDI, GSSG was commonly thought to provide oxidizing equivalents for the formation of disulfide bonds. However, it has been demonstrated that protein folding in yeast is more readily compromised by the addition of an oxidant when glutathione synthesis is compromised, suggesting that GSH could still play a role in the reductive pathway (10Cuozzo J.W. Kaiser C.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar).In comparison, specific enzymes have also been discovered that maintain the active redox state of the bacterial oxidoreductases. DsbA oxidizes substrate proteins and is maintained in an oxidized state by DsbB (11Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). This parallels the way in which PDI oxidizes substrate proteins in eukaryotic cells and is itself oxidized by Ero1. These systems are strikingly similar; dsbA mutants are complimented by the addition of human PDI into the bacterial periplasm (11Bardwell J.C. Lee J.O. Jander G. Martin N. Belin D. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1038-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 12Humphreys D.P. Weir N. Mountain A. Lund P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28210-28215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The bacterial pathway for the reduction of disulfide bonds is kinetically separate from the oxidation pathway and consists of DsbC and DsbG, which isomerize and reduce substrate proteins and are maintained in a reduced state by DsbD (13Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). DsbD functions by transferring electrons from cytoplasmic thioredoxin to DsbC and DsbG (13Stewart E.J. Katzen F. Beckwith J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5963-5971Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 14Bessette P.H. Cotto J.J. Gilbert H.F. Georgiou G. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5075-5089Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This is the sole function of DsbD and given the similarities between the prokaryotic and eukaryotic oxidative pathways, it has often been speculated that pathways parallel to the prokaryotic reductive pathway may also exist in eukaryotic cells.To uncover a reductive pathway in eukaryotic cells we first examined the redox state of a number of oxidoreductases in vivo by modification of free cysteines with the alkylating agent AMS. We show that most of the oxidoreductases exist in a predominantly reduced form in vivo, suggesting that they might act as isomerases or reductases. Following oxidative stress, we demonstrate that a model protein, ERp57, is quickly reduced, demonstrating that a pathway is in place to maintain the oxidoreductases in a reduced state. However, following oxidation, ERp57 is not reduced in microsomes unless cytosol is present. We show that the cytosolic component capable of reducing ERp57 is GSH, which in turn is reduced by cytosolic glutathione reductase. Inhibition of either glutathione reductase of glutathione synthesis prevents the reduction of ERp57 following oxidation. In addition, following oxidative stress glutathione is reduced by the cell in a time scale compatible with that of ERp57. We also demonstrate that glutathione rapidly reduces ERp57 at physiological concentrations in vitro, and biotinylated glutathione forms a mixed disulfide with ERp57 in microsomes. These findings define a clear role for glutathione in the reductive pathway for the formation of native disulfide bonds, a role that exceeds that of a buffer against hyperoxidation.MATERIALS AND METHODSAntibodies—Antibodies used in this study were raised as described previously (PDI) (16John D.C. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), or were raised in rabbits to the following peptides: DIDLSDVELDDLGKDEL (P5), IQEEKPKKKKKAQEDL (ERp57), TNY-IRALREGDHERLGKK (PDIR), and KFIEEHATKLSRTKEEL (ERp72).Determination of Redox State in Vivo—HT1080 cells (a human fibrosarcoma cell line) in suspension were either left untreated or treated with 10 mm DTT or 1 mm DPS. The redox state of proteins was determined using AMS to alkylate free thiols. The redox state in vivo was trapped by alkylation of free thiols with 25 mmN-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (lysis buffer). The lysate was denatured by boiling for 2 min in the presence of 1% (w/v) SDS. Tris[2-carboxyethyl]phosphine (TCEP) was added (10 mm) to break existing disulfide bonds, which were then alkylated by the addition of 30 mm AMS (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands) for 1 h at room temperature. The lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted to detect various oxidoreductases; oxidized proteins displayed a decrease in mobility.The reduction of ERp57 was examined following oxidation of HT1080 cells with 0.5 mm DPS. Prior to the experiment the cells were either left untreated or treated with 0.5 mm BSO overnight or 0.1 mm carmustine for 3 h. Samples were retained to show the redox state of ERp57 before oxidation. The cells were incubated with 0.5 mm DPS for 5 min at room temperature. DPS was removed by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in fresh buffer containing the appropriate inhibitors at the afore mentioned concentrations. At various time points the redox state was trapped by the addition of 25 mm NEM, and the redox state was determined as above.Reduction of ERp57 in Microsomes—Cytosol was prepared following homogenization of 3 × 108 HT1080 cells in 4 volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA (Buffer A). The cell homogenates were centrifuged at 150,000 × g to pellet membranes. Recovered cytosol was separated on a PD10 column previously equilibrated with buffer A and eluted in the same buffer. The fractions were monitored for protein concentration (17Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar) and glutathione concentration (see later) and pooled accordingly.Microsomes prepared from HT1080 cells (18Middleton R.B. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were either left untreated or treated with 0.5 mm DPS for 5 min. DPS was removed by centrifugation, and oxidized microsomes were incubated in either buffer A or isolated cytosol. At various times, the redox state was determined through modification with AMS as described above.Glutathione Assay—Total glutathione concentration was measured essentially as described previously (19Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (5504) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 8 mm HCl, 1.3% (w/v) 5-sulfosalicylic acid on ice for 1 h. The proteins were removed by centrifugation. The acidified sample was added to 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.6 mm Ellman's reagent, glutathione reductase (1–2 units/ml), 150 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The rate of change of absorption at 405 nm was measured over 1 min with respect to GSH standards. To measure oxidized glutathione concentration acidified samples were treated with 0.3% (v/v) 4-vinylpyridine and 5 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.8, for 1 h at 20 °C. The samples were assayed as above with respect to GSSG standards. GSH concentrations were calculated by subtracting the concentration of GSSG from the total glutathione concentration.Determination of Redox State in Vitro—Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS containing a modified version of pET23b expressing His-tagged ERp57 was a kind gift from Professor S. High (University of Manchester, Manchester, UK). His-tagged ERp57 was purified and dialyzed against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (20Russell S.J. Ruddock L.W. Salo K.E. Oliver J.D. Roebuck Q.P.

The redox state of ERp57 in vitro was determined by alkylation with AMS. Disulfide exchange was prevented, and the proteins were precipitated by the addition of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 25% (v/v) acetone for 1 h on ice. After centrifugation the pellets were washed twice with cold acetone and resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.8 containing 4% (v/v) glycerol and 1% (w/v) SDS). Free thiols were alkylated with 30 mm AMS for 1 h at room temperature, and the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue; reduced protein displayed a decrease in mobility.Association of ERp57 with Biotinylated Glutathione—Microsomes from HT1080 cells were treated with 0.5 mm DPS for 5 min and allowed to recover for 1 h in fresh buffer A in the presence of BioGEE (2.5 mm). After 7.5 min free thiols were alkylated by the addition of 25 mm NEM and lysed in lysis buffer. The lysates were precleared for 30 min at 4 °C by incubation with 2.5% (v/v) suspension of streptavidin-agarose that had previously been blocked with 100× binding capacity of biotin (10 μm) and then washed eight times with lysis buffer. The beads were removed, and the supernatant was incubated with 2.5% (v/v) streptavidin-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with lysis buffer four times and then resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT (50 mm) and boiled for 2 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for ERp57.RESULTSERp57 Is Maintained in a Reduced State in Vivo—To assess the requirement for a reductive pathway, we first examined the redox state of several ER oxidoreductases within mammalian cells grown in culture. To evaluate the redox state under physiological conditions, we treated intact cells with the membrane permeable alkylating agent NEM to prevent disulfide exchange and freeze redox status. We then treated cell lysates with a second larger alkylating agent (AMS) that caused a shift in mobility when the protein is separated by SDS-PAGE. NEM alkylation prevented AMS modification of free thiols that were present when the proteins were in the intact cells. The second alkylation step was carried out in the presence of a reducing agent; therefore, proteins that contained disulfide bonds when present in intact cells showed a decreased electrophoretic mobility. When the redox state of the known ER oxidoreductases ERp57, ERp72, P5, PDI-related protein, and PDI was assessed using this approach, a clear decrease in mobility was seen for the proteins from intact cells treated with the oxidizing agent DPS in comparison with cells treated with the reducing agent DTT (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). When no reducing or oxidizing agent was added to cells, most of the oxidoreductases migrated with the mobility of the reduced protein (Fig. 1A, lane 3), demonstrating that they are predominantly reduced at steady state. The exception was PDI, which ran as a diffuse band, suggesting partial oxidation. These results are consistent with those published previously for ERp57 and PDI in mammalian cells (21Mezghrani A. Fassio A. Benham A. Simmen T. Braakman I. Sitia R. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6288-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) and emphasize that although the ER lumen is optimized for the formation of disulfide bonds in secretory proteins, the active site of these particular enzymes are either partially or completely reduced. Such a reduced state would be required if these proteins are involved in disulfide bond reduction of isomerization. The presence of a reductive pathway should enable the ER oxidoreductases to recover from the addition of oxidizing agent to re-establish free thiols. To determine whether this can occur, we treated cells with DPS and then evaluated the redox state of ERp57 at various time points after removal of the oxidizing agent. As can be seen (Fig. 1B), ERp57 was partially reduced after 5 min and was completely reduced 15 min following removal of the oxidizing agent. Similar results were obtained for the other oxidoreductases (data not shown), thus establishing that in intact cells a robust reductive pathway exists to maintain these proteins in a reduced state.Glutathione Is Required for the Reduction of ERp57—To further characterize the reductive pathway, we fractionated cells to determine whether the reductive pathway could function in isolated microsomal vesicles. The ERp57 in isolated microsomes was shown to be reduced and could be oxidized by the addition of DPS (Fig. 2A, upper panel, lanes 1 and 2). However, when the microsomes were isolated and resuspended in buffer in the absence of oxidizing agent, no reduction of ERp57 was observed (Fig. 2A, upper panel). Hence all of the factors required for the reductive pathway are not present in isolated microsomal vesicles. To determine whether we could reconstitute the reductive pathway in microsomal vesicles, we repeated the experiment but this time resuspended the oxidized microsomes in isolated cytosol. Under these conditions reduction of ERp57 occurred but with slightly slower kinetics than in intact cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel). The delay is probably due to the fact that the isolated cytosol is diluted by ∼5-fold during preparation. It is clear from these results that factor(s) from the cytosol are required for efficient reduction of ERp57.Fig. 2Glutathione is the cytosolic component required for reduction of ERp57 following oxidative stress. The redox state was determined by alkylation with AMS, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with an antibody to ERp57. A, microsomes prepared from HT1080 cells were either left untreated (lane 1) or oxidized with DPS (0.5 mm) for 5 min (lanes 2–7). DPS was removed, and oxidized microsomes were incubated in either Buffer A (top panel) or isolated cytosol (lower panel). At various times the redox state was determined. B, microsomes were oxidized with as in A and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of either cytosol (lane 1), cytosol depleted of low molecular mass (MW) components (lane 2), or the fractionated low molecular mass components (lane 3). The redox state of ERp57 was determined after 1 has described. C, microsomes were oxidized as in A and incubated at 37 °C in buffer A containing various low molecular mass compounds at the concentrations indicated. The redox state of ERp57 was determined after 1 h. D, microsomes were oxidized as in A and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in buffer A containing depleted cytosol and/or NADPH (1 mm) and/or GSSG (0.5 mm) as indicated. Carmustine (BCNU) (0.1 mm) or cisplatin (0.1 mm) were also included in addition to depleted cytosol, NADPH and GSSG (lanes 8 and 9, respectively). The samples were assayed for redox state as above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide information regarding the size of the component facilitating reduction, we fractionated the cytosol by size exclusion chromatography to deplete low molecular mass components (>5000 Da). Depleted cytosol was unable to bring about reduction of microsomal ERp57; however, the low molecular mass fraction was able to partially reduce ERp57 (Fig. 2B). That only partial reduction occurred is likely due to dilution of the active component during fractionation. Components within the cytosol that could contribute to reduction of ER oxidoreductases include low molecular mass molecules such as GSH, NADH, NADPH, cysteine, and cysteamine or proteins such as thioredoxin and glutaredoxin. To identify the component present within the low molecular mass fraction responsible for this reduction, we screened a number of reducing components that are present within cytosol for their ability to reduce ERp57 in the absence of added cytosol and at physiological concentrations (22Schafer F.Q. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 1191-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (3586) Google Scholar, 23Uppal A. Gupta P.K. Biotechnol. Appl.

Of all of the compounds tested, only GSH was able to reduce oxidized ERp57 (Fig. 2C). GSH is maintained in a reduced state within the cytosol by the enzyme glutathione reductase with reducing equivalents coming from NADPH. We therefore tested whether the addition of GSSG with and without NADPH to our depleted cytosol could also bring about the reduction of microsomal ERp57. Only a combination of cytosolic proteins, GSSG, and NADPH was able to efficiently reduce ERp57 (Fig. 2D, lane 7), suggesting that GSH is the active component in the cytosol required for reduction of microsomal ERp57. The recovery of reduced ERp57 was abolished when an inhibitor of glutathione reductase (carmustine) (26Becker K. Schirmer R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 251: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) was added to the cytosol (Fig. 2D, lane 8), demonstrating that the reduction of GSSG to GSH is required for reconstitution of the reductive pathway. In addition no inhibition of recovery was observed when an inhibitor of thioredoxin reductase (cisplatin) (27Arner E.S. Nakamura H. Sasada T. Yodoi J. Holmgren A. Spyrou G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1170-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) was added to the cytosol (Fig. 2D, lane 9), suggesting that thioredoxin is not involved in the ER reductive pathway.Glutathione Reduces ERp57 in Vivo—Having established that GSH can reduce ERp57 using our microsomal assay, we wanted to determine whether GSH was also involved in the reductive pathway within intact cells. To do this we either depleted the intracellular pool of GSH by inhibiting the initial enzyme in GSH synthesis (γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase) with BSO (28Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or we inhibited glutathione reductase with carmustine, thereby preventing reduction of GSSG following DPS oxidation. The normal intracellular concentration of GSH is ∼10 mm; this was reduced to ∼2 mm when the cells were incubated with BSO. Although this level of GSH was enough to maintain ERp57 in a reduced form at steady state, the effect of this decreased pool of GSH on the recovery of ERp57 from oxidation was dramatic. No recovery of reduced protein was seen even after 60 min of incubation following removal of oxidizing agent (Fig. 3B, upper panel). The addition of carmustine to the cells following the removal of oxidizing agent abolished the “recovery” of GSH from GSSG (Fig. 3A). The inhibition of GSH recovery also prevented any reduction of ERp57 following removal of oxidizing agent (Fig. 3B, lower panel), clearly demonstrating that for ERp57 to remain in a reduced state requires the presence of intracellular GSH. In addition the time course of recovery of the intracellular pool of GSH following treatment with DPS (Fig. 3A) correlates with the reduction of ERp57 (Fig. 1B). Taken together these results demonstrate that the levels of intracellular GSH either directly or indirectly influence the reductive pathway within the ER.Fig. 3Inhibition of reduction of glutathione in vivo prevents the reduction of ERp57 following oxidative stress. A, HT1080 cells were either left untreated (diamonds) or treated with BSO (0.5 mm) for 16 h (squares) or carmustine (0.1 mm) for 3 h (triangles). The cells were then oxidized for 5 min with DPS (0.5 mm). The oxidizing agent was removed, and the cells were allowed to recover in fresh medium. Treatment with BSO or carmustine was continued throughout the experiment at the concentrations stated above. At various intervals the level of GSH was determined using Ellman's reagent. B, HT1080 cells were treated with BSO (0.5 mm) overnight (upper panel) or carmustine (BCNU, 0.1 mm) for 3 h (lower panel). The cells were then untreated (lane 1) or oxidized and incubated in medium containing the same concentration of inhibitors as before oxidation (lanes 2–7). At various time points the redox state of ERp57 was determined through alkylation with AMS, SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting with an antibody to ERp57.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Glutathione Directly Reduces ERp57—To determine whether GSH is able to directly reduce ERp57, we first assessed whether the reduction of ERp57 in microsomes was dependent on the concentration of added GSH. Increasing the added GSH concentration from 1 to 10 mm rapidly increased the rate of reduction of ERp57 (Fig. 4A), consistent with a direct role for GSH in reducing ERp57. We then assessed whether GSH could reduce purified recombinant ERp57. For this experiment we first oxidized the protein with DPS and then removed the excess DPS by gel filtration and followed the reduction of oxidized protein either in the absence or presence of 10 mm GSH (Fig. 4B). Disulfide status was determined at individual time points by first quenching disulfide exchange by acidification followed by treatment with AMS. Hence using this approach a decrease in electrophoretic mobility indicates reduction of disulfide bonds. In the absence of GSH no reduction of purified protein was observed (Fig. 4B, upper panel). However, in the presence of GSH rapid reduction occurred with reduced protein being observed after 6 s and full reduction occurring after 5 min (Fig. 4B, lower panel). The reduced protein migrated as a smear rather than a tight band even when the protein was reduced by DTT (Fig. 4B, lane 1), a likely consequence of the acidification process. Despite this anomaly, it is clear from these results that ERp57 can be directly reduced by GSH and that the kinetics of reduction was equivalent to or even faster than the reduction of ERp57 in cells.Fig. 4Glutathione forms a mixed disulfide with and directly reduces ERp57. A, microsomes were untreated (lane 1) or oxidized then incubated in GSH (1 mm or 10 mm) (lanes 2–7). The redox state of ERp57 was determined at various times. B, purif"

This regulation requires myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) phosphorylation mediated by MLC kinase (MLCK). We examined the spatiotemporal segregation of MLCK isoform function and expression along the crypt-villus axis and found that long MLCK, which is expressed as two alternatively spliced isoforms, accounts for 97 ± 4% of MLC kinase activity in interphase intestinal epithelial cells. Expression of the MLCK1 isoform is limited to well differentiated enterocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, and this expression correlates closely with development of Na+-nutrient cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation. Consistent with this role, MLCK1 is localized to the perijunctional actomyosin ring. Furthermore, specific knockdown of MLCK1 using siRNA reduced tight junction permeability in monolayers with active Na+-glucose cotransport, confirming a functional role for MLCK1. These results demonstrate unique physiologically relevant patterns of expression and subcellular localization for long MLCK isoforms and show that MLCK1 is the isoform responsible for tight junction regulation in absorptive enterocytes.

The intestinal epithelial barrier, composed of the cell membranes and tight junctions that seal the paracellular space between adjacent cells, is critical for protecting the interstitium from the harsh luminal environment. However, this barrier is not static; its permeability characteristics change over the course of minutes, in response to luminal Na+ and glucose (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D.

Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The crypt-villus axis exhibits a large gradient in tight junction permeability; the secretory crypt area contains large pores (50–60Å), whereas the absorbing tip of the villus contains small pores (<5 Å) (4Fihn B.M. Sjoqvist A. Jodal M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These small pores at the villus tip also exhibit added functionality, because they are able to increase in number and thus increase the permeability of the epithelial barrier in response to Na+ and glucose (4Fihn B.M.

This acute regulation of paracellular permeability at the villus tip in response to Na+ and glucose is controlled by activation of the Na+-glucose cotransporter SGLT1, triggering a signaling pathway that leads to myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) 1The abbreviations used are: MLC, myosin II regulatory light chain; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; TER, transepithelial resistance; PIK, membrane permeant inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase; RT, reverse transcriptase; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid. phosphorylation, contraction of the perijunctional actomyosin ring, and increased tight junction permeability (1Turner J.R.

Rev. 2000; 41: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Numerous kinases are known to phosphorylate MLC and thus have the potential to regulate this process, including myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (8Adelstein R.S. Cell. 1982; 30: 349-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rho kinase (9Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol.

Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1745-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Of these kinases, only specific inhibition of MLCK has been shown to block SGLT1-mediated tight junction regulation (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D. Kerner R. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1378-C1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zolotarevsky Y. Hecht G. Koutsouris A. Gonzalez D.E. Quan C. Tom J. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The MLCK gene expressed in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells gives rise to multiple mRNA species, using three different transcriptional promoters as well as alternative splicing. In smooth muscle, the 130-kDa smooth muscle MLCK (short MLCK) and a carboxyl-terminal fragment of MLCK, telokin, are produced as separate mRNA transcripts. In contrast, a 220-kDa MLCK (long MLCK) containing a 922-amino acid amino-terminal extension is expressed in many nonmuscle cells, including embryonic tissues and endothelium (13Birukov K.G. Schavocky J.P. Shirinsky V.P. Chibalina M.V. Van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 70: 402-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 14Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Long MLCK is expressed as at least five different splice variants that all contain the amino-terminal extension; these variants are distinguished by the presence or absence of short (<70 amino acids) regions as a result of alternative mRNA splicing (15Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Long MLCK isoform 2, or MLCK2, is the predominant isoform expressed and differs from the full-length long MLCK isoform, MLCK1, by the absence of a 207-base pair sequence from nucleotides 1428–1634 (15Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The corresponding 69-amino acid region contains Src kinase phosphorylation sites and a potential SH2-binding domain (15Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In vitro enzymatic assays have shown that phosphorylation by Src kinase increases the Vmax of MLCK1, whereas the activity of unphosphorylated MLCK1 is similar to MLCK2 (16Birukov K.G. Csortos C. Marzilli L. Dudek S. Ma S.F. Bresnick A.R. Verin A.D. Cotter R.J. Garcia J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8567-8573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Despite the functional specialization of MLCK1, there have been no reports of differential subcellular or tissue distributions of long MLCK isoforms 1 and 2 that may explain the functional significance, at the cellular level, of the biochemical differences between these splice variants. Moreover, no studies have examined MLCK isoforms in intestinal epithelium, where there is spatial segregation of MLCK-dependent processes such as Na+-nutrient cotransport-dependent barrier regulation. Analysis of MLCK isoforms in differentiating human intestinal epithelium using laser capture microdissection and immunofluorescence microscopy with MLCK isoform-specific antisera as well as in vitro functional analyses have allowed us to document spatiotemporal regulation of MLCK isoform expression. The data show that long MLCK represents the principal myosin light chain kinase of intestinal enterocytes and is responsible for Na+-nutrient cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation. Within the intestinal epithelium, only MLCK1 and MLCK2 isoforms are expressed, and MLCK1 expression is limited to villus enterocytes, where it is concentrated within the perijunctional actomyosin ring. MLCK1 expression correlates with the development of the ability to increase tight junction permeability in response to Na+-glucose cotransport, and selective knockdown of MLCK1 decreases tight junction permeability. These data demonstrate a unique function and localization for a single splice variant of MLCK within the intestinal epithelium, implying that the short sequences unique to individual MLCK splice variants confer these distinct functional and spatial properties. Cell Culture—Caco-2 BBe cells (17Peterson M.D. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 581-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expressing the intestinal Na+-glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (18Turner J.R. Lencer W.I. Carlson S. Madara J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7738-7744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) were plated on Transwell semipermeable supports (Corning-Costar, Acton, MA) as described previously (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D. Kerner R. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1378-C1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For RT-PCR, monolayers were scraped into TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was extracted with chloroform, precipitated with isopropanol, and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Electrophysiology—Electrophysiological measurements were made with agar bridges and Ag-AgCl calomel electrodes as previously described (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D. Kerner R. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1378-C1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers were transferred from culture medium to Hank's balanced salt solution with 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. The media also contained either 25 mm glucose to activate Na+-glucose cotransport or 5 mm glucose, 20 mm mannose, and 2 mm phloridzin to inhibit Na+-glucose cotransport. For inhibitor experiments, either 250 μm PIK (12Zolotarevsky Y. Hecht G. Koutsouris A. Gonzalez D.E. Quan C. Tom J. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), 10 μm Y27632 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA), or 50 nm calyculin A (Calbiochem) was also included. Potential differences were measured before and after application of a 50-μA current, and the transepithelial resistance (TER) was determined using Ohm's law. TER values are reported 2 h after activation or inhibition of Na+-glucose cotransport, at which point TER had reached the new steady state value as a function of Na+-glucose cotransport activity (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D. Kerner R. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1378-C1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase Immunodepletion Assay—Lysates (in 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Igepal CA630, and 0.5% Triton X-100) of confluent Caco-2 cells were immunoprecipitated with K36 monoclonal anti-MLCK antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and protein G Plus/protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem). Immunoblot analyses showed that this depleted the lysate of the 215-kDa long MLCK. The immunodepleted lysate and control lysates (immunoprecipitated using an irrelevant antibody) were used for in vitro kinase assays as previously described (12Zolotarevsky Y. Hecht G. Koutsouris A. Gonzalez D.E. Quan C. Tom J. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R. Gastroenterology. 2002; 123: 163-172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Briefly, the lysates were incubated with 0.2 μm calmodulin, 5 μM recombinant human intestinal epithelial MLC, and [γ-32P]ATP for 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and MLC phosphorylation was determined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. RT-PCR Sequencing of Long MLCK—cDNA was generated from 1 μg of Caco-2 cell RNA using Thermoscript reverse transcriptase and random hexamer primers in a 25-μl reaction (Invitrogen). 1 μl of this reaction was used for PCR amplification of long MLCK using primers 1–10 to allow for analysis of splice variants (see Fig. 2). Primer pairs 1 + 2 (CAACAAACAACAGAGAAGACGG + AGTCTTCTGAAGGACCGGG), 3 + 4 (TCTGAGAAGAACGGCATG + ACTTCAGGGGGTGGATTC), 5 + 6 (CCTCCTTCTCCAGTGTCC + TGGGAGTCCCCTTCTTGG), and 7 + 8 (GAGTTGGTGCTGATGGTGG + ATGAGGAGCCATACCAGG) used a 57 °C annealing temperature; primer pair 9 + 10 (CAGCAGGCAGGCCCAGGTCAAC + CTTAGAAACTGCTTTTCTCTGGC) used a 66 °C annealing temperature. The full-length long MLCK was amplified using primers 1 and 10 and a 60 °C annealing temperature. All of the reactions were cycled 36 times in a Bio-Rad iCycler thermal cycler (Bio-Rad). The PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and visualized using ethidium bromide. Bands of appropriate size were excised and purified by gel extraction (Qiagen). The bands were sequenced by the University of Chicago DNA Sequencing Facility using primers 1–10. Long MLCK from normal human intestine was amplified from a human intestinal epithelial cDNA library generated by cloning poly(dT) primed cDNA into the HybriZAP bacteriophage vector followed by amplification and in vivo mass excision to generate a two-hybrid library in pAD-GAL4 (19Scott R.O. Thelin W.R. Milgram S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22934-22941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Amplification used primers sets 1 + 2, 3 + 4, 5 + 6, 7 + 8, and 9 + 10 as described above. Primers 4–6 were used for sequencing to generate a 1-kb section of long MLCK sequence, which was used for BLAST searches. Laser Capture Microdissection—Surgically excised portions of normal human jejunum were embedded in optimal cutting temperature media and snap frozen within minutes of resection. The protocol for use of human tissues was approved by the Institutional Review Board of The University of Chicago. Frozen sections of normal human jejunum (10 μm) were cut on membrane-based laser microdissection slides (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and jejunal epithelial cells from villus tip, mid-villus, and crypt were collected using an ASLMD laser microdissection system (Leica). mRNA was isolated from the samples using a Quick-Prep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). RT-PCR Quantitation of mRNA Levels—Quantitation of MLCK1 and MLCK2 mRNA levels from Caco-2 cells was performed using primers 3 and 4 as described above. cDNA obtained from laser microdissection was used for the amplification of MLCK1, MLCK2, BRK, and keratin 8. Preliminary assays showed that 40 cycles of amplification was within the linear range of amplification for each of the primer sets under the conditions used. MLCK2 was amplified with primers 3 and 4 using an annealing temperature of 66 °C. MLCK1 was amplified with primers ACCCCCGTGAGGAGACAG and ACTTCAGGGGGTGGATTC and an annealing temperature of 58 °C. BRK was amplified with primers ATCCAGGCCATGAGAAGC and TGGATGTAATTCTGCGACTCC and an annealing temperature of 62.5 °C. Keratin 8 was amplified with primers TTGCCTCCTTCATAGACAAGG and TGTTGTCCATGTTGCTTCG and an annealing temperature of 62.5 °C. All of the reactions were separated on a 1% agarose gel and photographed with a FluorChem 8800 (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA), and band intensity was measured with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). MLCK1 Antibody Production—An 18-mer peptide (KARTRDSGTYSCTASNAQ) corresponding to residues within the 69-amino acid sequence that is unique to human MLCK1 was synthesized by the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center Peptide Facility. BLAST searches confirmed that this sequence was not expressed in other known or predicted sequences in the human genome. To avoid generating phosphospecific antiserum, described phosphorylation sites at Tyr464 and Tyr471 (16Birukov K.G. Csortos C. Marzilli L. Dudek S. Ma S.F. Bresnick A.R. Verin A.D. Cotter R.J.

The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) using glutaraldehyde. Rabbits were primed with the peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted with the same peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant at 3-week intervals (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). A peptide-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed on test bleed serum to determine the specific antibody titers. The anti-peptide antiserum was purified through an affinity gel (Affi-Gel 10; Bio-Rad) coupled with the same peptide, and the antibodies bound specifically to the peptides were eluted with 3 m KSCN and dialyzed exhaustively against phosphate-buffered saline. Immunoblotting—Human endothelial cell MLCK1 and MLCK2 were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) as described previously (16Birukov K.G. Csortos C. Marzilli L.

For large scale expression and purification, Sf9 cells were infected with baculovirus (multiplicity of infection = 1), and the cells producing human endothelial MLCK1 and MLCK2 were harvested. The recombinant long MLCK1 or MLCK2 proteins, 0.5 μg each, or Caco-2 extracts, 10 μg, were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Duplicate blots were probed with affinity-purified anti-MLCK1-specific rabbit antibody (10 μg/ml) or K36 pan-MLCK monoclonal antibody (10 μg/ml). These were detected with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antisera (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and the blot was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence as described previously (1Turner J.R.

Immunofluorescent Microscopy—Immunostaining was performed as previously described (20Berglund J.J. Riegler M. Zolotarevsky Y. Wenzl E. Turner J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: G1487-G1493Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5-μm frozen sections were collected on coated slides, fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, and washed thrice with phosphate-buffered saline. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 5% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. After incubation with affinity-purified anti-MLCK1-specific rabbit antibody (10 μg/ml), affinity-purified anti-phosphorylated MLC specific rabbit antibody (10 μg/ml) (20Berglund J.J. Riegler M.

Sections were imaged using a Leica DMLB epifluorescence microscope equipped with an 88000 filter set (Chroma Technology, Brattleboro, VT), and a Cool-snap HQ camera (Roper Scientific, Tucson, AZ) controlled by Meta-Morph 6 (Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). RNAi—The 207-base pair sequence from nucleotides 1428–1634 unique to MLCK1 was used to design the MLCK1 siRNA SMARTpool (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). For transfection, 10 μl of 50 μm SMART-pool or 25 μl of 20 μm nonspecific siRNA mix was added to 500 μl of Optimem (Invitrogen) and allowed to incubate for 5 min at 25 °C. The siRNA solution was then added to 500 μl of Optimem containing 30 μl of siLentFect reagent (Bio-Rad) and allowed to incubate for 30 min at 25 °C to create the transfection mix. At the same time, ∼107 Caco-2 BBe cells were trypsinized with 1.5 ml of trypsin for 20 min. After trypsinization was complete, the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g glucose/liter (Mediatech, Herndon, VA). The cells were recovered by gentle centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), washed once more in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium followed by OptiMEM (Invitrogen), separated into two equal aliquots, and resuspended in 800 μl of OptiMEM. This was added to 1 ml of previously prepared transfection mix. The cell suspension/siRNA mix was then plated at high density on Transwell semipermeable supports (Corning-Costar) at 375,000 cells/cm2 and cultured for 4 days to allow for tight junction assembly and polarization before use in electrophysiology experiments. Na+-Glucose Cotransport-dependent Barrier Regulation Is Differentiation-dependent—Na+-nutrient cotransport-dependent regulation of tight junction permeability is a characteristic of small intestinal epithelium that is restricted to terminally differentiated absorptive villus enterocytes (4Fihn B.M. Sjoqvist A. Jodal M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 1029-1036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We have developed an in vitro model of this regulation in an intestinal Na+-glucose cotransporter-expressing clone of the adenocarcinoma-derived Caco-2 cell line. Like other Caco-2-derived cell lines, these cells acquire features of differentiated villus enterocytes during culture after confluence in a manner that recapitulates crypt to villus enterocyte differentiation (21Pinto M. Robine-Leon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Simon-Assmann P. Haffen K. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1983; 47: 323-330Google Scholar, 22Rousset M. Biochimie (Paris). 1986; 68: 1035-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). We noted that Na+-glucose cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation did not occur in relatively undifferentiated monolayers, despite the presence of intact tight junctions. We thus assessed the development of Na+-glucose cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation during Caco-2 differentiation (Fig. 1). We measured TER, a sensitive marker that is inversely related to tight junction permeability. In undifferentiated monolayers, <4 days post-confluence, TER was not significantly different with active or inactive Na+-glucose cotransport (p = 0.79). In contrast, Na+-glucose cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation was observed in more differentiated monolayers ≥6 days post-confluence; the average TER with active Na+-glucose cotransport was ∼40% less than with inhibited Na+-glucose cotransport (p = 0.002). Thus, the ability of intestinal epithelial monolayers to increase tight junction permeability in response to Na+-glucose cotransport is differentiation-dependent, suggesting that factor(s) responsible for this tight junction regulation are expressed or activated during enterocyte differentiation. MLCK Is Necessary for Na+-Glucose Cotransport-dependent Tight Junction Regulation—Na+-glucose cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation requires MLC phosphorylation, which is enhanced after activation of Na+-glucose cotransport (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D. Kerner R. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1378-C1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several kinases can phosphorylate MLC, including MLCK (8Adelstein R.S. Cell. 1982; 30: 349-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Rho kinase (9Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 243-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Of these, only MLCK and Rho kinase have been implicated in tight junction regulation (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L.

MLC phosphorylation is also regulated by MLC phosphatase, which can be controlled by Rho kinase (26Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of these regulators of MLC phosphorylation to Na+-glucose contransport-dependent tight junction regulation, we measured the effect of MLCK, Rho kinase, and phosphatase inhibitors on TER in monolayers with active Na+-glucose contransport (Fig. 2A). In control monolayers with active Na+-glucose cotransport, TER was 30 ± 4% less than that of monolayers with inactive Na+-glucose cotransport. PIK, a membrane permeant peptide inhibitor of MLCK (1Turner J.R. Rill B.K. Carlson S.L. Carnes D. Kerner R. Mrsny R.J. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1378-C1385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Zolotarevsky Y. Hecht G. Koutsouris A. Gonzalez D.E. Quan C. Tom J. Mrsny R.J. Turner J.R.

In contrast, neither the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 nor the phosphatase inhibitor calyculin A significantly altered the TER of monolayers with active Na+-glucose cotransport, suggesting that neither Rho kinase nor myosin phosphatase are critically involved in Na+-glucose cotransport-dependent tight junction regulation. A 215-kDa MLCK Is the Principal Caco-2 Cell MLC Kinase—As we have shown previously (27Turner J.R. Angle J.M. Black E.D. Joyal J.L. Sacks D.B. Madara J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C554-C562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), immunoblot of Caco-2 cell lysates with a monoclonal antibody that reacts broadly with myosin light chain kinases detected only a single ∼215-kDa protein consistent with long MLCK (Fig. 2B). To determine whether this was the principal MLC kinase expressed in Caco-2 cells, this protein was removed from Caco-2 lysates by immunodepletion. This removed 97 ± 4% of MLC kinase activity from the lysates (Fig. 2C). Thus, the 215-kDa MLCK is the principal enzyme responsible for MLC phosphorylation in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. Splice Variants 1 and 2 of Long MLCK Are Expressed in the Intestinal Epithelium—Two primary isoforms of MLCK are transcribed from the smooth muscle MLCK gene using separate promoters: a 130-kDa short MLCK and a 210-kDa long MLCK (14Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4527-4530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Based on the size of the MLCK detected in Fig. 2B, we hypothesized that long MLCK is the 215-kDa MLCK found in Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. To determine whether the 215-kDa Caco-2 MLCK is long MLCK, we cloned and sequenced long MLCK from Caco-2 cell mRNA. A full-length 5.8-kb transcript was detected, consistent with long MLCK (Fig. 3A). Previous analysis of endothelial long MLCK has identified at least five splice variants of long MLCK as a result of 207-, 204-, and 153-base pair in-frame deletions (15Lazar V. Garcia J.G. Genomics. 1999; 57: 256-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These variations in length are too small to be detectable by agarose gel electrophoresis of the full-length 5.8-kb transcript; thus we amplified and sequenced smaller portions of long MLCK cDNA individually (Fig. 3, B and C"
https://openalex.org/W2098613610,"Descriptions of human genetic variation given thirty years ago have held up well, considering the substantial accrual of DNA sequence data in the interim. Most importantly, estimates of between-group genetic variation have remained relatively low. Despite the low average level of between-group variation, clusters recently inferred from multilocus genetic data coincide closely with groups defined by self-identified race or continental ancestry. This correspondence implies that genetic factors might contribute to unexplained between-group phenotypic variation. Current understanding of the contribution of genes to variation in most complex traits is limited, however. Under these circumstances, assumptions about genetic contributions to group differences are unfounded. In the absence of detailed understanding, 'racial' and 'ethnic' categories will remain useful in biomedical research. Further, we suggest approaches and guidelines for assessing the contribution of genetic factors to between-group phenotypic differences, including studies of candidate genes and analyses of recently admixed populations."

These questions underlie the discussions that address the explanations for the observed differences in many domains between named demographic groups across societies. These domains include disease incidence and prevalence and other variables studied by biologists and social scientists. Here, we offer a perspective on understanding human variation by exploring the meaning and use of the term 'race' and its relationship to a range of data.

https://openalex.org/W2068050272,"MITF and its related family members TFE3 and TFEB heterodimerize with each other, recognize the same DNA sequences, and are subject to many of the same post-translational modifications. We show that lysine residues within conserved small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) consensus sites in these family members are subject to SUMO modification. Mutation of these sites significantly affects the transcriptional activity of MITF but does not alter dimerization, DNA binding, stability, or nuclear localization. Mutagenesis reducing the number of MITF binding sites in the promoter of TRPM1 from three to one eliminated the difference in transcriptional activity between the MITF mutants. Among other MITF target gene promoter constructs, differences in transcriptional activity between wild type and non-sumoylatable MITF were only seen in promoters with multiple MITF binding sites. These data support a synergy control model in which the functional consequences of MITF sumoylation depend on promoter context. Sumoylation, thus, provides a possible mechanism for altering the effects of MITF by affecting the target genes that it activates.

MITF is a tissue-restricted, basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper dimeric transcription factor. It is encoded by the mitf locus in mice (1Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E.

Mitf mutant mice are white due to a complete lack of melanocytes, whereas heterozygotes have a white belly spot (1Hodgkinson C.A. Moore K.J. Nakayama A. Steingrimsson E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A.

MITF continues to be necessary in the adult based on the existence of hypomorphic alleles in mice which cause postnatal melanocyte death and premature graying (3Lerner A.B. Shiohara T. Boissy R.E.

As a transcriptional mediator of differentiation, MITF acts down-stream of the melanizing hormone α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (5Price E.R. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Weilbaecher K.N.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1712-1728PubMed Google Scholar). Although these data implicate MITF in both the survival and differentiation of melanocytes, little is known about biochemical regulatory pathways that control MITF in these different roles. MITF is part of the MiT transcription factor family whose members share significant homology and recognize the same DNA elements. Functionally, MITF binds to the canonical E-box promoter sequence CACGTG as well as to the non-palindromic sequence CACATG (7Hemesath T.J. Steingrimsson E. McGill G. Hansen M.J. Vaught J.

MITF functions as either a homodimer or as a heterodimer with the related MiT family transcription factors TFE3, TFEB, and TFEC (62Mansky K.C. Sulzbacher S. Purdom G. Nelsen L. Hume D.A. Rehli M. Ostrowski M.C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 71: 304-310PubMed Google Scholar).

The structural features of these family members are so similar that MITF and TFE3 have been shown to genetically compensate for one another in regulation of osteoclast development in mice (12Steingrimsson E.

Several post-translational modifications affect members of the MiT family. In melanocytes, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway by c-Kit leads to phosphorylation of MITF (9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E.

In osteosclasts, macrophage colony-stimulating factor signaling initiates a parallel pathway resulting in mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of both MITF and TFE3 at a conserved serine, thereby triggering recruitment of p300 (15Weilbaecher K.N.

In several transcription factors, including glucocorticoid receptor, androgen receptor, C/EBPα, C/EBPϵ, c-Myb, and SP3, the consensus site for sumoylation (ΨKXE) has also been identified as part of a region that negatively regulates function (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Further analysis of this transcriptional repression by SUMO in several systems has led to the suggestion that sumoylation functions in synergy control (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Pearce D. Mol. Cell.

In this model, sumoylation of a transcription factor represses transcriptional activity at promoters with multiple binding sites (for review, see Ref. 42Courey A.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 250-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In one model system using glucocorticoid receptor, mutations of several residues in a motif nearly identical to the sumoylation consensus site led to greater transcriptional activity in the mutants. Intriguingly, this effect was only apparent on promoter constructs that harbored multiple glucocorticoid response elements (41Holmstrom S. Van Antwerp M.E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15758-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Later work involving C/EBPα showed similar results but also suggested that this effect on synergy indeed correlates with sumoylation at the lysine residue within the synergy control motif (43Subramanian L.

Alignment of the MITF amino acid sequence revealed the presence of two conserved sumoylation consensus sites in the mouse and human homologues.

MITF was indeed found to be subject to SUMO modification, as were the related family members TFE3 and TFEB. Mutations affecting sumoylation had significant functional consequences on transcriptional activity of MITF, which did not appear to influence dimerization, DNA binding, stability, or nuclear localization. Instead, evidence was obtained suggesting that the difference in transcriptional activity among the MITF mutants depends on the number of MITF binding sites within the promoter, fitting a synergy control model (39Iniguez-Lluhi J.A.

These findings identify sumoylation as a post-translational MITF modification that affects MITF transcriptional activity in a manner dependent on the promoter elements present in MITF target genes. Plasmids—The M-form MITF constructs pcDNA4HisMax-MITF (His-MITF) and pcDNA3.1HA-MITF (HA-MITF) have been described previously (45Miller A.J. Du J. Rowan S. Hershey C.L. Widlund H.R. Fisher D.E.

To create a plasmid encoding TFEB, cDNA was generated from primary human papillary renal cell carcinoma cell mRNA through reverse transcription (Superscript) after priming with oligo(dT).

The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Fragments were isolated by digestion with EcoRI and SacI or SacI and BamHI, respectively, then ligated into the EcoRI and BamHI sites of pCDNA3.1(-).

HA-tagged or His-tagged ubiquitin expression vectors were a gift from Dr. Dirk Bohmann, European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing. Stable Lines—B16 melanoma grown in 10-cm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of pBabe-puro and 9 μg of His-SUMO-1 (His-SUMO lines) or 9 μg of pcDNA4.1HisMaxLacZ (Invitrogen) (Control cell lines) using Fu-GENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 48 h after transfection, cells were split 1:10 into media containing 2.0 μg/ml puromycin. Cells grew under selection for 14 days, and 24 single colonies of each line were isolated. 12 clones were assayed for SUMO-1 overexpression by comparison to control cell lines via Western blot using anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (Santa Cruz sc-9806). Reporter Assays—B16 melanoma, COS7, and 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) plus penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine (Invitrogen) and transiently transfected using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For all reporter assays, cells were plated into 24-well tissue culture plates. 24 h later triplicate transfections were performed with the indicated amounts of pTRPM1, pCATHK, pSILV, or pTYR luciferase reporter plasmid, 100 ng of pRL-Null Renilla control reporter plasmid, and the indicated amounts of wild type or mutant His-MITF, HA-SUMO, or pcDNA3 control. Total amounts of DNA were kept constant in individual experiments, as indicated. 36 h post-transfection cells were lysed in passive lysis buffer for 20 min at room temperature, and an aliquot was used for reporter assays using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to the Renilla activity, and all assays were performed on three occasions. Co-transfections and Immunoblots—COS-7 or HEK293 cells grown in 6-well dishes were transfected with the indicated plasmids (2 μg of total DNA/well). 48 hours later, cells were harvested. Whole cell lysates were prepared by rinsing cells in room temperature PBS followed by lysis in 95 °C in 2× lysis/loading buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, and 0.04% pyronin Y) and boiling an additional 5 min. Denaturing lysis/immunoprecipitation was carried out according to previously published methods (52Buschmann T. Fuchs S.Y. Lee C.G. Pan Z.Q. Ronai Z. Cell. 2000; 101: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared for affinity pull-down assays with Ni-NTA-agarose beads (Qiagen) in denaturing conditions by lysis in 8 m urea lysis buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.3), passage through a 25-gauge needle 5 times to shear DNA, and clearing by 5 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. His-tagged proteins were purified by 1 h of incubation with Ni-NTA resin at room temperature followed by 5 washes in 8 m urea wash buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.3), elution with 8 m urea elution buffer (8 m urea, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.3), and boiling in 6× SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 10% SDS, 0.6 m dithiothreitol, and 0.012% bromphenol blue). Lysates were prepared for native affinity pull down assays with Ni-NTA-agarose beads by cooling cells on ice, washing twice in ice-cold PBS, lysing in cold native lysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0, with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)), passage through a 25-gauge needle 5 times to shear DNA, and clearing by 5 min of centrifugation at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. His-tagged proteins were purified by 1 h of incubation with Ni-NTA resin at 4 °C followed by 5 washes in wash buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0), elution with elution buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0), and boiling in 6× SDS sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis in 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels or 4–20% gradient gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran® from Schleicher & Schuell). All proteins were detected using chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and antibodies to MITF (C5), HA epitope (Roche Applied Science), or α-tubulin (Sigma). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (14Wu M. Hemesath T.J. Takemoto C.M. Horstmann M.A. Wells A.G. Price E.R. Fisher D.Z. Fisher D.E.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were otherwise performed as previously described (45Miller A.J. Du J. Rowan S. Hershey C.L. Widlund H.R. Fisher D.E. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence—COS-7 or 293 cells were grown in 6-well dishes and transfected with 100 ng of MITF plasmid and 900 ng of pcDNA using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 24 h later cells were replated onto coverslips in 24-well plates. 24 h later cells were fixed for 10 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, washed in PBS, and permeabilized for 5 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Next, samples were washed 3 times in PBS for 5 min, blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 10% fetal bovine serum, PBS), washed once with PBS, and stained overnight with monoclonal anti-MITF antibody (C5) in 1% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Samples were then washed 3 times in PBS for 5 min and stained secondarily with Alexa-488 conjugated goat-anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes) in blocking buffer. Cells were washed once in PBS, counterstained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, washed 4 times in PBS for 5 min, and mounted using Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotech, Birmingham AL). Microscopy was performed at a 630× total magnification using a Zeiss Axioplan 2, and imaging was performed with a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera and Openlab 3.l software. MITF Degradation and Ubiquitination—293 or COS7 cells were transfected in 10-cm dishes with 5 μg of His-MITF wild type and 5 μg of pcDNA3, 5 μg of His-MITF K182R/K316R and 5 μg of pcDNA3, or 5 μg of His-MITF and 5 μg of HA-SUMO-1 using FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 24 h after transfection cells were replated into six-well dishes. After a further 24 h, cells were treated with cyclohexamide for 15 min before the addition of TPA (100 nm) at the indicated time points. COS7 cells grown in 6-well dishes were transfected with 1 μg of HA-MITF wild type or K182R/K316R and 1 μg of His-ubiquitin. Cells were lysed under denaturing conditions, and His-tagged proteins were precipitated using Ni-NTA as described previously. MITF Is Modified by SUMO-1 in Vivo—When the melanocyte (M) forms of MITF and SUMO-1 were overexpressed in COS-7 cells, additional forms were observed at molecular masses of ∼20 and ∼40 kDa greater than expected in addition to the regular doublet of MITF (due to phosphorylation by mitogen-activated protein kinase at serine 73 (9Hemesath T.J. Price E.R. Takemoto C. Badalian T. Fisher D.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 298-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar)) typically seen (data not shown). When cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer at 95 °C and immediately boiled, these higher molecular mass forms were much more abundant. Because these cells do not express the A-form of MITF, which is also larger than the transfected M-form of MITF, these bands apparently represent altered mobility forms of M-MITF. To demonstrate that these forms result specifically from sumoylation, we adopted the approach of using His-tagged proteins, which can be affinity-purified under denaturing conditions using Ni-NTA resins and 8 m urea, which has previously been used to stabilize SUMO modifications (53Buschmann T. Lerner D. Lee C.G. Ronai Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40389-40395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 54David G. Neptune M.A. DePinho R.A. J. Biol.

Using His-tagged MITF and HA-SUMO-1, the same higher molecular mass species of MITF as seen in hot SDS lysates were apparent in Ni-NTA affinity purifications of His-tagged proteins (single and double asterisks in Fig. 1A). To further verify that this aberrant mobility occurred because of sumoylation, we reversed the tags and utilized His-SUMO-1 and HA-MITF. Similar complexes were present in the lysates from such transfections, and when His-SUMO-1-modified proteins were isolated by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography, upper bands with ∼20- and ∼40-kDa slower mobility than w"

The activated glucocorticoid receptor initiates a transcriptional program leading to caspase activation and cell death, but the critical signaling intermediates in GC-induced apoptosis remain largely undefined. We have observed that GC induction of the three major protein products of the Bcl-2 relative Bim (BimEL, BimS, and BimL) correlates with GC sensitivity in a panel of human precursor B-cell (pre-B) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines. To test the hypothesis that Bim facilitates GC-induced apoptosis, we reduced BIM mRNA levels and Bim protein levels by RNA interference in highly GC-sensitive pre-B ALL cells. Reducing Bim proteins by either electroporation of synthetic small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes or lentivirus-mediated stable expression of short hairpin RNA inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and increased cell viability following GC exposure. We also observed that the extent of GC resistance correlated with siRNA silencing potency. siRNA duplexes that reduced only BimEL or BimEL and BimL (but not BimS) exhibited less GC resistance than a potent siRNA that silenced all three major isoforms, implying that induction of all three Bim proteins contributes to cell death. Finally, the modulation of GC-induced apoptosis caused by Bim silencing was independent of Bcl-2 expression levels, negating the hypothesis that the ratio of Bim to Bcl-2 regulates apoptosis. These results offer evidence that the induction of Bim by GC is a required event for the complete apoptotic response in pre-B ALL cells.

Synthetic GCs such as dexamethasone and triamcinolone acetonide (TA) are widely prescribed pharmaceuticals for indications ranging from inflammation to cancer. GCs induce apoptosis in numerous lymphoid and myeloid tissues and have been successful in the treatment of childhood leukemias (1Planey S.L. Litwack G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The mechanism of GC-induced apoptosis involves the hallmarks of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, i.e. the release of cytochrome c and Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) from the mitochondria and the activation of caspase-9 (2Planey S.L.

Determining the molecular trigger(s) that commit the cell to the activation of intrinsic apoptosis might enable strategies to combat GC-resistant leukemias. Precursor B-cell (pre-B) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common childhood cancer and a useful model to investigate the mechanism of GC-induced apoptosis (3Findley Jr., H.W. Cooper M.D. Kim T.H. Alvarado C. Ragab A.H. Blood. 1982; 60: 1305-1309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GC signaling occurs through the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a nuclear receptor superfamily member that dissociates from a large Hsp70-containing complex and translocates to the nucleus upon GC binding (reviewed in Ref. 4Wright A.P.

The activated GR initiates a tissue-specific transcriptional program through both direct DNA binding and interaction with other transcription factors. Numerous studies with actinomycin D and cyclo-heximide have demonstrated that new transcription and protein synthesis, respectively, are required for GC-induced apoptosis (5McConkey D.J. Nicotera P.

Bim protein is in the “BH3-only” subset of Bcl-2 relatives, a group that also includes Bid, Bad, Puma, and Noxa. BH3-only proteins are transcriptionally activated, post-translationally modified, or released from sequestration in response to death stimuli and promote apoptosis by interacting with Bcl-2 family members that contain multiple BH domains (BH1-BH4) (reviewed in Ref. 11Borner C.

Finally, lowering BIM mRNA by RNAi causes partial protection against apoptosis induced by the drugs paclitaxel (19Sunters A. Fernandez de Mattos S. Stahl M. Brosens J.J. Zoumpoulidou G. Saunders C.A.

The BIM gene is transcribed as three major spice variants, BIM EL, BIM L, and BIM S, encoding the functionally distinct proteins BimEL, BimL, and BimS, respectively (23O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). The BimS protein has been widely reported to be the most strongly proapoptotic of the three, although there may be exceptions (16Shinjyo T. Kuribara R. Inukai T. Hosoi H. Kinoshita T. Miyajima A. Houghton P.J. Look A.T. Ozawa K. Inaba T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 854-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Only BimEL is likely to be regulated by phosphorylation and caspase-3 cleavage (24Chen D. Zhou Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 1235-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Both BimEL and BimL (but not BimS) may be sequestered by LC8, a subunit of the dynein motor complex (25Puthalakath H. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. King S.M. Strasser A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar), although the significance of this interaction has recently been questioned (26Zhu Y. Swanson B.J. Wang M. Hildeman D.A. Schaefer B.C. Liu X. Suzuki H. Mihara K. Kappler J. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7681-7686Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory (7Planey S.L. Abrams M.T. Robertson N.M. Litwack G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 172-178PubMed Google Scholar) and others (9Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have led to speculation that the transcriptional induction of Bim is required for GC-induced apoptosis. Only correlative evidence has thus far been generated in leukemic cells. To test this hypothesis directly, we used RNAi (28Scherr M. Morgan M.A. Eder M. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) to reduce BIM mRNA levels and found that both synthetic siRNAs and lentiviral-expressed shRNAs rendered human 697 pre-B ALL cells partially resistant to GC and inhibited GC-induced caspase-3 activity. Using splice variant-specific siRNAs, we found that all three major isoforms contribute to GC-induced apoptosis. Finally, we demonstrate that the Bim/Bcl-2 ratio is not a critical parameter in this pathway, suggesting that Bim functions primarily in a Bcl-2-independent manner in pre-B ALL cells. Cell Culture and Reagents—The pre-B ALL cells lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Nalm-6, Kasumi-2, and Kopn-8 cells were acquired from DSMZ (Braunschweig, Germany). TA, Polybrene, and all other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise indicated. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Electroporation of siRNA—siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). The sense strand sequences of the RNA duplexes used were as follows: control siRNA (firefly luciferase), 5′-CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA(dTdT)-3′; KIF11, 5′-AACUGAAGACCUGAAGACAAU(dTdT)-3′; BIM#1, 5′-ACCGAGAAGGUAGACAAUU(dTdT)-3′; BIM#2, 5′-CUACCUCCCUACAGACAGA(dTdT)-3′; BIM EL, 5′-CUCGAUCCUCCAGUGGGUA(dTdT)-3′; BIM EL plus BIM L (5′-CAGCACCCAUGAGUUGUGA(dTdT)-3′; BCL2#1, 5′AGAUAGUGAUGAAGUACAUUU-3′; BCL2#2, 5′-GAAGUACAUCCAUUAUAAGUU-3′; and BCL2#3, 5′-GGGAGAUAGUGAUGAAGUAUU-3′. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 25 mm HEPES (no phenol red or antibiotics) at 107 cells/ml. A 200-μl aliquot of cells was added to a 0.2-cm gap electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad) along with 10 μl of a 20 μm stock of siRNA and then incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were then electroporated with a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser using the indicated conditions, incubated for an additional 20 min, and added to 2 ml of the above medium (excluding aggregated cell debris) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Thus, the final concentration of siRNA is 100 nm following electroporation. The standard condition of 500-microfarad capacitance (see “Results”) achieved a pulse length of 7-8 ms. Vehicle (0.05% ethanol) or TA was added after the indicated recovery times. Cell Cycle Analysis and Viability Assays—Electroporated and drug-treated 697 cells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed with 70% ethanol. After fixing for 18 h at 4 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 1 ml of staining solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml RNase A, and 1 mg/ml glucose in PBS. Cells were analyzed for DNA content using a Beckman Coulter XL flow cytometer after 2 h of staining. 10,000 cells were counted per sample. Percentages of cells in sub-G0 or G2/M cell cycle fractions were determined using WinMDI software (Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA). Trypan blue exclusion assays were performed in triplicate, counting >200 cells per sample. Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were washed once in PBS and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 1× Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). 30-50 μg of each whole cell extract was electrophoresed on Novex 12% Tris-Gly polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoblots were performed using antibodies against Bim (1:20000 dilution; catalog number 202000, Calbiochem), Bcl-2 (1:10000; clone 100, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), and GAPDH (1:20000; clone 6C5, Research Diagnostics, Flanders, NJ) using standard methods and detected using chemoluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrates (Pierce). Densitometry analyses were performed by generating net intensity values using Kodak 1D software (Rochester, NY). RT-PCR—Total RNA was purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RT-PCR was performed in 50-μl reactions using 100 ng of RNA, 0.5 μm each primer, and an annealing temperature of 53 °C for 25 cycles. All other PCR conditions and reagents were supplied and recommended by the manufacturer's protocol for the Titan one-step system (Roche Applied Science). Primer sequences for BIM were 5′-GAGAAGGTAGACAATTGCAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GACAATGTAACGTAACAGTCG-3′ (reverse); for GAPDH the primers were 5′-CACCCATGGCAAATTCCATG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGT-3′ (reverse). Caspase Analysis—For the caspase-3 substrate cleavage assay, one transfection was performed for each data point. Cells were washed with PBS, lysed, and assayed in a 96-well plate using the EnzCheck caspase-3 assay kit (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Fluorescence was measured at emission and excitation settings of 485 and 530 nm, respectively, with a Bio-Tek (Winooski, VT) FL600 plate reader. For immunofluorescence, 50,000 cells were spun onto microscope slides, fixed, and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100, immunostained with an anti-active caspase-3 antibody diluted 1:50 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fluorescent detection was performed with the Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) biotin/avidin system and Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes). Lentivirus Generation and Infection—The lentiviral transfer and packaging vectors were a generous gift from Dr. Xiao-Feng Qui. Lentivirus production was conducted by co-transfection of HEK293T cells with four plasmids, i.e. a packaging defective helper construct (pMDL-g/pRRE; 3 μg), a Rev-expressing construct (pRSV-Rev; 3 μg), a construct expressing a heterologous envelope protein (pCMV-VSVg; 5 μg), and a transfer vector harboring a specific shRNA sequence under control of the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter (pH1UG/Luc-shRNA or pH1UG/Bim-shRNA; 10 μg). Briefly, 3 × 106 HEK293T cells were seeded on 10-cm plates 24 h before transfection. For each shRNA, 100 μl of FuGENE-6 (Roche Applied Science) was combined with the four plasmids in 3 ml of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium. The mixture was added dropwise onto the cells after a 30-min incubation, and the cells were analyzed for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression by fluorescence microscopy after 24 h. At 48 h, virus-containing cell supernatants were collected and centrifuged twice to eliminate transfer of cells. shRNA-encoding pH1UG vectors were created by cloning annealed complementary oligonucleotides into BamHI and XhoI sites at the 3′ of the H1 RNA polymerase III promoter. The coding strand sequences of the shRNA-encoding oligonucleotides are 5′-GATCCCCCGTATGCGGAATACTTTGATTCAAGAGATCGAAGTATTCCGCGTACGTTTTTC-3′ for control (luciferase) and 5′-GATCCCCGACTGAGAAGGTAGATAATTTTCAAGAGAAATTGTCTACCTTCTCGGTCTTTTTC-3′ for BIM. The BIM shRNA sequence used was modeled after the BIM#1 siRNA sequence. The 697 cells were infected by adding 1 ml of viral supernatant supplemented with 4 μg/ml Polybrene to 5 × 104 cells in 24-well plates. The viral supernatant was replaced with standard growth medium after 24 h, and infection efficiency was monitored by GFP expression after 48 h. Viral titers were calculated by counting GFP-positive cells after infecting with serial dilutions of the viral supernatant. Northern Analysis—Total RNA was prepared from shRNA-expressing cell lines using Tri reagent (Sigma) according to the vendor's protocol. 30 μg of RNA were electrophoresed on a Tris borate-EDTA-urea 15% acrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and transferred to a Zeta Probe nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were UV light-cross-linked and probed with an 32P-5′-end-labeled Bim antisense probe (5′-AATTGTCTACCTTCTCGGTC-3′) at 42 °C for 18 h. For the two hybridization control oligonucleotides (perfect match and two-base mismatch), the two complementary BIM shRNA-encoding oligonucleotides were used because wobble base-pairing in the shRNA design (29Paddison P.J. Caudy A.A. Sachidanandam R. Hannon G.J. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 265: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar) created two mismatches in the sense sequence of the coding strand oligonucleotide. The pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 relative Bim has been shown to be up-regulated by GC in GC-sensitive lymphocytes, suggesting that Bim may function as an early sensor for intrinsic apoptosis (7Planey S.L. Abrams M.T. Robertson N.M. Litwack G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 172-178PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wang Z. Malone M.H. He H. McColl K.S. Distelhorst C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23861-23867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 27Zhang L. Insel P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is a correlation between Bim induction and GC sensitivity in human pre-B ALL cells, we monitored a panel of human pre-B ALL cell lines for viability in response to the potent GC triamcinolone acetonide after 48- and 72-h exposures (Fig. 1, A and B). Significant cell death was observed in the cell line 697 at low doses (5 nm) after 48 h, but the other lines tested (Kasumi-2, Kopn-8, and Nalm-6) showed no effect after 48 h and only slight (Kasumi-2, Kopn-8) or moderate (Nalm-6) cell death at the 72-h time point. We then compared the effect of TA on Bim protein levels in the sensitive and resistant cells (Fig. 1C). We observed that the three major Bim proteins (BimEL, BimL, and BimS) (23O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) increased after 24 h in the 697 cells but not in the other pre-B ALL cell lines. In addition, basal levels of the Bim proteins were low or undetectable in the GC-resistant lines. To further explore the kinetics of Bim induction by GC, the 697 cells were also exposed to GC for shorter time points, showing rapid up-regulation of the three Bim proteins after a 4 or 8 h exposure to 100 nm TA (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data suggest that Bim expression and induction are factors in determining the pro-apoptotic response to GC in pre-B ALL. We then sought to reduce Bim expression in 697 cells by RNAi. The use of synthetic siRNAs has not been widely reported for lymphocytes, primarily because of the technical difficulty of nucleic acid transfection in non-adherent cultures. It has previously been shown that, for lymphocytes, electroporation is a more efficient delivery method for synthetic nucleic acids than liposome-mediated transfection (30Weil D. Garcon L. Harper M. Dumenil D. Dautry F. Kress M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). However, the cytotoxicity caused by the cellular stress of electroporation has often been too significant to perform downstream viability measurements. It has been reported (30Weil D. Garcon L. Harper M. Dumenil D. Dautry F. Kress M. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: 1244-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) that an siRNA against the KIF11 gene, which encodes the mitotic kinesin KSP (also known as Eg5), is an effective tool to optimize transfection conditions because of its ability to induce mitotic block. To determine conditions for electroporating siRNAs into human 697 pre-B lymphocytes, we tested several RNA concentrations and capacitance settings using a KIF11-targeting siRNA. After 48 h, cell cycle analysis was performed using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Under optimized settings (220 V/500 microfarads), the percentage of cells blocked in the G2/M stage was 2-fold higher for the KSP siRNA as compared with that for control siRNA (Fig 2A), indicating that the level of transfection was sufficient to explore biological phenotypes. We also verified that RNA uptake occurred in >90% of the cells under these transfection conditions using a nonspecific siRNA labeled with Cy3 (data not shown). Importantly, the relatively mild electroporation conditions resulted in a minimal accumulation of sub-G1/G0 cells, indicating that this RNA delivery method caused negligible cell death and is therefore suitable for performing downstream viability studies. These electroporation conditions were used for all subsequent siRNA experiments. Finally, increasing the capacitance setting or the siRNA concentration did not further increase the percentage of cells blocked in G2/M (Fig. 2B). 24 h after transfection with two BIM-targeting siRNAs, steady state levels of BimEL, BimL, and BimS were markedly reduced compared with those of a control siRNA sequence (Fig. 3A). Neither of the BIM-targeting siRNAs affected expression of the housekeeping protein GAPDH (Fig. 3A) or the other Bcl-2 family members Bax and Bad (data not shown). To determine whether the siRNA can reduce the level of Bim even after its expression is up-regulated by GC, we treated the cells with TA (100 nm) 24 h after siRNA electroporation. The 24-h recovery after electroporation allows for degradation of the existing Bim protein, the rapid turnover rate of which can be attributed in part to ubiquitin-proteasome processing (31Ley R. Balmanno K. Hadfield K. Weston C. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 18811-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Both siRNAs caused a marked reduction in not only basal Bim expression but also in the TA-induced levels of the three major splice variants relative to a control sequence (Fig 3A, right). The more potent Bim siRNA (sequence 2) caused a 70% reduction in basal BimEL (n = 4) and a 30% reduction in TA-induced BimEL (n = 2) (Fig. 3A, right, compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes 5 and 6, counting from the left). To explore the RNAi effect at the mRNA level, we performed RT-PCR on total RNA isolated from siRNA-transfected 697 cells. The use of end point RT-PCR allows for visualization of all three major splice variants. Immediately following a 20-min post-electroporation recovery incubation (see “Materials and Methods”), the transfected cells were treated with vehicle or TA (100 nm) and then harvested 2.5, 5, or 7.5 h later. The mRNAs corresponding to the three major splice variants were effectively reduced by the BIM-targeting siRNA only 2.5 h after electroporation and reached near maximal silencing by that early time point, as further incubation to 7.5 h had little additional effect. Treatment of the cells with TA caused BIM mRNA induction relative to vehicle-treated controls, which was effectively abrogated by the siRNA (Fig 3B). To determine whether targeting Bim affects the apoptotic machinery in the 697 cells, we analyzed cells for caspase-3 activation (cleavage) and caspase-3 enzyme activity. Cells were electroporated as above, allowed to recover for 24 h (to allow for the degradation of pre-existing Bim protein), and then treated with TA (5 nm) for 24 h. This low, physiologically-relevant GC concentration corresponds to the approximate Kd of TA for the receptor (32Zhang S. Danielsen M. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1995; 50: 429-435PubMed Google Scholar). After the 24-h drug exposure, cells were immunostained with an antibody specific for the active (cleaved) form of caspase-3. Silencing of Bim reduced TA-induced caspase-3 activation, reflecting a decrease in activity of its upstream activator, caspase-9 (Fig 4A). To confirm these results, we also monitored the enzymatic activity of caspase-3 by assaying for cleavage of the fluorescent substrate, DEVD-rhodamine-110, as described (33Liu J. Bhalgat M. Zhang C. Diwu Z. Hoyland B. Klaubert"
https://openalex.org/W1965630120,"Betacellulin belongs to the family of epidermal growth factor-like growth factors that are expressed as transmembrane precursors and undergo proteolytic ectodomain shedding to release a soluble mature growth factor. In this study, we investigated the ectodomain shedding of the betacellulin precursor (pro-BTC) in conditionally immortalized wild-type (WT) and ADAM-deficient cell lines. Sequential ectodomain cleavage of the predominant cell-surface 40-kDa form of pro-BTC generated a major (26–28 kDa) and two minor (20 and 15 kDa) soluble forms and a cellular remnant lacking the ectodomain (12 kDa). Pro-BTC shedding was activated by calcium ionophore (A23187) and by the metalloprotease activator p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA), but not by phorbol esters. Culturing cells in calcium-free medium or with the protein kinase Cδ inhibitor rottlerin, but not with broad-based protein kinase C inhibitors, blocked A23187-activated pro-BTC shedding. These same treatments were without effect for constitutive and APMA-induced cleavage events. All pro-BTC shedding was blocked by treatment with a broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor (GM6001). In addition, constitutive and activated pro-BTC shedding was differentially blocked by TIMP-1 or TIMP-3, but was insensitive to treatment with TIMP-2. Pro-BTC shedding was functional in cells from ADAM17- and ADAM9-deficient mice and in cells overexpressing WT or catalytically inactive ADAM17. In contrast, overexpression of WT ADAM10 enhanced constitutive and activated shedding of pro-BTC, whereas overexpression of catalytically inactive ADAM10 reduced shedding. These results demonstrate, for the first time, activated pro-BTC shedding in response to extracellular calcium influx and APMA and provide evidence that ADAM10 mediates constitutive and activated pro-BTC shedding.

The extracellular N-terminal ectodomain can be proteolytically cleaved to release the mature active growth factor, which can then bind ErbB receptors in an autocrine or paracrine fashion, resulting in the activation of multiple signal transduction cascades affecting cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and survival (1Holbro T.

Thus, knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which EGF-like growth factors are shed from the cell surface and the nature of the proteases that govern this process is crucial to understanding ErbB receptor signaling and potentially the development of novel cancer therapeutics. Recent studies have highlighted a clear role for members of the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase) family, in particular, the tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (ADAM17), as EGF-like factor “sheddases.” For example, mice that produce catalytically inactive ADAM17 protein that cannot bind Zn2+ (ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn) (8Peschon J.J.

Moreover, the eye, hair, and skin phenotypes of newborn ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn mice are identical to those reported previously for transforming growth factor-α (TGFα)–/– mice (17Luetteke N.C. Qiu T.H.

The involvement of ADAM17 in TGFα shedding and, additionally, amphiregulin, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), and neuregulin-α2c has been confirmed by the reduced shedding of these growth factors from ras- and myc-transformed embryonic fibroblasts derived from ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn mice that can be rescued by ectopic ADAM17 expression (9Sunnarborg S.W.

The role for ADAM17 in shedding of HB-EGF has been strengthened by the recent observation that ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn mice display similar heart and lung defects compared with HB-EGF–/– mice (21Jackson L.F.

In contrast to other members of the EGF-like growth factor family, two recent reports have shown that ADAM17 does not appear to be the primary sheddase responsible for shedding of the BTC precursor (pro-BTC). Rather, a role for ADAM10 at least in the basal shedding of pro-BTC has been proposed (30Hinkle C.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Loiselle D. Parker C.E. Stevenson M. Russell W.E. Lee D.C. J. Biol.

J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). The ectodomain shedding of pro-BTC has not been extensively characterized. Analysis of the pro-BTC cDNA suggests that the primary translation product encodes a signal sequence, N- and O-linked glycosylation sites, and a hydrophobic transmembrane region followed by a hydrophilic C terminus (32Dunbar A.J. Goddard C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2000; 32: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ectodomain shedding of pro-BTC has been demonstrated to involve a single C-terminal proteolytic cleavage between Tyr111 and Leu112 proximal to the transmembrane region (30Hinkle C.L.

Shintani A. Nakata M. Shing Y. Folkman J. Igarashi K. Sasada R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9966-9973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a detailed map of the molecular sizes and identity of BTC protein fragments generated by ectodomain shedding and demonstrate for the first time that the metalloprotease-dependent shedding of pro-BTC is activated by extracellular calcium influx and p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA). We also demonstrate that activated and constitutive pro-BTC shedding is sensitive to TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases) and TIMP-3, but not to TIMP-2, suggesting the involvement of one or more ADAM proteases and not MMPs. Constitutive and activated pro-BTC shedding was unaffected by ADAM17 overexpression or by an ADAM17 null mutation. Consistent with a possible role of ADAM10 in pro-BTC shedding (31Sahin U. Weskamp G. Kelly K. Zhou H.M. Higashiyama S. Peschon J. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 769-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), we show that overexpression of wild-type or catalytically inactive ADAM10 modulates constitutive and stimulus-induced pro-BTC shedding. Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibody reagents were used: goat anti-human BTC ectodomain (Asp32–Tyr111) antibody, biotinylated goat anti-human BTC ectodomain antibody, mouse anti-human BTC ectodomain antibody, rat anti-mouse ADAM10 antibody, and rabbit anti-human ADAM17 cytoplasmic domain antibody (R&D Systems); rabbit anti-hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.); horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Amersham Biosciences); and phycoerythrin-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG F(ab′)2 fragment (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Recombinant human BTC and mouse interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were purchased from R&D Systems. Calcium ionophore (A23187), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), APMA, concanavalin A (ConA)-agarose, and protease inhibitor mixture were purchased from Sigma. Sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate, SuperSignal West Pico substrate, heparin-agarose, streptavidin-agarose, and protein G- and A-agarose were obtained from Pierce. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. SP600123 was obtained from BIOMOL Research Labs Inc.

TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were generous gifts from Chris Overall (University of British Colombia), and TIMP-3 was a generous gift from John Doedens and Roy Black (Amgen). Cell Culture—The isolation and characterization of conditionally immortalized wild-type, ADAM17ΔZn/ΔZn, and ADAM9–/– dermal fibroblast and stomach epithelial cell lines have been described previously (34Garton K.J.

Cells were cultured at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal bovine serum/penicillin/streptomycin/nonessential amino acids and 5 units/ml IFN-γ. Prior to experiments, cells were cultured for 36 h at 37 °C in medium lacking IFN-γ to arrest immortalization by the SV40 large T antigen. All treatments were performed at 37 °C. Generation of Expression Constructs and Retroviral Transduction—A cDNA encoding human BTC containing a C-terminal HA epitope tag was generated by PCR amplification using flanking primers (5′-GGCCATTCTGGCCCGCCACCATGGACCGGGCCGCCCGGTGC and 3′-GGCCGCTGCGGCCCCGTAAAACAAGTCAACTCTCTC) containing unique SfiI restriction sites. For stable expression of BTC-HA alone, the full-length pro-BTC cDNA fragment was directionally subcloned into the first cistron of the pBM-IRES-PURO retroviral vector, which contains an HA epitope tag cassette flanked by 5′-SfiI and 3′-NotI restriction sites (34Garton K.J.

For coexpression with different ADAM cDNAs, BTC-HA was cloned into the pBM-IRES-EGFP vector (36Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z. Francke U. Reed J.C. Kinoshita S.

All cDNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. High titer retroviral supernatants were generated as described previously (36Hitoshi Y. Lorens J. Kitada S.I. Fisher J. LaBarge M. Ring H.Z.

For retroviral transduction, 4 × 105 wild-type or ADAM9- or ADAM17-deficient cells were seeded into 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks and cultured for 24 h prior to infection. Cells were incubated with 5 ml of virus stock for 12 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene and then replenished with fresh medium. For PURO vectors, cells were then grown for 48 h prior to passage into medium containing 2–5 μg/ml puromycin. Resistant cells were used in subsequent experiments. For ADAM coexpression experiments, cells were initially transduced with pBM-BTC-HA-IRES-EGFP retrovirus, and a pooled population of enhanced green fluorescent protein-positive cells was isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting using a MoFlo cytometer (Cytomation, Inc.). Indirect immunofluorescence was used to confirm BTC cell-surface expression. Subsequently, sorted cells were superinfected with pBM-IRES-PURO retroviruses expressing different ADAM constructs and then selected with puromycin as described above. BTC Cleavage Assays—Cells were seeded either at 1 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plates or at 3 × 105 cells in 100-mm dishes. Cells were grown for 48 h to confluence at 33 °C in medium containing IFN-γ and then for an additional 36 h at 37 °C in medium lacking IFN-γ. For analysis of constitutive shedding, cells were cultured for 24 h in serum-free DMEM plus 50 μm GM6001 or vehicle (Me2SO). To evaluate stimulated pro-BTC shedding, cells were cultured for 1 h in serum-free DMEM with or without APMA, A23187, or PMA. Preincubation of cells with GM6001, kinase inhibitors, calcium-free DMEM, or TIMPs was performed for 30 min prior to addition of shedding activators. For TIMP inhibition experiments, 4 × 104 cells were seeded into 24-well plates, and cells were used in shedding assays as described above. Conditioned media (CM) and cell lysates were then harvested. Biochemical Characterization of Cellular and Soluble BTC Forms— CM was harvested from cell cultures, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 2 mm. Cell monolayers were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated in lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitor mixture) for 30 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, CM and cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove cell debris. CM and cell lysates were used directly in the BTC enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and/or in immunoprecipitation and Western blot experiments. All samples were precleared prior to immunoprecipitation with appropriate antibodies. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce). For BTC ectodomain immunoprecipitation, CM and cell lysates were incubated overnight with affinity-purified goat anti-BTC antibody (2 μg), followed by 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose. For HA immunoprecipitation, CM and cell lysates were incubated with rabbit anti-HA antibody (2 μg), followed by 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose. For cell-surface biotinylation studies, cell monolayers were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido)hexanoate for 30 min at 4 °C. Labeling reagent was quenched by successive washes with PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Subsequently, cells were lysed in lysis buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and biotinylated proteins were precipitated by incubation with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of streptavidin-agarose. For detection of BTC forms that bind to heparin, CM or cell lysates were incubated overnight with 50 μl of a 50% slurry of heparin-agarose and washed twice with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). All CM, cell lysates, and precipitates were combined with sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 95 °C. All samples were then separated on 10–20% gradient Tris/Tricine gels, transferred to Hybond nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences), and subsequently immunoblotted with specific antibodies. After incubation with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, blots were developed using SuperSignal West Pico substrate. Direct detection of BTC in CM and cell lysates was performed by incubating immunoblots with biotinylated goat anti-BTC antibody (0.1 μg/ml), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized as described above. For ADAM coexpression experiments, the amounts of CM and cell lysates of each cell line loaded onto gels were normalized to the cellular BTC content in the presence of GM6001 as determined by ELISA. In some cases, nitrocellulose membranes were stripped by immersing in Restore™ Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were then reblocked and probed with another antibody. For metabolic labeling, cells were washed twice and incubated for 30 min with RPMI 1640 medium (lacking l-methionine) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. Cells were then pulse-labeled with 250 μCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min and chased in DMEM containing a 10-fold excess of unlabeled l-methionine. At different chase times, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed, and BTC was immunoprecipitated by overnight incubation with 2 μg of anti-HA antibody and 30 μl of a 50% slurry of protein A-agarose as described above. BTC immunoprecipitates were separated on 10–20% Tris/Tricine gels under reducing conditions and visualized by autoradiography. BTC ELISA—A specific human BTC sandwich ELISA (R&D Systems) was used to quantify BTC levels in CM and cell lysates according to the manufacturer's instructions. The recombinant human BTC ectodomain (R&D Systems) was used as a standard. ADAM Western Blotting—For detection of ADAM17 and ADAM10 in coexpression experiments, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 5 mm o-phenanthroline. ConA-agarose precipitates were prepared from cell lysates, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose as described above. Data Analysis—All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results, and a representative figure is presented. Values for each experiment are expressed as the means ± S.D. of quadruplicate determinations. Identification of Multiple Cellular and Shed Forms of BTC— For several EGF-like growth factors, including TGFα, HB-EGF, and amphiregulin, cell-surface ectodomain shedding and generation of soluble ligand are thought to be critical steps for functional ErbB receptor signaling. However, only limited knowledge about the sequential and regulated processing of EGF-like growth factors and the molecular mechanisms that control these shedding events is currently available. Soluble BTC forms have been detected in CM from BTC-expressing cell lines (7Tada H. Sasada R. Kawaguchi Y. Kojima I. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S. Igarashi K. Seno M. Yamada H. J. Cell.

In this study, we have further characterized the shedding of BTC using mouse dermal fibroblasts and stomach epithelial cells transduced with a retroviral BTC-HA expression construct (Fig. 1A).Table IPKCδ inhibitor rottlerin can inhibit A23187-induced pro-BTC sheddingTreatmentBTC sheddingConstitutiveA23187APMAVehicle100100100GM6001 (50 μm)211618Calcium-freeND4107Rottlerin (10 μm)1272397 Open table in a new tab Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using the anti-HA antibody detected five cellular BTC fragments of 40, 30, 25, 19, and 12 kDa in cell lysates from dermal fibroblasts transduced with BTC-HA (Fig. 1B, left panel). Immunoprecipitation with the anti-BTC ectodomain (Asp32–Tyr111) antibody (referred to as the anti-BTC antibody) or affinity purification with heparin-agarose and Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody did not detect the 12-kDa fragment, indicating that it did not contain the BTC ectodomain. This suggests that the 12-kDa form is the BTC cytoplasmic remnant generated by ectodomain shedding. The larger fragments, which contained the BTC ectodomain, represent candidate pro-BTC forms that undergo shedding. No additional bands were detected by immunoprecipitation with the anti-BTC antibody, indicating that there are only five cellular BTC species that all share the same C terminus. Analysis of CM from dermal fibroblasts expressing BTC-HA using the anti-BTC antibody or affinity purification with heparin-agarose detected one major but diffuse BTC species of ∼26–28 kDa (Fig. 1B, right panel). In agreement with previous results that the major soluble BTC forms detected in CM have variable N- and O-linked glycosylation (7Tada H. Sasada R. Kawaguchi Y. Kojima I. Gullick W.J. Salomon D.S.

The heterogeneity of the 26–28-kDa shed species is therefore likely to result from differences in post-translational glyco"

Together these metabolic changes contribute to cardiac dysfunction. Although AMPK signaling in the ischemic heart is well characterized, the relative contribution of phosphorylation by AMPK kinase (AMPKK), and positive allosterism by the ratios of AMP:ATP and creatine (Cr):phosphocreatine (PCr), in stimulating AMPK during ischemia are unknown. In hearts subjected to severe ischemia, the ratios of AMP:ATP and Cr:PCr were significantly elevated as compared with aerobic hearts. Severe ischemia stimulated AMPK signaling, as demonstrated by an increase in both AMPK activity and acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation. Although AMPK phosphorylation was increased by severe ischemia, the protein abundance and activity of the recently identified AMPKK, LKB1, were similar between aerobic and severely ischemic hearts. However, in contrast to LKB1, the activity of AMPKK was stimulated in severely ischemic hearts. To further delineate the relative roles of positive allosterism and AMPKK in the regulation of AMPK during ischemia, hearts were subjected to mild ischemia. Although mild ischemia did not alter the ratios of AMP:ATP and Cr:PCr, mild ischemia increased AMPK activity and increased AMPK phosphorylation. Mild ischemia also stimulated the activity of AMPKK. In summary, we demonstrate that myocardial ischemia stimulates AMPK via an AMPKK other than LKB1. Additionally, we show that changes in high energy phosphates are not essential for the activation of AMPK by ischemia.

During myocardial ischemia, the oxidative metabolism of glucose and fatty acids decreases due to the limited availability of oxygen (1Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 11A-16AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consequently, glycolysis initially increases to compensate for the decreased supply of ATP from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism (2Depre C. Vanoverschelde J.L. Taegtmeyer H. Circulation. 1999; 99: 578-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although oxidative metabolism is decreased during ischemia (1Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Cardiol. 1997; 80: 11A-16AAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), fatty acid oxidation predominates over glucose oxidation and hence is the major consumer of residual oxygen (3Neely J.R.

Importantly, the combined preferential oxidation of fatty acids and elevated rates of glycolysis lead to an increased production of protons and lactate in the ischemic heart, which contribute to cardiac inefficiency and contractile dysfunction (5Liu B.

Res. 1996; 79: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar).Several lines of evidence implicate 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase; AMPKK, AMPK kinase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Cr, creatine; PCr, phosphocreatine; DTT, dithiothreitol; PEG, polyethylene glycol. 1The abbreviations used are: AMPK, 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase; AMPKK, AMPK kinase; ACC, acetyl-CoA carboxylase; Cr, creatine; PCr, phosphocreatine; DTT, dithiothreitol; PEG, polyethylene glycol. as an important mediator of the metabolic changes in glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation that arise during and following myocardial ischemia. AMPK is rapidly activated during myocardial ischemia (6Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol.

Bergeron R. Shulman G.I. Young L.H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H643-H649PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, AMPK indirectly stimulates phosphofructokinase-1 activity by phosphorylating and activating the heart isoform of phosphofructokinase-2 (11Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Rider M.H. Deprez J.

Furthermore, AMPK also stimulates myocardial fatty acid oxidation (6Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol.

These events culminate in an accelerated rate of glycolysis and the preferential oxidation of fatty acids over glucose.AMPK is a member of an evolutionarily conserved family of serine/threonine protein kinases that function as sensors of the energy state of the cell (15Hardie D.G. Carling D. Halford N. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The heterotrimeric kinase is composed of a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ) (16Stapleton D. Gao G. Michell B.J. Widmer J. Mitchelhill K. Teh T. House C.M. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29343-29346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of AMPK is increased following association of the β and γ subunits with the α subunit (17Dyck J.R. Gao G. Widmer J. Stapleton D. Fernandez C.S. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17798-17803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Additionally, AMPK activity is altered by changes in the cellular levels of high energy phosphates (18Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Specifically, AMPK is allosterically activated by increases in the ratios of AMP: ATP (18Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) or creatine (Cr):phosphocreatine (PCr) (19Ponticos M. Lu Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Although positive allosterism plays an important role in regulating AMPK (18Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 19Ponticos M. Lu Q.L. Morgan J.E. Hardie D.G. Partridge T.A. Carling D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1688-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), it is now evident that it is not essential for AMPK activation (20Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Importantly, it has been found that changes in AMPK activity following ischemia, insulin, metformin, or hyperosmotic stress, do not correlate with the ratio of AMP:ATP (8Beauloye C. Marsin A.S. Bertrand L. Krause U. Hardie D.G. Vanoverschelde J.L. Hue L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 20Fryer L.G. Parbu-Patel A. Carling D. J. Biol.

Diabetes. 2002; 51: 2420-2425Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar).The catalytic activity of AMPK is also governed by the reversible phosphorylation of the residue Thr-172 (22Hawley S.A.

AMPK kinase (AMPKK) phosphorylates and activates AMPK (22Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (995) Google Scholar), whereas the protein phosphatases 2A and 2C dephosphorylate and thereby decrease the activity of AMPK (23Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Although early studies by Hardie's laboratory demonstrated that AMP enhances AMPKK activity in vitro (18Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 24Hawley S.A. Selbert M.A. Goldstein E.G. Edelman A.M. Carling D. Hardie D.G. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1994; 219: 751-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), Hardie's group recently reported that the activity of a more purified AMPKK is not affected by AMP (26Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28-28.16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, unlike AMPK, AMPKK is not regulated by AMP.Recently, the protein kinase LKB1 was identified as an AMPKK (26Hawley S.A. Boudeau J. Reid J.L. Mustard K.J. Udd L. Makela T.P. Alessi D.R. Hardie D.G. J. Biol. 2003; 2: 28-28.16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that other AMPKK isoforms may also exist. First, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae three distinct protein kinases have been identified as activators of the AMPK orthologue, Snf1 (27Hong S.P. Leiper F.C. Woods A. Carling D. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8839-8843Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 29Sutherland C.M. Hawley S.A. McCartney R.R. Leech A. Stark M.J. Schmidt M.C. Hardie D.G. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1299-1305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Second, in LKB1-deficient cells, the activity of AMPK is mildly reduced, whereas the activities of other LKB1-regulated kinases are nearly abolished (30Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Additionally, the activity of LKB1 is not affected by stimuli that activate AMPK (28Woods A. Johnstone S.R. Dickerson K. Leiper F.C. Fryer L.G. Neumann D. Schlattner U. Wallimann T. Carlson M. Carling D. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 2004-2008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar, 31Sakamoto K. Goransson O. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 287: E310-E317Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas the activity of AMPKK has been found to increase concurrently with AMPK following exercise (32Chen Z.P. Stephens T.J. Murthy S. Canny B.J. Hargreaves M. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. McConell G.K. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 2205-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar).Because AMPK is an important mediator of the metabolic sequelae that arise during and following myocardial ischemia, we determined whether ischemia stimulates AMPK via AMPKK and/or LKB1. In addition, we investigated whether positive allosterism is required for the stimulation of AMPK by ischemia.MATERIALS AND METHODSHeart Perfusions—All of the animals used in this study were cared for in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Canadian Council on Animal Care.Hearts from male Sprague-Dawley rats (300–350 g) were isolated and perfused as working preparations, as described previously (5Liu B. Clanachan A.S. Schulz R. Lopaschuk G.D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 33Finegan B.A. Clanachan A.S. Coulson C.S. Lopaschuk G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H1501-H1507PubMed Google Scholar). In one series of perfusions, hearts were subjected to either 60 min of aerobic perfusion or 30 min of aerobic perfusion followed by 30 min of global severe ischemia. The left atrial inflow line and the aortic outflow line were clamped to produce a global severe ischemia (5Liu B. Clanachan A.S. Schulz R. Lopaschuk G.D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 940-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Isolated working hearts were perfused with a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution that contained 2.5 mm Ca2+, 100 microunits/ml insulin, 11 mm glucose, and 1.2 mm palmitate bound to 3% bovine serum albumin (fraction V, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In a second series of perfusions, hearts were subjected to either 60 min of aerobic perfusion or 30 min of aerobic perfusion followed by 30 min of mild ischemia. The one-way ball valve technique (34Neely J.R. Rovetto M. Whitmer J. Morgan H. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) was modified to produce a controlled sustained mildischemia. The one-way ball valve was situated in one tract of a bifurcated aortic outflow line and was designed to not impede systolic ejection (34Neely J.R. Rovetto M. Whitmer J. Morgan H. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 225: 651-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). A backflow controller was placed in the second tract of the aortic outflow line to permit a proportion of ejected perfusate to bypass the one-way ball valve and perfuse the coronary circulation during diastole in a controlled manner. The perfusate was a modified Krebs-Henseleit solution that contained 2.5 mm Ca2+, 100 microunits/ml insulin, 5.5 mm d-[5-3H]glucose, and 1.2 mm palmitate bound to 3% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin (Sigma). As described previously, rates of glycolysis and palmitate oxidation were determined by measuring the rate of production of 3H2O and 14CO2, respectively (35Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the end of the perfusions, all hearts were quickly frozen with Wollenberger clamps cooled to the temperature of liquid N2.High Energy Phosphate Measurements—The tissue contents of AMP, ATP, Cr, and PCr were determined in neutralized perchloric acid extracts of frozen ventricular tissue by high performance liquid chromatography, as described previously (35Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8162-8170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Ally A. Park G. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 575: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).Tissue Extractions—Heart tissue was homogenized in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8 at 4 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Brij-35, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), protease inhibitors (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). The homogenate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was adjusted to contain 120 mm NaCl and 5% (w/v) PEG6000, mixed for 1 h, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The activities of AMPKK and AMPK were determined from the 5% PEG6000 supernatant and cleared homogenate, respectively. Protein concentrations of the cleared homogenate and 5% PEG6000 supernatant were determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213462) Google Scholar).Immunoblotting—Equal amounts of cleared homogenate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed first with an anti-AMPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), an anti-phosphoThr-172 AMPK antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), an anti-phosphoSer-79 ACC antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), or an anti-LKB1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), and then probed with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunoblots for ACC were conducted using horseradish peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories). Blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Detected immunocomplexes were scanned using a calibrated densitometer (Bio-Rad) and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad).Recombinant Protein Expression and Purification—The C-terminal truncation mutant of the AMPK α1 subunit encoding amino acids 1–312 (α312) was amplified from the full-length rat α1 cDNA (a gift from Dr. D. Carling, Imperial College of London) by the polymerase chain reaction. The sense and antisense primers used were: 5′-GTCGTACCATGGCCGAGAAGCAGAGCACGA-3′ and 5′-CACTAGCTCGAGGTACAGGCAGCTGAGGA-3′, respectively. The amplicon was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and then subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET30a using the restriction sites NcoI and XhoI. The resulting construct (α312-pET30a) encodes α312 with an S tag and His6 tag at the N terminus and a His6 tag at the C terminus.The Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with the α312-pET30a construct. Cells were grown to the mid-log phase and were then induced to express α312 by incubating the cells for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cells were lysed by freeze thawing and sonication in 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8 at 4 °C), 500 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.02% Brij-35, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml lysozyme (Sigma), and protease inhibitors (Sigma). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min, adjusted to pH 8 at 4 °C, and then filtered through a 0.45-μm filter.Recombinant α312 was purified using a Biologic HR chromatography system (Bio-Rad). All of the purification procedures were conducted at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was loaded onto a Ni2+ chelating Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences) that was equilibrated in buffer A (50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 8 at 4 °C), 10% w/v glycerol, 0.02% Brij-35, and 500 mm NaCl). The column was washed with 5 column volumes of buffer A, and α312 was eluted using a step gradient of imidazole. Fractions that contained purified α312 were pooled and exchanged into buffer B (50 mm Tris (pH 8 at 4 °C), 100 mm NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) by dialysis. Purified α312 was concentrated by centrifugation using Amicon Ultra (Millipore) centrifugal filters with a molecular mass cutoff of 10 kDa. Protease inhibitors (Sigma) and 1 mm DTT were added to the purified α312, which was then stored in aliquots at -80 °C. In this study, α312 was thawed immediately prior to use in the AMPKK assay.AMPK Assay—AMPK activity was assayed in homogenates as described previously (6Kudo N. Barr A.J. Barr R.L. Desai S. Lopaschuk G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17513-17520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), except the synthetic AMARA peptide (AMARAASAAALARRR) (38Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) was used as the substrate.AMPKK Assay—AMPKK activity was determined by measuring the activation of α312. Kinase buffer A contained 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35, 1 mm DTT, 100 μm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, a mixture of serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma), a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 5 μg α312, unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were initiated by the addition of sample (3 μg) that was incubated in kinase buffer A with or without α312, for 30 min or for the times indicated. The reactions were then adjusted to contain 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) Brij-35, 1 mm DTT, 200 μm ATP, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, a serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Sigma), a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 200 μm AMARA peptide. The reactions were further incubated for 10 min at 30 °C and subsequently terminated by the addition of H3PO4 (1% v/v, final concentration). An aliquot of each reaction was spotted into a well of a Unifilter P81 (Whatman) 96-well filterplate. Each well was washed 10 times with 300 μl of 1% (v/v) H3PO4 and twice with methanol. The filterplate was air dried, and 50 μl of MicroScint PS scintillant (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each well. Each well of the filterplate was counted in a MicroBeta Trilux (Wallac) scintillation counter.AMPKK activity was also directly determined by measuring the phosphorylation of Thr-172 within α312. Samples were incubated in kinase buffer A for 60 min, and the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Reactions were subsequently boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were then immunoblotted for phosphoThr-172, as described above.Immunoprecipitations—The ability of the goat anti-LKB1 antibody (M-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to immunoprecipitate LKB1 was tested by incubating 0, 150, or 300 μg of cleared homogenate with 1 μg of antibody, which was prebound to the wells of a protein A/G-coated eight-well strip (Pierce). The strips were incubated with gentle shaking for 4 h at 4 °C. Wells were then washed four times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8 at 4 °C), 1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.02% (v/v) Brij-35, 150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors (Sigma), and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). After the last wash, the immunoprecipitate and supernatant were resuspended in protein sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. Samples were boiled, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were probed first with a rabbit anti-LKB1 antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies) and then probed with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody that was preabsorbed to goat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Immunocomplexes were detected as described above.All subsequent immunoprecipitations were conducted, as described above, except LKB1 was immunoprecipitated from 0 or 150 μg of cleared homogenate and 1 mm DTT was included in the wash buffer. In addition, after the last wash the immunoprecipitate was immediately assayed for AMPKK activity by the aforementioned methods.RESULTSCardiac Function and High Energy Phosphates in Severely Ischemic Hearts—Hearts were perfused either for 60 min aerobically or for 30 min aerobically followed by 30 min of severe ischemia. As expected, cardiac work ceased in hearts subjected to severe ischemia (62 ± 4 and 0 mm Hg·ml·min-1·10-2, in aerobic and ischemic hearts, respectively). In addition to a depression in cardiac function, 30 min of severe ischemia caused a perturbation in the cellular levels of high energy phosphates that reflected an increase in the ratios of AMP:ATP and Cr:PCr (Table I).Table ISevere ischemia increases the AMP:ATP and Cr:PCr ratios High energy phosphates were measured at the end of 60 min of aerobic perfusion (n = 6) or at the end of a 30-min severe ischemic period (n = 6).

During severe ischemia it is not possible to measure the rate of fatty acid oxidation as a downstream marker of AMPK activity; thus, we determined whether the increased activity of AMPK was associated with an increase in ACC phosphorylation. As expected, a significant increase in the phosphorylation of ACC at Ser-79 was observed in severely ischemic hearts as compared with aerobic hearts (Fig. 1B). The total abundance of ACC protein was similar between aerobic and severely ischemic hearts (0.80 ± 0.03 and 0.89 ± 0.05 arbitrary units, respectively).Phosphorylation State of AMPK Thr-172 following Severe Ischemia—An important mechanism that governs the catalytic activity of AMPK is the phosphorylation of the key residue, Thr-172 (23Stein S.C.

Here we report on the purification, characterization, and cDNA cloning of a novel UGAT involved in the biosynthesis of flower pigments in the red daisy (Bellis perennis). The purified enzyme, BpUGAT, was a soluble monomeric enzyme with a molecular mass of 54 kDa and catalyzed the regiospecific transfer of a glucuronosyl unit from UDP-glucuronate to the 2″-hydroxyl group of the 3-glucosyl moiety of cyanidin 3-O-6″-O-malonylglucoside with a kcat value of 34 s–1 at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. BpUGAT was highlyspecific for cyanidin 3-O-glucosides (e.g. Km for cyanidin 3-O-6″-O-malonylglucoside, 19 μm) and UDP-glucuronate (Km, 476 μm). The BpUGAT cDNA was isolated on the basis of the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that transcripts of BpUGAT could be specifically detected in red petals, consistent with the temporal and spatial distributions of enzyme activity in the plant and also consistent with the role of the enzyme in pigment biosynthesis. A sequence analysis revealed that BpUGAT is related to the glycosyltransferase 1 (GT1) family of the glycosyltransferase superfamily (according to the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) data base). Among GT1 family members that encompass vertebrate UGATs and plant secondary product glycosyltransferases, the highest sequence similarity was found with flavonoid rhamnosyltransferases of plants (28–40% identity). Although the biological role (pigment biosynthesis) and enzymatic properties of BpUGAT are significantly different from those of vertebrate UGATs, both of these UGATs share a similarity in that the products produced by these enzymes are more water-soluble, thus facilitating their accumulation in vacuoles (in BpUGAT) or their excretion from cells (in vertebrate UGATs), corroborating the proposed general significance of GT1 family members in the metabolism of small lipophilic molecules.

The known UGATs have all been shown to be members of the glycosyltransferase superfamily. This superfamily is subclassified, based on their phylogenetics, into 74 families (GT1–GT75; according to the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes (CAZy) data base (1Campbell J.A. Davies G.J. Bulone V. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 929-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar); afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/index.html) where UGAT activities have been identified in four separate families (GT1, GT43, GT47, and GT70). In vertebrates, UGATs are expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells of the liver and other organs and are involved in the glucuronide conjugation of xenobiotics (e.g. drugs and dietary phytoalexins) and endobiotics (e.g. bilirubin and steroid hormones) (2Brierley C.H. Burchell B. BioEssays. 1993; 15: 749-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 3Bock K.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 691-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These UGATs confer water solubility on these lipophilic compounds and facilitate their excretion from cells, thus playing a very important role in their detoxification and elimination. Extensive biochemical and genetic studies of these UGATs have shown that they are metal-activated, membrane-bound, oligomeric enzymes and are related to the GT1 family of the superfamily (4Radominska-Pandya A. Czernik P.J. Little J.M. Battaglia E. Mackenzie P.I. Drug Metab. Rev. 1999; 31: 817-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 5Lim E-K. Bowles D.J. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In animals, another type of UGAT, galactosylgalactosylxylosylprotein 3-β-UGATs, a family GT43 enzyme, is involved in the biosynthesis of proteoglycans (6Shimoda Y. Tajima Y. Nagase T. Harii K.

Commun. 1999; 255: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In plants, UGATs or UGAT-related genes have been proposed to play important roles in growth and metabolism, and these roles appear to be distinct from those of the animal enzymes mentioned above. For example, a UGAT-like gene (NpGUT1), belonging to the GT47 family of the superfamily, presumably codes for pectin UGAT, which is involved in pectin biosynthesis. Genetic investigations indicate that this enzyme is essential for intercellular attachment in meristems of Nicotiana plumbaginifolia (8Iwai H. Masaoka N. Ishii T. Satoh S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16319-16324Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). A gene (PsUGT1) showing a sequence similarity to human UGAT has also been identified in Pisum sativum through genetic approaches and has been reported to be essential for normal plant growth and development (9Woo H-H. Orbach M.J. Hirsch A.M. Hawes M.C. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2303-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, the specificity, catalytic properties, and biochemical properties of these UGAT-like proteins remain to be clarified. UGATs are also involved in plant secondary metabolism of biomedical and agricultural relevance, such as the biosynthesis of baicalin (5,6-dihydroxy-7-O-glucuronosylflavone), a major flavonoid of the dried roots of Scutellaria baicalensis, that shows antiallergic, anti-HIV, and antitumor activities (10Nagashima S. Hirotani M. Yoshikawa T. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Some of these UGATs (11Schulz M. Weissenbock G. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 1261-1267Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 12Kurosawa Y. Takahara H. Shiraiwa M. Planta. 2002; 215: 620-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), including UDP-glucuronate:baicalein 7-UGAT (UBGAT) of S. baicalensis (10Nagashima S. Hirotani M. Yoshikawa T. Phytochemistry. 2000; 53: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), have been purified and characterized. However, the genetic aspects of these UGATs have yet to be studied, although the primary structure of UBGAT has recently been submitted to data bases (GenBank™/DDBJ/EBI accession number BAC98300). To further enhance our knowledge of the enzymology, phylogenetics, and physiological importance of plant UGATs and shed light on structure/function relationship of these enzymes, we initiated a study of UGATs that are involved in the biosynthesis of cyanidin 3-O-2″-O-β-glucuronosyl-6″-O-malonylglucoside, an anthocyanin responsible for the red coloration of daisy (Bellis perennis) flowers (13Saito N. Toki K. Honda T. Kawase K. Phytochemistry. 1988; 27: 2963-2966Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 14Toki K. Saito N. Honda T. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 3769-3771Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is generally thought that the glucuronosylation of anthocyanin should enhance its solubility and the stability of the pigment and is important in maintaining the coloration and hues of the flowers (14Toki K. Saito N. Honda T. Phytochemistry. 1991; 30: 3769-3771Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 15Brouillard R. Dangles O. Harbone J.B. The Flavonoids. Chapman & Hall/CRC, Washington, D.

We describe here the isolation, gene cloning, and functional characterization of a novel enzyme, UDP-glucuronic acid:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside 2″-O-β-glucuronosyltransferase, which we hereafter refer to as BpUGAT. Red daisy (B. perennis; Sakata, Yokohama, Japan) was purchased from a local market in Sendai, Japan, and used throughout this study. Recently opened flowers (less than 15 mm in diameter) were collected and stored at –80 °C until used. Anthocyanins were isolated and purified at Minami-Kyushu University, Miyazaki, Japan, and were used as authentic samples after confirmation of their structures by instrumental analyses. UDP-glucuronate (trisodium salt), isoflavones, flavonols, and p-nitrophenyl β-d-glucoside were purchased from Sigma. CHAPS, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and polyvinylpolypyrrolidone were products of Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan. The standard reaction mixture (final volume, 100 μl) consisted of 20 mm potassium phosphate (Pi), pH 7.0, 120 μm anthocyanin substrate, 774 μm UDP-glucuronate (final concentrations), and the enzyme. For routine assays, cyanidin 3-O-6″-O-malonylglucoside (Cy3MG) was used as an anthocyanin substrate. The mixture, in the absence of enzyme, was preincubated at 30 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme. After incubation at 30 °C for 10 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 μl of ice-cold 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Anthocyanins in the reaction mixture were routinely analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Shodex Asahipak ODP-50 4E column (4.6 mm × 250 mm) using a Rainin Dynamax HPLC system (Rainin Instruments Co., Woburn, MA), as described previously (17Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Fukui Y. Nakamura N. Nakao M. Tanaka Y. Yamaguchi M-A. Kusumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49013-49019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Kinetic parameters and their standard errors were estimated by fitting the initial velocity data to the Michaelis-Menten equation by means of a non-linear regression analysis (18Leatherbarrow R.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 455-458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Protein was quantified by the method of Bradford (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using a kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. All operations were performed at 0–4 °C. Step 1: Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation and Polyethyleneimine Treatment—Recently opened red flowers (0.5 kg) of B. perennis were suspended in 2,000 ml of an extraction buffer (100 mm potassium Pi containing 0.2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 9% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and were disrupted for 30 s in a Waring blender followed by centrifugation at 8,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was further filtered through Whatman 114 filter paper. A total of 1.5 kg of red daisy flowers was treated in the same manner as above to give a total of 7,000 ml of crude extract, which was then subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The precipitate of the 30–70% saturation fraction was dissolved in 2,500 ml of extraction buffer. Polyethyleneimine was then added to the enzyme solution to a final concentration of 0.3% (w/v). After stirring the mixture for 10 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant solution was extensively dialyzed against 40 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Step 2: First Q Sepharose—The enzyme solution was applied to a column (5 × 20 cm) of Q Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 40 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. After washing the column with the equilibration buffer, the enzyme was eluted with 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. The active fractions were dialyzed against 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. Step 3: Second Q Sepharose—The enzyme solution (1,900 ml) was applied to a column (2 × 20 cm) of Q Sepharose Fast Flow equilibrated with 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. After washing the column with the equilibration buffer, the enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient (20–200 mm) of potassium Pi, pH 7.5, in the buffer (total gradient volume, 1,000 ml). The active fractions were combined and concentrated on an Amicon 8200 ultrafiltration unit. Ammonium sulfate was added to the enzyme solution to a final concentration of 20% of saturation. Step 4: Phenyl-Sepharose—The enzyme solution (37.5 ml) was applied to an HR10/16 column (Amersham Biosciences) packed with phenyl-Sepharose 6 FF (low sub) (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing ammonium sulfate at 20% saturation and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. The column was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through fractions, containing enzyme activity, were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, dialyzed against 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and concentrated by ultrafiltration. Step 5: CHT Ceramic Hydroxyapatite—The enzyme solution (10 ml) was applied to an HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) packed with CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite (Type I, Bio-Rad) equilibrated with 5 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme activity was eluted by increasing the potassium Pi concentration of the buffer from 10–100 mm in 10 mm steps (50 ml for each step). The active fractions were collected, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and dialyzed against 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS. Step 6: Mono Q Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography—The enzyme solution (23 ml) was applied to a Mono Q HR10/10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the above buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min using a fast protein liquid chromatography system. The column was washed with the same buffer (50 ml). The enzyme activity was eluted with a linear gradient of potassium Pi (20–300 mm in 350 min) in the buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The active fractions were collected and concentrated by Centricon YM10 ultrafiltration. Step 7: Superdex 200 Gel Filtration—The enzyme solution (2.5 ml) was applied to a column of HiLoad 26/60 Superdex, 200 pg (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, and 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol and eluted at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. The active fractions were collected and concentrated by using a Centricon YM10 ultrafiltration device. Step 8: RESOURCE PHE—The enzyme solution (3 ml) was applied to a RESOURCE PHE column (6 ml, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing ammonium sulfate at 20% saturation, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% CHAPS. The column was washed with the same buffer. The flow-through fractions, containing enzyme activity, were collected and concentrated using a Centricon YM10. A homogeneous preparation of BpUGAT was obtained at this step. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gels were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250. For sugar staining of protein bands, proteins in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The glycoprotein blots were visualized by methods reported previously (21Bayer E.A. Ben-Hur H. Wilchek M. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Kondo M. Harada H. Sunada S. Yamaguchi T. Electrophoresis. 1991; 12: 685-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) using a kit (G. P. Sensor, Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) following the manufacturer's recommendations. To obtain internal amino acid sequences of BpUGAT purified from red daisy flowers, purified protein was digested with a lysylendopeptidase from Achromobacter lyticus M497-1 (Wako, Tokyo, Japan), and the resulting peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC as described previously (23Fujiwara H. Tanaka Y. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Nakao M. Fukui Y. Yamaguchi M-A. Ashikari T. Kusumi T. Plant J. 1998; 16: 421-431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Nakayama T. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Sato T. Kikuchi S. Fukui Y. Fukuchi-Mizutani M. Ueda T. Nakao M. Tanaka Y. Kusumi T. Nishino T. Science. 2000; 290: 1163-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences of some of these peptides were determined by automated Edman degradation: Ser-Gly-Pro-Asp-Phe-Glu-Thr-Ile-Leu-Ile-Lys (termed sequence 1), Arg-Glu-Glu-Ile-Ala-Ala-Val-Val-Arg-Lys (sequence 2), and Asn-Met-Glu-Ala-Glu-Val-Asp-Gly-Ile-Val (sequence 3). Based on the amino acid sequences determined as above, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were synthesized: primer F1 (5′-GGICCIGAYTTYGARACIATHTTRATHAAR-3′, based on sequence 1; see above), primer R1 (5′-ARRTTYTCDATIACDATICCRTCIACYTC-3′, based on sequence 3), and primer R2 (5′-CCRTCIACYTCIFCYTCCATRTT-3′, based on sequence 3) where I indicates inosine and R, H, D, and Y indicate degenerate sites: R, A/G; H, A/C/T; D, A/G/T; and Y, C/T. Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from the B. perennis flowers by using a kit (Straight A's mRNA isolation system, Novagen, Madison, WI). The reverse transcription-PCR was performed using a Qiagen One-Step reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with the primers F1 and R1 and poly(A)+ RNA. The nested PCR was completed using the amplified fragment as a template and primers F1 and R2. The amplified fragment, UGT1, which was ∼1 kbp in length, was digoxigenin-labeled using the PCR digoxigenin probe synthesis kit (Roche Diagnostics). A cDNA library of B. perennis flowers was constructed using a ZAP Express cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) following the manufacturer's guidelines. With the digoxigenin-labeled fragment as a probe, the cDNA library of B. perennis flowers, ∼400,000 plaques, was screened as described previously (17Suzuki H. Nakayama T. Yonekura-Sakakibara K. Fukui Y. Nakamura N. Nakao M. Tanaka Y. Yamaguchi M-A. Kusumi T. Nishino T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49013-49019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The cDNA of positive clones was subcloned into the pBluescript SK(–) phagemid vector (Stratagene) and subjected to DNA sequencing using a dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Beckman Coulter) with a CEQ 2000XL DNA analysis system (Beckman Coulter). The full-length BpUGAT cDNA was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CTCGAGATGGATTCAAAAATCG-3′ and 5′-GGTACCTTAATTATTCATTTCAC-3′ to introduce XhoI and KpnI sites containing the translation initiation and stop codons into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the cDNA, respectively. The amplified fragment was cloned into a pCR4Blunt-TOPO vector using a kit (Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit for sequencing, Invitrogen) to confirm the absence of PCR errors. The plasmid was digested with XhoI and KpnI, and the resulting ∼1.4-kbp DNA fragment was ligated with a pESC-TRP vector (Stratagene) that had previously been digested with XhoI and KpnI to give the plasmid pESC-TRP-BpUGAT, which encodes BpUGAT. Saccharomyces cerevisiae YPH499 was used as a host for the expression of BpUGAT. Transformed cells were cultivated at 30 °C in 600 ml of an SG Trp dropout medium (Stratagene) with shaking for 7–10 days until the A600 reached 1.5. Cells were harvested by centrifugation. All subsequent operations were carried out at 0–4 °C. Cells (12.6 g, wet weight) were suspended in 26 ml of 100 mm potassium Pi, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% (w/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and were disrupted with glass beads (0.5 mm) by using a Multibeads Shocker Model MBS200 (Yasui Co., Osaka, Japan) followed by centrifugation. Polyethyleneimine was then added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 0.3% (w/v). After stirring the mixture for 10 min, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation. Purification of the recombinant BpUGT was carried out essentially as described above. Total RNA was prepared from the individual organs of a B. perennis plant using the RNeasy plant minikit (Qiagen). The BpUGAT transcript in 200 ng of total RNA from the individual organs was quantified by quantitative real time PCR with the BpUGAT-specific primers (5′-GGATGCTCATCTCTACAC-3′ and 5′-GACCTTCTCATGCAATCAAC-3′). Real time PCR was carried out using the LightCycler Quick System Model 330 (Roche Diagnostics) and the QuantiTect SYBR Green reverse transcription-PCR kit (Qiagen). Thermal cycling conditions were 50 °C for 20 min and then 95 °C for 15 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 10 s. A plasmid encoding the full-length BpUGAT cDNA was used as a template for the calibration. The developmental stages of daisy flowers are defined as follows: stage 1, 5–7 mm in diameter (no pigmentation); stage 2, 7–10 mm (slightly pigmented); stage 3, 10 mm (fully pigmented); stage 4, 10–15 mm (fully pigmented); stage 5, >15 mm (fully pigmented). Preliminary studies showed that BpUGAT was a soluble enzyme, and a high specific activity was found in recently opened flowers (less than 15 mm in diameter); thus, a large amount of such flowers (1.5 kg, fresh weight) was used as the starting material for purifying the enzyme. Moreover the enzyme appeared to be susceptible to sulfhydryl oxidation, and the addition of 2-mercaptoethanol to the buffer was essential for purifying the enzyme efficiently. The elution profiles of UGAT activity during chromatographies on CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite, Mono Q, and Superdex 200 strictly coincided with those of a 54-kDa protein (Fig. 1), strongly suggesting that this 54-kDa protein was responsible for the UGAT activity. Finally the enzyme could be purified 540-fold to homogeneity (Fig. 1) with an activity yield of 2.1% after eight purification steps (Table I). The BpUGAT band in the SDS-polyacrylamide gels was negative for sugar staining (not shown), strongly suggesting the absence of sugar chains on the enzyme. The native molecular mass of the purified BpUGAT was estimated to be 49 kDa by gel filtration chromatography on Superdex 200, indicating that the enzyme was monomeric.Fig. 1SDS-PAGE of purified BpUGAT. The enzyme preparations (lane 1, native enzyme purified from B. perennis flowers; lane 2, recombinant enzyme purified from S. cerevisiae transformant cells) and marker proteins (lane 3) were simultaneously electrophoresed under the conditions of Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IPurification of BpUGAT from red daisy flowersStepTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymgnanokatalspicokatals/mg protein-fold%Crude extract5,25047.09.01100Ammonium sulfate (Step 1)2,90035.0121.475Q Sepharose (Step 2)53021.4403.846Q Sepharose (Step 3)44019.7475.242Phenyl-Sepharose (Step 4)1176.9596.615Ceramic hydroxyapatite (Step 5)11.57.86807616Mono Q HR10/10 (Step 6)4.36.51,50016814Superdex 200 (Step 7)0.662.23,3003724.6RESOURCE PHE (Step 8)0.210.994,8005402.1 Open table in a new tab Reaction of the purified BpUGAT with Cy3MG yielded a single product, which co-eluted with the major anthocyanin of red daisy flowers, as evidenced by analytical reversed-phase HPLC (not shown). By positive mode time-of-flight mass spectrometry, the product showed a molecular ion at m/z 711 [M]+, and the time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry of m/z 711 showed a fragment ion peak at m/z 535 [M–176]+. These results suggest the presence of a glucuronosyl moiety in the product molecule. NMR analyses of the product revealed that it was cyanidin 3-O-β-2″-O-β-glucuronosyl-6″-O-malonylglucopyranoside (Refs. 13Saito N. Toki K. Honda T. Kawase K.

Thus, the purified enzyme catalyzes the regiospecific transfer of the glucuronosyl group with inversion of its anomeric configuration to the 2″-hydroxyl group of the 3-glucosyl moiety of the substrate anthocyanin (Scheme I) and is defined as a UDP-glucuronic acid:anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside 2″-O-β-glucuronosyltransferase. The calculated kcat value for the BpUGAT-catalyzed glucuronosyl transfer from UDP-glucuronate to Cy3MG was 34 ± 7s–1, and the Km values for Cy3MG and UDP-glucuronate were 19 ± 7 and 476 ± 101 μm, respectively (Table II).

The inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are believed to bind to the N-terminal IAP binding motifs of the mature (proteolytically processed) forms of Smac, HtrA2, and caspase-9. However, we show here that BRUCE/Apollon, a 528-kDa IAP whose degradation promotes apoptosis, associates with their precursors as well as the mature forms by binding to regions in addition to the IAP binding motif. Through these associations, BRUCE promotes the degradation of Smac and inhibits the activity of caspase-9 but not the effector caspase, caspase-3. In response to apoptotic stimuli, BRUCE is degraded by proteasomes and/or cleaved by caspases and HtrA2 depending on the specific stimulus and the cell type. These results suggest that the ability of BRUCE to antagonize both the precursor and mature forms of Smac and caspase-9 is an important mechanism for the prevention of apoptosis under normal conditions.

These results suggest that the ability of BRUCE to antagonize both the precursor and mature forms of Smac and caspase-9 is an important mechanism for the prevention of apoptosis under normal conditions. In response to apoptotic stimuli, caspases are activated to initiate irreversible proteolytic cascades that result in the destruction of key cellular components and rapid cell death (1Cryns V. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). Activation of these cascades can be triggered by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (3Budihardjo I. Oliver H. Lutter M. Luo X. Wang X. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 269-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2269) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c then binds to Apaf-1 and activates the initiator caspase-9, which cleaves and activates the effector caspases, such as caspases-3 and -7. The activity of caspases can be inhibited by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) 1The abbreviations used are: IAP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein; AMC, amino-4-methylcoumarin; BIR, baculoviral IAP repeat; CPT, camptothecin; Ub, ubiquitin; RNAi, RNA interference; dBRUCE, the Drosophila homolog of BRUCE; BRUCE-C, C-terminal region of BRUCE (residues 4412–4829); siRNA, small interfering RNA; GFP, green fluorescent protein; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; TNFα, tumor necrosis factor-α; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein ligase; XIAP, the X-linked IAP; BD, Boc-ASP. family of proteins, which are defined by the presence of one to three tandem baculoviral IAP repeats (BIRs) (3Budihardjo I.

On the other hand, the actions of IAP proteins are opposed by certain pro-apoptotic factors, especially Smac/DIABLO and HtrA2/Omi. These proteins contain the specific IAP binding motifs at their N termini. Smac and HtrA2 are synthesized as larger cytosolic precursors that are proteolytically processed in mitochondria to expose their IAP binding motifs. In response to apoptotic stimuli, the processed Smac and HtrA2 are released into the cytosol where they interact with the IAPs (5Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X.

Smac and the Drosophila pro-apoptotic proteins, Hid, Rpr, and Grim, which also contain the IAP binding motifs, inhibit IAPs by tight binding, but HtrA2 is a serine protease that cleaves and inactivates certain IAPs (4Salvesen G.S. Duckett C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). In addition to inhibiting caspase activities, several IAPs have been shown to promote proteasomal degradation of proteins by catalyzing ubiquitination. Ubiquitination involves the sequential actions of the ubiquitin (Ub)-activating enzyme (E1), a Ub-carrier protein (E2), and a Ub-protein ligase (E3), which binds the substrate and catalyzes the transfer of the activated Ub from a specific E2 to the substrate (8Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6906) Google Scholar). Most IAPs, including c-IAP1, c-IAP2, XIAP, and Drosophila IAP1, contain a RING-finger domain, a characteristic feature of a large family of E3s (9Joazeiro C.A. Weissman A.M. Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). In certain cells, these IAPs catalyze their own ubiquitination and degradation as well as degradation of other proteins important for apoptosis, including mature Smac/DIABLO, active caspase-3, and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (10Hu S. Yang X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10055-10060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 11Li X. Yang Y. Ashwell J.D.

A. 2001; 98: 8662-8667Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). BRUCE/Apollon is an IAP with several unusual properties. It is a very large (528 kDa) membrane-associated protein and contains one BIR domain (15Chen Z. Naito M. Hori S. Mashima T. Yamori T. Tsuruo T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 847-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 16Hauser H.P. Bardroff M. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike other IAPs, BRUCE contains a C-terminal E2 motif (16Hauser H.P. Bardroff M. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). BRUCE itself is regulated by ubiquitin-dependent degradation that is mediated by the E2 UbcH5 and the E3 Nrdp1, which together also ubiquitinate the epidermal growth factor receptor family member, ErbB3 (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 18Qiu X.B. Goldberg A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14843-14848Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Decreasing BRUCE content by overexpression of Nrdp1 or by RNA interference (RNAi) induces apoptosis in several cell lines (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that BRUCE, unlike other mammalian IAPs, is essential to inhibit apoptosis in certain cell types. In Drosophila, overexpression of dBRUCE (the Drosophila homolog of BRUCE) suppresses cell death induced by Rpr and Grim (19Vernooy S.Y. Chow V. Su J. Verbrugghe K. Yang J. Cole S. Olson M.R. Hay B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1164-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The E2 domain in dBRUCE is required for this suppression, suggesting that dBRUCE can inhibit apoptosis by promoting ubiquitination (19Vernooy S.Y. Chow V. Su J. Verbrugghe K. Yang J. Cole S. Olson M.R. Hay B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1164-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, during sperm differentiation, dBRUCE is suggested to protect the nucleus from excessive caspase activity and degeneration (20Arama E. Agapite J. Steller H. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 687-697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this paper, Hao et al. (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) reported that BRUCE is essential to inhibit Smac-induced apoptosis by promoting ubiquitination and degradation of the mature Smac. We present complementary evidence that BRUCE promotes degradation of mature Smac. However, we demonstrate that BRUCE, unlike other IAPs, also binds to the precursor of Smac and promotes its degradation. Furthermore, we show that BRUCE binds to pro-caspase-9 and inhibits its cleavage. Pro-caspase-9 in complex with Apaf-1 plays a key role in the initiation of the caspase cascades and is resistant to other IAPs (22Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Therefore, the interaction of BRUCE with pro-caspase-9 is likely to be particularly important in inhibiting apoptosis. In addition, we show that BRUCE can inhibit the activity of mature caspase-9 but not caspase-3. BRUCE is the only essential IAP in mammals (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The exceptional ability of BRUCE to antagonize the precursors of Smac and caspase-9, whose ectopic expression promotes apoptosis (5Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 23Duan H. Orth K. Chinnaiyan A.M. Poirier G.G. Froelich C.J. He W.W. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16720-16724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar), might account for this essentiality of BRUCE. Cell Culture and Transfections—293T adenovirus-transformed human embryo kidney cells, HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cells, and HeLa human epitheloid carcinoma cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (CellGro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics in 5% CO2. All of the cell lines and serum were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Transfection was carried out using a Trans-IT transfection kit (Mirus). Expression Vectors—The C-terminal region of BRUCE (residues 4412–4829, BRUCE-C), full-length Smac (residues 1–239), truncated Smac (Δ2–55), full-length HtrA2 (residues 1–458), and truncated HtrA2 (Δ2–133) with Myc-His6 tags at the C termini were subcloned into pcDNA6 (Invitrogen). The SmacV57A/P58A mutant was made according to standard procedures. The DNA vectors for siRNA expression, BS/U6/BRUCE, and BS/U6/GFP were obtained as described previously (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The plasmids with T7 promoters for pro-caspase-3 and pro-caspase-9 were kindly provided by Dr. Junying Yuan. The sequences of all of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Co-immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were extracted and immunoprecipitated in buffer A containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). To purify BRUCE or XIAP, immunoprecipitation was carried out in a high stringency buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm ZnCl2, and the protease inhibitor mixture. Membranes carrying proteins from 14 mouse parenchymal tissues were purchased from RNWAY Laboratories Inc. (Seoul, Korea). Except where noted, the levels of proteins were analyzed by Western blot using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibodies against BRUCE and XIAP were purchased from BD Biosciences. Caspase-7, actin, and FLAG were from Sigma. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 were purchased from Cell Signaling Inc. Myc was from Oncogene, HtrA2 and caspase-9 were from R&D Systems, and Smac was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Caspase and HtrA2 Assays—To assay caspase activation, 293T cell extracts were prepared in buffer A (but without CHAPS and the protease inhibitor mixture) essentially as described (24Roy N. Deeveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6914-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). The activity of caspase-9 was analyzed in the buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% polyethylene glycol, and 20 μm Ac-LEHD-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC). The activity of caspase-3 was assayed using either Z-DEVD-7-AMC or 35S-labeled pro-casapse-9 as the substrate. The release of AMC from the substrates was monitored continuously at 380/460 nm (excitation/emission), and the cleavage of pro-casapse-9 was detected by PhosphorImager following SDS-PAGE. The cleavage of the immunopurified BRUCE by the purified recombinant caspases (obtained from BIOMOL) or HtrA2 (from R&D Systems) was assayed according to the manufacturer's instructions. BRUCE Associates with Both Precursor and Mature Forms of Smac—Overexpression of dBRUCE has been shown to suppress cell death induced by the Smac functional homologs, Rpr and Grim (19Vernooy S.Y. Chow V. Su J. Verbrugghe K. Yang J. Cole S. Olson M.R. Hay B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1164-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because mature Smac, through its IAP binding motif (the AVPI sequence), interacts with other IAPs, we examined whether mammalian BRUCE associates with Smac. BRUCE could be co-immunoprecipitated with an anti-Smac antibody (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the C-terminal region of BRUCE, which lacks the BIR domain, was not brought down by this antibody. When 293T cells were transfected with the full-length Smac containing a Myc tag at its C terminus, both BRUCE and XIAP could be co-immunoprecipitated from the lysates with an anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 1B). However, when these cells were transfected instead with a truncated Smac, which contains a methionine on its N-terminal IAP binding motif in place of its N-terminal sequence (Smac Δ2–55), XIAP was not co-immunoprecipitated with Smac Δ2–55 because this N-terminal methionine blocks the function of the IAP binding motif in Smac Δ2–55 (25Vucic D. Deshayes K. Ackerly H. Pisabarro M.T. Kadkhodayan S. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12275-12279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast, some of the BRUCE was reproducibly co-immunoprecipitated with Smac Δ2–55, although the amount of BRUCE precipitated was significantly smaller than when the full-length molecule was transfected (Fig. 1B). These findings suggest that XIAP and BRUCE bind Smac by distinct mechanisms (for further evidence, see below). When an antibody against BRUCE or XIAP was used for immunoprecipitation, the mature (proteolytically processed) Smac could be co-immunoprecipitated with either antibody (Fig. 1C). However, the full-length Smac precursor was also co-immunoprecipitated with BRUCE but not with XIAP (Fig. 1C). Because Smac can dimerize (26Chai J. Du C. Wu J.W. Kyin S. Wang X. Shi Y. Nature. 2000; 406: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), we tested whether the co-immunoprecipitation of the Smac precursor with BRUCE was due to dimerization of the precursor with the mature Smac. However, when the Smac precursor was generated by in vitro transcription and translation, in the absence of the mature Smac, BRUCE was still immunoprecipitated together with the Smac precursor (Fig. 1D and data not shown). Thus, unlike XIAP, BRUCE binds to not only the mature but also the precursor form of Smac. The N-terminal sequence of the Smac precursor appears to be important for this association with BRUCE, because the truncated Smac, Smac Δ2–55, which lacks the N-terminal sequence, was co-immunoprecipitated with BRUCE to a much lesser extent than the precursor (Fig. 1D). Region(s) in Mature Smac Besides the AVPI Sequence Can Bind to BRUCE—Because the N-terminal sequence of the precursor blocks the interaction of other IAPs with the AVPI sequence (5Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 25Vucic D. Deshayes K. Ackerly H. Pisabarro M.T. Kadkhodayan S. Fairbrother W.J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12275-12279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), the association of BRUCE with the Smac precursor must involve a distinct mechanism. To further examine whether the interaction of BRUCE with the mature Smac requires the AVPI sequence, we made a mutant Smac (V57A/P58A) that contains an AAAI stretch in place of the AVPI. When this mutant was transfected into 293T cells, both the precursor and the mature form were detectable by Western blot (Fig. 2A and data not shown) and, as expected, these mutations greatly reduced (by over 90%) the association with XIAP (compared with that of Smac containing the AVPI motif). However, an appreciable amount of BRUCE was still co-immunoprecipitated with this mutated mature Smac (in fact only 20% less BRUCE was precipitated than with the wild-type Smac, Fig. 2A). These findings indicate that Smac can associate with BRUCE through non-AVPI region(s). To confirm this surprising result, we tested whether the AVPI-containing peptide, AVPIA, could inhibit this interaction. When this peptide was present in the immunoprecipitation experiments, it blocked the association of Smac with XIAP but not that with BRUCE (Fig. 2B). In contrast, an irrelevant sequence MALLK (the N-terminal peptide of the Smac precursor) or NFEKL had no effect on the association of Smac with either XIAP or BRUCE. Thus, although the AVPI motif seems to contribute to the association of mature Smac with BRUCE, BRUCE also associates with both the mature Smac and its precursor through an AVPI-independent mechanism. Loss of BRUCE Reduces Degradation of Smac—In response to TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), Smac in MCF-7 cells is released from mitochondria and its level falls due to degradation by the proteasome (27MacFarlane M. Merrison W. Bratton S.B. Cohen G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36611-36616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). In HT1080 cells, the DNA-damaging agent, camptothecin (CPT), also reduced the levels of Smac (data not shown). To test whether BRUCE mediates this degradation of Smac, we attempted to decrease the levels of BRUCE in HT1080 cells. Transfection of the E3 Nrdp1, which catalyzes the degradation of BRUCE especially during the initiation of apoptosis (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), led to a marked reduction in the levels of BRUCE and a clear increase in the levels of Smac in the presence of CPT (Fig. 3A). This increase in Smac is probably due to the reduction in BRUCE, because the knockdown of BRUCE by RNAi also led to a marked increase in the levels of endogenous Smac (Fig. 3B). Similarly, the levels of HtrA2, another protein containing an IAP binding motif, also increased following the knockdown of BRUCE. In contrast, the levels of pro-caspase-9 did not increase under this condition (Fig. 3B). To confirm that BRUCE decreases the levels of Smac, 293T cells were transfected with the full-length Smac and with BRUCE-siRNA. As noted above, decreasing the levels of BRUCE by RNAi caused an increase in the levels of mature Smac in these cells (Fig. 3C). No Smac precursor was detected in this experiment, probably because only small amounts of the vector for Smac were used for transfection. Overexpression of Nrdp1, which reduced the levels of BRUCE, also increased the levels of mature Smac in the 293T cells (Fig. 3D). It is noteworthy that the overexpression of Nrdp1 did elevate the levels of the Smac precursor, perhaps because Nrdp1 reduced BRUCE content more than BRUCE-siRNA (Fig. 3D). To determine whether BRUCE reduces Smac by accelerating its degradation, we measured the stability of mature Smac by pulse-chase analysis. Both BRUCE-siRNA and Nrdp1 reduced the degradation of Smac (Fig. 3E). The half-life of Smac was less than 1 h in control cells, but it increased to more than 2 h in the cells transfected with BRUCE-siRNA or Nrdp1, indicating that BRUCE promotes Smac degradation. Because depletion of BRUCE by Nrdp1 caused accumulation of both the mature Smac and its precursor, it is possible that BRUCE controls the levels of Smac in normal cells. To investigate this possibility, we measured the relative levels of these proteins in various mouse tissues by Western blot. The relative amounts of BRUCE were found to be inversely correlated with the levels of Smac in the different tissues (n = 14, p < 0.05) (Fig. 3F). This inverse correlation implies that when the levels of BRUCE are high, the precursor (and probably also the mature form) of Smac is rapidly degraded. In contrast, although the knockdown of BRUCE also led to an increase in the levels of HtrA2 in HT1080 cells (Fig. 3B), no inverse correlation was found between the levels of HtrA2 and BRUCE in these mouse tissues (Fig. 3F and data not shown). BRUCE Associates with Both Pro-caspase-9 and Caspase-9 and Antagonizes Caspase-9 —Because caspase-9 also contains an IAP binding motif, we examined whether pro-caspase-9 may bind to BRUCE in a similar manner as the Smac precursor. Unexpectedly, no association between the endogenous pro-caspase-9 and full-length BRUCE was detected by co-immunoprecipitation. However, a 90-kDa fragment that reacted with the anti-BRUCE antibody was co-precipitated with pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 4A). Therefore, this failure to find full-length BRUCE in the immunoprecipitates may be due to its cleavage by pro-caspase-9 (see below). Accordingly, the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk to the cell lysates led to the detection of the proteins larger than 90 kDa that reacted with the anti-BRUCE antibody (Fig. 4A). To test more rigorously whether BRUCE associates with pro-caspase-9, we incubated the immunopurified BRUCE or XIAP with pro-caspase-9 synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation and found that pro-caspase-9 could be pulled down with an antibody against BRUCE but not an anti-XIAP antibody (Fig. 4B). Whereas the antibody against XIAP pulled down a small amount of pro-caspase-3, the anti-BRUCE antibody was much more effective (Fig. 4B). When mature caspase-9 or caspase-3 was incubated with immunopurified BRUCE or XIAP, an antibody against BRUCE pulled down caspase-9 but not caspase-3. In contrast, an antibody against XIAP co-immunoprecipitated with both caspase-3 and caspase-9 (Fig. 4C). Therefore, BRUCE binds in vitro to both pro-caspase-9 and caspase-9 but not caspase-3. Pro-caspase-9 is active in cleaving pro-caspase-3 when it forms a complex with Apaf-1 (22Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether the association of BRUCE with pro-caspase-9 also inhibits its activity in vivo. Unlike most of the other cell lines we tested (data not shown), HeLa cells have some detectable processed caspase-9 in the absence of apoptotic stimuli, probably due to auto-cleavage of pro-caspase-9 in these cells. Decreasing the content of BRUCE by RNAi and/or treatment with CPT reduced the levels of pro-caspase-9, probably because the lack of BRUCE led to greater auto-cleavage activity of pro-caspase-9 (Fig. 4D). Accordingly, with the RNAi for BRUCE, there was additionally an accumulation of the processed caspase-9 (Fig. 4D). This accumulation could also be due to the reduced degradation of caspase-9. Taken together, these findings suggest that BRUCE normally inhibits the cleavage of pro-caspase-9 by inhibiting its auto-cleaving activity but it may also retard the breakdown of mature caspase-9. To test whether BRUCE inhibits the activity of caspase-9, BRUCE was incubated with the recombinant caspase-9 in the presence of LEHD-7-AMC. Full-length BRUCE, but not its C-terminal region, markedly inhibited caspase-9 activity (Fig. 4E). In contrast, unlike XIAP, BRUCE did not inhibit hydrolyses of DEVD-AMC and pro-caspase-9 by caspase-3 (Fig. 4, F and G). Therefore, BRUCE appears to be a potent inhibitor of the initiator caspase but not effector caspases. HtrA2 Associates with and Cleaves BRUCE—HtrA2 is another pro-apoptotic factor containing an IAP binding motif. In 293T cells transfected with the Myc-tagged C-terminal region of BRUCE, endogenous mature HtrA2 was coimmunoprecipitated with BRUCE and XIAP but not with the Myc-tagged C-terminal region of BRUCE (Fig. 5A). Because the Smac precursor interacted with BRUCE, we tested whether the precursor of HtrA2 did also. When the 35S-labeled precursor of HtrA2 (synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation) was incubated with BRUCE or XIAP, it could be pulled down with an antibody against BRUCE but not an anti-XIAP antibody (Fig. 5B). When the N-terminal sequence was replaced by Met, this form of HtrA2 (HtrA2-(Δ2–133)) no longer associated with BRUCE (Fig. 5B). Thus, BRUCE associates with both the precursor and the mature form of HtrA2. HtrA2 is a serine protease that cleaves certain IAPs (28Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1487-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 29Jin S. Kalkum M. Overholtzer M. Stoffel A. Chait B.T. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined whether BRUCE is also a substrate for HtrA2. Overexpression of HtrA2 reduced the levels of BRUCE in 293T cells (Fig. 5C). HtrA2-(Δ2–133) also reduced the levels of BRUCE, although it did not form a stable complex with BRUCE. To further determine whether HtrA2 cleaves BRUCE, immunopurified BRUCE was incubated with the purified mature HtrA2. BRUCE was cleaved by HtrA2, and two fragments of 180 and 150 kDa could be detected with the anti-BRUCE antibody in Western blots (Fig. 5D). Thus, similar to other IAPs, BRUCE is a substrate for HtrA2. During Apoptosis, BRUCE Can Be Degraded by Proteasomes or Cleaved by HtrA2 or Caspases—In response to apoptotic stimuli, most IAPs can be destroyed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway or by caspases (13Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 30Johnson D.E. Gastman B.R. Wieckowski E. Wang G.Q. Amoscato A. Delach S.M. Rabinowich H. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the sequence of BRUCE was found to contain multiple putative cleavage sites for caspases-1, -3, -6, -7, and -8 (Supplemental Table 1s). Therefore, we measured the levels of BRUCE in the lysates of 293T cells following in vitro caspase activation by cytochrome c and dATP. As expected, the levels of BRUCE decreased markedly upon caspase activation and this decrease could be blocked by two general caspase inhibitors, Z-VAD-fmk or BD-fmk (Fig. 6A). Under these cell-free conditions, the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, at concentrations that block proteasomal activity (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) had no effects (Fig. 6A). Thus, BRUCE can be cleaved by caspases under conditions where the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is inactive. To determine which caspases were responsible for this cleavage, we incubated the immunopurified BRUCE with purified caspases. All of the four caspases tested, especially caspases-3 and -9, appeared to cleave BRUCE (Fig. 6B). During apoptosis, BRUCE can also be ubiquitinated by Nrdp1 and degraded by the proteasome (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In HeLa cells, both Z-VAD-fmk and lactacystin were found to partially reduce the loss of BRUCE induced by etoposide (a topoisomerase inhibitor) (Fig. 6C). Therefore, both caspases and proteasomes contribute to the destruction of BRUCE induced by etoposide. It is noteworthy that, in the absence of etoposide, the treatment with Z-VAD-fmk or lactacystin for 12 h also increased the levels of BRUCE, suggesting that caspases and the proteasome also contribute to the destruction of BRUCE under normal conditions. In 293T cells, which possessed no detectable active caspases-7 and -9 (Fig. 6D and data not shown), lactacystin still inhibited the etoposide-induced degradation of BRUCE (Fig. 6D). Thus, in these cells, proteasomal degradation of BRUCE does not require caspase activation. However, the pathway primarily responsible for the destruction of BRUCE seems to vary with apoptotic stimuli. As shown in Fig. 6E, in HeLa cells, Z-VAD-fmk could completely block the TNFα-induced loss of BRUCE, suggesting that caspase cleavage is the dominant mechanism for TNFα-mediated cleavage of BRUCE. Thus, in addition to being cleaved by HtrA2, BRUCE can also be degraded by the proteasome and/or cleaved by caspases, depending on the nature of apoptotic stimulus and cell. Unlike other mammalian IAPs, BRUCE/Apollon is essential for viability of various cell lines (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and the knockout of BRUCE in mice causes embryonic or neonatal lethality (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). During the preparation of this paper, important complementary findings regarding the function of BRUCE were published by Bartke et al. (31Bartke T. Pohl C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and Hao et al. (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). These studies demonstrated that overproduction of BRUCE suppressed apoptosis in mammalian cells, in accordance with our finding that decreasing endogenous BRUCE promoted apoptotic cell death (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It is clear from all of these studies that BRUCE has multiple anti-apoptotic actions that antagonize the pro-apoptotic actions of Smac and caspases (for a review, see Ref. 32Martin S.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 804-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). By co-transfecting BRUCE and mature Smac (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), Hao et al. (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) showed that BRUCE promotes degradation of mature Smac. These results complement our finding that reducing the cellular content of BRUCE by RNAi or overexpression of Nrdp1 leads to reduced degradation of both the endogenous and transfected Smac. However, this study has uncovered some additional surprising features of BRUCE action that differ from those found in these related studies. Specifically, we have found that: (A) BRUCE, unlike other IAPs, can bind to the precursor of Smac and promote its degradation; (B) BRUCE, unlike other IAPs, can bind to pro-caspase-9 and inhibit its cleavage to the mature form; (C) BRUCE can also inhibit the activity of mature caspase-9 but not the effector caspase, caspase-3; and (D) multiple caspases and HtrA2 (in addition to the proteasome) can degrade BRUCE during apoptosis. This exceptional ability of BRUCE to antagonize the precursors of Smac and pro-caspase-9 (in addition to their mature forms) might explain why BRUCE is the only essential IAP in mammals. Overexpression of the Smac precursor has been shown to promote the apoptosis induced by certain apoptotic stimuli (5Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar, 6Verhagen A.M. Ekert P.G. Pakusch M. Silke J. Connolly L.M. Reid G.E. Moritz R.L. Simpson R.J. Vaux D.L. Cell. 2000; 102: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar), although this precursor by itself is probably inactive in promoting apoptosis. Presumably, this enhancement of apoptosis occurred because higher amounts of this precursor in the cytosol led to increased levels of Smac in the mitochondria; therefore, the cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli rises. Thus, BRUCE-mediated degradation of the Smac precursor can be important in making cells more resistant to apoptotic stimuli. It is noteworthy in this regard that, under normal conditions, the levels of Smac in various tissues are inversely correlated with the content of BRUCE, presumably because of BRUCE-mediated degradation of the Smac precursor. The additional capacity of BRUCE to bind and destroy mature Smac after its release from mitochondria (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) should inhibit the apoptotic process once it has been activated. Because BRUCE binds to Smac (as well as caspase-9) and contains an E2 motif capable of accepting activated ubiquitin from E1 (16Hauser H.P. Bardroff M. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1415-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), it should have the capacity to conjugate ubiquitin to these pro-apoptotic proteins (i.e. to act as both an E3 and E2). Indeed, BRUCE (together with E1) has been shown to catalyze ubiquitination of mature Smac (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Bartke T. Pohl C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), including the formation of polyUb chains necessary for proteasomal degradation (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Presumably, BRUCE also catalyzes the ubiquitination and degradation of the Smac precursor by a similar mechanism. Our finding that BRUCE associates with the Smac precursor as well as the mature form was unexpected. This ability to act on the Smac precursor not only has important regulatory consequences but also indicates that BRUCE functions by distinct mechanisms from other IAPs. Because the N-terminal sequence of the precursor prevents the interaction of the IAP binding motif of Smac (AVPI) with other IAPs (5Du C. Fang M. Li Y. Li L. Wang X. Cell. 2000; 102: 33-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2925) Google Scholar), Smac must associate with BRUCE through a novel mechanism. Accordingly, the mutation of this AVPI sequence to AAAI blocked the association of mature Smac with XIAP but only slightly reduced the extent of its association with BRUCE. Because the BRUCE BIR domain by itself could not bind to Smac (Supplemental Fig. 1s), some additional region appears to be required for these associations. In fact, the closely related BIR domain of Survivin is also not sufficient by itself to bind to mature Smac (33Song Z. Yao X. Wu M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23130-23140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In contrast to results shown here, Bartke et al. (31Bartke T. Pohl C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) failed to detect an association of BRUCE with the precursor of Smac, perhaps because they used an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase fusion of the Smac precursor. As we showed here (Fig. 1D), the N-terminal sequence of the Smac precursor is important for its association with BRUCE and the presence of the large glutathione S-transferase moiety might well interfere with the binding of the Smac precursor to BRUCE. Pro-caspase-9 in complex with Apaf-1, similar to the processed caspase-9, can activate pro-caspase-3, and the ectopic expression of pro-caspase-9 promotes apoptosis (22Srinivasula S.M. Hegde R. Saleh A. Datta P. Shiozaki E. Chai J. Lee R.A. Robbins P.D. Fernandes-Alnemri T. Shi Y. Alnemri E.S. Nature. 2001; 410: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar, 23Duan H. Orth K.

Because pro-caspase-9 is resistant to other IAPs, the ability of BRUCE to interact with pro-caspase-9 is likely to be especially important in the inhibition of apoptosis in normal cells. BRUCE also associated with and inhibited the processed caspase-9 but not the active caspase-3. In contrast, several IAPs inhibit both caspase-9 and caspase-3. BRUCE thus appears to differ from other IAPs by only inhibiting the initial steps of the caspase cascade. Although BRUCE was not found to directly inhibit caspase-3 (as shown here by direct enzymatic assays), Bartke et al. (31Bartke T. Pohl C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) recently reported that BRUCE inhibits caspase-3 activation in 293T cell lysates. Therefore, this inhibition of caspase-3 activation in the cell lysates by BRUCE is probably an indirect downstream consequence of the inhibition of pro-caspase-9 or caspase-9 activity. In addition, Hao et al. (21Hao Y. Sekine K. Kawabata A. Nakamura H. Ishioka T. Ohata H. Katayama R. Hashimoto C. Zhang X. Noda T. Tsuruo T. Naito M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) recently reported that transfected BRUCE promotes degradation of the processed caspase-9, which is consistent with our finding that RNAi for BRUCE led to an accumulation of the processed endogenous caspase-9 in HeLa cells. Once the normal balance between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors starts to tip toward apoptosis, cell death quickly develops due to the release and activation of pro-apoptotic factors as well as the degradation and inhibition of anti-apoptotic factors. For example, in response to apoptotic stimuli, certain IAPs can be removed by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, HtrA2, and/or caspases (13Yang Y. Fang S. Jensen J.P. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 2000; 288: 874-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 28Yang Q.H. Church-Hajduk R. Ren J. Newton M.L. Du C.

Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1818-1823PubMed Google Scholar). Upon initiation of apoptosis, BRUCE levels fall in various types of cells (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In response to certain apoptotic stimuli (e.g. etoposide), Nrdp1 promotes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of BRUCE (17Qiu X.B. Markant S.L. Yuan J. Goldberg A.L. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 800-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This study shows that, depending on the nature of apoptotic stimulus and cell, BRUCE can also be efficiently degraded by HtrA2 and multiple caspases. Because BRUCE is important in inhibiting apoptosis under normal conditions, its degradation must be a key irreversible step in the initiation of the apoptotic process; therefore, it is not surprising that mammalian cells contain multiple enzymatic and signaling systems to trigger its destruction.

SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase (SARS 3CLpro) plays key roles in viral replication and transcription and is an attractive target for anti-SARS drug discovery.

Glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE and size-exclusion chromatography results show that, similar to the full-length SARS 3CLpro, the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro still remains a dimer/monomer mixture within a wide range of protein concentrations. Isothermal titration calorimeter determinations indicate that the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer (262 μm) is very similar to that of the full-length proteinase dimer (227 μm). Enzymatic activity assay using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer method reveals that N-terminal deletion results in almost complete loss of enzymatic activity for SARS 3CLpro. Molecular dynamics and docking simulations demonstrate the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer adopts a state different from that of the full-length proteinase dimer, which increases the angle between the two protomers and reduces the binding pocket that is not beneficial to the substrate binding. This conclusion is verified by the surface plasmon resonance biosensor determination, indicating that the model substrate cannot bind to the N-terminal deleted proteinase.

Because of its functional indispensability in the coronavirus life cycle, SARS 3CLpro has become an attractive target in discovering new anti-SARS agents.

Ziebuhr J. Higenfeld R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3213-3224Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). As the crystal structures of 3CL proteinases in different coronaviruses give similar dimeric structures (8Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar, 9Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G.F. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and nearly all side chains of 3CLpro involved in the formation of the dimer are conserved, it has been proposed that the dimer might be the biological functional form of 3CLpro (8Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). From the dimeric structures of coronavirus 3CLpros, it has been also predicted that domain III might play a role in substrate recognition and be responsible for positioning the N terminus of one protomer (monomer) to interact with the active site of the other protomer (9Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G.F. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The critical role of domain III in dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS 3CLpro has been presented by a recent study (12Shi J. Wei Z. Song J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24765-24773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In addition, Lai and co-workers (13Fan K. Wei P. Feng Q. Chen S. Huang C. Ma L. Lai B. Pei J. Liu Y. Chen J. Lai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1637-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) reported that SARS 3CLpro exists as a monomer/dimer mixture at a relatively high protein concentration (∼4 mg/ml) and is exclusively monomer at a lower protein concentration (∼0.2 mg/ml) in solution, and only the dimer was the active form of the proteinase. Based on the crystal structures and biochemical studies of several coronavirus 3CLpros, one hypothesis was proposed that the N-terminal residues 1–7 might play an important role in both dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS 3CLpro (9Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G.F. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). However, our molecular dynamics simulations revealed that the N terminus was not necessary for the dimer formation of SARS 3CLpro, i.e. the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro may possibly form a dimer with a new state different from the full-length proteinase. Therefore, further systematic analyses of the role of the N terminus in dimerization and enzymatic activity of SARS 3CLpro may contribute to understanding the biological function of 3CLpros. In the following, we report our biochemical and biophysical studies of the dimerization and proteolytic activities of the full-length and N-terminal residues 1–7 deleted SARS 3CLpros using CD spectroscopy, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), glutaraldehyde cross-linking SDS-PAGE, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), and isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) techniques. The experimental results are consistent with the MD simulations on these two 3CLpros. It is demonstrated that the N terminus of SARS 3CLpro is necessary for its enzymatic activity but not for dimerization. The N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro can still form a dimer, and the binding affinity between the two protomers is almost equal to that of the full-length SARS 3CLpro. Compared with the full-length SARS 3CLpro, the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro forms a dimer adopting a different conformational state, which reduces substrate-binding pocket, thereby abolishing the proteolytic activity of SARS 3CLpro. This conclusion is verified by molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor determination, indicating that the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro has almost completely lost the binding affinity to a model peptide substrate. Materials—The restriction and modifying enzymes used in this work were purchased from Takara, and the vector pQE30 and the bacterial strain M15 were from Qiagen. TRIzol and Superscript II reverse transcriptase were bought from Invitrogen. DNase and RNase were from New England Biolabs. The chelating column and low molecular weight markers for SDS-PAGE were from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of reagent grade or ultra-pure quality and purchased from Sigma. The Full-length and N-terminal Deleted SARS 3CLpros Preparations—The full-length SARS 3CLpro was obtained according to our published method (14Sun H. Luo H. Yu C. Sun T. Chen J. Peng S. Qin J. Shen J. Yang Y. Xie Y. Chen K. Wang Y. Shen X. Jiang H. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 32: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The proteinase was highly pure according to SDS-PAGE and dialyzed to 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and 1 mm EDTA. The purified protein was further confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry and concentrated by Centriprep (Millipore). The protein concentration used in all experiments was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm. The cloning of N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro (residues 8–303) was processed by a modified PCR method using pQE30-SARS 3CLpro as template. The nucleotide sequences of the primers used for N-terminal deletion mutagenesis are as follows: 5′-AATGGATCCACCATGTTCCCGTCAGGCAAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TATAAGCTTTTGGAAGGTAACACCAGAGCATTG-3′ (reverse). The pQE30-SARS 3CLpro plasmid encoding the N-terminal deleted form of SARS 3CLpro was verified by sequencing and then transformed into Escherichia coli M15 cells, and the recombinant protein was expressed and purified in a procedure similar to that of the full-length proteinase. The purity and structural integrity of the N-terminal deleted proteinase were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry. The concentrated proteinase was stored in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, at -20 °C. CD Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco-810 spectropolarimeter collected with thermal controller. The protein sample was prepared in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl at 25 °C with concentration of 10 μm. Far-UV CD spectra from 195 to 250 nm were collected with 1 nm bandwidth using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette and normalized by subtracting the base line recorded for the buffer under identical conditions. Thermally induced unfolding with a temperature range from 30 to 75 °C was monitored at 222 nm by heating velocity of 2 °C/min. Each measurement was repeated three times, and the final result was the average of the three independent scans. Enzymatic Activity Assay—The enzymatic activities of the full-length and N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpros were measured by FRET-based assays using a 12-amino acid fluorogenic substrate, EDANS-VN-STLQSGLRK(Dabcyl)-M (supplemental Fig. S1), that was synthesized and characterized by using a modified procedure described by methods published previously (15Garcia-Echeverria C. Rich D.H. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 100-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Chen S. Chen L.L. Luo H.B. Sun T. Chen J. Ye F. Cai J.H. Shen J.K. Shen X. Jiang H.L. Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2005; 26: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Stock solution of the fluorogenic substrate was prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) and stored at -20 °C. Subsequent dilutions were performed using the assay buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA) with the final concentration of Me2SO less than 1% (v/v). Kinetic assays were performed continuously in a 1-ml quartz cuvette with a 1-cm path length at 25 °C. During the assay, the enzyme (final concentration 1 μm) was preincubated for 30 min at 25 °C in the cuvette containing the assay buffer, followed by the addition of the fluorogenic substrate stock solution to a final concentration of 10 μm. The increase in emission fluorescence intensity was recorded at a 10-min interval on a Hitachi F-2500 fluorescence spectrophotometer connected with a thermostat. During the fluorescent measurement, the instrument was first set to zero with the fluorogenic substrate itself in the assay buffer. Cleavage of the substrate as a function of time was followed by monitoring the emission fluorescence intensity at a 490 nm wavelength upon excitation at 340 nm (slit width 10 nm), and the initial reaction velocity (ν0) was determined from the linear portion of the progress curve. The final emission fluorescence intensity of the totally hydrolyzed substrate was determined by adding the full-length SARS 3CLpro until no emission fluorescence intensity change at 490 nm wavelength was recorded. Enzymatic activity was the average of three parallel assays, and the activity of the full-length SARS 3CLpro was taken as 100%. Glutaraldehyde Cross-linking SDS-PAGE—For the full-length and N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpros (final concentration from 1 to 7 mg/ml in 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA), an aliquot of 25% (v/v) glutaraldehyde was added to make a final concentration of 0.01 or 0.1% glutaraldehyde. This sample was incubated at 25 °C for 30 min followed by quenching the cross-linking reaction by adding 1.25 μl of 1.4 m ethanolamine, pH 8.0. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm, 4 °C), the precipitate was redissolved in loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was run with 10% gels. Size-exclusion Chromatography (SEC) Analysis—The dimer-monomer equilibria of the full-length and N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpros were studied by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75 prep grade column through an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences). Buffer used was 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA. The buffer was degassed, and the column was equilibrated with the buffer before injecting protein samples. Protein samples with a wide range of concentrations from 1 to 7 mg/ml were loaded on the column and then eluted with the buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min by detection of absorbance at 280 nm. The integrated area values of absorbance peaks were calibrated by AKTA FPLC evaluation software. The column was calibrated by using a low molecular weight gel filtration kit (Amersham Biosciences) with the following four marker proteins: ribonuclease A (15.6 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (22.8 kDa), ovalbumin (48.9 kDa), and albumin (65.4 kDa). Standard calibration curves were obtained by plotting the ratio of peak elution volume (Ve) minus void volume (V0) to total bed volume (Vt) minus void volume (Ve - V0)/(Vt - V0) against the logarithm of molecular mass. ITC Determination—Dilution ITC analyses for monomer-dimer equilibrium were carried out at 25 °C using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA). All solutions were thoroughly degassed before use. Before each experiment, the ITC sample cell was washed several times with doubly distilled water followed by loading with 1.43 ml of the assay buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA), and the reference cell contained doubly distilled water. Titration was carried out using a 250-μl syringe filled with the concentrated full-length or N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro solution (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), with stirring at 300 rpm. The concentrations of protein were varied between 500 and 600 μm. A typical dilution ITC experiment involved 30 sequential injections of 10-μl volume of concentrated protein solution into the sample cell initially containing the assay buffer alone, with 20 s duration each and a 300-s interval between injections. This titration gave rise to a series of endothermic heat pulses which, after correction for appropriate buffer mixing control experiments under identical conditions, could be analyzed using Microcal ORIGIN software and purpose-made software in terms of a simple dimer-monomer dissociation model to give the dissociation constant of the dimer (Kd) and the enthalpy change of dimerization (ΔHdim0). Standard thermodynamic quantities were calculated using the general thermodynamic Equation 1. ΔGdim0=RTlnKd=ΔHdim0−TΔSdim0(Eq. 1) Molecular Dynamics Simulation—The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the GROMACS package version 3.1.4 (17van der Berendsen H.J.C. Spoel D. van Drunen A.R. Comp. Phys. Comm. 1995; 91: 43-56Crossref Scopus (7262) Google Scholar) with the GROMOS87 force field (18Van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Gromos-87 Manual. Biomos BV, Nijenborgh 4 9747 AG Groningen, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar). The models for the MD simulations were built up based on the x-ray crystal structure of SARS 3CLpro at a 1.9-Å resolution (Protein Data Bank entry code 1UJ1) (9Yang H. Yang M. Ding Y. Liu Y. Lou Z. Zhou Z. Sun L. Mo L. Ye S. Pang H. Gao G.F. Anand K. Bartlam M. Hilgenfeld R. Rao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13190-13195Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). To construct the three-dimensional model of the full-length SARS 3CLpro dimer (model 1) for the MD simulations, the coordinates of the missing residues, Ser-A1 and Gly-A2 in protomer A, were repaired using the molecular modeling software Sybyl 6.8 (molecular modeling package, version 6.8. St. Louis, MO, Tripos Associates). The initial three-dimensional model (model 2) of the N-terminal deleted proteinase dimer was constructed by deleting residues 1–7 from model 1. These two models were simulated in a water environment. Water was described by the simple point charge model (19Berendsen H.J.C. Postma J.P.M. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar). All bond lengths including hydrogen atoms were constrained by the LINCS algorithm (20Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J.C. Fraaije J.G.E.M. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11739) Google Scholar). The simulation cell was a rectangular periodic box with the minimum distance between the protein and the box walls set to 0.75 nm, so that the protein did not directly interact with its own periodic image given the cut off. Numerical integration of the equations of motion used a time step of 2 fs, with atomic coordinates saved every 10 ps for analysis. To neutralize the modeled system and simulate the physiological conditions, 210 water molecules were replaced by 102 Cl- and 108 Na+ ions in model 1, and 222 water molecules were replaced by 106 Cl- and 116 Na+ ions in model 2; these ions were located at positions of the chosen water oxygen atoms. At the end, model 1 contained 5988 protein atoms and 38,091 solvent molecules in a 9.1 × 8.7 × 15.8-nm3 box, and model 2 contained 5804 solute atoms and 40,289 solvent molecules in a 9.3 × 9.7 × 14.7-nm3 box. All water molecules and ions with the whole fixed protein were energy-minimized with steepest descent until reaching the convergence value of 100 kJ/mol·nm. Afterward, minimizations were performed continuously on the protein by fixing the main chain and C-α atoms, respectively. After heating the systems (solute and solvent) to 300 K, two 5-ns MD simulations were performed on models 1 and 2, respectively. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) Biosensor Analysis—A 6-amino acid peptide (TSAVLQ) representing the N-terminal P6–P1 sequence of a reported best peptide substrate (TSAVLQSGFRK) for SARS 3CLpro (13Fan K. Wei P. Feng Q. Chen S. Huang C. Ma L. Lai B. Pei J. Liu Y. Chen J. Lai L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1637-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) was synthesized as a model substrate. The binding affinities of the full-length and N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpros to the substrate peptide were determined using the SPR biosensor technology (21Spiga O. Bernini A. Scarselli M. Ciutti A. Bracci L. Lozzi L. Lelli B. Maro DiD. Calamandrei D. Niccolai N. FEBS Lett. 2002; 511: 33-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The measurements were performed using the dual flow cell Biacore 3000 instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). The full-length or N-terminal deleted proteinase was immobilized to one of the four serial measurement cells of the sensor chip surface by standard Biacore procedure using HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20, pH 7.4) and a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The protein was coupled covalently to the carboxymethylated dextran of a CM5 sensor chip by amino coupling. Carboxyl groups in the immobilization matrix were first activated by treatment with a fresh mixture of 0.2 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride and 50 mmN-hydroxysuccinimide for 7 min. To ensure an identical amount of the full-length and N-terminal deleted proteinases immobilized to the sensor chip, the protein at the same concentration (10 mg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.2) was then injected over the surface until a desired immobilization level (4000 RU) was reached. Finally, unreacted N-hydroxysuccinimide esters were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, for 7 min. Binding affinity measurements were performed in a continuous flow of 20 μl/min HBS-EP as the running buffer. The 6-amino acid peptide substrate was diluted in the running buffer and automatically injected in a series of increasing concentrations (20–500 μm). The binding responses were recorded continuously in resonance units (RU) at a frequency of 1 Hz as sensorgrams and presented as a function of time. Sensorgrams were processed by using automatic correction for nonspecific bulk refractive index effects. The equilibrium constants (KD) were estimated by the steady-state binding affinity fitting model encoded in the Biacore analysis software. Folding Behavior and Thermal Stability of the N-terminal Deleted Proteinase—With the similar preparation strategy for the full-length SARS 3CLpro (14Sun H. Luo H. Yu C. Sun T. Chen J. Peng S. Qin J. Shen J. Yang Y. Xie Y. Chen K. Wang Y. Shen X. Jiang H. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 32: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro was also successfully cloned and expressed in E. coli M15 cells. The majority of the proteins could be obtained in the soluble fraction of the cell lysate after introduction with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 5 h. The molecular weights of the purified proteins were characterized by LCQ-DECA MS (Thermofinnigan, San Jose, CA) (data not shown). The measured masses of the full-length and N-terminal deleted proteinases are 35,831 and 35,055 daltons, respectively, which are well in agreement with the values calculated from the protein sequences. Fig. 1 shows the CD spectra of the full-length and N-terminal deleted proteinases. Far-UV spectra of the two proteins give a positive peak at 196 nm characteristic of a β-sheet structure, and dual negative peaks at 209 and 222 nm, respectively, typical of an α-helical structure (Fig. 1a), indicating that the secondary structure of the N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpro is similar to that of the full-length proteinase, and also similar to those of TGEV and HCoV 229E 3CLpros (8Anand K. Ziebuhr J. Wadhwani P. Mesters J.R. Hilgenfeld R. Science. 2003; 300: 1763-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). This excludes the possibility of structural misfolding caused by N-terminal deletion (residues 1–7). Thermal induced unfolding of the two proteins was performed by monitoring the continuous changes of CD signals at 222 nm within temperatures ranging from 30 to 75 °C, the results are shown in Fig. 1b. As Fig. 1b indicates, the N-terminal deletion does not dramatically affect the denaturation behavior of the proteinase, and the N-terminal deleted proteinase adopts a thermal induced unfolding profile similar to that of the full-length proteinase. The transition temperature (Tm) of the N-terminal deleted proteinase was estimated as 60.5 °C, which is very close to that of the full-length proteinase, 61.4 °C. All these results imply that N-terminal deletion has not changed the folding manner and thermal stability of the proteinase.Fig. 1CD spectra of the full-length and N-terminal deleted SARS 3CLpros.a, far-UV CD spectra of the full-length (▪) and N-terminal deleted (○) SARS 3CLpros at 25 °C. b, thermal induced unfolding monitored at 222 nm with a temperature range from 30 to 75 °C for the full-length (▪) and N-terminal deleted (○) SARS 3CLpros.

https://openalex.org/W2034175826,"Adrenergic stimulation induces positive changes in cardiac contractility and relaxation. Cardiac troponin I is phosphorylated at different sites by protein kinase A and protein kinase C, but the effects of these post-translational modifications on the rate and extent of contractility and relaxation during β-adrenergic stimulation in the intact animal remain obscure. To investigate the effect(s) of complete and chronic cTnI phosphorylation on cardiac function, we generated transgenic animals in which the five possible phosphorylation sites were replaced with aspartic acid, mimicking a constant state of complete phosphorylation (cTnI-AllP). We hypothesized that chronic and complete phosphorylation of cTnI might result in increased morbidity or mortality, but complete replacement with the transgenic protein was benign with no detectable pathology. To differentiate the effects of the different phosphorylation sites, we generated another mouse model, cTnI-PP, in which only the protein kinase A phosphorylation sites (Ser23/Ser24) were mutated to aspartic acid. In contrast to the cTnIAllP, the cTnI-PP mice showed enhanced diastolic function under basal conditions. The cTnI-PP animals also showed augmented relaxation and contraction at higher heart rates compared with the nontransgenic controls. Nuclear magnetic resonance amide proton/nitrogen chemical shift analysis of cardiac troponin C showed that, in the presence of cTnI-AllP and cTnI-PP, the N terminus exhibits a more closed conformation, respectively. The data show that protein kinase C phosphorylation of cTnI plays a dominant role in depressing contractility and exerts an antithetic role on the ability of protein kinase A to increase relaxation.

The protein binds to both cTnC and actin and is a critical component in activating contraction as it serves as the Ca2+-sensing apparatus. Within the cardiac isoform's amino-terminal extension, serines are present at residues 23 and 24 (Ser23/Ser24), which serve as substrates for protein kinase A (PKA), which is activated in response to β-adrenergic stimulation of the heart (3Chandra M.

Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 1059-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), and increased binding of cTnI to the thin filament. Cardiac TnI is also a substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation at Ser43/Ser45 and Thr144 (position 143 in the human protein) (6Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M.

However, the substrate specificity of these sites is not absolute, since PKC can phosphorylate the PKA sites (7Swiderek K. Jaquet K. Meyer H.E. Schachtele C. Hofmann F. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14923-14931Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Whereas PKA-mediated phosphorylation is thought to mainly affect the overall Ca2+ sensitivity of force development, PKC phosphorylation of TnI inhibits the actin-myosin interaction by decreasing maximum tension, Mg2+-ATPase activity, Ca2+ sensitivity, and thin filament sliding speed (10Burkart E.M.

These effects are important determinants in the enhanced relaxation that is critical to the response of the heart to adrenergic stimulation (11Wolska B.M. Arteaga G.M. Pena J.R. Nowak G.

Normally, there is little or no adrenergic drive in the human left ventricle (13Haber H.L. Simek C.L. Gimple L.W. Bergin J.D. Subbiah K. Jayaweera A.R. Powers E.R. Feldman M.D. Circulation. 1993; 88: 1610-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Whereas increased adrenergic drive is beneficial in initially supporting normal cardiac function, chronic β-adrenergic stimulation can exacerbate an underlying pathology. However, it is unclear whether constant stimulation at the myofibrillar level through the β-adrenergic pathway, as manifested by chronic phosphorylation of the myofibrillar protein targets, causes the deleterious effects. The present study was aimed at determining in vivo whether PKA and/or PKC phosphorylation of TnI were determining factors in mediating contraction or relaxation at base line or during cardiovascular stimulation. In a first iteration, rather than trying to segregate the effects of PKA and PKC phosphorylation, we chose to convert both the PKA and PKC sites in cTnI to aspartic acid to mimic a constant state of complete phosphorylation (cTnIAllP), since PKC can cross-phosphorylate the PKA sites (8Jideama N.M. Noland Jr., T.A. Raynor R.L. Blobe G.C. Fabbro D. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Hannun Y.A. Kuo J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23277-23283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To investigate the long term effects of TnI charge modification via phosphorylation, we mimicked PKA and PKC cTnI phosphorylation by replacing the endogenous cardiac protein with transgenically encoded cTnI in which the five substrate residues, Ser23/Ser24 (PKA) and Ser43/Ser45/Thr144 (PKC), were replaced by aspartic acid, whose charge mimics the endogenous residues' phosphorylated state. To segregate the functional role of PKC-mediated phosphorylation from PKA effects, we also generated a transgenic (TG) mouse in which only the PKA sites (Ser23/Ser24) were mutated to aspartic acid (cTnI-PP). A comparison of their contractile functions and responses to β-adrenergic stimulation allowed us to determine that PKC phosphorylation can antagonize the effects of PKA-induced cTnI phosphorylation in the whole animal and that the primary in vivo function of PKC-mediated cTnI phosphorylation is to decrease contractility at base line and increase relaxation during β-adrenergic stimulation. Transgene Construction—The wild type (WT) cDNA for mouse cTnI was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR using total RNA isolated from the mouse cardiac ventricle. The cDNA (cTnI-WT) was subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced in full as described (14James J. Zhang Y. Osinska H. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation sites (Ser23/Ser24 by PKA; Ser43/Ser45 and Thr144 by PKC) were mutated to aspartic acid to mimic a constant state of phosphorylation using standard PCR-based methods (cTnI-AllP). In parallel, the PKA phosphorylation sites of cTnI (Ser23/Ser24) were mutated to aspartic acid to produce the cTnI-PP construct. The cTnI-AllP and cTnI-PP cDNAs were subcloned into the mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter (Fig. 1), and the construct was purified from the plasmid backbone after NotI digestion. The DNAs were subsequently used to generate multiple lines of TG mice for each construct (15Palermo J. Gulick J. Colbert M. Fewell J. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Except where noted, five or six mice, 12-15 weeks old of mixed gender were used in each experiment after preliminary experiments showed no gender differences. Molecular Analyses—For assessment of cTnI-AllP and cTnI-PP transcript size, Northern blot analyses were performed using 7.5 μg of total RNA, as described (14James J. Zhang Y. Osinska H. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Expression levels were determined by RNA dot blot analysis with γ-32P-labeled cTnI and human growth hormone probes using transcript-specific oligonucleotides (14James J. Zhang Y. Osinska H. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Protein Analyses—Enriched myofibrillar proteins were isolated using F60 buffer (60 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole, 7.2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.0) with protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Mixture I and II; Sigma) as described (16Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The percentage of cTnI-AllP replacement was estimated via SDS-PAGE (4-15 or 8-16% criterion gradient Tris-glycine precast gels; Bio-Rad), Western blots, and MALDI-TOF. The cTnI-PP replacement was calculated by MALDI-TOF, since the TG species could not be separated from endogenous TnI via gel electrophoresis. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed using the Immobiline DryS-trip kit (Amersham Biosciences) and ReadyStrip (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturers' guidelines to identify shifts due to phosphorylation. Myofibrillar proteins from cTnI-AllP, cTnI-PP, and NTG hearts were prepared for isoelectric focusing by dilution of 50-75 μg in 185 μl of immobilized pH gradient rehydration buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 0.5% of the appropriate carrier ampholytes and subjected to isoelectric focusing on immobilized pH gradient strips (11 cm, pH 3-10, pH 4-7, or pH 7-10 linear gradient; Bio-Rad), followed by 10-20% gradient SDS-PAGE (Criterion gradient Tris-glycine precast gels; Bio-Rad). The gels were stained with SYPRO-Ruby (Bio-Rad), and protein spots were analyzed using HT Analyzer version 3.0 (Genomic Solutions) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) to quantitate the level of myofibrillar protein phosphorylation. Antibodies used for Western blot analysis were against cTnI (Cell Signaling Technology), α-tropomyosin, cTnT, actin (Sigma), myosin light chain 1v (17James J. Zhang Y. Wright K. Witt S. Glascock E.

Cardiol. 2002; 34: 873-882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and myosin light chain 2v (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Immunohistochemistry—Heart/body weights were first measured in order to determine whether hypertrophy had occurred. Hearts were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Five-μm cryostat sections were probed with polyclonal antibodies against cTnI followed by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody. Specimens were examined using confocal microscopy. For paraffin sectioning, hearts from littermates were perfusion-fixed with 10% formalin, embedded, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or Masson trichrome (14James J. Zhang Y. Osinska H. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Structural analyses at the light and electron microscopy levels were performed as described (18Sanbe A. Fewell J.G. Gulick J. Osinska H. Lorenz J. Hall D.G. Murray L.A. Kimball T.R. Witt S.A.

Using 2-4 mice of mixed gender, multiple sections were cut, and >50 fields were observed by a blinded observer. In Vitro PKA and PKC Phosphorylation—Total skinned myofibrils were isolated as described above in the presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Fisher) and protease/phosphatase inhibitors (Mixture I and II; Sigma). The phosphorylation assays contained 100 μg of freshly isolated total skinned myofibrils (19Yang Q. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Sanbe A. Wang X. Robbins J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 51: 80-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Myofibrils were incubated 120 min at 37 °C in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 μm ATP, and 30 units of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAce kit; Novagen). For PKC phosphorylation, 100 μg of skinned myofibrils were incubated 120 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of solution containing 10 μm ATP, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm imidazole, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm benzamidine, and purified ϵ-PKC (5 ng/μl) activated with phosphatidylserine (100 μg/ml), dioctanoylglycerol (10 μg/ml), and 50 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma). The PKA inhibitor PKI 6-22 (Amide; Calbiochem) and PKC inhibitor myr-PKC (Sigma) were used for control studies. Myofibrils were washed three times in F60 and either solubilized in rehydration/sample buffer (Bio-Rad) for two-dimensional gel electrophoresis or suspended in F60 buffer for the Mg2+-ATPase assay. Myofibrillar Mg2+-ATPase Assays—Myofibrillar Mg2+-ATPase activity was determined by measuring inorganic phosphate release (20Krenz M. Sanbe A. Bouyer-Dalloz F. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Osinska H.E. Lorenz J.N. Brosseau C. Federico A. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. Perryman M.B. Helmke S.M. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17466-17474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Skinned myofibrillar proteins were purified as described (16Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 2630-2639Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), treated with either PKA or PKC, and suspended in F60 buffer. Protein was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad protein assay). The reaction mixture contained 0.2-0.4 mg/ml myofibrillar proteins, 60 mm imidazole, 6 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm ATP (pH 7.0). Assays were carried out in 96-well microtiter plates at pCa2+ concentrations ranging from pCa 8.0-4.0 at room temperature during the linear Pi release phase of the reaction. Incubations were performed in triplicate from five animals of each group. The 100-μl reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then quenched with 40 μl of 15% trichloroacetic acid. Precipitated proteins were pelleted at 4 °C, 80 μl of the supernatant (containing Pi) was transferred to microtiter plates, and 160 μl of FeSO4-ammonium-molybdate solution to react for color development was added, after which the production of inorganic phosphate was determined colorimetrically at 625 nm using a kinetic microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity was measured by subtracting the activity at pCa 4.0 from the activity at pCa 8.0. In Vivo Catheterization and Hemodynamic Studies—Assessment of left ventricular (LV) function in the intact animal was performed essentially as previously described (21Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were anesthetized with ketamine-thiobutabarbital, and following tracheotomy (PE-90), the right femoral artery and vein were cannulated with polyethylene tubing for measuring systemic arterial pressure and for the infusion of experimental drugs. To assess myocardial performance, a 1.4F Millar Mikro-Tip transducer (Millar Instruments) was inserted in the right carotid artery and advanced into the LV for pressure measurement and determining dP/dt. Cardiovascular responses to increasing doses of dobutamine were determined during 3-min constant infusions (0.1 μl/min/g body weight), and average values were determined during the final 30 s of each infusion. At the end of each dose response protocol, a bolus dose of propranolol (100 ng/g body weight) was administered to evaluate base-line cardiac function in the absence of endogenous β-adrenergic activity. In separate experiments designed to assess the phosphorylation status of Ca2+-handling proteins and contractile proteins during adrenergic stimulation in the cTnI-AllP mice, a maximum dobutamine dose of 32 ng/g body weight was infused, responses were monitored for 3 min, and the hearts were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Myofibrillar proteins were prepared, and the phosphorylation status was analyzed on two-dimensional gels. Arterial blood pressure was determined by tail cuff measurement of nonsedated 12-week-old mice using a Visitech Systems (Apex, NC) Bp-2000 system. Closed chest invasive hemodynamic studies for force frequency relations were performed under ketamine/thiobutabarbital anesthesia. LV function was measured as above. Atrial pacing was accomplished using a 0.3-mm bipolar electrode placed at the wall of the right atrium via the right jugular vein. After base-line hemodynamic data were acquired, atrial pacing was instituted to overdrive the intrinsic heart rate (350-700 bpm) and, unless stated otherwise, maintained at a constant rate of 7.5 Hz (450 bpm) (22D'Angelo D.D. Sakata Y. Lorenz J.N. Boivin G.P. Walsh R.A. Liggett S.B. Dorn II, G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8121-8126Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Data were collected and analyzed using a PowerLab system (AD Instruments, Colorado Springs, CO). NMR Spectroscopy—Full-length cDNA encoding mouse cTnI-WT and cTnI-AllP were generated by PCR and subcloned into the pET23a+ expression vector (Novagen). [15N,2H]cTnC, cTnI-WT, cTnI-AllP, and cTnI-PP proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified, and complex formation was carried out as described (23Finley N. Abbott M.B. Abusamhadneh E.

Composite amide chemical shift differences were determined from the square root of the weighted sum of the squares of proton and nitrogen chemical shift differences. 15N chemical shift differences were weighted by a factor of one-seventh to scale their contributions to a magnitude similar to 1H chemical shift differences and the data processed as described (24Gaponenko V. Abusamhadneh E. Abbott M.B. Finley N. Gasmi-Seabrook G. Solaro R.J. Rance M. Rosevear P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16681-16684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The structural effects of PKA phosphorylation at Ser23/Ser24 of cTnI on cTnC conformation have been reported previously (23Finley N. Abbott M.B. Abusamhadneh E. Gaponenko V. Dong W. Gasmi-Seabrook G.

Data were analyzed by fitting the data obtained for each individual and then averaging the derived Hill parameters. The Ca2+ sensitivities of Mg2+-ATPase activities were determined by fitting normalized Mg2+-ATPase activity-pCa curves with a Hill equation for a general cooperative model for substrate as the built-in Hill function in the Origin 7.5 NLSF tool (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA) using nonlinear regression analysis with the expression, y=Vmax×Ca2+n/(EC50n+Ca2+n)), where Vmax represents maximum activity, EC50 is the [Ca2+] at which 50% of maximum activity was produced, and Ca2+ is the substrate concentration. The steepness of the transition to maximal activation (n) is a measure of the cooperativity of the relation (i.e. Hill coefficient). The minimum and maximum Mg2+-ATPase and pCa50 activities were used as an index of myofibrillar Ca2+ sensitivity, and the Hill coefficient was used as an index of cooperative activation of the myofibrillar proteins. EC50 values were reported as pCa50, where pCa50=−logEC50. Comparisons between NTG and either cTnI-AllP or cTnI-PP TG littermates were evaluated using Student's t test, with significance defined as p < 0.05 using a two-tailed unpaired t test.

However, most of the data bearing on the functional outcome(s) of phosphorylation, with rare exceptions (28Takimoto E. Soergel D.G. Janssen P.M. Stull L.B. Kass D.A. Murphy A.M. Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 496-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 29Pi Y. Zhang D. Kemnitz K.R. Wang H. Walker J.W. J.

To investigate the role of cTnI phosphorylation in cardiac function, we generated two sets of mice in which either the PKA sites (cTnI-PP) or PKA and PKC sites (cTnI-AllP) were altered, allowing us to determine the additive and potential antithetic effects of the two on in vivo hemodynamics and the force-frequency response. The cardiac isoform of TnI contains a unique 32-amino acid sequence at the N terminus, in which two serines at residues 23 and 24 are substrates for PKA. Whereas Ser43/Ser45 and Thr144 are phosphorylated by PKC (Fig. 1A), it is well documented that PKC can cross-phosphorylate the PKA sites as well (6Noland Jr., T.A. Guo X. Raynor R.L. Jideama N.M.

Therefore, to rigorously explore the long term effects of chronic β-adrenergic stimulation, the five sites that can be phosphorylated by PKA and/or PKC were mutated to aspartic acid to mimic the fully charged state of cTnI (Fig. 1A). This transgene was termed cTnI-AllP. To compare and contrast the in vivo effects of PKA-mediated phosphorylation in the absence of PKC-induced modification of cTnI, we generated another construct (cTnI-PP) in which only the PKA phosphorylation sites of cTnI (Ser23/Ser24) were mutated to aspartic acid (Fig. 1A). Each cDNA was then linked to the mouse α-myosin heavy chain promoter and used to generate TG mice. Lines in which replacement was essentially complete were generated with both constructs (Fig. 1, B-E), with replacement confirmed either by SDS-PAGE and Western blots (lane 112; cTnI-AllP) or MALDI-TOF 2S. M. Helmke, S. Sakthivel, M. W. Duncan, and J. Robbins, unpublished data. (lanes 112 and 62; cTnI-AllP and cTnI-PP, respectively). As described for other contractile proteins, increases observed at the RNA level are not translated into absolute increases of protein (20Krenz M. Sanbe A. Bouyer-Dalloz F. Gulick J. Klevitsky R. Hewett T.E. Osinska H.E. Lorenz J.N. Brosseau C. Federico A. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. Perryman M.B. Helmke S.M. Robbins J. J. Biol.

Rather, levels of the endogenous protein are reduced such that contractile protein stoichiometry is conserved, resulting in replacement of the endogenous protein with the transgenically encoded species. The degree of cTnI-AllP replacement was confirmed by Western blot analyses using a cTnI antibody that recognizes both the endogenous and TG species (Fig. 1C) with line 112 (cTnI-AllP). For cTnI-PP, which could not be resolved from endogenous cTnI on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1D), MALDI-TOF showed greater than 95% replacement. 2S. M. Helmke, S. Sakthivel, M. W. Duncan, and J. Robbins, unpublished data. Lines 112 and 62 were chosen for detailed analyses on the basis of essentially complete replacement of endogenous cTnI with the TG species. Both the cTnI-AllP and cTnI-PP proteins were incorporated normally into the sarcomere (Fig. 2A). Heart/body weight ratios did not differ between NTG (0.0053 ± 0.0008, n = 36) and cTnI-AllP (0.0057 ± 0.0007, n = 28, p = 0.07) or NTG (0.00525 ± 0.0005, n = 18) and cTnI-PP (0.0054 ± 0.0008, n = 15, p = 0.41) littermates.

https://openalex.org/W1996081226,"Modulation of stem cell differentiation is an important assignment for cellular engineering. Embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but the efficiency is typically low. Here, we show that exposure of mouse ES cells to extremely low frequency magnetic fields triggered the expression of GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5, acting as cardiac lineage-promoting genes in different animal species, including humans. Magnetic fields also enhanced prodynorphin gene expression, and the synthesis and secretion of dynorphin B, an endorphin playing a major role in cardiogenesis. These effects occurred at the transcriptional level and ultimately ensued into a remarkable increase in the yield of ES-derived cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate the potential use of magnetic fields for modifying the gene program of cardiac differentiation in ES cells without the aid of gene transfer technologies and may pave the way for novel approaches in tissue engineering and cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1986105957,"The mechanism by which mutated copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) causes familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is believed to involve an adverse gain of function, independent of the physiological antioxidant enzymatic properties of SOD1. In this study, we have observed that mutant SOD1 (G41S, G85A, and G93A) but not the wild type significantly reduced the stability of the low molecular weight neurofilament mRNA in a dosage-dependent manner. We have also demonstrated that mutant SOD1 but not the wild type bound directly to the neurofilament mRNA 3′-untranslated region and that the binding was necessary to induce mRNA destabilization. These observations provide an explanation for a novel gain of function in which mutant SOD1 expression in motor neurons alters an intermediate filament protein expression. The mechanism by which mutated copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) causes familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is believed to involve an adverse gain of function, independent of the physiological antioxidant enzymatic properties of SOD1. In this study, we have observed that mutant SOD1 (G41S, G85A, and G93A) but not the wild type significantly reduced the stability of the low molecular weight neurofilament mRNA in a dosage-dependent manner. We have also demonstrated that mutant SOD1 but not the wild type bound directly to the neurofilament mRNA 3′-untranslated region and that the binding was necessary to induce mRNA destabilization. These observations provide an explanation for a novel gain of function in which mutant SOD1 expression in motor neurons alters an intermediate filament protein expression.

The demonstration of a genetic linkage between mutations in the SOD1 gene and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis aroused interest in the role of SOD1 in motor neuron death (3Rosen D.R.

A gain of function to the SOD1 enzyme, conferred by the mutation, remains a potential mechanism for this toxicity. Supporting this concept are the observations that many SOD1 mutants maintain normal enzymatic function (4Borchelt D.R. Lee M.K. Slunt H.S. Guarnieri M. Xu Z.S. Wong P.C. Brown Jr., R.H. Price D.L.

It was also shown that SOD1G93A but not WT co-localizes with neurofilamentous aggregates induced by low molecular weight neurofilament (NFL) overexpression in transfected Neuro2A cells (7Lin H. Zhai J. Cañete-Soler R. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 2716-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Neuropathological hallmarks of ALS include the degeneration of the descending corticospinal tracts and spinal, bulbar, and cortical motor neurons (8Strong M.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 98: 379-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In the latter nerves, degenerating neurons characteristically contain a variety of inclusions, including neurofilamentous aggregates. Such neurofilamentous aggregates have been observed in a number of transgenic mouse models of motor neuron degeneration in which the stoichiometry of expression of the individual neurofilament (NF) subunits has been altered. These include alterations in the level of expression of each of the neurofilament subunit proteins (NFL and middle and high molecular weight neurofilaments) (9Xu Z. Cork L.C. Griffin J.W.

We observed recently (16Ge W. Leystra-Lantz C. Wen W. Strong M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26558-26563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that the stability of human NFL (hNFL) mRNA was determined through mRNA-binding proteins interacting with the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of the hNFL mRNA and that these binding proteins were expressed differentially between control and ALS-derived spinal cord homogenates. It has been reported (15Menzies F.M. Grierson A.J. Cookson M.R. Heath P.R. Tomkins J. Figlewicz D.A. Ince P.G. Shaw P.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) that the transfected human SOD1G93A significantly deregulates steady state mRNA levels of NFL in the motor neuron hybridoma cell line (NSC34). The results suggest that the mutant SOD1 is associated directly with an alteration in the stoichiometry of NF expression, providing a link between mutant SOD1 and the formation of NF aggregates. In the present studies, we found that mutant SOD1 but not WT bound directly to hNFL mRNA on its 3′-UTR and led to an enhanced rate of mRNA degradation. This is the first report of mutant SOD1 functioning as a trans-acting mRNA-binding protein, which provides a novel gain of function for mutant SOD1 that leads directly to an alteration of neurofilament mRNA stoichiometry. Cell Culture and Transfection—NSC34 cells were grown as suggested previously (17Cashman N.R. Durham H. Blusztajn J.K. Oda K. Tabira T. Shaw I.T. Dahrouge S. Antel J.P. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) and transfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stable transfections were selected by the constant presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) and screened for high level expression using immunoblotting. Cloning and Expression of hNFL Genes—Because of the limitations in the length of an RNA probe for RNA-protein binding assays, the last 1000 nt of hNFL mRNA, including the 3′-untranslated region (hNFL-1000), which contains the putative major stability regulatory elements (18Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12650-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was RT-PCR amplified from an ALS patient RNA sample and cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) as the representative for the full-length hNFL (16Ge W. Leystra-Lantz C. Wen W. Strong M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26558-26563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). hNFL cDNA devoid of the 3′-untranslated region (hNFL-CDS) was also amplified and cloned. SYBR Green Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Relative quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green method. By adopting one primer from the vector sequence, transfected hNFLs was differentiated from the endogenous homologous murine NFL gene. Establishment of Tetracycline Tightly Controlled SOD1 Expression in the NSC34 Cell Line—First, NSC34 cells were transfected with pTet-Off vector (Clontech) and selected by the constant presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin. Colonies with a high expression level of tTA were screened indirectly by measuring neomycin resistance gene expression with real time PCR. pTRE2 (Clontech) constructs with WT or G93A SOD1 coding regions were transfected subsequently into these selected colonies together with pTK-Hyg (Clontech) and selected by the constant presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin and 150 μg/ml hygromycin B (Sigma). Tet-responsive suppression of SOD1 by doxycycline (Clontech) was monitored by using real time PCR assays and comparing the human SOD1 mRNA level from cultures with or without 2 μg/ml doxycycline. Protein Homogenate Preparation—Protein homogenates were extracted from cultured cells by passing cells through a QiaShredder column (Qiagen, Mississauga, Canada) in 500 μl of cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablet (Roche Diagnostics)). Immuno- and North-Western Blotting—Proteins were separated on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose filter. In the immunoblotting assay, membranes were incubated for 1 h in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20, 5% nonfat dry milk) and then further incubated with 1:2000-diluted rabbit polyclonal antibodies against SOD1 (StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada) for 1 h. Blots were then rinsed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated for 1 h with 1:1000-diluted swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) as secondary antibodies. Western lightning chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for colorimetric detection. For North-Western blotting, membranes were washed three times for 20 min each in Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1× Denhardt's reagent). Blotted proteins were probed by incubating with 105 cpm gel-recovered 32P-labeled transcripts in Buffer A for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed three times for 2 min each with Buffer A, air-dried, and autoradiographed. Gel Shift, Supershift, and Cross-link Assays—For the supershift assays, some protein homogenates were incubated with anti-SOD1 antibody for 10 min at room temperature. Other protein homogenates were mixed directly with 5.0 × 104 cpm 32P-labeled RNA probe in 20 μl of RNA binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol) at room temperature for 10 min, digested with 2 units of DNase I for 10 min, loaded with 5 μl of heparin (50 mg/ml in 50% glycerol) onto 5% native PAGE, and run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA at 100 V for 1 h. For cross-link assays, samples were placed in microtiter wells placed on ice and UV cross-linked for 10 min in a Stratalinker chamber (Stratagene) at a 250-mJ energy level. Mixtures were further digested with 10 units of RNase T1 at room temperature for 10 min, mixed with SDS loading buffer, and boiled before being loaded onto 12% SDS-PAGE. Flow Cytometry—Transfected NSC34 cells (1.0 × 106) were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% fetal bovine serum, and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan™ and CELLQuest™ software, BD Biosciences). eGFP fluorescence was detected on the FL1 channel (emission λ = 519 nm). Mutant SOD1 Destabilizes hNFL mRNA—We developed stable transfections of the NSC34 cells with wtSOD1, SOD1G41S, SOD1G93A, or with pcDNA3.1(+) vector only. These cell lines were further transfected transiently with pcDNA/hNFL-1000 together with pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) (the latter served as a normalizing control for transfection efficiency when checked with flow cytometry). No significant difference was observed in transfection efficiency among different stably transfected NSC34 cells (data not shown). Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen). Actin mRNA levels were used as the normalizing control for equal starting amounts of material. hNFL mRNA levels were reduced significantly in SOD1G41S- or SOD1G93A-transfected NSC34 cells compared with those in wtSOD1 or vector-transfected (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). To determine whether this reflected an effect on the stability of hNFL mRNA as opposed to an alteration in transcriptional activity, we then suppressed RNA synthesis by adding 1 mg/ml actinomycin D. Stably transfected SOD1 NSC34 cells were further transfected with pcDNA/hNFL-1000 for 24 h, and actinomycin D was added for the indicated period of time. hNFL mRNA levels were measured using real time PCR (Fig. 1B). hNFL mRNA demonstrated a more rapid decay in the presence of mutant SOD1 (G41S and G93A) than with WT (p < 0.01). We also used a tetracycline-controlled SOD1 expression system to further demonstrate the dosage-dependent destabilization of mutant SOD1 on hNFL mRNA. The expression of heterogeneous WT or G93A SOD1 was inhibited by the presence of 2 μg/ml doxycycline and further transfected with pcDNA/hNFL-1000. After 12 h, cells were detached and suspended in fresh medium in 4 wells of a 6-well plate. The final concentration of doxycycline for each well was adjusted to 2, 1, 0.5, and 0 μg/ml, respectively. Cells were harvested after 24 h, homogenized, and divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel for protein level detection by anti-SOD1 Western blot (Fig. 2A), and the other was used for total RNA extraction and real time PCR to check the hNFL mRNA level. The hNFL mRNA amount was plotted against the corresponding SOD1 protein level (Fig. 2B), revealing that the level of hNFL mRNA was irrelevant to the levels of co-expressed human WT SOD1 protein levels, it decreased continuously with the increasing level of SOD1G93A protein. The results are representative of three independent replications. Mutant SOD1 Binds hNFL mRNA Directly and within Its 3′-UTR—The wtSOD1, SOD1G41S, SOD1G85A, or SOD1G93A cDNA was cloned in-frame into pHM6 plasmid, producing hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged SOD1 proteins on transfection of the NSC34 cells, which were co-transfected with pcDNA/hNFL-1000. Protein was extracted 24 h after transfection and mixed with anti-HA affinity matrix (overnight at 4 °C), and HA-tagged SOD1 protein was immunoprecipitated. Following washing with lysis buffer, binding elements to SOD1 protein were released from the agarose beads by boiling and centrifugation. The supernatant was then used as the template for reverse transcription and real time PCR to quantify the levels of hNFL mRNA that had been co-precipitated with HA-tagged SOD1 protein. When it was normalized to the HA-SOD1 protein level, as assessed by anti-SOD1 immunoblotting (Fig. 3A), we observed that mutant SOD1 (G41S, G85A, and G93A) had significantly higher affinity in binding hNFL mRNA compared with the WT (Fig. 3B). We further examined the binding by UV cross-linking (Fig. 4A), gel shift, and supershift assays (Fig. 4B) and observed the loss of the initial binding band in the supershift assay with the presence of anti-SOD1 antibody but no predicted supershifted band from the incorporation of the antibody. It is possible that the binding sites for hNFL mRNA on the SOD1 protein may have been blocked by antibody, thus entirely eliminating the probe binding.Fig. 4Mutant SOD1 (G41S or G93A) binds directly to human hNFL mRNA. A, UV cross-link assays showing the formation of a binding complex (arrow) on 32P-labeled hNFL mRNA probe from mutant but not WT human SOD1-transfected NSC34 homogenates. B, to confirm the involvement of SOD1 protein in the binding complex, NSC34 protein homogenates were incubated with hNFL RNA probe with or without prior incubations with anti-SOD1 antibody (supershift assay). In the presence of the antibody, the intensity of the initial binding banding (arrow) was reduced dramatically.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The major ribonucleoprotein binding and regulatory sequence on murine NFL mRNA is located in the 3′-UTR of the mRNA (18Cañete-Soler R.

We assessed this possibility with North-Western blotting (Fig. 5A), using radiolabeled hNFL-1000 and hNFL-CDS RNA probe and observed a significant reduction in the affinity of hNFL mRNA without 3′-UTR to mutant SOD1 proteins. Densitometry results (Fig. 5B) suggested that the locations of the major binding sites for mutant SOD1 on hNFL mRNA were in the 3′-untranslated region. Similar results were obtained from three independent replications. Mutant SOD1 Destabilizes the hNFL mRNA through Its 3′-UTR—To demonstrate that the binding on its 3′-UTR by mutant SOD1 causes the instability of hNFL mRNA, we cloned hNFL 3′-UTR after a stop codon 3′ to the green fluorescence protein gene in pEGFP-C1 vector and transfected the construction into stably transfected SOD1 NSC34 cells. An irrelevant sequence of the same length was amplified from an ampicillin resistance gene complementary sequence on pcDNA3.1(+) vector and cloned as a scramble sequence after a stop codon 3′ to green fluorescence gene in pEGFP-C1 vector, serving as a negative control. Wild type, G41S, or G93A SOD1 stably transfected NSC34 cells were further transiently transfected with pEGFP/hNFL-3′-UTR or pEGFP/scramble. Cells were harvested 24 h after transfection, and the expression of eGFP reporter gene was measured with flow cytometry (Fig. 6A). Median values of green fluorescence intensity (Fig. 6B) showed that the expression of the eGFP reporter gene tagged with 3′-UTR of hNFL mRNA was reduced significantly with the presence of mutant SOD1 (G41S or G93A) compared with WT. In contrast, the expression of reporter eGFP gene tagged with scramble sequence stayed steady regardless of the presence of either WT or mutant SOD1. The results shown were representative of three independent replicas. Our experiments demonstratedfor the first time that mutant SOD1 but not WT interacts directly with hNFL mRNA and functions as a trans-acting hNFL mRNA stability determinant acting within the 3′-UTR. This suggests a novel gain of adverse function of mutant SOD1 in type I familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and provides an explanation for the reduced levels of NFL mRNA observed in lumbar spinal cord motor neurons in human familial ALS expressing mutant SOD1 (15Menzies F.M. Grierson A.J. Cookson M.R. Heath P.R. Tomkins J. Figlewicz D.A. Ince P.G. Shaw P.J. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 1118-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by providing a direct linkage between mutant SOD1 expression and the destabilization of the NFL mRNA. The role for such regulatory proteins in modulating NF mRNA stability has been well established. Murine NFL mRNA cis-acting elements are present in the 3′-coding region (3′-CR) and 3′-UTR of the NFL mRNA (18Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12650-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 19Cañete-Soler R. Schwartz M.L. Hua Y. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol.

Deletion of the 3′-UTR or 527 nt of the 3′-CR increased the stability of murine NFL mRNA compared with the full-length transcript in cell lines. Deletion of both the 3′-UTR and 3′-CR led to a further stabilization of the transcript. A major stability determinant was then localized to a 68-nt sequence that forms the junction between the 3′-CR and 3′-UTR of NFL. The regulation of the stability of labile mRNAs through unique trans-acting binding proteins is recognized increasingly as a key pathway in the regulation of gene expression. For instance, the stability of both c-myc and c-fos is modulated by the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes between AU-rich cis elements and cellular RNA binding factors (20Shaw G. Kamen R.A.

Neuron-specific AU-rich cis element-binding proteins, including HuD, HuC, and HuR, have been shown to bind with high affinity to AU-rich cis elements of mRNA involved in cellular growth and differentiation (23Manohar C.F.

HuD regulates the stability of the microtubule protein tau mRNA (24Aranada-Abreu G. Behar L. Chung S. Furneaux H. Ginzburg I. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6907-6917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) such that the treatment of PC12 cells with antisense oligonucleotide to HuD inhibits NGF differentiation and neuritic outgrowth. HuR, the ubiquitous embryonic lethal abnormal vision (ELAV) member, has been shown to modulate the stability of mRNAs involved in cell growth and angiogenesis, including interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor-α, and vascular endothelial growth factor (25Nabors L.B.

Multiple trans-acting binding protein factors to the murine major NFL mRNA stability determinant region were then identified by screening the rat brain cDNA expression library with the 68-nt RNA as a probe. Among factors with binding affinity to the probe is the p190RhoGEF (29Cañete-Soler R. Wu J. Zhai J. Shamim M. Schlaepfer W.W. J. Biol.

It has a highly interactive C-terminal domain, providing potential connections to multiple pathways in the cell. p190RhoGEF has been shown to bind to an untranslated, differentiated neuron-specific BC1 RNA (30Ge W.

The consequences of mutant but not WT SOD1 protein altering the stability of the NFL mRNA remain to be defined. Although the most obvious consequence of this process would be to alter the stoichiometry of NF protein expression in a fashion known to be associated with both ALS and motor neuron degeneration, the reduction in NFL mRNA may also have indirect effects. In this case, by reducing the abundance of hNFL mRNA because of the direct destabilization of the mRNA, higher levels of endogenous free binding factors that would otherwise have bound to the available mRNA could be induced. Alternatively, the binding of mutant SOD1 itself to hNFL mRNA may induce the release of competing trans-acting binding factors such as p190RhoGEF from hNFL mRNA. In both of these postulates, mutant SOD1 may potentially alter the availability of these RNA binding factors to interact with other binding targets. This effect, termed a “transdominant effect,” is exemplified by myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) (33Ranum L.P. Day J.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2004; 74: 793-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). DM1 is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in adults and is dominantly inherited. The mutation responsible for DM1 is a CTG expansion located in the 3′-UTR of the dystrophia myotonica-protein kinase gene (DMPK) (34Fu Y.H. Pizzuti A. Fenwick Jr., R.G. King J. Rajnarayan S.

It has been reported that mutant DMPK RNA binds and sequesters up to 90% of the observed transcription factors, leading to a subsequent reduction in the expression of multiple genes, including the ion transporter CIC-1 that has been implicated in myotonia (42Ebralidze A. Wang Y. Petkova V. Ebralidse K. Junghans R.P. Science. 2004; 303: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this case, the transcription factors sequestered by mutant DMPK mRNA are transdominant mediators. This hypothesis of a transdominant effect for mutant SOD1 could have an additional advantage in explaining the preferential vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS, despite the ubiquitous expression of the mutant SOD1, because the ultimate damage may be mediated by interacting binding factors and not by the mutant SOD1 itself. Both BC1 RNA and p190RhoGEF could be considered candidates for this purpose because both have neuron-specific expression. Experiments are currently in place to examine this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2028286264,"The E2A gene encodes DNA-binding transcription factors, called E12 and E47, involved in cell specification and maturation. E2A is also involved in a chromosomal translocation that leads to the expression of an oncogenic transcription factor called E2A-PBX1 in cases of acute leukemia. In the work described here, we elucidate the interaction between E2A-PBX1 and transcriptional co-activators. We confirm that the E2A portion can interact with CBP and PCAF and map required elements on E2A and CBP. On CBP, the interaction involves the KIX domain, a well characterized domain that mediates interactions with several other oncogenic transcription factors. On E2A, the interaction with CBP requires conserved α-helical domains that reside within activation domains 1 and 2 (AD1 and AD2, respectively). Using purified, recombinant proteins, we show that the E2A-CBP interaction is direct. Notwithstanding the previously demonstrated ability of AD1 and AD2 to function independently, some of our findings suggest functional cooperativity between these two domains. Finally, we show that the CBP/p300-interactive helical domains of E2A are important in the induction of proliferation in cultured primary bone marrow cells retrovirally transduced with E2A-PBX1.

Transcription factors encoded by the gene E2A are crucial for normal development and implicated in acute leukemia. E2A-null mice manifest a complete block of B-lymphoid development at the pro-B cell stage, prior to immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, and a propensity to develop T-lymphoblastic lymphoma (1Bain G.

Despite these particular defects in the lymphoid compartment, the E2A gene products, called E12 and E47 (or “E2A proteins” for simplicity) are expressed widely in tissues and appear to function more generally in cell type specification and maturation (4Rutherford M.N.

The E2A proteins belong to the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AD1, -2, activation domains 1 and 2; PCAF, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; IL-3, interleukin-3.1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; AD1, -2, activation domains 1 and 2; PCAF, p300/CREB-binding protein-associated factor; ALL, acute lymphoblastic leukemia; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FBS, fetal bovine serum; IMDM, Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium; IL-3, interleukin-3. class of transcription factors (6Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1373) Google Scholar). The bHLH domain, located toward the C terminus in E2A proteins, mediates dimerization and DNA binding (see Fig. 1). Dimerization is required for DNA binding by bHLH proteins. E2A proteins bind DNA at sites, called “E-boxes,” which contain the simple consensus sequence CANNTG. The widely expressed E2A proteins can heterodimerize with bHLH proteins whose expression is restricted to particular cell types to regulate target gene transcription in a tissue-specific manner. E2A proteins are transcriptional activators. Two activation domains have been mapped, largely using transient co-transfection of reporter plasmids with portions of E2A fused to heterologous DNA-binding domains (7Henthorn P. Kiledjian M. Kadesch T. Science. 1990; 247: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 8Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol.

A. 1993; 90: 8063-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation domain 1 (AD1) encompasses 99 amino acids at the extreme N terminus of the proteins, whereas activation domain 2 (AD2) is located more centrally (see Fig. 1). These domains are considered to function independently through distinct mechanisms. For example, whereas AD1 can trans-activate reporter genes in various cell types, AD2 is differentially active in cells of pancreatic β-cell origin (5Aronheim A. Shiran R. Rosen A. Walker M.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1601-1606Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activation domains mediate contacts between DNA-bound transcription factors and other proteins involved in gene transcription (10Naar A.M. Lemon B.D. Tjian R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 475-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). They can recruit large, multiprotein assemblies called transcriptional co-activator complexes. These often include proteins with intrinsic acetyltransferase activity. Acetyltransferases catalyze the acetylation of histones and other chromatin-associated proteins, including transcription factors. The mechanism by which acetylation of these proteins facilitates gene transcription is poorly understood and likely complex (11Felsenfeld G. Groudine M. Nature. 2003; 421: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). Among the best characterized transcriptional co-activator proteins are CREB binding protein (CBP) and its close paralog p300. CBP and p300 are large, ubiquitously expressed nuclear proteins (12Goodman R.H. Smolik S. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1553-1577PubMed Google Scholar). They were originally identified separately and are encoded on separate genes, but their polypeptide sequences are highly conserved; they are often referred to collectively as CBP/p300. Although lacking a DNA-binding domain, CBP/p300 can be recruited through protein-protein interactions to the promoters of target genes regulated by DNA-bound transcription factors. These include both oncogenic proteins, including c-Myb and c-Jun, and tumor suppressors such as p53 and pRb. The manner of involvement of CBP/p300 in oncogenesis appears complex and context-specific. PCAF, another well characterized and potent acetyltransferase, is an ortholog of the prototypic yeast acetyltransferase protein GCN5 (13Schiltz R.L. Nakatani Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M37-M53Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). PCAF exists as a stable complex with other proteins (the “PCAF complex”) and, like CBP/p300, can function as a transcriptional co-activator through transcription factor-dependent recruitment to target gene promoters. Furthermore, PCAF can associate directly with CBP/p300 and this probably contributes to its co-recruitment with CBP/p300 to some promoters. Functional and biochemical evidence indicates that E2A proteins can interact with CBP/p300. For example, p300, CBP, and PCAF can be co-immunoprecipitated with E2A proteins from crude nuclear extracts and co-elute with E2A proteins on fractionation of nuclear extracts by size exclusion chromatography (14Bradney C. Hjelmeland M. Komatsu Y. Yoshida M. Yao T.P. Zhuang Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2370-2376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The E2A locus on chromosome 19 is involved in at least two chromosomal translocations associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (15LeBrun D.P. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: S206-S222Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Translocation 1;19 creates the E2A-PBX1 fusion gene, which expresses chimeric, oncogenic proteins called E2A-PBX1a and E2A-PBX1b, in roughly 5% of cases of ALL (15LeBrun D.P. Front. Biosci. 2003; 8: S206-S222Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In these oncoproteins, the N-terminal two-thirds of E2A proteins, which includes AD1 and AD2, is fused to most of PBX1, including its homeodomain (Fig. 1). Considering this structural configuration, it has been proposed that E2A-PBX1 promotes oncogenic cell transformation through the aberrant transcriptional regulation of target genes that are normally regulated by PBX1-containing transcriptional regulatory complexes. Consistent with this hypothesis, reporter plasmids bearing consensus PBX1 binding sites are trans-activated by co-transfected E2A-PBX1, but not wild-type PBX1 proteins (16van Dijk M.A. Voorhoeve P.M. Murre C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6061-6065Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Lu Q. Wright D.D. Kamps M.P. Mol.

Furthermore, engineered deletions that impair trans-activation by E2A-PBX1, such as those that include AD1, also impair oncogenicity (19Monica K. LeBrun D.P. Dedera D.A. Brown R.B. Cleary M.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 8304-8314Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 20Kamps M.P. Wright D.D. Lu Q. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 19-30PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bayly R. LeBrun D.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 5789-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears likely that, as with transcriptional regulation by wild-type E2A proteins, neoplastic transformation by E2A-PBX1 relies on specific interactions of polypeptide elements in AD1 or AD2 with one or more transcriptional co-regulators. In the work described here, we elucidate functional interactions between the portion of E2A included in E2A-PBX1 (i.e. amino acids 1–483) and transcriptional co-activators. Our findings indicate that E2A can interact directly with the KIX domain of CBP. This interaction involves conserved helical domains within AD1 and AD2 and is associated with accelerated cell proliferation in retrovirally transduced primary hematopoietic progenitors. Plasmids—Plasmids conferring bacterial expression of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were constructed using PCR amplification. Plasmids containing the E2A-PBX1a and the murine CBP cDNAs were used as templates for the PCR. The PCR products were restriction-digested with BamHI and EcoRI (the appropriate restriction sites were included in the PCR primers) and ligated into the pGEX-2T bacterial expression plasmid in-frame with the GST open reading frame. All constructs made using PCR were sequenced to rule out the possibility of PCR-induced errors. Plasmids conferring mammalian expression of GAL4- or VP16-E2A fusion proteins were assembled by excising the various cDNAs from pGEX-2T and, using the BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites, ligating them into the pCVM1 mammalian expression plasmid in-frame with a portion of cDNA encoding the N-terminal 147 amino acids of GAL4 (i.e. the DNA-binding domain) or two VP16 activation domains arranged in tandem. The VP16 insert was generated by PCR from the plasmid “RSV-2X-VP16-Myb,” kindly provided by Dr. Paul Brindle. The reporter plasmid p5X GAL4 LUC was a generous gift from Dr. Cornelius Murre. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The expression plasmids based on pGEX-2T were transformed into competent Escherichia coli (strain BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RP, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by electroporation. Recombinant protein production was induced in 500 ml of exponentially growing cells by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm, and the cells were lysed 2.5 h later by sonication in 25 ml of phosphate-buffed saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, and the lysate was rocked gently at 4 °C for 30 min. Particulate material was pelleted by centrifugation, the supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 250 μl of pre-swollen glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) beads were added. The bead suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking and transferred to a chromatography column (Econo Column, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Ontario). The beads were washed with 40 bed volumes of 1% Triton X-100 in PBS and then with 20 bed volumes of PBS. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were eluted in 9 bed volumes of elution buffer (20 mm reduced glutathione, 75 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 100 mm NaCl) containing protease inhibitors. Eluate fractions containing protein were pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against PBS. The resulting solution was combined with an equal volume of 100% glycerol and stored in aliquots at –20 °C. The quantity and integrity of the GST fusion proteins was verified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels with comparison with known quantities of bovine serum albumin. Pull-downs, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—Nuclear extracts were prepared from RCH ACV cells using the Dignam and Roaeder method (22Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9150) Google Scholar). For pull-down experiments, 10 μg of GST fusion protein was combined with 20 μl of pre-swollen glutathione-Sepharose beads in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 to a final volume of 300 μl and rocked at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were then pelleted, washed in HEGN buffer (20 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) containing protease inhibitors, and nonspecific protein binding was blocked by incubation in HEGN buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1 m KCl. The beads were pelleted, resuspended in 350 μl of nuclear extract (containing roughly 3 mg/ml protein in HEGN buffer), and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The beads were pelleted and washed five times in HEGN buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. They were then resuspended, and the bound proteins were eluted in reduced glutathione. The eluate was combined with SDS-containing electrophoresis sample buffer (New England Biolabs, Mississauga, Ontario) in preparation for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. To immunoprecipitate purified GST fusion proteins, roughly 0.032 pmol of each protein was combined in 300 μl of HEGN buffer containing 0.1 m KCl and 4.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. A 100-fold molar excess of GST was added to block protein-protein interactions mediated by the GST portion of the recombinant proteins. After incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking, 10 μg of pre-swollen, pre-blocked protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added and the solution rocked for a further 2 h. Then, 1 μg of antibody was added, and the solution was rocked overnight. The beads were pelleted, washed three times in NNT wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 mm Tris, pH 8), and suspended in 40 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer. For immunoblotting, proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked by incubation for at least 1 h in PBS containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20 and then rocked overnight with the primary antibody in PBS containing 3% dried milk at 4 °C. The membrane was then washed and incubated with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h. After washing, the secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence, according to the manufacturer's instructions (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-CBP (CBP (C-1) monoclonal antibody and (A-22) polyclonal antiserum, Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), anti-E2A (yae monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-PCAF (a polyclonal antiserum kindly provided by Dr. Xiang-Jiao Yang, McGill University, Montreal, Canada), and anti-GAL4 (polyclonal antiserum, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transfections and Luciferase Assays—RCH ACV cells were propagated in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). For transient transfections, 1.5 × 107 cells in 400 μl of complete medium containing 20 μg of DNA (including 8 μg of expression plasmid (based on pCMV1), 8 μg of reporter plasmid (p5xGAL4 LUC), and 4 μg of a plasmid conferring constitutive expression of β-galactosidase) were placed in an electroporation cuvette (gap 0.4 cm) and subjected to an electrical pulse (260 V, 1050 microfarads) using a Gene Pulser II apparatus (Bio-Rad). Immediately thereafter, the cells were diluted into 5 ml of complete medium in 60-mm Petri dishes. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were carried out 18–24 h later using chemiluminescence reagents (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Each data point represents at least four transfections. The luciferase values were normalized to the β-galactosidase or Renilla luciferase values, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated. For the mammalian two-hybrid experiments, 104 HeLa cells were plated into each well of a 12-well plate in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS. The next day, the cells were transfected with mammalian expression and reporter plasmids (3.5 μg of pCMV-GAL4-CBP 586–673, 0.5 μg of pCMV-2xVP16-E2A, 2 μg of p5xGAL4 LUC, and 0.3 μg of PRL-CVM (a Renilla luciferase-expressing plasmid kindly provided by Dr. Chris Mueller)) using a liposome-based technique described previously (23St Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Park M. Casselman R. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41898-41905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed 40 h later in Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and a portion of the lysate was analyzed using Dual-Luciferase Assay reagents (Promega) and an LB96V MicroLumat Plus luminometer (EG & G Berthold Ltd., Bundoora, Australia). Retroviral Transductions and Immortalization Assays—Bone marrow was harvested on day 1 of the experiment from the femurs and tibia of five CD-1 mice at 12–14 weeks of age and placed in prestimulation mix (IMDM medium containing 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6, and 75 ng/ml murine stem cell factor; all recombinant cytokines were purchased from Peprotech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ). Retroviral packaging cells (293T) were co-transfected with MSCVneo (retroviral backbone) and MCV-ecopac (ecotropic packaging) plasmids by the calcium phosphate method in 100-mm Petri dishes. On day 2, the bone marrow cells were washed in IMDM containing 2% fetal calf serum and re-suspended in prestimulation mix. The packaging cells were exposed to 15 Gy of ionizing radiation and refed. The next day, the bone marrow cells were washed and split into the Petri dishes containing the packaging cells in fresh prestimulation mix containing Polybrene (8 μg/ml). On day 4, the bone marrow cells were washed again and re-plated on the packaging cells in fresh prestimulation mix with Polybrene. The next day, the bone marrow cells were washed and transferred to fresh, non-coated Petri dishes in fresh medium. On day 6, the cells were washed, re-suspended in IMDM containing 10% FBS, 10 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, and 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and monitored for growth (this is designated as “day 1” in the growth curves). The serial replating assay was performed essentially as described previously (24Lavau C. Szilvassy S.J. Slany R. Cleary M.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4226-4237Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Briefly, 104 retrovirally transduced cells were plated on day 1 in IMDM supplemented with 15% FBS, 10 ng/ml IL-3, 10 ng/ml IL-6, 10 ng/ml granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, 200 μg/ml transferrin (Sigma), and 1% methylcellulose (Stem Cell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada). Colonies containing at least 50 cells were counted after 6 or 7 days. The cells were then re-suspended, washed twice in 2× IMDM, counted, and 104 cells were re-plated in methylcellulose-containing medium for the next round in the experiment. The medium contained G418 (1.2 mg/ml) in the first plating only. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry was carried out as described previously (25Rutherford M.N. Bayly G.R. Matthews B.P. Okuda T. Dinjens W.M. Kondoh H. LeBrun D.P. Leukemia. 2001; 15: 362-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Oncogenic Portion of E2A Proteins Interacts with CBP— Motivated primarily by the consideration that interaction with transcriptional co-activators could play a role in leukemia induction, we set out to characterize the interaction between E2A-PBX1 and CBP/p300. To map CBP-interactive elements, we carried out pull-down experiments using portions of E2A-PBX1b expressed and purified as fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase. These were bound in equivalent quantities to glutathione-Sepharose beads and then mixed with nuclear extract prepared from the cell line RCH ACV. These cells were established from a case of ALL and are associated with t(1;19) and expression of endogenous E2A-PBX1. Proteins retained on the beads after washing were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with an anti-CBP monoclonal antibody. The results indicate that the oncogenic portion of E2A (i.e. E2A 1–483), which is invariant between E12 and E47, but not full-length PBX1a, is capable of interacting with CBP under the conditions of this experiment (Fig. 2B). Therefore, additional GST fusion proteins were designed to map CBP-interactive elements within the E2A portion of E2A-PBX1. E2A 1–273, which encompasses AD1 but excludes AD2, also retained considerable CBP, although substantially less than intact E2A 1–483; 10-fold dilution of the eluate from the E2A 1–483 pull-down indicated that E2A 1–273 retained roughly 20% of the CBP retained by the larger polypeptide (Fig. 2C). Deletion of the N-terminal 28 amino acids from E2A 1–273 (i.e. 29–273) completely abrogated the CBP interaction. Use of E2A 1–99 (i.e. isolated AD1) reduced the CBP interaction relative to E2A 1–273 but did not abrogate it. Therefore, the N-terminal 28 amino acids of AD1 are required for the CBP interaction in the context of E2A 1–273. E2A segment 274–483 (containing AD2 but not AD1) retained CBP but at barely detectable levels. E2A 1–483 retains considerably more CBP than is retained by the sum of the CBP retained by E2A 1–273 and E2A 274–483, suggesting a cooperative interaction between elements contained within these two protein segments. Interaction with CBP and PCAF Requires Conserved Helical Domains within AD1 and AD2 of E2A Proteins—Amino acids 11–28 of E2A are phylogenetically conserved and predicted to adopt a α-helical conformation (26Massari M.E. Jennings P.A. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This helical domain interacts with the SAGA transcriptional co-activator complex in yeast and is required in the transcriptional function of AD1. Our results suggested that the α-helical domain of AD1 would also be important for CBP recruitment in the context of E2A 1–483. Deletion of most of this domain (Δ16–23) in the context of E2A 1–483 drastically reduced, but did not abrogate, CBP recruitment in the pull-down assay (Fig. 2D). Therefore, we suspected that elements within AD2 might be compensating to some degree for the loss of the AD1 helical domain from E2A 1–483. Although no sequence conservation exists between the two E2A activation domains, AD2, like AD1, contains a short, conserved domain (residues 397–406) that is predicted to form a α-helix and required in the transcriptional function of AD2 (8Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Deletion of the AD2 helical domain (Δ397–405) reduced CBP recruitment slightly relative to wild-type E2A 1–483, whereas simultaneous deletion of both helical domains (Δ16–23/Δ397–405) completely abrogated the interaction of E2A 1–483 with CBP (Fig. 2D). Re-probing the same blot with a polyclonal antiserum against PCAF indicated recruitment of this protein by E2A 1–483, Δ16–23, and Δ397–405 in quantities that paralleled those of CBP. Although the quality of this blot is relatively poor, the result was reproducible in at least three experiments. Thus, in these experiments, helical domains within both AD1 and AD2 contribute to the recruitment of CBP and PCAF from lymphoid nuclear extract, although the AD1 helical domain makes a considerably greater contribution. E2A Interacts Directly with the KIX Domain of CBP—CBP is a large protein with multiple protein-protein interaction domains. To map E2A-interactive elements on CBP, GST fusion proteins were generated with contiguous or overlapping segments of murine CBP that collectively span the entire protein. These were used in pull-down experiments with RCH ACV nuclear extract; proteins retained on the beads were immunoblotted with an anti-E2A monoclonal antibody. Only one segment of CBP, extending from residue 461 to 915, retained E2A proteins beyond background level (Fig. 3B). This region contains the KIX domain (residues 586–666, also called the “CREB-binding domain”), a well characterized protein-protein interaction domain known to mediate interactions with multiple transcriptional activation domains, including the prototypic interaction with CREB (Fig. 3A) (27Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar, 28Parker D. Ferreri K. Nakajima T. LaMorte V.J. Evans R. Koerber S.C. Hoeger C. Montminy M.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 694-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We carried out additional pull-down assays to confirm interaction of E2A with the KIX domain of CBP. Deletion of the crucial α3 helix (residues 646–661) within the KIX domain in the context of the relatively large segment of CBP (residues 461–915) capable of interacting with E2A completely abrogated the interaction (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, a small segment of CBP (amino acids 586–673) incorporating the KIX domain with only seven additional, C-terminal amino acids was fully capable of interacting with E2A proteins. In some experiments, CBP 586–673 showed an apparent preference for interacting with wild-type E2A proteins relative to the fusion proteins (i.e. compare the intensities of the bands in the left and right panels of Fig. 3B). Under the conditions of these experiments, the KIX domain of CBP is required and sufficient to mediate the interaction with E2A proteins. CBP can interact with numerous proteins besides PCAF and E2A, raising the question as to whether the interaction with E2A is direct. Therefore, we attempted to reconstitute the interaction between E2A and CBP using purified, recombinant proteins. GST-E2A 1–483 was mixed in solution with GST-CBP 1–720 (a segment that includes the KIX domain), and immunoprecipitation was carried out using a polyclonal anti-serum directed against the N terminus of CBP. Subsequent immunoblotting of the precipitated proteins with an anti-E2A monoclonal antibody indicated co-precipitation of GST-E2A 1–483 (Fig. 4B). Under the conditions of these experiments, the α-helical domains within AD1 and AD2 of E2A appeared redundant for the CBP interaction, because deletion of either one had no observable effect upon co-immunoprecipitation of CBP. However, simultaneous deletion of both of these regions completely abrogated the CBP interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation of the E2A protein was not observed with GST-CBP 1–460, which lacks the KIX domain, or with an antiserum against the hemagglutinin epitope, which served as a negative control. Coomassie staining of a duplicate gel indicated equivalent loading of the various GST fusion proteins (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that E2A can interact directly with CBP without the participation of additional proteins. Furthermore, they suggest that both of the α-helical domains contained within AD1 and AD2 make direct contact with the KIX domain or elements in its immediate vicinity (i.e. within amino acid positions 461–720 of CBP). These results using purified proteins differ somewhat from those involving pull-down assays from crude nuclear extract. In the pull-down assays, the AD2 heli"

Toroviruses and group 2 coronaviruses bind to O-acetylated Sias, presumably via their spike proteins (S), whereas other glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin-esterases (HE), destroy Sia receptors by de-O-acetylation. Here, we present a comprehensive study of these enzymes. Sialate-9-O-acetylesterases specific for 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid, described for bovine and human coronaviruses, also occur in equine coronaviruses and in porcine toroviruses. Bovine toroviruses, however, express novel sialate-9-O-acetylesterases, which prefer the di-O-acetylated substrate 5-N-acetyl-7(8),9-di-O-acetylneuraminic acid. Whereas most rodent coronaviruses express sialate-4-O-acetylesterases, the HE of murine coronavirus DVIM cleaves 9-O-acetylated Sias. Under the premise that HE specificity reflects receptor usage, we propose that two types of Sias serve as initial attachment factors for coronaviruses in mice. There are striking parallels between orthomyxo- and nidovirus biology. Reminiscent of antigenic shifts in orthomyxoviruses, rodent coronaviruses exchanged S and HE sequences through recombination to extents not appreciated before. As for orthomyxovirus reassortants, the fitness of nidovirus recombinant offspring probably depends both on antigenic properties and on compatibility of receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities.

The first and arguably most critical step of any viral infection is the attachment of the virion to the host cell. The molecules to which virions bind comprise a diverse collection of cell surface proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates (1Smith A.E. Helenius A. Science. 2004; 304: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Quite a number of enteric and respiratory viruses use sialic acid (Sia) 1The abbreviations used are: Sia, sialic acid; αNeu4,5,9Ac32Me, 5-N-acetyl-4,9-di-O-acetylneuraminic acid α-methyl glycoside; BCoV, bovine coronavirus; BSM, bovine submaxillary mucin; BToV, bovine torovirus; Dss, distribution of synonymous substitutions; E, esterase domain; ECoV, equine coronavirus; F, fusion domain; HA, hemagglutinin; HCoV, human coronavirus; HE, hemagglutinin-esterase; HEF, hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein; Ks, synonymous substitutions per synonymous site; MHV, mouse hepatitis virus; NA, neuraminidase; Neu5Ac, 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5,9Ac2, 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu4,5Ac2, 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5,8Ac2, 5-N-acetyl-8-O-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5,7Ac2, 5-N-acetyl-7-O-acetylneuraminic acid; Neu5,7(8),9Ac3, 5-N-acetyl-7(8),9-di-O-acetylneuraminic acid; pNPA, p-nitrophenyl acetate; PToV, porcine torovirus; R, receptor-binding domain; RCoV-SDAV, rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus; RDE, receptor-destroying enzyme; S, spike; SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. either as their sole receptor or as an initial attachment factor (2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). Sialic acids, a generic name for a large family of 9-carbon negatively charged monosaccharides, typically occur as terminal residues of glycoconjugates. Of the variety of Sias that occur in nature, many result from differential O-acylation at C4, C7, C8, and C9 of the parental molecule 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) (2Angata T. Varki A. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 439-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 3Schauer R. Zoology. 2004; 107: 49-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Sias make ideal receptors because of their accessibility and abundance, but their wide distribution also has a downside. High avidity binding of virions to nonpermissive cells, to soluble sialylated compounds, or to sialylated mucins of the mucus barrier all might lead to loss of infectivity. In addition, loss of infectivity might result from virus self-aggregation. To ward against such hazards, some enveloped RNA viruses have developed an elegant strategy, which allows high affinity yet reversible binding to Sia receptors; they specify for virion-associated receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs). So far, two types of viral RDEs have been identified: sialidases (neuraminidases) and sialate-O-acetylesterases. RDEs with sialidase activity are found in para- and orthomyxoviruses (4Morrison T.G. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5Wagner R. Matrosovich M. Klenk H.D. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). For example, the orthomyxoviruses, influenza virus A and B, express two envelope glycoproteins: the hemagglutinin (HA), which mediates binding to Neu5Ac and subsequent fusion of viral and host cell membranes, and the neuraminidase (NA), which catalyzes the removal of Neu5Ac from sialoglycoconjugates. A functional balance between the antagonistic HA and NA activities is critical for efficient entry (5Wagner R. Matrosovich M. Klenk H.D. Rev. Med. Virol. 2002; 12: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The other type of RDE, sialate-O-acetylesterase, was first discovered in influenza C virus (6Herrler G. Rott R. Klenk H.D. Muller H.P. Shukla A.K. Schauer R. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1503-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 7Vlasak R. Krystal M. Nacht M. Palese P. Virology. 1987; 160: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This virus expresses only one envelope glycoprotein species, the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein (HEF), in which all three functions (receptor binding, RDE, and membrane fusion activity) are combined (7Vlasak R. Krystal M. Nacht M. Palese P. Virology. 1987; 160: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Herrler G. Durkop I. Becht H. Klenk H.D. J. Gen. Virol. 1988; 69: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The structure of the HEF spike, a homotrimer of a class I membrane glycoprotein, resembles that of HA of influenza virus A (9Rosenthal P.B. Zhang X. Formanowski F. Fitz W. Wong C.H. Meier-Ewert H. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Like the HA protein, the HEF protein is post-translationally cleaved. The N-terminal subunit, HEF1, forms the globular top part of the spike and contains the receptor-binding (R) and RDE esterase (E) domains; the C-terminal subunit HEF2, together with segments of HEF1, contains the fusion domain (F) and forms the large, membrane-anchored stalk (9Rosenthal P.B. Zhang X. Formanowski F. Fitz W. Wong C.H. Meier-Ewert H. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 92-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). HEF specifically recognizes 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) receptors, via a binding site at the tip of the globular head region. The catalytic pocket of the RDE constitutes a second Sia-binding site. The RDE, a serine hydrolase with a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, destroys Neu5,9Ac2 receptors by removing the 9-O-acetyl group (6Herrler G. Rott R. Klenk H.D. Muller H.P. Shukla A.K. Schauer R.

An RDE with sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity was recently discovered in infectious salmon anemia virus (genus Isavirus, family Orthomyxoviridae), a segmented negative-stranded RNA virus of teleosts (11Helleb ø A. Vilas U. Falk K. Vlasak R. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3055-3062Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). There is no obvious sequence identity between influenza C virus HEF and infectious salmon anemia virus hemagglutinin-esterase protein (HE), except for the regions that contain the catalytic residues (12Falk K. Aspehaug V. Vlasak R. Endresen C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 3063-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, influenza C virus HEF1 does share considerable identity with the nidovirus HEs (i.e. class I envelope glycoproteins expressed by toroviruses and certain coronaviruses) (13Luytjes W.

Coronaviruses and toroviruses (separate genera in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are evolutionarily related, enveloped (+)-strand RNA viruses of mammals and birds (17Snijder E.J. den Boon J.A.

All toroviruses identified so far carry an HE gene (20Smits S.L. Lavazza A. Matiz K. Horzinek M.C. Koopmans M.P. de Groot R.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9567-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), but among coronaviruses, only those belonging to (sub)group 2 do. The latter are exemplified by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). In SARS-associated human coronavirus (HCoV-SARS), which is an early phylogenetic split-off of group 2 (21Snijder E.J. Bredenbeek P.J. Dobbe J.C. Thiel V. Ziebuhr J. Poon L.L. Guan Y. Rozanov M. Spaan W.J. Gorbalenya A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 991-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (957) Google Scholar), and in group 1 and 3 coronaviruses, represented by porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and avian infectious bronchitis virus, respectively, the HE gene is absent. The role of the nidoviral HE proteins and their importance for viral replication is still subject to debate. In the case of BCoV, infection in the presence of esterase inhibitors results in reduced virus titers (22Vlasak R. Luytjes W. Leider J. Spaan W. Palese P. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4686-4690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HE-specific antibodies neutralize the virus (23Deregt D. Gifford G.A. Ijaz M.K. Watts T.C. Gilchrist J.E. Haines D.M. Babiuk L.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1989; 70: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Other observations, however, indicate that the HEs are nonessential for replication in tissue culture cells (24Gagneten S. Gout O. Dubois-Dalcq M. Rottier P. Rossen J. Holmes K.V. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 889-895Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Popova R. Zhang X. Virology. 2002; 294: 222-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In fact, during propagation in vitro of murine coronaviruses, HE expression is readily lost (13Luytjes W. Bredenbeek P.J.

Moreover, infection experiments with such HE-deficient MHV laboratory strains would suggest that, at least for these coronaviruses, the HE protein is also dispensable in vivo. Entry of coronaviruses and toroviruses (i.e. attachment and subsequent fusion of viral and host cell membranes) is mediated by the spike envelope glycoprotein S (27De Groot R.J. Van Leen R.W.

Plenum Press, New York1995: 73-113Crossref Google Scholar). MHV, HCoV-SARS, and group 1 coronaviruses, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and HCoV-229E use specific cell surface glycoproteins as their main receptor (29Williams R.K. Jiang G.S. Holmes K.V.

Contrary to what might be expected from their similarity to influenza C virus HEF or from their name, the coronaviral HEs seem to play only a minor role in viral attachment to Sias. Rather, the spike proteins appear to be the major Sia receptor-binding proteins (35Schultze B. Gross H.J. Brossmer R. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6232-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Wurzer W.J. Obojes K. Vlasak R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 39Kunkel F. Herrler G. Virology. 1993; 195: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Equine torovirus Berne, which lacks a functional HE gene, induces hemagglutination (40Zanoni R. Weiss M. Peterhans E. J. Gen. Virol. 1986; 67: 2485-2488Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), suggesting that toroviruses utilize Sia as an attachment factor as well and again implicating the S protein as the main candidate for Sia receptor binding. For all group 2 coronaviruses studied so far, the Sia receptor binding specificity of S matches the substrate preference of HE. For instance, BCoV and HCoV-OC43 specifically bind via their S proteins to glycosidically bound Neu5,9Ac2 moieties (35Schultze B. Gross H.J. Brossmer R. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6232-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Kunkel F. Herrler G. Virology. 1993; 195: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and, in accordance, encode HEs with sialate-9-O-acetylesterase activity (22Vlasak R. Luytjes W. Leider J. Spaan W. Palese P. J.

Likewise, MHV strain S binds to 5-N-acetyl-4-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu4,5Ac2) receptors apparently via its S protein and encodes an HE with sialate-4-O-acetylesterase activity (38Wurzer W.J. Obojes K. Vlasak R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Sialate-4-O-acetylesterases are also present in the closely related rodent coronavirus strains MHV-JHM and rat sialodacryoadenitis coronavirus (RCoV-SDAV) (16Klausegger A. Strobl B. Regl G. Kaser A.

Toroviruses and the group 2 coronaviruses apparently acquired their HE genes from an unknown source via independent heterologous RNA recombination events (13Luytjes W. Bredenbeek P.J. Noten A.F. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J. Virology. 1988; 166: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 14Snijder E.J. den Boon J.A. Horzinek M.C. Spaan W.J.

Virol. 1997; 71: 5277-5286Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conceivably, the acquisition of an HE protein increased viral fitness by allowing optimal usage of specific Sias as attachment factors. Still, our understanding of the evolution, function, and substrate specificities of the nidovirus HEs is incomplete. Both the toro- and the coronaviral HE genes have diverged considerably (20Smits S.L. Lavazza A. Matiz K. Horzinek M.C. Koopmans M.P. de Groot R.J. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 9567-9577Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 38Wurzer W.J. Obojes K. Vlasak R. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Coronavirus HEs have been described, which in their sequence are clearly distinct from those analyzed so far and for which the substrate specificity remains to be determined. With respect to the specificities of the toroviral HEs, no information is available at all. Here, we present a comprehensive study of nidovirus HE proteins based upon a combination of phylogenetic, biochemical, and molecular virological techniques. In addition to the sialate-9-O- and sialate-4-O-acetylesterases described so far, we report the identification of a novel type of HE, which occurs in bovine toroviruses (BToVs) and displays a preference for Sias with a di-O-acetylated glycerol side chain. We already noted that exchange of HE genes via homologous RNA recombination is common among toroviruses (20Smits S.L. Lavazza A. Matiz K. Horzinek M.C. Koopmans M.P. de Groot R.J. J.

We now show that naturally occurring rodent coronaviruses also exchange their HE as well as their S genes to an extent not appreciated before. At least on one occasion, this must have resulted not only in an antigenic shift but also in a shift in HE substrate specificity. The recombinational exchanges of surface glycoprotein genes in nidoviruses are reminiscent of the reassortment of HA and NA genome segments in influenza A and B viruses. Parallels between orthomyxo- and nidoviral biology with respect to attachment, envelope glycoprotein function, and consequences thereof are discussed. Phylogenetic Analyses—HE sequences were extracted from the NCBI data base for BToV strains Breda (BRV), B145 and B150 (accession numbers Y10866, AJ575379, and AJ575380), porcine torovirus (PToV) strains P-MAR, P10, and P4 (AJ575363, AJ575366, and AJ575364), MHV strains A59, JHM, and 2 (NC_001846, AAA46442, and AF201929), PuCoV (AJ005960), RCoV-SDAV (AF207551), equine coronavirus (ECoV)-NC99 (AY316300), BCoV-Mebus (U00735), HCoV-OC43 (OC43; M76373), PHEV (AY078417), and influenza C virus strains Miyagi/4/93 (C/MIY/4/93; BAB84727) and Johannesburg/66 (C/JHG/66; S07412). In MHV-A59 and MHV-2, the reading frames of the HE genes are interrupted by termination codons and, in the case of MHV-2, also interrupted by a 4-nucleotide deletion. To allow the inclusion of these strains in phylogenetic analyses, their HE genes were reconstructed in silico according to the MHV HE consensus sequence: MHV-A59, TGA (nucleotides 43–45) → GGA; MHV-2, TAA (nucleotides 292–294) → CAA; and insertion of the sequence AAAC at nucleotide position 525. Discrepancies were noted between sequences deposited for MHV-DVIM in the NCBI data base, indicating that virus stocks have been switched. The DVIM HE nucleotide sequence of Sugiyama et al. (AB008939) is 100% identical to the HE gene of MHV-S, as determined in our laboratory, 3A. Lissenberg and R. J. de Groot, unpublished observations; GenBank™ number AY771997. but only 73% identical to the DVIM HE sequence of Compton and Moore (AF091734). We therefore characterized the MHV-DVIM variant of the Compton laboratory (kindly provided by Dr. S. R. Compton). Reverse transcription-PCR products, together spanning a 10.8-kb region comprising the 3′-end of ORF1b through the N gene, were cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and subjected to sequence analysis using the ABI Prism BigDye Terminators version 3.0 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems) and an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer. The nucleotide sequence, determined in both orientations and for each region on at least two independent clones, was deposited in the EMBL data base (AY771998). Throughout, we use “DVIM” to refer to the Compton variant. Amino acid alignments were generated with Multalin, employing the Dayhoff symbol comparison table, and refined manually. Gaps were excluded. Phylogenetic trees were created by the neighbor-joining method, implemented in the program MEGA version 2.1 (44Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4553) Google Scholar); the reliability of each interior branch was tested by bootstrap analysis with 1000 resamplings. The number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) was estimated by sliding window analysis for overlapping 500-nucleotide gene segments with a 250-nucleotide step size with the program K-Estimator (45Comeron J.M.

The HE gene of MHV-S was reverse transcription-PCR-amplified from total intracellular RNA, isolated from infected cells.2 cDNA clones of the HE genes of MHV-DVIM, ECoV-NC99, and BCoV Quebec (47Yoo D.

Brian, and A. A. Potter, respectively. The HE protein of BCoV Quebec differs from that of strain Mebus by a single substitution, Val103 → Leu, within a motif FYEGVN (residues 99–104), which is strictly conserved among nidovirus and influenza C virus O-acetylesterases; since this substitution might affect enzymatic activity, Leu103 was changed back to Val via site-directed mutagenesis. All HE genes were inserted into pBluescript vectors (Stratagene) downstream of the bacteriophage T7 RNA promoter, either as PCR amplicons generated with primer sets listed in Table I (ECoV, MHV-DVIM, and MHV-S) or by recloning restriction fragments from pcDNA3HE (BCoV) (47Yoo D.

J., and Balber, A. E. (1990) J. Protozool. 37, 219–224). Glycoproteins were solubilized from bloodstream form T. brucei cells in 8 m urea and 3% SDS and purified by ricin affinity chromatography. Essentially all binding of ricin to these glycoproteins was abrogated by treatment with peptide N-glycosidase, showing that the ricin ligands are attached to glycoproteins via N-glycosidic linkages to asparagine residues. Glycans released by peptide N-glycosidase were resolved by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration into two fractions: a low molecular mass mannose-rich fraction and a high molecular mass galactose and N-acetylglucosamine-rich fraction. The latter fraction was further separated by high pH anion exchange chromatography and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry, one- and two-dimensional NMR, electrospray mass spectrometry, and methylation linkage analysis. The high molecular mass ricin-binding N-glycans are based on a conventional Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Manβ1–4-GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc core structure and contain poly-N-acetyllactosamine chains. A significant proportion of these structures are extremely large and of unusual structure. They contain an average of 54 N-acetyllactosamine (Galβ1–4GlcNAc) repeats per glycan, linked mostly by -4GlcNAcβ1–6Galβ1-interrepeat linkages, with an average of one -4GlcNAcβ1–3(-4GlcNAcβ1–6)Galβ1- branch point in every six repeats. These structures, which also bind tomato lectin, are twice the size reported for the largest mammalian poly-N-acetyllactosamine N-linked glycans and also differ in their preponderance of -4GlcNAcβ1–6Galβ1- over -4GlcNacβ1–3Galβ1- interrepeat linkages. Molecular modeling suggests that -4GlcNAcβ1–6Galβ1- interrepeat linkages produce relatively compact structures that may give these giant N-linked glycans unique physicochemical properties.

Zitzmann N. Richardson J.M. Treumann A. Ferguson M.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Each trypanosome contains several hundred VSG genes that encode immunologically distinct molecules, and the host is unable to clear the infection because of antigenic variation (2Cross G.A.M.

The flagellar pocket, a deep invagination of the plasma membrane, is the only known site for endocytosis and the secretion of proteins from the parasite, and this organelle is also involved in the recycling/sorting of proteins to and from the cell surface (4Lee M.G.S.

This suggests that some components in the flagellar pocket are stage-specific and that this organelle plays a crucial role in general cellular function and pathogenesis (9Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W.

Despite the pivotal physiological role of the flagellar pocket in bloodstream form T. brucei, very little is known about its biochemical constituents. Although a small number of glycoproteins that reside in the flagellar pocket and lysosomal/endosomal system have been identified, very little is known about the fine chemical structures of their glycan moieties (16Alexander D.L.

Baber A.E. J. Protozool. 1990; 37: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and tomato lectin (19Nolan D.P. Geuskens M. Pays E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1169-1172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The binding of tomato lectin suggests the presence of linear poly-N-acetyllactosamine (poly-LacNAc) oligosaccharides (19Nolan D.P. Geuskens M. Pays E. Curr.

In mammalian systems, poly-LacNAc-containing glycans that bind tomato lectin occur both on cell surface and lysosomal membrane glycoproteins (22Carlsson S.R. Fukuda M. J. Biol.

Medium sized poly-LacNAc chains of this type (with up to 8 repeats) have been identified on certain type 2 VSGs of T. brucei (25Zamze S.E. Ashford D.A. Wooten E.W. Rademacher T.W. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20244-20261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin to understand the physiological role of the flagellar pocket in bloodstream form T. brucei, we decided to examine the ricin-binding glycoproteins in this organism. We report a procedure for extracting glycoproteins using ricin coupled to agarose and describe the unusual size and structure of poly-LacNAc glycans released by peptide N-glycosidase-F (PNGase-F). We also show the localization of ricin ligands in the trypanosome. The unique sizes and unusual structure of the poly-LacNAc chains are discussed. Extraction of Ricin-binding Glycoproteins, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—Bloodstream form T. brucei (strain 427, variant 117), were isolated from infected rats and purified over DEAE-cellulose (26Cross G.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Parasites were subjected to hypotonic lysis to release cytosolic components as well as the majority of the VSG coat as soluble form VSG (26Cross G.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The cell ghost pellets (1011 cell equivalents) were solubilized in 50 ml of 8 m urea, 3% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8. The SDS/urea extract was diluted 50 times in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 400 mm NaCl, and 0.8% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1% sodium azide) to allow affinity chromatography on ricin-agarose (Vector Laboratories). Ricin-coupled agarose (4-ml packed volume) was added to the suspension and rotated gently overnight at 4 °C. Ricin-agarose was recovered by gentle centrifugation and packed into a 15 × 1-cm column. The column was washed with 5 volumes of buffer A, and bound material was eluted with 30 mg/ml lactose and 30 mg/ml Gal in 4-fold diluted buffer A. Aliquots of the eluted fractions were separated on NuPAGE bis-Tris 4–12% gradient gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, glycoproteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond, Amersham Biosciences) at 45 mA for 1 h in a Hoefer SemiPhor semidry transfer unit. After blocking for 1 h in buffer B (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Nonidet P-40, and 0.25% bovine serum albumin) at room temperature, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated ricin (diluted 1:10,000 in buffer B) for 1 h. The membrane was washed three times in buffer B and twice with PBS. Visualization was by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Fractions containing ricin-binding glycoproteins were pooled, concentrated 5-fold using a centrifugal concentrator, and diafiltered against water to remove most of the lactose and Gal. The concentrated extract was stored at –20 °C before use. An aliquot of this concentrated extract was also separated on a NuPAGE bis-Tris 4–12% gradient gel and stained for carbohydrate by periodic acid-Schiff. After electrophoresis, the gel was rinsed with water and incubated with fixing solution (acetic acid/methanol/water; 10:35:25) for 20 min. The gel was washed three times (5 min each) with water and incubated with oxidation solution (1% sodium periodic acid in 3% acetic acid) for 30 min. The gel was washed three times (5 min each) with water and incubated for 1 h with Schiff's reagent (Sigma). Finally, the gel was incubated for 30 min with a reducing solution of 1% sodium metabisulfite and washed six times with water. N-Glycan Release and Purification—To release N-glycans from proteins, the ricin-binding glycoproteins from 1 × 1011 cells in ∼1.5 ml were treated with 7,000 units of PNGase-F (New England BioLabs) overnight at 37 °C. The PNGase-F-treated fraction was made 50 mm with respect to potassium acetate and left overnight at 4 °C to precipitate SDS from the buffer. Triton X-100 was exhaustively extracted from the supernatant with toluene (typically 15–20 extractions with 3 volumes of toluene). Traces of solvent were removed by evaporation with nitrogen, and precipitated deglycosylated proteins at the water/toluene interface were discarded by centrifugation. N-Glycans were freeze dried, redissolved in water, and applied to a Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration column (40 × 1 cm) eluted with water at 6 ml/h. Aliquots (10 μl) of 0.5-ml fractions were mixed with 200 pmol of scyllo-inositol and subjected to methanolysis, trimethylsilylation, and GC-MS monosaccharide composition analysis (27Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-203Google Scholar). Fractions that eluted in the void volume of the column, which contained mainly Gal and GlcNAc, were pooled and desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) eluted with Milli-Q water. This fraction, referred to as the “total poly-LacNAc fraction,” was further fractionated by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) using a Dionex CarboPac PA-100 column (4 × 250 mm). The column was equilibrated with 95% buffer A (100 mm NaOH) and 5% buffer B (380 mm sodium acetate in 100 mm NaOH) for 20 min at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. N-Glycans were separated using a linear gradient of 5–40% buffer B over 90 min at 0.6 ml/min. N-Glycans were detected with a pulse-amperiometric detector, and sodium ions were removed from the eluate using an on-line Dionex ARRS unit (27Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-203Google Scholar). Glycans were collected individually or in fractions at the detector outlet and desalted by passage through a column of 0.5 ml of Dowex AG 50-H+ over 0.5 ml of Dowex AG 3-OH– and elution with 4 ml of water. The eluates were freeze-dried and redissolved in water. The unresolved fraction at the end of the Dionex HPAEC gradient (see Fig. 3) is referred to as the “very large poly-LacNAc” (VLPL) fraction. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of N-Glycans—Aliquots (1 μl) of glycans resolved on Dionex HPAEC, desalted and redissolved in Milli-Q water, were mixed with 1 μl of acetonitrile containing 2% formic acid and loaded into nanospray tips (Micromass type F) for ES-MS and ES-MS/MS. Samples were analyzed in positive ion mode with capillary and cone voltages of 0.9 kV and 30 V, respectively, using a Micromass Quattro Ultima triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and/or a Micromass Q-Tof2 orthogonal quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). All spectra were collected and processed with MassLynx software. Methylation Linkage Analysis—Methylation linkage analysis was carried out on the VLPL fraction that eluted at the end of Dionex HPAEC gradient. Approximately 5 nmol of material was used for each methylation linkage analysis. Glycans were converted to constituent monosaccharides in the form of partially methylated alditol acetates (PMAAs) and analyzed by GC-MS, as described previously (27Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-203Google Scholar). To estimate the stoichiometry of the PMAAs, authentic standards (i.e. NA2 asialo-bi-biantennary N-linked glycan, lacto-N-neohexaose, galactotriose (Dextra) and Manα1–2Manα1–6(Galα1–6Galα1–3)Manα1–4AHM (28Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar)) with glycosidic bonds present in the VLPL fraction (i.e. 4-O-substituted-GlcNAc, terminal-Gal, 3-O-substituted-Gal, 6-O-substituted-Gal, 3,6-di-O-substituted-Gal, 2-O-substituted Man, 3,6-di-O-substituted-Man) were analyzed simultaneously to determine total ion current molar relative response factors for the different residue types. NMR Analysis of the VLPL Fraction—The VLPL fraction purified by Dionex HPAEC was dissolved in 2H2O and analyzed by one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR. All NMR spectra were acquired at a probe temperature of 298 K on a Bruker Avance spectrometer operating at 600 MHz for 1H. To assign the proton resonances, two-dimensional homonuclear correlation spectroscopy (COSY) and total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY), with a mixing time of 120 ms, were performed. In addition, rotating frame nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy (ROESY), with a mixing time of 300 ms, was carried out to determine the connections between carbohydrate residues. An estimate of the proportion of LacNAc repeats to core residues was obtained by integration of the anomeric protons in the one-dimensional NMR spectrum using the program XWIN-NMR (Bruker). Dynamic Light Scattering Analysis of the VLPL Fraction—The VLPL fraction was analyzed on a Proterion Corporation model 99E DynaPro instrument with MS800 optics fitted with a flow cell. Approximately 300 μl of 0.2-μm filtered sample was injected into the flow cell, and 20 acquisitions were recorded using the model for branched polysaccharides. Each acquisition was the average of five 1-s readings. Tomato Lectin Chromatography—Approximately 18 nmol of the total poly-LacNAc fraction that eluted in the void volume of the Bio-Gel P-4 column (see Fig. 2) were mixed with 4 ml (bed volume) of tomato lectin-agarose (Vector). The agarose was equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1% sodium azide), and the mixture was left to rotate gently overnight at 4 °C. The agarose was washed by centrifugation with 16 ml of equilibration buffer, and bound oligosaccharides were eluted using a mixture of chitooligosaccharides (20 mg/ml of tri-N-acetylchitotriose and tetra--N-acetylchitotetraose in buffer A). Glycans present in the flow-through, wash, and elution fractions were pooled separately and purified using a Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration column. Void volume fractions containing glycans were then desalted using a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and redissolved in Milli-Q water. The glycan content of the three different fractions was examined by GC-MS. Glycans present in the flow-through and wash fractions were examined by ES-MS to determine the nature of the structures that did not bind to tomato lectin. The glycans that were eluted from the tomato lectin-agarose were analyzed by Dionex HPAEC, as described above.Fig. 41H NMR spectra of the VLPL fraction.A, one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the VLPL fraction (sample 1) after exchange into 2H2O.

The parasites were air-dried on coverslips (13 mm) at room temperature, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4 °C, and then washed four times with PBS (Sigma). For visualization of ricin binding sites, fixed parasites were treated with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h to block nonspecific binding. Cells were stained with FITC/ricin (1/500) in PBS (with and without 30 mg/ml lactose and galactose) for 1 h and then washed six times with PBS. Specimens were mounted in Hydromount, and single optical sections were collected on a Zeiss 510 META confocal microscope (alpha-Plan-Fluor ×100). Molecular Modeling—A model of -4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-linked poly-LacNAc containing five LacNAc repeats was built in Insight (Accelrys). A series of 10 random geometries was then computed, and each was subjected to dynamic simulated annealing using Discover (Accelrys). Similarly, 10 random geometry models of -4GlcNAcβ1-6Galβ1-linked poly-LacNAc, also containing five LacNAc repeats, were generated and subjected to simulated annealing. Extraction of Ricin-binding Glycoproteins—To extract all types of membrane-associated glycoconjugates, osmotically lysed T. brucei cells were completely solubilized in 8 m urea and 3% SDS for 30 min before dilution of the extract and addition of ricin coupled to agarose. Rechromatography of the unbound fraction showed that the majority of the ricin-binding material was captured in the first round of chromatography (data not shown). The native glycoproteins eluted from the ricin-coupled agarose range in apparent molecular mass from 35 to more than 188 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Reduction with 1 m dithiothreitol resulted in the disappearance of bands over 188 kDa and the appearance of smaller molecular mass glycoproteins (Fig. 1A, lane 2), suggesting disulfide linkages between some of the constituent glycoproteins. PNGase-F digestion of the ricin-binding glycoproteins revealed that almost all of the ricin-binding glycans are N-linked structures (Fig. 1B). The remaining ricin binding band at about 50 kDa is most likely residual VSG, a proportion of which is known to express ricin-binding terminal β-galactosidase as a side chain on its glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (28Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 29Mehlert A. Richardson J.M. Ferguson M.A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 379-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Treatment of the PNGase-F-treated sample with ice-cold aqueous HF, which removes glycosylphosphatidylinositols from proteins (27Ferguson M.A.J. Turner A.J. Hooper N. Lipid Modification of Proteins: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1992: 191-203Google Scholar), abrogated ricin binding to this band (data not shown). The reduced sample was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE and periodic acid-Schiff staining for carbohydrate (Fig. 1C). The pattern of staining is similar to that of the ricin Western blot (Fig. 1A, lane 2 and Fig. 1B, lane 1) except that the band running below the 97 kDa molecular mass marker in the ricin blot is less pronounced in the periodic acid-Schiff stain, and the band at 35 kDa in the periodic acid-Schiff stain is not apparent in the ricin blot. Presumably, the former has a relatively high terminal β-galactose to total carbohydrate ratio, and the latter does not contain terminal β-galactose itself but copurifies with other ricin-binding glycoproteins. Glycoproteins from the supernatant of the osmotically lysed parasites were also purified using agarose-coupled ricin. However, this fraction contained mostly soluble form VSG, which is known to be released from the cell surface during osmotic lysis by enzymatic cleavage of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor (26Cross G.A.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1984; 24: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 28Ferguson M.A.J. Homans S.W. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Science. 1988; 239: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) and was not analyzed further. Purification of VLPL Glycans—N-Linked glycans released from the ricin-binding glycoproteins by PNGase-F were separated by Bio-Gel P-4 gel filtration chromatography. The monosaccharide compositions of fractions collected from the Bio-Gel P-4 column were analyzed by GC-MS. The Man, Gal, and GlcNAc contents were plotted against fraction number (Fig. 2). The N-glycans were resolved into two main fractions: a Gal/GlcNAc-(poly-N-LacNAc-) rich high molecular mass fraction eluting at the column void volume (the total poly-LacNAc fraction) and a Man-rich low molecular mass fraction eluting as a broad peak. This column also allowed the removal of the remaining Gal and lactose used in elution from ricin-coupled agarose. A representative chromatogram of the total poly-LacNAc fraction separated by Dionex HPAEC is shown in Fig. 3A. Based on monosaccharide composition analysis, only the peaks eluting after 10 min contained carbohydrate. The poly-LacNAc fraction resolved into more than 20 discrete peaks. However, almost 70% of N-glycans eluted at the end of the gradient as large unresolved peak. This material was pooled as the VLPL fraction. Structural Analysis of the VLPL Fraction—The VLPL fraction eluted from the Dionex HPAEC column was first subjected to monosaccharide compositional analysis by GC-MS. This fraction contains exclusively Man, Gal, and GlcNAc in the ratio 3:59:60. Methylation linkage analysis (Table I) revealed 2-O-substituted-Man and 3,6-disubstituted-Man and no other types of Man residue. Furthermore, one- and two-dimensional 1H NMR spectra of the same fraction after exchange into 2H2O (Fig. 4, A and B, Table II) revealed resonance values for αMan, βMan and βGlcNAc residues (indicated with an asterisk in Table II) similar to those reported for the conserved Man3GlcNAc2 core of many N-linked glycans (30Geyer A.

https://openalex.org/W2125316546,"Inappropriate activation of the Wnt/APC/beta-catenin signaling pathways plays a critical role at early stages in a variety of human cancers. However, their respective implication in tumor cell invasion is still hypothetical. Here, we show that two activators of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin transcription pathway, namely Dvl-2, the Axin 501-560 fragment binding glycogen synthase kinase -3beta (GSK-3beta), and the negative Wnt regulator wt-Axin did not alter cell invasion into type I collagen. In addition, both Dvl-2 and Axin 501-560 exerted a permissive action on the proinvasive activity of HGF and intestinal trefoil factor. Upstream activation of Wnt signaling by the Wnt-2 and Wnt-3a ligands, stable overexpression of Wnt-2, as well as GSK-3beta inhibition by lithium, SB216763, and GSK-3beta dominant negative forms (K85R and R96E) conferred the invasive phenotype through several proinvasive pathways. Induction of the matrix metalloprotease MMP-7 (matrilysin) gene and protein by Wnt-2 was abolished by inactivation of the AP-1 binding site in the promoter. Accordingly, invasion induced by Wnt-2 was prevented by soluble FRP-3 and FRP-1, sequestration of Gbetagamma subunits, depletion of the GSK-3beta protein by RNA interference, the c-Jun dominant negative mutant TAM67 and was not reversed by wt-Axin. Thus, the proinvasive activity of Wnt-2 is mediated by a noncanonical Wnt pathway using GSK-3beta and the AP-1 oncogene. Our data provide a potential clue for our understanding of the action and crosstalk between Wnt activators and other proinvasive pathways, in relation with matrix substrates and proteases in human cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2036439732,"Recent interest in the annexin 1 field has come from the notion that specific G-protein-coupled receptors, members of the formyl-peptide receptor (FPR) family, appear to mediate the anti-inflammatory actions of this endogenous mediator. Administration of the annexin 1 N-terminal derived peptide Ac2-26 to mice after 25 min ischemia significantly attenuated the extent of acute myocardial injury as assessed 60 min postreperfusion. Evident at the dose of 1 mg/kg (approximately 9 nmol per animal), peptide Ac2-26 cardioprotection was intact in FPR null mice. Similarly, peptide Ac2-26 inhibition of specific markers of heart injury (specifically myeloperoxidase activity, CXC chemokine KC contents, and endogenous annexin 1 protein expression) was virtually identical in heart samples collected from wild-type and FPR null mice. Mouse myocardium expressed the mRNA for FPR and the structurally related lipoxin A4 receptor, termed ALX; thus, comparable equimolar doses of two ALX agonists (W peptide and a stable lipoxin A4 analog) exerted cardioprotection in wild-type and FPR null mice to an equal extent. Curiously, marked (>95%) blood neutropenia produced by an anti-mouse neutrophil serum did not modify the extent of acute heart injury, whereas it prevented the protection afforded by peptide Ac2-26. Thus, this study sheds light on the receptor mechanism(s) mediating annexin 1-induced cardioprotection and shows a pivotal role for ALX and circulating neutrophil, whereas it excludes any functional involvement of mouse FPR. These mechanistic data can help in developing novel therapeutics for acute cardioprotection."

Using dichlorofluorescein diacetate, a detector of endogenous oxidative stress, it was shown that juglone and phenazine methylsulfate are potentially toxic to the parasites without affecting the host cells. These results demonstrate that T. gondii is vulnerable to oxidative challenge that results from disruption of its redox balance and so this could be an effective approach to therapeutic intervention. This study has characterized redox active and antioxidant peroxidases belonging to the class of 1-Cys and 2-Cys peroxiredoxins that play crucial roles in maintaining redox balance. The tachyzoite stages of T. gondii express thioredoxin (TgTrx), 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (TgTrx-Px2), and a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (TgTrx-Px1) and immunofluorescent studies revealed that all three proteins are located in the cytosol of the parasite confirming previous studies on TgTrx-Px1 (Kwok, L.Y., Schlüter, D., Clayton, C., and Soldati, D.

Moreover, the catalytic efficiency of TgTrx-Px1 for these substrates at 106-107m-1 s-1 is unusually high, which qualifies the enzyme as an extremely potent antioxidant. Kinetic analyses revealed that TgTrx-Px1 is inhibited by tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and apparent inhibition constants were determined to be between 33 and 35.6 μm depending on the concentration of the non-inhibitory substrate thioredoxin.

Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 2Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). The enzymes are peroxidases that exert their reductive activity via active site cysteine residues. This group of proteins can structurally be distinguished into three classes: the typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, the atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, and the 1-Cys peroxiredoxins (2Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins have only been identified recently and they differ from typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins by forming an intramolecular disulfide bridge during their catalytic cycle rather than an intermolecular disulfide bridge like typical peroxiredoxins (2Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar, 3Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The abundance of typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins can be extraordinarily high, possibly compensating for their rather low catalytic efficiency when compared with other peroxidases such as catalase and glutathione-dependent peroxidases (1Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 2Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). In addition to their protective antioxidant role, it has been suggested that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are involved in redox signaling and other regulatory processes (2Wood Z.A. Schröder E. Robin Harris J. Poole L.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 32-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar, 4Delaunay A. Pflieger D. Barrault M.B. Vinh J. Toledano M.B.

The role of the 1-Cys peroxiredoxins is less clear. Their catalytic mechanism has hardly been studied to date, and the nature of their endogenous reducing partner is controversial (3Choi H.J.

An infection with T. gondii can be lethal in immunocompromised individuals and presents a particular threat to patients with AIDS/HIV. It is estimated that toxoplasmosis is the cause of death in 10-30% of AIDS patients (10Luft B.J. Remington J.S. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 15: 211-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). In addition, an infection with T. gondii in pregnant women leads to the congenital infection of the fetus (11Desmonts G. Couvreur J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1974; 290: 1110-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar) affecting the central nervous system and leading to a variety of severe disorders. Recently the antioxidant systems of T. gondii have started to attract attention as these might be essential for the adaptation and survival of the parasites in macrophages and other immune effector cells, which probably generate reactive oxygen species to combat the parasites (12Denkers E.Y. Kim L. Butcher B.A. Cell. Microbiol. 2003; 5: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Kwok L.Y. Schluter D. Clayton C. Soldati D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus Toxoplasma needs to have effective antioxidant systems to maintain the intracellular redox homeostasis even when the parasite is under oxidant challenge. In previous studies it has been shown that T. gondii possesses a whole array of antioxidant proteins including three superoxide dismutases, catalase, and a variety of putative glutathione- and thioredoxin-dependent peroxidases of the peroxiredoxin family (13Kwok L.Y.

Nature. 2002; 419: 498-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar), and the members of the kinetoplastida lack this protein and other antioxidants appear to compensate for its absence (18Müller S. Liebau E. Walter R.D. Krauth-Siegel R.L. Trends Parasitol. 2003; 19: 320-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Müller S. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1291-1305Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). As the disruption of the catalase gene in T. gondii was found to be non-lethal, the enzyme presumably does not have a vital role in the parasite (13Kwok L.Y. Schluter D. Clayton C. Soldati D. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 47-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is feasible that the parasite peroxiredoxins compensate for the loss of catalase and indeed the non-essentiality of catalase suggests that this group of proteins represents the major antioxidant defense system in Toxoplasma. Indeed, it has been shown that the thioredoxin-dependent reduction of hydroperoxides is of vital importance in the related apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium falciparum as thioredoxin reductase is essential for survival of this parasite (20Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Cowman A.F. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25970-25975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this study we have characterized the peroxiredoxin proteins of T. gondii, and the results suggest that the systems involving these proteins play key roles in protecting the parasite against oxidative damage. Materials—FITC-labeled secondary anti-rat and anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against T. gondii thioredoxin (TgTrx) in a rat, T. gondii 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (TgTrx-Px2) and 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (TgTrx-Px1) in rabbits by Eurogentec (Belgium). Genomic and cDNA libraries of T. gondii were obtained from the National Institutes of Health. [3H]Uracil (48 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. P. falciparum thioredoxin reductase was expressed and purified according to Gilberger et al. (21Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29584-29589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). P. falciparum thioredoxin was expressed and purified according to Krnajski et al. (22Krnajski Z. Gilberger T.W. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 112: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Minimal essential medium (MEM), Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, RPMI 1640, penicillin/streptomycin, and fetal calf serum were from Invitrogen. Glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli was purchased from Sigma. Human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were from LGC Promochem (Teddington, UK). T. gondii Culture and Determination of IC50 of Oxidative Stressors—T. gondii tachyzoites (RH strain) were maintained on monolayers of HFFs in MEM containing 1% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 according to Ref. 23Roos D.S. Donald R.G.K. Morrissette N.S. Moulton L.C. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 45: 27-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar. In order to determine the susceptibility of T. gondii to the oxidative stressors tert-butyl-hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH), 5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (juglone; Fluka) and the superoxide-generating compound phenazine methylsulfate (Fluka) a monolayer of HFFs was grown in 24-well plates, infected with 1 × 105 parasites per well, and incubated with increasing concentrations of the stressors (0.1 nm to 100 μm). After 24 h, the medium was supplemented with [3H]uracil (2.5 μCi/well) and incubated for an additional 4 h. Then the cells were treated with 0.6 m trichloric acid for 1 h and subsequently washed extensively with excess water overnight. Then the cells were solubilized for 1 h with 500 μl of 0.1 m NaOH before 250 μl of each well are transferred into scintillation vials containing 3 ml of Picofluor scintillation fluid (Packard Bioscience) and the incorporation of [3H]uracil into the ribonucleic acids of the parasites determined by scintillation counting (Beckman LS6500). In a control experiment, non-infected HFFs were treated with increasing concentrations of the three stressors under the same conditions as described for the parasitized cells, and their viability was determined using a Live/Dead assay (Molecular Probes) and subsequent analysis by fluorescent microscopy with an Axiovert 200 M microscope (Zeiss). 2′,7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCF) Assay—HFFs grown on chamber slides (Nunc) were infected with 0.5 × 104T. gondii and after 24 h exposed to 10 μm juglone or 10 μm phenazine methylsulfate for 15 min. After washing the slides, the cells were incubated for 3-5 min with 0.5 μm DCF, washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and subsequently fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. After mounting the slides, the parasites were analyzed using an Axiovert 200 m fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) equipped with AxioCam HRC digital camera (Zeiss). Isolation of Nucleic Acids and Proteins—In order to isolate genomic DNA and total RNA from T. gondii tachyzoites, they were grown to high density and isolated from lysed HFFs using 0.2 μm Nucleopore Track-Etch membranes (Whatman). Parasites were pelleted and either resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA) (for DNA isolation) or TRIzol (Invitrogen) for RNA isolation. In order to obtain parasite proteins, the isolated parasites were resuspended in PBS containing EDTA-free protease mixture (Roche Applied Science) and subsequently lysed by several cycles of freeze-thawing followed by sonication. Cloning of TgTrx-Px1 (2-Cys Peroxiredoxin), TgTrx-Px2 (1-Cys Peroxiredoxin), and TgTrx—Searching the T. gondii genome data base (www.ToxoDB.org) with the translated amino acids sequences of P. falciparum Trx, PfTrx-Px1 (2-Cys peroxiredoxin) and Pf1-CysTrx-Px (1-Cys peroxiredoxin) revealed the presence of homologues of the three Plasmodium proteins. Oligonucleotides TgTrx-1sense and TgTrx-1antisense (5′-GCGCCATATGCCGGTCCATCACGTCACC-3′ and 5′-GCGCGGATCCCTACAAATCCCCGAGACTGTTTGTC-3′), TgTrx-Px1-1 sense and antisense (5′-GCGCCATATGCCGGCCCCGATGGTGTCTCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGCCTCGAGAATGAACGAAGGCTCTATGAGG 3′) and TgTrx-Px2-1 sense and antisense (5′GCGCCATATGTTGGTCCTCGGCAGCACG3′ and 5′GCGCCTCGAGCTACGCCGACGGATCCGGAGC3′) were used to amplify the coding regions of the three genes with Pfu polymerase and a T. gondii cDNA library as template. The conditions for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were as follows: 1 cycle at 95 °C for 1 min and 30 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min 50 to 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C followed by an extension cycle at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were cloned into TOPO blunt (Invitrogen), and their sequences were determined by The Sequencing Service (School of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, Scotland, www.dnaseq.co.uk) using Applied Biosystems Big-Dye Ver 3.1 chemistry on an Applied Biosystems model 3730 automated capillary DNA sequencer. In order to recombinantly express the three T. gondii proteins the inserts of the TOPO clones were isolated by restriction digest using NdeI, BamHI, and XhoI as required and subcloned into pJC40 previously digested with the respective restriction enzymes. The sequence of the expression constructs pJC40-TgTrx, pJC40-TgTrx-Px1, and pJC40-TgTrx-Px2 was verified and they were subsequently transformed into E. coli BLR (DE3)-pLys (Novagen). Recombinant Expression of TgTrx-Px1, TgTrx-Px-2, and TgTrx—Bacteria harboring the expression plasmids were used to inoculate overnight cultures in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg ml-1 ampicillin. The cultures were diluted 1:50 and bacteria grown at 37 °C until their OD600 reached 0.5 before recombinant expression was induced using 1 mm isopropyl-β-thio-d-galactoside. The bacteria were cooled to 27 °C after induction and grown for an additional 18 h before they were harvested at 3500 × g (Beckman J6). Bacterial pellets were resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 containing 300 mm NaCl and 10 mm imidazole (lysis buffer) and lysed by adding 50 μg ml-1 lysozyme, freeze-thawing, and by using a French Press (1000 pounds inch-2; American Instrument Company). The bacterial extract was cleared by centrifugation for 1.5 h at 50,000 × g (Beckman, Avanti, JA-25). The resulting supernatants were applied to Ni2+-agarose, and the subsequent purification of the recombinant proteins was performed in a batch procedure according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford method (24Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Enzyme Assays for Thioredoxin—To test whether T. gondii Trx is a competent substrate of P. falciparum thioredoxin reductase (PfTrxR), the TrxR activity was determined spectrophotometrically using three different assay systems (1Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohe L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In the insulin assay, the reduction of thioredoxin was coupled to the reduction of insulin as previously described (25Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 9627-9632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). The second assay system was performed using a fast kinetics instrument (SFA-20, Hi-Tech Scientific) connected to the spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, 2401 PC) in order to determine the initial rates of Trx reduction (27Akerman S.E. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 200 μm NADPH, 100 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg of PfTrxR, and increasing concentrations of TgTrx or PfTrx (1-20 μm). Time points were taken every 10 ms, and the initial rates were used to determine the steady-state kinetic parameters for the reduction of both parasite Trxs (3Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The third assay system was performed in order to test whether TgTrx also reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG) as has been previously reported for the proteins from P. falciparum and Drosophila melanogaster (28Kanzok S.M. Schirmer R.H. Turbachova I. Iozef R. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40180-40186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 29Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H.

The assay conditions were as follows: 5-10 μg of PfTrxR, 1 to 10 μm TgTrx or PfTrx, and 0.025-2 mm GSSG in 100 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μm NADPH. The change in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm, and the results were used to calculate the second order rate constant k2 according to Equation 1. v=k2⋅[Trx(SH) 2]⋅[GSSG] Further whether TgTrx and PfTrx are reduced by dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (LipDH) and dihydrolipoamide was tested. The assay systems contained 200 μm NADH, 5 units of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Sigma), 25 μm lipoamide, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 10 to 50 μm of TgTrx and PfTrx, and 0.2 mg ml-1 insulin, and the change in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm on a Shimadzu 2401 PC spectrophotometer. The second order rates for the reduction of both parasite Trxs by dihydrolipoamide were calculated according to Equation 2. v=k2⋅[TrxS2]⋅[lipoamide disulfide] Peroxiredoxin Assays—The T. gondii 2-Cys peroxiredoxin kinetic parameters were determined according to Akerman and Müller (27Akerman S.E. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) using a spectrophotometric assay employing stopped-flow fast kinetics with 15 μg of PfTrxR, 1-25 μm TgTrx, 0.2 μm TgTrx-Px1, 100 mm Hepes pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 200 μm NADPH, and 0.5-15 μm hydroperoxide substrate. Steady-state kinetic parameters for the interaction TgTrx-Px1 with hydrogen peroxide and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (0.5-50 μm) were determined, and the resulting data were fitted using Grafit 5.0. Substrates for TgTrx-Px2—To establish the catalytic activity of TgTrx-Px2 the glutamine synthetase (GS) protection assay was utilized as described by Kim et al. (30Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the endogenous reducing partner of T. gondii 1-Cys peroxiredoxins is elusive, a number of intracellular thiols, glutathione and dihydrolipoamide and dithiol-containing peptides, thioredoxin and glutaredoxin from P. falciparum, were tested for their ability to act as a reductant for TgTrx-Px2. The assay system consisted of 1 mm GSH, 200 μm NADPH, 100 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 8-10 μg of P. falciparum glutathione reductase prepared according to Ref. 31Gilberger T.W. Schirmer R.H. Walter R.D. Müller S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 107: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 0.5-5 μm TgTrx-Px2 and 100 μm H2O2. The glutaredoxin assay system essentially contained the same components as described above with the exception that 1-10 μmP. falciparum glutaredoxin, prepared according to Ref. 32Rahlfs S. Fischer M. Becker K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37133-37140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, was included into the assay before the reaction was initiated by addition of H2O2. In the third assay system it was assessed whether lipoic acid acts as a reductant for both parasite 1-Cys peroxiredoxins using the following assay conditions, 200 μm NADH, 5-50 μm lipoamide, 5 units of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Sigma), 0.5-20 μm peroxiredoxin, and 100 μm H2O2. To test the ability of thioredoxin to act as a reducing thiol, a similar assay system as shown above with TgTrx-Px1 was performed where TgTrx-Px 1 was replaced with TgTrx-Px2. Western Blotting—Polyclonal antibodies were raised against TgTrx in rats and against TgTrx-Px1 and TgTrx-Px2 in rabbits (Eurogentec). The antibodies were purified according to standard protocols (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and used to detect the three proteins in Western blots of T. gondii tachyzoite protein extracts. The parasite protein extract was separated on a 4-12% SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and subsequently blotted onto nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with the primary anti-TgTrx rat antibody at 1:1000 dilution, the anti-TgTrx-Px1 at 1:250 dilution, and with the anti-TgTrx-Px2 antibody at 1:2000 dilution according to Sambrook et al. (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Anti-rat or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (DaKo; Scottish Antibody Production Unit) were applied at 1:5000, and the blots were developed using the ECL+ system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—HFFs grown on chamber slides were infected with 0.5 × 104T. gondii, and after 24 h the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldeyde for 5 min at 37 °C and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. The wells were washed twice with PBS between each stage and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidity chamber. Subsequently the wells were washed three times with PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 prior to incubation with primary rat anti-TgTrx or purified rabbit anti-TgTrx-Px1 and purified rabbit anti-TgTrx-Px2 antibodies, respectively, at dilutions between 1:200 and 1:2000 for at least 1 h at room temperature. After several washes with PBS, 0.05% Tween-20 the cells were incubated with a FITC-labeled anti-rat or anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) at a dilution of 1:500, incubated for 1 h, and after several washes slides were mounted using the slowfade light antifade kit containing 1.5 μg ml-1 DAPI (Molecular Probes) to stain the nucleic acids. Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress—T. gondii tachyzoites were exposed to increasing concentrations of the exogenous oxidant tert-butyl hydroperoxide and inducers of oxidative stress (juglone, phenazine methylsulfate) to determine their IC50 values (concentrations that caused 50% inhibition of viability). The latter two compounds cause endogenous oxidative stress either by generating reactive oxygen species by redox cycling or by non-enzymatic generation of superoxide anions in the presence of NADH or NADPH (34Hebbel R.P. Leung A. Mohandas N. Blood. 1990; 76: 1015-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kampkötter A. Volkmann T.E. de Castro S.H. Leiers B. Klotz L.O. Johnson T.E. Link C.D. Henkle-Dührsen K. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). T. gondii were found to be highly sensitive to all three compounds with IC50 values in the range between 100 and 500 nm (Fig. 1). They are most susceptible to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (IC50: 100 ± 8 nm) followed by juglone (IC50: 148 ± 16 nm) and phenazine methylsulfate (IC50: 406 ± 134 nm). At these concentrations, the viability of the host cells (HFFs) was not affected, as shown by incubating them by themselves under the same conditions as the parasite-infected HFFs and monitoring their viability with a Live/Dead assay system (data not shown). Indeed, the HFFs only start to show some response to the three stressors at concentrations 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those affecting parasite growth. Further investigation revealed that parasite death was very likely caused by increased oxidative stress. Incubation of T. gondii-infected HFFs with the stressors and subsequent monitoring of the occurrence of oxidative stress using DCF, which enters the cell and is converted into a fluorescent compound after reaction with H2O2 (36Jakubowski W. Bartosz G. Cell Biol. Int. 2000; 24: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), revealed that juglone and phenazine methylsulfate cause strong fluorescence in the parasites, whereas no fluorescence was detected in the control cells (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the host cells did not show any increased oxidative stress, suggesting that the stressors specifically affected the parasite. Sequence Analyses of TgTrx-Px1, TgTrx-Px-2, and TgTrx—The genes encoding TgTrx-Px1 (2-Cys peroxiredoxin), TgTrx-Px2 (1-Cys peroxiredoxin), and TgTrx were amplified by PCR using a cDNA library as a template. The TgTrx-Px1 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 196 amino acids and a theoretical molecular size of 21.7 kDa with 52.0% identity to P. falciparum 2-Cys peroxiredoxin PfTrx-Px1 and 55.6% identity to Trx-Px from Magnetoccocus (ZP_00043412), 53.6% identity to Trx-Px II from H. sapiens (P32119). TgTrx-Px1 contains two VCP motifs at positions 50-52 and 170-172, which is typical for the class of 2-Cys peroxiredoxins ("
https://openalex.org/W2037299230,"We previously isolated a new member of the fused-type S100 protein family (hornerin) from the mouse (Makino, T., Takaishi, M., Morohashi, M., and Huh, N.-h. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47445–47452). Mouse hornerin shares structural features, expression profiles, and intracellular localization with profilaggrin, indicating possible involvement of hornerin in cornification. In this study, we identified and partially characterized a human ortholog of mouse hornerin. The human hornerin gene was mapped between trichohyalin and filaggrin on chromosome 1q21.3, the region being completely syntenic with the counterpart of the mouse. The deduced amino acid sequence of 2850 residues shows typical structural features of “fused-type” S100 protein family members. Mature transcripts and protein from human hornerin were not detected in normal stratified epithelium, including the trunk epidermis, tongue, and esophagus. After screening of various normal and pathological human tissues, we found that human hornerin was expressed in psoriatic skin. Hornerin protein was present in the keratinizing region, although at a lower level and in fewer cells compared with filaggrin. Mature transcripts and protein from hornerin were also detected in regenerating human skin after wounding. Hornerin mRNA was induced 5 days after wounding. The mRNA level remained almost constant until 15 days and declined at 30 days after wounding. Hornerin protein was detected in the proximal epidermis (but not in the distal epidermis) at 15 days after wounding. These results indicate that hornerin has a function similar to but distinct from that of filaggrin in cornification. We previously isolated a new member of the fused-type S100 protein family (hornerin) from the mouse (Makino, T., Takaishi, M., Morohashi, M., and Huh, N.-h. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 47445–47452).

Among the proteins found in the cornified envelope, filaggrin plays a unique pivotal role in cornification. Filaggrin produced by post-translational proteolysis of the precursor protein, profilaggrin, promotes the aggregation of keratin filaments, resulting in the formation of disulfide bonds among them (30Dale B.A. Biochim.

At a later stage, filaggrin is further processed by modification of some amino acid residues and degradation to free amino acids, this being instrumental in keeping epidermal hydration and flexibility (34Rawlings A.V. Scott I.R. Harding C.R. Bowser P.A. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1994; 103: 731-741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and in absorbing UV (35Scott I.R. Biochem. J. 1981; 194: 829-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We previously identified a protein (hornerin) in the mouse by RNA differential display (36Makino T. Takaishi M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It shares structural features with fused-type S100 proteins, particularly with profilaggrin, i.e. having Ca2+-binding EF-hand domains at the N terminus, followed by a spacer sequence and a large repetitive domain. Hornerin was found to be expressed in cornifying stratified epithelium, including the epidermis, tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. In the epidermis, hornerin was found to be colocalized with profilaggrin in keratohyalin granules in cells in the granular layer (37Makino T. Takaishi M. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that hornerin has a function that is similar to or that mutually complements profilaggrin in the cornifying epithelium. In this study, we identified and characterized a human homolog of mouse hornerin. Unexpectedly, human hornerin was not detected in normal trunk skin, but it was expressed in regenerating and psoriatic skin. Thus, human hornerin may have a function similar to but distinct from that of profilaggrin. Identification of Human Hornerin cDNA—A cDNA library of normal human skin was prepared using λZAPII (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and screened using a 674-bp segment covering the 3′-end of the coding region as a probe under conventional conditions. 5′-RACE 1The abbreviations used are: RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; RT, reverse transcription; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; contigs, groups of overlapping clones. was performed using a 5′-Full RACE Core Set (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Template RNA was derived from psoriatic skin tissue, and the primers used were as follows: RT-PCR, P-TGAGTGTCATCTCTC; first PCR sense, 5′-GATATTCAAGCTGGTTCAGG-3′; first PCR antisense, 5′-GTTATGGTCTCGATCCAGAC-3′; second PCR sense, 5′-GCCAAGTTTCAGGGTCAAAG-3′; and second PCR antisense, 5′-TATCCACAGTATCTGGATCG-3′. Altogether, five clones were isolated and sequenced. Detection of mRNA—Human multiple tissue expression MTA™ Array 2 (Clontech) was hybridized with a 32P-labeled probe of the 3′-untranslated region of human hornerin cDNA under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. For RT-PCR, total RNA was prepared from psoriatic skin tissues by a method described previously (37Makino T. Takaishi M. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). RNAs from adult and fetal skin, vulva, and tongue were purchased from Stratagene. Total RNA was extracted from regenerating skin using TriReagent (Sigma). All of the RNA samples were pretreated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) and confirmed to give no positive signals without reverse transcription. Reverse transcription was performed with random hexamers and Superscript III (Invitrogen). The primers used for PCR were as follows: hornerin 5′, 5′-ATGCCTAAACTCCTACAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTATGGTCTCGATCCAGAC-3′ (antisense); hornerin 3′, 5′-GGTTCGTCTTCCCACTATGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGTAGCACCTCTGCTCTTGG-3′ (antisense); hornerin intron, 5′-GTAAGAACTCCACGCCAGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGACTGTCTGGGTTTGTAGG-3′ (antisense); filaggrin, 5′-GGGAAGTTATCTTTTCCTGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GATGTGCTAGCCCTGATGTTG-3′ (antisense); keratin-5, 5′-TGCTGCAAGTCACTGCCTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGAACACATTCTGGAGGTAG-3′ (antisense); keratin-16, 5′-GCTGAACAAAGAAGTGGCCTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGAAGCTGGATGAGCTCTGCT-3′ (antisense); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAACG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGTTG-3′ (antisense). The amplified DNA fragments were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Preparation of Antiserum—To prepare antiserum, an oligopeptide (CSRGPYESGSSHS) corresponding to part of the repetitive units of human hornerin was synthesized, conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and injected with adjuvant (TyterMax Gold, CytRx Corp.) into rabbits. The resulting antibody was affinity-purified using a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated column (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated to the peptides. Western Blot Analysis—Normal human skin and psoriatic skin were obtained from the trunk and thigh, respectively, after acquiring written informed consents. After thoroughly removing dermal tissues, protein extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting as described previously (37Makino T. Takaishi M. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were extracted in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 5 mm EDTA containing a protease inhibitor mixture after homogenization. The proteins were precipitated with cold 10% trichloroacetic acid and redissolved in 9 m urea, 2% Triton X-100, and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol. Lithium dodecyl sulfate was added to 2%, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to 7.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). 10- or 20-μg eq of protein were applied to 5–20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (PAGEL, Atto, Tokyo, Japan), electrophoresed, and transferred to PolyScreen transfer membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were treated with an anti-hornerin antibody or an antihuman filaggrin monoclonal antibody (Biomedical Technologies, Inc., Stoughton, MA), and positive signals were visualized by ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). The following antibodies were also used as primary antibodies: anti-human cytokeratin-6 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA), anti-human cytokeratin-14 monoclonal antibody (Biomeda, Foster City, CA), and anti-bovine desmoplakin-1/2 monoclonal antibody (Progen Biotechnik, Heidelberg, Germany). Preimmune antisera and the antibodies absorbed by the peptide were used for negative controls. Immunohistochemistry—Psoriatic human skin tissues were fixed with 10% formalin solution. 5-μm thick sections were treated with heat at 105 °C for 5 min in 1 mm EDTA and cooled down spontaneously. The sections were blocked with serum-free protein block (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA) for 30 min and incubated with primary antibodies (anti-human hornerin or anti-human filaggrin described above) and then with TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Regenerating skin tissues were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and processed and immunostained under the same conditions as those described for the psoriatic skin tissues. The antibody used for cytokeratin-6 was the same as that used in the Western blot analysis. Preimmune serum or anti-human hornerin antibody pre-absorbed by the immunogen peptide gave consistently negative results. The tissue sections were observed under an Olympus fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser microscope. Identification of Human Hornerin cDNA—By a homology search using a sequence covering the EF-hand domain of mouse hornerin, we identified a human homolog of mouse hornerin at a chromosomal locus between those of filaggrin and trichohyalin on chromosome 1q21.3 (Fig. 1A). The region including hornerin and neighboring genes on human chromosome 1q21.3 was completely syntenic with a region on mouse chromosome 3F2.1 (Fig. 1B). Based on this sequence information, we obtained a 3′-terminal cDNA clone by library screening and 5′-terminal fragments by 5′-RACE. The base sequence of the isolated cDNA fragments matched well with that registered in the human genome data base. Altogether, we identified a 9621-bp cDNA, followed by a poly(A) tail. An open reading frame encoding a protein of 2850 amino acids was found. The human hornerin gene is composed of three exons 51, 161, and 9409 bp in length (Fig. 1C). The coding region occupies the 3′-half of the second exon and most of the third exon. The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-end (240 bp) is shown in Fig. 1D with precise insertion sites of the introns. A putative TATA box (TATAAA) was found in the genomic DNA sequence from -26 to -31 upstream of the 5′-end of the present cDNA. The sequences of the 5′- and 3′-terminal regions of human hornerin were registered in the GenBank™/EBI Data Bank under accession numbers AB180729 and AB104446, respectively. The putative full-length cDNA sequence was assigned as BR000036.Fig. 1Identification of the human hornerin gene.

Genomics. 1997; 43: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass is 28.2 kDa, and the pI is 10.04. It contains abundant serine (33.7%), glycine (24.4%), glutamine/glutamate (12.1%), and histidine (9.5%) residues, a common characteristic of mouse hornerin and mouse and human filaggrins. Clustering of EF-hand domains of the representative fused-type S100 proteins revealed that the EF-hand domain of human hornerin is most similar to that of mouse hornerin among the members (Fig. 2B). This finding and the syntenic chromosomal loci of the human and mouse hornerin genes (Fig. 1A) indicate that the gene we identified is a genuine ortholog of mouse hornerin. Sequence similarity between human and mouse hornerin is high in the EF-hand domains (∼75%) (Fig. 2C) and the spacer region (∼60%), but limited in the repetitive region (<50%). The repetitive region was classified at first into six segments, 1–6 (Fig. 2A), which were each further divided into three segments (*A, *B, and *C; asterisks indicate wild-card figures of segments 1–6) 153∼158 amino acids in length. Segment 6B is truncated, having only 128 amino acids. Each of segments *A, *B, and *C is further composed of four repeats 39 ± 2 amino acids in length (*AI–IV, *BI–IV, and *CI–IV). As shown in Fig. 3A, the difference in amino acid sequence within segments A, B, or C is smaller than that among the segments with different first numeral designations but the same alphabetical designations. Within each of segments *A, *B, and *C, the smallest units of ∼39 amino acids showed moderate homology (54∼69%) to each other. When the smallest units were analyzed by an algorithm of ClustalW (available at clustalw.genome.jp/), segment *AI, for example, showed higher homology to other *AI segments than to segments *AII–IV, *BI–IV, or *CI–IV (data not shown). This was also the case for other units. Alignment of amino acid sequences of representative segments, i.e. 1A–6A and 4A–4C, is shown in Fig. 3 (B and C, respectively). These results are compatible with the notion that a progenitor unit of ∼39 amino acids was at first amplified 4-fold and then triplicated during evolution to form segments A, B, and C in tandem, these being further amplified 6-fold. Expression of Human Hornerin in Psoriatic Skin—We first examined the expression of hornerin in various human tissues using a poly(A)+ RNA array. The array covers most of the human tissues (except for skin), including those of the central nervous system, digestive system (including the esophagus), respirocirculatory system, and urogenital tract, but none of them were positive for expression of hornerin. We then examined various human skin tissues for hornerin expression by RT-PCR. Mature processed mRNA from hornerin was detected in psoriatic skin and vulva as evidenced by a 198-bp band amplified with the 5′-terminal primers, but not in normal human fetal and adult skin and tongue (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly, unprocessed transcripts of hornerin containing the second intron, giving rise to a DNA fragment 1823 bp in length, were present even in normal skin and tongue. In accordance with the results of RT-PCR, hornerin protein was detected by Western blot analysis in psoriatic skin, but not in normal skin, whereas filaggrin was expressed in both tissues (Fig. 4B). The ladder-like bands of hornerin are probably partially degraded proteins as a result of post-translational processing (36Makino T. Takaishi M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). No corresponding bands were detected with preimmune serum or with antibody pre-absorbed by the peptide used for immunization (Fig. 4B). The discrete bands of desmoplakin indicated that even proteins of high molecular mass were not nonspecifically degraded in the cell extracts used for analysis. The expression levels of cytokeratin-14 in normal and psoriatic skin tissues were similar, whereas hyperproliferation-related cytokeratin-6 was abundant in psoriatic skin, but not in normal skin. Immunohistochemistry of normal human skin tissues revealed that profilaggrin (but not hornerin) was expressed in the upper layer of the epidermis (data not shown). Fig. 5A shows the results of immunostaining of lesional skin from a psoriatic patient. It is known that the active proximal region of a psoriatic lesion often lacks the granular layer (and thus profilaggrin expression), whereas the periphery is in a healing process and has a thicker granular layer (hematoxylin/eosin-stained panels in Fig. 5A) (40Iizuka H. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Honda H. Br. J. Dermatol. 1996; 135: 433-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Profilaggrin was detected occasionally in the proximal region and consistently in the peripheral region of the psoriatic lesion. Hornerin was detected in the area positive for profilaggrin. However, hornerin protein was present in the keratinizing region, although at a lower level and in fewer cells compared with filaggrin. In an image at a higher magnification, it is clear that only some of the filaggrin-positive cells synthesized hornerin protein (Fig. 5B). Both hornerin and filaggrin proteins were present in a granular pattern in the cytoplasm. Hornerin was expressed in the lesional epidermis but not in the non-lesional epidermis of psoriatic patients (Fig. 5A). Expression of Human Hornerin in Regenerating Epidermis— Hornerin protein was detected not in the entire area of the psoriatic lesion, but mainly in the periphery of the lesion, where the skin was in a process of healing. This prompted us to examine the expression of hornerin in regenerating skin after wounding. Full-thickness skin lesions 3 mm in diameter were made with a skin punch biopsy instrument in the medial side of the upper arm of a healthy volunteer. 2, 5, 15, and 30 days after wounding, 5-mm punch biopsies were taken and analyzed. Processed transcripts of hornerin lacking the second intron were induced at 5 days, and the level remained almost constant until 15 days and declined at 30 days after wounding (Fig. 6A). Unprocessed hornerin transcripts were persistently present. Cytokeratin-16 was induced 2 days after wounding. Skin biopsies obtained 15 days after wounding were used for immunohistochemistry. Hornerin protein was detected in the proximal epidermis (∼2 mm from the center of the wound), but not in the distal epidermis (∼5 mm from the center of the wound) (Fig. 6B). Cytokeratin-6, which is known to be expressed in hyperproliferative epidermal keratinocytes (41Korge B. Stadler R. Mischke D. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 450-455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 42Leigh I.M. Navsaria H. Purkis P.E. McKay I.A. Bowden P.E. Riddle P.N. Br. J. Dermatol. 1995; 133: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), was induced in the proximal region from the wound (Fig. 6C). Cytokeratin-6-positive cells were restricted to the proximal epidermis from the center of the wound, whereas hornerin was detected in a larger area, but only in limited layers. Gene Structure—The synteny of the chromosomal region surrounding the hornerin gene is perfectly conserved between humans and mice (Fig. 1A). The hornerin gene is composed of three exons and two introns. The initiation codon is located in the second exon, and the long repetitive region is devoid of introns. This exon/intron composition is shared by the mouse hornerin gene (36Makino T. Takaishi M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), the human and mouse profilaggrin genes, and some other fused-type S100 protein genes (32Rothnagel J.A.

Genomics. 1997; 43: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of the EF-hand domains of fused-type S100 proteins are well conserved in comparison with the remaining parts of the genes. The EF-hand domain of human hornerin shows 76% identity and 97% similarity to that of mouse hornerin and 50∼60% identity and 85∼90% similarity to those of human profilaggrin, repetin, and trichohyalin (Fig. 2, B and C) (data not shown). In contrast, the amino acid sequences of the repetitive regions of human and mouse hornerin are only ∼40% identical. Repetitive Segments—The repetitive region of human hornerin is composed of six triplet segments (A, B, and C) 153∼158 amino acids in length (Fig. 2A). The amino acid sequences of the repetitive segments are well conserved. For example, the amino acid sequence of segment 3A shows ∼97% identity to those of segments 4A and 5A (Fig. 3B). Each segment is further composed of four units 39 ± 2 amino acids in length. Homology analysis indicated that a progenitor unit of ∼39 amino acids was at first amplified 4-fold and then triplicated during evolution to form segments A, B, and C in tandem, these being further amplified 6-fold in tandem (see “Results”). In the case of mouse hornerin, repetitive units are ∼170 amino acids in length, and no smaller unit structure is noted (36Makino T. Takaishi M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the structural features of the repetitive regions of human and mouse hornerin differ greatly at least at the present stage of evolution. Similarly, human profilaggrin has 10∼12 repeats 324 amino acids in length, whereas mouse pro-filaggrin has >20 repeats of 250 or 255 amino acids (32Rothnagel J.A. Mehrel T. Idler W.W. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15643-15648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Presland R.B. Haydock P.V. Fleckman P. Nirunsuksiri W. Dale B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23772-23781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the structures of the repetitive regions, the general structures of the gene, the amino acid sequences of the EF-hand domains, and the amino acid composition of the repetitive region are well conserved not only in human and mouse hornerin, but also among other fused-type S100 proteins, including profilaggrin. Intriguing questions of how the repetitive structures were diversified and why such diverse structures are tolerated remain unanswered. Expression of Hornerin—In the mouse, the expression profile of hornerin is similar to that of profilaggrin, and both proteins are co-localized in keratohyalin granules (37Makino T. Takaishi M. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Hornerin and filaggrin proteins were detected in the epidermis, tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. Unexpectedly, human hornerin was not expressed in the normal trunk epidermis, tongue, and esophagus. By screening various normal and pathological human tissues, we found that hornerin was expressed in psoriatic and regenerating epidermis (Figs. 4 and 5). Trichohyalin is a fused-type S100 protein that was originally found to be expressed in the inner root sheath in hair follicles (43Rothnagel J.A. Rogers G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 44Fietz M.J. Presland R.B. Rogers G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was later shown to be expressed in a variety of pathological human epidermal tissues as well as in the tongue, hard palate, and nail bed (45Hamilton E.H. Payne Jr., R.E. O'Keefe E.J. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 666-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 46O'Guin W.M. Manabe M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 642 (Discussion 62–53): 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In these tissues, the expression of trichohyalin was found to be closely associated with the expression of cytokeratin-6 and cytokeratin-16. Human hornerin was also detected in some cytokeratin-6-positive epidermal keratinocytes in regenerating skin after wounding, but hornerin-positive cells only partially overlapped with cytokeratin-6-positive cells in regenerating skin (Fig. 6C). RNA Processing—Neither mature mRNA nor protein from hornerin was detected in normal human epidermis. However, RT-PCR showed the presence of unprocessed transcripts of hornerin with intron 2 in normal human skin (Fig. 4A). Mature mRNA was induced in regenerating epidermis 5 days after wounding, and the level remained constant until 15 days and declined at 30 days after wounding (Fig. 6A). The consistent presence of unprocessed hornerin transcripts indicates that the expression level of human hornerin in the epidermis is at least partly regulated post-transcriptionally through modulation of the efficiency of RNA processing. Jarrous and Kaempfer (47Jarrous N. Kaempfer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23141-23149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that super-induction of retinoic acid-induced interleukin-1β mRNA by cycloheximide is dependent on enhanced processing of the precursor transcripts. Regulation of gene expression at the stage of RNA processing probably facilitates a rapid response to an induction signal. It is not clear, however, why human hornerin needs to be regulated in such a way and whether other fused-type S100 protein genes encoded in the epidermal differentiation complex are regulated similarly. Our present observation could be a step toward exploring such questions. Functions of Human Hornerin in Normal and Pathological Skin—Evidence obtained in our previous studies on mouse hornerin indicates that hornerin is coexpressed with profilaggrin and plays roles similar to those of profilaggrin in the cornifying epithelium (36Makino T. Takaishi M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47445-47452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 37Makino T. Takaishi M. Toyoda M. Morohashi M. Huh N-h. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 485-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In humans, however, hornerin is not expressed in normal adult and fetal truck skin, as revealed in this study. Expression of hornerin appears not to be related to hair since human hair follicles and scalp epidermis are devoid of hornerin expression (data not shown). Instead, human hornerin protein was detected in regenerating skin after wounding and in psoriatic skin. Expression of hornerin may be dependent on the hyperproliferative state of the epidermis, although hornerin-positive cells overlapped only partially with cells expressing cytokeratin-6, a keratin known to be expressed in hyperproliferative keratinocytes (41Korge B.

Dermatol. 1995; 133: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Absent granular layer-type ichthyosis vulgaris is known to lack the granular layer of the epidermis, and keratinocytes from patients with this disorder express reduced amounts of profilaggrin mRNA and protein (24Sybert V.P.

Epidermal keratinocytes of lamellar ichthyosis show variable expression of filaggrin (28Pena Penabad C. Perez Arellano J.L. Gutierrez de Becker E. Diego J. Garcia Salgado M.J. Valle F.J.

Studies on possible alteration of hornerin expression in absent granular layer-type ichthyosis vulgaris, lamellar ichthyosis, and some other human diseases with deteriorated keratinization may lead to a better understanding of the functions of hornerin in keratinocytes under physiological and pathological conditions.

FOG proteins physically interact with members of the GATA family of transcriptional activators and modulate their activity. We have previously shown that FOG-2 can bind to the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 and, via this interaction, repress GATA4-mediated transcriptional activation of various cardiac promoters. In this report we further characterize the domain of FOG-2 necessary for repression of GATA4 transcriptional activity. We show that FOG-2-mediated repression is not blocked by the histone deacetylase inhibitor tricostatin A, suggesting that FOG-2 repression of GATA4 occurs via a histone deacetylase independent mechanism. N-terminal deletion mutants of FOG-2 revealed that the first 12 amino acids of FOG-2 are necessary for FOG-2-mediated repression. Fusion of these 12 amino acids to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 demonstrated that this region is sufficient to mediate transcriptional repression even when recruited to a heterologous promoter. Single amino acid substitutions within this N-terminal domain of FOG-2 defined the critical amino acid sequence as RRKQxxPxxI. Interestingly, a search of the NCBI protein data base identified several other partially characterized zinc finger transcriptional repressors from various vertebrate species that contained this motif at their N terminus.

Taken together, these observations define a novel transcriptional repression motif and a superfamily of zinc finger transcriptional repressors. It is becoming apparent that transcriptional repression plays an important role in the development of organ systems in many different model organisms. In Drosophila, the repressors knirps and even-skipped have been shown to be critical for the initial formation of body segments within the developing embryo (1Clyde D.E. Corado M.S. Wu X. Pare A. Papatsenko D. Small S. Nature. 2003; 426: 849-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 2Frasch M. Warrior R. Tugwood J. Levine M. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1824-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In mammals, the transcriptional repressor N-CoR is critical for normal thymocyte, erythrocyte, and central nervous system development (3Jepsen K. Hermanson O. Onami T.M. Gleiberman A.S. Lunyak V. McEvilly R.J. Kurokawa R. Kumar V. Liu F. Seto E. Hedrick S.M. Mandel G. Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2000; 102: 753-763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), whereas chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II (coup-TFII) is required for the development of the heart and vascular system (4Pereira F.A. Qiu Y. Zhou G. Tsai M.J. Tsai S.Y. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1037-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repressors can be broadly categorized into three classes; those that inhibit the basal transcriptional machinery, those that block the function of activators, and those that modulate chromatin structure (5Gaston K. Jayaraman P.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 721-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of the basal transcriptional machinery include even-skipped, which is thought to block transcription by binding directly to TATA-binding protein (TBP) 1The abbreviations used are: TBP, TATA-binding protein; HDAC, histone deacetylase; CtBP, C-terminal-binding protein; FOG, Friend of GATA; ANF, atrial naturetic factor; hGH, human growth hormone; TSA, tricostatin A. and preventing TBP interaction with the TATA box (6Li C. Manley J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3771-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An example of a repressor that functions through blocking a transcriptional activator is the repressor Id, which inhibits transcription by binding to other basic helix-loop-helix-containing transcriptional activators and blocking their ability to bind DNA (7Benezra R. Davis R.L. Lockshon D. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Cell. 1990; 61: 49-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of activator activity may also function by increasing activator degradation or altering the subcellular localization of the activator (5Gaston K. Jayaraman P.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 721-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Finally, repressors that alter chromatin structure are often dependent on histone deacetylases (HDACs) and include repressors such as retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (Rb) and C-terminal-binding protein (CtBP) (8Brehm A. Miska E.A. McCance D.J. Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 1998; 391: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (1080) Google Scholar, 9Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C.

Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Repressors such as these are thought to function by recruiting various HDACs to the local chromatin, resulting in the deacetylation of the N-terminal tail of the histones within that chromatin region, leading to a more condensed chromatin structure and inhibiting access of other transcriptional activators to the target gene. Other mechanisms of chromatin remodeling include the inhibition of histone acetyltransferases or the recruitment and activation of histone methyltransferases (5Gaston K. Jayaraman P.S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 721-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). It is likely that we are just beginning to realize the complexity of repressive mechanisms involved in the regulation of development. The FOG family of proteins are transcriptional co-factors that have been shown to be critical for development of the hematopoietic as well as cardiovascular system in flies, frogs, and mice (11Tevosian S.G.

Indeed, mice deficient in FOG-1 fail to form mature erythrocytes or megakaryocytes and die at embryonic day (E) 11.5 due to severe anemia (13Tsang A.P. Fujiwara Y. Hom D.B. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1176-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). FOG-1 also plays a role in heart development as mice with a FOG-1 gene disruption in the developing cardiac and vascular endothelium die at E14.5 secondary to a double outlet right ventricle and a common atrioventricular valve (16Katz S.G. Williams A. Yang J. Fujiwara Y. Tsang A.P. Epstein J.A. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar).

Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of FOG proteins for the development of the hematopoietic and cardiovascular system. All FOG proteins contain multiple zinc finger domains and physically interact with members of the GATA family of transcriptional activators (17Tevosian S.G. Deconinck A.E. Cantor A.B. Rieff H.I.

FOG proteins specifically bind to the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA factors, and this interaction can be disrupted by point mutations within this zinc finger (18Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 22Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. MacKay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Mice homozygous for such mutations in GATA4 die in utero of congenital heart defects that are similar to those seen in FOG-2-deficient mice (23Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. Thurberg B.L. Litovsky S.H. Collins T. Molkentin J.D. Orkin S.H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 839-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mice with mutations in the N-terminal zinc fingers of GATA1 and GATA2 recapitulate the phenotype seen in FOG-1-deficient mice (24Chang A.N. Cantor A.B. Fujiwara Y. Lodish M.B. Droho S. Crispino J.D. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). These results support the notion that interaction with GATA factors is required for function of FOG proteins in development. The FOG-GATA interaction can result in either repression or synergistic activation of target promoters (18Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Recent work suggests that the presence of a binding site for the Ets-family transcription factor Fli-1 in close proximity to a GATA site can convert FOG-1 from a co-repressor to a co-activator (26Wang X. Crispino J.D. Letting D.L. Nakazawa M. Poncz M. Blobel G.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5225-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, in most cell and promoter contexts examined to date, FOG proteins behave as transcriptional co-repressors, decreasing the ability of GATA factors to activate transcription. One potential mechanism for this repression would be the recruitment of other transcriptional repressors to the promoter complex. One such repressor is the chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II, which has been shown to interact with a domain of FOG-2 that includes zinc fingers 5 and 6 (32Huggins G.S. Bacani C.J. Boltax J. Aikawa R. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28029-28036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, a truncated form of FOG-2 lacking this domain is still able to efficiently mediate repression in vitro (28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). FOG proteins have also been shown to interact with the CtBP co-repressor family. Both FOG-1 and FOG-2 have consensus binding sites for CtBP proteins and have been shown to interact with them in vitro (15Deconinck A.E. Mead P.E. Tevosian S.G. Crispino J.D. Katz S.G. Zon L.I. Orkin S.H. Development. 2000; 127: 2031-2040PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fox A.H. Liew C. Holmes M. Kowalski K. Mackay J. Crossley M.

Biol. 2002; 22: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, disruption of this interaction by mutagenesis does not abolish the ability of FOG-2 to repress transcription in vitro (20Fox A.H. Liew C. Holmes M. Kowalski K. Mackay J. Crossley M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2812-2822Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In addition, targeted disruption of the CtBP-interacting domain of FOG-1 in mice results in no obvious hematopoietic phenotype, suggesting that the FOG-CtBP interaction is not required for erythroid or megakaryocyte development (33Katz S.G. Cantor A.B. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 3121-3128Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the mechanism by which FOG proteins mediate transcriptional repression is complex and incompletely understood. In our previous work we demonstrated that a transcriptional repression domain was also present in the N terminus of FOG-1 and FOG-2 (28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In this report we further characterize this repression domain and refine it to the first 12 amino acids within FOG proteins. We show this domain to be both necessary and sufficient to mediate transcriptional repression when linked to a heterologous DNA binding domain. We demonstrate that this repression is mediated in an HDAC-independent fashion and define the critical amino acid residues within this domain that are required for repression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these amino acids are conserved across vertebrate species in the FOG proteins and have identified this repression motif in other partially characterized zinc finger containing transcriptional repressors. Taken together, these observations define a novel transcriptional repression family and a repression motif that may be critical in a number of developmental processes. Plasmid Construction—The constructs p-638 ANF GH, pSV40Gal4-Luc, pVRβGal, pcDNA GATA4, and pcDNA FOG-2 have been described previously (28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Expression constructs for mutant FOG-2 proteins were generated using PCR and the following primers: 5′-TTCAGGTGCATTTCTAGAGCTCGG with WT (5′-CCAAGCTTGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAG), DEL 2–18 (5′-CCAAGCTTGGATCCGAAATGGCCATCGACGACGAGGAAGA), 2–6A (5′-CCAAGCTTGGATCCGAAATGGCCGCGGCAGCGGCGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCAA), 7–12A (5′-CAAGCTTGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGGCTGCAGCCGCGGCGGCCAAACGGCCGCTGGAAGATGC), 13–18A (5′-CCAAGCTTGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCGCAGCGGCGGCGGCAGCTGCCATCGACGACGAGGAAGA), S2A(5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGGCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCC), R3A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCGCGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAG), R4A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGGCAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATC), K5A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAGCGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCAAACGG), Q6A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGGCGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCAAACGG), S7A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGGCTAAACCCCGGCAGATCAAACGGCC), K8A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTGCACCCCGGCAGATCAAACGGCCGCTG), P9A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAAGCCCGGCAGATCAAACGGCCGCTGG), R10A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCGCGCAGATCAAACGGCCGCTGGAAGATG), Q11A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGGCGATCAAACGGCCGCTGGAAGATGC), or I12A (5′-CGGGATCCGAAATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGGCCAAACGGCCGCTGGAAGATGCCATC). The resulting fragments were digested with BamH1 and XbaI and inserted into pcDNA3. Subsequently, a 3.5-kilobase XbaI fragment encoding the 3′ end of the coding region of FOG-2 (1208–4770 bp) from pcDNA FOG-2 was inserted into the XbaI site to generate the final construct. Expression constructs for the FOG-2/GAL4 fusions were generated as follows. A fragment encoding the N-terminal 132 amino acids of FOG-2 was amplified using the PCR and pcDNA FOG-2 as template with the following primers: 5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG and 5′-CGGAATTCTCCACCTCCACCTCCTAGAGCTCGGGCATTGGAAAAGC. This fragment was inserted into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pcDNA3. To generate the 1–18, 1–12, and 1–12K5A FOG-2/GAL4 fusions, the following double-stranded oligonucleotides were cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pcDNA3: 1–18, 5′-GATCCAGCATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCAAACGGCCGCTGGAAGATGAATTC; 1–12, 5′-GATCCAGCATGTCCCGGCGAAAGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCGAATTC; 1–12K5A, 5′-GATCCAGCATGTCCCGGCGAGCGCAGAGTAAACCCCGGCAGATCGAATTC. Subsequently, the PCR and primers 5′-GCGAATTCAAGATGAAGCTACTGTCTTCTATCG and 5′-GCTCTAGACGATACAGTCAACTGTCTTTGACC were used to generate a fragment of the GAL4 DNA binding domain from pSG424 (34Sadowski I. Ptashne M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7539Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). This fragment was inserted into the EcoRI-XbaI site of each of the above plasmids to generate expression vectors for each FOG-2/GAL4 fusion protein. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfections—Murine NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Twenty-hours before transfection, 1.5 × 105 cells were plated onto a 12-well plate and cultured overnight. On the day of transfection, 300 ng of reporter plasmid (p-638 ANF GH), 60 ng of pVRβGal, 300 ng of pcDNA GATA4, 150 ng of pcDNA FOG-2 or FOG-2 mutants and pcDNA3 to a total of 1.5 μg of DNA was mixed with 3 μl of Superfect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 75 μl of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) and added to cells with 0.4 ml of growth medium. For the GAL4-FOG-2 fusion experiments, 600 ng of reporter plasmid (pSV40Gal4-Luc), 60 ng of pVRβGal, 150 ng of pcDNA GAL4/FOG-2, and 690 ng of pcDNA were used. Three hours after the addition of the DNA/Superfect mixture, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and 1 ml of growth medium was added. A 200 mm tricostatin A (Sigma) stock solution was prepared in Me2SO. For the indicated experiments, 25 h after transfection cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fresh growth media along with an appropriate volume of tricostatin A or Me2SO alone was added. Reporter Assays—Forty-eight hours after transfection, medium was harvested. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and then 0.3 ml of 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to the cells. After a 15-min incubation at room temperature, cells were scraped from the plate, lysis buffer was removed, and cell debris was pelleted. Five μl of this lysate was used in a Bradford protein assay to determine protein concentration (Bio-Rad). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in each cell lysate by mixing 15 μl of lysate with 85 μlof 1× reporter lysis buffer and 100 μl of 2× β-galactosidase assay buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactoside) and incubating at 37 °C in a Molecular Devices 96-well microtiter plate reader, with absorbance at 420 nm, read every 60 s. Relative β-galactosidase activity was taken as the change in absorbance over time and normalized to the total protein concentration in the lysate. Luciferase activity was determined using 20 μl of cell lysate and 100 μl of luciferin (Promega) and measured in a TD-20/20 luminometer. Human growth hormone (hGH) was measured using 1–5 μl of cell media and a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Roche Applied Science). Relative promoter activity was calculated as the hGH concentration divided by the relative β-galactosidase activity. FOG-2-mediated Repression of GATA4 Activity Is HDAC-independent—As a first step in characterizing the nature of the repression domain of FOG-2, we used the HDAC inhibitor, tricostatin A (TSA), to determine the dependence of FOG-2 on HDAC activity. Tricostatin A has been previously shown to inhibit both class I and class II HDACs and relieve transcriptional repression mediated through HDAC-dependent pathways (35Yoshida M. Matsuyama A. Komatsu Y. Nishino N. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 2351-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 36Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar). As we have shown previously, FOG-2 is an effective repressor of GATA4-mediated transactivation of the ANF promoter in cultured fibroblasts (Fig. 1, first and second bars). The addition of TSA from 50 to 200 nm had no effect on the ability of FOG-2 to repress GATA4 transactivation of the ANF promoter (Fig. 1, third through fifth bars). These results support the notion that FOG-2 represses transcription though an HDAC-independent pathway in murine fibroblasts. Conservation of the N-terminal Amino Acids of FOG Proteins—Our previous work had demonstrated that both murine FOG-1 and FOG-2 were capable of repressing GATA4 transactivation of the ANF promoter and that this repression required the N termini of each protein (28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fusion protein analysis between the DNA binding domain of GAL4 and the N terminus of FOG-2 demonstrated that the N-terminal 45 amino acids were sufficient to mediate transcriptional repression in a heterologous system (28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To further refine the repression domain within the first 45 amino acids of FOG proteins, we reasoned that the amino acids within this domain critical for repression might be conserved in sequence across species. To identify such residues, we first searched the NCBI genomic and EST data base for the sequences of FOG proteins from other species. We identified genomic or cDNA sequence encoding the N-terminal amino acids of FOG-2 from both human and cow sequences. For FOG-1, we identified sequences from human, cow, chicken, frog, and zebra finch. Fig. 2 shows the alignment of amino acid sequences obtained from conceptual translation of these genomic and cDNA fragments. As can be seen, 14 of the first 16 residues are identical in all of these proteins, suggesting that the amino acids critical for repression lie in the first 16 amino acids of the FOG proteins. Fine Mapping of the Critical Residues in the N Terminus of FOG-2—To test the importance of the conserved region of the N terminus of FOG-2 for transcriptional repression, we generated a mammalian expression construct encoding a murine FOG-2 protein that lacked amino acids 2–18 and then tested the ability of this protein to repress GATA4-dependent transactivation in a transient transfection assay as described previously (18Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 28Svensson E.C. Huggins G.S. Dardik F.B. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20762-20769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 3B, the elimination of amino acids 2–18 completely abrogated the ability of FOG-2 to repress transcription (compare the second and third bars, p < 0.001). This result demonstrates that the first 18 amino acids are required for FOG-2 mediated repression. To further characterize the N-terminal repression domain, we generated expression constructs encoding alanine substitutions in amino acids 2–6, 7–12, or 13–18 of murine FOG-2. These proteins were also tested for their ability to repress GATA4 transactivation as shown in Fig. 3B. Alanine substitution of amino acids 2–6 or 7–12 resulted in complete loss of repression by FOG-2 (Fig. 3B, fourth and fifth bars), whereas substitution of amino acids 13–18 had no statistically significant effect in FOG-2 mediated repression (Fig. 3B, second and sixth bars, p = 0.41). These results further narrowed the critical region to the first 12 amino acids. To test each residue individually, we generated expression constructs encoding single alanine substitutions in residues 2–12 (Fig. 4). Substitution of amino acid 3 (R3A), 4 (R4A), or 5 (K5A) resulted in a complete loss of repression by FOG-2, whereas substitution of amino acids 2, 7, 8, 10, or 11 had no significant effect on repressive activity (p > 0.05). Mutation of amino acids 6, 9, and 12 resulted in a partial loss of repression that was statistically significant (p = 0.0002, 0.0001, and 0.0001, respectively). Given the potency of FOG-2 as a transcriptional repressor, very little FOG-2 expression was necessary to achieve complete repression. As a consequence, expression of these constructs could not be reliably detected by Western analysis of transfected cell lysate. However, all constructs were shown to program expression of FOG-2 in 3T3 fibroblasts when transfected at high levels (data not shown). These results suggest that amino acids 3–6, 9, and 12 are required for FOG-2 mediated repression. Importantly, these amino acids are all completely conserved in FOG proteins across species as shown in Fig. 2. The N-terminal 12 Amino Acids Are Sufficient to Mediate Transcriptional Repression—To determine whether the critical repression motif of FOG proteins identified above is sufficient to mediate transcriptional repression, we generated mammalian expression vectors encoding the first 132, 18, or 12 amino acids of FOG-2 fused to the DNA binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Fig. 5A). These constructs were transiently transfected into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts along with a reporter plasmid containing the luciferase gene under the control of a modified SV40 promoter with four copies of the GAL4 DNA binding elements. Consistent with our past observations, when the first 132 amino acids of FOG-2 were fused to GAL4, the resulting fusion protein was an effective transcriptional repressor, inhibiting SV40 promoter activity by 78 ± 9% (Fig. 5B, first and second bars). Similar results were obtained using just the first 18 amino acids of FOG-2 (Fig. 5B, third bar)orthe first 12 amino acids (Fig. 5, fourth bar). Furthermore, a fusion protein containing the first 12 amino acids of FOG-2 with an alanine substitution at position 5 (1–12 K5A) is unable to significantly repress the SV40 promoter (Fig. 5B, fifth bar) despite similar levels of protein expression to the wild-type construct (data not shown). Taken together, these results define the critical repression motif in the N terminus of FOG proteins as RRKQxxPxxI. Identification of the FOG Repression Motif in Other Transcriptional Repressors—With the critical residues of the FOG repression motif defined, we searched the NCBI data base for any other proteins that might contain this motif. The results are shown in Fig. 6. We identified 14 proteins from multiple vertebrate species that contain this motif. Of note, this motif was not found in proteins from the Drosophila or yeast genomes. Interestingly, all of the proteins identified in this search contain zinc finger domains, and many have been previously characterized as transcriptional repressors (37Avram D. Fields A. Pretty On Top K. Nevrivy D.J. Ishmael J.E. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 38Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 39Tsai R.Y. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the FOG repression motif in all of these proteins is at the very N terminus of each protein. Finally, all of the critical residues identified in Fig. 5 with the exception of the isoleucine at residue 12 were conserved in all the proteins. At position 12, several of the identified proteins had a conservative substitution of leucine for isoleucine or other hydrophobic amino acids such as valine or phenylalanine. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the FOG repression motif is found in other zinc finger-containing transcriptional repressors and, thus, define a novel vertebrate superfamily of zinc finger transcriptional repressors that would include members of both the FOG and Spalt families. In this report, we have further characterized the N-terminal repression domain of FOG-2 and have uncovered a novel repression motif found in both FOG-1 and FOG-2 that is conserved across vertebrate species. In addition, we have identified this motif in other transcriptional repressors, suggesting that this motif may be utilized as a general mechanism of transcriptional repression. This pathway appears to work through an HDAC-independent mechanism, as tricostatin A, a general HDAC inhibitor, was unable to block repression mediated by FOG-2. It is still possible that the FOG repression motif may function in chromatin remodeling by the blocking of histone acetyltransferases or the activation of histone methyltransferases. This motif may also function either by interacting directly with the basal transcriptional machinery or RNA polymerase itself or recruiting a currently unidentified co-repressor to the promoter complex. Experiments are currently under way to address this question. The N terminus of FOG-1 has been previously shown to be required for megakaryocyte development (40Cantor A.B. Katz S.G. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4268-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Using an in vitro hematopoietic differentiation assay with FOG-1-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells, Cantor et al. (40Cantor A.B. Katz S.G. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4268-4279Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the N-terminal 144 amino acids of FOG-1 is not required for rescue of erythropoiesis in the differentiation of FOG-deficient ES cells but is critical for megakaryocyte production from these cells. This result in combination with the work presented in this report suggests that the FOG repression motif may play a role in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation. This observation also suggests that the FOG repression motif may not be utilized in all developmental processes (e.g. erythropoiesis) for which FOG proteins are required. In Drosophila there is only one FOG family protein, U-shaped (14Fossett N. Tevosian S.G. Gajewski K. Zhang Q. Orkin S.H. Schulz R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7342-7347Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 41Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P.

A. 2003; 100: 11451-11456Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This protein has been demonstrated to act as a genetic repressor of the GATA factor pannier and be critical for normal heart development in the fly. As in other FOG proteins, U-shaped contains a consensus binding site for CtBP and can physically interact with CtBP in vitro. However, U-shaped does not have the FOG repression motif identified in this report. Consistent with this observation, transient transfection assays suggest that U-shaped only weakly represses GATA4-mediated transactivation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. 2E. C. Svensson, unpublished results. Moreover, we were unable to identify any protein in the Drosophila genome that contained this motif. In contrast, this motif was detected in proteins from frog, chicken, mouse, rat, cow, and human proteomes. Taken together, these observations suggest that the mechanism of repression utilized by the FOG repression motif may be restricted to vertebrates. Many of the proteins that contain the FOG repression motif (Fig. 6) have been previously identified to be transcriptional repressors. For example, zinc finger protein 423 (early B-cell zinc finger transcription factor or Roaz) is a multi-zinc finger protein that binds DNA directly and represses the activation of olfactory-specific genes by O/E-1 (39Tsai R.Y. Reed R.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4159-4169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCL11b (also known as chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II-interacting protein 1) is also a zinc finger-containing protein that functions as a transcriptional repressor (37Avram D. Fields A. Pretty On Top K. Nevrivy D.J. Ishmael J.E. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10315-10322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). It has been shown to contain two repression domains, one of which is localized to the N-terminal 171 amino acids. The FOG repression motif is encoded by the N-terminal 12 amino acids in this protein, so it is possible that this motif is responsible for the repression activity described for this domain. Consistent with our observations with FOG-2, the repression mediated by the N terminus of BCL11b is TSA insensitive. Finally, the transcriptional repressor SALL1 is another example of a zinc finger transcriptional repressor that contains the FOG repression motif. SALL1 is critical for the development of the kidney, and mutations in SALL1 cause Townes-Brocks syndrome in humans (44Nishinakamura R. Matsumoto Y. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Sato A. Copeland N.G.

Genet. 2003; 12: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Previous work on this protein demonstrated that the repression domain was localized to the N-terminal 130 amino acids (46Kiefer S.M. Ohlemiller K.K. Yang J. McDill B.W. Kohlhase J. Rauchman M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As with BCL11b, the FOG repression motif of SALL1 is localized to the very N terminus of the protein. In contrast to FOG-2 and BCL11b, the N-terminal 130 amino acids of SALL1 were shown to interact with HDAC1 and 2, but the repression mediated by this domain was only partially blocked by the HDAC inhibitor TSA (38Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 46Kiefer S.M. Ohlemiller K.K. Yang J. McDill B.W. Kohlhase J. Rauchman M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2221-2227Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was postulated that this domain might repress transcription by two distinct mechanisms, one that is HDAC-dependent and the other by an HDAC-independent mechanism. Given the finding of a FOG repression motif within this domain, the HDAC-independent mechanism likely functions through this motif. As the genomes of other species are sequenced and characterized, it is possible that other proteins containing the FOG repression motif will be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1999519277,"Zinc is essential for many cellular processes, and its concentration in the cell must be tightly controlled. The Zrt/IRT-like protein (ZIP) family of zinc transporters have recently been identified as the main regulators of zinc influx into the cytoplasm (1Eng B.H. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); however, little is known about their in vivo roles. Previously, we have shown that fear of intimacy (foi) encodes a putative member of the ZIP family that is essential for development in Drosophila (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that FOI can act as an ion transporter in both yeast and mammalian cell assays and is specific for zinc. We also provide insight into the mechanism of action of the ZIP family through membrane topology and structure-function analyses of FOI. Our work demonstrates that Drosophila FOI is closely related to mammalian ZIP proteins at the functional level and that Drosophila represents an ideal system for understanding the in vivo roles of this family. In addition, this work indicates that the control of zinc by ZIP transporters may play a critical role in regulating developmental processes.

Our work demonstrates that Drosophila FOI is closely related to mammalian ZIP proteins at the functional level and that Drosophila represents an ideal system for understanding the in vivo roles of this family. In addition, this work indicates that the control of zinc by ZIP transporters may play a critical role in regulating developmental processes. Zinc is an essential ion for many diverse cellular processes and can be a co-factor or structural component for many types of proteins. The regulation of cellular zinc concentration is crucial, because both zinc deficiency and excess can be detrimental to cells. In humans, a zinc deficiency can cause major health problems such as growth retardation, and defects in the immune system, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract function (3Hambidge M. J. Nutr. 2000; 130: 1344-1349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ion transporters belonging to either of two protein families regulate cellular zinc levels: the Zrt/IRT-like protein (ZIP) 1The abbreviations used are: ZIP, Zrt/IRT-like protein; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; IRT, iron-responsive transporter; TM, transmembrane; Zrt, zinc-responsive transporter; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; h, human; m, mouse; UAS, upstream activating sequence. 1The abbreviations used are: ZIP, Zrt/IRT-like protein; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; IRT, iron-responsive transporter; TM, transmembrane; Zrt, zinc-responsive transporter; HA, hemagglutinin; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; h, human; m, mouse; UAS, upstream activating sequence. family (1Eng B.H.

Membr. Biol. 1997; 156: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). ZIP proteins are involved in zinc influx to the cytoplasm from the plasma membrane or intracellular organelles, whereas the complementary CDF proteins efflux zinc from the cytoplasm to membrane-bound compartments or outside the cell. The ZIP family was named after its first identified members Zrt1 (5Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) and Zrt2 (6Zhao H.

Several features define members of the ZIP family, including a conserved transmembrane structure and a highly conserved “signature sequence,” also known as the HELP domain in some family members (see Fig. 1B). Some ZIP proteins have been shown to transport zinc specifically (5Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 6Zhao H. Eide D. J.

Clark W.G. Guerinot M.L. Pakrasi H.B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Currently, little is known about the in vivo roles of these zinc transporters, particularly in the animal kingdom. Recent work indicates that careful regulation of zinc homeostasis is likely to be essential for proper embryonic development and in disease prevention. Human ZIP4 (SLC39A4) has been identified as the gene mutated in the genetic disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica (13Kury S. Dreno B. Bezieau S. Giraudet S. Kharfi M. Kamoun R. Moisan J.P. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 239-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 14Wang K. Zhou B. Kuo Y.M. Zemansky J. Gitschier J. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2002; 71: 66-73Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), which results in epidermal lesions, gastrointestinal defects, and infant mortality. These symptoms mimic those associated with dietary zinc deficiencies and can be treated with high doses of dietary zinc. The mouse homolog mZIP4 can act as a zinc transporter (10Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), and when mutations found in acrodermatitis enteropathica patients are introduced into mZIP4 they affect the subcellular localization or transport function of the protein (15Wang F. Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, defective zinc transport by hZIP4 is likely the cause of acrodermatitis enteropathica, although it remains unclear how these defects in zinc transport contribute to the physiological symptoms observed in acrodermatitis enteropathica patients. The first ZIP family member identified as critical during development is encoded by the Drosophila gene, fear of intimacy (foi). foi is required for the proper formation of the embryonic gonad, which gives rise to either the testis or ovary, and the tracheal system, which forms the respiratory system of Drosophila larvae (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In both of these processes, FOI is essential for establishment of proper tissue architecture but is not required for cell identity. Thus, during Drosophila development, foi appears to play a specific role in the morphogenesis of these tissues. Recently, another ZIP family member was also shown to play an essential developmental role; Zebrafish LIV-1 is essential for the proper cell movements during gastrulation (16Yamashita S. Miyagi C. Fukada T. Kagara N. Che Y.S. Hirano T. Nature. 2004; 429: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Therefore, two known in vivo roles of ZIP family members involve the regulation of tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development. If ZIP family members in these model systems function similarly to their mammalian counterparts, they will provide an excellent resource for understanding how zinc transporters act in vivo to regulate development and physiology. To determine whether Drosophila FOI is a bona fide ZIP protein capable of transporting zinc, we conducted an extensive characterization of the FOI protein. In this paper, we investigate the membrane topology of FOI under conditions where we can verify that the protein retains full biological activity. We demonstrate that FOI can function as a zinc transporter in both yeast and mammalian cells and has similar ion specificity to its mammalian counterparts. Finally, we present a structure-function analysis of FOI that provides insight into the mechanism of action of the ZIP family. Our work indicates that Drosophila ZIP family members are likely to be highly similar in function to mammalian ZIP proteins. Plasmids—Yeast plasmids pFL61, pMC5 (pFL61-yZRT1), and pA6 (pFL61-aZIP1) are as in Ref. 7Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These constructs were subcloned into pUAST using the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites for expression in Drosophila S2 cells and embryos. The C-terminal HA-FOI construct was subcloned into pCMV-sport6 (Invitrogen) using EcoRI and NotI for expression in mammalian cells and into pFL61 (17Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) via a PCR strategy to generate NotI restriction sites in FOI for expression in yeast. The following site-directed mutations were introduced into the C-terminal HA-FOI construct using QuikChange (Stratagene): D308A, H554A, E584A/E588A/D591A, and Y646A. The ΔN mutation was generated by introducing two unique AscI sites in the N terminus of FOI using QuikChange to delete amino acids Asp23-Asp254 (Q22GRAK255). All of the mutated versions of FOI were subcloned into pCMV-sport6 and pFL61 for expression in mammalian and yeast cells, respectively. All cloning strategies are available upon request. Fly Stocks and Transgenic Animals—ru st faf lacZ e ca flies were used as wild-type. Transgenic Drosophila were generated for each of the three UAS-HA-FOI constructs described above using standard genomic transformation methods (18Rubin G.M. Spradling A.C. Science. 1982; 218: 348-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (2330) Google Scholar). UAS-HA-FOI constructs were expressed using the Gal4 transcriptional activator localized to either the mesoderm (twist-Gal4 (19Baylies M.K. Bate M. Science. 1996; 272: 1481-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar)) or trachea (breathless-Gal4 (20Shiga Y. Tanaka-Matakatsu M. Hayashi S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1996; 38: 99-106Crossref Scopus (228) Google Scholar)). Rescue experiments were conducted with two independent UAS-HA-FOI transgenic lines in a genetic background lacking endogenous foi activity (foi20.71), as described previously (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At least 40 hemi-embryos were analyzed for each genotype. Computer Analysis of Sequence Data—Multiple sequence alignments and a phylogenetic tree were constructed using Clustal in the Laser-gene software (DNAStar, Inc). We considered residues conserved within a subfamily or group if 80% of its members share an identical amino acid not found in proteins of the other subfamily or group. Transmembrane domain predictions were performed using the programs listed in Table I, N-linked glycosylation predictions were computed using PROSITE (21Sigrist C.J. Cerutti L. Hulo N. Gattiker A.

The protein was labeled with [35S]Met (Amersham Biosciences) and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Samples were treated with endoglycosidase H (Endo H) (Calbiochem), as done previously (38Tu L. Wang J. Helm A. Skach W.R. Deutsch C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 824-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), to remove N-linked sugars. Briefly, 15 μl of lysate, 4 μl of 5× reaction buffer (250 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0), and 1 μl of Denaturing solution (2% SDS, 1 m β-mercaptoethanol) were heated at 100 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. 1 μl of Endo H was added prior to incubation overnight at 37 °C. S2 cell extracts were prepared by homogenizing the cells in 17 μl of denaturing buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. Prior to incubating overnight at 37 °C, 2 μl of reaction buffer and 1 μl of Endo H were added. After spinning the lysate at 14,000 for 5 min, 30-35 μg of protein was loaded onto an SDS polyacrylamide gel, and a Western blot was performed essentially as described previously (39Baggett J.J. D'Aquino K.E. Wendland B. Genetics. 2003; 165: 1661-1674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Drosophila S2 cells were cultured at room temperature in Schneider's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected as described previously (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Briefly, UAS-HA-FOI constructs were co-transfected with an actin-Gal 4 (gift from K. Howard) using Cellfectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HEK293 cells were cultured under 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells (2 × 105) were seeded in 24-well poly-l-lysine-coated plates and transfected with the pCMV-Sport6 vector or pCMV-Sport6 expressing FOI (wild-type or mutant). Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies were typically 60%. Between 36 and 48 h after transfection, the cells were used for zinc uptake assays or Western blots (15Wang F. Kim B.E. Dufner-Beattie J. Petris M.J. Andrews G. Eide D.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 563-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Immunolabeling of S2 cells with permeabilization was done essentially as described previously (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For immunolabeling of HEK293 with permeabilization, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with 0.25% NH4Cl in PBS, the cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated with primary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with secondary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. For immunolabeling without permeabilization, S2 and HEK293 cells were incubated with primary antibody in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at 4 °C prior to fixation. Cells were then washed in PBS, and fixation and secondary antibody labeling was conducted as with permeabilized cells. Primary antibody and dyes used include mouse anti-HA (Roche Diagnostics, 0.8 μg/ml) and the nuclear dyes 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (2 μg/ml) and OliGreen (Molecular Probes, 1:10,000). Alexa-Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) were used at a 1:500 dilution according to manufacturer's instructions. Cells were mounted in 70% glycerol containing 2.5% 1,4-diaza-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma) and analyzed by either a Deltavision Deconvolution or Zeiss LSM 510 Meta Confocal microscope. Yeast Complementation Assays—The following yeast strains were used, ZHY3 (MATα zrt1::LEU2 zrt2::HIS3 ade6 can1 his3 leu2 trp1 ura3) and DY1459 (6Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Cultures were selectively grown overnight in liquid minimal medium to an A600 of 0.6-1.0 and diluted to an A600 of 0.25. Serial 1:5 dilutions were made in rich medium and were spotted onto selective minimal solid medium. Plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C prior to analysis. 65Zinc Uptake Assays—Zinc assays were performed essentially as described previously (10Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Parallel experiments were conducted with empty vector (pCMV-sport6) to measure endogenous 65Zn uptake rate, which was subtracted from the rate of 65Zn uptake in cells expressing FOI (wild-type or mutant) to obtain net zinc uptake values. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured with a Packard Auto-Gamma 5650-counter. Cells grown in parallel to those used for uptake experiments were washed three times with ice-cold uptake buffer, resuspended in PBS buffer containing 0.1% SDS and 1% Triton X-100 for cell lysis, and then assayed for protein content using a Bradford assay kit (Bio-Rad). Zinc accumulation and uptake rates were normalized to the protein concentrations of these cell lysates. Metal salts were obtained from Sigma and prepared as described previously (10Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F. Kuo Y.M. Gitschier J. Eide D. Andrews G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33474-33481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Michaelis-Menten constants were determined by nonlinear interpolation of the data, using Prism (version 4.0a for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). FOI Is a Member of the ZIP Family of Ion Transporters—To determine the relationship of FOI to the ZIP family, we compared the FOI protein sequence to other family members. Eukaryotic members of the ZIP family can be divided into the ZIP I/II and LIV-1 subfamilies (Fig. 1A (40Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar)) based on several conserved features, including the extended, histidine-rich N terminus of the LIV-1 subfamily (Fig. 1B). These subfamilies have further diverged into individual groups, the ZIP I/II subfamily into the ZIP I and ZIP II groups (40Gaither L.A. Eide D.J. Biometals. 2001; 14: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) and the LIV-1 subfamily into the LIV-1A and LIV-1B groups (Fig. 1A). These divergences are most obvious within the signature sequence domain, also referred to as the HELP domain in the LIV-1 subfamily, where individual groups can be defined by conservation of characteristic amino acids (Fig. 1C). Additional group-specific residues are found in other domains, such as in transmembrane domains (TM) 2 and 7 (Fig. 1C). Interestingly, Drosophila ZIP family members are found within each group that contains a mammalian ZIP family member (Fig. 1A). Individual Drosophila proteins are more closely related to their mammalian homologs than to other Drosophila ZIP family members (Fig. 1, A and B). This indicates that the distinct groups within the ZIP family existed prior to the divergence of vertebrate and invertebrate lineages. FOI is a member of the LIV-1A group within the LIV-1 subfamily, and is closely related to the human and mouse LIV-1 and ZIP4 proteins. Divergence in the signature sequence domain observed between the two ZIP subfamilies leads to differences in the predicted membrane topology in this region. Although computer algorithms generally agree about the predicted TM character of TM1-3 and TM6-8 throughout the ZIP family (Table I), the topology of the signature sequence remains unclear. This domain is variably predicted to form 0, 1, or 2 TM domains, depending on the protein and prediction program used (for consistency with the literature, we have counted this domain as TM4 and TM5). Generally, members of the ZIP I/II subfamily are predicted to have 2 TM domains within their signature sequence domain. In human ZIP1, this region is calculated to form 2 TM domains by ten of twelve computer algorithms used (Table I). TM predictions in this region are much less consistent for members of the LIV-1 subfamily, such as hLIV-1 (41Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and FOI. For FOI, five algorithms predict 0 TM domains, five predict 1 TM domain, and two predict 2 TM domains in this region. Thus, it is critical to determine the actual membrane topology of ZIP family members in vivo. FOI Has Extracellular N and C Termini—We wanted to experimentally address the membrane topology of FOI using a full-length functional protein. To do this, a 3× HA-epitope tag was inserted into the N terminus, middle (after TM3), or C terminus of FOI (Fig. 1B), and these constructs were transfected into cultured Drosophila S2 cells. Immunolabeling with an anti-HA antibody revealed that N-terminal HA-FOI could be detected in both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells (Fig. 2A). Because only extracellular epitopes can be immunolabeled in non-permeabilized cells, this indicates that the N terminus of FOI is extracellular. The middle region of FOI was detected only after permeabilization, confirming that this large, unconserved loop is cytoplasmic (Fig. 2A). The predictions for the localization of the C terminus of FOI vary depending on the number of TMs in the signature sequence. If this region contains a single TM, and TM6-8 are as predicted, the C terminus of FOI should be intracellular. If the signature sequence contains 0 or 2 TMs, the C terminus should be extracellular. We found that the C-terminal HA-FOI construct could be detected in both permeabilized and non-permeabilized cells, indicating that it is extracellular. Thus, the signature sequence is unlikely to have a single TM and likely has either 0 or 2 TM domains (Fig. 2B). To confirm that the HA-tagged versions of FOI retain biological activity, we tested the ability of each of these constructs to supply FOI function in vivo in a transgenic rescue assay (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). foi mutant embryos have defects in gonad coalescence, in which the cells of the gonad fail to properly associate with one another, and in trachea formation, in which some tracheal branches fail to connect correctly with neighboring branches (2Van Doren M. Mathews W.R. Samuels M. Moore L.A. Broihier H.T. Lehmann R. Development. 2003; 130: 2355-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 42Jenkins A.B. McCaffery J.M. Van Doren M. Development. 2003; 130: 4417-4426Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Expression of each HA-tagged version of FOI in the appropriate tissue was able to fully rescue the gonad and tracheal defects normally observed in foi mutants (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, insertion of the HA-tag in the N terminus, middle, or C terminus of FOI does not disrupt the ability of the protein to function in vivo, indicating that the tagged proteins accurately represent the membrane topology of the wild-type FOI protein. The N Terminus of FOI Is Glycosylated—FOI contains eight consensus N-glycosylation sites, six on the N terminus, one between TM3 and TM4, and one in the signature sequence domain (Fig. 1B). To determine which, if any, of these sites are glycosylated, we translated FOI in vitro in the presence or absence of canine microsomal membranes, which allow for co-translational processing of the protein. In the presence of microsomes, FOI was detected at both the predicted, unprocessed size and at a higher molecular mass (Fig. 3A). The larger protein was Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 3A) indicating that FOI can be glycosylated in vitro. To confirm that FOI is a glycoprotein in vivo, we expressed HA-tagged FOI in Drosophila S2 cells. Again, FOI was observed at two molecular masses, the larger of which is Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 3B) confirming that FOI is a glycoprotein (in contrast to mammalian cells, mature glycoproteins in insects are often Endo H-sensitive (43Tomiya N. Betenbaugh M.J. Lee Y.C. Acc. Chem. Res. 2003; 36: 613-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)). To determine whether glycosylation occurs on the N terminus of FOI, we deleted the entire N terminus (ΔN) and translated the resulting protein in vitro. The ΔN protein was detected at approximately the same molecular mass in both the presence and absence of microsomes and was not Endo H-sensitive (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the N terminus is the only region of FOI that is glycosylated, further indicating that this domain is extracellular and that the unglycosylated region of the protein between TM3 and TM4 is cytoplasmic. FOI Functions as a Zinc Transporter in Both Yeast and Mammalian Cells—We next wanted to determine whether FOI can function as a zinc transporter and is therefore a true member of the ZIP family. Mammalian LIV-1 subfamily members have been shown to affect intracellular zinc accumulation (41Taylor K.M. Morgan H.E. Johnson A. Hadley L.J. Nicholson R.I. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 44Begum N.A. Kobayashi M. Moriwaki Y. Matsumoto M. Toyoshima K. Seya T. Genomics. 2002; 80: 630-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), and for mZIP4 and mZIP5, this has been demonstrated to be due to an increased rate of zinc uptake (10Dufner-Beattie J. Wang F.

We have designed a complex immunogen derived from the extracellular domain of human HER-2/neu-(626–649) that represents a three-dimensional epitope. We have successfully introduced two disulfide bonds into this sequence, thereby recapitulating the natural disulfide pairings observed in the native protein. To evaluate the immunogenicity of the doubly cyclized disulfide-linked peptide versus the free uncyclized peptide we examined the induction of antibody responses in both inbred and outbred mice strains, with both constructs eliciting high titered antibodies. The disulfide-paired specific antibodies exhibited enhanced cross-reactivity to HER-2/neu expressed on BT-474 cell line as determined by flow cytometry. The antitumor activities of the disulfidepaired specific antibodies did not improve the in vitro growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells overexpressing HER-2, but showed superior antitumor responses in the context of ADCC and interferon-γ induction. Inbred mice (FVB/n) vaccinated with the disulfide-paired epitope exhibited a statistically significant reduction in the development of exogenously administered tumors in vivo compared with mice receiving either the free uncyclized or the promiscuous T-cell epitope (MVF) control peptide (p = 0.001).

The fact that patients are capable of mounting even weak immune responses is extremely promising for it suggests that it may be possible to overcome tolerance through vaccination. Substantial evidence exists that immunizing with peptides derived from self-antigens may be an effective means of circumventing tolerance (9Reilly R.T. Gottlieb M.B. Ercolini A.M. Machiels J.P.

This finding has important implications in HER-2 cancer therapy; it suggests that vaccination may be an effective means of either initiating or boosting antitumor immunity. Equally promising, the autoimmunity provoked by vaccination seems to be tumor-restricted as signs of autoimmune disease are not detected in other tissues expressing physiological levels of HER-2 (13Disis M.L.

However, there remain a number of concerns such as repeated treatments and associated costs, limited duration of therapeutic effectiveness, and possibly undesired immunogenicity. Therefore, a therapeutic approach capable of inducing active specific immunity would prove to be highly advantageous, offering sustained protection at a lower cost, preventive therapy, and long term immunity. The rationale for active immunization stems from observations made both clinically and in animal models, suggesting that specific immunotherapy may be a more desirable way to target HER-2 positive cancers. One of the earliest observations supporting the possibility of active immunotherapy was reported by Tang et al. (18Tang R.P. Kacinski B. Validire P. Beuvon F. Sastre X. Benoit P. dela-Rochefordiere A. Mosseri V. Pouillart P. Scholl S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), whose studies indicated that there was a correlation between HER-2 gene amplification and the presence of dense lymphocytic infiltration in breast tumors (18Tang R.P. Kacinski B. Validire P. Beuvon F. Sastre X. Benoit P. dela-Rochefordiere A. Mosseri V. Pouillart P. Scholl S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 44: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This observation re-enforced the idea that there may be an endogenous immune response to tumor despite immunological tolerance. Vaccine strategies based on peptides have targeted either the cytolytic CD8+ T lymphocyte arm of the immune response or the induction of tumor-specific humoral immune response. Several cytolytic CD8+ T lymphocyte epitopes of HER-2/neu have been defined and tested in clinical trials (19Brossart P. Wirths S. Stuhler G. Reichardt V.L. Kanz L. Brugger W. Blood. 2000; 96: 3102-3108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Knutson K.L. Schiffman K. Disis M.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2001; 107: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has focused on elucidating the antigenic potential of the ECD of HER-2/neu by mapping several regions of the human protein and testing their in vitro and in vivo biological activities. We reported the anti-tumor properties of a chimeric B-cell epitope sequence 628–647 that incorporates a promiscuous T-cell epitope (MVF) (12Dakappagari N.K. Douglas D.B. Triozzi P.L. Stevens V.C. Kaumaya P.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3782-3789PubMed Google Scholar, 21Dakappagari N.K. Pyles J. Parihar R. Carson W.E. Young D.C. Kaumaya P.T. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4242-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This peptide construct was highly immunogenic in both outbred rabbits and inbred mice, prevented the development of HER-2/neu-overexpressing mammary tumors in 83% of vaccinated rat neu transgenic mice (12Dakappagari N.K. Douglas D.B. Triozzi P.L. Stevens V.C. Kaumaya P.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3782-3789PubMed Google Scholar), and was tested in an National Institutes of Health NCI sponsored Phase Ib clinical trial at the Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital. We have extended our studies by defining several other important regions of the extracellular domain of HER-2 as potential targets and a multivalent construct is presently being tested in a Phase I trial (OSU 0105). It is well established from three-dimensional structures of antigen-antibody complexes that antigenic epitopes are conformational and, as such, vaccine design should attempt to incorporate such parameters so that antibodies of high affinity can be elicited. Our original peptide 628–647 was designed to avoid the complications of disulfide pairings. Now that the S-S pairings in human EGFR has been defined (22Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and knowing the homology of EGFR to HER-2, we hypothesize that a new construct (626–649) with the known S-S pairing should elicit higher affinity antibodies than our originally designed construct, as the new construct should mimic the native structure better. Engineering peptides to adopt defined structure offers two important advantages. First, a structurally defined peptide is more desirable because it will present a single, stable determinant, unlike synthetic linear peptides that exist in a multitude of different conformations in solution. As such, a more focused response is elicited giving rise to a restricted, perhaps single population of peptide antibodies. Second, conformational peptide epitopes will give rise to antibodies of high affinity, able to cross-react more effectively with the native receptor, thereby killing the tumor or neutralizing the virus. The pairing of disulfide bonds is an effective means of conformationally stabilizing peptides. There are 50 cysteine residues in the extracellular domain of HER-2 and EGFR, all of which are conserved between the two members (23Coussens L. Yang-Feng T.L. Liao Y.C. Chen E. Gray A. McGrath J. Seeburg P.H. Libermann T.A. Schlessinger J. Francke U. Levinson A. Ullrich A. Science. 1985; 230: 1132-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar, 24Siegel P.M. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A striking similarity is the presence of two cysteine-rich clusters, in which the spatial distribution of cysteine residues is virtually identical between the two receptors. The sequences of cysteine clusters are rather hydrophilic and were hypothesized to form a specific conformation capable of ligand binding and signal transmission (25Yamamoto T. Ikawa S. Akiyama T. Semba K. Nomura N. Miyajima N. Saito T. Toyoshima K. Nature. 1986; 319: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). All of the 25 disulfide bond connections in the extracellular domain of EGFR have been experimentally determined (22Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although there are a total of 50 cysteine residues across the HER-2 extracellular domain, only a few cysteines present in the membrane proximal region were found to spontaneously mutate both in rat neu transgenic mice and a small percentage of human tumors (26Siegel P.M. Ryan E.D. Cardiff R.D. Muller W.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2149-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 27Siegel P.M. Dankort D.L. Hardy W.R. Muller W.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7068-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These mutations were later shown to cause spontaneous dimerization of the receptor and when the mutant receptors were expressed as transgenes in mice, it lead to accelerated tumor formation and early death (24Siegel P.M. Muller W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8878-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These and other studies (28Kumagai T. Davis J.G. Horie T. O'Rourke D.M. Greene M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5526-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Berezov A. Chen J. Liu Q. Zhang H.T. Greene M.I. Murali R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28330-28339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) appear to indicate that the cysteines in the membrane proximal region appear to have special significance in the biology of the receptor. Therefore, we have focused our studies on a peptide sequence (amino acids 626–649) from this membrane proximal region. Therefore, it is possible to conformationally constrain the HER-2 B-cell epitope peptides by introducing the natural disulfide bonds. The introduced disulfide bonds may stabilize the secondary structure in the peptides and enable them to more closely mimic the native receptor. Antibodies generated against such conformationally constrained peptides would most likely have greater affinity for native HER-2. Based upon the known EGFR disulfide bond structure (22Abe Y. Odaka M. Inagaki F. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Kohda D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11150-11157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and its homology to HER-2, we redesigned HER-2 MVF-(628–647) by extending it two amino acids at each terminus. This newly designed sequence, designated HER-2-MVF626–649SS, contains four cysteine residues at 626, 630, 634, and 642 with the disulfide bonds between residues 626 and 634, and residues 630 and 642. To determine whether the cyclized epitope was able to mimic the native HER-2 better than the non-cyclized epitope MVF626–649NC, we studied the immunogenicity of both epitopes in outbred ICR mice. We evaluated the cross-reactivity of the two peptide antibodies by flow cytometry using human HER-2 overexpressing breast cancer cells, BT474. We assessed their direct and indirect antitumor activities by testing their antiproliferative capacity, as well as their ability to mediate ADCC and induce IFN-γ production, in vitro. Last, we determined the immunogenicity and immunoprotective effects of each vaccine in a mouse tumor burden model using an inbred mouse strain (FVB/n). We report here the successful design, synthesis, and characterization of a highly immunogenic conformationally defined HER-2 B-cell epitope, MVF-(626–649). The doubly disulfidepaired construct elicited high affinity antipeptide antibodies for native HER-2 compared with the corresponding uncyclized linear epitope. Additionally the antibodies elicited by the conformational epitope mediated higher levels of IFN-γ production by human PBMCs and demonstrated enhanced antibody-dependent cell lysis in vitro. Furthermore, a statistically significant reduction in tumor growth was observed in mice vaccinated with the disulfide-paired epitope relative to mice receiving either the linear construct or MVF control peptide (p = 0.001). Synthesis and Characterization of Conformational and Linear Peptides—HER-2 B-cell epitope 626–649 was synthesized co-linearly with a promiscuous TH epitope derived from the measles virus fusion protein (amino acids 288–302). Peptide synthesis was performed on a Milligen/Biosearch 9600 peptide solid-phase synthesizer (Bedford, MA) using Fmoc/t-But chemistry. Preloaded Fmoc-Ser-CLEAR ACID resin (0.36 mmol/g) (Peptides International, Louisville, KY) was used for the synthesis. The B-cell epitope (HER-2-(626–649)) was assembled by choosing regioselective side chain protection on Cys residues as: Cys(Acm) on 630 and 642, Cys(Trt) on 626 and 634. Also, MVF TH epitope with four reside linker (GPSL) was incorporated for independent folding and was assembled on the B-cell epitope. Both peptides were cleaved from the resin using the cleavage reagent B (trifluoroacetic acid:phenol:water: TIS, 90:4:4:2) and crude peptides were purified as reported earlier (30Sundaram R. Lynch M.P. Rawale S.V. Sun Y. Kazanji M. Kaumaya P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24141-24151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Intamolecular disulfide bonds were formed using either iodine oxidation as described by Soll et al. (31Soll R. Beck-Sickinger A.G. J. Pept. Sci. 2000; 6: 387-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or platinum oxidation (32Shi T. Rabenstein D.L. J. Org. Chem. 1999; 64: 4590-4595Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Linear peptide was generated by dithiothreitol reduction. Cyclic and linear peptides were further purified by semi-preparative RP-HPLC and characterized by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) (Campus Chemical Instrumentation Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). Disulfide bridge formation was further confirmed by Maleimide-PEO2-biotin reaction with cyclic and linear peptide and subsequent analysis using ESI-MS. Circular Dichroism (CD) Measurements—Aqueous solutions for CD were prepared by dissolving the freeze-dried peptide in the appropriate amount of water to give a final concentration of 0.5 mm and used as stock solution for further dilution. CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV model 62A DS CD instrument (Lakewood, NJ) as reported earlier (30Sundaram R. Lynch M.P. Rawale S.V. Sun Y. Kazanji M. Kaumaya P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24141-24151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Mean residue ellipticity ([θ]M,λ) values were calculated according to the equation, [θ]M,λ = (θ × 100 × Mr)/(n × c × l). Where θ is the recorded ellipticity (deg), Mr the molecular weight of the peptide, n the number of residues in the peptide, c the peptide concentration (mg/ml), and l the path length of the cuvette. Peptide Immunization and Antibody Purification—All animals were purchased from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN). Female ICR (outbred) and FVB/n (inbred) mice, 6–8 weeks old, were immunized with either disulfide-paired (MVF626–649SS) or unpaired (MVF626–649NC) chimeric peptides dissolved in H2O with 100 μg of a muramyl dipeptide adjuvant, nor-MDP (N-acetylglucosamine-3 yl-acetyl- l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine). Peptides were emulsified (50:50) in Montanide ISA 720 vehicle. The same dose of booster injections was administered twice at 3 and 6 weeks. Sera were collected by retro-orbital bleeding at 1 and 3 weeks after each immunization for determination of antibody titers. High-titered sera were purified on a protein A/G-agarose column (Pierce, Rockford, IL) and eluted antibodies were concentrated and exchanged in phosphate-buffered saline using 100-kDa cut-off centrifuge filter units (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentration of antibodies was determined by Coomassie plus protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). ELISA—Antibody titers were determined as previously described (12Dakappagari N.K. Douglas D.B. Triozzi P.L. Stevens V.C. Kaumaya P.T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3782-3789PubMed Google Scholar). Ab titers were defined as the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution with an absorbance of 0.2 or greater after subtracting the background. Mouse Isotyping—Mouse sera were isotyped using Mouse Typer Sub-Isotyping Kit (Bio-Rad). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that a 1/500 dilution of goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate was used. Cell Lines and Abs—All cell culture media, fetal calf serum (FCS), and supplements were purchased from Invitrogen. The human breast tumor cell lines, BT-474 (HER-2high; ∼2 × 106 molecules/cell) and MDA-468 (HER-2low; 10,000–50,000 molecules/cell) were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained according to the supplier's guidelines. HER-2 mAb Ab-2 (clone 9G6) was purchased from Neomarkers (Fremont, CA). Humanized mouse mAb Herceptin™ was generously provided by Genentech (San Francisco, CA). Flow Cytometry—5 × 105 BT-474 or MDA-468 cells were titrated with 2, 10, 20, and 50 μg of purified peptide vaccine-induced ICR mouse Abs to establish saturation. Normal mouse Ig (negative control) and HER-2-specific mouse monoclonal antibody Ab-2 (positive control) were used as controls. The cells were incubated in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 2% FCS for 1 h at 4 °C, washed once in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated with fluoroscein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody (1:50 dilution) for 30 min at 4 °C in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline, 1% FCS. Cells were washed, fixed in 1% formaldehyde, and analyzed by Coulter ELITE flow cytometer (Coulter, Hialeah, FL). A total of 10,000 cells were counted for each sample and final processing was performed. Debris, cell clusters, and dead cells were gated out by light scattered assessment before single parameter histograms were drawn and smoothened. Anchorage-independent Growth Assay—Into each of four 60-mm culture dishes, 1 × 103 BT-474 cells were suspended in 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 culture media containing 0.18% agarose. The culture media was supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mm l-glutamine and contained 1% penicillin-streptomycin. This suspension was overlaid onto a 6-ml feeder layer consisting of 0.24% agarose in conditioned Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 media (as described above). The cultures received purified peptide vaccine-induced ICR mouse Abs or Herceptin at 10 μg/ml, or were left untreated, and then were incubated at 37 °C. Cultures were fed weekly with 1 ml of conditioned media containing the same dose of antibody. After 21 days the cultures were stained by treating them with 1 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 1 mg/ml p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet. The next day colonies were counted under low field magnification. The colonies were counted in six random fields for each treatment and averaged to give the final colony count (±S.E.). IFN-γ Release Assay—96-Well plates were layered with 50,000 BT-474 or MDA-468 human breast cancer cells. After 24 h the tumor cells were coated with normal mouse IgG or purified peptide vaccine-induced ICR mouse Abs at 10 μg/ml and incubated for 2 h. Wells were washed of any unbound antibody and 2 × 105 purified human PBMCs (American Red Cross, Columbus, OH) were added to each well. After 3 days, cell-free supernatants were harvested and IFN-γ levels determined by a sandwich ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences). Results are reported in picograms/ml and represent the mean ± S.E. of duplicate samples. Antibody-dependent Cell-mediated Cytotoxicity Assay (ADCC)—PBMCs from normal human donors obtained by density gradient centrifugation in Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) were washed twice in RPMI 1640, 5% FCS and then serially diluted in 96-well plates to give effector to target ratios of 100:1, 20:1, and 4:1. Effector cells were incubated in the presence of interleukin-2 at a concentration of 15 ng/ml. The following day target cells received 2 μg/well of Protein A/G purified peptide vaccine-induced ICR mouse Abs or the humanized mouse monoclonal Herceptin. BT-474 and MDA-468 target cells (HER-2high and HER-2low, respectively) were labeled with 100 μCi/1 × 106 cells of Na51CrO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washings 5 × 103 target cells were delivered to each well to give a final volume of 0.2 ml/well. The cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, after which time 75 μl of cell-free supernatants were harvested and radioactivity determined using a γ-counter. To assess nonspecific lysis effector, target cells were co-incubated in the presence of normal mouse antibodies. Cytotoxicity was calculated by the formula: (%) lysis = (A-B)/(C-B) × 100, where A represents 51Cr (cpm) from test supernatants, B represents 51Cr (cpm) from target alone in culture (spontaneous release), and C represents maximum 51Cr release from target cells lysed with 5% Triton X-100. Results represent the average (±S.E.) of triplicate samples and have normal mouse Abs subtracted. Tumor Challenge and Evaluation of Tumor Development—The neu-expressing mouse mammary carcinoma cell line NT2.5, derived from a spontaneous mammary tumor that developed in an FVB/n rat neu transgenic mouse (FVB/n202), was used for tumor challenge. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium Nutrient Mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.01 mg/ml insulin. Groups of FVB/n mice (n = 7–10) were challenged with 5 × 106 NT2.5 cells subcutaneously (lower abdomen) 10 days after final immunization. Mice were monitored twice weekly for the presence of palpable tumors. Tumors were measured with calipers in a blinded fashion and tumor volume was calculated by the formula (long measurement × short measurement2)/2. Statistical Analysis—Tumor growth over time was analyzed using the Stata's® XTGEE (cross-sectional generalized estimating equations) model that fits general linear models that allow you to specify within animal correlation structure. This model is used to account for the correlation in the response variable when you have repeated measures over time on the same subject (mouse). This approach works well when the data are fairly balanced (a relatively small number of missing values) and are measured at a common set of times on many experimental units. The model includes terms for both treatment group and time. Treatment by time interaction is used to calculate the differences in the slopes of each group. This difference is tested to see if it is statistically significant. A test for the difference in the intercepts was not done because biologically these should all be zero at the beginning of the treatment program. The statistical model used in the XTGEE analysis is shown as: Y = βo + β1; treatment + β2; day + β3. (treatment · day) + ϵ0, where Y = log transformed tumor volumes, βi values = regression coefficients; ϵ0 = error term, which is normally distributed with mean equal to zero and variance σ2. The model assumes that the data are normally distributed and that volume is a continuous linear variable. Log transformation of the volume addresses both of these issues. The slopes by treatment of the log transformed tumor volumes were calculated and compared to determine whether there was a statistically significant difference between treatments. A rough Bonferroni correction is used to keep the overall significance level at 5%. However, Bonferroni's method gives results that are too conservative for this many multiple comparisons and thus an α = 0.01 was used to determine whether individual differences are statistically significant (i.e. p value ≤ α) between control groups compared with vaccine-treated groups of animals. The results of the above regression are transformed back into their original units. The exponential slope is used to calculate doubling time along with their 95% confidence intervals. Doubling time is the number of days required for the size of the tumor to double. The general form of the exponential equation used to calculate doubling time is shown as, volume (mm3) = Vo exp(m·days), where Vo = initial volume and m = exponential"
https://openalex.org/W2037106616,"High mobility group box (HMGB) proteins are architectural proteins whose HMG DNA binding domains confer significant preference for distorted DNA, such as 4-way junctions. HMO1 is one of 10 Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMGB proteins, and it is required for normal growth and plasmid maintenance and for regulating the susceptibility of yeast chromatin to nuclease. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have shown here that HMO1 binds 26-bp duplex DNA with Kd = 39.6 ± 5.0 nm and that its divergent box A domain participates in DNA interactions, albeit with low affinity. HMO1 has only modest preference for DNA with altered conformations, including DNA with nicks, gaps, overhangs, or loops, as well as for 4-way junction structures and supercoiled DNA. HMO1 binds 4-way junctions with half-maximal saturation of 19.6 ± 2.2 nm, with only a modest increase in affinity in the absence of magnesium ions (half-maximal saturation 6.1 ± 1.1 nm). Whereas the box A domain contributes modest structure-specific binding, the box B domain is required for high affinity binding. HMO1 bends DNA, as measured by DNA cyclization assays, facilitating cyclization of 136-, 105-, and 87-bp DNA, but not 75-bp DNA, and it has a significantly longer residence time on DNA minicircles compared with linear duplex DNA.

They are abundant proteins that are grouped, in part based on their DNA binding characteristics, into three major classes, HMGA, HMGB, and HMGN (1Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

The HMG DNA binding domain, which interacts with ∼10 bp of duplex, binds to the minor groove of DNA by partial intercalation of one or two surface-exposed, conserved hydrophobic residues into the base pair stack. Consequently, the DNA is greatly distorted, resulting in a sharp bend and helical underwinding (4Wong B. Masse E.J. Yen Y. Giannikoupolous P. Feigon J. Johnson C.R.

HMGB1 contains tandem HMG box domains referred to as box A and box B; DNA-intercalating residues are located at positions 16 and 37 of helices I and II, respectively, and both can contribute to binding affinity (11He Q.

HMGB proteins have been implicated in diverse biological processes such as transcription, recombination, replication, and DNA repair by virtue of their ability to facilitate assembly of nucleoprotein complexes (1Bustin M.

HMO1 and HMO2 are ∼25-kDa HMG box proteins, also identified by homology-based motif prediction programs as having only a single HMG box, in a position corresponding to box B of mammalian HMGB. However, HMO1 also contains an N-terminal box A domain with weak similarity to consensus HMG box domains (Fig. 1). The relative abundance of NHP6A/B and HMO1/2 was recently determined as part of a global analysis of protein expression in yeast. All four proteins are moderately abundant, with an estimated 1.9 × 104 molecules of HMO1/cell compared with ∼4 × 103 for NHP6A/B and 1.8 × 103 for HMO2 (29Ghaemmaghami S. Huh W.K. Bower K. Howson R.W. Belle A. Dephoure N. O'Shea E.K. Weissman J.S. Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). Strains bearing HMO1 or HMO2 mutant alleles are viable, although HMO1 mutant strains have growth defects, compromised plasmid maintenance, and nuclease-sensitive chromatin, suggesting that HMO1 may play a role in stability of the chromatin structure (30Lu J. Kobayashi R. Brill S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33678-33685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HMO1 has been shown to interact genetically and physically with FKBP12 prolyl isomerase, a ubiquitous, highly conserved, abundant enzyme that catalyzes a rate-limiting step in protein folding. Dolinski and Heitman (31Dolinski J.K. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 151: 935-944Google Scholar) found that mutations in HMO1 and in the FPR1 gene that encodes FKBP12 are synthetically lethal. A recent study implicates HMO1 as part of the rRNA transcription apparatus, where it was proposed to function in a similar capacity as the upstream binding factor, which is an auxiliary factor in the mammalian and amphibian RNA Polymerase I transcription systems. The upstream binding factor has six HMG domains (32Gadal O. Labarre S. Boschiero C. Thuriaux P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5498-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). HMO1 has also recently been shown to participate in mutagenesis control, but its exact role remains to be elucidated (33Alekseev Y.S. Kovaltsova V.S. Fedorova V.I. Gracheva M.L. Evstukhina A.T. Peshekhonov T.V. Korolev G.V. DNA Repair. 2002; 1: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have shown here that the divergent box A domain does participate in direct DNA contacts and that it contributes modest structure-specific DNA binding to HMO1, whereas box B confers most of the DNA binding affinity. HMO1 displays a longer residence time on constrained DNA minicircles, consistent with its role in the maintenance of chromatin structure. Cloning and Purification of Proteins—The gene encoding HMO1 was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using primers modified to introduce NdeI sites at both ends of the PCR product, forward primer, 5′-GCCTGTCACCATATGACTACAG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-AGTAACGCATATGTCCGTCC-3′ (NdeI sites underlined). The HMO1 gene was cloned into the NdeI site of plasmid pET5a, and plasmid carrying the HMO1 gene was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. HMO1 expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at an A600 of 0.4 and the culture incubated for 3 h. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)). Cells were disrupted by sonication and nucleic acids digested by addition of DNase I followed by a 1-h incubation on ice. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was dialyzed overnight against HA buffer, pH 8.7 (20 mm Tris-HCL, 50 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF). The dialysate was passed through tandem columns of DEAE-cellulose and CM-Sepharose equilibrated with the same buffer. Proteins were eluted with a 120-ml linear gradient from 50 mm KCl (HA buffer) to 1 m KCl (HB buffer: 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 4 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm PMSF). Peak fractions were collected, dialyzed overnight in HA buffer, pH 8.7, and passed through a Heparin column equilibrated with the same buffer; proteins were eluted and analyzed as described above. Peak fractions were collected and dialyzed overnight in HA buffer, pH 7.0. The dialysate was passed through CM-Sepharose equilibrated with the same buffer, and proteins were eluted and analyzed as described above. Pure HMO1 fractions were concentrated and quantitated on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. The gene encoding HMO1 was also subcloned into pET28b for expression with an N-terminal His6 tag. Using a PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis approach, a stop codon was inserted into the HMO1 gene in place of Pro-91 to create the truncated protein HMO1-BoxA, lacking box B and the basic tail region, using primers forward, 5′-CGCTGCTTGAGTCAAGGCT-3′, and reverse, 5′-ATAATAGCATCTTTATCATCATCAATAGGG-3′. Plasmids HMO1-pET28b and BoxA-pET28b were transformed into E. coli Rosetta Blue. Cultures were grown to an A600 of 0.2, and expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in a dialysis/lysis buffer, pH 7 (50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF), and disrupted by sonication. Nucleic acids were digested by addition of DNase I followed by a 1-h incubation on ice. The lysate was dialyzed overnight in dialysis/lysis buffer. The dialysate was passed through a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column equilibrated with dialysis/lysis buffer and washed with 5 column volumes of wash buffer, pH 7 (50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF). Proteins were eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient from 20 mm imidazole (wash buffer) to 250 mm imidazole (elution buffer, 50 mm NaxHyPO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm PMSF) followed by 100 ml of elution buffer. Pure HMO1 and HMO1-BoxA fractions were quantitated on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gels using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Bacillus subtilis HU was cloned from B. subtilis genomic DNA and overexpressed in E. coli. Detailed procedures for its cloning and purification will be reported elsewhere. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectra were recorded on an AVIV Model 202 CD spectrophotometer using a 1-cm path length sample cell. Wavelength scans from 200 to 240 nm were performed in triplicate, and data points were averaged and smoothed using standard methods. The wavelength scan for His6-tagged HMO1 was recorded at 25 °C with a protein concentration of 0.025 mg/ml in 2.5 mm NaxHyPO4, pH 7.0, 0.5% glycerol, 10 mm NaCl. The wavelength scan for His6-tagged HMO1-BoxA was recorded at 4 °C using a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 1 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.03% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 2.8 mm KCl. Ligase-mediated Circularization—Ligation substrates were prepared by digestion of PCR-amplified or plasmid DNA with appropriate endonucleases. pET5a was digested with BamHI and BgIII to generate a 136-bp fragment, whereas BspHI digestion generated a 105-bp fragment. An 87-bp fragment was generated by digestion of pcDNA3 with SacI. A 75-bp DNA fragment was generated by PCR amplification of the 390–538-bp region of pUC18 using Taq polymerase and primers 5′-GCCAGTGCCAAGCTTGCATG-3′ and 5′-CTTTATGCTCTCGAGTCGTATGTT-3′, followed by digestion with SacI. DNA fragments were purified on 7% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were initiated by addition of 20 units of T4 DNA ligase to a final volume of 100 μl of reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% BRIJ58) containing 1200 fmol DNA, with or without HMO1. Time points were taken over 90 min. For each time point, 8 μl of the reaction mixture was quenched by addition of 5 μl of stop buffer (75 mm EDTA, 15% glycerol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 6 μg/μl proteinase K). Samples were heated at 55 °C for 15 min and resolved on prerun 7% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels (39:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 4 °C with 0.5× TBE (50 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA). Quantitation was performed on an Amersham Biosciences Storm Phosphorimager using software supplied by the manufacturer. DNA Supercoiling—Reactions contained 0.2 μg of relaxed closed circular pUC18 plasmid, prepared by adding 2.5 units of Vaccinia topoisomerase I (Epicentre) to supercoiled pUC18 in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm EDTA. After 1.5 h at 37 °C, varying amounts of HMO1 were added and the reactions incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Reactions were quenched with 5 μl of termination buffer (5× TBE, 5% SDS, 15% sucrose, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 2 μg/μl proteinase K) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were loaded on 1% 1× TBE-agarose gels and electrophoresed at 2 V/cm for 12 h in 1× TBE buffer. Agarose Gel Retardation—Reactions were incubated at room temperature in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 0.2 μg of linear, relaxed closed circular or supercoiled pUC18 and varying amounts of HMO1 or HMO1-BoxA. Complexes were resolved on 0.7% 1× TAE-agarose gels and electrophoresed at 2.5 V/cm for 3 h in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were stained with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) with DNA Minicircles—The 105-bp fragment generated by BspHI digestion of pET5a DNA was 5′-end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. DNA minicircles were generated by intramolecular ligation of the 32P-labeled 105-bp DNA fragment with 20 units of T4 DNA ligase in the presence of Thermotoga maritima HU for 2 h at room temperature (34Grove A. Lim L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 491-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Samples were treated with Exonuclease III for 1 h at room temperature and the reactions quenched with stop buffer. The deproteinised DNA was purified on a 6% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gel (39:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide). EMSA was performed with linear and circular 105-bp DNA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 5 fmol DNA and varying amounts of HMO1. Where indicated, reactions were performed in the absence of MgCl2. Samples were resolved on prerun 7% (w/v) native polyacrylamide gels (39:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 4 °C with 0.5× TBE running buffer. Complexes were visualized by phosphorimaging. In DNA competition assays, 10 fmol of 32P-labeled linear or circular 105-bp DNA was incubated with HMO1 for 30 min at room temperature to allow complex formation, followed by addition of varying amounts of linear pUC18 plasmid DNA. Samples were resolved as described above. For calculating fractional complex formation, the region on the gel from the slowest migrating complex to the free DNA was considered as complex. EMSA with 4-Way DNA Junctions—4-Way junctions were constructed using a published protocol (35Stros M. Muselikova E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35699-35707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); the sequence of individual strands was as described (36Ghosh S. Grove A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 4-way junction was prepared by annealing the four strands, followed by purification of the junctions on native polyacrylamide gels. To ensure that all oligonucleotides were present, aliquots of the purified junctions were run on denaturing gels. EMSA were performed as described above with 5 fmol DNA and varying amounts of HMO1 or HMO1-BoxA; for experiments with HMO1-BoxA, the reaction buffer was modified to contain only 25 mm NaCl, MgCl2 was omitted, and 0.5% Tween 20 was included. In competition assays, 20- or 1000-fold mass excess of unlabeled linear pUC18 DNA was added after the addition of HMO1. Complexes were resolved and quantified as described above. EMSA with Linear Duplex DNA and DNA Containing Loops, Nicks, Gaps, or Overhangs—Oligonucleotides were purchased and purified by denaturing gel electrophoresis. Oligonucleotides used to generate constructs with loops, nicks, gaps, or overhangs included a common 37-nt top strand, 5′-CCTAGGCTACACCTACTCTTTGTAAGAATTAAGCTTC-3′. To generate 37-bp duplex DNA, complementary oligonucleotides were mixed at equimolar concentrations, heated at 90 °C, and slowly cooled to room temperature. To generate looped DNA, a complementary strand with a pair of 2-nt mismatches with 11-nt spacing (3′-GGATCCGATGCCATGAGAAACATAGTTAATTCGAAG-5′, with mismatched nucleotides underlined) was annealed to the top strand. A spacing of 11 bp was chosen as it represents the spacing that yielded optimal complex formation with mammalian HMGB1 (37Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The 37-bp DNA with a central nick, gap, or a 3′-overhang was prepared as described (36Ghosh S. Grove A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The 18-bp duplex corresponded to the sequence of the 5′ half of the 37-bp duplex. The sequence of the 26-bp duplex was 5′-CGTGACTACTGTAAGTCGATGATCCG-3′. EMSA were performed as described above with 5 fmol DNA. The observed fraction of complex formation was corrected for dissociation during electrophoresis, and binding isotherms for HMO1 binding to 26-bp DNA were fitted as described (36Ghosh S. Grove A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 561-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All experiments were done at least in triplicate, and values are reported as the mean ± S.D. Competition assays involving HMO1-BoxA were performed with 32P-labeled 26-bp DNA. Reactions were incubated at room temperature in 10 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 fmol DNA, 400 fmol B. subtilis HU, or 4 pmol full-length HMO1, and varying amounts of HMO1-BoxA. B. subtilis HU or HMO1 was incubated with DNA at room temperature for 5 min, followed by addition of HMO1-BoxA. Samples were resolved on prerun 7% native gels at 4 °C with 0.5× TBE running buffer. Complexes were visualized by phosphorimaging. DNA Binding by HMO1 and HMO1-BoxA—Recombinant HMO1 and His6-HMO1 were purified to apparent homogeneity as judged by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. For analysis of DNA binding by the divergent box A domain, N-terminal His6-tagged HMO1-BoxA was also prepared (Fig. 2A). CD spectra of both full-length HMO1 and HMO1-BoxA are characterized by negative ellipticities at 208 and 222 nm, indicative of significant α-helical content (Fig. 2, B and C). The qualitatively comparable spectra suggest that HMO1-BoxA is an independently folded domain. The previously reported ability of HMO1 to self-associate (31Dolinski J.K. Heitman J. Genetics. 1998; 151: 935-944Google Scholar), evident at higher protein concentrations, was also characteristic of the box A domain for which well resolved CD spectra required the presence of detergent. DNA binding was analyzed with EMSA. Although no stable complex could be seen on incubation of 18-bp DNA with full-length HMO1 (data not shown), a single complex formed with 26-bp DNA (Fig. 3). No difference was seen between N-terminal His6-tagged and untagged HMO1 (data not shown; all subsequent experiments were performed with untagged HMO1). The apparent dissociation constant Kd for HMO1 binding to 26-bp DNA is 39.5 ± 5.0 nm. HMO1 forms two complexes with 37-bp DNA (Fig. 4A), as seen previously with the mammalian two-HMG box protein HMGB1 (37Grove A. Galeone A. Mayol L. Geiduschek E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 120-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), suggesting similar site sizes. Half-maximal saturation is observed at 33.1 ± 3.9 nm HMO1. For reactions performed in the absence of Mg2+, the affinity is slightly higher with half-maximal saturation of 15.6 ± 2.3 nm (data not shown). The lower affinity measured in the presence of magnesium ions may not be due to effects caused specifically by the divalent ions but a general effect of raised ionic strength.Fig. 4Binding of HMO1 and B. subtilis HU to 4-way junctions and linear duplex DNA. A, HMO1. B, B. subtilis HU. Reactions contain 5 fmol DNA, and protein concentrations are 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 60 nm (identical for all panels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although no complex is detected upon incubation of 26-bp DNA with HMO1-BoxA, a competition experiment in which full-length HMO1 is incubated with 26-bp DNA in the presence of increasing concentrations of HMO1-BoxA shows a reduction in HMO1·DNA complex formation, suggesting that HMO1-BoxA competes for binding to the DNA (data not shown). However, because HMO1-BoxA self-associates, this experiment does not exclude the possibility that HMO1·DNA complex formation is impaired because of interactions between HMO1-BoxA and full-length protein. The competition experiment was therefore also performed using the unrelated architectural protein HU from B. subtilis (Fig. 5A). Consistent with DNA binding by HMO1-BoxA, HU·DNA complex formation is also reduced in the presence of HMO1-BoxA. Efficient competition requires micromolar concentration of HMO1-BoxA, suggesting low affinity binding, consistent with HMO1-BoxA complexes with 26-bp DNA being too unstable to detect following electrophoresis. HMO1 and HMO1-BoxA Have Only Limited Preference for Distorted DNA—HMGB proteins have been shown to recognize distorted DNA structures selectively (21Webb M. Payet D. Lee K. Travers A.A. Thomas J.O.

https://openalex.org/W2054041272,"Nitric oxide (NO) remains the only firmly established endogenous modulator of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, but physiological, structural, and biochemical evidence now suggests that in vivo regulation of sGC involves direct interaction with other factors. We searched for such endogenous modulators in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and COS-7 cells. The cytosolic fraction of both cell types stimulated the activity of semipurified sGC severalfold in the absence or presence of a saturating concentration of NO. The cytosolic factor was sensitive to proteinase K and destroyed by boiling, suggesting that it contains a protein component. Size exclusion chromatography revealed peaks of activity between 40 and 70 kDa. The sGC-activating effect was further purified by ion exchange chromatography. In the presence of the benzylindazole YC-1 or NO, the partially purified factor synergistically activated sGC, suggesting that this factor had a mode of activation different from that of YC-1 or NO. Four candidate activators were identified from the final purification step by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Using an sGC affinity matrix, one of them, the molecular chaperone Hsp70, was shown to directly interact with sGC. This interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in lung tissues and by co-localization in smooth muscle cells. sGC and Hsp70 co-localized at the plasma membrane, supporting the idea that sGC can be translocated to the membrane. Hsp70 co-purifies with the sGC-activating effect, and immunodepletion of Hsp70 from COS-7 cytosol coincided with a marked attenuation of the sGC-activating effect, yet the effect was not rescued by the addition of pure Hsp70. Thus, Hsp70 is a novel sGC-interacting protein that is responsible for the sGC-activating effect, probably in association with other factors or after covalent modification.

In the presence of the benzylindazole YC-1 or NO, the partially purified factor synergistically activated sGC, suggesting that this factor had a mode of activation different from that of YC-1 or NO. Four candidate activators were identified from the final purification step by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry analysis. Using an sGC affinity matrix, one of them, the molecular chaperone Hsp70, was shown to directly interact with sGC. This interaction was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in lung tissues and by co-localization in smooth muscle cells. sGC and Hsp70 co-localized at the plasma membrane, supporting the idea that sGC can be translocated to the membrane. Hsp70 co-purifies with the sGC-activating effect, and immunodepletion of Hsp70 from COS-7 cytosol coincided with a marked attenuation of the sGC-activating effect, yet the effect was not rescued by the addition of pure Hsp70. Thus, Hsp70 is a novel sGC-interacting protein that is responsible for the sGC-activating effect, probably in association with other factors or after covalent modification. The cellular processes that are regulated by NO are central to many aspects of biology and disease, particularly in the cardiovascular and central nervous system. Despite the widely recognized importance of NO, little is known about the mechanism of regulation of the NO receptor, the soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) 1The abbreviations used are: sGC, soluble guanylyl cyclase; SNAP, S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine; cPTIO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide; DTT, dithiothreitol; HUVEC, human umbilical vein cells; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol; IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine; FPLC, fast protein liquid chromatography; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time of flight; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MS, mass spectrometry; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; RIA, radioimmunoassay.

A. 1999; 96: 14753-14758Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). sGC is a heterodimeric enzyme formed by an α and a β subunit, the latter containing the heme where NO binds. Upon binding of NO, activity of sGC increases several hundred-fold over basal levels to produce the second messenger cGMP from the substrate GTP (4Denninger J.W. Marletta M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 334-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar, 5Koesling D. Methods. 1999; 19: 485-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Conflicting data have emerged from the studies of mechanisms of regulation of sGC in vivo and in vitro. In vitro, the rate of dissociation of NO from the heme occurs in minutes, perhaps seconds (6Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), whereas in cerebellar cells, dissociation is 25-fold faster (7Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4287-4292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 8Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2002; 230: 165-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similarly, desensitization of sGC has been characterized in vivo but has not been observed with the purified form of the enzyme (9Sharma V.S. Magde D. Methods. 1999; 19: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). These discrepancies between in vivo and in vitro data suggest the involvement of endogenous modulators of sGC. Several years ago, an allosteric inhibitor of sGC was isolated from bovine lung, but its identity has yet to be determined (10Kim T.D. Burstyn J.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15540-15545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Significant progress in understanding the regulation of sGC was achieved with the discovery of YC-1, a benzylindazole first identified by its capacity to increase the production of cGMP in intact platelets (11Ko F.N. Wu C.C. Kuo S.C. Lee F.Y. Teng C.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 4226-4233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YC-1 synergistically activates sGC in the presence of NO, apparently by slowing down the dissociation rate of NO from the heme and by increasing the efficacy of NO stimulation (6Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). YC-1 can also stimulate the sGC activity independently of NO (13Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Furthermore, YC-1 has the ability to potentiate stimulation of sGC by carbon monoxide (CO) (13Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 14Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10699-10706Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). CO by itself activates sGC poorly, but in the presence of YC-1, it stimulates sGC as much as NO. These observations raise the possibility that endogenous analogs of YC-1 could enhance responsiveness to NO, activate sGC independently of NO, or potentiate CO activation, providing a cGMP-signaling pathway distinct from that mediated by NO. Recently, studies reported the existence in endothelial cells of a heat-labile activator of sGC (15Schmidt K. Schrammel A. Koesling D. Mayer B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 220-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, its cGMP-promoting effect was dependent on YC-1. We describe herein a search for endogenous modulators that led to the identification of an interaction between sGC and the molecular chaperone Hsp70. Human umbilical vein cells (HUVEC) were grown in endothelial cell basal medium prepared with the EGM Bulletkit (Clonetics). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (ICN) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin (Mediatech). Human umbilical vein (HUVEC/CC-2519) cells were from BioWhittaker, and COS-7 cells (CRL-1651) and rat smooth muscle cells (CRL-2018) were purchased from ATCC. Sf21 cells (IPLB-Sf21 Clontech) were cultured in Sf900-II SFM medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) at 27 °C. Cells were grown in 100-mm dishes until 90-100% confluence. HUVEC cells were used at passages 2-10. Cells were carefully washed four times with 8 ml of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, with 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) before being scraped from plates and sonicated in the same buffer. The cytosolic fraction was separated from membranes by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was estimated by Bradford assay (Sigma) using bovine serum albumin as standard (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cytosols of HUVEC and COS-7 cells were diluted to 0.3 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. Viruses containing the rat α1 subunit and β1 subunit, the latter carrying six histidines at its carboxyl terminus, were generated. The α1/β1-Histag sGC was expressed in a Sf21/baculovirus system and purified using Talon cobalt resin (Clontech) followed by MonoQ 5/5 FPLC (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (12Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Fractions with the highest sGC activity were pooled in 10% glycerol and 5 mm DTT and snap frozen. GC activity was determined by formation of [α-32P]cGMP from [α-32P]GTP, as previously described (12Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Reactions were performed for 10 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl, in a 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, reaction buffer containing 500 μm GTP, 1 mm DTT, and 5 mm MgCl2. For initial characterization, the NO donor Glyco-SNAP-2 at 100 μm (Calbiochem) was used to stimulate the sGC activity. To determine the mechanisms of activation of the partially purified factor, the NO donor SNAP (Calbiochem) was used at a lower concentration (1 μm). Typically, 5 μl of purified sGC (10 ng/μl) was used in each assay reaction. No variation in the pH of the reaction (pH 8.0) was observed after the addition of the extract and completion of the enzymatic assay. To avoid potential substrate depletion, a regenerating system was used by the addition to the reaction mixture of 5 mm creatine phosphate and 15 milliunits of creatine phosphokinase (Sigma). cGMP production was also measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) as previously described (12Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 17Domino S.E. Tubb D.J. Garbers D.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). All samples were assayed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated at least three times. Cytosolic extracts (1 mg/ml) were incubated with 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Invitrogen) at 50 °C for 30 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). We determined that phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride does not interfere with sGC activity (data not shown). To determine whether the sGC-activating effect was independent of NO, 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO; Calbiochem) was used as NO scavenger at 450 μm. We verified that cPTIO was effective in scavenging NO, since the addition of cPTIO lowered GC activity stimulated with 1 μm SNAP to its basal level. For NO concentration-response curves of semipurified sGC, activity was measured in the presence of nine different concentrations of the NO donor SNAP (from 0.03 to 300 μm). The NO concentration-response curve was similarly established in the presence of 10 μg of COS-7 cytosol. All concentration-response experiments were performed in duplicate, and each experiment was repeated three times. The EC50 values were calculated from these concentration-response curves and corresponded to the concentration of SNAP that half-maximally activates the enzyme. To investigate the effect of calcium, 5 mm EGTA was added to reaction buffer containing 9 mm MgCl2. Free calcium concentrations were calculated using Maxchelator software. To determine whether depletion of cGMP was a factor, 1-300 μm cGMP was added to the reaction mixture. 250 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; ACROS) was used as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. For gel filtration chromatography, Sephacryl S-100 HR 16/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Proteins were eluted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, buffer containing 150 mm NaCl using FPLC at 0.75 ml/min. Bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), and myoglobin (17.5 kDa) from Sigma were used as standards. DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Amersham Biosciences) was swelled and washed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. 2 ml of swelled DEAE-Sephadex were mixed with an equal volume of dialyzed COS-7 cytosol. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, DEAE-Sephadex-cytosol mix was transferred to a Poly-Prep chromatography column (Bio-Rad), and liquid was passed through. Eluted fractions containing cGMP-promoting activity were pooled and applied to a Mono Q HR 5/5 column at 1 ml/min. Buffer A contained 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0. Buffer B was prepared by adding 1.5 m NaCl to buffer A. Proteins were eluted with an increasing salt gradient. The fractions containing the cGMP promoting effect were desalted with 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, using PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), pooled, and kept at -80 °C. The purity was estimated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). To estimate the effect of YC-1 in the presence of the semipurified factor, 10 μm YC-1 was added to the reaction buffer, in the absence or presence of 1 μm SNAP. YC-1 was dissolved in Me2SO. Me2SO final concentration was less than 0.1% in the reaction mix. Stimulation with CO was conducted as follows: reaction buffer minus [α-32P]GTP was bubbled with CO gas (BOC Gases) for 3 min. The CO-saturated buffer was then diluted with non-CO-treated reaction buffer containing [α-32P]GTP, and the reaction started immediately. MonoQ contents were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by zinc staining (GelCode E-Zink Reversible Stain Kit; Pierce). Individual protein bands were excised and digested with trypsin, and peptides were extracted for MALDI-TOF analysis using a Voyager-DE™ PRO MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The data base search for peptide mass fingerprint was done with Profound data base. All procedures were carried out by the Mass Spectrometry/Proteomics Core Facility at New Jersey Medical School. Affinity Binding—1 μg of purified sGC-Histag and 400 μg of desalted COS-7 cytosol were mixed for 1 h at 4 °C. 100 μl of Talon resin equilibrated in 50 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 35 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and 0.015% β-ME were added to samples and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C. Resin was collected in Handee™ Spin Cup Columns (Pierce) by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 1 min and washed twice with 1 ml of wash buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, protease inhibitors, and 0.015% β-ME and once with the same buffer containing 50 mm NaCl. The resin bound complex was eluted with 100 μl of 150 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl. Eluted proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Hsp70 (mouse monoclonal; Abcam), anti-β1 subunit of sGC (rabbit polyclonal; kindly provided by Dr. David L. Garbers), anti-protein-disulfide isomerase (mouse monoclonal; Abcam), and anti-β/γ actin (rabbit polyclonal; Abcam). To measure the activity of the eluted samples, the same protocol was used, but the resin-bound complex was eluted with 50 mm EDTA in a 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, buffer containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.015% β-ME. For these affinity experiments, the sGC-purified preparation did not contain DTT or glycerol. To study the direct interaction between pure Hsp70 (Stressgen) and sGC, the above protocol was modified as follows: 1 μg of purified sGC-Histag was passed through 200 μl of Talon cobalt resin equilibrated with 2 ml of PBS. The column was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 50 mm NaCl prior to applying 2 μg of pure Hsp70. The column was washed twice with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, buffer containing 500 mm and 150 mm NaCl. Proteins were eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 50 mm NaCl and 50 mm EDTA. Co-immunoprecipitation—Rat lungs were minced and then disrupted by Dounce homogenizer in 10 ml of cold lysis buffer: PBS buffer containing protease inhibitors, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min and then at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein concentration of lung lysates was between 10 and 12 mg/ml. If not used fresh, rat lung lysates were snap frozen and stored at -80 °C. Lung lysates (2 mg) were precleared with Protein A-Sepharose 4B beads, following the supplier's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Precleared lung lysates were incubated with nonimmune serum or mouse monoclonal anti-Hsp70 (1 μg/ml lung extract) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A beads were added to samples for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 s and washed in three alternating cycles of lysis buffer containing 1 m NaCl and no NaCl. Proteins were eluted in 1% SDS, 100 mm DTT and incubated at 95 °C for 3 min. Samples were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-β1 subunit of sGC. Immunodepletion—Typically, 100 μg of desalted COS-7 cytosol was precleared with Protein A-Sepharose and IgG (1:100 dilution) prior to incubation with 4 μl of anti-Hsp70 (serial dilutions 1:5 to 1:100) or with nonimmune serum (0.2 μg/ml of cytosol) overnight at 4 °C. Complexes were immunoprecipitated with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose 4B, as above. Supernatants were tested for their effects on sGC activity. To assess the efficiency of immunodepletion, supernatants were resolved on SDS 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-Hsp70. Effect of Purified Hsp70 on sGC Activity—50 ng of sGC and various concentrations (10, 50, or 100 ng) of purified Hsp70 (Stressgen) were incubated at room temperature for 5 min. sGC activity was then measured in basal and NO-stimulated conditions and in the absence or presence of 100 μm ATP, since some functions of Hsp70 involve ATPase activity (18Young J.C. Barral J.M. Ulrich Hartl F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 541-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry and Confocal Microscopy—Smooth muscle cells (CRL-2018; ATCC) were plated on round 18CIR coverslips in 12-well tissue culture plates. The coverslips were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed three times in 1-2 ml of PBS for 5 min, and then permeabilized with 100% acetone for 10 min at -20 °C. The cells were washed three times in PBS and incubated in a humidified container for 30 min at room temperature in blocking solution (PBS containing 2% normal goat serum and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA)) to prevent nonspecific binding of the primary antibodies. The coverslips were washed twice more in buffer (PBS containing 0.2% normal goat serum and 0.1% BSA). The primary antibodies against the β1 subunit of sGC (1:50 dilution) and Hsp70 (1:100 dilution) were diluted in the buffer and applied to the coverslips for a 2-h incubation at room temperature in a humidified container. Negative controls either lacked the primary antibodies (for anti-Hsp70), or a blocking peptide was applied (the C-terminal 15 amino acids for anti-β1 subunit). After incubation, the cells were washed three times in buffer and placed in blocking solution for another 30 min at room temperature and then washed in buffer twice. A solution containing the fluorescent secondary antibodies (Alexa green 488 (1:350 dilution) for sGC and Alexa Red 594 (1:35 dilution) for Hsp70) diluted in PBS was applied to the coverslips and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The cells were washed five times and stored in buffer overnight at 4 °C. The following day, the cells were washed three times in PBS and finally in 5 mm phosphate buffer. The coverslips were then mounted onto labeled microscope slides using anti-fade mounting medium and then sealed. Slides were stored in opaque slide boxes at 4 °C when not in use. Confocal images were taken with a Nikon PCM 2000 microscope and Simple PCI software. A ×60 objective was used along with ×1 and ×3 zoom from the software to obtain pictures. Fluorescence was standardized across conditions with the following photomultiplier gain: green = 1702 and red = 2200 for both ×1 and ×3 pictures. Sections were imaged every 0.5 μm. Green and red images were merged with Adobe Photoshop version 6.0. 2M. Condrescu, personal communication. Data Analysis—The data derived from cGMP RIA or [32P]GTP assay were all expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons between two groups were made with Student's t test using GraphPad Prism software (p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant). An F-test that compares the NO concentration-response curves in the absence or presence of the cytosolic extract was combined with a paired t test to determine the significance of difference between the EC50 obtained with or without 10 μg of the cytosolic extract. The effect of the cytosolic extract on maximal NO-stimulated activity was calculated from the plateau of the concentration-response curves. A paired t test was used to determine whether the difference of the maximal NO-stimulated activity in the absence or presence of 10 μg of cytosol was statistically significant. The data points of the NO concentration-response curves that constituted a plateau (typically at 30, 100, and 300 μm SNAP) were grouped for statistical analysis and tested against the same group of data points obtained in the presence of cytosol. Search for a Cellular Modulator of sGC Activity—We started our search for an endogenous modulator of sGC activity in cytosolic fractions of HUVEC. These cells express components linked to the NO-cGMP pathway. Cytosolic fractions from COS-7 cells were initially used as a negative control because they do not express detectable levels of nitric-oxide synthase or sGC. Cytosolic fractions of HUVEC and COS-7 cells were tested for their effect on the activity of semipurified sGC in basal and stimulated conditions. For stimulated conditions, the NO donor GlycoSNAP-2 was used at 100 μm to maximally activate the sGC (a plateau is reached at 10-30 μm with this NO donor) (12Lamothe M. Chang F.J. Balashova N. Shirokov R. Beuve A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 3039-3048Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A strong stimulatory effect of HUVEC cytosolic fractions was observed on the basal and NO-stimulated activity of sGC as shown in Fig. 1A. 6 μg of HUVEC cytosol induced a 9-fold increase in basal activity of sGC. At saturating concentrations of GlycoSNAP-2 (100 μm), cytosolic fractions still caused more than a 2.5-fold increase in NO-stimulated sGC activity. That HUVEC cytosols were able to further increase maximally stimulated sGC activity constituted preliminary evidence that this activating factor may have a different mode of action than that of NO. The endogenous GC activity of the HUVEC cytosol was not significantly higher than the background of the [α-32P]cyclase assay and remained unchanged in the presence of GlycoSNAP-2 (Fig. 1A), indicating that endogenous sGC of HUVEC was not responsible for the observed severalfold increase in purified sGC activity. Surprisingly, an equivalent enhancement of sGC activity was triggered by cytosolic extracts isolated from COS-7 cells, initially used as a negative control (Fig. 1B). Basal sGC activity was increased 8-fold in the presence of 20 μg COS-7 cytosol. When the enzyme was maximally stimulated with GlycoSNAP-2, cGMP production by sGC was increased more than 2-fold by the addition of cytosol (Fig. 1B). COS-7 cells had no detectable endogenous GC activity under our assay conditions. Stimulating effect of the cytosol on sGC activity was retained after centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h and was absent from the membrane fraction, suggesting that the sGC activator is not tightly associated with membranes. Several components in the complete medium used for cell cultures may have the potential to increase enzymatic activity. Thus, we measured the sGC activity in the presence of serial dilutions of the cell culture complete medium. No significant change in activity was observed (data not shown). To further characterize this activating effect, we used cytosolic fractions of COS-7 cells, because they are easier to grow than HUVEC and do not express detectable levels of sGC or nitric-oxide synthase that could interfere with our assay, yet they seem to contain a strong sGC-activating component. The sGC-activating Effect Is Dependent on Concentration of the Extract—Increasing concentrations of cytosol were added to the sGC reaction buffer, and activity of the purified sGC was measured in basal conditions and in the presence of submaximal concentration (1 μm) of the NO donor, SNAP (Fig. 2). In both basal and NO-stimulated conditions, increasing concentrations of COS-7 cytosol promoted increasing production of cGMP. In contrast to the initial screening, cytosols at the highest concentration induced a slightly larger increase in NO-stimulated GC activity than in basal GC activity, probably because the NO donor is used at submaximal concentration (1 μm versus 100 μm in the initial experiment). A previous study showed that BSA at 0.19 mg/ml induced an ∼30% increase in sGC activity, probably by stabilization of the enzyme over the time of reaction (19Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 240-243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we repeated the same experiments in the presence of serial dilutions of BSA that roughly corresponded to the concentration of COS-7 cytosol used. We measured a slight increase of sGC activity (1.4-fold) that was essentially unchanged over a range of 0.0025- 0.5 mg of BSA/ml and similar in basal and NO-stimulated conditions (Fig. 2). Protease and Temperature Sensitivity—The cellular extract was subjected to digestion by proteinase K at 50 °C, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We measured the sGC-activating effect of digested cytosol on basal and NO-stimulated activity of sGC. The proteinase K treatment abolished the cGMP-promoting effect (less than 1.5 ± 0.3% activity remaining), suggesting that the cytosolic factor has a protein component. We assessed the stability of the endogenous factor by subjecting the COS-7 cytosol to various temperatures for 15 min prior to the addition to the sGC assay mix (Table I). 50 °C treatment of the cytosolic extract did not significantly affect the cGMP-promoting effect. At 70 °C, 58 and 60% of the cGMP-promoting effect was retained in basal and NO-stimulated conditions, respectively. Treatment at 100 °C virtually eliminated the activating effect, indicating that the factor is heat-labile.Table ICharacterization of the cytosolic factor In all experiments, NO donor SNAP was used at 1 μm. -Fold stimulation corresponds to the effect of 10 μg of cytosol on sGC activity. For temperature sensitivity, NO scavenger effect, and cGMP production measured by RIA, results are the mean ± S.E. of three experiments with each measurement done in duplicate; for Ca2+ -independence, results are the mean ± S.E. of two experiments with each measurement done in duplicate. Variations seen in sGC activity and cytosol effects are probably due to the fact that different purified sGC preparations and several cytosolic batches were used.

https://openalex.org/W2128967279,"Borrelidin, a compound with anti-microbial and anti-angiogenic properties, is a known inhibitor of bacterial and eukaryal threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS). The inhibition mechanism of borrelidin is not well understood. Archaea contain archaeal and bacterial genre ThrRS enzymes that can be distinguished by their sequence. We explored species-specific borrelidin inhibition of ThrRSs. The activity of ThrRS from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 was inhibited by borrelidin, whereas ThrRS enzymes from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus were not. In Escherichia coli ThrRS, borrelidin binding induced a conformational change, and threonine was not activated as shown by ATP-PPi exchange and a transient kinetic assay measuring intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changes. These assays further showed that borrelidin is a noncompetitive tight binding inhibitor of E. coli ThrRS with respect to threonine and ATP. Genetic selection of borrelidin-resistant mutants showed that borrelidin binds to a hydrophobic region (Thr-307, His-309, Cys-334, Pro-335, Leu-489, Leu-493) proximal to the zinc ion at the active site of the E. coli ThrRS. Mutating residue Leu-489 → Trp reduced the space of the hydrophobic cluster and resulted in a 1500-fold increase of the Ki value from 4 nm to 6 μm. An alignment of ThrRS sequences showed that this cluster is conserved in most organisms except for some Archaea (e.g. M. jannaschii, A. fulgidus) and some pathogens (e.g. Helicobacter pylori). This study illustrates how one class of natural product inhibitors affects aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase function, providing potentially useful information for structure-based inhibitor design. Borrelidin, a compound with anti-microbial and anti-angiogenic properties, is a known inhibitor of bacterial and eukaryal threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS). The inhibition mechanism of borrelidin is not well understood. Archaea contain archaeal and bacterial genre ThrRS enzymes that can be distinguished by their sequence. We explored species-specific borrelidin inhibition of ThrRSs. The activity of ThrRS from Sulfolobus solfataricus and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 was inhibited by borrelidin, whereas ThrRS enzymes from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii and Archaeoglobus fulgidus were not.

This study illustrates how one class of natural product inhibitors affects aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase function, providing potentially useful information for structure-based inhibitor design. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; ThrRS, threonyl-tRNA synthetase. catalyze the acylation of transfer RNAs with their cognate amino acids and are therefore essential enzymes for protein synthesis in all organisms (1Ibba M. Söll D. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 382-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). They display exquisite specificity in discriminating between similar amino acid or tRNA substrates. Even though the core architectures of the active sites of individual aaRSs are relatively conserved, protein sequence alignments showed significant divergence among the three domains of life. However, finely tuned structural differences between aaRS orthologs provide ample opportunities for the evolution of species-specific inhibitors of any given tRNA synthetase. For example, mupirocin, an antibiotic produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens, selectively inhibits the prokaryotic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases but has little or no effect on the eukaryotic enzymes (2Silvian L.F.

ThrRS is a class II aaRS containing an N-terminal editing domain, a C-terminal tRNA binding domain, and a zinc-binding catalytic domain with the class II conserved motifs 1, 2, and 3 that provide critical ATP binding determinants (5Sankaranarayanan R.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 213-224PubMed Google Scholar) are specifically inhibited by borrelidin, an 18-membered macrolide-polyketide (Fig. 1) produced by Streptomyces spp (7Hütter R. Poralla K.

Togashi H. Takahashi Y. Masuma R. Tanaka H. Tomoda H. Yamada H. Omura S. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 727-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, borrelidin was found to interfere with capillary tube formation, possibly through anti-angiogenesis effects that are mediated through the ThrRS inhibition and the caspase activation pathways (11Kawamura T. Liu D. Towle M.J. Kageyama R. Tsukahara N. Wakabayashi T. Littlefield B.A. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2003; 56: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Borrelidin also inhibited a S. cerevisiae cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdc28/Cln2), an indication of anti-tumor activity (12Tsuchiya E. Yukawa M. Miyakawa T. Kimura K.I. Takahashi H. J. Antibiot. (Tokyo). 2001; 54: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Gene expression profiling of S. cerevisiae revealed that borrelidin up-regulated GCN4 leucine zipper mRNA synthesis (13Eastwood E.L. Schaus S.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Because of its intriguing biological activities, the chemical synthesis (14Hanessian S. Yang Y. Giroux S. Mascitti V. Ma J. Raeppel F. J. Am. Chem.

To develop borrelidin into an important anti-microbial, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-tumor drug candidate, a fuller understanding of the mechanism of borrelidin inhibition of ThrRS is required. Previous reports showed that borrelidin is a noncompetitive inhibitor with respect to threonine (17Paetz W. Nass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 35: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and inhibits the transfer of activated threonine to tRNAThr (18Monreal J. Paules H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 199: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Characterization of borrelidin resistant mutants showed that resistance resulted from ThrRS overexpression in vivo (19Fröhler J. Rechenmacher A. Thomale J. Nass G. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or from a mutation affecting the Km of threonine (17Paetz W. Nass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 35: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the binding site is not known. Here we report the difference in borrelidin inhibition of the recombinant ThrRSs from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Halobacterium spp., and Archaeoglobus fulgidus as well as the identification of the binding site of ThrRS. General—[3H]threonine, [14C]threonine, and [32P]pyrophosphate were from Amersham Bioscience. Escherichia coli total tRNA was from Sigma. The TOPO-TA cloning kit was from Invitrogen. The QuikChange system for site-directed mutagenesis and Mutazyme kit for error-prone PCR were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Oligonucleotide synthesis and DNA sequencing were performed by the Keck Foundation Research Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose for His6-tagged protein purification was from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. A. fulgidus genomic DNA was a gift from Patricia Hartzell (Moscow, Idaho). The E. coli wild-type strain W3110 and ThrRS temperature sensitive strain EJJ320 (lacY1, tsx-29, glnV44(AS), galK2(Oc), manA4, thrS1029, rpsL700(strR), mtl-1, argE3(Oc)) were from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center. Steady-state measurements were taken using a Photon Technology International (Lawrenceville, NJ) spectrofluorimeter equipped with a water-cooled 150-watt xenon arc lamp. Cloning and Site-directed Mutagenesis of thrS Genes—Primers were designed to PCR-amplify each open reading frame and introduce desired restriction sites. The forward primers contained a restriction site and 20 nucleotide identical to the start sequence of the 5′-end; the reverse primers contained a restriction site and 20 nucleotide complementary to the sequence of the 3′-end. PCR amplified thrS open reading frames from M. jannaschii, S. solfataricus, Halobacterium sp. NRC-1, A. fulgidus, and E. coli DNAs were cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO vector. After verification of the DNA sequences, the genes were subcloned into the expression vectors described below. Specific mutant alleles were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange system. A library of random E. coli thrS mutants was generated by error-prone PCR using the Mutazyme kit. For in vivo tests, the genes were subcloned into the pCBS vector between the KpnI and BglII sites under trpS promoter control. For protein expression, the genes were cloned into pET20b vectors using the XbaI and BamHI sites. In Vivo Testing for ThrRS Activity and Borrelidin Inhibition—ThrRS activity was tested by complementation of E. coli thrSts strain with thrS mutants at 42 °C on minimal medium plate containing casamino acids. Borrelidin-resistant genes were selected on minimal medium plate containing borrelidin. The E. coli thrS mutant library was transformed into W3110, and the transformants were grown in glucose M56 minimal medium (20Low B. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 113: 798-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in the presence of borrelidin (2 mm) overnight. Then the culture was plated on minimal agar plates containing borrelidin to isolate individual borrelidin-resistant colonies for plasmid extraction and further DNA sequencing. The “borrelidin-resistant” thrS mutants were subcloned into pET20b and expressed for biochemical characterization. Preparation of His6-tagged ThrRS—The pET20b-thrS clones were transformed into E. coli BL21 (Codonplus DE3) cells, and the transformants were grown in 500 ml of LB medium with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) to a cell density of A600 = 0.4. At this point, the expression of C-terminal His6-tagged thrS was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Cells were harvested and lysed, and the wild-type and mutant His6-ThrRS proteins were prepared from the cell extracts by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose chromatography to >95% purity as judged by SDS-PAGE after Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Active site titration (21Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was performed for ThrRS preparations by incubating each enzyme in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP (pH 7), 1 mm [14C]threonine (200 cpm/pmol), and 1 unit inorganic pyrophosphatase in a total volume of 0.1 ml at 37 °C for 15-20 min. The wild-type ThrRS enzymes were 80-100% active, whereas the activity of the mutant enzymes varied from 0.1-100% active. These values were used to determine enzyme concentration for calculation of kcat. The enzymes were stored in 40% glycerol buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol) at -20 °C. Aminoacylation of tRNA—Thr-tRNA formation was measured by acid-precipitable radioactivity (21Ahel I. Stathopoulos C. Ambrogelly A. Sauerwald A. Toogood H. Hartsch T. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34743-34748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in 0.1 ml of reaction mixtures containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02-10 mm ATP, 0.01-1 mm [3H]threonine, 4 mg/ml total tRNA (E. coli tRNA for E. coli ThrRSs and M. jannaschii tRNA for other ThrRSs), 0-6000 nm borrelidin, and 0.1-100 nm enzyme. Reactions were carried out in triplicate at 37 °C for E. coli and Halobacterium ThrRS, at 55 °C for S. solfataricus ThrRS, and 65 °C for M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus ThrRS. For steady state kinetic constants Km and kcat measurement, the enzymes were diluted to obtain linear initial velocities. Km and kcat were calculated in KaleidaGraph 3.0 using a Michaelis-Menten equation fit. For Ki measurements, saturating amounts of substrates (0.5 mm threonine, 1 mm ATP, 4 mg/ml tRNA) were mixed with various amounts of borrelidin (0-6 μm). The reaction mixture (ATP, tRNA, ThrRS enzyme) was preincubated in the presence of borrelidin at 37 °C for 3 min, and then threonine was added to initiate the reaction. All experiments were done in triplicate and repeated at least twice. The initial velocities obtained were plotted against borrelidin concentration to obtain IC50 values. The apparent Ki(app) values were calculated based on the simplified equation (Ki(app) = IC50-[E]/2) derived (22Copeland R.A. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VHC, New York2000: 305-317Crossref Google Scholar) for noncompetitive tight binding inhibition. ATP-PPiExchange Assay—Threonine activation was measured by quantitation of [γ-32P]ATP retained on activated carbon (13Eastwood E.L. Schaus S.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2003; 13: 2235-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in 0.2 ml of reaction mixtures containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ATP, 0.01-1 mm threonine, 1 mm KF, 2 mm [32P]pyrophosphate (4 cpm/pmol), 0-2400 nm borrelidin, and 1-100 nm enzyme. The kinetic constants were obtained as described above for the aminoacylation reactions. Presteady State Analysis—Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence changes of the E. coli ThrRS enzyme upon ligand binding were measured by stopped flow and steady-state fluorescence as described previously (23Bovee M.L. Pierce M.A. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15102-15113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 μm ThrRS enzymes, and various substrates. The binding constants were measured by rapidly mixing ThrRS enzyme with various amounts of borrelidin (0-8 μm) at 30 °C. Inhibition of adenylation was measured by rapidly mixing ThrRS enzyme with threonine (0.5 mm), ATP (1.5 mm), and various amount of borrelidin (0-8 μm) at 30 °C. Borrelidin Inhibition of Archaeal and Bacterial ThrRS Enzymes—Phylogenetic analysis of ThrRS sequences (24Woese C.R. Olsen G.J. Ibba M. Söll D. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 202-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 25Beebe K. Merriman E. Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5958-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) showed the existence of markedly different bacterial/eukaryal and archaeal versions of ThrRS. There are large deletions or additions in the N-terminal region of these enzymes; archaeal ThrRS has a shorter N-terminal region, an insertion domain at motif 3 (26Cura V. Moras D. Kern D. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), and many conserved differences in the catalytic domain. In this work we investigated the S. solfataricus and Halobacterium sp. NRC-1 ThrRS, which are more closely related to the bacterial genre enzyme, and the archaeal genre enzymes from A. fulgidus and M. jannaschii. The influence of borrelidin on the enzyme activity was measured in the aminoacylation assay. As shown in Fig. 2, ThrRS from M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus were not inhibited at 1 μm borrelidin, whereas those of S. solfataricus and Halobacterium were inhibited. To compare these enzymes under similar conditions, the ATP-PPi exchange reaction was used for steady-state kinetic measurements. As shown in Table I, the tested ThrRSs had similar Km values for threonine, but the kcat values of ThrRS from M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus were lower than those of the S. solfataricus and E. coli enzymes. The inhibition constants (Ki) for M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus ThrRS were at least 1500 times higher than that of S. solfataricus ThrRS, indicating that the M. jannaschii and A. fulgidus enzymes may not bind borrelidin.Table ISteady-state kinetic constants of ThrRSs from various organismsSource of ThrRSKm (Thr)kcatKiappμmaTo compare the enzymes under the same experiment conditions, kinetic data were determined by ATP-PPi exchange reactions.s-1anmbTo compare the kinetic data with the literature value, the apparent inhibition constants were determined by aminoacylation reactions.E. coli110 ± 5cLiterature value is 110 μm (5).33 ± 3dLiterature value is 36 s-1 (5).3.7 ± 0.3eLiterature value is 3.3 nm (17).S. solfataricus100 ± 516 ± 14.5 ± 0.4A. fulgidus90 ± 53.8 ± 0.3>6000M. jannaschii100 ± 51.2 ± 0.1>6000a To compare the enzymes under the same experiment conditions, kinetic data were determined by ATP-PPi exchange reactions.b To compare the kinetic data with the literature value, the apparent inhibition constants were determined by aminoacylation reactions.c Literature value is 110 μm (5Sankaranarayanan R.

Open table in a new tab The N-terminal Editing Domain Does Not Contribute to Borrelidin Binding—No sequence homology of the N-terminal domain was observed between the borrelidin-inhibited ThrRS and the uninhibited type. Also, S. solfataricus contains two thrS related genes (25Beebe K. Merriman E. Ribas De Pouplana L. Schimmel P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 5958-5963Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 27Korencic D. Ahel I. Schelert J. Sacher M. Ruan B. Stathopoulos C. Blum P. Ibba M. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10260-10265Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); the archaeal genre ThrRS lacks the putative catalytic domain, and the bacterial genre ThrRS lacks most of the entire N-terminal editing domain. The bacterial genre S. solfataricus ThrRS can be inhibited by borrelidin. To determine whether the N-terminal region contributes to borrelidin binding, we aminoacylated E. coli tRNA with wild-type E. coli ThrRS and M. jannaschii tRNA with the A. fulgidus enzyme in the presence or absence of borrelidin. A similar experiment was carried out with the corresponding N-terminal domain-deleted enzymes. As shown in Fig. 3, the E. coli N-terminal-deleted ThrRS was inhibited by borrelidin to the same extent as the wild-type enzyme; the A. fulgidus N-terminal-deleted ThrRS remained uninhibited. Therefore, the N-terminal domain does not contain a borrelidin binding site. Borrelidin Is a Slow but Tight Binding Inhibitor of E. coli ThrRS—The Ki(app) value (3.7 nm) for borrelidin inhibition of E. coli ThrRS was very close to the enzyme concentration (1-2 nm) used, and a linear dose-response of IC50 to the enzyme concentration at a fixed substrate concentration was also observed (data not shown). These results suggested that borrelidin binding is tight and appears to be stoichiometric with dimeric ThrRS. Estimates of on and off rates as well as apparent Kd values for borrelidin were determined from stopped flow fluorescence experiments. As shown in Fig. 4A, borrelidin binding quenched ThrRS fluorescence; this is clear evidence that the method of inhibition cannot be uncompetitive. Single exponential curve fits were used to measure the apparent first order rate constants at a variety of borrelidin concentrations. The apparent rate constants were plotted with respect to borrelidin concentration as shown in Fig. 4B. Rates varied linearly with increasing borrelidin, suggesting a single borrelidin binding step. Estimates of kon and koff can be read directly from the slope and y-intercept, respectively. From this experiment, kon was estimated to be about 5 × 106m-1 s-1. The y-intercept could not be accurately determined because of a requirement for a relatively high enzyme and borrelidin concentrations, but a conservative upper bound of 0.1 s-1 fixes the Kd (koff/kon) at no more than 20 nm; reasonably close to the 4 nm inhibitory constant. Therefore, borrelidin is a tight binding inhibitor of ThrRS. Because of the small off rate, overexpression of thrS might be expected to confer apparent borrelidin resistance to E. coli by virtue of titration of the drug with the excess enzyme (19Fröhler J. Rechenmacher A. Thomale J. Nass G. Böck A. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 1135-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Borrelidin Inhibits E. coli ThrRS at the Step of Threonine Activation—ThrRS catalyzes Thr-tRNAThr formation in two steps (6Freist W. Gauss D.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 213-224PubMed Google Scholar); first it activates threonine to form the adenylate (Thr-AMP), and then it transfers the activated amino acid onto tRNAThr to generate Thr-tRNAThr. Borrelidin was reported to inhibit the second step, the transfer of activated threonine to tRNAThr (18Monreal J. Paules H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 199: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). However, because borrelidin is a tight binding inhibitor, the IC50 values could vary remarkably depending on the enzyme concentration. Therefore, we measured the IC50 value of the same amount of E. coli ThrRS enzyme determined by both ATP-PPi exchange and aminoacylation. ATP-PPi exchange reaction measures the kinetic parameter of the first step, threonine activation; aminoacylation determines the overall formation of Thr-tRNAThr formation. Fig. 5, A and B show that the IC50 values were similar in both reactions; the calculated Ki(app) for E. coli ThrRS in the ATP-PPi exchange reaction (4.2 nm) is very similar to the Ki(app) of 3.7 nm in aminoacylation, indicating that borrelidin inhibits E. coli ThrRS at the first step of threonine activation and thus the overall aminoacylation. To confirm this, presteady-state kinetic analysis of the ThrRS-catalyzed adenylation reaction was carried out in the presence of borrelidin. Fig. 5C shows transient changes in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of ThrRS in the presence or absence of substrates and inhibitor. All data traces were well described by fits to a single exponential function. In the presence of threonine and ATP, the enzyme fluorescence is quenched by 10%, with half the quench amplitude occurring within the dead time of the instrument (bottom fitted trace). This instantaneous quench reflects the enzyme response to the rapid binding of the substrates, whereas the fitted transient corresponds to an isomerization that precedes the chemical step of adenylation (23Bovee M.L. Pierce M.A. Francklyn C.S. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15102-15113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the absence of substrates the fluorescence change is negligible (top trace). The addition of various concentrations of borrelidin to ThrRS prior to rapid mixing with threonine and ATP abolishes the adenylation-associated quench but not that associated with substrate binding, as expected for a noncompetitive inhibitor. At the highest borrelidin concentration, the fluorescence quench includes a small contribution from the prebound borrelidin in addition to the rapid binding of threonine and ATP. Taken together, both steady-state and presteady-state kinetic data showed that borrelidin inhibits ThrRS at the activation step rather than at the transfer step (18Monreal J. Paules H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 199: 280-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Borrelidin Is a Noncompetitive Inhibitor of E. coli ThrRS with Respect to Threonine and ATP—All the data above indicated that borrelidin may bind near or at the active site. To examine whether borrelidin has overlapping binding sites with the other enzyme substrates, we evaluated the inhibition mechanism with respect to threonine and ATP. The Michaelis-Menten derived double-reciprocal plot is commonly used to distinguish the inhibition pattern of reversible inhibitors with the assumption that the free inhibitor concentration could approximate the total concentration of the added inhibitor. However, borrelidin is a tight binding inhibitor that inhibits ThrRS at a very low concentration that is close to the enzyme concentration. Under these conditions the concentration of the enzyme-inhibitor complex is not negligible compared with the inhibitor concentration, so we can not use the double-reciprocal plot method to determine the inhibition patterns of borrelidin. The inhibition pattern was then determined according to the equations derived for tight binding inhibitors (22Copeland R.A. Enzymes. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VHC, New York2000: 305-317Crossref Google Scholar, 28Cha S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1975; 24: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar, 29Williams J.W. Morrison J.F.

Several graphic approaches are available, and the most direct one is to determine the IC50 values for the inhibitor at a fixed enzyme concentration but at different substrate concentrations. For the competitive type, IC50 values increase linearly with increasing substrate concentration; that of the uncompetitive type is linear with the reciprocal value of the substrate concentration, i.e. IC50 values decrease sharply with the increasing substrate concentration. For the noncompetitive type, the relationship between IC50 values and substrate concentration varies depending on the dissociation constant of the inhibitor-enzyme-substrate complex (αKi) and the inhibitor-enzyme complex (Ki). As shown in Fig. 6A, when Ki equals αKi, the equation for a tight binding competitive inhibitor reduces to IC50 = Ki + [E]/2, indicating that substrate binding does not influence the binding of inhibitor to ThrRS enzyme. If αKi < Ki, the inhibitor-enzyme-substrate complex formation is favored over the inhibitor-enzyme complex, indicating that the substrate has a positive influence on inhibitor binding to the enzyme. If αKi > Ki, the substrate must have a negative influence on inhibitor binding to the enzyme. Each IC50 value shown in Fig. 6, B and C was the average of IC50 values determined by d"
https://openalex.org/W2071737762,"The adenoviral protein E4orf6 has been shown to inhibit both in vitro V(D)J recombination and adenoviral DNA concatenation, two processes that rely on cellular DNA double strand break repair (DSBR) proteins. Most of the known activities of E4orf6 during adenoviral infection require its interaction with another adenoviral protein, E1B-55K. Here we report that E4orf6, stably expressed in RKO human colorectal carcinoma cells or transiently expressed by adenoviral vector in U251 human glioblastoma cells, inhibits DSBR and induces significant radiosensitization in the absence of E1B-55K. Expression of a mutant form of E4orf6 (L245P) failed to radiosensitize RKO cells. E4orf6 reduced DSBR capacity in transfected and infected cells, as measured by sublethal DNA damage repair assay and phosphorylated H2AX (γ-H2AX) levels, respectively. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of E4orf6 on DSBR, expression of wild-type but not mutant E4orf6 reduced recovery of a transfected, replicating reporter plasmid (pSP189) in 293 cells but did not increase the mutation frequency measured in the reporter plasmid. The kinase activity of DNA-PKcs (the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) toward heterologous substrates was not affected by expression of E4orf6; however, autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 following ionizing radiation was prolonged in the presence of E4orf6 when compared with control-infected cells. Our results demonstrate for the first time that E4orf6 expression hinders the cellular DNA repair process in mammalian cells in the absence of E1B-55K or other adenoviral genes and suggest that viral-mediated delivery of E4orf6, combined with localized external beam radiation, could be a useful approach for the treatment of radioresistant solid tumors such as glioblastomas.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) 1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double strand break; DSBR, DSB repair; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; MRN, MRE11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex; IR, ionizing radiation; γ-H2AX, phosphorylated H2AX; Gy, grays; CMV, cytomegalovirus; vCMV, vervet CMV.1The abbreviations used are: DSB, DNA double strand break; DSBR, DSB repair; NHEJ, non-homologous end joining; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase; DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit; MRN, MRE11/Rad50/Nbs1 complex; IR, ionizing radiation; γ-H2AX, phosphorylated H2AX; Gy, grays; CMV, cytomegalovirus; vCMV, vervet CMV. occur naturally during DNA replication and V(D)J recombination but are also produced during the treatment of human malignancies with ionizing radiation (IR) and genotoxic drugs. In mammalian cells, the predominant pathway for repairing DSBs is non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex is required for NHEJ. This complex, which includes Ku70, Ku80, and the 450-kDa DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), recruits several other repair proteins, including the MRE11/Rad50/NBS1 complex, XRCC4, and ligase IV (1Smith G. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of proteins and seemingly redundant pathways involved in the processing of DNA damage, targeted gene deletions or mutations of any of the NHEJ proteins in mice results in growth deficiency, immune deficiency from defective V(D)J recombination, hypersensitivity to IR, neuronal apoptosis, and in some cases, tumorigenesis due to increased genomic instability (1Smith G. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 2Sekiguchi J.M. Alt F.W. Quant. Biol. 1999; 64: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). These consequences of defective NHEJ demonstrate the importance of DSBR proteins in maintaining genomic integrity and cellular viability. Conversely, the hypersensitivity of DSBR-deficient cells to IR makes repair proteins an attractive target for radiosensitization of tumor cells with localized beam radiation approaches (3Buchsbaum D.J. Raben D. Stackhouse M.A. Khazaeli M.B. Rogers B.E. Rosenfeld M.E. Liu T. Curiel D.T. Gene Ther. 1996; 3: 1042-1068PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, adenoviral proteins have recently been shown to interfere with the NHEJ pathway to prevent host cell-mediated ligation of the linear adenoviral DNA, which would otherwise lead to viral DNA concatemer formation (4Weiden M. Ginsberg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Stracker T.H. Carson C.T. Weitzman M.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). During adenoviral infection, E4orf6 cooperates with E1B-55K to target p53 and MRE11 for degradation, preventing a p53-mediated anti-viral response and inhibiting the NHEJ-dependent process of concatemer formation (4Weiden M. Ginsberg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Stracker T.H. Carson C.T.

Branton P.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3104-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It is likely that the ability of E4orf6 and E1B-55K to cooperate in suppressing concatemer formation may have evolved as a means of bypassing host cell defenses against viral DNA replication and productive infection. E4orf6, a 34-kDa protein encoded by open reading frame 6 of the E4 gene, has been reported to interact with DNA-PKcs and to inhibit V(D)J recombination in vitro (7Boyer J. Rohleder K. Ketner G. Virology. 1999; 263: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), an NHEJ-dependent process that generates immunological diversity through DNA rearrangements. Since these experiments were performed in 293 cells, which express E1B-55K, it is unknown whether E4orf6 alone can inhibit cellular DSBR or DNA-PKcs activity. The inhibition of NHEJ proteins in suppressing concatemer formation and V(D)J recombination makes E4orf6 an attractive tool for inhibiting cellular NHEJ. Considering that radiation therapy is a frequent treatment for solid tumors and proficient DSBR limits tumor cell kill in response to IR treatment (8Hendry J.H. Radiother. Oncol. 2001; 59: 117-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Ader I. Muller C. Bonnet J. Favre G. Cohen-Jonathan E. Salles B. Toulas C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6471-6479Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the inhibition of DSBR proteins is an attractive approach for tumor radiosensitization (10Li S. Takeda Y. Wragg S. Barrett J. Phillips A. Dynan W.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5848-5857Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Marangoni E. Le Romancer M. Foray N. Muller C. Douc-Rasy S. Vaganay S. Abdulkarim B. Barrois M. Calsou P. Bernier J. Salles B. Bourhis J. Cancer Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the ability of E4orf6 to inhibit NHEJ and to radiosensitize tumor cells. Cell Culture—All cell lines (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. U251 cells were maintained with RPMI 1640 medium, RKO cells were maintained with McCoys5A, and M059 J and K cell lines were maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12, each supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. The M059 cell lines were also supplemented with sodium bicarbonate (1.5 g/liter), non-essential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. RKO stable clones were established by transfection of plasmids (Lipofectamine Plus, Invitrogen) and selection with neomycin (300 μg/ml). Harvested RKO clones were maintained in medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml neomycin. Clonogenic Survival Assay—Clonogenic survival assays were performed as described previously (12Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). For survival assays involving infections, U251 cells were plated in 35-mm plates in triplicate at equal density, infected the next day at a multiplicity of infection predetermined to yield maximal infectivity, and irradiated 48 h later with a 137Cs source (dose rate of 4.41 Gy/min) at a range of IR doses. When unirradiated control plates were near confluency (at or near day 7 after IR), the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet as described previously (12Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Crystal violet was solubilized in 33% acetic acid, and the absorbance at 540 nm was measured in triplicate for each well as described by Bernardi et al. (13Bernardi R.J. Trump D.L. Yu W.-D. McGuire T.F. Hershberger P.A. Johnson C.S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 4164-4173PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—RKO clones and infected cells were harvested as described previously (12Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). For E4orf6, E1B-55K, p53, MRE11, and β-actin immunoblots, lysates (60 μg of total protein) were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blocked for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following antibodies: anti-E4orf6 antibody (monoclonal antibody 3 at 1:100), anti-E1B-55K (9C10 at 1:4), anti-p53 (DO-1 at 1:5000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-MRE11 (12-D7 at 1:5000; GeneTex, San Antonio, TX), anti-β-actin (at 1:50,000; Sigma). DNA-PKcs lysates were resolved on 6% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose overnight at 25 V, and blotted with anti-DNA-PKcs monoclonal antibody (25-4 at 1:5000; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA) or anti-Thr-2609 polyclonal DNA-PKcs antibody (1:1000) (14Chan D.W. B Chen P.-C Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Cells used in γ-H2AX immunoblots were directly lysed in 1.5× SDS sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and passed through a 28-gauge syringe three times. Equal volumes were loaded on 15% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-γ-H2AX antibody (1:5000; Upstate, Charlottesville, VA). All membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and immunoreactive bands were detected using ECL Plus chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The optical density of reactive bands was measured by image analysis software (Scion Image; Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) as described previously (12Koumenis C. Naczki C. Koritzinsky M. Rastani S. Diehl A. Sonenberg N. Koromilas A. Wouters B.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7405-7416Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry—Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy of RKO and U251 cells was performed as described previously (15Orlando J.S. Ornelles D.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) at 48 h after transfection or after infection. The cells were fixed in either methanol:acetone (1:1) or 2% paraformaldehyde, blocked with TBS-BGT (137 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 5.0 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1.0 mg/ml glycine, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.02% sodium azide), and incubated with mouse monoclonal anti-E4orf6 antibody (monoclonal antibody 3 at 1:100 in TBS-BGT) or rat monoclonal anti-E1B-55K (9C10 at 1:100 in TBS-BGT) for 20 min at 37 °C. Primary antibody binding was detected with either Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated goat-anti-rat secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). U251 cells were counterstained with Hoescht 33342 (1 μg/ml in TBS-BGT) or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Mutagenicity Assay—Mutation frequency was measured in a replicating reporter plasmid pSP189 originally described by Parris and Seidman (16Parris C.N. Seidman M.M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The pSP189 shuttle vector was co-transfected with a plasmid to express the wild-type E4orf6 or mutant L245P gene in 293 cells. After 2 days, the shuttle vector was purified by the protocol of Hirt (17Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 40: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified, and mutations within the 158-bp supF gene were identified by transforming the Escherichia coli strain MBL-50. Bacteria containing a mutant supF gene were counted after 48 h of growth on minimal medium containing l-arabinose and ampicillin. The total number of transformants was determined by plating appropriate dilutions of the cells on Luria broth plates containing ampicillin. The amount of material used for each transformation was empirically adjusted so that approximately one-half of 16 independent transformations yielded no supF-mutant colonies. Mutation frequencies were calculated by application of the Poisson distribution. To quantify the amount of replicated plasmid, the Hirt-purified DNA was treated with DpnI and purified, and limiting amounts of the DpnI-treated DNA were used to transform MBL-50 bacteria. The number of transformants was enumerated after plating serial dilutions on Luria broth bacterial plates supplemented with ampicillin. No kanamycin-resistant bacteria were generated from DpnI-treated DNA, confirming that the non-replicating plasmids were inactivated. In Vitro DNA-PKcs Kinase Assays—This protocol is adapted from previously published reports (18Finnie N.J. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Jeggo P.A. Jackson S.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1996; 351: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the SignaTECT DNA-dependent protein kinase assay system manufacturer protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly, cell pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer, lysed by three consecutive cycles of freeze-thawing, and cleared by centrifugation. The high salt lysates (50 μl) were diluted by adding 4 volumes of dilution buffer. Equilibrated double-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma) diluted 1:2 in wash buffer was added to each sample and incubated for at least 30 min on a rocker at 4 °C. Cellulose was pelleted, and the extracted supernatant was re-extracted with 40 μl of cellulose slurry. The combined pellets were resuspended in wash buffer. The cellulose (10 μl) was used in place of the enzyme samples in the SignaTECT kinase reaction (Promega). Terminated reactions were spotted on biotinylated membrane (SAM2®; Promega), and the membranes were washed as described in the protocol. Measurement of radioactivity was performed with a scintillation counter (LS5000CE; Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Statistical Analysis—Where necessary, data were statistically analyzed to generate S.E. values and determine the level of significance using the two-tailed Student's t test. Stable Expression of E4orf6 Radiosensitizes RKO Cells—To examine the effects of E4orf6 on human tumor cell radiosensitivity, we first established clones of RKO human colorectal carcinoma cells stably expressing wild-type E4orf6, a control neomycin resistance gene, or E4orf6-L245P, a non-functional variant during adenovirus infection (15Orlando J.S. Ornelles D.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The wild-type E4orf6 expressed in the RKO cells directed E1B-55K to the nucleus (Fig. 1A) and cooperated with E1B-55K to target p53 and MRE11 for degradation (Fig. 1B), indicating that functional protein was expressed. In contrast, the E4orf6-L245P mutant failed to direct E1B-55K to the nucleus and failed to cooperate with E1B-55K to target p53 and MRE11 for degradation (Fig. 1). Interestingly, reduced levels of E1B-55K protein were observed in the control (neomycin) and L245P cell lines infected with the E4-mutant virus dl1014 (Fig. 1B). Because all the cells were equally infected (data not shown), it seems likely that the decreased E1B-55K protein levels may have resulted from diminished stability of the E1B-55K protein in the absence of a functional E4orf6 protein. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of stable E4orf6 expression in mammalian cells. To determine whether E4orf6 increased the radiosensitivity of the RKO cells, clonogenic survival was analyzed after exposure to a range of IR doses. Two independently isolated clones expressing wild-type E4orf6 were significantly more radiosensitive (10-fold at 8 Gy) than either a vector-transfected clone or an E4orf6-L245P mutant clone (Fig. 2). E1B-55K is not expressed in the clones, indicating that E4orf6 radiosensitizes RKO cells without affecting p53 or MRE11 protein levels. The radiosensitization effect was quantified as a dose enhancement ratio of ∼1.4 over the range of IR doses. Transient Expression of E4orf6 Radiosensitizes U251 Cells— Although E4orf6 radiosensitized two independent RKO clones, it remained possible that random integration of the foreign DNA in the RKO clones, rather than E4orf6 expression, contributed to the radiosensitization effect (19Collis S.J. Ketner G. Hicks J.L. Nelson W.G. Demarzo A.M. DeWeese T.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2003; 79: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To test this, we measured the ability of E4orf6 to radiosensitize human tumor cells following transient expression from a non-replicating and non-integrating adenovirus, a viral vector that is frequently used in cancer gene therapy modalities. Both control virus (vCMV-null) and E4orf6-expressing virus (vCMV-E4orf6) lack the E1 gene, which renders them non-replicative (Fig. 3A) (20Nicolas A.L. Munz P.L. Falck-Pedersen E. Young C.S. Virology. 2000; 266: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Although the vCMV-null virus contains an intact E4 promoter and gene, expression of the E4orf6 protein from the endogenous gene was not detected by either immunoblotting (Fig. 3B) or immunofluorescent microscopy (Fig. 3C), as expected in the absence of the E1 gene products. The vCMV-E4orf6 virus expresses E4orf6 from a CMV promoter and lacks the endogenous viral E4 gene (20Nicolas A.L. Munz P.L. Falck-Pedersen E. Young C.S. Virology. 2000; 266: 211-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and therefore, lacks expression of the other E4 gene products. U251 glioblastoma cells infected with vCMV-E4orf6 were significantly more radiosensitive than those infected with vCMV-null virus (Fig. 4). Thus, transient expression of E4orf6 from a non-integrating, non-replicating adenoviral vector significantly radiosensitizes U251 cells, indicating that E4orf6 expression and not stable integration is responsible for radiosensitization by E4orf6.Fig. 4Transient expression of E4orf6 via infection with a non-replicating adenoviral vector radiosensitizes U251 glioblastoma cells. U251 cells were plated at equal density, mock-infected (closed circles), or infected with either vCMV-null (open triangles) or vCMV-E4orf6 (closed squares) and scored for long term cell survival by crystal violet staining. Absorbance values were normalized to survival at 0 Gy for each infection condition. Significant radiosensitization as determined by a two-tailed Student's t test (n = 3; *, p < 0.05, **, p < 0.005) is marked with the appropriate asterisk.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) E4orf6 Inhibits Cellular DNA DSBR—The inhibition of clonogenic survival (Figs. 2 and 4) and the reported interaction between E4orf6 and DNA-PKcs (7Boyer J. Rohleder K. Ketner G. Virology. 1999; 263: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) led us to hypothesize that E4orf6 radiosensitizes RKO and U251 cells by preventing repair of IR-induced DNA breaks. To test this hypothesis, we measured sublethal damage repair in the RKO clones. The sublethal damage repair assay is a variation of the standard clonogenic survival assay based on the fact that cell survival increases with increasing amounts of time between two doses of sublethal IR, providing that the cells can repair the initial IR damage prior to the second dose (21Elkind M.M. Radiat. Res. 1988; 114: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 22Amorino G.P. Freeman M.L. Choy H. Radiat. Res. 2000; 153: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Amorino G.P. Freeman M.L. Carbone D.P. Lebwohl D.E. Choy H. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1999; 44: 399-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). RKO cells expressing E4orf6 did not benefit from increased time between two radiation treatments of 3 Gy (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the neomycin-transfected control cells demonstrated a 2-fold increase in survival when the two doses were separated by 6 h. This result strongly suggests that the E4orf6-expressing RKO clones have a decreased capacity for DSBR. Recently, is was shown that γ-H2AX can serve as a quantitative measure of DSBs because H2AX is phosphorylated at serine 139 in the region of the DSB and is subsequently dephosphorylated following repair of the DNA break (24Nazarov I.B. Smirnova A.N. Krutilina R.I. Svetlova M.P. Solovjeva L.V. Nikiforov A.A. Oei S.L. Zalenskaya I.A. Yau P.M. Bradbury E.M. Tomilin N.V. Radiat.

DSBR in infected U251 cells was assayed by measuring the levels of phosphorylation of histone 2AX at Ser-139 (termed γ-H2AX) by immunoblotting at various time points after IR (28Watanabe F.

U251 cells were infected with either vCMV-null or vCMV-E4orf6 and irradiated with 4 Gy at 48 h after infection. At several time points after irradiation, cells were harvested and analyzed for γ-H2AX by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Fig. 5B shows that at 6 h after IR, a time at which more than 90% of DSBs should have been repaired, the cells expressing E4orf6 contained substantially higher levels of γ-H2AX when compared with cells infected with control virus, suggesting that unrepaired DSBs accumulate in the presence of E4orf6. This experiment was repeated with similar results, and immunoreactive bands were quantified, normalized to β-actin levels, and expressed as -fold increase when compared with the unirradiated control for each virus (Fig. 5C). In addition, we have analyzed the loss of phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-139 (termed “percent repair”) by examining the difference between the 30 min after IR time point (consistently the maximum level) and the 6-h time point (the point at which most DSBR has occurred) (Fig. 5D). In both cases, E4orf6-expressing U251 cells retain significantly high levels of γ-H2AX, indicative of unrepaired DSBs. E4orf6 Expression Does Not Increase Mutation Frequency—We have demonstrated that E4orf6 radiosensitizes by inhibiting DSBR (measured by sublethal damage repair assay), leading to the accumulation of DSBs (measured by γ-H2AX levels); however, it has been suggested previously that expression of E4orf6 itself may be mutagenic based on the hprt test for mutagenicity (32Nevels M. Tauber B. Spruss T. Wolf H. Dobner T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3089-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine whether the decreased capacity for DSBR was due to increased cellular mutation frequency, 293 cells were transfected with empty expression vector or a vector expressing the wild-type E4orf6 or the mutant L245P gene and a replication-competent reporter vector, pSP189. In a representative experiment (Table I), 293 cells transfected with the empty expression vector and the pSP189 reporter vector exhibited a mutation frequency of 3.5 × 10-7 mutations/bp, consistent with the background mutation frequency reported for this cell line (33Akman S.A. Sander F. Garbutt K. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 2137-2141Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Expression of the wild-type E4orf6 or mutant L245P variants did not increase the mutation frequency. By contrast, exposure of vector-transfected cells to mutagenic levels of UV light (50 J/m2) increased the mutation frequency by nearly 2 orders of magnitude. Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. Thus, although E4orf6 reportedly increases the mutation frequency 2-fold at the chromosomal hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) locus in the D422 Chinese hamster ovary cell line (32Nevels M. Tauber B. Spruss T. Wolf H. Dobner T. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 3089-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), it does not elicit point or frameshift mutations in a replicating plasmid. However, the amount of reporter plasmid recovered from 293 cells expressing the E4orf6 protein was significantly reduced. The results of two independent experiments indicated that expression of E4orf6 in 293 cells for 48 h reduced the amount of recovered pSP189 reporter by 50% when compared with that recovered from cells transfected with the empty expression vector or the L245P construct (Table I). This result is consistent with the ability of the E4orf6 but not L245P protein to block DSBR as naturally occurring DNA breaks are formed and repaired during plasmid replication.Table IMutation frequency and plasmid recoveryPlasmidMutation frequencyPlasmid recoveryPlasmidAveragemut/bp%Vector3.5 × 10-7E4orf649 (46.1, 51.9)E4orf64.3 × 10-7E4orf6-L245P108 (118.9, 97.1)E4orf6-L245P2.3 × 10-7Vector100Vector/UV2.5 × 10-5No plasmid0 Open table in a new tab E4orf6 Does Not Inhibit the Kinase Activity of DNA-PKcs but Prolongs Its Autophosphorylation Following IR—Our results described thus far support a model in which E4orf6 radiosensitizes cells by inhibiting DSBR, perhaps by inhibiting the DNA-PK complex through a direct interaction with DNA-PKcs (7Boyer J. Rohleder K. Ketner G. Virology. 1999; 263: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The effect of E4orf6 on DNA-PK activity was assessed by measuring the ability of DNA-PK to phosphorylate a p53-related peptide in vitro. When expressed in U251 cells by an adenoviral vector, E4orf6 did not affect DNA-PK kinase activity toward a heterologous substrate (Fig. 6A). However, it remains controversial whether p53-phosphorylation is an appropriate measure of DNA-PK activity with regard to DNA repair and radioresistance because DNA-PK-dependent end-joining activity and radiation resistance can be compromised, whereas DNA-PK is still able to phosphorylate p53 (34Ding Q. Reddy Y.V.R. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 35Block W.D. Yu Y. Merkle D. Gifford J.L. Ding Q. Meek K. Lees-Miller S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4351-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Recently, the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs has been identified as a critical factor in maintaining radioresistance, with either hypo- or hyper-autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs resulting in radiosensitization (14Chan D.W. B Chen P.-C Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 36Wechsler T. Chen B.P.C. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C.B. Meek K. Cleaver J.E. Chen D.J. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 37Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Regulation of the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs within a cluster of six serine and threonine sites is important in maintaining radioresistance (14Chan D.W. B Chen P.-C Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that E4orf6 may affect DNA-PK autophosphorylation, which in conjunction with subsequent dephosphorylation is necessary for radioresistance. Following the treatment of infected U251s with IR, autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 was measured over time by immunoblotting with a phospho-specific antibody. Comparable amounts of Thr-2609-phosphorylated DNA-PKcs accumulated in U251 cells infected with either vCMV-E4orf6 or vCMV-null at early time points after irradiation (Fig. 6B). However, in contrast to vCMV-null-infected cells, in which dephosphorylation was near completion 6 h after irradiation, Thr-2609-phosphorylated DNA-PKcs remained up-regulated in E4orf6-expressing cells, which is consistent with a radiosensitive phenotype. The experiment was repeated two more times with similar results. Reactive bands from all three experiments were quantified and normalized to total DNA-PKcs levels (Fig. 6C). Our data identify the adenoviral protein E4orf6 as a radiosensitizer of human tumor cells. We have demonstrated both stable and transient expression of E4orf6 in two different tumor cell lines. This radiosensitization is occurring in the absence of E1B-55K, the adenoviral protein that interacts with E4orf6, an interaction that is required for the degradation of MRE11 and p53 and the inhibition of adenoviral DNA concatemer formation (5Stracker T.H. Carson C.T. Weitzman M.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 6Querido E. Blanchette P. Yan Q. Kamura T. Morrison M. Boivin D. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Branton P.E. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3104-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Our data reveal that E4orf6 is able to radiosensitize tumor cells by inhibiting cellular DNA DSBR in the absence of E1B-55K, and therefore, independent of MRE11 and p53 protein levels. A recent study reported that transient transfection of E4orf6 in a variety of tumor cell lines, including RKO cells, did not result in significant radiosensitization (19Collis S.J. Ketner G. Hicks J.L. Nelson W.G. Demarzo A.M. DeWeese T.L. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 2003; 79: 53-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). We believe that this discrepancy may result from the fact that following transient transfection, not all of the cells express E4orf6, which would be important to accurately assess clonogenic survival following treatment with clinically relevant doses of IR. Furthermore, the lack of radiosensitization by the E4orf6-L245P mutant suggests that the wild-type activity or the proper conformation of E4orf6 is necessary for its radiosensitizing capabilities (the L245P mutation was introduced to disrupt a critical amphipathic α helix in the E4orf6 protein) (15Orlando J.S. Ornelles D.A. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 1475-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Finally, the similar radiosensitization effect measured in two independently selected wild-type E4orf6 clones, as well as the ability of adenoviral-expressed non-integrated E4orf6 to produce a similar effect, suggest that the radiosensitizing property was not the result of positional effects from genomic integration. Our results also argue against the possibility that E4orf6 is mutagenic. The levels of γ-H2AX (DSBs) are similar between vCMV-null- and vCMV-E4orf6-infected cells in the absence of IR, and E4orf6 does not increase the frequency of mutations (point or frameshift) in 293 cells. However, E4orf6 plasmid recovery is reduced when compared with control plasmids, which is consistent with our theory of an inhibition of cellular DSBR by E4orf6. More specifically, during episomal DNA replication, type II topoisomerases transiently introduce double strand breaks in the nascent molecules (38Halmer L. Gruss C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2624-2630Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). If any of the plasmids acquire a double strand break during this process, the inhibition of DSBR by the E4orf6 protein may prevent rejoining of the DNA, thereby reducing the number of intact, replicated plasmids recovered. We have found that expression of E4orf6, although not affecting the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs with regard to heterologous substrates, prolongs the autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609. These data lead us to propose a model (Fig. 7) in which E4orf6 inhibits the late stages of repair as DNA-PKcs remains able to phosphorylate itself in response to DNA damage and repair, but dephosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 is prevented. DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation is Ku-dependent (14Chan D.W. B Chen P.-C Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) and is proposed to occur as a signal for the repair complex to undergo a conformational change conducive to ligation and/or post-ligation dissociation from the DNA (34Ding Q. Reddy Y.V.R. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 35Block W.D. Yu Y. Merkle D. Gifford J.L. Ding Q. Meek K. Lees-Miller S.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 4351-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Two possible modes of action for E4orf6 include either (a) a physical interaction with DNA-PKcs or (b) an inhibition of protein phosphatase 5, the phosphatase implicated in the dephosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 (36Wechsler T. Chen B.P.C. Harper R. Morotomi-Yano K. Huang B.C.B. Meek K. Cleaver J.E. Chen D.J. Wabl M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2004; 101: 1247-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Although E4orf6 has been shown to require E1B-55K to degrade MRE11 and prevent concatemer formation (5Stracker T.H. Carson C.T. Weitzman M.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), our model is consistent with these findings in that regardless of the state of DSB ligation, damage-induced signaling is sustained by phosphorylation of H2AX at Ser-139 and DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609 in the presence of E4orf6 alone. It has been recently proposed that sustained autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs results in a radiosensitive phenotype (14Chan D.W. B Chen P.-C Prithivirajsingh S. Kurimasa A. Story M.D. Qin J. Chen D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2333-2338Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 34Ding Q. Reddy Y.V.R. Wang W. Woods T. Douglas P. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Meek K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5836-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), possibly by signaling incomplete DNA repair and initiating growth arrest or cell death. Our data are in agreement with this model. In summary, we have demonstrated that the adenovirus E4orf6 protein radiosensitizes human tumor cells by inhibiting DSBR without affecting p53 or MRE11 protein levels. E4orf6 promotes the accumulation of DSBs as observed by prolonged phosphorylation of both H2AX at Ser-139 and DNA-PKcs at Thr-2609. Our results show for the first time that an adenoviral protein has radiosensitizing properties by inhibiting the repair of damaged host cell DNA in vivo. A model consistent with our data and that of other investigators is that E4orf6 promotes viral DNA replication by inhibiting cellular NHEJ in an effort to prevent concatenation of viral DNA (4Weiden M. Ginsberg H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Stracker T.H. Carson C.T. Weitzman M.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 7Boyer J. Rohleder K. Ketner G. Virology. 1999; 263: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consequently, overexpression of E4orf6 is sufficient to inhibit the NHEJ response to IR-induced cellular DSBs, thereby radiosensitizing the host cell. The ability of E4orf6 to inhibit the activity of repair proteins other than DNA-PK has not yet been explored. It remains possible that E4orf6 is able to inhibit MRE11 function without degrading it (a process that requires E1B-55K). Future experiments will test such possibilities. The significant radiosensitization achieved at clinically relevant doses (2-8 Gy) by E4orf6 has promising implications for improving radiation therapy, especially in radioresistant tumors such as glioblastomas. It is conceivable that E4orf6 delivered by a viral vector or by non-viral methods could substantially improve the cytotoxic effects of localized beam radiation therapy, such as Gamma knife radiosurgery.

This model agrees with the beaded morphology observed in electron micrographs. Viruses of the Herpesviridae family infect almost all vertebrates, including man, causing a variety of diseases. Of the seven viruses identified as human infectious agents, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) 1The abbreviations used are: HSV, herpes simplex virus; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; SSB, ssDNA-binding protein; OBP, origin-binding protein; SeMet, selenomethionine; MAD, multiwavelength anomalous diffraction; MMA, methyl mercury acetate; OB, oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding; HsmtSSB, human mitochondrial SSB. is the prototype of the αherpesvirus subfamily and of the family as a whole. The HSV-1 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-binding protein (SSB), ICP8, is a nuclear protein that, along with the six other HSV replication proteins (the viral polymerase (UL30) and its accessory factor (UL42), the trimeric helicase-primase complex (UL5-UL8-UL52), and the origin-binding protein (OBP), coded by the gene ul9), is required for viral DNA replication (1Challberg M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9094-9098Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) during lytic infection. Replication has been thought to proceed by a rolling circle mechanism (2Skaliter R. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10665-10669Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) partly because the replication product is a concatamer, although the observation of highly branched replication intermediates could be explained by other mechanisms that would link recombination and replication. ICP8 is a 128-kDa multifunctional zinc metalloprotein (3Gupte S.S. Olson J.W. Ruyechan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11413-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoded by the ul29 gene. It preferentially binds ssDNA over double-stranded DNA in a non-sequence-specific and cooperative manner (4Lee C.K. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 731-738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP8 has been reported to interact either directly or indirectly with several other viral proteins. There is evidence that it binds to the C terminus of the OBP and stimulates its helicase activity (5Makhov A.M. Boehmer P.E. Lehman I.R. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 789-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6He X. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3024-3028Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), that it promotes the helicase activity of the viral helicase-primase complex (UL5-UL8-UL52) (7Falkenberg M. Elias P. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32154-32157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and that it modulates the processivity of the viral polymerase (UL30) (8Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11227-11232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Before viral DNA replication commences, these proteins are thought to be co-localized with ICP8 at small punctuate foci called prereplicative sites. With the onset of viral genome amplification, these proteins become redistributed into a larger globular replication compartment (9Quinlan M.P. Chen L.B. Knipe D.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 857-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) whose location is defined by the preexisting host cell nuclear architecture, most probably at the periphery of the nuclear matrix-associated ND10 domains where the viral transactivator ICP0 and the viral input genome are believed to migrate in the early stages of infection (10Lukonis C.J. Burkham J. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 4771-4781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICP8 is also involved in several other events of the DNA metabolism. It can promote DNA strand transfer (11Bortner C. Hernandez T.R. Lehman I.R. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), catalyze strand invasion in an ATP-independent manner (12Nimonkar A.V. Boehmer P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9678-9682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and renature complementary DNA strands (13Dutch R.E. Lehman I.R. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6945-6949Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which indicates that ICP8 plays an important role in HSV genome recombination. The replication of HSV-1 DNA is also associated with a high degree of homologous recombination. Recently it was shown that ICP8 works together with alkaline nuclease (UL12), which is a 5′-3′-exonuclease, to effect strand exchange (14Reuven N.B. Staire A.E. Myers R.S. Weller S.K. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7425-7433Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in DNA synthesis, ICP8 has been shown to regulate viral gene expression by repressing transcription from the parental genome (15Godowski P.J. Knipe D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) and stimulating late gene expression from progeny genomes (16Chen Y.M. Knipe D.M. Virology. 1996; 221: 281-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Genetic and biochemical analyses have failed to identify functionally independent domains within ICP8. Even the extent of the minimal DNA binding region has remained unclear. It has been placed in the C-terminal half of the protein (17Leinbach S.S. Heath L.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1008: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) or in regions spanning residues 564-1110 (18Gao M. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 300-849 (19Wang Y.S. Hall J.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal 60 amino acid residues were shown to account for most of the cooperative behavior in ssDNA binding (20Mapelli M. Muhleisen M. Persico G. van Der Zandt H. Tucker P.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8812-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), possibly modulated by the two cysteines 254 and 455 (21Dudas K.C. Ruyechan W.T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 257-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that the C-terminal 28 amino acids contain a nuclear localization signal (22Gao M. Knipe D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1330-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), that the residues between 499 and 512 host a zinc binding motif (3Gupte S.S. Olson J.W. Ruyechan W.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11413-11416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that the residues from 1082-1169 are also important for the stimulation of late gene expression (18Gao M. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have reported the first crystal structure of an ssDNA-binding protein of the Herpesviridae, a 60-amino acid C-terminal deletion mutant of ICP8, at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure consists of an unexpectedly large N-terminal folding unit and a small C-terminal α-helical domain, both with novel folds. In addition, it has provided insight into the likely mechanism of cooperative ssDNA binding and tempted us to speculate about the possible interaction with the origin-binding protein. The preparation and crystallization of the ICP8 protein missing the last 60 amino acids of the C terminus and with the mutations C254S and C455S (ICP8ΔCcc) have been described previously (23Mapelli M. Tucker P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification of Selenomethionine-ICP8ΔCcc— Selenomethionine (SeMet)-enriched ICP8ΔCcc was expressed in High 5 insect cells grown as monolayer culture. Confluent cells were infected with the same recombinant virus used for expression of the native protein in a methionine-containing Sf-900II SFM medium (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 2% fetal calf serum. After 30 h, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline solution; methionine-free IPL-41 medium (Applichem) was added for starvation. The methionine-free medium was renewed after 4 h with SeMet-containing (50 mg/l) IPL-41 medium. Cells were incubated for a further 26 h before harvesting. The purification protocol was the same used for the native protein (20Mapelli M. Muhleisen M. Persico G. van Der Zandt H. Tucker P.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8812-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), with the only exception that all buffers were flushed with N2 and supplemented with 10 mm reducing agent (dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol) to overcome a more pronounced tendency of the selenomethionine-containing protein to oxidize and aggregate. Crystallization—SeMet-ICP8ΔCcc crystals were grown at 22 °C in hanging drops by equilibration of 5 mg/ml protein in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaBr, 20% glycerol, 10 mm dithiothreitol against 12-14% polyethylene glycol 3000 and 100 mm sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 6.3. This crystallization condition is similar to that for the native crystal growth. Within about a week, fragile, plate-like crystals (∼0.2 × 0.2 × 0.05 mm3) grew by salting in. For derivatization with methyl mercury acetate (MMA), the protein was first dialyzed against a dithiothreitol-free buffer, then against a 5 mm MMA-containing buffer at pH 7.5, and was subsequently used to set crystallization drops. Plate-like crystals appeared in a week in conditions similar to the ones used for native crystal growth. Crystals formed in space group P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Data Collection, Structure Determination, and Refinement—Both SeMet- and MMA-containing ICP8ΔCcc crystals were cryoprotected by brief soaks in 20% glycerol buffered at pH 6.3 before cryocooling in liquid nitrogen. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data from crystals of SeMet-ICP8ΔCcc were collected at 100 K using synchrotron radiation at the 17-ID IMCA-CAT beamline of the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne) at three/two different wavelengths around the selenium absorption edge. A full diffraction data set was collected for the MMA derivative at 100 K, using the BW7B beam line of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory Hamburg Outstation. The diffraction data were processed using the HKL program package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Macromolecular Crystallography, Part A. 276.

Science. 1991; 254: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). Initially from a first SeMet-containing crystal (CRYST-1), FA values were obtained using XPREP (Bruker-AXS Inc.) to 4.0 Å, enabling the selenium substructure to be solved (50 of 56 seleniums) using the program SHELXD (26Schneider T.R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1772-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Phases were then obtained to 4.0 Å from the two wavelength MAD data. The phases were extended to 3.2 Å by using density modification procedures and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging (27Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). 55% of the model was built using a semiautomatic procedure with the programs MAID (28Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), RESOLVE (29Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Later, phases were extended to 3.0 Å using data from another crystal (CRYST-3, see Table I) by applying multiple crystal averaging (31Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19767) Google Scholar). The resultant phases allowed the Se substructure of CRYST-2 to be determined using an anomalous difference Fourier at 4.0 Å. Then single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering was used to calculate phases, and phase combination was performed to 4.0 Å with the phases generated from multiple crystal averaging. Finally, phases were extended to 3.0 Å using density modification and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging. At this stage, the quality of the map improved significantly. Model building was continued in a similar manner to that described above, and 70% of the model could be built. Refinement of the structure was performed using simulated annealing, followed by positional and restrained B-factor refinement as implemented in CNS (32Brünger A.V. Adams P.P. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). As the model became more complete, a new mask was calculated and used in the multiple crystal averaging and phase combination. Density modification and 2-fold non-crystallographic symmetry averaging were repeated, followed by the semiautomatic procedure for model building. The model produced in this way was nearly complete except for some missing loops, and there was interpretable density for 90% of the residues. In the final stage, refinement was continued using non-crystallographic symmetry restraints and a bulk solvent correction in the program CNS (32Brünger A.V. Adams P.P. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16966) Google Scholar). The refinement was monitored using the free R-factor calculated with 10% of observed reflections. The refinement statistics for CRYST-3 (which, although a mercury derivative, were the best 3.0 Å data) are shown in Table I. Of 1136 residues, 107 residues in chain A and 105 in chain B are not visible in the electron density and are probably disordered. The major disordered loops are located at the interface of the neck and head. The rest of the disordered loops are situated at different parts of the shoulder region and are shown as dotted lines in Fig. 1. Overall geometric quality of the model was assessed using PRO-CHECK (33Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). 86% of the amino acid residues of ICP8 were found in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot, with the remaining residues (apart from Thr908) in the additional and generously allowed regions. All figures were produced using MOLSCRIPT (34Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), PyMol (35De Lano W.L. Pymol User Manual. DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA2002Google Scholar), and RASTER3D (36Merritt E.A. Murphy M.E.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 869-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Modeling of ssDNA—The structure of the EcoSSB-ssDNA complex, where two monomers of EcoSSB cover 26 nucleotides, (37Raghunathan S. Kozlov A.G. Lohman T.M. Waksman G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) was used for the modeling of ssDNA onto the neck region of ICP8. One of the two monomers was superimposed with a monomer of human mitochondrial SSB (HsmtSSB) (38Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) with a root mean square deviation of 1.6 Å on the 97-Cα target pair, and then the monomer of HsmtSSB was overlaid on the neck region of ICP8. In this way the relative orientation of ssDNA was modeled onto the complete structure of ICP8 with the ssDNA covering the neck region of ICP8. The two independent molecules that form the protein chain have different spatial arrangements of the C- and N-terminal domains; however, the distance over the disordered region (1038-1048) is approximately the same (16.1 and 19.2 Å). The relative orientation of ssDNA was created for each monomer of the proposed protein chain formed by applying non-crystallographic symmetry. Visual inspection using computer graphics allowed the nucleotides between two non-crystallographic symmetry-related monomers (chains A and B) and between two crystallographically related monomers (chain B and symmetry mate of chain A) to be added while avoiding clashes with the protein chain. Again the crystallographic symmetry was applied to the newly built nucleotides. In this way, it was possible to join the ssDNA in a continuous chain. In the model the continuous chain of ssDNA contains 98 nucleotides covered by 7 monomers and the distance between 5′- and 3′-ends is 350 Å. The coordinates of the model are available from the authors upon request, and a more detailed illustration is included in the supplemental material. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The structure and function of a number of other prokaryotic and eukaryotic SSBs have been described (39Agrawal V. Kishan K.V. Curr. Protein Pept. Sc. 2003; 4: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but ICP8 is much larger (128 kDa) relative to other SSBs. For example, the monomers of bacterial SSBs are typically ∼20 kDa, and although the heterotrimeric eukaryotic SSB, RepA, is ∼116 kDa, this is believed to contain more than one DNA binding region. Crystallization studies of ICP8 have been reported earlier (23Mapelli M. Tucker P.A. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 219-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), and it was shown that crystals of full-length ICP8 diffracted too poorly to be useful. A mutant, ICP8ΔCcc, with the C-terminal 60 residues deleted and two point mutations (C254S and C455S) has been crystallized under similar conditions to the full-length ICP8 and diffracted to at least 3 Å resolution. The mutant has been shown to bind ssDNA with much reduced cooperativity (22Gao M. Knipe D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1330-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The structure was solved by MAD and single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering methods using SeMet-substituted ICP8. The SeMet crystals formed in space group P212121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit and diffracted to 3.2 Å resolution. The model (residues 9-1129 with the disordered regions described below) was refined to a crystallographic R value of 23.5% (Rfree = 28.6%) using data from 20.0 to 3.0 Å resolution (Table I). Overall Structure—The structure of ICP8 (9-1129) (Fig. 1) is composed of a large N-terminal domain (9-1038) and a smaller α-helical C-terminal domain (1049-1129). The first 8 residues and the last 7 residues of the construct are not visible in the electron density and are presumed to be disordered. The N-terminal domain can be described as consisting of head, neck, and shoulder regions. The head consists of the eight helices α14, α15, α16, α21, α22, α23, α24, and α25 (Fig. 1B). The front side of the neck region consists of a five-stranded β-sheet (β16, β17, β23, β26, and β27) and two helices (α17 and α27), whereas the back side is a three-stranded β-sheet (β24, β25, and β28) (Fig. 1). The shoulder part of the N-terminal domain contains an α-helical and β-sheet region. The head, neck, and shoulders are interconnected in such a way that their individual structural folds are not formed by contiguous polypeptide chains. From the N terminus, the polypeptide chain forms a first helical region in the head and then one of the two β-sheet regions belonging to the neck. The strands β16 and β17 in the neck lead to strands β18-β22 in the shoulders before returning to strands β23-β26 in the neck. The strands β18-β22 are involved in interaction with residues in other strands from the N terminus (see Fig. 1A). This explains why limited proteolysis experiments have never yielded either soluble or functionally active fragments (20Mapelli M. Muhleisen M. Persico G. van Der Zandt H. Tucker P.A. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 8812-8822Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and why so many mutant proteins have proven to be insoluble (see, for example, Ref. 18Gao M. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain (1049-1129) is entirely helical (α28, α29, α30, α31, and α32) and is connected to the N-terminal domain ∼17 Å away by a disordered linker (residues 1038-1049) (Figs. 1 and 2). DNA Binding Region—No structurally related protein can be retrieved from the DALI (40Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3563) Google Scholar) or SSM (www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-srv/ssm/cgi-bin/ssmserver) servers using the whole ICP8 molecule or the individual subdomains as search models. Although no structural homology is detectable for any of the ICP8 regions (Fig. 1), the front side of the neck region shows some structural resemblance to the oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding (OB) fold (41Murzin A.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar), which is responsible for ssDNA binding in all SSBs so far described with the exception of the adenoviral SSB (42Tucker P.A. Tsernoglou D. Tucker A.D. Coenjaerts F.E. van der Leenders H. Vliet P.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2994-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The topology is different (39Agrawal V. Kishan K.V. Curr. Protein Pept. Sc. 2003; 4: 195-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), but the principle is the same, namely a crossed β-sheet with disordered connecting loops containing conserved basic and aromatic residues. The direction of each β-strand of the neck region that resembles the OB-fold is similar to that of HsmtSSB (38Yang C. Curth U. Urbanke C. Kang C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 153-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The proposed DNA binding region on the front side of the neck (Fig. 3A) contains elements of the sequence between amino acids 530 and 1028, similar to the boundaries suggested by Gao and Knipe (18Gao M. Knipe D.M. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 5258-5267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Limited proteolytic analysis studies had suggested that the putative boundaries of the minimal DNA binding region are between residues 300 and 849 (19Wang Y.S. Hall J.D. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 2082-2089Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent evidence, based on ICP8 photo-affinity labeling with oligonucleotides, indicated a slightly different region, namely between residues 386 and 902 (43White E.J. Boehmer P.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 493-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). There are a number of aromatic and positively charged residues from the front side of the neck that are exposed to the surface or lie in the disordered loops that are relatively well conserved across the Herpesviridae. These are Tyr543, Asn551, Arg772, Lys774, Arg776, Tyr988, Phe998, and Asn1002 (Fig. 4), which we believe are involved in ssDNA binding either by base stacking or electrostatic interactions.Fig. 4Structure-based sequence alignment of the ICP8 of Herpesviridae from three subfamilies. Representatives from three genus of the Alphaherpes virus subfamily (Simplexvirus, Varicellavirus, Marek's disease-like viruses), three genus from the Betaherpes virus subfamily (Roseolovirus, Cytomegalovirus, Muromegalovirus), and two genus from the gammaherpes virus subfamily (Rhadinovirus, Lymphocryptovirus) are used in the sequence alignment. The Swiss-Prot codes of ICP8 orthologues from these sources are P04296, Q89549, Q9E6P0, O56282, P17147, P30672, O36360 and P03227, respectively. Horizontal cylinders above the sequences indicate α-helices (labeled α1-α32). Horizontal arrows indicate β-strands (labeled β1-β28). The secondary structure elements are colored red for the head, blue and orange for the shoulder, yellow and gray for the neck region of the N-terminal domain (a similar color code is used in Fig. 1A), purple for the C-terminal helical domain, and light green for the zinc binding loop, including two helices (α12 and α13) that are involved in interaction with part of the N and C termini. Three cysteines and a histidine involved in binding to zinc are shown by a bar above the corresponding residues. The dotted lines indicate regions that are disordered inthe crystal structure. The dashed line indicates that the region was absent in the construct. The triangle above 3 residues in the C-terminal region (last 60 residues) indicates the region encompassing the FNF motif.

One of these, Pet100p, is required for cytochrome c oxidase. Previous studies have shown that Pet100p is not required for the synthesis, processing, or targeting of cytochrome c oxidase subunits to the mitochondrion nor for heme A biosynthesis. Here, we report that Pet100p does not affect the localization of cytochrome c oxidase subunit polypeptides to the inner mitochondrial membrane but instead functions after they have arrived at the inner membrane. We have also localized Pet100p to the inner mitochondrial membrane in wild type cells, where it is present in a subassembly (Complex A) with cytochrome c oxidase subunits VII, VIIa, and VIII. Pet100p does not interact with the same subunits after they have been assembled into the holoenzyme. In addition, we have identified two subassemblies that are present in pet100 null mutant cells: one subassembly (Complex A′) is composed of subunits VII, VIIa, and VIII but not Pet100p, and another subassembly (Complex B) is composed of subunits Va and VI. Because pet100 null mutant cells lack assembled cytochrome c oxidase but accumulate Complexes A′ and B it appears likely that these subassemblies of cytochrome c oxidase subunits are intermediates along an assembly pathway for holocytochrome c oxidase and that Pet100p functions in this pathway to facilitate the interaction(s) between Complex A′ and other cytochrome c oxidase subassemblies and subunits.

Cytochrome c oxidase is a multimeric protein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane in eukaryotes. It is assembled from polypeptides encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (1Poyton R.O. McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and plays an important role in the regulation of cellular energy production (2Babcock G.T. Wikstrom M.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, active cytochrome c oxidase is composed of nine different polypeptide subunits as well as four redox-active metal centers (heme a, heme a3, CuA, and CuB) (1Poyton R.O.

All three of these polypeptides are translated on mitochondrial ribosomes and are inserted co-translationally into the mitochondrial inner membrane (9Poyton R.O. Bellus G. McKee E.E. Sevarino K.A.

These polypeptides are translated by cytosolic ribosomes, imported into the mitochondrion and assembled, along with the mitochondrially encoded subunits and the prosthetic groups, into a functional holoenzyme.The two different pathways followed by compartmentally separated gene products, import of nuclear-encoded proteins (14Glick B.

Although the mitochondrial import pathways have been elucidated (for review, see Ref. 15Wiedemann N. Frazier A.E. Pfanner N. J. Biol.

Some of the proteins act globally and affect assembly of many mitochondrial proteins. These include heat shock proteins, which function as part of the import or sorting pathways that localize nuclear-coded polypeptides to the mitochondrial inner membrane (23Schatz G. J. Biol.

McEwen J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 563-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). These assembly facilitators do not appear to affect other cytochromes of the respiratory chain.To examine how assembly facilitators function we have been studying Pet100p. Previously, we cloned and characterized the PET100 gene and found that Pet100p is not required for synthesis, processing, or localization of cytochrome c oxidase subunits to mitochondria (38Church C. Chapon C. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18499-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), does not affect the biogenesis of other mitochondrial cytochromes, and is not required for heme A synthesis. We have also found that the COOH-terminal 62 amino acids in Pet100p are important for Pet100p function (41Forsha D. Church C. Wazny P. Poyton R.O. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 436-441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have found that Pet100p is not required for normal mitochondrial morphology (43Church C. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1729-1737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and, hence, does not affect cytochrome c oxidase assembly indirectly through a generalized effect on mitochondrial structure.In this study, we sought to determine when and how Pet100p functions in the assembly of holocytochrome c oxidase. First, we determined the intracellular location of Pet100p. Next, we examined its relationship to holocytochrome c oxidase, its polypeptide subunits, and cytochrome c oxidase subcomplexes. Finally, we looked at the effects of a pet100 null mutation on the localization of cytochrome c oxidase subunits and the intracellular levels of subassemblies in which they reside.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Media—The following S. cerevisiae strains were used: JM43 (Matα his4–580, leu2–3, 112 ura3–52 [ρ+] (17McEwen J.E.

They were grown at 30 °C in YPGal (1% Difco yeast extract, 2% Difco Bacto-peptone, 2% galactose).Isolation of Mitochondria and Cytosol—For preparation of mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions, cells were grown to mid-exponential phase, harvested, and spheroplasted as described (12Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Caughey W. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 110-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. Spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (5 min at 3,000 × g), washed gently in post-spheroplast buffer (1.5 m sorbitol, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% BSA, 1The abbreviations used are: BSA, bovine serum albumin; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. pH 7.0), and sedimented at 3,000 × g for 5 min. Washed spheroplasts were resuspended in lysis buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4), lysed in a Sorvall Omnimixer (Newton, CT) at low speed for 3 s and at full speed for 45 s, and then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,900 × g to pellet unbroken cells, nuclei, and debris. The resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,100 × g to pellet mitochondria. The mitochondrial pellet was washed by resuspension in mitochondrial lysis buffer minus BSA (pH 7.0), homogenized with a glass/Teflon homogenizer, and centrifuged at 1,651 × g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was decanted and centrifuged at 23,500 × g for 10 min to pellet the mitochondria. The post-mitochondrial supernatant, collected after the 23,500 × g centrifugation, was used as the cytosolic fraction.Subfractionation of Mitochondria—Mitochondrial subfractions were prepared by a modification of the digitonin fractionation procedure (46Velours J. Guerin B. Duvert M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 182: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To prepare mitoplasts, mitochondria were suspended at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml of mitoplast suspension buffer (0.6 m mannitol, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0) and a 1-ml portion of the suspension was treated for 1 min on ice with 0.35 mg of digitonin/mg of mitochondrial protein. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. The suspension was diluted immediately with 5 volumes of mitoplast suspension buffer and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 × gmax. The pellet is the mitoplast fraction. The supernatant was carefully separated from the pellet and centrifuged for 60 min at 144,000 × gmax. The resulting pellet and the supernatant were used as the outer mitochondrial membrane and the intermembrane space fractions, respectively. The inner membrane and matrix fractions were prepared from the mitoplasts, collected above, as follows. Mitoplasts were resuspended at 10 mg of protein/ml in 100 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0) and sonicated for 20 s at 50 watts with a Branson Sonifier (model W 185) equipped with a microtip. Sonicated mitoplasts were centrifuged for 20 min at 95,000 × gmax. The pellet is the inner membrane fraction and the supernatant is the matrix fraction. The pellet was washed by resuspension in 100 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.0) and recovered by centrifugation at 95,000 × gmax for 20 min.Carbonate Extraction of Mitochondria—An aliquot (1 mg of protein) of isolated mitochondria was resuspended in 0.1 m Na2CO3 (pH 12) to a final concentration of 0.15 μg of protein/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min (29Schulze M. Rodel G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 216: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Non-extractable integral membrane proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 × gmax for 1 h. Extractable peripheral and soluble proteins were recovered from the supernatant by precipitation with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was adjusted to a final concentration of 10% trichloroacetic acid, incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × gmax. Both non-extractable and extractable protein pellets were washed once in ice-cold 100% acetone, air dried, and resuspended in SDS-PAGE protein dissociation buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 8% glycerol, 40 mm dithiothreitol).Sucrose Gradient Analysis of Lysed Mitochondria—To identify conditions that give the best solubilization of yeast mitochondrial membranes and recovery of active cytochrome c oxidase, we compared a variety of detergents (Triton X-100, lauryl maltoside, cholate, deoxycholate, octyl glucoside, and Zwittergent-14) and detergent/protein ratios. These studies revealed that Triton X-100 at a ratio of 4 mg of Triton X-100 to 1 mg of mitochondrial protein was best for membrane solubilization and that optimal recoveries of enzyme activity and peak sharpness were achieved on 5–50% sucrose gradients containing 7 mm Triton X-100. These conditions were incorporated into the following protocol. An aliquot (1 mg of protein) of freshly isolated mitochondria was washed in SEM buffer (250 mm sucrose, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.2) and centrifuged for 4 min at 4 °C at 16,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge. The resulting pellet was re-suspended in 300 μl of 2× lysis buffer (20 mm KPO4, 15% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, pH 7.4). After a 5-min incubation at room temperature, Triton X-100 (Surfact-Amps X-100, Pierce Chemicals) was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 3 mg/mg mitochondrial protein. The incubation was continued for another 10 min at room temperature. Lysed mitochondria were applied to a linear 5–50% sucrose gradient containing 10 mm KPO4 (pH 7.0) and 0.1% Triton X-100 made with a Hoefer Scientific Instruments SG series gradient maker. The gradient was centrifuged overnight (12–16 h) at 284,000 × gmax in a Beckman SW 41 rotor at 4 °C. The gradient was fractionated into 400-μl aliquots, collected from the top of the gradient, using an Isco Density Fractionator (model 185). Sucrose densities were determined by measuring the refractive indices of gradient fractions with a refractometer. Aliquots (50 μl) of each fraction were precipitated with 200 μl of 100% acetone containing 25 μg of BSA at –20 °C for 30 min. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation in a Microfuge (10 min at 4 °C, 16,000 × g). Pellets were washed once with 80% acetone for 10 min at 4 °C and collected by centrifugation as above. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the remaining acetone was allowed to evaporate. Pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE protein dissociation buffer (20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 8% glycerol) and stored frozen until ready for analysis by SDS-PAGE.Purification of Cytochrome c Oxidase and Subunit Polypeptides— Yeast holocytochrome c oxidase was prepared by Method 1 described in Poyton et al. (4Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Holoenzyme preparations of various purities were obtained by taking fractions from different points in the purification procedure. To prepare holocytochrome c oxidase for subunit isolation we used Method 2 (4Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase subunit polypeptides were prepared by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography, as described (47Power S.D. Lochrie M.A. Sevarino K.A. Patterson T.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6564-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purity of each subunit was assessed by SDS-PAGE and microsequencing (47Power S.D. Lochrie M.A. Sevarino K.A. Patterson T.E. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 6564-6570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Only subunit preparations that contained a single amino-terminal microsequence were used.Preparation of Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies were prepared to Pet100p, holocytochrome c oxidase, and subunits I, II, IV, Va, VI, VII, VIIa, and VIII of cytochrome c oxidase. For Pet100p, an antibody was obtained against a peptide synthesized to correspond to residues 93 to 111 at the carboxyl terminus of the PET100 gene product. The peptide was made by BioSynthesis Inc. and coupled to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemacyanin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's directions. The peptide-keyhole limpet hemacyanin conjugate was mixed with Freund's Complete adjuvant (Sigma) and 1 mg of conjugate was injected subcutaneously into New Zealand White rabbits. Booster injections (0.5 mg) were given with Freund's Incomplete adjuvant at 2 and 8 weeks. Antisera were collected at 2-week intervals with the terminal collection at 12 days following the final boost. Antibodies to the holocytochrome c oxidase and subunits were prepared as described (48Poyton R.O. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 762-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The antiserum to subunit V was made to a synthetic peptide that duplicates the 20-amino acid sequence common to both Va and Vb at their carboxyl terminus. The IgG fraction was prepared from antiserum by ammonium sulfate fractionation. An aliquot (2 ml) of antisera was diluted with an equal volume of 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 15 mm NaCl. IgG was precipitated twice with ammonium sulfate at 40% (w/v) with stirring for 10 min at 25 °C, and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 5 min. The final precipitate was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 15 mm NaCl, dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, and microcentrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was collected and used as the IgG fraction.Immunoprecipitation—The IgG fraction of each antisera was bound to Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences), prepared in 100 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, as follows. An aliquot (100 μl) of the IgG fraction was absorbed to 100 μl of prepared beads in 1 ml of immunobuffer (10 mm NaPO4 (pH 7.4), 15 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 5 h with rocking. Unbound antiserum was removed by washing beads twice with immunobuffer. For immunoprecipitation, IgG bound beads were incubated with either lysed mitochondria or sucrose gradient fractions from lysed mitochondria, as indicated in the appropriate figure legends. In each case, the total volume was adjusted to 1.3 ml with immunobuffer and the samples were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking. To remove unbound protein, beads were washed four times with immunobuffer and then once with water. For Western analysis, protein was released from antibody beads in an equal volume of dissociation buffer (20 mm NaPO4 (pH 6.8), 4% SDS, 8% glycerol, 40 mm dithiothreitol) and boiled 2 min prior to loading on SDS-polyacrylamide gels.Miscellaneous Methods—Western analysis and SDS-PAGE were performed on 16% polyacrylamide gels containing 10% glycerol and 3.6 m urea, as described (38Church C. Chapon C. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18499-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Protein determination was performed by the Lowry assay (49Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using BSA as a standard. Cytochrome c oxidase activity assays were performed as described (4Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A. Allen L.A. Zhao X.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 97-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).RESULTSPET100 Is Not Required for Localization of Cytochrome c Oxidase Subunits to the Inner Mitochondrial Membrane—Previously, we have found that PET100 is required for the biogenesis of holocytochrome c oxidase but is not essential for the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase subunit polypeptides, their processing, or their localization to the mitochondrion (38Church C. Chapon C. Poyton R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18499-18507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that Pet100p functions late in the biogenesis of cytochrome c oxidase, either to sort the subunit polypeptides to the inner mitochondrial membrane or to assemble them into the holoenzyme once they have arrived at the inner membrane. To address which of these possibilities is correct we compared the distribution of cytochrome c oxidase subunits in cell and mitochondrial subfractions from JM43 and JM43GD100, a pet100 null mutant. From the results shown in Fig. 1A it is clear that cytochrome c oxidase subunit polypeptides could be detected in all cell fractions from JM43 that contained the inner mitochondrial membrane (i.e. mitochondria, mitoplasts, and the isolated inner membrane fraction). They were not detected in the cytosol or intermembrane space fractions. Low levels of subunits IV and VI were also detected in the matrix fraction. This is not surprising because these polypeptides are hydrophilic peripheral proteins, are easily dislodged from the membrane and holoenzyme (4Poyton R.O. Goehring B. Droste M. Sevarino K.A.

Low levels of yeast cytochrome c oxidase subunits I, II, III, VII, VIIa, and VIII were also detected in the outer membrane fraction. These polypeptides are hydrophobic integral proteins of the inner membrane that are only dislodged in the presence of detergent (47Power S.D. Lochrie M.A. Sevarino K.A. Patterson T.E. Poyton R.O. J.

https://openalex.org/W2058894323,"The alpha-interacting domain (AID) in the I-II linker of high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channel α1 subunits binds with high affinity to CaVβ auxiliary subunits. The recently solved crystal structures of the AID-CaVβ complex in CaV1.1/1.2 have revealed that this interaction occurs through a set of six mostly invariant residues Glu/Asp6, Leu7, Gly9, Tyr10, Trp13, and Ile14 (where the superscript refers to the position of the residue starting with the QQ signature doublet) distributed among three α-helical turns in the proximal section of the I-II linker. We show herein that alanine mutations of N-terminal AID residues Gln1, Gln2, Ile3, Glu4, Glu6, Leu7, and Gly9 in CaV2.3 did not abolish [35S]CaVβ1b or [35S]CaVβ3 subunit overlay binding to fusion proteins nor did they prevent the typical modulation of whole cell currents by CaVβ3. Mutations of the invariant Tyr10 with either hydrophobic (Ala), aromatic (Phe), or positively charged (Arg, Lys) residues yielded CaVβ3-responsive whole cell currents, whereas mutations with negatively charged residues (Asp, Glu) disrupted CaVβ3 binding and modulation. In contrast, modulation and binding by CaVβ3 was significantly weakened in I14A (neutral and hydrophobic) and I14S (neutral and polar) mutants and eradicated in negatively charged I14D and I14E or positively charged I14R and I14K mutants. CaVβ3-induced modulation was only preserved with the conserved I14L mutation. Molecular replacement analyses carried out using a three-dimensional homology model of the AID helix from CaV2.3 suggests that a high degree of hydrophobicity and a restrained binding pocket could account for the strict structural specificity of the interaction site found at position Ile14. Altogether these results indicate that the C-terminal residues Trp13 (1Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys.

Molecular replacement analyses carried out using a three-dimensional homology model of the AID helix from CaV2.3 suggests that a high degree of hydrophobicity and a restrained binding pocket could account for the strict structural specificity of the interaction site found at position Ile14. Altogether these results indicate that the C-terminal residues Trp13 (1Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1429-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Ile14 anchor CaVβ subunit functional modulation of HVA Ca2+ channels. The passage of Ca2+ in a selective manner across the lipid bilayer of the cellular plasma membrane occurs by way of several transport proteins. The voltage-dependent calcium channel (VDCC) 1The abbreviations used are: VDCC, voltage-dependent calcium channel; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s.d., root mean-squared deviation; GFP, green fluorescent protein; AID, alpha-interacting domain; HVA, high voltage-activated; LVA, low voltage-activated; VDI, voltage-dependent inactivation; SH3, Src homology 3 domain; GK, guanylate kinase. represents one key pathway that regulates the entry of extracellular calcium into electrically excitable cells. VDCC are multimeric proteins composed of the transmembrane pore-forming CaVα1, the disulfide-linked dimer CaVα2δ, the intracellular CaVβ subunits (β1-β4), and in some cases the CaVγ subunit (2Catterall W.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 521-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar). To this date, the primary structures for 10 distinct VDCC α1 subunits have been identified by molecular cloning and shown to belong to three main families: the classical L-type high voltage-activated (HVA) VDCC form the CaV1 class; CaV2 are non-L-type HVA VDCC; and CaV3 are the T-type VDCC that are activated at low voltage (LVA). Although a minimum VDCC can be formed by a single CaVα1 subunit, co-expression with auxiliary CaVβ subunits is required for HVA CaV channels such as the cardiac L-type CaV1.2 (3Singer D. Biel M.

Biol. 1997; 160: 127-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The four known auxiliary CaVβ subunits can potentially associate with any of the six CaVα1 pore-forming subunits of HVA VDCC (CaV1.1-1.4, CaV2.1-2.3) via the alpha interaction domain (AID) located on the I-II linker of the CaVα1 subunit. The AID motif is absent from LVA T-type (CaV3.1-3.3) VDCC for which CaVβ subunit modulation has never been reported. About half of the residues of the AID helix (Gln1-Gln2-X3-Glu4-X5-X6-Leu7-X8-Gly9-Tyr10-X11-X12-Trp13-Ile14-X15-X16-X17-Glu18) are strictly conserved (in bold) among the six CaVα1 subunits but homology was found to be higher within members of the CaV1 and CaV2 families. Nonetheless, positions 8, 11, and 15 are occupied by residues that could vary even within the same CaV family (Table I). The AID motif Gln1-Gln2-X3-Glu4-X5-X6-Leu7-X8-Gly9-Tyr10-X11-X12-Trp13-Ile14-X15-X16-X17-Glu18 (where X can be any residue) might not be the unique determinant of the CaVα1-β interaction. In vitro binding experiments have revealed the presence of additional interaction sites of lower affinity on the cytoplasmic loops of CaV2.1 (16Cens T. Restituito S. Vallentin A. Charnet P. J. Biol.

The three-dimensional structures of the conserved core region of CaVβ2a and CaVβ3, alone and in complex with the AID peptide from CaV1.1 or CaV1.2 channels, show that the CaVβ subunit core contains two interacting domains: a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase (GK) domain connected by a HOOK region similar to the one found in PSD95 (19Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 20Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L.

The BID (CaVβ interaction domain) is essential both for the structural integrity of the CaVβ subunit and for bridging the SH3 and GK domains, but does not participate directly in binding the CaVα1 subunit. The AID peptide from the CaVα1 subunit adopts an α-helical structure upon binding to the CaVβ subunit, and the six AID residues from the three main α-helical turns nestle into the hydrophobic groove found in the GK domain opposite to the SH3 domain in the CaVβ subunit. The hydrophobic face of the AID helix aptly named the “alpha-binding pocket” (ABP) contains 7 residues X3, X6, Leu7, Gly9, Tyr10, Trp13, and Ile14 (or Ile376, Glu379, Leu380, Gly382, Tyr383, Trp386, and Ile387 in CaV2.3) that interact with the CaVβ subunit. The interaction between the AID helix and the CaVβ protein appears to be primarily secured by the projection of the AID C-terminal pairs Gly9/Tyr10 and Trp13/Ile14 onto the CaVβ fold (21Opatowsky Y. Chen C.C. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Both Tyr10 and Trp13 are buried completely within the CaVβ protein. Tyr10 makes multiple van der Waals interactions with CaVβ through its main chains while its side-chain hydroxyl group forms hydrogen bonds with two water molecules, the side-chain of Asp6, and the main chain of Ile14 (19Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Trp13 plays a central role by forming six van der Waals interactions with residues of CaVβ subunits and one hydrogen bond with the main-chain carbonyl of a methionine residue in CaVβ subunit. Ile14 forms three van der Waals interactions with residues of CaVβ subunits (19Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 20Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Gly9 appears to be entrenched within the CaVβ fold like Tyr10 and almost to be as inaccessible as Trp13 and Ile14 (19Van Petegem F. Clark K.A. Chatelain F.C. Minor Jr., D.L. Nature. 2004; 429: 671-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), but the extent of its interaction with CaVβ remains debatable (20Chen Y.H. Li M.H. Zhang Y. He L.L. Yamada Y. Fitzmaurice A. Shen Y. Zhang H. Tong L. Yang J. Nature. 2004; 429: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 21Opatowsky Y. Chen C.C. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. Neuron. 2004; 42: 387-399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The extensive network of interactions between the two subunits, mostly hydrophobic in nature, probably account for the nanomolar affinity between the CaVα1 and the CaVβ subunits (22Canti C. Davies A. Berrow N.S. Butcher A.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1439-1451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 23Opatowsky Y. Chomsky-Hecht O. Kang M.G. Campbell K.P. Hirsch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52323-52332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structures vividly account for a wealth of structure-function data gathered over the last decade. Functional studies have long shown the YWI residues to be critical for CaVβ1b and/or CaVβ3 binding in CaV2.1 (24DeWaard M. Scott V.E. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Let. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that point mutations of the conserved Trp13 (Trp386) eliminated the functional modulation of CaV2.3 currents by CaVβ3 as well as disrupted the CaVβ3 subunit binding to the AID peptide (1Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1429-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The stereochemical requirements at this position were strict since substitutions with either hydrophobic (Ala, Gly), hydrophilic (Gln, Arg, Glu), and aromatic (Phe, Tyr) residues led to the same results suggesting that Trp13 (Trp386) played a unique role in CaVβ subunit binding and modulation of CaV2.3 channels. Y10F preserved in part CaVβ3 and CaVβ2 binding but preserving the hydroxyl side-chain in Y10S and conserving the aromatic group in the Y10W mutant led nonetheless to a significant decrease in CaVβ2, CaVβ3, and CaVβ1b binding to AIDA (CaV2.1) (24DeWaard M. Scott V.E. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. FEBS Let. 1996; 380: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Witcher D.R. De W.M. Liu H. Pragnell M. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18088-18093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This observation was also confirmed in CaV1.2 and CaV1.1 channels where the Y10S mutant disrupted the plasma membrane localization of the CaVα1 subunit while preserving in part the CaVβ subunit-induced modulation of whole cell currents (26Neuhuber B. Gerster U. Doring F. Glossmann H. Tanabe T. Flucher B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5015-5020Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27Neuhuber B. Gerster U. Mitterdorfer J.

Physiol. (Lond). 1999; 517: 353-368Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In contrast, point mutations of Gln1, Gln2, Glu4, Leu7, Gly9, and Glu16 failed to abolish the binding of CaVβ3 to the denatured AID peptide from CaV2.1 (13Bichet D. Cornet V. Geib S. Carlier E. Volsen S. Hoshi T. Mori Y. DeWaard M. Neuron. 2000; 25: 177-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) suggesting that the stereochemical requirements might not be as strict in these positions to achieve a strong interaction with CaVβ subunits. In contrast, there is very little information regarding the role of the N-terminal pair of residues Glu6/Leu7 in establishing the functional interaction with CaVβ subunits although the crystal structures have demonstrated a strong interaction between the two subunits at this site. It thus remains to be seen whether all of these CaVAID-CaVβ interaction sites are required to confer the typical CaVβ subunit-induced functional modulation of CaV1 and CaV2 currents. Herein we show that the alanine mutation of each of the AID residues Gln1, Gln2, Glu3, Glu4, Glu6, Leu7, Gly9, and Glu18 did not eliminate [35S]CaVβ1b or [35S]CaVβ3 subunit overlay binding to fusion proteins nor did it prevent the typical modulation of CaV2.3 whole cell currents by CaVβ3. Mutations of Tyr10 with either aromatic (Phe) or positively charged (Arg, Lys) residues yielded whole cell currents that responded to CaVβ3 essentially like the wild-type channel whereas mutations with negatively charged residues (Asp, Glu) disrupted CaVβ3 binding and modulation. The structural requirements were more stringent for Ile14 since the modulation and binding by CaVβ3 were only preserved with the conserved Iso to Leu mutation. Altogether these results suggest that the C-terminal residues Trp13 (1Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1429-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and Ile14 play a more critical role than Gly9 and Tyr10 in CaVβ subunit functional modulation of HVA Ca2+ channels. Recombinant DNA Materials—Standard methods of plasmid DNA preparation were used (29Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The rat brain CaVα2bδ subunit was provided by Dr. T. P. Snutch. Point Mutations and RNA Transcription—Point mutations were performed with 40-mer synthetic oligonucleotides using the QuikChange™ XL-mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, mutations were achieved by cassette cloning using the NotI/XhoI CaV2.3 fragment (positions 111 and 1275 nt) subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene). Constructs were verified by restriction mapping after religation of the mutated fragment into the naturally occurring NotI/XhoI sites of the wild-type CaV2.3. The nucleotide sequence of the mutant channels was confirmed through automated fluorescent DNA sequencing (BioST, Lachine, Qué). cDNA constructs for wild-type and mutated CaVα1 subunits were linearized at the 3′-end by HindIII digestion whereas the CaVβ3 subunit was digested by NotI. Run-off transcripts were prepared using the methylated cap analog m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G and T7 RNA polymerase with the mMessage mMachine® transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The final cRNA products were resuspended in DEPC-treated H2O and stored at -80 °C. The integrity of the final product and the absence of degraded RNA were determined by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. CaVβ3 and CaVβ1b Overlay Assays onto pGFP-uv Fusion Proteins—A fragment of 105 bp including the whole AID region of CaV2.3 (25-residue AIDE peptide) was generated by polymerase chain reaction and cloned in-frame into the HindIII-KpnI sites of pGFPuv vector (GenBank™ U62636) (Clontech, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Ontario) to give a fusion protein with an estimated molecular mass of 32 kDa. The AID-fusion protein was expressed in the chemically competent Escherichia coli strain DH5α. The synthesis of the fusion proteins was induced at 37 °C using 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside in an overnight liquid culture, and bacteria were collected by centrifugation. As the GFP protein cloned in-frame with the AIDE peptide has been modified to fluoresce under UV light, the fusion protein confers a green color to the DH5α bacterial extracts when monitored under UV light. For overlay assays, crude DH5α bacterial extracts (200 μl) were boiled for 2 min in Laemmli's loading buffer and separated on a denaturing 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Total proteins were either visualized with Red Ponceau or were loaded in duplicate to be visualized by Coomassie staining in addition to the autoradiogram. This half of the gel was transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Fisher, Whitby, Ontario) using Towbin buffer (in mm: 25 Tris, 192 glycine, 20% methanol, and 0.05% SDS). The membrane was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in HBS-Tween (in mm: 137 NaCl, 3 KCl, 10 HEPES, and 0.05% Tween-20 pH 7.4), washed once with HBS-Tween and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 5 ml of HBS-Tween with 20 μl of [35S]methionine labeled CaVβ3- or CaVβ1b subunit prepared as described below. The blots were washed twice for 10 min with 1 mm CaCl2 in HBS-Tween, air-dried, and radioactive signals were detected by autoradiography. [35S]Methionine-labeled CaVβ3 or CaVβ1b in pBluescript (0.5 μg) was synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription and translation (TnT; Promega, Madison, WI) in a 50-μl reaction volume for 1 h, and the reaction mixture was applied without further treatment to the overlay membrane. Functional Expression of Wild-type and Mutants Channels—Oocytes were obtained from female Xenopus laevis clawed frog (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) as described previously (1Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1429-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 34Berrou L. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys.

Briefly, stage VI oocytes free of follicular cells were injected with 46 nl of a solution containing 28 ng of cRNA coding for the wild-type or mutated CaVα1 subunit. The CaVα1 subunit was always co-injected with cRNA coding for the rat brain CaVα2bδ (6Williams M.E. Feldman D.H. McCue A.F. Brenner R. Velicelebi G. Ellis S.B. Harpold M.M. Neuron. 1992; 8: 71-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and with or without the rat brain CaVβ3 (36Castellano A. Wei X. Birnbaumer L. Perez-Reyes E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12359-12366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in a 6:2:3 or 6:2 weight ratio. The final amount of exogenous CaVβ3 injected corresponds to 14 ng, which represents a 23-fold enrichment over the estimated concentration of 0.56 ± 0.02 ng of endogenous CaVβ3xo per oocyte (22Canti C. Davies A. Berrow N.S. Butcher A.J. Page K.M. Dolphin A.C. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1439-1451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 1-5 days after injection in Barth's solution (in mm): 100 NaCl; 2 KCl; 1.8 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; 5 HEPES; 2.5 pyruvic acid; 100 units/ml of penicillin; 50 μg/ml gentamicin; pH 7.6. Electrophysiological Recordings in Oocytes—Wild-type and mutant channels were screened at room temperature for macroscopic Ba2+ currents using a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (OC-725C, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) as described earlier (1Berrou L. Klein H. Bernatchez G. Parent L. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 1429-1442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 4Parent L. Schneider T. Moore C.P. Talwar D. J. Membr.

J. 2001; 80: 215-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In order to minimize series resistance problems associated with voltage clamping large currents in Xenopus oocytes, experiments were performed on cells with peak currents smaller than -5 μA in most cases. Hence, the wild-type channel was recorded 3-4 days after cRNA injection whereas whole cell Ba2+ currents were generally measured 1-2 days after injection for AID mutant channels in the absence of CaVβ3 and 2-3 days in the presence of CaVβ3. Oocytes were first impaled in a modified Ringer solution (in mm): 96 NaOH; 2 KOH; 1.8 CaCl2; 1 MgCl2; 10 HEPES titrated to pH 7.4 with methanesulfonic acid CH3SO3H (MeS), then the bath was perfused with the 10 Ba2+ solution (in mm; 10 Ba(OH)2; 110 NaOH; 1 KOH; 20 Hepes titrated to pH 7.3 with MES). To minimize kinetic contamination by the endogenous Ca2+-activated Cl- current, oocytes were injected with 18.4 nl of a 50 mm EGTA (Sigma) 0.5-1 h before the experiments. Oocytes were superfused by gravity flow at a rate of 2 ml/min that was fast enough to allow complete chamber fluid exchange within 30 s. Experiments were performed at room temperature (20-22 °C). Electrophysiological Data Acquisition and Analysis—PClamp software, Clampex 6.02 and Clampfit 6.02 (Axon instruments, Foster City, CA) was used for on-line data acquisition and analysis as previously described (1Berrou L.

For all recordings, a series of voltage pulses were applied from a holding potential of -80 mV at a frequency of 0.2 Hz from -40 to +60 mV. Isochronal inactivation data (h∞ or hinf) were obtained from tail currents generated at the end of a 5-s prepulse (4Parent L. Schneider T. Moore C.P. Talwar D. J. Membr.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 360: 144-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Tail current amplitudes were estimated using the function Analyze in Clampfit 6.0 from the peak current arising during the first 10 ms after the capacitive transient (20 data points). Each of these currents was then normalized to the maximum current obtained before the prepulse voltage (I/Imax) and was plotted against the prepulse voltage. For the isochronal inactivation figures, IImax=1−1−Y01+{exp−zFRT(Vm−E0.5,inact)} pooled data points (mean ± S.E.) were fitted to Equation 1 using user-defined functions and the fitting algorithms provided by Origin 6.1 and 7.0 (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) analysis software. Equation 1 accounts for the fraction of non-inactivating current with E0.5,inact mid-point potential; z, slope parameter; Y0, fraction of non-inactivating current; Vm, the prepulse potential, and RT/F with their usual meanings. The fitting process generated values estimating errors on the given fit values. Activation potentials were estimated from the normalized I-V curves obtained for each channel combination (22Canti C.

https://openalex.org/W2074726300,"Mammalian NO synthases catalyze the monooxygenation of l-arginine (l-Arg) to N-hydroxyarginine (NOHA) and the subsequent monooxygenation of this to NO and citrulline. Both steps proceed via formation of an oxyferrous heme complex and may ultimately lead to a ferrous NO complex, from which NO must be released. Electrochemical reduction of NO-bound neuronal nitricoxide synthase (nNOS) oxygenase domain was used to form the ferrous heme NO complex, which was found to be stable only in the presence of low NO concentrations, due to catalytic degradation of NO at the nNOS heme site. The reduction potential for the heme-NO complex was approximately –140 mV, which shifted to 0 mV in the presence of either l-Arg or NOHA. This indicates that the complex is stabilized by 14 kJmol–1 in the presence of substrate, consistent with a strong H-bonding interaction between NO and the guanidino group. Neither substrate influenced the reduction potential of the ferrous heme CO complex, however. Both l-Arg and NOHA appear to interact with bound NO in a similar way, indicating that both bind as guanidinium ions. The dissociation constant for NO bound to ferrous heme in the presence of l-Arg was determined electrochemically to be 0.17 nm, and the rate of dissociation was estimated to be 10–4 s–1, which is much slower than the rate of catalysis. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of oxyferrous formation and decay showed that both l-Arg and NOHA also stabilize the ferrous heme dioxy complex, resulting in a 100-fold decrease in its rate of decay. Electron transfer from the active-site cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) has been proposed to trigger the monoxygenation process. Consistent with this, substitution by the analogue/inhibitor 4-amino-H4B stabilized the oxyferrous complex by a further two orders of magnitude. H4B is required, therefore, to break down both the oxyferrousand ferrous nitrosyl complexes of nNOS during catalysis. The energetics of these processes necessitates an electron donor/acceptor operating within a specific reduction potential range, defining the role of H4B.

The active site for NO synthesis is based around Cys-ligated heme, which hydrogen bonds via a propionate group to the H4B cofactor. The substrate, l-arginine (l-Arg), binds above the heme plane by forming a salt bridge with a glutamate residue and is ∼4 Å away from the heme iron (4Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C.

The bound l-Arg initially undergoes monooxygenation to N-hydroxy-l-arginine (NOHA), consuming two electron equivalents and one molecule of dioxygen. During the second step, NOHA remains bound in the enzyme active site and is converted to citrulline and NO in an unusual reaction consuming one electron equivalent and one molecule of dioxygen. The first step is believed to follow a typical P450-type mechanism, in which l-Arg reacts with an oxyferryl heme complex. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the second step, these can involve reaction of the ferrous-dioxy complex with NOHA to form NO• or reaction of the oxyferryl species to generate NO– (14Rosen G.M.

In both cases, H4B free radical formation and decay has been observed, suggesting that the H4B cofactor acts as a single electron donor/acceptor during catalysis. The penultimate species formed in these experiments is the ferric NO complex, from which NO is then released (16Stuehr D.J. Santolini J. Wang Z.Q. Wei C.C. Adak S. J. Biol.

NO has been shown to bind to the ferric enzyme in the absence of substrate and to the ferrous enzyme in the presence of substrate (19Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Given the similarity of the NO and O2 ligands, it is likely that the ferrous dioxygen complex of NOS forms similar O2-substrate interactions prior to oxygen activation. The interactions between substrate and diatomic ligand are therefore important to both the stability of the ferrous nitrosyl complex and to the oxygen activation process, influencing both key catalytic steps and the product inhibition mechanism. In this study, redox potentiometry was used to probe the thermodynamic properties of neuronal NOS heme domain (nNOSoxy) in the presence of the substrates (l-Arg and NOHA) and the diatomic ligands, CO and NO. Stopped-flow spectrophotometry was also used to follow the formation and decay of the ferrous nNOSoxy-dioxygen complex. The two approaches lead to new insights into the roles of substrates and cofactors in the oxygen activation processes leading to NO synthesis. Chemicals and Procedures—All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset) unless otherwise stated. Preparation of nNOS oxygenase domain (nNOSoxy): The nNOSoxy dimer (residues 1–720 with an N-terminal His tag) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 cells also containing the pGroESL plasmid as described previously (8Sagami I. Daff S. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30036-30042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μm H4B (Schircks Lab., Switzerland) 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and a protease inhibitor tablet (Complete, Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged for 40 min at 20,000 × g. The supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column, washed with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 20 μm H4B, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 mm imidazole, and eluted with the same buffer containing 100 mm imidazole. The enzyme fractions were concentrated to 5 ml and eluted through a Sephadex G25 column equilibrated with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, and 20 mm H4B before concentrating to 300 μm and flash freezing in N2(l). To prepare aH4B-bound nNOSoxy, 40 μm 4-amino-H4B (Schircks Laboratory) replaced H4B in the purification buffers. Enzyme samples prepared in this way were >90% pure according to SDS-PAGE and >80% dimeric according to Superdex S200 fast protein liquid chromatography gel filtration (Amersham Biosciences). The concentrations of nNOSoxy were determined optically from the ferrous CO difference spectrum using Δϵ(444–467 nm) = 55 mm–1 cm–1 (24Sagami I. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2105-2108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Optically Transparent Thin Layer Electrochemical Potentiometry— Spectroelectrochemical analysis of nNOSoxy was conducted in an OTTLE cell constructed from a modified quartz EPR cell with a 0.3-mm path length, containing a platinum/Rh (95/5) gauze working electrode, a platinum wire counter electrode, and an argon/AgCl reference electrode (25Ost T.W.B. Clark J. Mowat C.G. Miles C.S. Walkinshaw M.D. Reid G.A. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 15010-15020Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Enzyme samples (0.5 ml × 100–200 μm) were eluted through a G25 column pre-equilibrated with 0.1 m Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 m KCl, 10 μm H4B in an anaerobic glove-box. The mediators, pyocyanine (10 μm), 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone (20 μm), FMN (5 μm), benzyl viologen (10 μm), and methyl viologen (10 μm), were then added. Spectroelectrochemical titrations were performed at 25 ± 2 °C using an Autolab PGSTAT10 potentiostat and a Cary 50 UV-visible spectrophotometer. The argon/AgCl reference electrode employed in the OTTLE cell was calibrated against indigotrisulfonic acid (Em = –99 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode) and FMN (Em = –220 mV versus the standard hydrogen electrode) in the same buffer conditions. All electrode potentials were corrected relative to the standard hydrogen electrode. The potential of the working electrode was decreased in 30-mV steps until the enzyme was fully reduced and increased stepwise until reoxidation was complete. After each step the current and UV-visible absorption spectrum were monitored until no further change occurred. This equilibration process typically lasted 15 min. Absorbance changes were plotted against the potential of the working electrode and analyzed by non-linear regression via the Nernst equation using Origin (MicroCal). For experiments in the presence of CO or NO, the enzyme solution was diluted into a 50% saturated buffer solution of the appropriate gas in the anaerobic chamber immediately prior to use. Pre-steady-state Kinetics—All pre-steady-state measurements were performed at 10 °C using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrophotometer (SX.17MV) contained within an anaerobic glove box (Belle Technology; [O2] < 5 ppm) using either single-wavelength or diode-array detectors (12Craig D.H. Chapman S.K. Daff S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33987-33994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The buffer used was 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing either 10 μm H4B or 50 μm aH4B. l-Arg or NOHA were also added to 10 mm when required. nNOSoxy (∼10 μm) with either H4B or aH4B bound was pre-reduced by addition of 40 μm sodium dithionite. Excess dithionite was removed prior to experimentation by elution through a pre-equilibrated 10 ml of G25 gel-filtration column. Reduction was confirmed by UV-visible spectrometry on a Varian Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer, also contained within the glove-box. Formation of the oxyferrous complex was achieved by mixing the reduced enzyme with buffer containing various concentrations of oxygen. The oxygen concentration was measured by direct reaction with electrochemically generated reduced methyl viologen (ϵ600 = 13,000 m–1cm–1) using a stoichiometry of 4 to 1. Rate constants (kobs) for the formation of the oxyferrous complexes of nNOSoxy were determined by monitoring the absorbance increase at 426 nm with time. The resultant traces (averages of three or more) were fitted to single exponential functions. The values were plotted against oxygen concentration and fitted by linear regression analysis using Origin (MicroCal) to give second order rate constants (gradient) for oxyferrous complex formation (k2nd) and oxygen dissociation (intercept, koff). For the H4B-bound enzyme in the absence of substrate, insufficient absorbance change occurred at 426 nm to enable analysis via this method. Decay of the oxyferrous complex to ferric nNOSoxy was monitored at 390 nm. Again, the resultant traces (averages of three or more) were fitted to single exponential functions. The values at higher oxygen concentrations (above 100 μm) were invariant; these were averaged to give the oxyferrous decay rate constants (kdecay). For the H4B-bound enzyme in the absence of substrate, this was not the case. These values are plotted in Fig. 5A and were fitted to a hyperbolic function giving a saturation rate constant (kdecay) and apparent Km. In this case the second order rate constant (k2nd) was defined by kdecay/Km. Determination of NO Dissociation Constants—nNOSoxy, 1 ml of 0.5 μm in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, containing 10 mml-Arg or NOHA as required was titrated against a saturated solution of NO in an anaerobic glove-box. Changes in the visible absorbance spectrum of the enzyme were monitored as the titration progressed. The concentration of ferric NO complex formed was plotted against NO concentration and fitted using non-linear regression analysis to a single binding-site model to give the Kd. The stock NO concentration was determined by titration with 5 μm P450 BM3 heme domain (26Daff S.N. Chapman S.K. Turner K.L. Holt R.A. Govindaraj S. Poulos T.L. Munro A.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13816-13823Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) in an analogous experiment (Kd < 0.1 mm, i.e. tight binding) using ϵ418 = 108,000 m–1cm–1 for the low spin ferric P450. nNOSoxy Reduction Potentials—Dimeric nNOSoxy purified in the presence of H4B was reduced to the ferrous form and reoxidized within an anaerobic OTTLE cell by stepping the potential of the working electrode in 30-mV increments. After equilibration UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded (Fig. 1B). This was repeated in the presence of l-Arg (Fig. 2B), NOHA, and l-citrulline at 10 mm concentration. For each experiment, the proportion of enzyme reduced, calculated from the change in absorption spectrum, was plotted against the electrode potential and fitted to the Nernst equation to determine the heme reduction potential (Table I and Figs. 1A and 2A). l-Arg and l-citrulline caused a small increase in potential (10 mV), whereas for NOHA this was a more significant 38 mV, indicating that NOHA specifically binds more tightly to the ferrous enzyme than to the ferric by a factor of 4. The potentials are 60 mV more negative than those reported previously (27Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but the shifts observed are in broad agreement.Fig. 1Determination of reduction potentials for nNOSoxy in the absence of substrate.A, proportion of enzyme reduced versus potential for nNOSoxy (•), in the presence of CO () and NOoxy (○), all fitted to the Nernst equation.

The ferrous NO citrulline complex was unstable. Open table in a new tab In the presence of CO, the heme reduction potential was increased by 86 mV, consistent with CO binding solely to the ferrous enzyme. None of the substrates affected this value by a statistically significant amount, indicating that the substrates and bound CO do not interact, despite being in very close proximity within the enzyme's active site. Note that because CO binds only to the ferrous form of the enzyme, the reduction potential is dependent on the concentration of CO (as observed). In these experiments the concentration was ∼0.5 mm, as measured by titration with reduced P450 BM3. Each solution was prepared in the same way using buffer saturated with CO at room temperature and diluted by half, and this led to reproducible results. Determining reproducible reduction potentials in the presence of NO was more problematic. Although NO solutions are known to be stable for days at room temperature in the absence of oxygen, NO can be reduced to NO– at low potential electrodes, or oxidized to nitrite at high potentials (28Bartberger M.D. Liu W.

It is impossible therefore to be sure of the NO concentration within the OTTLE cell. Furthermore, the nitrosyl complexes of nNOSoxy are known to have very different levels of stability. The ferrous nitrosyl complex has been reported to be stable only in the presence of substrate (19Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1994; 91: 10512-10516Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas in the absence of substrate NO was found to bind more tightly to the ferric enzyme. NO was added to the enzyme solution to 50% saturation, as described for CO above. In both the absence and presence of substrate (10 mml-Arg or NOHA) the ferric NO complex formed. In the absence of substrate, as the potential of the working electrode was decreased, increasing levels of current flowed through the solution with no apparent reduction of the enzyme. This behavior was typical in the –50 to –150 mV (versus the standard hydrogen electrode) potential range. Reduction at below –300 mV led to formation of the ferrous enzyme after a prolonged surge of current, in which case all the NO had been consumed. However, stepping the potential slowly in the –50 to –200 mV range led to formation of the substrate-free ferrous nitrosyl complex, which was only stable once all excess NO had been consumed. At fixed potentials of around –200 mV the complex was stable for several hours. At lower potentials the complex reduced to ferrous nNOSoxy, and at higher potentials it was readily oxidized to the ferric enzyme, with the NO ligand being lost in both cases. These events were evident from the distinct UV-visible spectra of the different enzyme species. It appears therefore, that the ferrous NO complex is destroyed by reduction at low potential and that it is oxidized by excess NO at higher potentials. The UV-visible spectrum of substrate-free ferrous nitrosyl nNOSoxy is shown in Fig. 1D and is similar to that of the substrate-bound complex (Fig. 2D). Given the complications, determining the reduction potential of the nNOSoxy NO complex from these experiments is difficult. The data presented in Fig. 1 (A and D) show oxidation of the ferrous nitrosyl complex after formation by reduction at a fixed potential of –280 mV. The ferric enzyme is formed by increasing the potential in five steps of 30 mV with 15-min equilibration between each step. Reductive Nernst curves were also observed in the same range, but only after most of the NO had been depleted, as judged by loss of the spectral signature of the ferric NO complex. Because the system is never fully at equilibrium during reduction/oxidation, the reduction potential of the complex can only be estimated. On the basis of numerous reduction/oxidation experiments, this must be in the range –110 to –170 mV (Table I). In the presence of either substrate (l-Arg or NOHA), the ferric nitrosyl complex was reduced to the ferrous nitrosyl complex at around 0 mV. However, NO was consumed during this process, probably by similar mechanisms observed in the absence of substrate, and reoxidation always resulted in less NO-bound ferric enzyme. Note that NO binds more weakly to the ferric enzyme in the presence of substrate. Once the NO concentration had dropped, however, the electrochemical reduction and oxidation processes were generally reversible, with a steady depletion of the remaining NO being observed. Fig. 2D depicts a typical reduction/oxidation experiment in which the mainly ferric enzyme is converted to the ferrous nitrosyl complex and back. The reduction potentials observed were largely independent of the concentration of NO and are given in Table I. In the presence of citrulline the ferrous nitrosyl complex was unstable, its formation led to irreversible changes to the UV-visible spectrum of the heme, indicative of cofactor modification or loss of the axial ligand. Dissociation Constants for NO—The Kd values for NO binding to ferric nNOSoxy were determined by titrating NO directly into an anaerobic solution of the enzyme at ∼1 μm (Table II). In the absence of substrate NO binds relatively tightly (Kd = 1.9 μm), but binding is weaker in the presence of substrate, as observed previously. l-Arg appears to compete with NO in the active site, but does not exclude the ligand completely. Even at saturation (10 mml-Arg) NO still binds with a Kd of 23 μm. NOHA impedes NO binding to ferric nNOSoxy by a factor of 7 more than l-Arg does. Using the reduction potential shifts observed on NO binding, it is also possible to estimate Kd values for NO with ferrous nNOSoxy. The large reduction potential shifts observed in all cases led to very low values. In the presence of l-Arg, the Kd is 0.17 nm. Even substrate-free nNOSoxy has a Kd value of 4.3 nm indicating very slow rates of NO dissociation from both complexes.Table IIDissociation constants for NO bound to ferric (KdIII) and ferrous (KdII) nNOSoxyKdIIIaaDetermined by direct spectrophotometric titration.KdIIbbCalculated from KdIII and ΔE0.μmnm1.9 ± 0.14.3l-Arg23 ± 20.17NOHA150 ± 302.3a Determined by direct spectrophotometric titration.b Calculated from KdIII and ΔE0.

https://openalex.org/W2047869020,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, oligosaccharyl transferase (OT) consists of nine different subunits. Three of the essential gene products, Ost1p, Wbp1p, and Stt3p, are N-linked glycoproteins. To study the function of the N-glycosylation of these proteins, we prepared single or multiple N-glycosylation site mutations in each of them. We established that the four potential N-glycosylation sites in Ost1p and the two potential N-glycosylation sites in Wbp1p were occupied in the mature proteins. Interestingly, none of the N-glycosylation sites in these two proteins was conserved, and no defect in growth or OT activity was observed when the N-glycosylation sites were mutated to block N-glycosylation in either subunit. However, in the third glycosylated subunit, Stt3p, there are two adjacent potential N-glycosylation sites (N535NTWN539NT) that, in contrast to the other subunits, are highly conserved in eukaryotic organisms. Mass spectrometric analysis of a tryptic digest of Stt3p showed that the peptide containing the two adjacent N-glycosylation sites was N-glycosylated at one site. Furthermore, the glycan chain identified as Man8GlcNAc2 is found linked only to Asn539. Mutation experiments were carried out at these two sites. Four single amino acid mutations blocking either N-glycosylation site (N535Q, T537A, N539Q, and T541A) resulted in strains that were either lethal or extremely temperature sensitive. However, other mutations in the two N-glycosylation sites N535NTWN539NT (N536Q, T537S, N540Q, and T541S), did not exhibit growth defects. Based on these studies, we conclude that N-glycosylation of Stt3p at Asn539 is essential for its function in the OT complex."
https://openalex.org/W2082092698,"Neurogenesis in all animals is triggered by the activity of a group of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, the proneural proteins, whose expression endows ectodermal regions with neural potential. The eventual commitment to a neural precursor fate involves the interplay of these proneural transcriptional activators with a number of other transcription factors that fine tune transcriptional responses at target genes. Most prominent among the factors antagonizing proneural protein activity are the HES basic helix-loop-helix proteins. We have previously shown (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) that two HES proteins of Drosophila, E(spl)mγ and E(spl)m7, interact with the proneural protein Sc and thereby get recruited onto Sc target genes to repress transcription. Using in vivo and in vitro assays we have now discovered an important dual role for the Sc C-terminal domain. On one hand it acts as a transcription activation domain, and on the other it is used to recruit E(spl) proteins. In vivo, the Sc C-terminal domain is required for E(spl) recruitment in an enhancer context-dependent fashion, suggesting that in some enhancers alternative interaction surfaces can be used to recruit E(spl) proteins.

Sc (Scute) and E(spl)m7 (Enhancer of split m7) are two Drosophila bHLH 1The abbreviations used are: bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; TAD, transcriptional activation domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside. transcription factors, characterized by the basic-helix-loop-helix structural motif, which is responsible for dimerization and DNA binding (2Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1392) Google Scholar). This large family of transcription factors contains evolutionarily conserved subfamilies, which participate in a variety of biological processes. Sc belongs to the Class II bHLH proteins, more specifically to the achaetescute branch of the proneural family, which also includes vertebrate Ash proteins (achaete-scute homologues). These proteins play a central role in initiating neural development in all metazoans studied so far (3Bertrand N. Castro D.S. Guillemot F. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 517-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). E(spl)m7, on the other hand, belongs to the HES (Hairy/Enhancer-of-split) family of bHLH proteins, also known as Class VI, which are structurally distinct from the proneural family (4Fisher A. Caudy M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Although their biological effects encompass a great number of processes, one of their roles is to inhibit neurogenesis; in this context they are expressed downstream of a Notch-mediated signaling pathway termed lateral inhibition (5Bray S. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 9: 591-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). HES proteins inhibit neurogenesis by repressing target genes of the proneural proteins or even the expression of proneural genes themselves. Consistent with this biological activity, it has been shown that although proneural proteins are transcriptional activators, HES proteins are repressors. Because of structural differences in their bHLH domains, the two families have distinct target site specificities. Proneural proteins make obligate heterodimers with the ubiquitous bHLH protein Da (Daughterless) and preferentially bind to the so-called EA boxes, CASCTG (6Singson A. Leviten M.W. Bang A.G. Hua X.H. Posakony J.W. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2058-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). HES proteins, on the other hand, homodimerize or heterodimerize among themselves and bind preferably to EB or C boxes, CACGTG and CACGCG, respectively (7Jennings B.H. Tyler D.M. Bray S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4600-4610Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A model for neural commitment proposes that genes initiating this process are targets of both proneural and HES proteins, and the relative activity of these two mutually antagonistic bHLH factors ultimately determines whether a cell will commit to the neural pathway or not. One way through which a gene could be a target of both proneural and HES proteins is by having target sites for both (i.e. both EA and EB/C boxes) in its regulatory regions. This, albeit generally true, is an over-simplification, because it has been appreciated for some time that EB/C boxes are dispensable in some target enhancers (8Culi J. Modolell J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2036-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have recently described a second mechanism through which target genes of proneural proteins can be repressed by HES proteins. This relies on the ability of E(spl) proteins to interact with Sc, detected both in a yeast two-hybrid system (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and in Drosophila tissues (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). E(spl) proteins are thereby recruited onto the Da-Sc heterodimer and repress transcription of target genes, even in the absence of direct DNA-E(spl) binding. We have now characterized the mechanism of interaction between Sc and E(spl)m7 in detail. Interestingly, this interaction does not involve typical HLH-HLH dimerization; rather E(spl)m7 binds to the C-terminal domain of Sc, which we show to be its transactivation domain. Yeast Two-hybrid Assays—Bait cDNAs were PCR-cloned downstream of the LexA gene fragment between the EcoRI (5′) and XhoI (3′) sites of the pEG202-NLS vector (OriGene) (10Fashena S. Serebriiskii I. Golemis E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 14-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primer sequences are available upon request. Preys were also constructed as 5′ EcoRI-3′ XhoI fragments into the pJG4–5 vector. The pEG202 constructs were transformed into yeast strain EGY48 (Mata trp1 his3 ura3 leu2::6LexAop-LEU2); the pJG4–5 ones along with the LexAop-lacZ reporter plasmid pSH1834 (URA3) into strain FT4 (Matα trp1 his3 ura3 leu2) (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After mating, diploids were tested on galactose/raffinose/leucine/X-gal plates. The plates were photographed after 24 h of growth at 30 °C, and the strength of the interaction was qualitatively judged by the extent of the blue color. LexA constructs were excluded from analysis if they were constitutively active or inactive with all preys tested. The preys were selected using the same criteria. GST Pull-downs—For in vitro transcription/translation of sc and E(spl)m7, pBluescript KSII subclones were made of the EcoRI-XhoI inserts from pJG4–5 or pEG202 clones. To generate GST fusion genes, full-length and subfragments of E(spl)m7 were cloned in pGex4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) as EcoRI-XhoI fragments. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21plys (Stratagene). After induction and lysis, soluble fractions were stored at -80 °C, and fusion protein content was estimated by Coomassie Blue staining of a polyacrylamide gel. To detect interactions, 1–5 μg of various GST fusions (equal amounts) were incubated on 30 μl of glutathione-agarose beads and mixed with in vitro translated proteins. The latter were produced using the coupled TnT/T7 reticulocyte lysate transcription/translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine according to the manufacturer's instructions. After incubation at 4 °C for 3–4 h and extensive washing, affinity resin-bound proteins were run on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gel was fixed and treated with Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Biosciences) before imaging on a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging device. Immobilized Oligonucleotide Pull-down—Approximately 100 pmol of biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotide containing an EA box was immobilized on 50 μl of streptavidin-coated magnetic beads (Dynal), according to the manufacturer's instructions. After extensive washes to remove unbound DNA, the beads were blocked in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 2.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1 μg/μl sonicated salmon sperm DNA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. [35S]Methionine (Amersham Biosciences) radiolabeled proteins were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation using the TnT system of Promega and subsequently incubated with the DNA-coated beads at 4 °C in blocking buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by PAGE and autoradiography. Transient Transfection Assays—The reporter gene used in all assays, UAS-tk-luc, contained five tandem UASGAL4 sites fused upstream of a minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) promoter driving the luciferase gene. The UASx5 enhancer was excised from pUAST (11Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as BamHI-HpaI and inserted in SmaI of pGL3tk. For effector protein expression we used the RactHAdh vector, bearing a constitutive Drosophila act5C promoter (12Swevers L. Cherbas L. Cherbas P. Iatrou K. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Ract-m7 is described in Giagtzoglou et al. (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Ract-m7KNEQ was constructed by PCR in vitro mutagenesis, cloned in pGEM-Teasy (Promega), and sequence-verified (mutagenic primer sequences available upon request). Gal4-DBD fusions were constructed as follows: a fragment encoding the Gal4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–147) was released from pBXG1 (13Brown S.A. Weirich C.S. Newton E.M. Kingston R.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) as a HindIII-XbaI fragment and inserted by blunt ligation into SalI of RactHAdh to generate RactGDBD. The Sc coding region, or segments thereof, were released as SmaI-XhoI inserts from their respective pBluescript-KSII clones (see above) and inserted into the SmaI-SalI sites of RactGDBD. The VP16 activation domain was cloned as a filled-in BamHI-XbaI fragment from pBluescript-E(spl)m7-VP16 (14Jiménez G. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4355-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) into RactGDBD/PstI/blunt. S2 cell transfections and luciferase assays were performed as described in Giagtzoglou et al. (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). 1 μg of total DNA was used per 0.5-ml well, of which 0.4 μg were taken by the RactHAdh effector plasmids (topped up by empty vector), the remainder being 0.4 μg of UAS-tk-luc reporter and 0.2 μg of hs-lacZ used for normalization. The averages and standard deviations of experiments repeated at least in triplicate are shown. Fly Transformation and Reporter Assays—The coding regions for Sc1–260 and Sc1–290 were excised from the corresponding pJG4–5 constructs (see above) by EcoRI-XhoI and subcloned into pUAST (11Brand A.H. Perrimon N. Development. 1993; 118: 401-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with EcoRI-XhoI. Fly strains, transgenesis, crosses, and X-gal histochemistry were done as described in Giagtzoglou et al. (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C.

Identification of the Interaction Domains of Sc and E(spl)m7—We used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify the domains of Sc and E(spl)m7 responsible for their interaction (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). E(spl)m7 fragments were fused with the LexA DNA-binding domain (“baits”) and were tested against fusions of Sc fragments to the B42 activation domain (“preys”) (10Fashena S. Serebriiskii I. Golemis E. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 328: 14-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). The full set of combinations tested is shown in Table I. The fulll-ength Sc fusion, B42-Sc1–345, interacted with three of the six LexA-E(spl)m7 fusions, those with the N terminus intact. Conversely the N-terminal two-thirds of E(spl)m7, LexA-E(spl)m71–137, interacted with those Sc preys that had their C terminus intact; the minimal interacting fragment contained only 25 C-terminal Sc amino acids. Based on these data we propose that the major domains mediating the Sc-E(spl)m7 interaction are the N-terminal 80 amino acids of E(spl)m7 and the C-terminal 25–55 amino acids of Sc. An additional weaker interaction between the C terminus of E(spl)m7 (constructs 61–186 and 81–186) with the N-terminal 260 amino acids of Sc was sometimes observed, but this seems to be suppressed when the Sc C terminus is present, namely in the full-length Sc protein (Table I). Because of the weak and inconsistent incidence of this interaction, it was not studied further. The Sc-E(spl)m7 interaction was confirmed by in vitro GST pulldowns; GST fusions carrying the N-terminal domain of E(spl)m7 were able to effectively pull down in vitro translated Sc protein (Fig. 1B).Table IYeast two-hybrid interactions The interactions were qualitatively measured by detection of blue color on X-gal plates 24 h after plating. ++, strong blue color; +, moderate blue; -, white color; NT, not tested. Gro was used as a positive control, because it is known to interact with the C-terminal WRPW tetrapeptide of E(spl) and related proteins (17Paroush Z. Finley R.L.F.J. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). It was fused to the VP16 activation domain, rather than B42 (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Similarly, the functionality of the Sc fusions bearing the bHLH domain was confirmed by a LexA-Da551–710 fusion, which carries the Da bHLH domain known to interact with Sc (30Murre C. McCaw P.S.

To assay recruitment of E(spl)m7 onto a DNA-bound Da-Sc complex, we immobilized a biotinylated EA oligonucleotide onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and incubated it with various in vitro translated proteins. E(spl)m7 alone was unable to bind the EA beads, in agreement with the known target preferences of E(spl) proteins. However, addition of Da and Sc proteins quantitatively pulled down E(spl)m7 (as well as Da and Sc), consistent with formation of a DNA-Da-Sc-E(spl)m7 complex on the EA DNA target (Fig. 1C). The ability to reproduce the Sc-E(spl)m7 interaction in vitro, by both GST and DNA affinity pull-down, suggests that it is likely to be direct. It is noteworthy that this interaction does not involve the bHLH region of Sc. This suggests that a protein-protein contact other than the well characterized amphipathic HLH dimerization is at play here. It is also worth noting that the E(spl)m7 Orange domain, a domain found in all HES family bHLH proteins (16Davis R.L. Turner D.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 8342-8357Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), is dispensable for its interaction with Sc. The C-terminal Domain of Sc Is a Transcription Activation Domain—The interacting domain of Sc contains a C-terminal stretch of 17 amino acids that is conserved among three members of the achaete-scute complex (Sc, Ac, L'sc) and also conserved in their homologues from other species (Fig. 2A). The presence of six acidic residues within this stretch prompted us to investigate the possibility that this region acts as a transcriptional activation domain (TAD). We fused different fragments of Sc to a Gal4 fragment containing the DNA-binding region (Gal4D) and asked whether the resultant chimeras could activate a luciferase reporter driven by five Gal4 consensus binding sites (construct UAS-tk-luc). The assays were done in transiently transfected Drosophila Schneider S2 cells. All Gal4D fusions containing the C-terminal 25 amino acids of Sc activated the reporter gene, with the most active fragment being Sc321–345, which gave up to 68× activation above basal (Fig. 2B). For comparison, Gal4D fusion to the extremely potent viral transactivation domain VP16 gave up to 1270× activation. Sc1–320, Sc164–320, and Sc261–320 fusions did not activate transcription, even though all three were produced at sufficiently high amounts, as judged by the ability of transfected cell extracts to bind a UASGal4 containing oligonucleotide by EMSA (Supplemental Fig. 1). Thus, the C terminus of Sc is a transcription activation domain, most likely the only TAD within Sc. The Sc TAD Is Inhibited by E(spl) Proteins—Because the domain of Sc responsible for interacting with E(spl)m7 is identical to its TAD, we reasoned that inhibition of Sc activity in vivo by E(spl)m7 may be a result of inhibition of this TAD by the Sc-E(spl)m7 interaction. To test this, we used the same transient transfection approach, where we co-expressed E(spl) proteins along with the Gal4D-Sc activators. Both Gal4D-Sc1–345 and Gal4D-Sc321–345 gradually lost their activity, all the way to basal levels, upon co-expression with increasing amounts of E(spl)m7 (Fig. 3A). This effect was specific for the Sc TAD, because Gal4D-VP16 was not repressible by E(spl)m7. The unlikely possibility that E(spl) proteins inhibited the ability of Gal4D-Sc fusions to bind DNA was eliminated by testing transfected cell extracts for their ability to bind to a UASGal4-containing oligonucleotide by EMSA (Supplemental Fig. 1). Another possibility that we eliminated was that repression was due to spurious binding of E(spl)m7 onto the UAS-tk-luc reporter. For this we made use of E(spl)m7KNEQ, a double point mutation in the basic domain, which abolishes DNA binding in vitro and in vivo but does not affect binding to Sc (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P.

Biol. 1997; 17: 4355-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This mutant E(spl)m7 represses Gal4D-ScTAD-driven transcription as effectively as wild type E(spl)m7 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, wild type E(spl)mδ, an E(spl) protein with intact basic domain but unable to interact with Sc (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), gave very weak repression of transcription driven by Gal4D-Sc-TAD (Fig. 3A). We asked whether the remaining five E(spl) proteins were capable of repressing Gal4D-Sc-driven activation. The three Sc interactors, E(spl)mγ, E(spl)mβ, and E(spl)m3, gave strong repression, similar to E(spl)m7 (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, E(spl)m5 and E(spl)m8, which, like E(spl)mδ, did not exhibit any interaction with Sc in the yeast two-hybrid assay (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), gave weak or no repression of Gal4D-Sc (Fig. 3B). All E(spl) were detectable in transfected cell extracts by Western blot (Supplemental Fig. 2), eliminating the trivial possibility that some tested negative because of lack of expression. We have also used the same constructs in S2 transfection assays in the past (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), 2P. Alifragis and C. Delidakis, unpublished data. where all were equally effective at repressing a luciferase reporter driven by the 5′-proximal ac cis-regulatory region, which contains an E(spl)-binding site. The effect observed here is consistent with a mechanism whereby DNA-bound Gal4D-Sc recruits an E(spl) repressor via protein-protein interaction. To confirm this, we transfected S2 cells with a chimeric E(spl)m7-VP16 construct, in which the C-terminal repression domain of E(spl)m7 is replaced with the strong VP16 TAD, thereby converting E(spl)m7 into an activator (14Jiménez G. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4355-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We obtained UAS-tk-luc reporter gene activation in a fashion strictly dependent on the presence of a Gal4D-Sc fusion with an intact C-terminal TAD (Fig. 3C), consistent with E(spl)m7-VP16 becoming recruited onto the reporter via protein-protein interaction with the Sc TAD. E(spl) proteins recruit the co-repressor Groucho (Gro) via their C-terminal domain, a process that has been shown to be necessary for their functions in vivo (17Paroush Z. Finley R.L.F.J. Kidd T. Wainwright S.M. Ingham P.W. Brent R. Ish-Horowicz D. Cell. 1994; 79: 805-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 18Fisher A.L. Ohsako S. Caudy M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2670-2677Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We asked whether recruitment of Gro is necessary for the observed repression of the Sc TAD by E(spl) proteins in the present S2 assay. Truncation of the C-terminal tryptophan residue of E(spl)m7 to generate E(spl)m7ΔW abolishes its ability to interact with Groucho (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that this mutant is inactive in transgenic flies, because it was unable to suppress neurogenesis and also unable to repress a Sc-driven reporter gene (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Similarly, when tested against Gal4D-Sc1–345, E(spl)m7ΔW was unable to repress the UAS-tk-luc reporter (Fig. 4). However, in the present minimal system E(spl)m7ΔW partially repressed Gal4D-Sc321–345, a fact suggesting that the interaction between the Sc TAD and E(spl)m7 can in itself partially mask the activity of the former. Even in this case, recruitment of Gro enhances repression significantly (cf. E(spl)wt versus E(spl)ΔW on Gal4D-Sc321–345 in Fig. 4). TAD-less Versions of Sc Are Defective in Recruiting E(spl)m7 in Vivo—The domain dissection experiments described above established that the C-terminal TAD of Sc is targeted by E(spl) proteins and thereby inhibited from activating transcription. However, in vivo Sc does not act in isolation, it rather heterodimerizes with Da, which could provide an alternative TAD (19Quong M.W. Massari M.E. Zwart R. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 792-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) as well as an alternative E(spl) interaction domain (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To address the role of the Sc TAD in an in vivo context, we used a transgenic reporter system (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). EE4-lacZ is an artificial reporter driving expression off a tandem multimer of EA boxes (8Culi J. Modolell J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2036-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Both endogenously expressed Sc and that provided by a UAS-sc transgene can heterodimerize with ubiquitous endogenous Da to activate EE4-lacZ. We constructed two C-terminal truncations of a UAS-sc transgene; these terminate at amino acid 260 or 290, and thus lack the TAD, but have an intact bHLH domain. When expressed in the thorax, both Sc1–260 and Sc1–290 elicited significantly weaker activation of EE4-lacZ than Sc (full-length) (Fig. 5, A–C; ectopic expression within the region boxed in Fig. 5B), likely because of the removal of the Sc TAD. The fact that weak activation was observed is consistent with residual TAD activity from the Da molecules recruited onto the reporter via truncated Sc. Recruitment of E(spl)m7 was assayed in the same system by co-expressing a UAS-sc transgene with UAS-E(spl)m7KNEQ-VP16 (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Jiménez G. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4355-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The latter is an E(spl)m7 transgene bearing two modifications: 1) a replacement of the C-terminal repression domain with the VP16 TAD, as described above, and 2) the basic domain inactivating KNEQ double point mutation (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 14Jiménez G. Ish-Horowicz D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4355-4362Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of these modifications transcriptional activation by this effector transgene depends on the existence of a DNA-bound transcription factor to recruit it to the enhancer under study. Indeed, when expressed alone, E(spl)m7KNEQ-VP16 produces strong transcriptional activation of EE4-lacZ only in proneural clusters, where endogenous sc is expressed (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (see also Fig. 5D, arrows). When co-expressed with UAS-sc (fulll-ength) very strong ubiquitous activation ensues (Fig. 5, E and H), suggesting effective recruitment by the now ubiquitous Da-Sc complex. In contrast, UAS-sc1–260 results in very slight (Fig. 5F) or no (Fig. 5I) activation when co-expressed with E(spl)m7KNEQ-VP16, suggesting that the latter cannot be efficiently recruited onto EE4-lacZ by the Da-Sc1–260 complex. This was further confirmed by co-expressing the truncated versions of Sc with an unmodified E(spl)m7. The weak activation elicited by either Sc1–260 or Sc1–290 was not repressible by E(spl)m7 (Supplemental Fig. 3), in sharp contrast to the strong repression seen when wild type Sc is co-expressed with E(spl)m7 (1Giagtzoglou N. Alifragis P. Koumbanakis K.A. Delidakis C. Development. 2003; 130: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We tested the same combinations of effector transgenes on a different reporter gene, ac-lacZ, driven by a promoter proximal 5′ regulatory fragment of ac. This contains binding sites for a number of transcription factors, including Da-Sc, E(spl), and Sens (15Martinez C. Modolell J. Garrell J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3514-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 20Jafar-Nejad H. Acar M. Nolo R. Lacin H. Pan H. Parkhurst S.M. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2966-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and is expressed in a proneural cluster pattern (Fig. 5J). Unlike EE4-lacZ, both UAS-sc and UAS-sc1–260 can substantially activate ac-lacZ ectopically (Fig. 5, K and L), suggesting that in this enhancer context the presence of the Sc TAD is dispensable. We then assayed E(spl)m7KNEQ-VP16 recruitment using the same strategy as the one used for EE4-lacZ. Fig. 5 (M–O) shows that this E(spl)m7 chimera produces equivalent reporter activation when co-expressed with either Sc or Sc1–260, suggesting that also in E(spl)m7 recruitment the Sc TAD is rendered dispensable in the ac-lacZ reporter context. The Sc TAD and Other Interaction Partners of E(spl) Proteins—The fact that proneural and E(spl) bHLH proteins have mutually antagonistic activities has long been accepted (4Fisher A. Caudy M. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 298-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Here we describe for the first time a molecular basis for this antagonism of the Sc-E(spl)m7 pair, which relies on the ability of the latter to interact and inhibit the activity of the TAD of the former. We have dissected Sc and E(spl)m7 and in the process have identified 1) the TAD of Sc, which resides in its 25 C-terminal amino acids, 2) the E(spl)m7 interaction domain of Sc, which is identical to or overlaps with its above mentioned TAD, and 3) the Sc interaction domain of E(spl)m7, which is contained within the N-terminal 80 amino acids. Three more of the seven E(spl) proteins, E(spl)mγ, E(spl)mβ, and E(spl)m3, share the ability E(spl)m7 to inhibit the Sc TAD, consistent with an increased structural similarity among these four E(spl) proteins. To address a possible in vivo role for this interaction between Sc and E(spl) proteins, we have to take some points into consideration. Natural enhancers recruit a number of transcription factors and co-factors to assemble an enhanceosome (21Merika M. Thanos D. Curr. Op. Genet. Devel. 2001; 11: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), which regulates transcription initiation. For example, Da-Sc target enhancers may variably contain additional activators, such as a putative NFκB-like α-factor (8Culi J. Modolell J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2036-2047Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), Sens (20Jafar-Nejad H. Acar M. Nolo R. Lacin H. Pan H. Parkhurst S.M. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2966-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 22Nolo R. Abbott L.A. Bellen H.J. Cell. 2000; 102: 349-362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), or Sis-a (23Erickson J.W. Cline T.W. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1688-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). While affording robustness in gene regulation, the multifactorial nature of the enhanceosome and its ability to assemble itself using multiple alternative macromolecular interactions may cause frustration to the researcher trying to dissect out the function of individual components. Artificial enhancers, on the other hand, can reveal functions of individual domains, because they rely on a small number of transcription factors because of the very simplicity of their design. Using the artificial enhancers UAS-tk-luc and EE4-lacZ, we showed that the Sc C terminus is necessary for both transcriptional activation and recruitment of E(spl) proteins. Already, when assayed on a more complex natural enhancer, ac-lacZ (Fig. 5, J–O), the role of the Sc C terminus starts becoming blurry. Equally good activation and E(spl)m7KNEQ-VP16 recruitment appears to take place whether the Sc C terminus is present or not. We attribute this to the presence of alternative TADs and alternative contact surfaces that are able to recruit E(spl)m7 onto this enhanceosome but not onto the simpler EE4-lacZ. Other than Sc, transcription factors that have been reported in the literature to interact with E(spl)m7 are Da (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and Sens (20Jafar-Nejad H. Acar M. Nolo R. Lacin H. Pan H. Parkhurst S.M. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2966-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the presence of Da (predicted to bind on EE4-lacZ) can only weakly sustain transcription and E(spl)m7 recruitment in the absence of Sc TAD (Fig. 5, C, F, and I), the presence of Sens or some other yet-to-be-identified E(spl) interaction surface on the ac-lacZ appears to render the Sc TAD dispensable in the assays of Fig. 5 (J–O). It is noteworthy that E(spl) use different domains to contact Sc (the N-terminal region; this work) versus Sens (the middle Orange region (20Jafar-Nejad H. Acar M. Nolo R. Lacin H. Pan H. Parkhurst S.M. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2966-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)). The existence of more than one protein-protein interaction domain on any given factor is likely to be advantageous in complex formation. Establishing contacts via both the N terminus and the Orange domain would likely result in cooperative recruitment, allowing an E(spl) protein to repress a Sc+Sens-containing enhanceosome more effectively. Further functional characterization of the E(spl) proteins will determine the relative contribution of each documented (or yet-to-be documented) protein-protein interaction, as well as of direct DNA binding, to recruitment onto target genes. Conservation of the Sc Activation Domain and Its Implications—The C terminus of Sc is conserved in other Sc family proneural proteins in Drosophila (Ac and L'sc), as well as homologues from other phyla (Fig. 2A), which in itself argues for some important function. Its role had been overlooked so far; in fact an earlier report had proposed that it is dispensable for the proneural activity of Lethal of Scute (L'sc) (24Hinz U. Giebel B. Campos-Ortega J.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 77-87Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). In that work, a transgene essentially consisting of only the bHLH domain of L'sc (l'scΔNΔC) was able to promote ectopic sensory organ (bristle) production, only slightly more weakly than full-length L'sc. Because that transgene was not tested against specific reporter genes such as the ones we used here, we should be cautious in drawing conclusions about the function of the L'sc C terminus for the reasons described above. Namely, bristle production is the outcome of the activation of a (still ill-defined) number of Sc (L'sc) target genes driven by complex enhancers and multiple factors, the presence of which might compensate for the lack of the L'sc C-terminal domain. So, in a transgenic assay, the presence of the Sc (or L'sc) TAD may be dispensable, whereas its bHLH domain is sufficient to recruit Da to the bristle-promoting target genes to nucleate the assembly of complex enhanceosomes. Indeed the behavior of our C-terminally truncated transgenes sc1–260 and sc1–290 is entirely consistent with that of l'scΔNΔC. Adult flies expressing the UAS-sc transgene have approximately the same number of ectopic bristles as those expressing UAS-sc1–260 or UAS-sc1–290 (data not shown). These very same genotypes, however, display a dramatic difference in the activation of the EE4-lacZ reporter (Fig. 5, B and C). Does phylogenetic conservation of the C terminus imply that both functions, TAD and HES repressor recruitment, have also been conserved? We have preliminary data to suggest that at least the TAD function has been conserved in Mash1. 3I. Zarifi and C. Delidakis, unpublished observations. Additionally, some evidence exists in the literature, consistent with protein interaction-mediated antagonism between Mash1 and HES1. Castella et al. (25Castella P. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) showed that Mash1 promotes and HES1 inhibits neuronal differentiation of rat hippocampal neural precursors in culture. Importantly, transfection of Mash1 together with HES1 also inhibited neuronal differentiation, suggesting that HES1 antagonizes Mash1 post-translationally. In a reporter assay (26Sasai Y. Kageyama R. Tagawa Y. Shigemoto R. Nakanishi S. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2620-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar), this ability of HES1 to antagonize Mash1 was retained by a basic region mutant of HES1 (25Castella P. Wagner J.A. Caudy M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 56: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This would be consistent with HES1 interacting with the TAD of Mash1 to block its activity, independently of the ability of HES1 to bind DNA. Further dissection of these and related vertebrate bHLH proteins will reveal the extent to which the present documented mechanism has been conserved through evolution. Another interesting question raised by our work regards the remaining proneural proteins. The second subclass of proneural proteins, the Ato/Ngn subclass, is equally important in neural precursor commitment (27Quan X-J. Denayer T. Yan J. Jafar-Nejad H. Philippi A. Lichtarge O. Vleminckx K. Hassan B.A. Development. 2004; 131: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) but has a bHLH domain different from that of the achaete-scute proteins and, most importantly for the present discussion, lacks the conserved C-terminal TAD (28Hassan B.A. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1852-1865PubMed Google Scholar). In fact the TADs of Ato/Ngn proteins remain to be identified. It will be interesting to determine whether the Ato/Ngn TADs have also evolved to be inhibited by HES proteins. Our preliminary analysis has shown that Ato can interact with two E(spl) proteins in yeast two-hybrid (9Alifragis P. Poortinga G. Parkhurst S.M. Delidakis C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13099-13104Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), so an analogous mechanism for this proneural subclass is conceivable.

https://openalex.org/W2103311340,"7-Hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) is a protein kinase inhibitor anticancer drug currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial. The low distribution volumes and systemic clearance of UCN-01 in human patients have been found to be caused in part by its extraordinarily high affinity binding to human α1-acid glycoprotein (hAGP). In the present study, we photolabeled hAGP with [3H]UCN-01 without further chemical modification. The photolabeling specificity of [3H]UCN-01 was confirmed by findings in which other hAGP binding ligands inhibited formation of covalent bonds between hAGP and [3H]UCN-01. The amino acid sequence of the photolabeled peptide was concluded to be SDVVYTDXK, corresponding to residues Ser-153 to Lys-161 of hAGP. No PTH derivatives were detected at the 8th cycle, which corresponded to the 160th Trp residue. This strongly implies that Trp-160 was photolabeled by [3H]UCN-01. Three recombinant hAGP mutants (W25A, W122A, and W160A) and wild-type recombinant hAGP were photolabeled by [3H]UCN-01. Only mutant W160A showed a marked decrease in the extent of photoincorporation. These results strongly suggest that Trp-160 plays a prominent role in the high affinity binding of [3H]UCN-01 to hAGP. A docking model of UCN-01 and hAGP around Trp-160 provided further details of the binding site topology. 7-Hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) is a protein kinase inhibitor anticancer drug currently undergoing a phase II clinical trial.

Nimerg R.B. Kimura A. Yamaguchi H. Binette J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 492: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). It contains sialic acids, which cause it to be negatively charged (pI = 2.7∼3.2) (2Kremer J.M. Wilting J. Janssen L.H. Pharmacol. Rev. 1988; 40: 1-47PubMed Google Scholar). Its glycosylation pattern can change depending on the type of inflammation (3Van Dijk W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 376: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The biological function of hAGP is not clear, although studies using in vivo models of inflammation indicate that it plays anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating roles and has protective effects (4Hochepied T. Berger F.G. Baumann H. Libert C. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2003; 14: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 5Cheresh D.A. Haynes D.H. Distasio J.A. Immunology. 1984; 51: 541-548PubMed Google Scholar). The “basal” level of hAGP is ∼20 μmol/liter, but hAGP levels can increase by 5-10-fold in response to stress, infection, or an inflammatory response to neoplasm (6Morita K. Yamaji A. Ther. Drug Monit. 1995; 17: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 7Mackiewicz A. Mackiewicz K. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In addition to increases in hAGP plasma concentration in certain cancers, changes in the expression of genetic variants of hAGP can occur according to the specific type of cancer (8Duche J.C. Urien S. Simon N. Malaurie E. Monnet I. Barre J. Clin. Biochem. 2000; 33: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The levels of hAGP vary widely and heterogeneously among cancer patients; according to the type of disease, the composition of hAGP consists of various isoforms and degrees of glycosylation (9Fan C. Stendahl U. Stjernberg N. Beckman L. Oncology. 1995; 52: 498-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that increases in circulating hAGP alter the pharmacokinetic disposition and pharmacological action of numerous drugs that bind to it (10Mazoit J.X. Dalens B.J. Clin. Pharmacokinet. 2004; 43: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 11Veering B.T. Burm A.G. Feyen H.M. Olieman W.M. Souverijn J.H. Van Kleef J.W. Anesthesiology. 2002; 96: 1062-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 12Hedaya M.A. Daoud S.S. Anticancer Res. 2001; 21: 4005-4010PubMed Google Scholar). For example, increased hAGP levels associated with advanced tumors alter the pharmacokinetics of Imatinib (STI571), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in leukemia patients (13Gambacorti-Passerini C. Zucchetti M. Russo D. Frapolli R. Verga M. Bungaro S. Tornaghi L. Rossi F. Pioltelli P. Pogliani E. Alberti D. Corneo G. D'Incalci M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 625-632PubMed Google Scholar). hAGP also appears to be an independent predictor of response and a major objective prognostic factor of survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer treated with docetaxel chemotherapy (14Bruno R. Olivares R. Berille J. Chaikin P. Vivier N. Hammershaimb L. Rhodes G.R. Rigas J.R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 1077-1082PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, hAGP is an important modulator of drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in anticancer therapeutics. 7-Hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) has an indolocarbazole moiety and was originally isolated as a selective inhibitor of a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C (PKC)) (15Takahashi I. Kobayashi E. Asano K. Yoshida M. Nakano H. J. Antibiot (Tokyo). 1987; 40: 1782-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). UCN-01 is a derivative of staurosporine, which occurs naturally, inhibits numerous other kinases, and has greater selectivity for PKC than does staurosporine (16Penuelas S. Alemany C. Noe V.

UCN-01 can mediate 3 distinct cellular effects in vitro: cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, and potentiation of DNA damage-related toxicity (18Facchinetti M.M. Siervi DeA. Toskos D.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 6609-6620Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Unlike other compounds with an indolocarbazole moiety, UCN-01 preferentially induces G1 phase accumulation in various cell lines, and one of its mechanisms of action is clearly mediated by dephosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), an intracellular retinoblastoma protein kinase that regulates the transition from the G1 to S phase (25Akiyama T. Yoshida T. Tsujita T. Shimizu M. Mizukami T. Okabe M. Akinaga S. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1495-1501PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, UCN-01 enhances the anticancer effects of several important chemotherapeutic drugs, including mitomycin C, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil, in vitro and in vivo (26Akinaga S. Nomura K. Gomi K. Okabe M. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1993; 32: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 27Abe S. Kubota T. Otani Y. Furukawa T. Watanabe M. Kumai K. Kitajima M. Jpn. J.

UCN-01 is currently in the phase II study of its effects on relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell and mature T-cell lymphomas (29Sausville E.A. Arbuck S.G. Messmann R. Headlee D. Bauer K.S. Lush R.M. Murgo A. Figg W.D. Lahusen T. Jaken S. Jing X. Roberge M. Fuse E. Kuwabara T. Senderowicz A.M. J. Clin.

UCN-01 was initially administered as a 72-h continuous infusion every 2 weeks, based on data from in vitro and xenograft preclinical models. However, in the first few patients, the drug had an unexpectedly long half-life (>30 days), which was 100 times longer than the half-life observed in preclinical models. The distribution volumes (0.0796∼0.158 liter/kg) and systemic clearance (0.0407∼0.252 ml/h/kg) in the human patients were found to be extremely low. This pharmacokinetic behavior of UCN-01 in humans can partly be attributed to its specific high affinity binding to hAGP, which causes slow dissociation of UCN-01 from hAGP and thereby limits its disposition and elimination (31Fuse E. Tanii H. Takai K. Asanome K. Kurata N. Kobayashi H. Kuwabara T. Kobayashi S. Sugiyama Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1054-1060PubMed Google Scholar, 32Fuse E. Tanii H. Kurata N. Kobayashi H. Shimada Y.

The binding constant for UCN-01 and hAGP, 8 × 108m-1, is the highest value ever reported for protein binding studies (33Sausville E.A. Lush R.D. Headlee D. Smith A.C. Figg W.D. Arbuck S.G. Senderowicz A.M. Fuse E. Tanii H. Kuwabara T. Kobayashi S. Cancer Chemother. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 54-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Several protein binding studies of hAGP had been conducted using a variety of techniques including equilibrium dialysis, ultrafiltration, chemical modification, and displacement (34Bailey D.N. Briggs J.R. Ther. Drug Monit. 2004; 26: 40-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 35Nakai D. Kumamoto K. Sakikawa C. Kosaka T. Tokui T. J. Pharm.

In a recent study, we identified the key factors contributing to the unusually high binding affinity between UCN-01 and hAGP: the substituent at C-7 of the UCN-01 molecule, and the Trp residues of hAGP (38Katsuki M. Chuang V.T.G. Nishi K. Suenaga A. Otagiri M. Pharm. Res. 2004; 21: 1648-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Crystallographic structural analysis has become more common and appears to be a good method for analysis of ligand-protein interaction, but there have been no reports of crystallographic structural analysis of hAGP. Certain experimental techniques allow direct evaluation of ligand-protein complexes, which can elucidate the binding chemistry of hAGP. Photoaffinity labeling is an essential complement to modeling and mutagenesis and allows direct, unambiguous identification of the contact region between a binding protein and its specific photoactivatable ligands (39Hatanaka Y. Sadakane Y. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 40Chang S.H. Low P.S. J. Biol.

There is no photoaffinity labeling study that has led to the direct determination of labeled amino acid residues in hAGP. In the present study, we used [3H]UCN-01 (Fig. 1) as a photoaffinity labeling agent to characterize the binding site of hAGP. Also, single residue mutants of recombinant hAGP (W25A, W122A, and W160A) were produced in order to determine which Trp was involved in the high affinity binding of [3H]UCN-01. Finally, we constructed models of the docking of UCN-01 into the binding cavity, using a three-dimensional molecular model of hAGP. Materials—[3H]UCN-01 (12 Ci/mmol), UCN-01, UCN-02, and staurosporine were supplied by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo Co. (Shizuoka, Japan). hAGP (purified from cohn fraction VI) was purchased from Sigma. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was purchased from Promega. All other chemicals and solvents were of analytical grade. N-Glycosidase F recombinant (PNGase F) was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Plasma-derived AGP (pAGP), propranolol, and progesterone were purchased from Sigma. Potassium warfarin was donated by Eisai Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Restriction enzymes, Escherichia coli JM109, the DNA ligation kit, and the DNA polymerase Premix Taq® (EX Taq version) were obtained from Takara Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). The DNA sequencing kit was obtained from PerkinElmer Applied Biosystems (Tokyo, Japan). The Pichia expression kit was purchased from Invitrogen. DEAE Sephacel, phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow, and Sephadex G-75 superfine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Expression and Purification of Wild-type and Mutant rhAGP—Re-combinant hAGP (rhAGP) was expressed in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris using the expression vector pPIC9, and was purified by anionic exchange, hydrophobic interaction, and gel filtration chromatography (42Nishi K. Fukunaga N. Otagiri M. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The single residue mutants W25A, W122A, and W160A were prepared using a QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit, following the procedure of Braman et al. (43Braman J. Papworth C. Greener A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1996; 57: 31-44PubMed Google Scholar). Purification of rhAGP—The growth medium was separated from the yeast by centrifugation (6000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the secreted rhAGP was isolated from the medium as follows. The medium was brought to 60% saturation with ammonium sulfate at room temperature. The temperature was then lowered to 4 °C, and the pH was adjusted to 4.0. After shaking for 12 h, the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C) and resuspended in distilled water. Dialysis was performed for 48 h at 4 °C against 100 volumes of distilled water, followed by a further 24 h of dialysis against 100 volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). Then, the solution was loaded onto a column of DEAE Sephacel. rhAGP was eluted with a linear gradient of 0-1 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The eluted rhAGP was loaded onto a column of phenyl-Sepharose Fast Flow. Finally, rhAGP was purified using Sephadex G-75 superfine resin. Photoaffinity Labeling of hAGP—hAGP (50 μm) was incubated with [3H]UCN-01 (0.08 μm) in 100 μl of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) in a 1.5-ml Eppendorf tube at room temperature in the dark for 60 min. The incubation mixture was then placed on ice and irradiated for 30 min by a 100-watt black light/blue lamp (310 nm, Ultra-Violet Products, Inc., San Gabriel, CA) at a distance of 10 cm. After irradiation, the photolabeled hAGP was precipitated by adding 1 ml of acetone, followed by centrifugation at 15 × 1000 rpm for 10 min. The pellet was washed with 1 ml of ethanol and centrifuged a second time. SDS-PAGE and Electroblotting—Photolabeled hAGP was analyzed by SDS-PAGE using a 10% polyacrylamide gel (according to the method of Laemmli) and a sampling buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1% (w/v) SDS, 20 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm EDTA, and 2% (w/v) sucrose). The concentration of protein was determined by Bradford assay using bovine serum albumin as the standard (44Zor T. Selinger Z. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDF membrane in a transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 193 mm glycine, 10% methanol) using a semidry blotting assembly. The blotted membrane was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, followed by complete drying in air. Autoradiograpic Analysis—For autoradiographic analysis, the dried PVDF membrane was placed in contact with an imaging plate (BAS III, Fuji Photo Film Co.) in a cassette (BAS cassette 2040) at room temperature for 48 h. The imaging plate was scanned and analyzed using a Bio-Imaging Analyzer (model BAS FLA-3000 G; Fuji Photo Film Co.), and was then analyzed using L Process V1.6 software (Fuji Film Science Lab 98). The incorporation of radioactivity into individual fragments was quantified using Image Gauge V3.1 software (Fuji Film). Competition Experiments—In order to determine the photolabeling specificity of the binding site of [3H]UCN-01, hAGP (50 μm) was incubated with [3H]UCN-01 (0.08 μm) in the presence of competitors (250 μm) prior to photolysis. The competitors were the UCN-01 analogues staurosporine and UCN-02, the basic drug propranolol, the acidic drug warfarin, and progesterone (representative steroid hormone). The photolabeled hAGP was separated by 10% gel SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto a PVDF membrane before being subjected to autoradiographic analysis. Reductive Pyridylethylation and Deglycosylation of hAGP—After the photolabeled hAGP was precipitated by acetone, 100 μl of the buffer was added to the precipitate. Then, 10 μl of 1% SDS and 1 m 2-mercaptoethanol were added to this solution, followed by reduction at 100 °C at 10 min. For deglycosylation of hAGP, 10 μl of 10% n-octanoyl-N-methyglucamide (MEGA-8), 50 μl of deionized water and 2 units of PNGase F were added to the reduction solution, and the resulting solution was incubated for 24 h. Then, 1 μl of 4-vinylpyridine was added, the mixture was further incubated in a N2 atmosphere for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, and was then dialyzed for desalination. Tryptic Digestion and Purification of Photolabeled hAGP Peptide Fragments—Tryptic digestion was performed in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8). After deglycosylation, deglycosylated hAGP was incubated with trypsin for 5 h at 37 °C. The ratio of trypsin to hAGP was 1:20 (w/w). Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 × 250 mm, Vydac) high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an aqueous acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The separated peptides were fractionated every 30 s; 200 μl of each fraction were added to 2.5 ml of scintillation mixture; and the radioactivity was determined using a LSC-500 liquid scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). The fraction with the highest radioactivity was collected in an Eppendorf tube, and was evaporated on a SpeedVac evaporator until the volume of the sample was about 50 μl. Capillary HPLC Separation and Sequencing—After evaporation, 10 μl of the sample was injected into an ABI 173 A MicroBlotter Capillary HPLC System (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (45Davis M.T. Lee T.D. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 935-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The sample was manipulated according to the manufacturer's instructions (User's Manual, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Meanwhile, the blotted membrane from the capillary HPLC separation using a C18 column (5 μm, 1.5 × 150 mm, PerkinElmer) was in contact with an imaging plate for 48 h prior to autoradiography analysis. The PVDF membrane was aligned with the chromatogram of a peptide map from the ABI 173 A MicroBlotter Capillary HPLC System. Portions of the PVDF membrane were excised for sequencing on an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer with reference to the autoradiogram. Docking of UCN-01 to hAGP—The structure of hAGP has not previously been experimentally determined. As a model of the three-dimensional structure of hAGP for ligand docking, we used the modeled structure of hAGP obtained by Kopecky et al. (46Kopecky Jr., V Ettrich R. Hofbauerova K. Baumruk V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The initial structure of UCN-01 was taken from the crystal structure of the Chk1·UCN-01 complex (47Zhao B. Bower M.J. McDevitt P.J. Zhao H. Davis S.T. Johanson K.O. Green S.M. Concha N.O. Zhou B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46609-46615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, PDB ID 1NVQ). The docking calculation of UCN-01 to hAGP was performed using the SYBYL FlexX (48Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar) under the condition that UCN-01 interacts with Trp-160. During the docking calculation, the structure of hAGP and the ring conformation of UCN-01 were kept rigid. The docking algorithm produced 158 different placements of UCN-01 in hAGP. All placements were evaluated by SYBYL CScore and were then ranked using AASS (Average of Auto-Scaled Scores), as follows in Equation 1. AASSplacement=(∑tiScoreplacement−min(iScore)max(iScore)−min(iScore))/n(Eq. 1) In the AASS calculation, n = 5 and i = F_Score (48Rarey M. Kramer B. Lengauer T. Klebe G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 470-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2307) Google Scholar), G_Score (49Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol.

Design. 1997; 11: 425-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). Although the top 5 placements had nearly the same AASS values, they were classified into two types of binding modes. For each type, we chose the placement with the best AASS value as the candidate binding mode. In the type I model, UCN-01 is bound to a hydrophobic pocket formed by Val-41, Ile-44, Phe-48, and Val-156. In the type II model, UCN-01 is packed into a hydrophobic pocket consisting of Ile-28, Pro-131, Leu-138, Tyr-157, and Trp-160. Refinement of Docking Models—To refine the docking models, the coordinates of the atoms of UCN-01 and the atoms of hAGP within 10 Å from UCN-01 were optimized to reduce the root mean square of the gradients of potential energy below 0.05 kcal mol-1 Å-1 using SYBYL 6.9.1 (Tripos, Inc., 2003). The Tripos force field was used for the molecular energy calculation. The AMBER 7 charges (53Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11373) Google Scholar) were used as the atomic charges for hAGP. The Gasteiger-Hückel charges (54Gasteiger J.

The distance-dependent dielectric constant of 4r was used. Due to the lack of hydrogen atoms in the modeled structure of hAGP, the initial positions of the hydrogen atoms in the hAGP were generated by the SYBYL. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis of differences was performed by one-way ANOVA followed by the modified Fisher's least squares difference method. Photolabeling of [3H]UCN-01 to hAGP—The autoradiogram in Fig. 2 shows that the band of radiolabeled protein appeared only upon the photoirradiation of hAGP with [3H]UCN-01. The radioactivity band indicated the incorporation of [3H]UCN-01 to hAGP via photoirradiation. No band of radiolabeled protein could be observed for the sample without irradiation indicating that no covalent attachment of [3H]UCN-01 to hAGP occurred in the dark. Exposure to light for 30 min was sufficient for the photoincorporation of [3H]UCN-01 to hAGP (Fig. 3). The results indicate that [3H]UCN-01 is photoactivatable and stable in the dark.Fig. 3Time course of [3H]UCN-01 photoincorporation. 50 μm hAGP was incubated with 0.08 μm [3H]UCN-01 for 60 min prior to photoirradiation. Aliquots of 100 μl were taken from the mixture solution at each time point as stated in the figure during irradiation until 30 min. All samples were separated with 10% SDS-PAGE and electro-blotted onto a PVDF membrane for autoradiographic analysis.

Matsushita S. Nishi K. Watanabe H. Kobayashi S. Suenaga A. Otagiri M. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2000; 23: 893-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the present photolabeling experiment, in order to determine the photolabeling specificity of [3H]UCN-01, we used staurosporine and UCN-02 (a stereoisomer of UCN-01), which also bind hAGP, as competitors. All staurosporine analogs significantly inhibited photoincorporation, by more than 60% (Fig. 4). Other competitors that we used were representatives of other hAGP ligands: an acidic drug (warfarin), a basic drug (propranolol), and a steroid (progesterone). Warfarin and propranolol inhibited binding by less than 30%, but to a significant degree, whereas progesterone inhibited binding by about 60% (Table I).Table IBinding affinity constant and inhibition percentage by the competitorsCompetitorKaInhibitionm-1%Cold UCN-01aBinding constant data taken from Ref. 382.88 × 10886.38StaurosporineaBinding constant data taken from Ref. 381.13 × 10768.54UCN-02aBinding constant data taken from Ref. 381.48 × 10661.52WarfarinbBinding constant data taken from Ref 591.08 × 10616.43ProgesteronebBinding constant data taken from Ref 591.00 × 10558.71PropranololbBinding constant data taken from Ref 592.98 × 10526.26a Binding constant data taken from Ref. 38Katsuki M.

The major radioactive peptides were eluted in 10.5-11.5 min (Fig. 5, A and B). The fractions eluted within this time frame were collected and concentrated with a SpeedVac evaporator for further capillary HPLC analysis. The concentrated sample from previous HPLC analysis was separated and simultaneously blotted onto a strip of PVDF membrane using an ABI 173 A MicroBlotter Capillary HPLC System. Autoradiographic analysis of the PVDF membrane indicated that the radioactive spot corresponded to the peak observed at 84-85 min (Fig. 6, A and B). Edman sequencing of this spot revealed an amino acid sequence of SDVVYTDXK (Fig. 7), corresponding to Ser-153 to Lys-161 of hAGP.Fig. 6Chromatogram of capillary HPLC and autoradiogram of blotted PVDF membrane.A, UV-absorption (210 nm).

Fibronectin showed increased expression of the 53- and 29-kDa fragments in skin and wounds from CyC-AP-null mice. Type I collagen had an initial degraded pattern in the skin of CyC-AP-null mice, which did not occur in wild-type mice. MMP-3, MMP-13, MMP-14, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) had a higher expression in CyC-AP-null skin.

MMP-13 expression increased significantly in both CyC-AP-null and wild-type dermal fibroblasts after treatment with IL-1β or with TNFα. However, MMP-13 expression did not increase in CyC-AP-null fibroblasts but did increase only in wild-type fibroblasts after FN-45 and FN-70 treatment. MMP-3 activation was induced by FN-45 and did not show a difference between CyC-AP-null and wild-type fibroblasts, suggesting different regulatory pathways for FN-45 on MMP-13 and MMP-3 expression.

CyC-AP is an important factor for the regulation of MMP-13 expression. Murine cyclophilin C-associated protein (CyC-AP) 1The abbreviations used are: CyC-AP, cyclophilin C-associated protein; ECM, extracellular matrix; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; IL, interleukin; FN, fibronectin; qPCR, quantitative PCR. was first identified as a 77 kDa intracellular protein, with a scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain, that binds to cyclophilin C in the absence of cyclosporin A (1Friedman J. Trahey M. Weissman I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6815-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Other researchers identified CyC-AP as a membrane protein on macrophages, which is expressed in most organs and in many cell types, including fibroblasts and macrophages. Its expression in macrophages can be induced by cell adherence and either interferon-γ and TNFα exposure (2Chicheportiche Y. Vassalli P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5512-5517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have confirmed that CyC-AP exists as a secreted protein in bone marrow stromal line (3Trahey M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3006-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In addition, CyC-AP-null mice, which have normal growth and reproductive abilities, have lower survival rates after endotoxin exposure, suggesting that CyC-AP can down-regulate, or provide negative feedback, that limits the induced inflammatory response. Also, CyC-AP-null mice express significantly higher amounts of interferon-γ, TNFα, and interleukin-12 (IL-12) after exposure to endotoxin (3Trahey M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3006-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Until now, most researchers agreed that the 92 kDa-secreted glycoprotein, Mac-2 (also called galectin-3)-binding protein (Mac-2 BP) is the human homologous protein for CyC-AP. Mac-2 BP has 69% identity to CyC-AP; it has been isolated from diverse human body fluids and is secreted by many types of tumor cells. Mac-2 BP is also thought to be involved in cell-cell adhesion associated with both inflammatory and metastatic invasion processes (4Rosenberg I. Cherayil B.J. Isselbacher K.J. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18731-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Inohara H. Akahani S. Koths K. Raz A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4530-4534PubMed Google Scholar, 6Koths K. Taylor E. Halenbeck R. Casipit C. Wang A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14245-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies have reported that some cancer cell lines release two types of Mac-2 BP, i.e. Mac-2 BP1 and Mac-2 BP2, with molecular masses of 92 and 70 kDa, which are determined by post-translational modification or proteolytic degradation (4Rosenberg I. Cherayil B.J. Isselbacher K.J. Pillai S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18731-18736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Some reports have suggested that Mac-2 BP may be an adhesive protein of extracellular matrix (ECM). Ultrastructural studies indicate that Mac-2 BP forms a ring-like structural protein by self-assembly of two monomers in ECM. Mac-2 BP also interacts with ECM proteins, for example it binds to collagen types IV, V, and VI, but not collagen types I and III. Among the ECM proteins, Mac-2 BP has been shown to have highest binding affinity to fibronectin (7Sasaki T. Brakebusch C. Engel J. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Mac-2 BP adheres to cells through binding to the β1 integrin, which can be inhibited by antibody to the β1 integrin. Until now, the regulatory effect of Mac-2 BP on functions in the cytosol or ECM was unclear. Although more than 20 matrix metalloproteinases have been identified (8Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar, 9Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar), the initial degradation of interstitial collagen is only performed by MMP-1, -8, and -13 (also known as collagenase 1, -2, -3, respectively). MMP-3 is reported to be involved in the activation of these collagenases (10Moilanen M. Sorsa T. Stenman M. Nyberg P. Lindy O. Vesterinen J. Paju A. Konttinen Y.T. Stenman U.H. Salo T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5414-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MMP-2 and MMP-14 (membrane type 1 MMP) are also reported to have interstitial collagenase function (11Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 12Ohuchi E. Imai K. Fujii Y. Sato H. Seiki M. Okada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2446-2451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The expression of MMP-13 has been demonstrated in cancer and arthritic diseases (13Moore B.A. Aznavoorian S. Engler J.A. Windsor L.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1502: 307-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14Etoh T. Inoue H. Yoshikawa Y. Barnard G.F. Kitano S. Mori M. Gut. 2000; 47: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) to degrade collagen during disease progression. The regulation of MMP-13 expression is multifactorial and includes cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), serotonin, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (15Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1259-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 16Singer C.F. Marbaix E. Lemoine P. Courtoy P.J. Eeckhout Y. Eur. J.

Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 532: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and fibronectin fragments. The gelatin-binding fibronectin fragments, sizes 110 kDa and 45 kDa, induce MMP-13 synthesis in chondrocytes (21Stanton H. Ung L. Fosang A.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 22Loeser R.F. Forsyth C.B. Samarel A.M. Im H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24577-24585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The C-terminal heparin-binding fibronectin fragment increases the release of MMP-1, -3, and -13 (23Yasuda T. Shimizu M. Nakagawa T. Julovi S.M. Nakamura T. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 153-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The 29-kDa N-terminal fibronectin fragment has been reported to have potent chondrolytic activity (24Homandberg G.A. Meyers R. Xie D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3597-3604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the 29-kDa fibronectin fragment has a TNFα binding site, and the binding to TNFα cannot be released by TNFα receptors (25Alon R. Cahalon L. Hershkoviz R. Elbaz D. Reizis B. Wallach D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Lider O. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1304-1313PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the 70-kDa gelatin binding fragment decreases activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 (26Penc S.F. Blumenstock F.A. Kaplan J.E. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1998; 64: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Different signaling pathways regulate MMP-13 expression. IL-1 induces MMP-13 via p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (27Mengshol J.A. Vincenti M.P. Brinckerhoff C.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4361-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Serotonin induces MMP-13 by protein kinase C and extracellular signal-regulated pathway 1/2 MAP kinase pathways (18Shum J.K. Melendez J.A. Jeffrey J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42830-42840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), while tumor growth factor β operates through the p38 MAP kinase pathway (17Ravanti L. Toriseva M. Penttinen R. Crombleholme T. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1098-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The MMP-13 and MMP-3 regulatory pathway with fibronectin fragments is thought to occur via an IL-1-independent pathway, because an IL-1 antagonist could not block fibronectin fragment-induced MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression (21Stanton H. Ung L. Fosang A.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, blocking antibodies to integrins α2β1 and α5β1 increases MMP-13 production through the same pathway as IL-1 (28Forsyth C.B. Pulai J. Loeser R.F. Arthritis Rheum. 2002; 46: 2368-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In the present study, the potential function of CyC-AP during skin wound healing was studied in CyC-AP-null mice. We report that the expression of the 53 and 29 kDa fibronectin fragments, MMP-3, MMP-13, MMP-14, as well as TNFα, is significantly higher in both unwounded and wounded skin in CyC-AP-null mice. When treated with IL-1β or TNFα, both CyC-AP-null and wild-type dermal fibroblasts release high amounts of MMP-13. In contrast, after treatment with FN-45 or FN-70, MMP-13 expression does not change in CyC-AP-null fibroblasts but increases in wild-type fibroblasts. In addition, the activated form of MMP-3 is induced by FN-45 in both CyC-AP and wild-type fibroblasts. Our data suggest the following. (a) Many compensational in vivo pathways are involved in the regulation of MMP-13 expression. (b) For MMP-13 expression, the regulatory pathway by fibronectin fragments might be the main pathway during normal physiologic conditions; however, when the fibronectin fragment regulatory pathway is blocked, such as by the deletion of CyC-AP, then the IL-1 and TNFα regulatory pathways compensate and stimulate MMP-13 expression. Our data are the first to show that CyC-AP is an important factor necessary for fibronectin fragment-induced MMP-13 expression. CyC-AP may exert its effect through binding to either fibronectin or integrin receptors. Animals and Materials—C57BL background, CyC-AP-null mice and wild-type mice were a kind gift from Dr. Irving L. Weissman (3Trahey M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3006-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Animals were bred and maintained in the Stanford Animal Care Laboratory. Mice received food and water ad libitum. All procedures with animals were conducted in accordance with university-approved protocols according to National Institutes of Health guidelines. RNAzol B was from Tel-Tech (Friendswood, TX). Secondary antibodies, Ready-To-Go dCTP labeling kit, and NICK columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-smooth muscle α-actin, anti-type 1 collagen, FN-45, and FN-70 were from Sigma. Anti-MMP-1 and anti-MMP-13 antibodies were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). All other antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Reagents for real time quantitative RT-PCR were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). TNFα ELISA kit was from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Wounding Procedure on Mice—2-month-old wild-type mice or CyC-AP-null mice were anesthetized with ketamine (87 mg/kg) and xylazine (13 mg/kg) via subcutaneous injection. Hair on the dorsal skin was shaved, and skin cleaned with 75% ethanol. Four separate 6-mm diameter excisional wounds were created on the dorsal skin of each mouse, and the size of the wounds was measured daily. Wounds were collected daily for 7–10 days and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for later protein analysis. Unwounded skin from each mouse was pooled for use as normal, unwounded, skin controls. Three separate wounding groups were used for repeated assays. Fibroblast Cultures—The dorsal skin of 15-day-old wild-type or CyC-AP-null mice was sterilized and removed. After digestion in 0.3% of dispase at 37 °C for 1 h, the dermal layer was removed from epidermal layer using fine forceps. The dermal layer was further digested in 0.1% collagenase for about 20 min in a 37 °C shaking water bath; then the isolated cells were collected and cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 10 percent fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humid incubator with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged to up to four times before experiments. 200,000 cells from two separated wild-type and CyC-AP-null cell preparations were seated in a 35-mm diameter dish with DMEM and 10 percent fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed the next day with fresh serum-free medium three times and then treated with either IL-1β (10 ng/ml), TNFα (10 ng/ml), FN-45 (0.5 μm), or FN-70 (0.5 μm) in serum-free medium. After forty-eight hours, medium was collected and centrifuged to remove the suspended cells and stored at –70 °C. Protein Purification—Unwounded or wounded skin tissue from CyC-AP-null or wild-type mice was collected and stored immediately in liquid nitrogen until protein analysis. Tissues were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris at pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, proteinase mixture (Sigma). Protein in the homogenized mixture was purified by centrifuging at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Protein lysates from cultured cells were sonicated, followed with centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Next, protein concentration was measured, and protein was stored at –80 °C in small volumes. Protein from cultured medium was concentrated by centrifuging in a Microcon concentration column before protein measurement. Immunoblot Analysis—50 μg of protein from each tissue or cell sample or 20 μg protein from culture medium were heated at 100 °C for 5 min (except for the detection of collagen type I, which requires no heating per the manufacturer) and then separated by 10 or 4–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Each molecule was detected by specific antibody. Each antibody dilution was performed according to the recommendation of the manufacturer. Bands were visualized by blot exposure to x-ray film after 1 min of reaction with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Western blot detection was repeated at least three times using three different groups of wounded samples. Primer Design—Primers were designed by the software Primer-Express (Applied Biosystems) specifically written for quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The PCR product was a single ∼100-bp band. For TNFα gene expression, the forward primer was 5′-GACGTGGAACTGGCAG-AAGAG, and the reverse primer was 5′-TGCCACAAGCAGGAATG-AGA. For MMP-3, the forward primer was 5′-TCCTGATGTTGGTGG-CTTCAG and the reverse primer was 5′-TGTCTTGGCAAATCCGGT-GTA. For MMP-14, the forward primer was 5′-ACCTGCGTACCCACA-CACAA and the reverse primer was 5′-CAAATCAGCCTTGCCTGTCA. Real Time qPCR—Dorsal skin from either wild-type or CyC-AP-null mice was collected, and RNA extracted by TRIzol using the methods described by the manufacturer. Fibroblasts were cultured on 100-mm plastic dishes until confluent. After aspiration of the medium, total RNA was extracted by TRIzol. Purified RNA from either skin or cells was reconstituted in water, quantified, and treated with DNase I for 30 min at 37 °C. RNA was then repurified using a column and RNA washing solution (Qiagen). 2 μg of total RNA was then reverse-transcribed in 100 μl of reverse transcriptase mixture containing 1× Taq-Man RT buffer, 5.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 500 μmol/liter each dNTP, 2.5 μmol/liter random hexamers, 400 killiunit/liter RNase inhibitor, and 1.25 killiunit/liter Multiscribe reverse transcriptase. Reverse transcription was performed at 25 °C for 10 min, 48 °C for 30 min, and 95 °C for 5 min. SYBR-green dye was used for qPCR, which emits while binding to any dsDNA product. Therefore, the cDNA products were first tested by regular PCR and run on a 1 percent agarose gel to examine the specificity of the single gene production. Quantitative PCR was performed in a 384-well plate, each well containing 20 μl of mixture cDNA sample, gene-specific primers, and 1× SYBR-green PCR master mixture (Applied Biosystems). The qPCR cycler (ABI PRISM, 7900HT, Applied Biosystems) was run at the parameters of 2 min at 50 °C, 10 min at 95 °C, and followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C. The threshold cycle (Ct) value, corresponding to the number of cycles after which emission reached 10 standard deviations above the mean baseline during monitoring, was used for analysis. Each target gene was run on a serial dilution of control cDNA from which the standard curve was obtained for calculation of change in Ct value. Ribosomal RNA 18 S was used as an internal control gene for data calculation. Each detection was performed in triplicate wells, and RNA from at least three different mice was tested separately. Fibroblast RNA was obtained from two different groups of cultured cells. Statistical Analysis—The Ct value obtained from qPCR for each target gene of each sample was compared with its Ct values of the standard curve obtained by serial dilution of control cDNA for the determination of the number of gene copies. The value was then normalized with the internal control (18 S) gene to minimize the loading error. Normalized results were expressed as the ratio of copies of target gene to copies of the18 S gene. The difference between two groups was compared by calculating the mean and standard deviation with an un-paired, two-tailed Student's t test. A p value of ≤ 0.05 was considered significant. Increased Fibronectin Fragments in CyC-AP-null Skin— Monoclonal anti-fibronectin antibody that can react with multiple fragments of fibronectin was used (29Garcia-Pardo A. Sanchez-Aparicio P. Wayner E.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the expression of soluble fibronectin in CyC-AP-null and wild-type mice in unwounded and wounded skin samples. Two fibronectin fragments, about 53 and 29 kDa, were consistently higher in CyC-AP-null mice in both unwounded and wounded skin. These fibronectin fragments have a similar pattern to that described by Hayashi and Yamada (30Hayashi M. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11292-11300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which was induced after elastase treatment. This pattern suggests higher degradation of fibronectin in the skin of CyC-AP-null mice. Increased Expression of Interstitial Collagenases during Wound Repair—The expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 was examined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2). The expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 was higher in both pro- and activated form in the skin of CyC-AP-null mice compared with wild-type; the expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 was further increased during wound repair in CyC-AP-null skin. However, the higher expression of MMP-14 in CyC-AP-null mice did not show an increased pattern during wound repair. The protein expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 (Fig. 3), and the gene expression of MMP-3 and MMP-14 (Fig. 4) were higher in unwounded CyC-AP-null skin compared to wild-type skin. MMP-3 gene expression was ∼7-fold higher (p ≤ 0.05), and MMP-14 gene expression was about 4.2-fold higher (p ≤ 0.05) in CyC-AP-null skin by qPCR (Fig. 4).Fig. 3Expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13 in normal skin by immunoblot analysis. Skin samples from three wild type (WT1–WT3) and four CyC-AP–/– (KO1–KO4) mice were separated by 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE. The expression of pro-MMP-3, ∼66 kDa, and the activated form of MMP-3, ∼45kDa, was higher in CyC-AP–/– mice. Pro-(MMP-13) and activated (arrow only) bands of MMP-13 are more highly expressed in the skin of CyC-AP–/– mice than wild-type mice. α-Tubulin expression was used as internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 4Expression of MMP-3 and MMP-14 in normal skin by real time quantitative PCR. A shows that the gene expression of MMP-3 in skin of CyC-AP–/– (KO-skin) was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) than that of wild-type mice (WT-skin). B shows that MMP-14 expression was significantly higher (p ≤ 0.05) in the skin of CyC-AP–/– (KO-skin) mice than wild-type (WT-skin) mice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expression of TNFα in CyC-AP-null Skin and Wounds—The expression of TNFα was examined by ELISA and qPCR. TNFα expression was increased in both CyC-AP-null and wild-type skin after wounding. However, after wounding, the change in TNFα expression in CyC-AP-null mice showed a slower increase during the first 2 days (Fig. 5). The gene expression of TNFα was significantly higher in unwounded CyC-AP-null skin (9.3-fold, p ≤ 0.05) by qPCR (Fig. 5B), which also supports the ELISA data in unwounded skin (Fig. 5A). Increased Degradation of Type I Collagen in the Skin of CyC-AP-null Mice—Specific anti-type I collagen antibody (Sigma) was used in Western blots to detect collagen expression on the unwounded (Fig. 6A) and wounded (Fig. 6B) skin of wild-type and CyC-AP-null mice. Skin samples from two wild-type and two CyC-AP-null mice are shown in Fig. 6A. Type I collagen from CyC-AP-null mice had a higher initial degradation pattern, i.e. in the form of gelatin. Type I collagen expression showed three bands: 1) ∼120 kDa, the intact α-chain; 2) ∼90 kDa, the initial cleavage product containing band 3/4 length with the N terminus; and 3) ∼40 kDa band, the initial cleavage product containing band 1/4 length with the C terminus. This pattern has been described as the initial cleavage of interstitial collagen (11Aimes R.T. Quigley J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5872-5876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Fig. 6B shows the expression of type I collagen in wounded skin samples from both CyC-AP-null and wild-type mice. On day 1 post-wounding, the initial degradation of collagen in wild-type mice was increased, but rapidly returned back to the normal level by day 6 post-wounding. In contrast, collagen type I expression in CyC-AP-null mice remained the same in both unwounded and wounded skin. It had an initial degradation pattern that did not change with wounding. MMP-13 Expression Is Up-regulated by IL-1β or TNFα—The expression of MMP-13 from wild-type and CyC-AP-null fibroblasts treated with IL-1β and TNFα was tested by immunoblot analysis. Both IL-1β and TNFα can induce MMP-13 expression in both CyC-AP-null and wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 7). However, MMP-13 expression was higher in wild-type cells, at the basal level, compared to CyC-AP-null cells, and the induction of MMP-13 by cytokines is stronger in wild-type compared to CyC-AP-null fibroblasts. The blots were further stained with Coomassie Blue for the control of protein loading. The Effect of FN-45 on the Expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13—The expression of MMP-13 and MMP-3 in wild-type and CyC-AP-null fibroblasts was tested by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 8). After FN-45 treatment, the activated form of MMP-3 (45 kDa) was induced in both wild-type and CyC-AP-null fibroblasts. Both wild-type and CyC-AP fibroblasts had similar expression of pro- and activated MMP-3 after administration of FN-45; however, the activated form in CyC-AP-null was higher compared to wild-type fibroblasts. In our study, we did not observe increased pro-MMP-3 (66 kDa) after FN-45 stimulation, indicating the synthesis of MMP-3 was not increased but the activated form was increased by FN-45. The most important difference between CyC-AP-null and wild-type cells was observed on MMP-13 expression after FN-45 treatment. FN-45 increased the expression of MMP-13 only in wild-type fibroblasts and not in CyC-AP-null fibroblasts. MMP-13 showed a low expression both before and after FN-45 treatment in CyC-AP-null fibroblasts. This blot for MMP-13 was stained with Coomassie Blue for a control of protein loading. The protein stain shows that the MMP-3 represents the major protein in the medium. The Effect of FN-70 on the Expression of MMP-3 and MMP-13—MMP-3 expression after FN-70 treatment did not show a difference in CyC-AP-null or wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 9). However, FN-70 shifted the pro-MMP-3 band up to a heavier band; this pattern was the same in both wild-type and CyC-AP-null cells. Similar to FN-45, FN-70 treatment increased both pro- and activated MMP-13 only in wild-type, but not in the CyC-AP-null fibroblasts. In the present study, we identified the function of CyC-AP and determined that CyC-AP is an important mediator for FN-induced MMP-13 expression. We found that CyC-AP-null mice have increased MMP-3, MMP-13, and MMP-14 gene and protein expression in skin, although they have a normal skin phenotype. Furthermore, TNFα and the 53- and 29-kDa fibronectin fragments have greater expression in the skin of CyC-AP-null mice. Our unwounded skin data suggest that deletion of CyC-AP induces TNFα, FNs, and possibly other unidentified factors that increase MMP expression. Likely candidates that are known to increase MMP expression include TNFα, IL-1, FNs, TGFβ, serotonin, and MIF (15Siwik D.A. Chang D.L. Colucci W.S. Circ.

We also observed that type I collagen, the substrate for the increased MMPs, had a higher initial degradation pattern in unwounded skin. After skin wounding, MMP-13 expression was increased in both CyC-AP-null and wild-type mice but the increase in CyC-AP-null mice was much greater than wild-type mice (Fig. 2, upper blot). However, TNFα expression after wounding did not correlate with MMP-13 expression (Fig. 5A). TNFα was increased in both CyC-AP-null and wild-type mice after wounding, but the increase was lower during the first 2 days, and the peak was lower in the CyC-AP-null mice. These observations suggest that deletion of CyC-AP may make cells more susceptible to pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα. Alternatively other factors, such as IL-1 and MIF may be expressed in greater amounts in CyC-AP-null mice during wound repair, and the additive effect of those factors may be to induce higher expression of MMP-13. In addition, MMP-3 expression was slightly increased after wounding, but did not have the similar peaking pattern of MMP-13 (Fig. 2). In addition, the 53 kDa FN (Fig. 1B) and MMP-14 (Fig. 2, lower blot) did not increase after wounding in either wild-type or CyC-AP-null mice, suggesting TNFα and other wound-related cytokines are not involved in the regulation of FNs and MMP-14. To further understand the function of CyC-AP, we investigated the mechanism of the up-regulated inflammatory factors in CyC-AP-null mice using primary cultured dermal fibroblasts. Both wild-type and CyC-AP-null fibroblasts react to TNFα and IL-1β to release MMP-13 (Fig. 7). However, CyC-AP-null cells do not react to FN-45 and FN-70 with MMP-13 induction, unlike wild-type fibroblasts (Figs. 8 and 9). This suggests CyC-AP is involved in the fibronectin fragment-induced MMP-13 expression regulatory pathway. Our data are the first to indicate that CyC-AP is an important mediator in the regulation of the expression of MMPs and cytokines during inflammation. Fibronectin fragments influence a variety of cellular processes through interaction with integrin cell surface molecules, and through its binding sites for several important biological molecules, including heparin, gelatin, and fibrin (31Romberger D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 939-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The human analog to CyC-AP, Mac-2 BP, is reported to have the ability to bind either fibronectin or integrin β1, suggesting CyC-AP exerts its effects through binding to fibronectin or integrins. However, in our study, the effects on the activation of MMP-3 by FN-45 and FN-70 in CyC-AP-null was same as that on wild-type cells, suggesting deletion of CyC-AP did not change the binding of different FNs to their receptors. Although the deletion of CyC-AP did not change MMP-3 expression by FN-45 and FN-70, it totally abolished MMP-13 expression induced by the FNs. This finding suggests that the FN regulatory expression pathways for MMP-3 and MMP-13 are different. These observations also indicate the effects of CyC-AP may be downstream of fibronectin receptors, i.e. functional CyC-AP may be located on the cell membrane or in the cytoplasm. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that CyC-AP was first identified from cell extracts. In addition, CyC-AP-null fibroblasts have a lower expression of MMP-13 at the basal level compared to wild-type fibroblasts, suggesting the fibronectin fragment-regulated pathway for MMP-13 expression may be the dominant pathway during normal physiological conditions. Interestingly, FN-45 induced the up-regulation of activated MMP-3 but not pro-MMP-3, in both CyC-AP-null and wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 8, upper blot). This observation suggests that FNs may also influence other intracellular proteases, which in turn activate MMP-3, because pro-MMP-3 can be activated by cathepsin (32Okada Y. Nakanishi I. FEBS Lett. 1989; 249: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although FN-45 increases activated MMP-3, FN-70 does not show this effect, suggesting that these FNs may each have specific binding sites or receptors for their biological function. These observations need to be clarified in future studies. In our study, two FN bands, 53 and 29 kDa were increased in CyC-AP-null skin (Fig. 1). Through testing the effects of FN-45 and FN-70 on MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression, we believe that the 53 kDa fibronectin may have a similar biological effect as FN-45. Because activated MMP-3 was only increased by FN-45 but not by FN-70, the increased MMP-3 in CyC-AP-null skin may be the result of the elevated FN-53. Although no direct information about the effects of the 29-kDa fibronectin fragment on the regulation of MMP-3 and MMP-13 has been reported, we believe that FN-29 may have similar effects as FN-45. Chronic inflammation is associated with many diseases, such as arthritis, cancer, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease, which place a heavy burden on society. Elevated cytokines, MMPs, and fibronectin fragments have been reported in these diseases; however, recent evidence indicates that fibronectin fragments function as modulators for cell survival (33Sakai T. Johnson K.J. Murozono M. Sakai K. Magnuson M.A. Wieloch T. Cronberg T. Isshiki A. Erickson H.P. Fassler R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 324-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and can inhibit tumor growth and metastasis (34Yi M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, MMP-3 has been found to promote host defense during tumorigenesis (35McCawley L.J. Crawford H.C. King Jr., L.E. Mudgett J. Matrisian L.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 6965-6972Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We believe the increased fibronectin fragments play a host defense role in CyC-AP-null mice, and the FNs may exert their effect through two regulatory pathways: (a) an increase of activated MMP-3 to support cell survival and (b) binding to TNFα to reduce receptor-activated TNFα. The TNFα binding site on FN-29 has been described (25Alon R. Cahalon L. Hershkoviz R. Elbaz D. Reizis B. Wallach D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Lider O. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 1304-1313PubMed Google Scholar). From our in vivo and in vitro studies, we found that CyC-AP functions as a mediator for FN-induced MMP-13 expression. Loss of CyC-AP function in vivo causes constantly higher TNFα expression through unclear compensatory pathways, which in turn induce MMP-13 release above the normal physiological level. We believe other unidentified cytokines may also be elevated, and together, these elevated factors induce other pro-inflammatory reactions. Fibronectin fragments are increased and compete with TNFα and induce MMP-3 expression. We also observed increased MMP-14 at both the gene and protein levels in the CyC-AP-null skin, and the relationship of increased MMP-14 in the CyC-AP-null case will be further studied. CyC-AP has been reported to have an important role in the anti-inflammatory response to endotoxin (3Trahey M. Weissman I.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3006-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fibronectin fragments have been shown to inhibit in vivo tumor growth and metastasis (34Yi M. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and function in self-protection during pathological conditions. Our data indicate that CyC-AP is an important mediator for fibronectin fragment-induced MMP-13 expression. We conclude that CyC-AP functions in host defense during inflammatory disease. We thank Dr. Irving Weissman for the CyC-AP-null and wild-type mice."

The c-myb proto-oncogene product (c-Myb) positively regulates proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells, whereas p53 blocks cell cycle progression. Here, we demonstrate that p53 inhibits c-Myb-induced transcription and transformation by directly binding to c-Myb. The ability of c-Myb to maintain the undifferentiated state of M1 cells was also suppressed by p53. p53 did not affect the ability of c-Myb to bind to DNA but formed a ternary complex with the corepressor mSin3A and c-Myb. Thus, p53 antagonizes c-Myb by recruiting mSin3A to down-regulate specific Myb target genes. p53 is known to repress transcription of a number of genes, but the mechanism of p53 recruitment to these target genes is unknown.

Thus, p53 antagonizes c-Myb by recruiting mSin3A to down-regulate specific Myb target genes. The product of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene, p53, monitors the cellular response to various stresses, including genotoxic damage. In response to these stimuli, p53 becomes post-translationally stabilized and activated as a transcription factor (for review see Refs. 1Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar, 2Levine A.J. Cell. 1997; 88: 323-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6673) Google Scholar, 3Vogelstein B.

The cellular outcomes of this response are cell cycle arrest at the G1 or G2/M checkpoints and/or induction of apoptosis. This is related to its function as a sequence-specific transcription factor for the induction of a group of target genes, including p21waf1/cip1 (4El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B.

The consensus p53-binding element has been found in many promoters that are activated by p53. Transcriptional mediators, including the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP, and arginine methyltransferases, PRMT1 and CARM1, have critical roles in p53-dependent transcriptional activation (5An W. Kim J. Roeder R.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 735-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Conversely, p53 has been shown to repress a variety of cellular promoters. The genes found to be negatively regulated following p53 induction include Map4, DNA topoisomerase IIα, presenilin-1, bcl-2, and others (6Murphy M. Hinman A. Levine A.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2971-2980Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Wang Q. Zambetti G.P. Suttle D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Roperch J.P. Alvaro V.

Certain human tumor-derived mutant forms of p53 are defective at trans-repression but not trans-activation (10Ryan K.M. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3692-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Deletion of the proline-rich region of p53 renders it defective at apoptosis induction and trans-repression, but not trans-activation (11Walker K.K. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15335-15340Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 12Venot C. Maratrat M. Dureuil C. Conseiller E. Bracco L. Debussche L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4668-4679Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Thus, transcriptional repression by p53 plays an important role in p53-dependent growth control. The interaction of p53 with the corepressor mSin3A is required for p53 to repress transcription (13Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). However, no consensus-binding element of p53 has been clearly identified in most of the p53-repressible promoters. Thus, the mechanism by which p53 is recruited to these target genes remains unknown; one possibility, addressed in this report, is that p53 interacts with other transcription factors bound to p53-repressed promoters. The expression level of the c-myb proto-oncogene is high in immature hematopoietic cells, and its expression is turned off during differentiation (14Gonda T.J. Metcalf D. Nature. 1984; 310: 249-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Similarly, the c-myb mRNA level is down-regulated during IL-6 1The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; c-Myb, c-myb proto-oncogene product; DBD, DNA-binding domain; NRD, negative regulatory domain; v-Myb, viral myb gene product; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.1The abbreviations used are: IL-6, interleukin-6; c-Myb, c-myb proto-oncogene product; DBD, DNA-binding domain; NRD, negative regulatory domain; v-Myb, viral myb gene product; GST, glutathione S-transferase; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.-induced differentiation of M1 myeloblastic cells into macrophages, whereas constitutive expression of exogenous c-myb blocks this differentiation (15Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A study of c-myb-deficient mice indicated that c-myb is essential for proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells (16Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schereiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pietryga D.W. Scott W.J. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar), and analysis of tissue-specific c-myb KO mice revealed that c-myb is also required for T cell development at several stages (17Bender T.P. Kremer C.S. Kraus M. Buch T. Rajewsky K. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 721-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The c-myb gene product (c-Myb) binds to a specific DNA sequence and regulates transcription (18Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K-H.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2720-2731Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In addition, c-Myb activates the chaperone gene promoters by interacting with heat shock transcription factor 3 without directly binding to the promoter itself (26Kanei-Ishii C. Tanikawa J. Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Ishii S. Science. 1997; 277: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). c-Myb has three functional domains that are responsible for DNA binding, transcriptional activation, and negative regulation (19Sakura H. Kanei-Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of c-Myb consists of three imperfect tandem repeats of 51–52 amino acids, each containing a variant helix-turn-helix motif (27Ogata K. Morikawa S. Nakamura H. Sekikawa A. Inoue T. Kanai H. Sarai A. Ishii S. Nishimura Y. Cell. 1994; 79: 639-648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The transcriptional co-activator CBP binds to the c-Myb transcriptional activation domain (28Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Hou D.X. Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Takahashi T. Ishii S. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 528-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Deletion of the negative regulatory domain increases both trans-activation and transformation capability, implying that the negative regulatory domain normally represses c-Myb activity (19Sakura H.

Recently, we reported that multiple corepressors, including Ski and mSin3A, bind directly to the DBD and the negative regulatory domain of c-Myb, and inhibit c-Myb-dependent trans-activation (32Nomura T. Tanikawa J. Akimaru H. Kanei-Ishii C. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Khan M.M. Ito H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16715-16726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that p53 directly interacts with c-Myb bound to promoters of certain Myb target genes, and inhibits c-Myb-induced transcription of these genes by recruiting mSin3A. Thus, c-Myb-p53 interaction is critical in the selection of the target genes to be repressed. In Vitro Binding Assay—GST pull-down assays were performed as described previously (33Tanikawa J. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kanei-Ishii C. Nakai A. Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15578-15585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Binding buffer consisted of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 01% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl. Sumoylated GST-p53 was prepared as follows. His-tagged Aos1-Uba2 fusion protein (34Uchimura Y. Nakao M. Saitoh H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 564: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), His-tagged Ubc9, GST-SUMO-1, and GST-SUMO-2 were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Aos-Uba2 (0.2 μm), Ubc9 (3 μm), SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 (20 μm), and GST-p53 (10 μm) were incubated in the sumoylation buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm ATP, 5% glycerol) at 30 °C for 4 h. Co-immunoprecipitation Assay—To study the interaction between c-Myb and p53, 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of the c-Myb expression plasmid, pact-c-Myb (3 μg), and the p53 expression plasmid, pact-p53 (0.5 μg). Forty hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer A (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 250 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10 μm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). After reducing the final NaCl concentration to 150 mm by adding lysis buffer A, which lacks NaCl, immunoprecipitation was performed with rabbit antibody raised against GST-p53, and the immunocomplexes were subjected to Western blotting with an anti-Myb monoclonal antibody 1.1. For co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous c-Myb and p53, lysates were prepared from Molt-4 cells by mild sonication in LSLD buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, 20% glycerol), and immunoprecipitated with the rabbit antibody against GST-p53. The immunocomplexes were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myb 1.1. For two-step co-immunoprecipitation, 293T cells were transfected with a mixture of the FLAG-c-Myb expression plasmid pact-FLAG-c-Myb (3 μg) and the p53 expression plasmid pact-p53 (0.5 μg). For first immunoprecipitation controls, the pact-c-Myb plasmid, which expresses untagged c-Myb was used. Forty hours after transfection, cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer A. After reducing the final NaCl concentration to 150 mm, the lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma), and the beads were washed with lysis buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl. The FLAG-linked complexes were eluted with lysis buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and 3× FLAG peptide (100 μg/ml). After decreasing the concentration of 3× FLAG peptide to 25 μg/ml by adding lysis buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or control IgG were used for second immunoprecipitation. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Using the LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen), 293T or HepG2 cells were co-transfected with a mixture of the 6MBS-Luc reporter (0.2 μg), the c-Myb expression plasmid pcDNA3-c-Myb (0.1 μg), the p53 expression plasmid pcDNA3-p53 (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μg), and internal control plasmid pRL-TK (Invitrogen) (0.05 μg). Cells were also transfected with the c-myc-Luc reporter (0.2 μg) together with the c-Myb expression plasmid (1 μg), the p53 expression plasmid (0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 μg), and internal control plasmid pRL-TK (0.05 μg). The amount of total DNA was adjusted to 2.0 μg with the control empty vector. In the experiments shown in Fig. 2C, transfected cells were treated with adriamycin (Sigma) at 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 μg/ml for 24 h before the luciferase assays. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activities were analyzed using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Transformation and Analysis of M1 Cell Clones—Fetal liver cells were isolated from E14.5 embryos, which were obtained by mating p53+/– males and females (35Tsukada T. Tomooka Y. Takai S. Ueda Y.

Transformation assays using fetal liver cells and the retroviruses encoding various forms of Myb were performed as described previously (36Ferrao P. Macmillan E.M. Ashman L.K. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1631-1638PubMed Google Scholar). M1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The retroviral vectors for c-Myb and p53ts were constructed using the murine stem cell virus-based retroviral vector, and M1 cell clones expressing c-Myb together with neomycin-resistance gene were isolated as described (32Nomura T. Tanikawa J. Akimaru H. Kanei-Ishii C. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Khan M.M. Ito H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16715-16726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Several independent clones were isolated, and their level of c-Myb expression was measured. Using the M1 cell clones containing c-myb virus, cell pools expressing the p53ts mutant were isolated by selecting the enhanced green fluorescence protein-positive cells. M1 cell clones were induced to differentiate with IL-6 (50 ng/ml, Wako) after seeding at a concentration of 1 × 105 cells/ml for 72 h at 32 °C. Cells were stained with a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse CD14 monoclonal antibody (BD Pharmingen) on ice for 30 min after blocking with 3% fetal bovine serum and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). DNA Microarrays—RNA was prepared from various types of M1 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and biotin-labeled RNA for Gene-Chip analysis was then prepared according to the protocol, which is available on the Affymetrix web site. The Mouse Genome Array that contains 39,000 transcripts (Affymetrix, 430 2.0) was used for the analysis. Gel Retardation Assays and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Gel retardation assays were performed using a double-stranded oligonucleotide probe containing Myb binding site-I as described before (37Tanikawa J.

Proteins and antibodies were preincubated on ice for 4 h before initiation of the DNA binding reaction. Complexes were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide gels. ChIP assay was carried out as described before (32Nomura T. Tanikawa J. Akimaru H. Kanei-Ishii C. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Khan M.M. Ito H. Ishii S. J. Biol.

Direct Interaction of c-Myb with p53—We previously demonstrated that p53 binds to heat shock transcription factor 3 and inhibits c-Myb-induced heat shock transcription factor 3 activation (33Tanikawa J. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kanei-Ishii C. Nakai A. Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15578-15585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). During analysis of the interactions between p53, c-Myb, and heat shock transcription factor 3, we have found that p53 also directly binds to c-Myb. To further examine the interaction between c-Myb and p53, we performed GST pull-down assays using various forms of in vitro translated c-Myb and GST-p53 fusion proteins. The results indicate that the region containing repeats 2 and 3 in the DBD of c-Myb bind to GST-p53 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). The three hydrophobic amino acids on the surface of repeat 2 of c-Myb DBD, which are mutated into non-hydrophobic amino acids in the v-Myb encoded by avian myeloblastosis virus, are involved in interactions with various proteins, including C/EBPβ and corepressors such as Ski (38Tahirov T.H. Sato K. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Sasaki M. Inoue-Bungo T. Shiina M. Fujikawa A. Morii H. Kumasaka T. Yamamoto M. Ishii S. Ogata K.

However, the mutant R23 fragment of c-Myb (R23–3M), in which these amino acids are changed to the same non-hydrophobic amino acids found in v-Myb, efficiently bound to GST-p53 (Fig. 1A), as did the bacterially expressed R123 fragment of c-Myb (Fig. 1A). Thus, p53 directly binds to the DBD of c-Myb. To identify the regions of p53 that interact with c-Myb, we used various forms of in vitro translated p53 in pull-down assays with GST-c-Myb. The results indicate that the C-terminal 78-amino acid region, which contains the tetramerization domain, is responsible for the interaction with c-Myb (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S2). To investigate complex formation between c-Myb and p53 in vivo, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Lysates were prepared from 293T cells co-transfected with c-Myb and p53 expression plasmids and precipitated with anti-p53 antibody, after which the immunocomplex was subjected to Western blotting with anti-c-Myb antibody. Fig. 1C shows that c-Myb was co-precipitated by the anti-p53 antibody, but not the control IgG. We also performed co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins in Molt-4 cell lysates, where again we found that anti-p53 antibody co-precipitated c-Myb, whereas normal IgG did not (Fig. 1D). p53 Inhibits c-Myb-dependent trans-Activation—To determine whether p53 can affect c-Myb-induced trans-activation, we performed luciferase reporter assays using a reporter construct containing the Myb-binding sites (6MBS-Luci). Transfection of 293T cells or HepG2 cells with 6MBS-Luci, c-Myb expression vector and increasing amounts of p53 expression vector indicated that p53 suppressed c-Myb-induced trans-activation in a dose-dependent manner in both cell types (Fig. 2, A and B). Adriamycin treatment, which induces p53 protein expression, also inhibited c-Myb-induced luciferase expression from the 6MBS-Luci reporter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C). We next investigated the effect of p53 on c-Myb-dependent trans-activation of the promoter of a known c-Myb target gene, c-myc. Using a c-myc promoter-containing luciferase reporter (c-myc-Luci) it was found that p53 did suppress c-Myb-dependent transcription from this promoter (Fig. 2D). To investigate whether p53 also inhibits the activity of oncogenically activated forms of Myb, we used v-Myb, 3M, and CT3 in the luciferase reporter assays. v-Myb is encoded by avian myeloblastosis virus, whereas CT3 is a C-terminally truncated form of c-Myb; both of these forms of Myb have a strong transforming capacity. In the 3M mutant, the three hydrophobic amino acids in repeat 2 of the DBD have been replaced with non-hydrophobic amino acids, analogous to the avian myeloblastosis virus-encoded v-Myb. p53 inhibited c-myc promoter activity induced by all three forms of Myb (Fig. 2E), suggesting that oncogenic activation of c-myb is not due to the abrogation of negative regulation of c-Myb activity by p53. p53 Inhibits c-Myb Capacity to Control Cellular Proliferation—We next asked whether p53 plays a biological role as a negative regulator of c-Myb. To address this, we first examined the effect of p53 on the transforming capacity of Myb. Transforming recombinant retroviruses that express full-length wild-type c-Myb or the oncogenically activated C-truncated form CT3 were generated (36Ferrao P. Macmillan E.M. Ashman L.K. Gonda T.J. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1631-1638PubMed Google Scholar), and the capacity of these viruses to transform fetal liver cells prepared from wild-type, p53+/–, or p53–/– mice was compared. Loss of p53 enhanced transformation by these viruses in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A), demonstrating that p53 does suppress the transforming capacity of Myb. One element of the ability of Myb to transform hematopoietic cells is its capacity to suppress differentiation. We therefore next investigated the effect of overexpressing p53 on the capacity of c-Myb to maintain the undifferentiated state of M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells, which lack functional endogenous p53. Upon IL-6 stimulation, M1 cells undergo terminal differentiation into macrophage-like cells. However, constitutive expression of c-Myb in M1 cells blocks this IL-6-induced differentiation (15Selvakumaran M. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman-Liebermann B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2493-2500Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We generated M1 cell clones that constitutively express c-Myb alone, or both c-Myb and the temperature-sensitive mutant of p53 (p53ts), as well as control clones containing the empty vector (Fig. 3B). This p53ts mutant (Val-135 mutant) behaves like other p53 mutants at 37 °C, but like wild-type p53 at 32 °C (39Yonish-Rouach E. Resnitzky D. Lotem J. Sachs L. Kimchi A. Oren M. Nature. 1991; 352: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1984) Google Scholar). IL-6 treatment caused the control M1 cells to differentiate into macrophages and express the cell surface differentiation marker CD14 (Fig. 3C, left). In contrast, the cells constitutively expressing c-Myb did not efficiently express CD14 when IL-6 was added (Fig. 3C, middle). When p53 was overexpressed in the Myb-expressing cells at 32 °C, differentiation was induced in response to IL-6, resulting in increased CD14 positivity (Fig. 3C, right), whereas induction of differentiation was not observed at 37 °C (data not shown). Thus, p53 induces M1 cell differentiation by inhibiting c-Myb activity. p53 Down-regulates Multiple c-Myb Target Genes—To investigate whether p53 induction leads to suppression of c-Myb target genes, including c-myc, we determined by DNA array analysis how many and which c-Myb-induced genes are regulated by p53. RNAs were prepared from the M1 cells constitutively expressing c-Myb and from control M1 cells, which were treated with IL-6 for 2 days and subjected to DNA array analysis with the Affymetrix Mouse Genome Array 430 2.0, which represents 39,000 transcripts. Because IL-6 treatment leads to down-regulation of endogenous c-myb mRNA, the expression level of c-Myb target genes should be lower in the control M1 cells, relative to the c-Myb-expressing cells. The results indicate that 533 genes are up-regulated more than 5-fold in the c-Myb-expressing cells compared with the control M1 cells (data not shown), and among these, 122 genes were up-regulated more than 10-fold (Fig. 4 and supplemental File 1). These genes may include the direct and indirect Myb target genes and the genes that are regulated as a function of the differentiation process. We then prepared RNAs from the IL-6-treated M1 cells, which constitutively expressed either c-Myb or both c-Myb and p53, and subjected them to micro-array analysis. The results indicate that 628 genes are down-regulated more than 2-fold in the p53-expressing cells, compared with cells lacking p53 (Fig. 4 and supplemental File 2). Comparison of the 122 genes that were induced more than 10-fold in the c-Myb-expressing cells with the 628 genes that were down-regulated by p53 expression identified 28 common genes (Fig. 4, left), indicating that about 23% of the genes, which were induced by c-Myb expression, are negatively regulated by p53. These 28 genes include 9 genes that encode proteins of known function, such as granzyme E, and 19 genes that encode proteins of unknown function (Fig. 4, right, and supplemental File 3). The degree of down-regulation of these genes by p53 expression (2.0–3.7-fold) is relatively low compared with the level of up-regulation by c-Myb expression (10.6–147-fold). This may be due to the relatively low level of p53 expression in the M1 cells (high levels of p53 induced a rapid apoptosis; data not shown). Comparison of the 3,157 genes, which were down-regulated 40% or more by p53 expression, with the 533 genes, which were up-regulated more than 5-fold by constitutive expression of c-Myb, identified 285 genes (53%) in common (data not shown). These include c-myc, which was up-regulated 34.0-fold by constitutive expression of c-Myb and down-regulated 1.8-fold by p53 expression. Thus, a considerable number of c-Myb target genes are negatively regulated by p53. p53 Recruits mSin3A to c-Myb—To investigate the mechanism by which p53 inhibits c-Myb-induced trans-activation, we first examined the effect of p53 on the DNA binding capacity of c-Myb (Fig. 5A). In gel mobility-shift assays, the recombinant R123 protein, which contained only the DBD of c-Myb, bound to the Myb binding site-I probe and generated a retarded band. Addition of GST-p53 to this reaction gave rise to an additional band, whereas GST-p53 alone did not generate a retarded band. An anti-Myb antibody super-shifted both of these bands, whereas anti-p53 antibody only slightly diminished the band generated by addition of GST-p53, possibly due to the low affinity of the p53 antibody to p53 in the complex. Addition of control IgG did not affect either of these bands. These results indicate that p53 interacts with c-Myb bound to the Myb binding site-I DNA, generating a p53-Myb-DNA complex and that p53 does not inhibit the DNA binding of c-Myb. It has been previously reported that p53 represses transcription by recruiting the corepressor mSin3A (13Murphy M. Ahn J. Walker K.K. Hoffman W.H. Evans R.M. Levine A.J. George D.L. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2490-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently found that mSin3A also directly binds to c-Myb and inhibits c-Myb-induced trans-activation (32Nomura T. Tanikawa J. Akimaru H. Kanei-Ishii C. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Khan M.M. Ito H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16715-16726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that p53 may suppress c-Myb-dependent trans-activation by recruiting mSin3A to c-Myb. To investigate this possibility, we first examined the effect of p53 and mSin3A on c-Myb-dependent trans-activation. Co-expression of both p53 and mSin3A resulted in an additive effect on suppression of the c-Myb-dependent transcription from the Myb site containing promoter (Fig. 5B), suggesting that p53 and mSin3A act together to suppress c-Myb-dependent transcription. To examine whether c-Myb, p53, and mSin3A form a complex, a two-step co-immunoprecipitation was performed (Fig. 5C). 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged or untagged c-Myb, and p53. Cell lysates were prepared and first immunoprecipitated with an anti-FLAG antibody. This immunocomplex was eluted with a FLAG peptide and found to contain p53, endogenous mSin3A, and FLAG-c-Myb. The FLAG-peptide eluates were then immunoprecipitated with anti-p53 or control IgG. The anti-p53 immunocomplex contained endogenous mSin3A, but the IgG complex did not. Thus, c-Myb, p53, and mSin3A can form a complex. We then examined the p53-dependent recruitment of mSin3A to the c-myc gene promoter by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. We recently demonstrated that c-Myb binds to the c-myc promoter region using ChIP assays (32Nomura T. Tanikawa J. Akimaru H. Kanei-Ishii C. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Khan M.M. Ito H. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16715-16726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We used M1 cell clones that constitutively express c-Myb and p53ts. Anti-p53 and anti-mSin3A antibodies precipitated the mouse c-myc promoter 343-bp DNA fragment (–782 to –11249), which contains two Myb-binding sites (40Cogswell J.P. Cogswell P.C. Kuehl W.M. Cuddihy A.M. Bender T.M. Engelke U. Marcu K.B. Ting J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2858-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), from cells cultivated at 37 °C (Fig. 5D, left three lanes). Other regions of c-myc DNA, which contained no Myb-binding sites (–705 to –945 and –5 to –235) were not precipitated (data not shown). These results indicate that some amount of p53, which does not have a functional protein conformation, and mSin3A proteins bind to the c-myc promoter region via c-Myb. Activation of p53 by cultivation of cells at 32 °C increased the amounts of c-myc promoter fragment precipitated by anti-p53 and anti-mSin3A antibodies (Fig. 5D, middle three lanes), suggesting that the number of mSin3A molecules that bound to the c-myc promoter increased in p53-overexpressing M1 cells. Thus, p53 recruits mSin3A to the c-myc promoter. Because the c-myc promoter does not contain the consensus p53-binding sequence, p53 is likely to bind to the c-myc promoter via c-Myb. Sumoylation of p53 Suppresses the Interaction with c-Myb— The C-terminal 78-amino acid region of p53, which contains the tetramerization domain directly interacts with c-Myb (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, lysine 386 in this region is known to be sumoylated (41Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6455-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 42Gostissa M. Hengstermann A. Fogal V. Sandy P. Schwarz S.E. Scheffner M. Del Sal G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6462-6471Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). To examine whether the sumoylation of p53 at K386 affects its interaction with c-Myb, we used sumoylated GST-p53 for in vitro binding assays. Bacterially expressed GST-p53 was bound to glutathione beads and incubated with SUMO-1 or SUMO-2 and E1 and E2 enzymes. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that about 90% of GST-p53 was sumoylated (Fig. 6A). These sumoylated GST-p53 and the control non-sumoylated GST-p53 proteins were used for pull-down assays with in vitro-translated c-Myb and mSin3A. Binding efficiency of c-Myb and mSin3A to the sumoylated GST-p53 was about half that of control GST-p53 (Fig. 6B). Thus, sumoylation of p53 suppresses the ability of p53 to inhibit c-Myb-dependent trans-activation. The mechanism by which p53-dependent repression of transcription is translated into cell cycle arrest or induction of apoptosis by p53 is not well understood. The present study indicates that p53 inhibits a group of c-Myb target genes by recruiting mSin3A (Fig. 7). c-Myb induces the expression of various genes that are involved in G1/S progression and suppression of apoptosis, and the induction of these target genes mediates the capacity of c-Myb to induce cell cycle progression and to protect cells against apoptosis. We have identified 28 genes that are up-regulated more than 10-fold by c-Myb expression and down-regulated more than 2-fold by p53. These include Flt3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), which is required for proliferation of immature hematopoietic cells. These results suggest that p53 suppresses multiple c-Myb target genes. We previously showed that p53 induces c-Myb degradation by inducing the ubiquitin E3 ligase Siah-1, which directly binds to c-Myb (33Tanikawa J. Ichikawa-Iwata E. Kanei-Ishii C. Nakai A. Matsuzawa S. Reed J.C. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15578-15585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Therefore, p53 negatively regulates c-Myb activity by two mechanisms; an inhibition of c-Myb-dependent trans-activation by direct binding and by Siah-1-mediated degradation of c-Myb. The former may act immediately after p53 induction, whereas the latter may function in the later stage after Siah-1 induction. In leukemia, colon cancers, and breast cancers where Myb is expressed, p53 is frequently mutated. In addition, it was reported that loss of p53 allows the immortalization of hematopoietic cells by the myc gene, which is a direct target of Myb (43Metz T. Harris A.W. Adams J.M. Cell. 1995; 82: 29-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Together with these reports, our results may support the idea that loss of p53 function in these cases contributes to transformation by up-regulating Myb activity. Because p53 is known to interact with various transcription factors, p53 may repress transcription of additional cell-cycle or apoptosis-related genes by mechanisms similar to those identified here.

Our suggestion that the HR domains are involved in the formation of a coiled-coil heterodimer of TnT and TnI has been recently confirmed by the crystal structure of the core domain of the human cardiac troponin complex. Here we studied a series of recombinant deletion mutants of the fast skeletal TnT to determine the minimal sequence required for stable coiled-coil formation with the HR domain of the fast skeletal TnI. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we measured the α helical content of the coiled-coil formed by the various TnT peptides with TnI HR domain. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments confirmed that the individual peptides of TnT were monomeric but formed heterodimers when mixed with HR domain of TnI. Isothermal titration calorimetry was then used to directly measure the affinity of the TnT peptides for the TnI HR domain. Surprisingly we found that the HR regions alone of the fast skeletal TnT and TnI, as defined earlier, were insufficient to form a coiled-coil. Furthermore we showed that an additional 14 amino acid residues N-terminal to the conserved HR region (TnT residues 165-178) are essential for the stable coiled-coil formation.

The Tm-Tn complex binds polymerized actin to form the regulated thin filament. Actin, Tm, and Tn are present in the thin filament in a ratio of 7:1:1 (2Ebashi S. Endo M. Otsuki J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1969; 2: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Tm is an α helical coiled-coil protein and interacts with another Tm molecule in a head-to-tail manner to form a strand that lies in the groove of the polymerized actin filament (2Ebashi S. Endo M. Otsuki J. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1969; 2: 351-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 3Phillips Jr., G.N. Fillers J.P. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). The Tn complex is composed of three structurally and functionally different proteins: troponin C (TnC), which binds to Ca2+; troponin I (TnI), which binds to actin; and troponin T (TnT), which binds to Tm. In the relaxed muscle, TnI inhibits the ATPase activity of actomyosin by binding to actin and blocking the actin-myosin interaction (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar, 4Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 5Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit.

In the excited muscle, depolarization of muscle membrane releases Ca2+ in the sarcoplasm, and the binding of this Ca2+ to TnC leads to a conformational change in TnC. This initiates muscle contraction through a process of “information transfer.” Subsequent steps involve multiprotein interactions and conformational changes in the thin filament leading to the contraction of muscle. The information transfer during muscle contraction presumably follows the order: TnC → TnI → TnT → Tm → actin (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar, 4Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 5Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit.

All of the subunits of the Tn complex participate in binary and ternary interactions, and these play a critical role in the Ca2+ regulation of the muscle contraction. The natures of these interactions as well as the factors that influence them are key for understanding the contraction mechanism (1Gordon A.M. Homsher E. Regnier M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 853-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar, 4Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 5Leavis P.C. Gergely J. CRC Crit.

The involvement of TnT is particularly important in the regulatory system as TnT interacts with TnI, TnC, Tm, and actin (7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). TnT anchors the whole Tn complex to the thin filament by interacting with the Tm head-to-tail overlapping region and thus plays a major structural role (3Phillips Jr., G.N. Fillers J.P. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Another function of TnT is to increase the cooperativity of the actin-Tm interaction. It is also required for the allosteric signal transduction in sensitizing the actin-activated myosin ATPase to the concentration of Ca2+ (8Schaertl S. Lehrer S.S.

Fast skeletal TnT (fsTnT) can be cleaved by proteolytic digestion into two halves: TnT1 (residues 1-157) and TnT2 (residues 158-258) (7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Interestingly most of the biological activities and the sites of interactions of TnT with other thin filament proteins are located on these two fragments separately (7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res.

Genom. 2003; 4: 609-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The TnT1 fragment is mainly involved in the interaction with Tm, whereas the TnT2 fragment, which is located in the regulatory “globular” head of the Tn complex, is involved in the interactions with TnC and TnI (7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). TnT residues 235-250 have been suggested to interact with TnC (7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 575-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 17Blumenschein T.M. Tripet B.P. Hodges R.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36606-36612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and residues 178-250 have been implicated as the TnI interaction region (7Perry S.V. J. Muscle Res.

Chem. 1998; 273: 10594-10601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This latter region contains an evolutionarily conserved region (residues 179-241), previously identified by us, with heptad hydrophobic repeats (HRs), known for their ability to form coiled-coil structures (18Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 19Pearlstone J.R. Smillie L.B. Can. J. Biochem. 1985; 63: 212-218Google Scholar). A similar region, presumably derived from a common ancestor gene, is also present in TnI (residues 58-114) (20Perry S.V. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on point and deletion mutagenesis of the HR region of fsTnT and loss of interaction with fsTnI using the yeast two-hybrid assay, it was suggested that these regions of TnT and TnI form a heterodimeric α helical coiled-coil (18Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A recent report of the crystal structure of the core domain of the human cardiac Tn complex, comprising cardiac TnC and the C-terminal fragments of cardiac TnI and TnT, confirmed these interactions (21Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure, residues 226-271 of cTnT makes an α helical coiled-coil with residues 90-135 of cTnI. The importance of the heterodimeric coiled-coil region as a major structural domain in the Tn complex is evident from the crystal structure of the cardiac Tn core complex. But an understanding of the details, particularly how this region in the fast skeletal isoform plays a role in the binary interaction with TnI, is limited due to lack of any crystal structure of the fast skeletal isoform. To gain further insight into the TnT-TnI interaction, in the present study we examined the parameters of the heterodimeric coiled-coil formation of the fast skeletal Tn isoform using recombinant peptides made from TnT and TnI. We constructed fsTnT fragments encompassing the region between amino acid residues 158-258 and examined their ability to form a coiled-coil with TnI HR. We showed that whereas a TnT fragment containing only the HR region forms a weak coiled-coil with the HR region of TnI, a TnT fragment containing the additional amino acid residues 165-178, N-terminal to the HR region, forms a much stronger coiled-coil. It was concluded that a region outside the HR domain of fsTnT is critically required for the stability of this interaction. Materials—Common reagents and buffer components were purchased from Sigma unless mentioned otherwise. PCR reagents were from Roche Applied Science, and oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The DNA purification kit, gel elution kit, and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose used for protein purification were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Constructions of Plasmids for Expression of Recombinant Peptides—Oligonucleotides for the construction of the TnT2 and its deletion mutants were designed based on the human fast skeletal troponin T β cDNA sequence (22Wu Q.L. Jha P.K. Raychowdhury M.K. Du Y. Leavis P.C. Sarkar S. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) that was cloned into the pET-28a expression vector. Primers were designed so that the 5′ primers contained an NdeI restriction site and the 3′ primers contained an XhoI restriction site. Primers 1 (5′-ACTACAGCCATATGCTGGCCAAGGC-3′) and 2 (5′-CTGCTCGAGCTACTTCCAGCGCC-3′) were used to PCR-amplify the TnT2 region. Primers 3 (5′-TGAAGAAGCATATGCTGGCTGAGAGAC-3′) and 4 (5′-AGCCTCGAGTTAGTGCTTCTGGGCCTG-3′) were used for amplifying the HR region. Primer pairs 1/4 and 2/3 were used for amplifying the region corresponding to the TnT-(158-241) and TnT-(179-258), respectively. Primer 5 (5′-AGGCTGACCATATGAGAGGCAAGAAG-3′) and primer 4 were used for amplification of the TnT-(165-241) region. In a similar way, primer 6 (5′-AGAAGCAGCATATGCGAGAGATGAAG-3′) and primer 4 were used for amplifying the region corresponding to TnT-(172-241). Primer 5 was used with primer 7 (5′-GGCCTCGAGTTAGCGGCTCCTGAGCG-3′) and primer 8 (5′-GATCTCGAGTTAGTCATATTTCTGGCG-3′) for amplifications of TnT-(165-234) and TnT-(165-227) regions, respectively. After the PCRs, the products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and subsequently cloned into pET-28a expression vector, previously digested with the same NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes. A rabbit fast skeletal TnI cDNA (23Wu Q.L. Raychowdhury M.K. Du Y. Jha P.K. Leavis P.C. Sarkar S. J. DNA Sequencing Mapping. 1993; 4: 113-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was subcloned into pET-28a. A fragment corresponding to amino acids 57-112 was PCR-amplified using primers 9 (5′-TCCCCGGCCATATGGCCGAGGTGC-3′) and 10 (5′-CATCTCGAGCTACCGCAGCGGGGGCCTC-3′). After the PCR, the products were digested with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into pET-28a in the same way as above. All the subcloned constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Peptides—For production of the recombinant peptides, constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells and were grown in a LB medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin and chloramphenicol overnight at 37 °C. One liter of LB medium containing the same antibiotics was then inoculated with 20 ml of the overnight culture, and the cells were grown at 37 °C until the OD reached 0.5, and then 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added. To facilitate selective production of plasmid-encoded proteins, rifampicin was added at 50 μg/ml 30 min after the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were then grown for 5 h, harvested by centrifugation, and stored at -80 °C. Bacterial cells containing the various His-tagged peptides were lysed using the freeze-thaw technique. The peptides were recovered from the inclusion bodies by solubilization in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 8 m urea) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected. 10 ml of 50% (w/v) nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose, previously equilibrated in the same buffer, was then added to the supernatant and incubated at room temperature for 2 h with rotation. The material was then transferred to a column and washed sequentially with buffer B, then with buffer B containing 10 mm imidazole, and with buffer B containing 20 mm imidazole. His-tagged peptides were eluted from the column by a wash with buffer B containing 250 mm imidazole. The eluted peptides in denaturing buffer were then subjected to renaturation by step dialysis. Typically 15 ml of the peptide solution was packed into a Spectrapore dialysis bag and dialyzed for 10 h stepwise in three buffers containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, and 4, 2, and 0 m urea, respectively. For the separation of the His tag from the peptides, when necessary, the Biotinylated Thrombin kit (Novagen) was used following the manufacturer's protocol. The cleaved His tag was separated from the solution by passing the reaction mixture through a DG 10 column (Bio-Rad). Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) fitted with a Peltier temperature controller. The instrument was calibrated with an aqueous solution of d-10-(+)-camphor sulfonic acid at 290.5 nm. Samples were extensively dialyzed in a 10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaF, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.5 buffer before the measurements. All spectra measurements were recorded at 5 °C. Data were recorded at 0.2-nm intervals from 270 to 190 nm at a scanning speed of 2 nm/min. A 1-mm path length quartz cell was used for the measurements. For all runs, the base line was corrected by subtracting a spectrum of the buffer from the spectrum of the protein. Secondary structure analysis was performed using the Selcon2 program (24Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). For temperature denaturation studies, ellipticity was recorded at 222 nm as the temperature was increased from 0 to 75 °C at a rate of 2 °C/min (25Cooper T.M. Woody R.W. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 657-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The Tm values were extracted by fitting the thermal denaturation data to Equation 1, θ=fMθM+(1−fM)θD where fM is the fraction of monomer and θM and θD are the ellipticities of the monomer and dimer, respectively. The natural temperature dependence of the base-line slope was included by defining θM and θD = θ(M or D)0 K + mT, i.e. the value at 0 K plus a temperature dependence, m. fM for a bimolecular dissociation is obtained from Kd=[M] 2/[D]=2fM2[P]/(1−fM) where [P] is the total molar protein concentration. Rearranging the above equation gives Equation 2, fM=−Kd+Kd2+8[P]Kd4[P] Kd is related to Tm by substituting the integrated van't Hoff Equation 3 into Equation 2, Kd=[P]exp[ΔHvHR(1Tm−1T)] Equation 3 is valid if the difference between the heat capacities of the dimer and monomer (ΔCp) is small. Fitted parameters were θD0 K, θM0 K, ΔHvH, Tm, and m (26Dutta K. Alexandrov A. Huang H. Pascal S.M. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2531-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Tm values were checked by differentiating the data with respect to temperature and fitting it to the equation after application of a three-point smoothing window, dθ/dT=AfM(1−fM)T2 where A is a scaling factor (27John D.M. Weeks K.M. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1416-1419Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This determines the point of inflection and is effective even when the thermal denaturation curves are incomplete. The Tm values reported are the average of two independent experiments, and the Tm values did not differ by more than 1 °C between the experiments. Sedimentation Equilibrium Analysis—Sedimentation equilibrium ultracentrifugation was performed on a Beckman Coulter Optima X-LA model analytical ultracentrifuge using an eight-hole An-50Ti rotor. Samples were extensively dialyzed against a 10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm βME, pH 7.5 buffer, and centrifugation runs were performed in the same buffer. All experiments were performed at 5 °C at various speeds between 25,000 and 50,000 rpm. Double sector cells were filled with 250 μl of samples giving a column height of ∼5 mm, and the data were recorded at 230 nm with a radial increment of 0.001 cm with 16 replicates. Scans were taken every 2 h during the approach of equilibrium. The attainment of equilibrium was verified using the WinMatch program. Data analysis was carried out with the equilibrium data fitter, which is a part of the program SEDANAL (28Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), using the non-linear least square method to fit globally to multiple data sets. The goodness of fit was determined by a minimum root mean square deviation comparable to the noise on the data and by randomly varying residuals. The partial specific volume of each peptide was calculated using the program SEDNTERP from the amino acid composition, and the solvent density was calculated using known values from physical tables also using SEDNTERP. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—ITC experiments were performed using a VPITC calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). Samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in a 10 mm Tris-HCl, 300 NaCl, 1 mm βME, pH 7.5 buffer before the experiments. All experiments were performed at 5 °C. The sample cell was filled with a ∼10 μm solution of TnI HR (volume, 1.4 ml), and the TnT fragments (10 times more concentrated) were titrated into the cell from the 300-μl syringe while stirring at 300 rpm. A typical experiment consisted of 28 successive automatic injections of 10 μl each with 180-s equilibration time between the injections. The first injection consisted of 2 μl and was ignored in the final data analysis. The heat change for the dilution of the ligand injections was measured by injecting the TnT2 fragments into the buffer under identical conditions and was subtracted from the measured heat change of ligand binding to protein. Data analysis was performed using the least square method with the Origin-based software provided by the manufacturer to determine the equilibrium binding constant (KA), the enthalpy of the complex formation (ΔH), and the entropy (ΔS) of the reaction. All the reported thermodynamic parameters were calculated by averaging parameters obtained from at least two independent experiments, and the range of their values are also indicated. Modeling of the Coiled-coil Domain—A model for the HR region of the fast skeletal TnI/TnI heterodimer was created from the x-ray crystal structure of the cardiac Tn core domain complex (21Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). Manual alignment of the sequences gave 57% identity in TnI and 62% identity in TnT. Residues 165-168 of fsTnT were given extended conformations because there was no electron density in the crystal structure for the corresponding residues of cTnT. Where needed, side chains were converted from those of cTnI/TnT to fsTnI/TnI using the Biopolymer module of InsightII (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA). Graphical representation was made using InsightII. Design of the Peptides—Recombinant peptides corresponding to residues 179-241 in fsTnT and residues 57-112 in fsTnI were made to examine the hypothesis that the conserved HR domains are involved in coiled-coil formation (18Stefancsik R. Jha P.K. Sarkar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The peptides used to define the region of fsTnT involved in the formation of a stable TnT-TnI heterodimer are schematically represented in Fig. 1. Residues 193-238 of fsTnT HR and residues 58-103 of fsTnI HR correspond to the amino acid residues 226-271 and 90-135 of the cardiac TnT and TnI isoform, respectively, which are observed to form a heterodimeric coiled-coil in the crystal structure of the human cardiac troponin core complex (21Takeda S. Yamashita A. Maeda K. Maeda Y. Nature. 2003; 424: 35-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). To determine whether these skeletal Tn residues were sufficient for coiled-coil formation, we began with TnT2 (amino acid residues 158-258) and examined various deletion mutants. TnT-(158-241) and TnT-(179-258) were made to determine the effect of additional amino acid residues at the C-terminal and N-terminal ends of the HR region, respectively. The TnT2 sequence contains three imperfect heptads between residues 158 and 178. TnT-(165-241) and TnT-(172-241) containing deletions of these imperfect heptads were designed. Also two C-terminal deletion mutants TnT-(165-234) and TnT-(165-227), containing deletions of one and two heptads, respectively, inside the HR region of TnT, were made to determine their role in the coiled-coil interaction. Unlike TnT, TnI does not contain additional heptad repeats outside the conserved HR domain, and therefore only the TnI HR peptide was used for studying the coiled-coil interaction with all the TnT2 fragments. Secondary Structural Analysis by Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—Since coiled-coil formation is dependent on the α helical characteristics of the interacting peptides, CD spectroscopic analysis was used to determine the secondary structural properties of the peptides. The CD spectra of TnT HR, TnT2, and TnI HR are illustrated in Fig. 2. The TnT HR spectrum showed negative ellipticities around 222 and 208 nm, characteristic of proteins with helical content but also containing other secondary structures. The TnT2 spectrum also showed similar characteristics, although the amount of α helicity was slightly lower. The TnI HR spectrum, on the other hand, showed a broad minimum around 205 nm and lacked a well defined minimum around 222 nm. Secondary structure estimates are summarized in Table I.Table ISecondary structural properties and stability of the peptides and their mixturesSpecies nameα helixβ sheetOtherTotalaSecondary structural content was determined using the Selcon2 program.θ222:θ208bθ222:θ208 value is an indicator of the coiled-coil state of the interacting peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2150810988,"The strict dependence of transcription from the aidB promoter (PaidB) on the EσS form of RNA polymerase is because of the presence of a C nucleotide as the first residue of the –10 promoter sequence (–12C), which does not allow an open complex formation by Eσ70. In this report, σ70 mutants carrying either the Q437H or the T440I single amino acid substitutions, which allow –12C recognition by σ70, were tested for their ability to carry out transcription from PaidB. The Gln-437 and Thr-440 residues are located in region 2.4 of σ70 and correspond to Gln-152 and Glu-155 in σS. Interestingly, the Q437H mutant of σ70, but not T440I, was able to promote an open complex formation and to initiate transcription at PaidB. In contrast to T440I, a T440E mutant was proficient in carrying out transcription from PaidB. No σ70 mutant displayed significantly increased interaction with a PaidB mutant in which the –12C was substituted by a T (PaidB(C12T)), which is also efficiently recognized by wild type σ70. The effect of the T440E mutation suggests that the corresponding Glu-155 residue in σS might be involved in –12C recognition. However, substitution to alanine of the Glu-155 residue, as well as of Gln-152, in the σS protein did not significantly affect EσS interaction with PaidB. Our results reiterate the importance of the –12C residue for σS-specific promoter recognition and strongly suggest that interaction with the –10 sequence and open complex formation are carried out by different determinants in the two σ factors.

The sigma (σ) subunits are responsible for the sequence-specific binding, correct promoter recognition, and transcription initiation by bacterial RNA polymerase. Seven different σ subunits have been identified in Escherichia coli; σ70 is the main σ subunit during active growth and σ70-associated RNA polymerase (Eσ70) carries out transcription from the majority of E. coli promoters. Alternative σ subunits (e.g. σH, σN) direct transcription toward specific sets of genes, often in response to cellular stresses, by promoting RNA polymerase binding to promoter sequences that strongly diverge from σ70 consensus (1Lange R. Hengge-Aronis R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1600-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 2Jishage M. Ishihama A. J.

However, the alternative σS subunit, the product of the rpoS gene and mainly expressed in stationary phase of growth, can recognize similar promoter sequences and thus initiate transcription from several σ70-dependent promoters (4Tanaka K. Takayanagi Y. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Takahashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3511-3515Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recognition of similar promoter sequences by σ70 and σS is reflected by their strong similarity in the DNA binding domains (5Lonetto M. Gribskov M. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) and would be consistent with the need of the cell to continue expressing housekeeping genes in physiological conditions that simultaneously result in σS accumulation and inhibition of σ70-dependent transcription, such as accumulation of intracellular guanosine tetraphosphate concentrations because of amino acid starvation (6Gentry D.R.

Likewise, the search for an optimal promoter for EσS in vitro using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment procedure has led to the proposal of CTATA(c/a)T as the –10 consensus sequence for EσS (13Gaal T. Ross W. Estrem S.T. Nguyen L.H. Burgess R.R. Gourse R.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 42: 939-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This approach also resulted in the identification of TTGACA, i.e. the consensus –35 promoter element for Eσ70, as the optimal –35 sequence for EσS. These results suggest that promoter selectivity between σ70 and σS might be determined by different tolerance toward deviations from a common consensus sequence. In addition, factors independent of DNA sequence such as intracellular salt concentration, degree of DNA supercoiling, the guanosine tetraphosphate alarmone, and modulation by trans-acting regulatory proteins would help determine selective promoter recognition (14Hengge-Aronis R. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 148-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Hengge-Aronis R. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 4: 341-346PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hengge-Aronis R. Curr.

A sequence feature important for σS-specific promoter recognition is a C nucleotide immediately upstream of the –10 promoter element (CTATA(c/a)T) and conventionally placed at the –13 position relative to the transcription start (–13C) (13Gaal T.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the σS-dependent osmE and csiD promoters have confirmed the importance of the –13C element for efficient σS-dependent transcription (11Becker G. Hengge-Aronis R. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1153-1165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bordes P. Repoila F. Kolb A. Gutierrez C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the –13C nucleotide is an important determinant for EσS-dependent transcription at the aidB promoter, (24Lacour S. Kolb A. Zehnder A.J. Landini P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) the major determinant for EσS selectivity is the presence of a C nucleotide as first nucleotide of the –10 hexamer (–12C); indeed, its substitution to a T, canonical for the –10 element σ70-dependent promoters, results in loss of specific aidB promoter recognition by EσS (24Lacour S. Kolb A. Zehnder A.J. Landini P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The presence of a C as the first nucleotide of the –10 sequence is also responsible for specific recognition by σS at the osmE (23Bordes P. Repoila F. Kolb A. Gutierrez C. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 845-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) as well at the csgB and sprE2 promoters (33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, although σ70 displays a strict requirement for a thymidine as the first nucleotide of the –10 sequence, σS appears to be able to recognize either pyrimidine.The amino acids contacting the –10 promoter element are located in region 2.4 of σ70 (25Siegele D.A.

Biol. 1998; 63: 141-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), and the DNA-protein interaction appears to involve numerous residues between the 425 and 451 positions (31Fenton M.S. Lee S.J. Gralla J.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1130-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Suppression genetics studies have identified two mutations, which allow recognition by σ70 of a C nucleotide at position –12 at mutant lac and ant promoters (25Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Both mutations are single amino acid substitutions at position 437 (a glutamine to a histidine, Q437H) and at position 440 (a threonine to an isoleucine, T440I). In region 2.4 of σS, the amino acids at the corresponding positions are Gln-152 and Glu-155. Interestingly, both these residues have recently been implicated in σS interaction with the –13C element at the osmE and fic promoters (32Checroun C. Bordes P. Leroy O. Kolb A. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In this work we have investigated the ability of mutant σ70 proteins at residues Gln-437 and Thr-440 to recognize a C as first nucleotide of the –10 element in the context of the strictly σS-dependent aidB promoter. We show that both the Q437H and the T440E mutations allow efficient transcription initiation from the aidB promoter by Eσ70 through improved recognition of the C nucleotide at position –12 (first nucleotide in the –10 promoter element). However, substitutions of the corresponding Gln-152 and Glu-155 amino acids in σS did not affect aidB promoter recognition, thus suggesting that interaction with the –10 promoter element might be carried out by different determinants in either σS or σ70.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Vectors—The plasmids carrying either the wild type aidB promoter (PaidB) 1The abbreviations used are: PaidB, aidB promoter; WT, wild type. or its PaidB(C12T) derivative were obtained from the pJCD01 vector as described previously (33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To generate 12-histidine-tagged mutants of σ70, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of the RpoD allele in the plasmid pET-21σ (34Rhodius V.A. Busby S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 311-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. For this purpose, we used the following couples of mutagenic primers, Q437H_F, 5′-CCTGGTGGATCCGTCAtGCGATCACCCGCTC-3′ and Q437H_R, 5′-GAGCGGGTGATCGCaTGACGGATCCACCAGG-3′; T440I_F, 5′-CCGTCAGGCGATCAtCCGCTCTATCGCGG-3′ and T440I_R, 5′-CCGCGATAGAGCGGaTGATCGCCTGACGG-3′; T440E_F, 5′-CCGTCAGGCGATCgagCGCTCTATCGCGG-3′ and T440E_R, 5′-CCGCGATAGAGCGctcGATCGCCTGACGG-3′, to develop the σ70(Q437H), σ70(T440I), and σ70(T440E) mutant proteins, respectively (substitutions are indicated in lowercase italic characters). The correct sequences of the so-obtained plasmids were verified by sequencing using the primer int-RpoD 5′-GGTTGAAGCGAACTTACGTCTGG-3′. The Q152A and E155A σS mutants were obtained through an introduction of the appropriate nucleotide substitutions in the rpoS gene as described in Ref. 32Checroun C. Bordes P. Leroy O. Kolb A. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar.Protein Purification and Holoenzyme Reconstitution—Core enzyme and σ factors were purified as described previously (32Checroun C. Bordes P. Leroy O. Kolb A. Gutierrez C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 34Rhodius V.A. Busby S.J. J. Mol.

Gene (Amst.). 1983; 26: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); proteins appeared to be pure from contaminants as determined by denaturing protein gel electrophoresis (data not shown). Reconstitution of active holoenzymes for the different experiments was achieved by incubating the core enzyme and either σS or σ70 (either wild type or mutant) at a 1:4 ratio (to ensure saturation of the core enzyme) for 30 min at 37 °C. For the competition experiment in a bandshift assay, the σ70:σS:core ratio was reduced to 1, and reconstitution time was reduced to 10 min. The reconstituted holoenzymes were diluted at room temperature in K-glu200 buffer (40 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 4 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 μg/ml bovine serum albumin) prior to their use for in vitro experiments. Dithiothreitol was omitted from the buffer for permanganate (KMnO4) reactivity experiments.Binding and Transcription Assays—Single-round transcription assays were performed on derivatives of the supercoiled plasmid pJCDO1 (37Sanderson A. Mitchell J.E. Minchin S.D. Busby S.J. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) carrying either PaidB or its PaidB(C12T) mutant derivative, as described in Ref. 33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar. Plasmids (3 nm) and reconstituted RNA polymerase holoenzymes (50 nm) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in K-glu200 buffer to allow the RNA polymerase-promoter complex formation. Elongation was started by the addition of a prewarmed mixture containing nucleotides and heparin (final concentrations were 500 μm ATP, GTP, and CTP; 30 μm UTP; 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP; and 500 μg/ml heparin) to the template-polymerase mix and allowed to proceed for 10 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of loading buffer (formamide containing 20 mm EDTA, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue). After heating to 65 °C, samples were loaded on 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gels. Reaction products from PaidB were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and normalized to the standard RNA-I product after background subtraction.Linear DNA fragments (–128 to +52 of either PaidB or PaidB(C12T)) generated by PCR using the primers 5′-aidBbam (5′-GGATCCGTGAAGATAACACACTG-3′) and 3′-aidB+52 (5′-AAAACGGTGTGAGTTTGCCAGTGC-3′, labeled by 5′-phosphorylation using phage T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP) were used for gel mobility shift assays, DNase I protection experiments, and KMnO4 reactivity assays. The template strand was labeled.For gel mobility shift assays, the reconstituted holoenzyme (7.5–50 nm) and the 180-bp promoter DNA fragments (1 nm) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in K-glu200 buffer in a final reaction volume of 10 μl. The reaction mixture was then loaded onto a native 5% polyacrylamide gel after the addition of 2.5 μl of loading buffer (50% sucrose, 0.025% xylene cyanol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 150 μg/ml heparin).For DNase I footprinting, reconstituted RNA polymerase (100 nm) was incubated with either PaidB or PaidB(C12T) (4 nm) for 30 min at 37 °C in K-glu200 buffer. Protein-free DNA samples were treated with 1 μg/ml DNase I for 20 s, whereas the incubation was prolonged to 30 s in the presence of RNA polymerase. After the addition of loading buffer containing 150 μg/ml heparin, the samples were separated on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel, and the bands corresponding to the RNA polymerase-promoter complexes were eluted from the gel, precipitated, and resuspended in EDTA (20 mm)-formamide buffer before being loaded on a 7% polyacrylamide sequencing gel.KMnO4 reactivity experiments were performed as described (36Colland F. Barth M. Hengge-Aronis R. Kolb A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3028-3037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 nm RNA polymerase and promoters were incubated in K-glu200 (without dithiothreitol) for 15 min at 37 °C; KMnO4 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm, and the reaction was stopped after 30 s by adding 2-mercaptoethanol to a final concentration of 330 mm. The KMnO4-reactive bands were expressed as a percentage of the total labeled DNA loaded onto the gel.RESULTSIn Vitro Transcription at the PaidB with RNA Polymerase Assembled with Mutant σ70 Proteins—In a previous work, we have shown that the presence of a cytosine (–12C) as the first nucleotide of the aidB –10 promoter element (CATACT) is the main determinant for specific PaidB promoter recognition by σS-RNA polymerase (EσS). Substitutions of the –12C to a thymine nucleotide results in a near-consensus –10 sequence for σ70 (TATACT) and allows efficient promoter recognition by Eσ70 (33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Mutations in σ70 have been described that allow transcription initiation from mutant lac and ant promoters in which the T at position –12 had been substituted to a C (Plac(T12C), Pant(T12C)); these mutant promoters are no longer recognized by wild type σ70-RNA polymerase (Eσ70) (25Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We tested whether these mutations would also confer the ability to carry out transcription at the aidB promoter, i.e. in a σS-dependent promoter context. In addition to the already characterized Q437H and T440I mutants, we constructed a T440E mutant σ70 protein, in which the threonine at position 440 of σ70 was substituted to a glutamate, i.e. to the corresponding amino acid residue in σS (Glu-155). The different forms of RNA polymerase assembled with the three σ70 mutants were tested in experiments of in vitro transcription on supercoiled templates and compared with wild type Eσ70 and EσS (Fig. 1A). Both the Q437H and T440E mutants were more efficient (roughly 4-fold, Fig. 1B) than wild type σ70 in carrying out transcription from wild type PaidB; in contrast, the T440I mutation did not improve aidB transcription significantly (1.2-fold). Stimulation of transcription initiation by the Q437H and T440E mutations appears to specifically depend on increased recognition of the –12C. Indeed, transcription from the mutant aidB promoter in which the –12C has been substituted to a T (PaidB(C12T)) was carried out at roughly the same extent by wild type and mutant Eσ70s (Fig. 1). Although the C to T mutation at position –12 also stimulated EσS-dependent transcription, the EσS:Eσ70 ratio in transcription initiation was reduced from 9-fold at PaidB to 3-fold at PaidB(C12T) (Fig. 1B), consistent with previous observations (33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Gel Retardation and DNase I Protection Experiments—Transcription initiation is a complex process that takes place in at least three distinct steps, binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter sequence, formation of the so-called “open complex,” and promoter escape. At the aidB promoter, interaction with Eσ70 is limited at the open complex formation step (24Lacour S. Kolb A. Zehnder A.J. Landini P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the ability of the Q437H, T440E, and T440I σ70 mutants to form heparin-resistant complexes and to promote open complex formation at PaidB. Fig. 2 shows the results of gel retardation assays performed in the presence of heparin. Both the Eσ70(Q437H) and the Eσ70(T440E) forms of RNA polymerase were able to promote formation of heparin-resistant complexes with PaidB, in contrast to Eσ70(WT) and Eσ70(T440I), and consistent with the results of the in vitro transcription experiments (Fig. 1A). As expected, both wild type and mutant Eσ70s were able to promote efficient heparin-resistant complex formation at the PaidB(C12T) promoter (Fig. 1B).Fig. 2A, gel retardation assays in the presence of heparin using σ70 mutant proteins on either PaidB (top) or PaidB(C12T) (bottom). Holoenzyme concentrations were 0, 7.5, 15, and 50 nm (from left to right), and the σ factors:core RNA polymerase ratio was 2:1. PaidB-RNA polymerase complexes were separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gel and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. B, dashed lines with closed squares (▪) = Eσ70(WT); solid lines with open symbols: triangles (▵), Eσ70(Q437H), circles (○), Eσ70(T440E), diamonds (⋄), Eσ70(T440I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The heparin-resistant complexes were probed with DNase I to gather more detailed information on the specific RNA polymerase-promoter interactions. Consistent with the results of the previous assays, both the Eσ70(Q437H) and the Eσ70(T440E) forms of RNA polymerase, but not Eσ70(WT) and Eσ70(T440I), were able to protect the aidB promoter region from DNase I attack (Fig. 3A). The extent and the pattern of protection by Eσ70(Q437H) and Eσ70(T440E) were similar to EσS; however, subtle differences in the pattern of DNase I-hypersensitive bands by EσS and Eσ70 could be detected in the region around and immediately upstream from the –35 element. Binding by both forms of RNA polymerase results in the appearance of DNase I-hypersensitive bands in both the –35 to –39 and in the –46 to –50 regions of PaidB. However, although binding by EσS results in DNase I hypersensitivity mainly at –36 and –46 positions, binding by Eσ70 results in even stronger hypersensitive bands at –38 and –48 (Fig. 3A, shown by arrows). An identical DNase I-hypersensitivity pattern in the –35 region is induced by both wild type and mutant Eσ70s at the PaidB(C12T) promoter (Fig. 3B), suggesting that both the Q437H and the T440E mutations specifically result in increased interaction with the –10 promoter region, without affecting Eσ70-promoter contacts in the –35 region.Fig. 3DNase I protection experiment after heparin challenge.

Numbers at the right side indicate the position of nucleotides according to the transcription start site as determined from the A + G sequencing reactions. The template strand is shown. The gray solid line indicates the area most strongly protected by either form of RNA polymerase. DNase I-hypersensitive sites in the –35 and –50 areas are shown by arrows. Data are from a typical experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)KMnO4 Reactivity Experiments—To directly assess the effect of the σ70 mutations on the open complex formation step of transcription initiation, we performed KMnO4 reactivity experiments on the wild type and mutant Eσ70s. The results clearly showed that both the Q437H and T440E mutations, but not T440I, allow Eσ70 to carry out promoter opening at PaidB (Fig. 4). The extension of the KMnO4-reactive region, which corresponds to the single-stranded DNA region induced by open complex formation by RNA polymerase, as well as its intensity (Fig. 4B) is very similar for both the Eσ70 mutants and for EσS. The KMnO4 reactivity induced by Eσ70 mutants encompasses the +2 position, which defines an open complex fully competent for transcription initiation at PaidB (24Lacour S. Kolb A. Zehnder A.J. Landini P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 922-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Lacour S. Kolb A. Landini P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37160-37168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As expected, both wild type and mutant Eσ70s were fully capable of open complex formation at PaidB(C12T), consistent with the results of the in vitro transcription assays (Fig. 1).Fig. 4A, KMnO4 reactivity of the –10 region on the template strand of either PaidB or P(C12T)aidB mutant with holoenzymes containing σ70 (black labels) or σS (gray labels) mutants (50 nm Eσ).

A typical experiment is shown, two repeats of the experiment gave very similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Thus, our results showed that mutations in the Gln-437 and Thr-440 amino acid residues of σ70 increase promoter recognition and open complex formation at PaidB, consistent with increased promoter recognition of Plac(T12C) and Pant(T12C) (25Siegele D.A. Hu J.C. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 591-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Waldburger C. Gardella T. Wong R. Susskind M.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although Gln-437 also corresponds to a glutamine residue in σS (Gln-152), the position corresponding to Thr-440 in σS is a glutamic acid (Glu-155). Thus, the observation that the T440E, but not the T440I, mutation allows PaidB recognition by Eσ70 would suggest that Glu-155 is directly involved in the interaction with the –12C residue by EσS. To address this possibility, we performed KMnO4 reactivity experiments with RNA polymerase assembled with a σS mutant in which the glutamic acid at position 155 had been substituted to an alanine (E155A). In addition, a σS Q152A mutant was also tested. As shown in Fig. 4, neither σS mutant was affected in open complex formation at either PaidB or PaidB(C12T). To test whether either the E155A or the Q152A mutations could affect steps in transcription initiation other than open complex formation, we performed in vitro transcription experiments on supercoiled templates. The results clearly showed that both mutant σS proteins could carry out transcription from the aidB promoter when assembled into RNA polymerase at least as efficiently as wild type σS (Fig. 5).Fig. 5Run-off transcription experiments from PaidB wild type on supercoiled template using EσS derivatives (50 nm). A typical experiment is shown on the left panel. The average of the densitometric analysis from three independent experiments is presente"
