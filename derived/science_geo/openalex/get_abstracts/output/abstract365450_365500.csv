https://openalex.org/W1968127700,"We show that the nuclear architecture of rod photoreceptor cells differs fundamentally in nocturnal and diurnal mammals. The rods of diurnal retinas possess the conventional architecture found in nearly all eukaryotic cells, with most heterochromatin situated at the nuclear periphery and euchromatin residing toward the nuclear interior. The rods of nocturnal retinas have a unique inverted pattern, where heterochromatin localizes in the nuclear center, whereas euchromatin, as well as nascent transcripts and splicing machinery, line the nuclear border. The inverted pattern forms by remodeling of the conventional one during terminal differentiation of rods. The inverted rod nuclei act as collecting lenses, and computer simulations indicate that columns of such nuclei channel light efficiently toward the light-sensing rod outer segments. Comparison of the two patterns suggests that the conventional architecture prevails in eukaryotic nuclei because it results in more flexible chromosome arrangements, facilitating positional regulation of nuclear functions."
https://openalex.org/W2028645759,"The characterization of topological architecture of complex brain networks is one of the most challenging issues in neuroscience. Slow (<0.1 Hz), spontaneous fluctuations of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging are thought to be potentially important for the reflection of spontaneous neuronal activity. Many studies have shown that these fluctuations are highly coherent within anatomically or functionally linked areas of the brain. However, the underlying topological mechanisms responsible for these coherent intrinsic or spontaneous fluctuations are still poorly understood. Here, we apply modern network analysis techniques to investigate how spontaneous neuronal activities in the human brain derived from the resting-state BOLD signals are topologically organized at both the temporal and spatial scales. We first show that the spontaneous brain functional networks have an intrinsically cohesive modular structure in which the connections between regions are much denser within modules than between them. These identified modules are found to be closely associated with several well known functionally interconnected subsystems such as the somatosensory/motor, auditory, attention, visual, subcortical, and the “default” system. Specifically, we demonstrate that the module-specific topological features can not be captured by means of computing the corresponding global network parameters, suggesting a unique organization within each module. Finally, we identify several pivotal network connectors and paths (predominantly associated with the association and limbic/paralimbic cortex regions) that are vital for the global coordination of information flow over the whole network, and we find that their lesions (deletions) critically affect the stability and robustness of the brain functional system. Together, our results demonstrate the highly organized modular architecture and associated topological properties in the temporal and spatial brain functional networks of the human brain that underlie spontaneous neuronal dynamics, which provides important implications for our understanding of how intrinsically coherent spontaneous brain activity has evolved into an optimal neuronal architecture to support global computation and information integration in the absence of specific stimuli or behaviors."

An upsurge of research now reveals new principles of BAR domain-mediated membrane remodeling, enhancing our understanding of membrane curvature-mediated information processing. Membrane-shaping proteins of the BAR domain superfamily are determinants of organelle biogenesis, membrane trafficking, cell division, and cell migration. An upsurge of research now reveals new principles of BAR domain-mediated membrane remodeling, enhancing our understanding of membrane curvature-mediated information processing. Walls, fences, and barriers: these are the metaphors often used to describe the properties of cellular membranes. Yet, these “walls” are highly dynamic structures that can bend, split, and fuse as cells remodel their stunning variety of shapes and internal structures. To accomplish this feat, cells use proteins that are recruited from the cytosol to reversibly shape membranes into tunnels, bubbles, furrows, fingers, and feet. In cooperation with the cytoskeleton and with metabolic changes within the phospholipid bilayer, these membrane-shaping proteins fashion the reaction surfaces and compartments that enable organelle biogenesis, intracellular membrane trafficking, cell division, and cell migration. Moreover, mechanisms that control membrane morphology underlie cell-cell interactions and thus control development, infection, formation of syncytia, and immune responses. In this Essay, we discuss the membrane-shaping proteins of the BAR domain superfamily and how they mold membranes in cellular processes and organelles. Prior to the discovery of their membrane-remodeling properties, BAR domains were identified as conserved modules shared by the yeast proteins Rvs161 and Rvs167 (reduced viability upon starvation) and the metazoan amphiphysin/BIN (bridging interactor) proteins (Takei et al., 1999Takei K.

Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Fifteen eukaryotic crystal structures from the superfamily have now been solved. Due to primary sequence divergence, the BAR domain crystal of human arfaptin-2 (Tarricone et al., 2001Tarricone C. Xiao B. Justin N. Walker P.A. Rittinger K. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) was recognized as the founding BAR structure only after a second BAR crystal structure (of Drosophila amphiphysin) revealed homology between these domains (Peter et al., 2004Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G. Vallis Y. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Science. 2004; 303: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). Together, the crystal structures demonstrate that the BAR domain superfamily is composed of subsets of unique families, including the “classical” BARs, the F-BARs (Fes/CIP4 homology-BAR), and the I-BARs (Inverse-BAR) (Frost et al., 2007Frost A. De Camilli P. Unger V.M. Structure. 2007; 15: 751-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Table 1). Each of these families share the defining elements of a BAR domain: coiled-coils that dimerize into modules with a positively charged surface (Peter et al., 2004Peter B.J. Kent H.M. Mills I.G.

By fitting atomic models of F-BAR dimers (Shimada et al., 2007Shimada A. Niwa H. Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Nitta K. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Akasaka R. Nishino Y. Toyama M. Chen L. et al.Cell. 2007; 129: 761-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) into cryo-EM reconstructions of membrane tubules, this study showed how clusters of cationic residues on the concave surface of the F-BAR module engage the membrane bilayer and enable rigid F-BAR dimers to impose their crescent shapes on the underlying membrane (Figure 1). Moreover, by visualizing F-BAR modules in a membrane-bound context, this work demonstrated that membrane tubule formation depends on the self-assembly of F-BAR modules into a helical coat (Figure 1). It will be crucial to determine how these observations reflect the general properties of the superfamily and to establish their relevance to in vivo events. BAR domains may induce membrane curvature de novo (e.g., “induced fit”), stabilize curvature generated by other forces, or detect curvature in order to recruit cytosolic factors to membranes of a particular shape or size. Inducing and sensing curvature are not exclusive of one another: local deformations caused by BAR domain proteins will facilitate binding of additional BARs and thereby generate a positive-feedback cycle for curvature propagation. Computational studies reinforce the notion that BAR domains can induce both local membrane bending and anisotropic membrane remodeling over large distances (Ayton et al., 2007Ayton G.S. Blood P.D. Voth G.A. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 3595-3602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Distinctive features of individual BAR domain-containing proteins reveal unique adaptations, suggesting that BAR domains can be used in a variety of contexts for different functions (Frost et al., 2007Frost A. De Camilli P. Unger V.M. Structure. 2007; 15: 751-752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar; Table 1). For example, the presence of flanking phosphoinositide binding motifs (Lee et al., 2002Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) or phox (PX) or pleckstrin homology (PH) domains can help to direct BAR proteins to membranes enriched in cognate phosphoinositides. Alternatively, in endophilin and amphiphysin, BAR domains are conjoined with N-terminal sequences of ∼26 residues that appear to fold into amphipathic α helices (so-called N-BAR domains) in the local environment of the bilayer polar-apolar interface. The intercalation of this helix into one leaflet of the bilayer may act like a “wedge” that causes local buckling when the polar headgroups of one lipid monolayer are pushed apart, or like an “anchor” that reduces the koff for membrane binding (Farsad et al., 2001Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, Gallop et al., 2006Gallop J.L. Jao C.C. Kent H.M. Butler P.J. Evans P.R. Langen R. McMahon H.T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2898-2910Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Though the sequence of events has not yet been determined, helix insertion may facilitate subsequent binding of the BAR module to enhance or further stabilize curvature. Unexpectedly, in some BAR domains a convex surface (rather than a concave surface) is the bilayer-binding interface. These “Inverse” or I-BAR domains promote inverse tubulation or the generation of filopodia-like extensions (Mattila et al., 2007Mattila P.K. Pykalainen A. Saarikangas J. Paavilainen V.O. Vihinen H. Jokitalo E. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Several members of the BAR domain superfamily provide a link between the membrane and the membrane-associated cytoskeleton. The nucleation of actin filaments at the plasma membrane generates mechanical forces that drive migrating cells, cell division, protrusions or invaginations of the membrane, the internalization of vesicles during endocytosis, and the “rocketing” of intracellular vesicles. F-actin polymerization is triggered by Rho-family GTPases and by the lipids PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, in coordination with nucleating factors such as the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and the Wiskott-Aldrich verprolin (WAVE) protein (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007Takenawa T. Suetsugu S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Many BAR domain proteins are linked to actin nucleation by multiple mechanisms and may coordinate this process with membrane remodeling events. For example, some BAR proteins bind to and help to activate WASP/WAVE proteins. Furthermore, as these BAR proteins form dimers, they functionally dimerize the verprolin-cofilin-acidic (VCA) domains at the C termini of WASP/WAVE proteins. Dimerization of WASP/WAVE VCA domains appears to be a potent means of activating the Arp2/3 complex, which is involved in actin nucleation (Padrick et al., 2008Padrick S.B. Cheng H.C. Ismail A.M. Panchal S.C. Doolittle L.K. Kim S. Skehan B.M. Umetani J. Brautigam C.A. Leong J.M. Rosen M.K. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 426-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, some BAR proteins act as effectors or regulators of Rho-family GTPases: they recruit the phosphoinositide phosphatase Synaptojanin, which regulates PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, and dynamin, whose role in membrane fission is interconnected with actin dynamics (Itoh and De Camilli, 2006Itoh T. De Camilli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 897-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007Takenawa T. Suetsugu S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Other BAR proteins bind to and “bundle” actin fibers directly (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007Takenawa T. Suetsugu S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). A striking case of this multifunctionality is the protein Tuba (also called dynamin-binding protein), which has four N-terminal SH3 domains, a DH domain, a BAR domain, and two C-terminal SH3 domains. The four N-terminal SH3 domains have strong avidity for dynamin, the DH domain is a Cdc42 GEF, and the C-terminal SH3 domains bind directly to N-WASP and Ena/VASP proteins (Itoh and De Camilli, 2006Itoh T. De Camilli P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 897-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The physical and functional relation to small GTPases, which together with phosphoinositides recruit cytosolic proteins to membrane compartments, seems to be important for the functions of BAR domain proteins. These GTPases coordinate interactions between BAR proteins, their target membranes, a variety of effector proteins, and actin filaments (Habermann, 2004Habermann B. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). BAR domain proteins known to interact with small GTPases include arfaptin (an effector of Arf and a ligand for Rac) (Tarricone et al., 2001Tarricone C. Xiao B. Justin N. Walker P.A. Rittinger K. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar); IRSp53 (a Rac effector implicated in filopodia formation) (Miki et al., 2000Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar); Toca-1, Toca-2/FBP17, and Toca-3/CIP4 (SH3-dependent WASP and dynamin recruitment plus HR1-dependent Cdc42 binding) (Ho et al., 2004Ho H.Y.

Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar); APPL, a Rab5/21 effector that participates in growth factor receptor trafficking and signaling (Miaczynska et al., 2004Miaczynska M. Christoforidis S. Giner A. Shevchenko A. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Habermann B. Wilm M. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Cell. 2004; 116: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar); and nervous wreck, a synaptic protein that cooperates with Cdc42 on Rab11-positive endosomes to facilitate WASP-mediated actin polymerization (Rodal et al., 2008Rodal A.A. Motola-Barnes R.N. Littleton J.T. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 8316-8325Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In fact, the BAR proteins IRSp53 and Arfaptin were initially characterized as binding partners for Rac GTPases (Miki et al., 2000Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Tarricone et al., 2001Tarricone C. Xiao B. Justin N. Walker P.A. Rittinger K. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Nature. 2001; 411: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). These observations hint at a fundamental regulatory network involving the interplay among BAR-mediated membrane deformation, the nucleation of actin fibers, and signaling through small GTPases. Membrane budding to produce vesicles is a process that, by definition, implies the generation of membrane curvature. The morphological description of proteins that coat the cytoplasmic surface of vesicles and the subsequent molecular characterization of these vesicular “coats” through biochemical, genetic, and structural studies have given us insights into the mechanisms by which curvature of the membrane bilayer can be generated and stabilized. Tubular necks—often observed prior to the fission of coated vesicles from the donor membrane (Goldenthal et al., 1984Goldenthal K. Pastan I. Willingham M. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 152: 558-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar)—were thought to result from physical forces pulling on coated buds in the absence of fission (Figure 1). The discovery of BAR domain proteins and the molecular characterization of dynamin and other curvature-generating factors showed how membrane-associated proteins or tubular coats can induce bud neck constriction and the formation of membrane tubules. BAR domain proteins are particularly important in endocytosis, where the generation of curvature is coupled tightly to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton associated with the plasma membrane. For example, a subset of BAR proteins, including amphiphysin, endophilin and SNX9, may participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by acting as hubs of a protein network that coordinates bud neck constriction, actin assembly, and recruitment of downstream factors needed for fission and uncoating (Takei et al., 1999Takei K. Slepnev V.I. Haucke V. De Camilli P. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, Farsad et al., 2001Farsad K. Ringstad N. Takei K. Floyd S.R. Rose K. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, Yarar et al., 2007Yarar D. Waterman-Storer C.M. Schmid S.L. Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The more shallow membrane curvature induced by F-BAR proteins (e.g., syndapin and Toca) may deform the bilayer early during curvature induction, although this remains to be tested (Shimada et al., 2007Shimada A. Niwa H. Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Nitta K. Hanawa-Suetsugu K. Akasaka R. Nishino Y. Toyama M. Chen L. et al.Cell. 2007; 129: 761-772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, the BAR proteins Rvs161/167 play roles both in endocytosis and in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Live-cell imaging demonstrates that the Rvs161/167 proteins are recruited to late-stage endocytic actin patches, and that in yeast lacking these proteins there is a retraction or “yo-yo” movement of the endocytic membranes generated at these sites after the initial internalization movement (Kaksonen et al., 2005Kaksonen M. Toret C.P. Drubin D.G. Cell. 2005; 123: 305-320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). These observations support the notion that the Rvs proteins coordinately control actin fiber rearrangements, invagination of endocytic buds, and perhaps fission (as this organism appears to lack an endocytic dynamin). Moreover, BAR proteins may help to fashion the membrane-trafficking intermediates known as CLathrin-Independent Carriers (CLICs) or GPI-Enriched Endocytic Compartments (GEECs) (Mayor and Pagano, 2007Mayor S. Pagano R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). For example, the BAR-PH and RhoGAP domain-containing protein GRAF1 participates in the clathrin-independent endocytosis of bacterial exotoxins and GPI-linked proteins (Lundmark et al., 2008Lundmark R. Doherty G.J. Howes M.T. Cortese K. Vallis Y. Parton R.G. McMahon H.T. Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: 1802-1808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Following fission from the plasma membrane, nascent vesicles are transported through a hierarchy of endosomal organelles that function as signaling and sorting stations. From endosomes, some material is rerouted back to the cell surface, whereas other material is either targeted to the trans-Golgi network or delivered to lysosomes for degradation. The endosome system comprises a population of morphologically and functionally heterogeneous organelles characterized by a growing list of unique lipid and protein components including BAR domain proteins such as APPL1/2 (Miaczynska et al., 2004Miaczynska M. Christoforidis S. Giner A. Shevchenko A. Uttenweiler-Joseph S. Habermann B. Wilm M. Parton R.G. Zerial M. Cell. 2004; 116: 445-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) and the sorting nexins (Cullen, 2008Cullen P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These proteins may assist in signaling and sorting processes by generating membrane microdomains or by segregating cargo into tubular extensions of these organelles. Some of the sorting nexins are components of the retromer, a protein complex that acts as a sorting coat on endosomes to mediate transport of trans-membrane cargo back to the trans-Golgi network via tubular transport intermediates (Bonifacino and Hurley, 2008Bonifacino J.S. Hurley J.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 427-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The formation of these tubular membranes is most likely attributable, at least in part, to the properties of the PX-BAR proteins SNX1, SNX2, SNX5, and SNX6. The PX-BAR module most likely drives tubule formation and may recruit the cargo recognition complex—composed of Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35—to coordinate cargo sorting with membrane tubule formation. T-tubules are narrow tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane that propagate electrical signals to the core of skeletal muscle cells and participate in excitation-contraction coupling. The presence of these tubules suggests an abundance of plasma membrane tubulating factors. Indeed, a splice variant of the BAR protein amphiphysin-2 is highly expressed in skeletal muscle and is localized on T-tubules (Lee et al., 2002Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Interestingly, as T-tubules are not endocytic structures, this splice variant lacks binding sites for clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP-2 and comprises instead a polybasic sequence (encoded by exon 10) that enhances its affinity for the plasma membrane (Lee et al., 2002Lee E. Marcucci M. Daniell L. Pypaert M. Weisz O.A. Ochoa G.C. Farsad K. Wenk M.R. De Camilli P. Science. 2002; 297: 1193-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). This protein, likely in cooperation with other proteins, plays a critical role in the induction and stabilization of this unique organelle. Genetic disruption of the only amphiphysin gene in Drosophila disrupts the T-tubule network (Razzaq et al., 2001Razzaq A. Robinson I.M. McMahon H.T. Skepper J.N. Su Y. Zelhof A.C. Jackson A.P. Gay N.J. O'Kane C.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2967-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and missense mutations in the human gene encoding amphiphysin-2 cause myopathies (Nicot et al., 2007Nicot A.S. Toussaint A. Tosch V. Kretz C. Wallgren-Pettersson C. Iwarsson E. Kingston H. Garnier J.M. Biancalana V. Oldfors A. et al.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 1134-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Podosomes are adhesion structures at contact sites between motile cells and their substrates. In contrast to focal adhesions, podosomes are highly dynamic structures that allow cells to translocate rapidly over surfaces and within tissues. They are also sites of extracellular matrix degradation and have been implicated in the migration of metastatic cancer cells (Ochoa et al., 2000Ochoa G.C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Kim W. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Podosomes are characterized by columnar arrays of actin arranged perpendicular to the attachment plane of the cell, which often contain a narrow tubular invagination of the plasma membrane throughout their length (Figure 1; Ochoa et al., 2000Ochoa G.C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Kim W. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Dynamin-2 and several proteins of the BAR superfamily are concentrated at these sites (Ochoa et al., 2000Ochoa G.C. Slepnev V.I. Neff L. Ringstad N. Takei K. Daniell L. Kim W. Cao H. McNiven M. Baron R. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar; P.D.C., unpublished data). Recently, amphiphysin-1 and dynamin-2 have been implicated in the formation of tubular structures reminiscent of podosomes at the junction between Sertoli cells and spermatids in mouse testis (Kusumi et al., 2007Kusumi N. Watanabe M. Yamada H. Li S.-A. Kashiwakura Y. Matsukawa T. Nagai A. Nasu Y. Kumon H. Takei K. Cell Struct. Funct. 2007; 32: 101-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The functions of podosome plasma membrane invaginations, including a potential endocytic function, remain to be determined. One intriguing example of the interplay between BAR-mediated membrane deformation and the actin-based cytoskeleton is found in the formation of some types of filopodia induced by proteins with I-BAR domains (Mattila et al., 2007Mattila P.K. Pykalainen A. Saarikangas J. Paavilainen V.O. Vihinen H. Jokitalo E. Lappalainen P. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). I-BARs are found at the N termini of proteins like IRSp53 and MIM (missing-in-metastasis). The term “inverse” refers to the property of these domains to induce a curvature opposite to that produced by classical BAR domains—that is, protrusions of the plasma membrane rather than invaginations—through their convex and cationic surface (Saarikangas et al., 2009Saarikangas J.

Moreover, I-BAR proteins bind to Rac GTPases and to WAVE2 through SH3 domains and also bind to actin directly through WASP-homology 2 (WH2) domains (Takenawa and Suetsugu, 2007Takenawa T. Suetsugu S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 37-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Future efforts to visualize how I-BAR filopodia connect to actin filaments will advance our understanding of the mechanical properties and signaling outputs of these unique structures. Endophilin-B1/Bif-1 plays a role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology. Depletion of endophilin-B1 by RNA interference using short-hairpin RNAs leads to the dissociation of the outer mitochondrial membrane and to the formation of vesicular and tubular structures from the remnants of this membrane (Karbowski et al., 2004Karbowski M. Jeong S.-Y. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). These results phenocopy knockdown of the dynamin homolog Drp1 (dynamin-related protein 1), a protein implicated in mitochondrial fission. Thus, Drp1 and endophilin-B1 may act in concert, and perhaps may interact directly, in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology (Karbowski et al., 2004Karbowski M. Jeong S.-Y. Youle R.J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 1027-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Such a partnership would be reminiscent of the SH3 domain-dynamin interactions that characterize the BAR proteins involved in endocytosis. Endophilin-B1 also may interact with Bax to promote apoptosis following cytokine withdrawal (Takahashi et al., 2005Takahashi Y. Karbowski M. Yamaguchi H. Kazi A. Wu J. Sebti S.M. Youle R.J. Wang H.-G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9369-9382Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The connection between endophilin-B1 and apoptosis is particularly intriguing as this protein also appears to play a role in autophagy (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi Y. Coppola D. Matsushita N. Cualing H.D. Sun M. Sato Y. Liang C. Jung J.U. Cheng J.Q. Mul J.J. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Cellular self-digestion through autophagy is recognized increasingly as fundamental to development, life-span extension, and cell death. Its dysfunction is thought to be implicated in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, and neoplastic diseases. The process of autophagy involves the sequestration of cytosol and organelles into double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) that undergo a series of shape changes and subsequently fuse with lysosomes for cargo degradation. Though its mechanism of action remains elusive, endophilin-B1/Bif-1 was shown recently to be required for the formation of autophagosomes (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi Y. Coppola D. Matsushita N. Cualing H.D. Sun M. Sato Y. Liang C. Jung J.U. Cheng J.Q. Mul J.J. et al.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1142-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Regarding the potential dual link of endophilin-B1/Bif-1 to mitochondrial dynamics and to autophagy, mitochondrial Drp1-dependent fission may work together with autophagy to eliminate damaged mitochondrial proteins. Defects in this process may play a role in the neurodegeneration underlying Parkinson's disease (McBride, 2008McBride H.M. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 183: 757-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The coordination between membrane deformation and the cytoskeleton is nowhere as dramatic as in the formation of the contractile actomyosin ring and the invagination of the plasma membrane during cell division. In fission yeast, a key participant in this elaborate process is the essential protein Cdc15. This protein is a founding member of the FCH (Fes-Cip4 homology) motif-containing family, and this sequence is now recognized as part of the F-BAR domain. Cdc15 was described originally as an SH3 domain-containing protein that regulates actin nucleation through recruitment of formins and type I myosins (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2008Roberts-Galbraith, R.H., and Gould, K.L. (2008). F-BAR Domain Proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In The Pombe Cdc15 Homology Proteins (Austin, TX: Landes Biosciences). http://www.landesbioscience.com/curie/chapter/3918/.Google Scholar). Cdc15 appears to act upstream of actomyosin ring polymerization prior to cell division and localizes with precursors of the contractile ring and fully formed contractile rings throughout cytokinesis (Wu et al., 2006Wu J.-Q. Sirotkin V. Kovar D.R. Lord M. Beltzner C.C. Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar; Figure 2). Based on the expectation that F-BAR proteins bind to the plasma membrane, Cdc15 may couple the actomyosin ring directly to the membrane while inducing or stabilizing the high degree of curvature observed at the cleavage furrow in fission yeast (Figure 2). Perhaps BAR proteins regulate the contractile apparatus during constriction by “sensing” the degree of curvature in the cleavage furrow. Alternatively, Cdc15-like proteins may initiate contractile ring formation by bending the membrane inward; other curvature-sensing proteins may detect or stabilize the still higher degree of curvature found at the point of maximum constriction in order to trigger disassembly of the contractile ring. Cdc15 and other BAR proteins are also found at actin patches—known sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast—though Cdc15 only concentrates in actin patches at the cell tips during interphase (Wu et al., 2006Wu J.-Q. Sirotkin V. Kovar D.R. Lord M. Beltzner C.C. Kuhn J.R. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 391-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar; reviewed in Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2008Roberts-Galbraith, R.H., and Gould, K.L. (2008). F-BAR Domain Proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In The Pombe Cdc15 Homology Proteins (Austin, TX: Landes Biosciences). http://www.landesbioscience.com/curie/chapter/3918/.Google Scholar). During mitosis, Cdc15 is dephosphorylated and moves exclusively from cell tips to the precursors of the contractile ring, before becoming an integral component of the fully formed ring (Figure 2). During constriction of the ring and ingression of the cleavage furrow, re-phosphorylated Cdc15 starts moving to newly formed actin patches adjacent to the cleavage furrow (that is, at the tips of the future daughter cells). Thus, a key question that needs to be addressed is whether the localization of BAR and F-BAR proteins at sites of cell division also reflects the need for ongoing endocytosis within or near the cleavage furrow. In budding yeast and mammalian cells, the degree of membrane curvature found at the division site is dramatically different from the high degree of curvature seen in fission yeast (Figure 2). Yet there is evidence that even in these cells, BAR proteins play key roles during cytokinesis. The budding yeast homolog of Cdc15 (Hof1/Cyk2) is a known cytokinesis factor that forms a ring around the bud neck (Lippincott and Li, 1998Lippincott J. Li R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 1947-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In addition, a recent study of the S. cerevisiae interactome suggests that Syp1—predicted to have a Cdc15-like F-BAR domain (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2008Roberts-Galbraith, R.H., and Gould, K.L. (2008). F-BAR Domain Proteins in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In The Pombe Cdc15 Homology Proteins (Austin, TX: Landes Biosciences). http://www.landesbioscience.com/curie/chapter/3918/.Google Scholar)—is the hub of a network connecting WASP (Las17), the bud-neck septins (SHS1 and Cdc11), a myosin (Myo5), and the cytokinesis protein Mid2 (an anillin ortholog) as well as components of actin patches (Tarassov et al., 2008Tarassov K. Messier V. Landry C. Radinovic S. Molina M. Shames I. Malitskaya Y. Vogel J. Bussey H. Michnick S. Science. 2008; 320: 1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Finally, the human protein PSTPIP1 possesses F-BAR and SH3 domains that are highly homologous with those of Cdc15 and localizes to the cleavage furrow of cultured human cells (Spencer et al., 1997Spencer S. Dowbenko D. Cheng J. Li W. Brush J. Utzig S. Simanis V. Lasky L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 845-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Together, these observations hint at the existence of an ancient but poorly understood circuit linking BAR domain superfamily proteins with cytokinesis in general and with the assembly, constriction, and disassembly of the contractile ring in particular. The membrane-molding proteins of the BAR domain superfamily create a multiplicity of membranous structures whose forms underlie the function of many cellular processes. As fundamental determinants of membrane and cytoskeleton remodeling, proteins of the BAR domain superfamily will continue to be rich objects of inquiry. Their study has revealed new principles of membrane remodeling and contributed to establishing the concept of membrane curvature-mediated signaling. Challenging next steps will be to visualize and quantify their associations with membranes and cytoskeletal structures in living cells. Moreover, we have much to learn about their polymerization properties and the mechanisms by which cells regulate their nucleation and disassembly. It is hoped that further inquiry will yield novel insights into the growing number of diseases that result from BAR protein dysfunction and may point to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1991425207,"The microRNA miR-7 is perfectly conserved from annelids to humans, and yet some of the genes that it regulates in Drosophila are not regulated in mammals. We have explored the role of lineage restricted targets, using Drosophila, in order to better understand the evolutionary significance of microRNA-target relationships. From studies of two well characterized developmental regulatory networks, we find that miR-7 functions in several interlocking feedback and feedforward loops, and propose that its role in these networks is to buffer them against perturbation. To directly demonstrate this function for miR-7, we subjected the networks to temperature fluctuation and found that miR-7 is essential for the maintenance of regulatory stability under conditions of environmental flux. We suggest that some conserved microRNAs like miR-7 may enter into novel genetic relationships to buffer developmental programs against variation and impart robustness to diverse regulatory networks."
https://openalex.org/W2091232875,"Epigenetic information undergoes extensive reprogramming in the germline between generations. This reprogramming may be essential to establish a developmental ground state in the zygote. We show that mutants in spr-5, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the H3K4me2 demethylase LSD1/KDM1, exhibit progressive sterility over many generations. This sterility correlates with the misregulation of spermatogenesis-expressed genes and transgenerational accumulation of the histone modification dimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 (H3K4me2). This suggests that H3K4me2 can serve as a stable epigenetic memory, and that erasure of H3K4me2 by LSD/KDM1 in the germline prevents the inappropriate transmission of this epigenetic memory from one generation to the next. Thus, our results provide direct mechanistic insights into the processes that are required for epigenetic reprogramming between generations."
https://openalex.org/W1996468220,"<h2>Summary</h2> Planar cell polarity (PCP) is critical for morphogenesis in metazoans. PCP in vertebrates regulates stereocilia alignment in neurosensory cells of the cochlea and closure of the neural tube through convergence and extension movements (CE). Noncanonical Wnt morphogens regulate PCP and CE in vertebrates, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Smurfs are ubiquitin ligases that regulate signaling, cell polarity and motility through spatiotemporally restricted ubiquitination of diverse substrates. Here, we report an unexpected role for Smurfs in controlling PCP and CE. Mice mutant for <i>Smurf1</i> and <i>Smurf2</i> display PCP defects in the cochlea and CE defects that include a failure to close the neural tube. Further, we show that Smurfs engage in a noncanonical Wnt signaling pathway that targets the core PCP protein Prickle1 for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Our work thus uncovers ubiquitin ligases in a mechanistic link between noncanonical Wnt signaling and PCP/CE."
https://openalex.org/W1969575940,"Cotranscriptional histone methylations by Set1 and Set2 have been shown to affect histone acetylation at promoters and 3' regions of genes, respectively. While histone H3K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) is thought to promote nucleosome acetylation and remodeling near promoters, we show here that H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) by Set1 leads to reduced histone acetylation levels near 5' ends of genes. H3K4me2 recruits the Set3 complex via the Set3 PHD finger, localizing the Hos2 and Hst1 subunits to deacetylate histones in 5' transcribed regions. Cells lacking the Set1-Set3 complex pathway are sensitive to mycophenolic acid and have reduced polymerase levels at a Set3 target gene, suggesting a positive role in transcription. We propose that Set1 establishes two distinct chromatin zones on genes: H3K4me3 leads to high levels of acetylation and low nucleosome density at promoters, while H3K4me2 just downstream recruits the Set3 complex to suppress nucleosome acetylation and remodeling."

It has evolved various strategies to counteract the production and action of type I interferons, which mobilize the front-line defense against viral infection. In this study we demonstrate that SARS coronavirus M protein inhibits gene transcription of type I interferons. M protein potently antagonizes the activation of interferon-stimulated response element-dependent transcription by double-stranded RNA, RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, IKKϵ, and virus-induced signaling adaptor (VISA) but has no influence on the transcriptional activity of this element when IRF3 or IRF7 is overexpressed. M protein physically associates with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKϵ, and TRAF3 and likely sequesters some of them in membrane-associated cytoplasmic compartments. Consequently, the expression of M protein prevents the formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex and thereby inhibits TBK1/IKKϵ-dependent activation of IRF3/IRF7 transcription factors.

Sendai virus was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. HEK293/ACE2 cells infected with 5 multiplicity of infection of SARS coronavirus or Sendai virus were harvested to 1× SDS gel loading buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02% bromphenol blue) for protein analysis or to cell lysis buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 8.0, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for RNA analysis.

Briefly, TBK1/IKKϵ-containing protein complex was immunoprecipitated from transfected HEK293 cells. The precipitates were suspended in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and recombinant IκBα (Santa Cruz) or IRF3 (Abnova). Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. SARS coronavirus N protein has been shown to antagonize the production of type I interferons (7Kopecky-Bromberg S.A. Martínez-Sobrido L. Frieman M. Baric R.A. Palese P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In our study of the gene regulatory function of N protein (32Siu K.L. Chan C.P. Chan C. Zheng B.J. Jin D.Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), we included M protein as a control and found serendipitously that M protein was a more potent inhibitor of interferon β promoter when compared with N protein (Fig. 1). Considered together with the ability of M protein to interact with host factors and to modulate expression of cellular genes (25Hatakeyama S. Matsuoka Y. Ueshiba H. Komatsu N. Itoh K. Shichijo S.

Virol. 2007; 79: 1431-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we set out to characterize M protein-mediated inhibition of type I interferon production in detail. As a first step, we expressed M protein transiently in HEK293 and HeLa cells. The M protein-expressing cells did not show any growth defect, and no signs of apoptosis were observed (Fig. 1A). M protein was abundantly found in transfected cells (Fig. 1B). Consistent with a predominant Golgi localization shown in previous reports (21Nal B. Chan C. Kien F. Siu L. Tse J. Chu K. Kam J. Staropoli I. Crescenzo-Chaigne B. Escriou N. van der Werf S. Yuen K.Y. Altmeyer R. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 1423-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 23Ma H.C. Fang C.P. Hsieh Y.C. Chen S.C. Li H.C. Lo S.Y. J. Biomed. Sci. 2008; 15: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), M protein was found to co-localize substantially with GM130 (Fig. 1A), a marker of the Golgi apparatus (45Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Expression of M protein did not suppress transcription driven by the long terminal repeats of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1, which was stimulated by viral transactivator Tax (Fig. 1C). Hence, M protein is unlikely a general inhibitor of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription. Next, we assessed the influence of M protein expression on the induction of interferon β gene transcription using pIFNβ-Luc, a luciferase reporter construct driven by interferon β promoter (33Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Natsukawa T. Shinobu N. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Akira S. Fujita T. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 730-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Notably, expression of M protein led to significant and dose-dependent suppression of dsRNA-induced activation of interferon β promoter (Fig. 1D). This suppression by M protein was more pronounced than the effect of two previously reported viral antagonists of interferon production, SARS coronavirus N protein and influenza A virus NS1 protein (7Kopecky-Bromberg S.A. Martínez-Sobrido L. Frieman M. Baric R.A. Palese P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 39Kok K.H. Jin D.Y. J. Gen. Virol. 2006; 87: 2639-2644Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In contrast, E or ORF7a protein of SARS coronavirus did not modulate the activation of interferon β promoter by dsRNA (Fig. 1D). When we repeated the luciferase assay with a reporter construct driven by canonical ISRE enhancer elements, which were bound to IRF3 and IRF7 (36Zhang L. Pagano J.S. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1061-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 46Schafer S.L. Lin R. Moore P.A. Hiscott J. Pitha P.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), the same pattern of inhibitory activity mediated by M, N, and influenza A virus NS1 proteins was observed (Fig. 1E). These results suggested that SARS coronavirus M protein is a potent inhibitor of the activity of IRF-responsive elements in the interferon β promoter. We next addressed at which step of the signaling pathway M protein might inhibit dsRNA-induced production of type I interferons. Various transducer proteins that are previously known to stimulate interferon production (13Borden E.C. Sen G.C. Uze G. Silverman R.H. Ransohoff R.M. Foster G.R. Stark G.R. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 975-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar, 14O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2018) Google Scholar, 15Hiscott J. J.

Virol. 2008; 89: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar) were used to activate ISRE-dependent expression of luciferase reporter (Fig. 2). These include cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors RIG-I (Fig. 2A) and MDA5 (Fig. 2B), adaptor protein VISA/IPS1/MAVS/Cardif (Fig. 2E), and protein kinases TBK1 (Fig. 2C) and IKKϵ (Fig. 2D) as well as ISRE binding transcription factors IRF3 (Fig. 2F) and IRF7 (Fig. 2G). All of these transducer proteins tested strongly activated the enhancer activity of ISRE (Fig. 2). Interestingly, expression of M protein suppressed ISRE-driven transcriptional activity induced by RIG-I, MDA5, VISA, TBK1, and IKKϵ but not by IRF3 or IRF7 (Fig. 2). In these assays, SARS coronavirus N, E, or ORF7a protein was unable to counteract any ISRE activator. Thus, although both N and M proteins inhibited interferon production (7Kopecky-Bromberg S.A. Martínez-Sobrido L. Frieman M. Baric R.A. Palese P. J. Virol. 2007; 81: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), they plausibly acted through different mechanisms. Consistent with previous findings (48Pichlmair A. Schulz O. Tan C.P. Näslund T.I. Liljeström P. Weber F. Reis e Sousa C. Science. 2006; 314: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar, 49Mibayashi M. Martínez-Sobrido L. Loo Y.M. Cárdenas W.B. Gale Jr., M. García-Sastre A. J.

Microbiol. 2007; 9: 930-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), influenza A virus NS1 protein inhibited the stimulatory activity of RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, and IKKϵ (Fig. 2, A ∼ D). However, unlike SARS coronavirus M protein, NS1 had no influence on the activity of VISA (Fig. 2E). These results suggested that M protein suppressed interferon production in a manner distinct from that of NS1. M protein inhibited TBK1/IKKϵ-dependent activation of interferon production but was unable to counteract the action of transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7 (Fig. 2). This pattern of inhibitory activity suggested that M protein might function at a step before nuclear activation of IRF3 and IRF7. In light of this, we next investigated whether M protein physically interacted with the cytoplasmic transducer proteins. We overexpressed M and individual transducer proteins RIG-I, MDA5, TBK1, IKKϵ, TANK, TRAF3, and TRAF6 in HEK293 cells and performed reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation to assess their interactions (Fig. 3). Although both M protein and the transducer proteins were expressed abundantly in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3A), M protein was found to co-precipitate with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKϵ, and TRAF3 but not with MDA5, TANK, or TRAF6 (Fig. 3, B and C). Notably, precipitations with two different antibodies yielded similar results (Fig. 3B compared with Fig. 3C), suggesting that M protein consistently formed a complex with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKϵ, and TRAF3. In keeping with this notion, M protein was found to co-localize substantially with IKKϵ and TRAF3 in HeLa cells to discrete cytoplasmic subdomains that were compatible with the Golgi complex (Fig. 4). Particularly, IKKϵ was sporadically found in multiple cytoplasmic dots in the absence of M protein (Fig. 4, panels 1–3). In contrast, IKKϵ was more concentrated to the M protein-containing region in cells expressing M protein (Fig. 4, panels 7–9).FIGURE 4Colocalization of SARS coronavirus M protein with IKKϵ and TRAF3. HeLa cells were transfected individually with expression plasmids for IKKϵ (panels 1–3), TRAF3 (panels 4–6), IKKϵ + M (panels 7–9), and TRAF3 + M (panels 10–12). Cells were then stained for M and IKKϵ/TRAF3 with anti-Myc and anti-FLAG, respectively. The green and red fluorescent signals were merged, and nuclear morphology (blue) was visualized with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Colocalization appeared yellow. Bar, 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The association of M protein with TBK1/IKKϵ (Fig. 3) raised two possibilities that might explain the inhibition of interferon production. First, M protein might inhibit catalytic activity of TBK1/IKKϵ to phosphorylate IRF3/IRF7. Second, M protein might interfere with the formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex required for phosphorylation of IRF3/IRF7 in the cytoplasm. To test these possibilities, we assessed the impact of M protein on the kinase activity of TBK1/IKKϵ both in vitro and in vivo. We expressed M protein and TBK1/IKKϵ in HEK293 cells (Fig. 5A) and immunoprecipitated TBK1/IKKϵ-containing protein complex (Fig. 5B). The precipitates were then incubated with recombinant IκBα or recombinant IRF3. Phosphorylated IκBα and IRF3 were analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 5, C and D). Notably, the TBK1/IKKϵ complex purified from M protein-expressing cells contained M protein (Fig. 3C). However, the TBK1/IKKϵ complexes containing or not containing M protein showed similar activity to phosphorylate IκBα or IRF3 (Fig. 5, C and D, lane 3 compared with lane 2 and lane 6 compared with lane 5). Thus, the expression of M protein did not modulate the catalytic activity of TBK1/IKKϵ kinase. On the other hand, phosphorylated IRF3 was detected in cultured HEK293 cells expressing TBK1/IKKϵ alone but not in cells simultaneously expressing TBK1/IKKϵ and M protein, whereas comparable amounts of IRF3 were found in all different groups of cells (Fig. 6, lane 2 compared with lane 3 and lane 4 compared with lane 5). These results were consistent with the notion that M protein inhibits in vivo phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1/IKKϵ. To verify the relevance of M protein-mediated inhibitory effects to SARS coronavirus infection, we also examined phosphorylation of IRF3 and production of interferon β transcript in cells infected with SARS coronavirus. Both phosphorylated IRF3 and elevated expression of interferon β mRNA were detected in cells infected with Sendai virus (Fig. 7, A and C). In contrast, although IRF3 was abundantly found in cells infected with SARS coronavirus, neither phosphorylation of IRF3 nor induced expression of interferon β transcript was observed. These results were consistent with previous findings (4Thiel V. Weber F. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2008; 19: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 5Frieman M. Baric R. Microbiol. Mol.

Virol. 2008; 82: 4471-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex in the cytoplasm is an essential step in the activation of IRF3/IRF7 (15Hiscott J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15325-15329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 16Yoneyama M. Fujita T. J. Biol.

M protein physically interacted with TBK1/IKKϵ and TRAF3 (Fig. 3). In addition, they also colocalized to the cytoplasmic subdomains that were likely the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4). Plausibly, M protein might impede the formation of a functional TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex by masking the interaction domains or retaining some of the subunits in the Golgi complex. Indeed, when we co-expressed TBK1, TRAF3, and M in HEK293 cells, the interaction between TBK1 and TRAF3, which was evident in cells expressing TBK1 and TRAF3, was not detected (Fig. 8A, lane 2 compared with lane 1). Likewise, the interaction between IKKϵ and TRAF3 was not observed in M protein-expressing cells (Fig. 8A, lane 4 compared with lane 3). Furthermore, the formation of TRAF3-TANK complex was also blocked in the presence of M protein (Fig. 8A, lane 6 compared with lane 5). Hence, M protein impeded the formation of a functional TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex. Importantly, the formation of this complex was also impaired in SARS coronavirus-infected cells (Fig. 8B). As such, the interaction of TRAF3 with TBK1, IKKϵ, and TANK was impeded in infected cells where N protein was expressed (Fig. 8B, lanes 2, 4, and 6 compared with lanes 1, 3, and 5, respectively). Although the roles of other viral proteins could not be excluded, the same pattern for the impeded formation of TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex in cells expressing M protein alone and cells infected with SARS coronavirus supported the notion that M protein contributes significantly to the inhibition of type I interferon production during viral infection. We demonstrated in this study that SARS coronavirus M protein inhibited the production of type I interferons through a new mechanism. M protein predominantly localized to the Golgi complex and potently suppressed dsRNA-induced expression of type I interferon genes (Fig. 1). M protein exerted its inhibitory effect on cytoplasmic dsRNA sensors RIG1 and MDA5 as well as other transducer proteins VISA, TBK1, and IKKϵ, but it could not counteract the activation mediated directly by IRF3 and IRF7 (Fig. 2). M protein interacted with RIG-I, TBK1, IKKϵ, and TRAF3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3) and likely sequestered some of them in discrete compartments that were consistent with the membrane-associated Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4). Although M protein did not directly inhibit the catalytic activity of TBK1/IKKϵ kinase (Fig. 5), it impeded the formation of a functional TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex (Fig. 8), thereby inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF3 (FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7). Importantly, formation of the TRAF3·TANK·TBK1/IKKϵ complex, phosphorylation of IRF3, and production of interferon β were also inhibited in SARS coronavirus-infected cells (FIGURE 7, FIGURE 8). Our findings suggested a new role for M protein in pathogenesis of SARS coronavirus. This is not surprising a since M protein was previously shown to modulate cellular signaling and apoptosis (28Chan C.M. Ma C.W. Chan W.Y. Chan H.Y.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2007; 459: 197-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 29Fang X. Gao J. Zheng H. Li B. Kong L. Zhang Y. Wang W. Zeng Y. Ye L. J. Med.

Interestingly, an adaptive mutant of M protein was found to enhance viral replication and/or infectivity (27Pacciarini F. Ghezzi S. Canducci F. Sims A. Sampaolo M. Ferioli E. Clementi M. Poli G. Conaldi P.G. Baric R. Vicenzi E. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5137-5144Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because a reduction in interferon-inducing activity was shown to be associated with M protein mutations in transmissible gastroenteritis virus (26Laude H. Gelfi J. Lavenant L. Charley B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 743-749Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), M protein of SARS coronavirus might also influence viral replication through inhibition of interferon production. Thus, it will be of great interest to understand whether the particular mutation in SARS coronavirus M protein might influence its ability to inhibit the induction of type I interferons. A better understanding of the role of M protein in pathogenesis of SARS has important implications in the development of new antivirals and vaccines. Other SARS coronaviral proteins including ORF3b, ORF6, N, nsp1, and papain-like protease were also known to inhibit interferon production and/or signaling (6Kamitani W. Narayanan K. Huang C.

Particularly, our detailed comparison of M and N proteins in their inhibition of various activators (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2) suggested that they targeted different steps. Although the requirement of M protein for virion assembly prevents us from studying interferon production with M protein deletion mutants of SARS coronavirus, the coordinated actions of different interferon-antagonizing viral proteins in infected cells merit further investigations. This also poses major technical challenges for future attempts to verify and distinguish the contributions from different viral proteins during infection. Identification of M protein mutants lacking the interferon-antagonizing activity alone might prove useful in future studies. Viral countermeasures for interferon production and signaling have been well described (17Randall R.E. Goodbourn S. J. Gen. Virol. 2008; 89: 1-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2062899296,"Defective membrane repair can contribute to the progression of muscular dystrophy. Although mutations in caveolin-3 (Cav3) and dysferlin are linked to muscular dystrophy in human patients, the molecular mechanism underlying the functional interplay between Cav3 and dysferlin in membrane repair of muscle physiology and disease has not been fully resolved. We recently discovered that mitsugumin 53 (MG53), a muscle-specific TRIM (Tri-partite motif) family protein (TRIM72), contributes to intracellular vesicle trafficking and is an essential component of the membrane repair machinery in striated muscle. Here we show that MG53 interacts with dysferlin and Cav3 to regulate membrane repair in skeletal muscle. MG53 mediates active trafficking of intracellular vesicles to the sarcolemma and is required for movement of dysferlin to sites of cell injury during repair patch formation. Mutations in Cav3 (P104L, R26Q) that cause retention of Cav3 in Golgi apparatus result in aberrant localization of MG53 and dysferlin in a dominant-negative fashion, leading to defective membrane repair. Our data reveal that a molecular complex formed by MG53, dysferlin, and Cav3 is essential for repair of muscle membrane damage and also provide a therapeutic target for treatment of muscular and cardiovascular diseases that are linked to compromised membrane repair."
https://openalex.org/W1988408302,"Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) play important roles in normal and pathological remodeling processes including atherothrombotic disease, inflammation, angiogenesis, and cancer. MMPs have been viewed as matrix-degrading enzymes, but recent studies have shown that they possess direct signaling capabilities. Platelets harbor several MMPs that modulate hemostatic function and platelet survival; however their mode of action remains unknown. We show that platelet MMP-1 activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1) on the surface of platelets. Exposure of platelets to fibrillar collagen converts the surface-bound proMMP-1 zymogen to active MMP-1, which promotes aggregation through PAR1. Unexpectedly, MMP-1 cleaves PAR1 at a distinct site that strongly activates Rho-GTP pathways, cell shape change and motility, and MAPK signaling. Blockade of MMP1-PAR1 curtails thrombogenesis under arterial flow conditions and inhibits thrombosis in animals. These studies provide a link between matrix-dependent activation of metalloproteases and platelet-G protein signaling and identify MMP1-PAR1 as a potential target for the prevention of arterial thrombosis."

The CTD plays a critical role in the specific recognition of dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA, while the DEAD box helicase cooperatively enhances the affinity to dsRNA through a conformational change. In the resting state, RIG-I is believed to be in closed conformation via interaction with these three domains (13Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Upon viral infection, CTD specifically recognizes viral RNA and induces a domain rearrangement that allows RIG-I to form a stable complex with viral RNA and simultaneously exposes the tandem CARDs so that RIG-I is assumed to become an open conformation to interact with IPS-1/MAVS/VISA/Cardif (8Takahasi K.

Immunity. 2008; 29: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).In the previous report, we have solved the solution structure of RIG-I CTD and shown the presence of a large positively charged surface that is responsible for viral RNA binding. In this report, we compare RNA-binding activity of the three CTDs (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) and determine the solution structures of MDA5 and LGP2 CTDs. The RNA-binding activity is correlated to a conserved RNA binding loop, including a critical phenylalanine residue of RIG-I and LGP2. This residue is not conserved in MDA5, reflecting the distinct specificity of this sensor. Our results provide new insights into the recognition of viral RNA in cytoplasm.DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported here compared the RNA-binding activity of CTDs of RLRs. The results of SPR and EMSA assays suggested that LGP2 CTD bound to dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA with higher affinity than RIG-I, but that MDA5 CTD exhibited weaker binding.The solution structure of the CTD revealed several critical features shared among or unique to each RLR. There is an RNA binding loop in all the CTDs, and the NMR structure and titration studies as well as the functional studies showed that the RNA binding loop in RIG-I and LGP2 are critical for RNA recognition but that it seems to be less important in MDA5. In silico docking with RIG-I (Fig. 4C) suggests that dsRNA lies on the basic groove of the RIG-I CTD, and that multiple interactions between the basic residues and phosphate backbone of the RNA maintains the complex. In the structure of the dsRNA-bound model of RIG-I CTD, the aromatic moiety of Phe-853 is stacked into the groove of the dsRNA via the hydrophobic interaction with a ribose moiety of the dsRNA. This interaction would anchor the position of both dsRNA and the RNA binding loop and allow the side chain of the conserved Lys-851 to form a stable electrostatic interaction with dsRNA. Whereas, in MDA5, the aromatic residue in this position is replaced by Cys, which would impair the hydrophobic interaction. Moreover, the flat surface formed by the RNA binding loop is not favorable for the binding between MDA5 and dsRNAs. On the other hand, the Phe-601 of LGP2 is located in a similar position and may similarly interact with the sugar moiety as is suggested in RIG-I (Fig. 4C). Taken together, both RIG-I CTD and LGP2 CTD bind to dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA with high affinity. It is to be noted that slower migrating complexes are observed at higher protein concentrations, particularly with LGP2 (Fig. 1C). These complexes are likely multiple LGP2 molecules bound to single dsRNA molecules. Our model (Fig. 4C) allows binding of multiple CTDs with single dsRNA. Formation of RLR multimers on dsRNA or 5′ppp-ssRNA may facilitate signaling through CARD oligomerization (14Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunity. 2008; 29: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Further, despite a low binding affinity, MDA5 CTD also recognizes dsRNA, and the residues present in the basic surface are critical for the signaling activity of MDA5 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), suggesting that MDA5 CTD participates in dsRNA recognition. However it is also known that full-length MDA5 exhibits lower binding affinity compared with LGP2 and RIG-I (22Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Matsumoto K. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Foy E. Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Akira S. Yonehara S. Kato A. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), suggesting that MDA5 may utilize some other RNA recognition protein. Related to this, LGP2−/− mice exhibit hypersensitivity to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection (7Venkataraman T. Valdes M. Elsby R. Kakuta S. Caceres G. Saijo S. Iwakura Y. Barber G.N. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 6444-6455Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), detection of which is mediated by MDA5 (5Kato H. Takeuchi O. Sato S. Yoneyama M. Yamamoto M. Matsui K. Uematsu S. Jung A. Kawai T. Ishii K.J. Yamaguchi O. Otsu K. Tsujimura T. Koh C.S. Reis e Sousa C. Matsuura Y. Fujita T. Akira S. Nature. 2006; 441: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2845) Google Scholar). Further, our preliminary result suggests that LGP2 and MDA5 bind to poly(I:C) in a cooperative manner (not shown).Both RIG-I and LGP2 recognize dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA, the two distinct non-self RNA patterns. In the case of 5′ppp-ssRNA recognition, 5′-end triphosphate is an apparent determinant of a non-self RNA. Although the model here provides a recognition mechanism of dsRNA by the CTD of RIG-I and LGP2, the recognition of 5′ppp-ssRNA by RIG-I and LGP2 need to be further substantiated. Interestingly, mutagenesis studies indicate that critical residues for dsRNA recognition are also indispensable for 5′ppp-ssRNA recognition (8Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H. Narita R. Gale Jr., M. Inagaki F. Fujita T. Mol. Cell. 2008; 29: 428-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar) (FIGURE 5, FIGURE 6, FIGURE 7), suggesting common structural features of these patterns. In summary, our functional and structural analyses have uncovered the mechanism underlying the different functions of each RLR molecule. During revision of the manuscript a report describing crystal structure of LGP2 CTD and dsRNA was published (24Li X. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Brooks M.T. Bharmaiah S. Herr A.B. Kao C. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; Google Scholar). The report essentially describes recognition of dsRNA ends by LGP2. However, the EMSA result shows that the end structure of dsRNA does not affect recognition by LGP2 (supplemental Fig. 4). Apparently, further analyses are required to elucidate the mechanism of dsRNA recognition by RLR. A variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, including microbial peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, β-1,3-glucan, and viral DNA or RNA are recognized by pattern recognition receptors that evoke the innate immune responses of host cells.

The CTD plays a critical role in the specific recognition of dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA, while the DEAD box helicase cooperatively enhances the affinity to dsRNA through a conformational change. In the resting state, RIG-I is believed to be in closed conformation via interaction with these three domains (13Saito T. Hirai R. Loo Y.M. Owen D. Johnson C.L. Sinha S.C. Akira S. Fujita T. Gale Jr., M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 582-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Upon viral infection, CTD specifically recognizes viral RNA and induces a domain rearrangement that allows RIG-I to form a stable complex with viral RNA and simultaneously exposes the tandem CARDs so that RIG-I is assumed to become an open conformation to interact with IPS-1/MAVS/VISA/Cardif (8Takahasi K.

In the previous report, we have solved the solution structure of RIG-I CTD and shown the presence of a large positively charged surface that is responsible for viral RNA binding. In this report, we compare RNA-binding activity of the three CTDs (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) and determine the solution structures of MDA5 and LGP2 CTDs. The RNA-binding activity is correlated to a conserved RNA binding loop, including a critical phenylalanine residue of RIG-I and LGP2. This residue is not conserved in MDA5, reflecting the distinct specificity of this sensor. Our results provide new insights into the recognition of viral RNA in cytoplasm. DISCUSSIONThe experiments reported here compared the RNA-binding activity of CTDs of RLRs. The results of SPR and EMSA assays suggested that LGP2 CTD bound to dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA with higher affinity than RIG-I, but that MDA5 CTD exhibited weaker binding.The solution structure of the CTD revealed several critical features shared among or unique to each RLR. There is an RNA binding loop in all the CTDs, and the NMR structure and titration studies as well as the functional studies showed that the RNA binding loop in RIG-I and LGP2 are critical for RNA recognition but that it seems to be less important in MDA5. In silico docking with RIG-I (Fig. 4C) suggests that dsRNA lies on the basic groove of the RIG-I CTD, and that multiple interactions between the basic residues and phosphate backbone of the RNA maintains the complex. In the structure of the dsRNA-bound model of RIG-I CTD, the aromatic moiety of Phe-853 is stacked into the groove of the dsRNA via the hydrophobic interaction with a ribose moiety of the dsRNA. This interaction would anchor the position of both dsRNA and the RNA binding loop and allow the side chain of the conserved Lys-851 to form a stable electrostatic interaction with dsRNA. Whereas, in MDA5, the aromatic residue in this position is replaced by Cys, which would impair the hydrophobic interaction. Moreover, the flat surface formed by the RNA binding loop is not favorable for the binding between MDA5 and dsRNAs. On the other hand, the Phe-601 of LGP2 is located in a similar position and may similarly interact with the sugar moiety as is suggested in RIG-I (Fig. 4C). Taken together, both RIG-I CTD and LGP2 CTD bind to dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA with high affinity. It is to be noted that slower migrating complexes are observed at higher protein concentrations, particularly with LGP2 (Fig. 1C). These complexes are likely multiple LGP2 molecules bound to single dsRNA molecules. Our model (Fig. 4C) allows binding of multiple CTDs with single dsRNA. Formation of RLR multimers on dsRNA or 5′ppp-ssRNA may facilitate signaling through CARD oligomerization (14Yoneyama M. Fujita T. Immunity. 2008; 29: 178-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar).Further, despite a low binding affinity, MDA5 CTD also recognizes dsRNA, and the residues present in the basic surface are critical for the signaling activity of MDA5 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5), suggesting that MDA5 CTD participates in dsRNA recognition. However it is also known that full-length MDA5 exhibits lower binding affinity compared with LGP2 and RIG-I (22Yoneyama M. Kikuchi M. Matsumoto K. Imaizumi T. Miyagishi M. Taira K. Foy E. Loo Y.M. Gale Jr., M. Akira S. Yonehara S. Kato A. Fujita T. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2851-2858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar), suggesting that MDA5 may utilize some other RNA recognition protein. Related to this, LGP2−/− mice exhibit hypersensitivity to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection (7Venkataraman T. Valdes M. Elsby R. Kakuta S. Caceres G. Saijo S. Iwakura Y. Barber G.N. J.

Further, our preliminary result suggests that LGP2 and MDA5 bind to poly(I:C) in a cooperative manner (not shown).Both RIG-I and LGP2 recognize dsRNA and 5′ppp-ssRNA, the two distinct non-self RNA patterns. In the case of 5′ppp-ssRNA recognition, 5′-end triphosphate is an apparent determinant of a non-self RNA. Although the model here provides a recognition mechanism of dsRNA by the CTD of RIG-I and LGP2, the recognition of 5′ppp-ssRNA by RIG-I and LGP2 need to be further substantiated. Interestingly, mutagenesis studies indicate that critical residues for dsRNA recognition are also indispensable for 5′ppp-ssRNA recognition (8Takahasi K. Yoneyama M. Nishihori T. Hirai R. Kumeta H.

In summary, our functional and structural analyses have uncovered the mechanism underlying the different functions of each RLR molecule. During revision of the manuscript a report describing crystal structure of LGP2 CTD and dsRNA was published (24Li X. Ranjith-Kumar C.T. Brooks M.T. Bharmaiah S. Herr A.B. Kao C. Li P. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; Google Scholar). The report essentially describes recognition of dsRNA ends by LGP2. However, the EMSA result shows that the end structure of dsRNA does not affect recognition by LGP2 (supplemental Fig. 4). Apparently, further analyses are required to elucidate the mechanism of dsRNA recognition by RLR. The experiments reported here compared the RNA-binding activity of CTDs of RLRs.

This effect was recently confirmed in HCV-infected patients where Debio 025 treatment dramatically decreased HCV viral load, suggesting that Cyps inhibitors represent a novel class of anti-HCV agents. However, it remains unclear how these compounds control HCV replication. Recent studies suggest that Cyps are important for HCV replication. However, a profound disagreement currently exists as to the respective roles of Cyp members in HCV replication. In this study, we analyzed the respective contribution of Cyp members to HCV replication by specifically knocking down their expression by both transient and stable small RNA interference. Only the CypA knockdown drastically decreased HCV replication. The re-expression of an exogenous CypA escape protein, which contains escape mutations at the small RNA interference recognition site, restored HCV replication, demonstrating the specificity for the CypA requirement. We then mutated residues that reside in the hydrophobic pocket of CypA where proline-containing peptide substrates and cyclosporine A bind and that are vital for the enzymatic or the hydrophobic pocket binding activity of CypA. Remarkably, these CypA mutants fail to restore HCV replication, suggesting for the first time that HCV exploits either the isomerase or the chaperone activity of CypA to replicate in hepatocytes and that CypA is the principal mediator of the Cyp inhibitor anti-HCV activity. Moreover, we demonstrated that the HCV NS5B polymerase associates with CypA via its enzymatic pocket.

However, persistently infected individuals develop high risks for chronic liver diseases such as hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis (1Pawlotsky J.M. Hepatology. 2006; 43: S207-S220Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The combination of IFNα and ribavirin that serves as current therapy for chronically HCV-infected patients not only has a low success rate (about 50%) (2Hayashi N. Takehara T. J.

Unlike CsA, these molecules do not display calcineurin affinity and specifically inhibit the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PPIase) Cyps. Most importantly, recent clinical data demonstrated that Debio 025 dramatically decreased HCV viral load (3.6 log decrease) in patients coinfected with HCV and HIV (15Flisiak R. Horban A. Gallay P. Bobardt M. Selvarajah S. Wiercinska-Drapalo A. Siwak E. Cielniak I. Higersberger J. Kierkus J. Aeschlimann C. Grosgurin P. Nicolas-Métral V. Dumont J.M. Porchet H. Crabbé R. Scalfaro P.

This 14-day Debio 025 treatment (1200 mg orally administered twice daily) was effective against the three genotypes (genotypes 1, 3, and 4) represented in the study. More recently, the anti HCV effect of Debio 025 in combination with peginterferon α 2a (peg-IFNα2a) was investigated in treatment-inexperienced patients with chronic hepatitis C. Debio 025 (600 mg administered once daily) in combination with peg-IFNα2a (180 μg/week) for 4 weeks induced a continuous decay in viral load that reached −4.61 ± 1.88 IU/ml in patients with genotypes 1 and 4 and −5.91 ± 1.11 IU/ml in patients with genotypes 2 and 3 at week 4 (16Flisiak R. Dumont J.M. Crabbé R. Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs. 2007; 16: 1345-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The Debio 025 findings are critical because they suggest that Cyp inhibitors represent a novel class of anti-HCV agents. However, it remains unclear how these compounds control HCV replication. The fact that several recent studies using small RNA interference knockdown approaches suggest that Cyps are critical for the HCV life cycle (9Nakagawa M. Sakamoto N. Enomoto N. Tanabe Y. Kanazawa N.

The discovery 20 years ago of the first cellular protein showing PPIase activity (19Lang K. Schmid F.X. Fischer G. Nature. 1987; 329: 268-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) was entirely unrelated to the discovery of CypA as an intracellular protein possessing a high affinity for CsA (20Handschumacher R.E. Harding M.W. Rice J. Drugge R.J. Speicher D.W. Science. 1984; 226: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1437) Google Scholar). It is only a few years later that Fischer et al. (21Fischer G. Wittmann-Liebold B. Lang K. Kiefhaber T. Schmid F.X. Nature. 1989; 337: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the 18-kDa protein with PPIase activity and CypA represent a single unique protein. All Cyps contain a common domain of 109 amino acids, called the Cyp-like domain, which is surrounded by domains specific to each Cyp members and which dictates their cellular compartmentalization and function (22Wang P. Heitman J. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Bacteria, fungi, insects, plants, and mammals contain Cyps, which all have PPIase activity and are structurally conserved (22Wang P. Heitman J. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). To date, 16 Cyp members have been identified, and 7 of them are found in humans: CypA, CypB, CypC, CypD, CypE, Cyp40, and CypNK (22Wang P. Heitman J. Genome Biol. 2005; 6: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Although there is a growing body of evidence that Cyps control HCV replication in human hepatocytes, a major disagreement currently exists on the respective roles of Cyp members in HCV replication. One study suggests that CypB, but not CypA, is critical for HCV replication (17Watashi K. Ishii N. Hijikata M. Inoue D. Murata T. Miyanari Y. Shimotohno K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 111-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), another suggests that CypA, but not CypB and CypC, is critical for HCV replication (18Yang F. Robotham J.M. Nelson H.B. Irsigler A. Kenworthy R. Tang H. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 5269-5278Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and a third study suggests that three Cyps, CypA, B, and C, are all required for HCV replication (9Nakagawa M. Sakamoto N. Enomoto N. Tanabe Y. Kanazawa N. Koyama T. Kurosaki M. Maekawa S. Yamashiro T. Chen C.H. Itsui Y. Kakinuma S. Watanabe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 313: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Thus, although it becomes evident that Cyps serve as HCV co-factors, their respective contributions and roles in the HCV life cycle remain to be determined. An understanding of the mechanisms that control the Cyp inhibitor-mediated anti-HCV effect is imperative because it will provide new alternate anti-HCV therapies and shed light on the still poorly understood early and late steps of the HCV life cycle.

The primers for reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction were: HCV, 5′-ATGGCGTTAGTATGAGTGTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCATTGAGCGGGTTGATC-3′ (antisense); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GAAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTC-3′ (sense), and 5′-GAAGATGGTGATGGGATTTC-3′ (antisense). Annealed duplex siRNA oligonucleotides contained a 3′-dTdT overhand (Qiagen). siRNA target sequences were: AAGGGTTCCTGCTTTCACAGA for CypA; AAGGTGGAGAGAGCACCAAGACA for CypB; GTGACATCACCACTGGAGATG for CypC; AACCTGCTAAATTGTGCGTTA for CypD; and AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT for control. The cells were transfected with 100 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). For effect of siRNA Cyp knockdown on HCV RNA replication, the cells were transfected with siRNA Cyp and then retransfected 24 h later. An HIV-1-based lentiviral vector was used to express all Cyp shRNA as described previously (24Liu S. Asparuhova M. Brondani V. Ziekau I. Klimkait T. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3752-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Cyp target sequences are the same as those indicated just above. Lentiviral particles production and transduction was conducted as described previously (24Liu S. Asparuhova M. Brondani V. Ziekau I. Klimkait T. Schümperli D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3752-3759Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Generation of stable Cyp knockdown cell lines was obtained after 3 weeks under puromycin (1 μg/ml) selection. All of the cell lines were tested for mycoplasm contamination, which may nonspecifically interfere with HCV replication. To restore CypA expression in Huh7 CypA knockdown cells, a CypA cDNA bearing silent mutations that render it nontargetable by the CypA shRNA was subcloned into pcDNA3 with HindIII and NotI sites to generate pcDNA3- resistant wild-type CypA, which contains an N-terminal HA tag. Using pcDNA3-resistant wild-type CypA as template, we engineered two plasmids carrying either the H126Q (pcDNA3-resistant H126Q CypA) or the R55A (pcDNA3- resistant R55A CypA) mutation in the hydrophobic pocket of CypA that disallows its isomerase activity (25Zydowsky L.D.

Parental or subgenomic HCV Con1-containing Huh7 cells (1 million) treated with or without siRNA or shRNA targeting Cyps were trypsinized and washed twice with 10 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 30 min on ice in 100 μl of lysis buffer (10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× protease inhibitors). The lysates were cleared via centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min in a microcentrifuge. Supernatants (70 μl) were collected and protein concentration of cell lysates measured with a Coomassie-based Bio-Rad kit. The cell lysates were then subjected to Western blotting with antibodies to CypA (26Saphire A.C. Bobardt M.D. Gallay P.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6771-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), CypB (Zymed Laboratories Inc.), CypC (Protein Tech Group, Inc.), CypD (Calbiochem), NS5A (ViroStat), and NS5B (Alexis Biochemicals). Amido Black staining of the membranes confirmed that the loading of samples had been properly normalized. The cellular expression of resistant wild-type, H126Q, or R55A CypA proteins was verified by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies (The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), Antibody Core Facility). For HIV-1 infection, Cyp knockdown Huh7 cells lines were infected with HIV-1-GFP (NL4.3 virus encoding the GFP gene and pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope protein) (generous gift from C. Aiken and D. Gabuzda). Forty-eight hours post-infection, intracellular GFP levels were quantified by FACS. For HSV-1 infection, Cyp knockdown Huh7 cells lines were infected with HSV-1-GFP (K26GFP virus encoding the GFP gene) (generous gift from P. Desai). Forty-eight hours post-infection, intracellular GFP levels were quantified by FACS. For Dengue infection, Cyp knockdown Huh7 cells lines were infected with Dengue-2 (Dengue-2 16681) (generous gift from R. Kinney). Dengue-2 infection was examined using an intracellular FACS staining assay (IFSA). Briefly, IFSA was conducted as described previously (27Kao C.L. Wu M.C. Chiu Y.H. Lin J.L. Wu Y.C. Yueh Y.Y.

Three days post-infection, the cells were washed, trypsinized, resuspended in PBS at 1 × 106/ml, and fixed with 0.2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min on ice. The cells were washed, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.2% Tween for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 2% fetal bovine serum). For intracellular staining, the cells (105) were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with 10 μg/ml of isotype controls, mouse monoclonal anti-Dengue capsid 9A7 IgG (TSRI, Antibody Core Facility). Cell permeabilization was confirmed by staining cells with mouse anti-tubulin IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies). The cells were washed, incubated with secondary phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 4 °C, washed again, resuspended in PBS, fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and stored at 4 °C until FACS analysis. For HCV replication, Cyp knockdown Huh7 cells lines were electroporated with 10 μg of in vitro transcribed genomic Con1 RNA. Seven days post-transfection, HCV infection was quantified by measuring intracellular NS5B levels by IFSA using anti-NS5B IgG (Alexis Biochemicals). CypA-HIV-1 Gag interaction was studied by examining the incorporation of host CypA into budding HIV-1 particles by Western blot. Briefly, HIV-1 particles were transiently expressed in Huh7 cells by GeneJuice (EMD Biosciences) transfection with a mixture of 5 μg of proviral HIV-1 (NL4.3) DNA together with 5 μg of CypA plasmids (pcDNA3-resistant wild-type, H126Q, and R55A plasmids). Viral supernatants, harvested 48 h post-transfection, were filtered through a 0.2-μm-pore size filter to remove cellular debris, pelleted through a sucrose cushion, standardized for HIV-1 capsid content by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Alliance, PerkinElmer), resuspended in 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate loading buffer, and subjected to Western blotting with antibodies directed against the HA tag. Parental Huh7 cells (3 million) were co-transfected with NS5B-Myc (5 μg of DNA) and wild-type CypA-HA or H126Q CypA-HA (5 μg of DNA) plasmids in the presence or absence of Debio 025 (2 μm). Three days post-transfection, the cells were collected and lysed. The cell lysates (1 ml) were precleared for 1 h with 20 μl of agarose beads. Co-immunoprecipitation procedures were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce HA tag IP/Co-IP kit). Bound material was eluted and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA and anti-Myc IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Previous studies suggested that at least three members of the Cyp family, CypA, CypB, and CypC, modulate HCV replication (9Nakagawa M. Sakamoto N. Enomoto N. Tanabe Y. Kanazawa N. Koyama T.

We thus examined whether HCV exploits all of these Cyp members or rather a unique Cyp member to efficiently replicate in human hepatocytes. To address this issue, we knocked down each of these Cyps by transient siRNA interference and examined the effect of the Cyp knockdown on HCV replication. Specifically, Huh7 cells containing the subgenomic HCV Con1 replicon (genotype 1b) were transfected with siRNAs that target either luciferase (control siRNA), CypA (CypA siRNA), CypB (CypB siRNA), CypC (CypC siRNA), or CypD (CypD siRNA). To avoid siRNA toxicity, the cells were washed 24 h post-transfection. Seven days post-transfection, the cells were collected and lysed. To ensure that the siRNA treatments did not nonspecifically influence growth and viability of transfected hepatocytes, the cells were counted and analyzed for trypan blue uptake 7 days post-transfection. We exclusively analyzed the lysates of cells, which gave numbers of viable cells comparable with those of control siRNA-treated cells. The cell lysates were standardized for protein content and analyzed for Cyp content by Western blot using antibodies directed against CypA, CypB, CypC, or CypD. The expression of each Cyp was profoundly reduced by siRNAs Cyp compared with siRNA control (Fig. 1A), demonstrating the efficacy of the siRNA treatments. Moreover, siRNA Cyp treatments were specific because each siRNA Cyp treatment did not alter the expression of the other Cyps (Fig. 1A). For example, the siRNA, which targeted CypA, did not influence CypB, CypC, or CypD expression (Fig. 1A). Importantly, transient CypB, CypC, or CypD knockdown did not significantly influence HCV protein expression. Indeed, NS5A and NS5B levels in siRNA CypB-, CypC-, and CypD-treated hepatocytes were similar to those of control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 1B), suggesting that these Cyps play no or a minor role in HCV protein expression. In sharp contrast, NS5A and NS5B levels were profoundly diminished in hepatocytes treated with the siRNA CypA (Fig. 1B), demonstrating that CypA, rather than CypB, CypC, and CypD, plays a major role in HCV protein expression. We then asked whether CypA, but not other Cyp members, is also critical for HCV RNA replication. To address this issue, naïve Huh7 cells were electroporated with in vitro transcribed genomic Con1 RNA. One day post-electroporation, the cells were transfected with control or siRNA Cyp as described above. Viral RNA replication was monitored for 8 days by analyzing intracellular HCV RNA via reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction as described previously (23Kapadia S.B. Brideau-Andersen A. Chisari F.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2014-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). We verified that the expression of CypA, CypB, CypC, and CypD was knocked down via the Cyp siRNA treatment 8 days post-electroporation (data not shown). We found that the HCV RNA replication in hepatocytes treated with siRNA CypC and CypD was comparable with that in siRNA control-treated cells, whereas the viral RNA replication in siRNA CypB was only slightly diminished (Fig. 1C). In contrast, viral RNA replication was profoundly attenuated in the siRNA CypA-treated cells (Fig. 1C). Altogether these data suggest that CypA, but not CypB, CypC, and CypD, represents an essential host factor for both HCV RNA replication and HCV protein expression. The introduction of siRNA into cultured cells provides a fast and efficient means of knocking down gene expression. However, siRNA has been shown to be effective for only short term gene inhibition in certain mammalian cells. Supporting this notion, we found that although Cyp expression was dramatically reduced 5–7 days after siRNA transfection, Cyp expression recovered 9 or 10 days post-siRNA transfection (data now shown). Even a slight rebound in Cyp protein expression may interfere with the interpretation of the data. To avoid this issue, we conducted experiments similar to those described above but using shRNA to stably silence Cyp gene expression. We constructed plasmids encoding shRNA that target CypA, CypB, or CypC. As above, we constructed as control a plasmid that encodes an shRNA that targets luciferase. Plasmids were packaged into HIV-1-based particles pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus G envelope to permit entry into and infection of hepatocytes. The advantage of using the HIV-1-based vector is that the DNA encoding the shRNA will be stably integrated into the host chromosomes of the hepatocytes. Parental Huh7 cells were exposed to the HIV-1-based particles for 24 h, cultured under puromycin selection for 3 or 4 weeks, and analyzed for Cyp content by Western blot. As expected, CypA, CypB, and CypC levels in shRNA Cyp-transduced cells were severely reduced compared with control shRNA-treated cells (Fig. 2A). We then tested the Cyp knockdown (KD) cell lines for their capacities to support HCV RNA replication as described above. Importantly, the HCV RNA replication was only profoundly reduced in the stable CypA-KD cell line (Fig. 2B), further suggesting that CypA, but not CypB, CypC, and CypD, is essential for HCV replication. It is important to note that we did not observe differences in growth between the cell lines (data not shown), suggesting that these particular Cyps do not play a significant role in Huh7 cell division and multiplication. To further demonstrate the specificity of the CypA requirement for HCV replication, CypA, CypB, and CypC knockdown and control cell lines were exposed to various viruses including HIV-1, HSV-1, the flavivirus Dengue and HCV. Infectivity was scored by measuring the intracellular levels of GFP for both HIV-1 and HSV-1, levels of capsid for Dengue, and levels of NS5B for HCV. GFP levels were significantly reduced in HIV-1-exposed CypA knockdown cells compared with control, CypB- and CypC-KD cells (Fig. 2C, top left panel). This is in accordance with previous studies suggesting that HIV-1 requires CypA to optimally infect human cells (29Franke E.K. Yuan H.E. Luban J. Nature. 1994; 372: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 30Thali M. Bukovsky A. Kondo E. Rosenwirth B. Walsh C.T. Sodroski J. Göttlinger H.G. Nature. 1994; 372: 363-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). All of the cell lines exposed to HSV-1 or Dengue expressed similar levels of GFP (HSV-1) and capsid (Dengue) (Fig. 2C, top right and bottom left panels, respectively), suggesting that HSV-1 and Dengue do no require any of these Cyps to infect human cells. Importantly, NS5B levels were dramatically reduced in the CypA knockdown cells compared with control, CypB and CypC knockdown cells (Fig. 2C). This further suggests that HCV, like HIV-1, specifically exploits CypA to infect and replicate in human cells, more specifically in hepatocytes. The peptide bond generally exists in two"
https://openalex.org/W2069692343,"The Bacteroides are a numerically dominant genus of the human intestinal microbiota. These organisms harbor a rare bacterial pathway for incorporation of exogenous fucose into capsular polysaccharides and glycoproteins. The infrequency of glycoprotein synthesis by bacteria prompted a more detailed analysis of this process. Here, we demonstrate that Bacteroides fragilis has a general O-glycosylation system. The proteins targeted for glycosylation include those predicted to be involved in protein folding, protein-protein interactions, peptide degradation as well as surface lipoproteins. Protein glycosylation is central to the physiology of B. fragilis and is necessary for the organism to competitively colonize the mammalian intestine. We provide evidence that general O-glycosylation systems are conserved among intestinal Bacteroides species and likely contribute to the predominance of Bacteroides in the human intestine."
https://openalex.org/W2052041575,"Adverse conditions can trigger DNA damage as well as DNA repair responses in plants. A variety of stress factors are known to stimulate homologous recombination, the most accurate repair pathway, by increasing the concentration of necessary enzymatic components and the frequency of events. This effect has been reported to last into subsequent generations not exposed to the stress. To establish a basis for a genetic analysis of this transgenerational stress memory, a broad range of treatments was tested for quantitative effects on homologous recombination in the progeny. Several Arabidopsis lines, transgenic for well-established recombination traps, were exposed to 10 different physical and chemical stress treatments, and scored for the number of somatic homologous recombination (SHR) events in the treated generation as well as in the two subsequent generations that were not treated. These numbers were related to the expression level of genes involved in homologous recombination and repair. SHR was enhanced after the majority of treatments, confirming previous data and adding new effective stress types, especially interference with chromatin. Compounds that directly modify DNA stimulated SHR to values exceeding previously described induction rates, concomitant with an induction of genes involved in SHR. In spite of the significant stimulation in the stressed generations, the two subsequent non-treated generations only showed a low and stochastic increase in SHR that did not correlate with the degree of stimulation in the parental plants. Transcripts coding for SHR enzymes generally returned to pre-treatment levels in the progeny. Thus, transgenerational effects on SHR frequency are not a general response to abiotic stress in Arabidopsis and may require special conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2139273581,"Many bacterial pathogens and symbionts utilize type III secretion systems to deliver bacterial effector proteins into host cells. These effector proteins have the capacity to modulate a large variety of cellular functions in a highly regulated manner. Here, we report that the phosphoinositide phosphatase SopB, a Salmonella Typhimurium type III secreted effector protein, diversifies its function by localizing to different cellular compartments in a ubiquitin-dependent manner. We show that SopB utilizes the same enzymatic activity to modulate actin-mediated bacterial internalization and Akt activation at the plasma membrane and vesicular trafficking and intracellular bacterial replication at the phagosome. Thus, by exploiting the host cellular machinery, Salmonella Typhimurium has evolved the capacity to broaden the functional repertoire of a virulence factor to maximize its ability to modulate cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1981793562,"It is becoming increasingly apparent that Staphylococcus aureus are able to survive engulfment by macrophages, and that the intracellular environment of these host cells, which is essential to innate host defenses against invading microorganisms, may in fact provide a refuge for staphylococcal survival and dissemination. Based on this, we postulated that S. aureus might induce cytoprotective mechanisms by changing gene expression profiles inside macrophages similar to obligate intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To validate our hypothesis we first ascertained whether S. aureus infection could affect programmed cell death in human (hMDMs) and mouse (RAW 264.7) macrophages and, specifically, protect these cells against apoptosis. Our findings indicate that S. aureus-infected macrophages are more resistant to staurosporine-induced cell death than control cells, an effect partly mediated via the inhibition of cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis of human monocyte-derived macrophages during S. aureus infection revealed a significant increase in the expression of antiapoptotic genes. This was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of selected genes involved in mitochondria-dependent cell death, clearly showing overexpression of BCL2 and MCL1. Cumulatively, the results of our experiments argue that S. aureus is able to induce a cytoprotective effect in macrophages derived from different mammal species, which can prevent host cell elimination, and thus allow intracellular bacterial survival. Ultimately, it is our contention that this process may contribute to the systemic dissemination of S. aureus infection."
https://openalex.org/W2172140364,"Hemopressin (Hp), a 9-residue α-hemoglobin-derived peptide, was previously reported to function as a CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist (1). In this study, we report that mass spectrometry (MS) data from peptidomics analyses of mouse brain extracts identified N-terminally extended forms of Hp containing either three (RVD-Hpa) or two (VD-Hpa) additional amino acids, as well as a β-hemoglobin-derived peptide with sequence similarity to that of hemopressin (VD-Hpβ). Characterization of the α-hemoglobin-derived peptides using binding and functional assays shows that in contrast to Hp, which functions as a CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist, both RVD-Hpa and VD-Hpα function as agonists. Studies examining the increase in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 levels or release of intracellular Ca2+ indicate that these peptides activate a signal transduction pathway distinct from that activated by the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol, or the classic CB1 agonist, Hu-210. This finding suggests an additional mode of regulation of endogenous cannabinoid receptor activity. Taken together, these results suggest that the CB1 receptor is involved in the integration of signals from both lipid- and peptide-derived signaling molecules.—Gomes, I., Grushko, J.

https://openalex.org/W1997473201,"Nociceptive stimuli may evoke brain responses longer than the stimulus duration often partially detected by conventional neuroimaging. Fibromyalgia patients typically complain of severe pain from gentle stimuli. We aimed to characterize brain response to painful pressure in fibromyalgia patients by generating activation maps adjusted for the duration of brain responses.Twenty-seven women (mean age: 47.8 years) were assessed with fMRI. The sample included nine fibromyalgia patients and nine healthy subjects who received 4 kg/cm(2) of pressure on the thumb. Nine additional control subjects received 6.8 kg/cm(2) to match the patients for the severity of perceived pain. Independent Component Analysis characterized the temporal dynamics of the actual brain response to pressure. Statistical parametric maps were estimated using the obtained time courses. Brain response to pressure (18 seconds) consistently exceeded the stimulus application (9 seconds) in somatosensory regions in all groups. fMRI maps following such temporal dynamics showed a complete pain network response (sensory-motor cortices, operculo-insula, cingulate cortex, and basal ganglia) to 4 kg/cm(2) of pressure in fibromyalgia patients. In healthy subjects, response to this low intensity pressure involved mainly somatosensory cortices. When matched for perceived pain (6.8 kg/cm(2)), control subjects showed also comprehensive activation of pain-related regions, but fibromyalgia patients showed significantly larger activation in the anterior insula-basal ganglia complex and the cingulate cortex.The results suggest that data-driven fMRI assessments may complement conventional neuroimaging for characterizing pain responses and that enhancement of brain activation in fibromyalgia patients may be particularly relevant in emotion-related regions."

Overexpression of ten of these factors resulted in an increased repopulating activity compared to unmanipulated cells. Interestingly, at least four of the 18 factors, Fos, Tcfec, Hmgb1, and Sfpi1, show non-cell-autonomous functions.

We developed a new therapeutic strategy to target bone metastases and calcified neoplasms using combined polymer-bound angiogenesis inhibitors. Using an advanced ""living polymerization"" technique, the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT), we conjugated the aminobisphosphonate alendronate (ALN), and the potent anti-angiogenic agent TNP-470 with N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer through a Glycine-Glycine-Proline-Norleucine linker, cleaved by cathepsin K, a cysteine protease overexpressed at resorption sites in bone tissues. In this approach, dual targeting is achieved. Passive accumulation is possible due to the increase in molecular weight following polymer conjugation of the drugs, thus extravasating from the tumor leaky vessels and not from normal healthy vessels. Active targeting to the calcified tissues is achieved by ALN's affinity to bone mineral.The anti-angiogenic and antitumor potency of HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. We show that free and conjugated ALN-TNP-470 have synergistic anti-angiogenic and antitumor activity by inhibiting proliferation, migration and capillary-like tube formation of endothelial and human osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Evaluation of anti-angiogenic, antitumor activity and body distribution of HPMA copolymer-ALN-TNP-470 conjugate was performed on severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) male mice inoculated with mCherry-labeled MG-63-Ras human osteosarcoma and by modified Miles permeability assay. Our targeted bi-specific conjugate reduced VEGF-induced vascular hyperpermeability by 92% and remarkably inhibited osteosarcoma growth in mice by 96%.This is the first report to describe a new concept of a narrowly-dispersed combined polymer therapeutic designed to target both tumor and endothelial compartments of bone metastases and calcified neoplasms at a single administration. This new approach of co-delivery of two synergistic drugs may have clinical utility as a potential therapy for angiogenesis-dependent cancers such as osteosarcoma and bone metastases."

In contrast to the EAATs, transport via GltPh is independent of H+ and K+. We propose a kinetic model of transport in which at least two Na+ ions are coupled to the cotransport of each aspartate molecule by GltPh, and where an ion- and substrate-free transporter reorients to complete the transport cycle.

Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system; it activates a wide range of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors to generate synaptic responses. The extracellular glutamate concentration is controlled by a family of specific transport proteins, the EAATs 3The abbreviations used are: EAATexcitatory amino acid transporterTBOAdl-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartateTetrakistetrakis(2-hydroxyethyl)ammoniumNMDGN-methyl-d-glucamineChcholine.

The detailed mechanism of ion coupling and glutamate transport by the EAATs remains unclear; complementary methods are required to understand the physical/chemical features of the transport mechanism. A recent crystal structure of a homolog of the glutamate transporter family from Pyrococcus horikoshii (GltPh) revealed its complex transmembrane topology (9Yernool D. Boudker O. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Nature. 2004; 431: 811-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). GltPh shares about 36% amino acid identity with the EAATs.

To fully understand the mechanistic implications of the GltPh structure, we must first understand the basic functional properties of the transporter. Only those mechanistic features that are conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologs can be understood in detail by analyzing GltPh as a model structure. This sort of functional analysis of GltPh remains at a preliminary stage. An emerging consensus is that GltPh functions as a Na+-dependent aspartate transporter (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 24Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), although a single report suggests that the protein is H+-dependent glutamate transporter (25Raunser S. Appel M. Ganea C. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Fendler K. Kühlbrandt W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12796-12805Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that, like the EAATs, GltPh carries an uncoupled Cl− conductance, and its transport is electrogenic (24Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, its dependence of transport on other ionic species has not yet been examined. Boudker et al. (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) reported an analysis of Na+ dependence of aspartate binding to detergent-solubilized GltPh protein, but the dependence of transport on substrate and Na+ concentration has not yet been analyzed. This is an important distinction, as the conditions most favorable for substrate binding to the transporter in isolation may be quite different from those required for optimal transport. Here we sought to characterize in detail the ionic and substrate requirements for transport in GltPh, measuring transport kinetics of reconstituted protein in a wide range of conditions to determine which features of the GltPh transport mechanism are shared with the EAATs. We also performed a comprehensive analysis of substrate specificity. We demonstrate that GltPh is a Na+-dependent, highly aspartate-selective transporter. We also show that, in contrast to the EAATs, H+ and K+ are not coupled to aspartate transport by GltPh; based on these results we suggest a simple model for the GltPh transport cycle. Single cysteine residues were introduced using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) into a GltPh mutant in which the single native cysteine (Cys-321) had been mutated to a serine (C321S). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing of both DNA strands (NINDS Sequencing Facility, National Institutes of Health). GltPh protein was purified essentially as described elsewhere (24Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Membranes were isolated, solubilized with n-dodecyl β-d-maltopyranoside (Anatrace), and protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The histidine tag was subsequently removed by digestion with thrombin (10 units/mg protein), and the protein was further purified on a size exclusion column where the detergent was exchanged to n-decyl β-d-maltopyranoside (Anatrace). Pure protein was reconstituted into liposomes as described previously (26Gaillard I. Slotboom D.J. Knol J. Lolkema J.S. Konings W.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6150-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, Escherichia coli polar lipids and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids), at a ratio of 3:1, were mixed, dried under nitrogen, and resuspended in 100 mm KPi, pH 7.4, or the appropriate inside solution as indicated. Liposomes were formed by extrusion through 400 nm membranes (Avanti Polar Lipids) and were treated with Triton X-100 (Anatrace) at a 0.5:1 (w/w) detergent to lipid ratio prior to the addition of protein at 0.25–3 μg of protein/mg of lipid. The protein/lipid was left at room temperature for 30 min before detergent was removed using SM2 Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) that had been extensively prewashed with methanol and water. The protein/lipid mixture was incubated, with gentle agitation, with three consecutive batches of the Bio-Beads (80 mg/ml) as follows: the first batch for 2 h at room temperature, the second batch for 2 h at 4 °C, and the third batch overnight at 4 °C. Bio-Beads were removed by filtration. Proteoliposomes were concentrated, resuspended at 100 mg of lipid/ml (0.3–5.0 mg protein/ml), and either used immediately or flash-frozen in a dry ice/EtOH bath and stored at −80 °C. Generally, proteoliposomes were loaded by freeze/thaw and extrusion with 100 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and the uptake reaction was initiated by diluting the proteoliposomes (100 mg of lipid/ml) 133-fold into reaction buffer pre-warmed to 30 °C, or as indicated for the temperature experiment. The reaction buffer contained the following: 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 μm valinomycin (except for experiments shown in Fig. 5, see below) and 100 nm, or 1 μm where indicated, l-[3H]aspartate or l-[3H]glutamate (GE Healthcare). ChCl was used to maintain ionic and osmotic strength where appropriate. The intraliposomal cation dependence of GltPh was examined by replacing the KCl in the inside buffer with 100 mm of the chloride salts Rb+, Cs+, Ch+, tetrakis+, NMDG+, or 200 mm sorbitol; uptake was measured in the absence of valinomycin. Background levels of l-[3H]aspartate uptake in protein-free liposomes or in GltPh-liposomes with equimolar K+ or Na+ on either side of the membrane were indistinguishable from one another (data not shown). At each time point, a 200-μl aliquot was removed and diluted 10-fold into ice-cold quench buffer (100 mm LiCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5), followed by immediate filtration over nitrocellulose filters (0.22 μm pore size, Millipore). The filters were washed once with 2 ml of ice-cold quench buffer and assayed for radioactivity using a Trilux beta counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). All initial rates were calculated from the linear portion of the curve (first 30 s), and all data represent the means ± S.E. of at least three experiments. Uptake data are fit to single exponentials for presentation. The efflux assay was performed by first loading the liposomes with l-[3H]aspartate; GltPh-liposomes containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 1 μm unlabeled l-aspartate were diluted 20-fold into loading buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 400 nml-[3H]aspartate) and incubated for 3 h at 30 °C. Because K+ is replaced with other ions in these experiments, no valinomycin was added; transport-generated voltages were dissipated by the intrinsic Cl− conductance of GltPh (24Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Efflux experiments were initiated by a 14-fold dilution of GltPh-liposomes into efflux buffer at 22 °C (100 mm NaCl, KCl, ChCl, or 200 mm sorbitol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). For counterflow experiments, GltPh-liposomes containing 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and either 1 μml-aspartate or 1 mml-glutamate were diluted 133-fold into buffer at 30 °C (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 200 nml-[3H]aspartate). For both efflux and counterflow, a 200-μl aliquot was taken at each time point and diluted 10-fold into ice-cold quench buffer, followed by immediate filtration over nitrocellulose filters as described above. For the efflux experiment, background counts (taken with protein-free liposomes) were subtracted from the raw data, which were then normalized to the 5-s time point to account for variation in the efficiency of l-[3H]aspartate loading. This background subtraction had no qualitative effect on the results. The correction was never more than 10% of the initial value. Proteoliposomes containing GltPh were incubated with fluorescein-5-maleimide (Molecular Probes) at a protein/label ratio of 1:1000 for 8 min in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES/Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mml-aspartate. Triton X-100 was added at a 2.5 (w/w) detergent to lipid ratio to solubilize the vesicles either before or after the labeling reaction. The reaction was quenched by addition of l-cysteine at a 1:10 ratio of label to cysteine. Protein was removed from free label by addition of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads and 40 mm imidazole to solubilized proteoliposomes; the beads were washed twice, protein eluted with 250 mm imidazole, and then run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Fluorescent labeling was visualized on a UV transilluminator and then the protein stained with Coomassie Blue (Invitrogen Simply SafeStain Blue) and visualized by white light illumination. The aim of this study was to characterize the transport mechanism of GltPh in detail to understand the ion dependence of transport and to determine which mechanistic features are conserved between this bacterial homolog and the human glutamate transporters. To this end, we performed transport assays on purified GltPh protein reconstituted into liposomes. To effectively interpret kinetic studies of transport in reconstituted protein, one must first assess the orientation of the protein in the liposome membrane. If the protein is uniformly oriented then detailed kinetic measurements can provide insight into specific steps in the transport cycle. Alternatively, if the protein reconstitutes into vesicles with mixed orientations, then under a given set of ionic gradients a subset of individual proteins, oriented one way around, will transit the transport cycle in the opposite direction compared with the proteins oriented the other way around. In this case, ion dependence of transport can be examined, but detailed kinetic analysis is more difficult. We analyzed the orientation of reconstituted GltPh by taking advantage of our ability to specifically label introduced cysteines on the protein with a maleimide-coupled fluorescent probe. GltPh has a single native cysteine, which can be removed without noticeably changing the functional properties of the protein (data not shown). Into this “Cys-less” GltPh, we introduced cysteines individually at positions predicted by the crystal structure to be exposed either on the intracellular (S72C) or extracellular (G34C) face of the protein. If the protein is uniformly oriented in the membrane, then when in liposomes either all or none of a given cysteine will be accessible and thereby labeled by the aqueous reagent. Alternatively, if there is a mix of orientations then a fraction of the protein will be labeled. In this case, adding detergent to permeabilize the liposomes before addition of the fluorescent probe will result in increased labeling as the otherwise protected cysteines inside the liposomes become accessible to the aqueous reagent. The outcome of this labeling procedure for a uniformly oriented protein will vary depending on the orientation; if all of the introduced cysteines are outside, all will label in unpermeabilized vesicles; alternatively, if the cysteines are all on the inside, none will label in unpermeabilized vesicles, but all will label after permeabilization. Running the protein on a polyacrylamide gel and exciting the fluorescent probe provides a convenient semi-quantitative assay for the extent of labeling; the same gel can be stained with Coomassie Blue after imaging to allow for corrections based upon the amount of protein loaded. In detergent-solubilized protein, both internal and external sites react well with the fluorescent probe (data not shown). Our experiments reveal a reactivity pattern that demonstrates a mixed set of orientations for GltPh in liposomes. Cys-less, C321S, protein is minimally labeled by fluorescein maleimide under these conditions, demonstrating that the labeling reaction is specific for cysteine (Fig. 1A, top image, right lanes). Both for the external site (Fig. 1A, top image, middle lanes) and the internal site (Fig. 1A, top image, left lanes), we observe significant labeling by the probe with GltPh in intact liposomes, as well as a substantial increase in labeling upon permeabilization and labeling. Staining the same gel with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1A, bottom image) verifies consistent loading of protein. These results clearly establish that the protein is present in liposomes in both possible orientations. Our method for protein reconstitution is derived from that of Rigaud, in which pre-formed lipid vesicles are incubated with enough detergent to incorporate into the vesicle membrane without completely solubilizing it (27Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The concentration of detergent added in this protocol is guided by the light-scattering properties of the sample (Fig. 1B). At low concentrations of detergent the scattering increases as the liposomes swell due to detergent molecules intercalating into the bilayer; higher concentrations of detergent start to dissolve the bilayer and reduce the amount of scattering. We initially obtained these results with liposomes that had been substantially solubilized with Triton X-100 before adding protein (0.5 (w/w) detergent/lipid; see asterisk on light-scattering curve in Fig. 1B). We reasoned that it might be possible to obtain a more uniformly oriented population of transporters by reconstituting at lower concentrations of added detergent. However, we obtain similar results with protein added to liposomes solubilized with substantially lower concentrations of Triton (Fig. 1C, top image), including with no added detergent (besides that in the protein solution). These results suggest that the detergent carried in micelles with the GltPh protein is sufficient to promote its incorporation into a lipid bilayer membrane and that this incorporation is equally efficacious in either orientation. In this context, detailed kinetic analysis of transport is not feasible; however, examinations of the ionic dependence and specificity of transport can be performed to better understand the mechanism of transport by GltPh. As reported previously, in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient, but no H+ gradient, we observe robust uptake of l-[3H]aspartate (125-fold over background), whereas levels of l-[3H]glutamate uptake are indistinguishable from background (Fig. 2A). These results agree with that of Boudker et al. (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar), who did not observe any appreciable glutamate uptake over background in the same conditions. A dose response of the initial rate of l-[3H]aspartate uptake reveals an apparent Km for transport of 120 ± 30 nm, Hill coefficient of 1.0 ± 0.1, and Vmax of 3.7 ± 0.3 nmol/mg protein/min (Fig. 2B). The half-saturation of aspartate transport rate (Km) is ∼100-fold lower than the Kd value reported for aspartate binding to GltPh, consistent with a slow off-rate of binding, which is likely to be comparable with the rate of transport (see “Discussion”). A Hill coefficient of ∼1 agrees well with binding results (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and suggests independence of substrate translocation pathways in each protomer of the trimeric complex. Studies have reported similar Hill coefficient values for the EAATs (28Grewer C. Balani P. Weidenfeller C. Bartusel T. Tao Z. Rauen T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11913-11923Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Koch H.P. Larsson H.P. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 1730-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), supporting the hypothesis that the fundamental transport mechanism is conserved. To further investigate the substrate specificity of GltPh, we performed competition experiments, measuring uptake of l-[3H]aspartate in the presence of 100-fold excesses of a series of unlabeled amino acids. Of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, only aspartate itself competes successfully with l-[3H]aspartate uptake, with its l-isomer a slightly better competitor than its d-isomer (Fig. 2C). We also measured aspartate uptake in the presence of several known transportable and nontransportable inhibitors of the EAATs. At concentrations 100-fold over l-[3H]aspartate, only two of the tested compounds, TBOA and cysteate, significantly inhibited aspartate transport via GltPh (Fig. 2C). TBOA, an analog of aspartate, is a selective competitive inhibitor of the EAATs (30Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar), which also inhibits aspartate transport by GltPh (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). At a concentration of 10 μm, we also observed ∼70% inhibition of l-[3H]aspartate transport by TBOA. Cysteate, an EAAT substrate (2Slotboom D.J. Konings W.N. Lolkema J.S. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 293-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), inhibits l-[3H]aspartate transport by ∼40%, an observation consistent with the binding measurements of Boudker et al. (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) obtained using the similar compound, l-cysteinesulfinic acid. None of the other compounds we tested significantly inhibited aspartate transport. A recent paper by Raunser and colleagues (25Raunser S. Appel M. Ganea C. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Fendler K. Kühlbrandt W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12796-12805Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reports that GltPh is a glutamate transporter that can be driven by gradients of either Na+ or H+. In contrast to their results, we do not observe detectable uptake of l-[3H]glutamate in the presence of a Na+ gradient (at symmetric pH 7.5, Fig. 2A). Furthermore, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled glutamate does not compete with l-[3H]aspartate transport via GltPh (Fig. 2C). Thus, in our hands, a Na+ gradient alone cannot support glutamate transport via GltPh. For the mammalian glutamate transporters, three Na+ ions are coupled to the transport of each glutamate (3Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To assess the coupling ratio of Na+ to aspartate transport via GltPh, we measured l-[3H]aspartate uptake rates in the presence of varying Na+ and aspartate concentrations. We observe a strong dependence of transport on [Na+]out, with a Km for Na+ of 3.9 ± 0.2 mm with a Hill coefficient of 2.4 ± 0.3 at 0.1 μm aspartate and a Km of 2.0 ± 0.2 mm with a Hill coefficient of 2.6 ± 0.6 at 1 μm aspartate (Fig. 3). These values complement the values obtained from binding studies (14Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) and are consistent with the idea that, in addition to binding, at least two Na+ ions are also coupled to the transport of each aspartate molecule. They also complement our previous finding that transport by GltPh is electrogenic (24Ryan R.M. Mindell J.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); because aspartate carries a net single negative charge, the protein must cotransport at least two positive charges. Concentrated efforts to determine a more precise stoichiometry of Na+-coupled transport have been unsuccessful. Glutamate transport via the EAATs is also coupled to the cotransport of one H+ (3Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). To test if transport via GltPh is similarly coupled to H+, we measured Na+-driven l-[3H]aspartate uptake in the presence of various pH gradients. Aspartate uptake in the presence of an inwardly directed H+ gradient (pH 7.5 in, 5 out) is unchanged compared with that measured in the absence of a H+-driving force (symmetrical pH 7.5, Fig. 4A). The initial rate of aspartate transport measured at a broad range of outside pH values (Fig. 4B) reveals a minimal pH dependence of transport, with a slight decrease at pH 8.5 and above. In addition, a H+ gradient alone also does not support aspartate transport (Fig. 4C). If, as in the EAATs, a H+ was coupled to transport, we would expect to observe substantial increases in aspartate uptake with increasing [H+]out. In contrast to the EAATs, several other bacterial transporters are known to be coupled to the countertransport of one or more H+ (30Accardi A. Miller C. Nature. 2004; 427: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). To test if transport by GltPh was coupled to the countertransport of H+, we changed the pH inside the liposome to create an outward (pH 5.5 in, 7.5 out) or inward (pH 8.5 in, 7.5 out) H+ gradient. Aspartate transport was unchanged in these different H+ gradients (data not shown). Our results are thus inconsistent with H+-coupling of GltPh transport in either direction. On face value it is difficult to harmonize our data with the results of Raunser et al. (25Raunser S. Appel M. Ganea C. Geldmacher-Kaufer U. Fendler K. Kühlbrandt W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12796-12805Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We considered the possibility that, in contrast to its Na+-dependent aspartate transport, GltPh could utilize a H+ gradient to drive glutamate (instead of aspartate) into liposomes. On the scale of Fig. 4A, we do not observe any noticeable glutamate uptake by GltPh in the presence of an inwardly directed H+ gradient (pH 7.5 in, 5 out) either alone or in addition to a Na+ gradient (Fig. 4A). However, close examination of the glutamate uptake data from Fig. 4A (Fig. 4C, note expanded scale) reveals that a minute amount of glutamate uptake does indeed occur in our system; its level is ∼3-fold over background, in contrast to the level of aspartate uptake, which is ∼125-fold over background. This level of uptake is of similar magnitude"
https://openalex.org/W1976073075,"C-type lectins (CTLs) are a family of proteins that share a common structural motif, the carbohydrate recognition domain, and may act as receptors in pathogen recognition. Indeed, some vertebrate CTLs, particularly the collectins, are unequivocally implicated in the innate immune response to certain microbes. Although studies in insects and other invertebrates have described CTL activation of effector immune responses in vitro, the contribution of these CTLs to immune defenses in vivo is still poorly understood. Here we report that two CTLs, CTL4 and CTLMA2, which were shown previously to inhibit Plasmodium berghei ookinete melanization in the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae, are transcriptionally induced by bacterial challenge. Using in vivo reverse genetic analysis, we show that both CTLs are required for the clearance of Escherichia coli, but not Staphylococcus aureus, from adult female mosquitoes. Silencing either CTL dramatically reduces mosquito survival to Gram-negative but not to Gram-positive bacterial infections, suggesting a role in defense against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, molecular characterization reveals that both CTLs are secreted into the mosquito hemolymph mainly in the form of a disulfide-linked heterodimer. This association explains the similar roles of these CTLs in bacterial defense as well as in the melanization response to P. berghei ookinetes. Apparently, CTL4 and CTLMA2 serve pleiotropic functions in the innate immune response of A. gambiae."

To decipher the mechanisms accounting for the cross-talk between bacteria/soluble factors and intestinal epithelium, we measured the capacity of the bacteria, its conditioned medium (Bb-CM) and other Gram(+) commensal bacteria to dampen inflammatory chemokine secretion. Methods TNFα-induced chemokine (CXCL8) secretion and alteration of NF-κB and AP-1 signalling pathways by Bb were studied by EMSA, confocal microscopy and western blotting. Anti-inflammatory capacity was also tested in vivo in a model of TNBS-induced colitis in mice. Results Bb and Bb-CM, but not other commensal bacteria, induced a time and dose-dependent inhibition of CXCL8 secretion by epithelial cells driven by both AP-1 and NF-κB transcription pathways and implying decreased phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and IκB-α molecules. In TNBS-induced colitis in mice, Bb-CM decreased the colitis score and inflammatory cytokine expression, an effect reproduced by dendritic cell conditioning with Bb-CM. Conclusions Bb and secreted soluble factors contribute positively to intestinal homeostasis by attenuating chemokine production. The results indicate that Bb down regulate inflammation at the epithelial level by inhibiting phosphorylations involved in inflammatory processes and by protective conditioning of dendritic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2058064766,"Due to increasing resistance development among bacteria, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are receiving increased attention. Ideally, AMP should display high bactericidal potency, but low toxicity against (human) eukaryotic cells. Additionally, short and proteolytically stable AMPs are desired to maximize bioavailability and therapeutic versatility.A facile approach is demonstrated for reaching high potency of ultra-short antimicrobal peptides through end-tagging with W and F stretches. Focusing on a peptide derived from kininogen, KNKGKKNGKH (KNK10) and truncations thereof, end-tagging resulted in enhanced bactericidal effect against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Through end-tagging, potency and salt resistance could be maintained down to 4-7 amino acids in the hydrophilic template peptide. Although tagging resulted in increased eukaryotic cell permeabilization at low ionic strength, the latter was insignificant at physiological ionic strength and in the presence of serum. Quantitatively, the most potent peptides investigated displayed bactericidal effects comparable to, or in excess of, that of the benchmark antimicrobial peptide LL-37. The higher bactericidal potency of the tagged peptides correlated to a higher degree of binding to bacteria, and resulting bacterial wall rupture. Analogously, tagging enhanced peptide-induced rupture of liposomes, particularly anionic ones. Additionally, end-tagging facilitated binding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, both effects probably contributing to the selectivity displayed by these peptides between bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Importantly, W-tagging resulted in peptides with maintained stability against proteolytic degradation by human leukocyte elastase, as well as staphylococcal aureolysin and V8 proteinase. The biological relevance of these findings was demonstrated ex vivo for pig skin infected by S. aureus and E. coli.End-tagging by hydrophobic amino acid stretches may be employed to enhance bactericidal potency also of ultra-short AMPs at maintained limited toxicity. The approach is of general applicability, and facilitates straightforward synthesis of hydrophobically modified AMPs without the need for post-peptide synthesis modifications."

Ac-APR-1 from the dog hookworm, Ancylostoma caninum, protects dogs against hookworm infection via antibodies that neutralize enzymatic activity and interrupt blood-feeding. Toward developing a human hookworm vaccine, we expressed both wild-type (Na-APR-1wt) and mutant (Na-APR-1mut—mutagenesis of the catalytic aspartic acids) forms of Na-APR-1 from the human hookworm, Necator americanus. Refolded Na-APR-1wt was catalytically active, and Na-APR-1mut was catalytically inactive but still bound substrates. Vaccination of canines with Na-APR-1mut and heterologous challenge with A. caninum resulted in significantly reduced parasite egg burdens (P=0.034) and weight loss (P=0.022). Vaccinated dogs also had less gut pathology, fewer adult worms, and reduced blood loss compared to controls but these did not reach statistical significance. Vaccination with Na-APR-1mut induced antibodies that bound the native enzyme in the parasite gut and neutralized enzymatic activity of Na-APR-1wt and APR-1 orthologues from three other hookworm species that infect humans. IgG1 against Na-APR-1mut was the most prominently detected antibody in sera from people resident in high-transmission areas for N. americanus, indicating that natural boosting may occur in exposed humans. Na-APR-1mut is now a lead antigen for the development of an antihematophagy vaccine for human hookworm disease.—Pearson, M. S., Bethony, J. M., Pickering, D. A., de Oliveira, L.

https://openalex.org/W2000378779,"Background We recently showed that freeze-dried cells stored for 3 years at room temperature can direct embryonic development following cloning. However, viability, as evaluated by membrane integrity of the cells after freeze-drying, was very low; and it was mainly the DNA integrity that was preserved. In the present study, we improved the cells' viability and functionality after freeze-drying. Methodology/Principal Findings We optimized the conditions of directional freezing, i.e. interface velocity and cell concentration, and we added the antioxidant EGCG to the freezing solution. The study was performed on mononuclear cells (MNCs) derived from human umbilical cord blood. After freeze-drying, we tested the viability, number of CD34+-presenting cells and ability of the rehydrated hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate into different blood cells in culture. The viability of the MNCs after freeze-drying and rehydration with pure water was 88%–91%. The total number of CD34+-presenting cells and the number of colonies did not change significantly when evaluated before freezing, after freeze-thawing, and after freeze-drying (5.4×104±4.7, 3.49×104±6 and 6.31×104±12.27 cells, respectively, and 31±25.15, 47±45.8 and 23.44±13.3 colonies, respectively). Conclusions This is the first report of nucleated cells which have been dried and then rehydrated with double-distilled water remaining viable, and of hematopoietic stem cells retaining their ability to differentiate into different blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W2030331321,"We found that ZBTB2, a POK family transcription factor, is a potent repressor of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway important in cell cycle regulation. ZBTB2 repressed transcription of the ARF, p53, and p21 genes, but activated the HDM2 gene. In particular, ZBTB2 repressed transcription of the p21 gene by acting on the two distal p53 binding elements and the proximal Sp1 binding GC-box 5/6 elements. ZBTB2 directly interacted with Sp1 via its POZ domain and zinc fingers, which was important in the repression of transcription activation by Sp1. ZBTB2 and Sp1 competed with each other in binding to the GC-box 5/6 elements and the two p53 binding elements. ZBTB2 directly interacted with p53 via its zinc fingers, inhibiting p53 binding and repressing transcription activation by p53. The POZ domain, required for transcription repression, interacted with corepressors such as BCoR, NCoR, and SMRT. The interactions deacetylated histones Ac-H3 and -H4 at the proximal promoter. Although ectopic ZBTB2 stimulated cell proliferation, knock-down of ZBTB2 expression decreased cell proliferation and DNA synthesis. Overall, our data suggest that ZBTB2 is a potential proto-oncogenic master control gene of the p53 pathway and, in particular, is a potent transcription repressor of the cell cycle arrest gene p21 by inhibiting p53 and Sp1."

The importance of PML NB structural integrity was first revealed in acute promyelocytic leukemia because, in this malignancy, the abnormal fusion protein PML/RARα leads to NB disruption. Patient treatment with As2O3 induces the reversion of the acute promyelocytic leukemia phenotype as well as PML/RARα degradation and PML NB reformation (4Zhu J. Koken M.H. Quignon F. Chelbi-Alix M.K.

PML is a target for the post-translational modification by SUMO, an ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently coupled to PML lysine residues 65, 160, and 490 via a process called sumoylation (5Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar, 6Kamitani T. Kito K. Nguyen H.P. Wada H. Fukuda-Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. J. Biol.

Among the four human SUMO paralogs identified, SUMO1, -2, and -3 were found to be conjugated to target proteins. It involves an enzymatic cascade for the transfer of the mature SUMO and the formation of an isopeptide bond between the COOH-terminal glycine of SUMO and a lysine from the target protein. Sumoylation is a reversible process due to the existence of several deconjugating enzymes. PML NB formation requires both the covalent linkage (sumoylation) (reviewed in Ref. 7Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7243-7249Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and the non-covalent interactions of SUMO with PML through a SUMO binding domain (SBD also named SIM for SUMO interacting motif) (8Shen T.H. Lin H.K. Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Pandolfi P.P. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 331-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PML SBD contains specific serines, acting as substrates for the caseine kinase-2 (CK2), which are implicated in PML ubiquitination and degradation (9Scaglioni P.P. Yung T.M. Cai L.F.

Cell. 2006; 126: 269-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) and which phosphorylation status could regulate the function of the SBD. Because sumoylation of proteins is dynamic and reversible, this post-translational modification is difficult to follow in vivo and its detection mainly relies on the identification of sumoylated protein species by Western blot following cell lysis. Recently, we used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) to detect covalent linkage of ubiquitin (ubiquitination) in living mammalian cells and in real time (10Perroy J. Pontier S. Charest P.G. Aubry M. Bouvier M. Nat. Methods. 2004; 1: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In brief, BRET monitors the interaction between a protein fused to a luciferase and a protein fused to yellow or green fluorescent protein (YFP or GFP), upon addition of a luciferase substrate; it is a proximity-based assay that requires that the donor of energy (luciferase fusion) and the acceptor (YFP or GFP fusions) are within 50 to 100 Å for an efficient energy transfer (11Xu Y.

However, a demonstration that BRET may provide a method of choice to follow the dynamics of protein sumoylation in living cells is lacking. Here, we developed a sensitive and quantitative SUMO BRET assay for the detection of PML interactions with SUMO in living cells. We proved that BRET can be used to detect both SUMO covalent and non-covalent interactions with PML (model, Fig. 1H). For this purpose, we used the PMLIII isoform in which sumoylation is induced by As2O3 and triggers a proteasome-dependent PML degradation (14Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. Puvion F. Koken M. Honoré N. Doubeikovsky A. Duprez E. Pandolfi P.P. Puvion E. Freemont P. de Thé H. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1361-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar); the degradation process involves the ubiquitination of poly-SUMO covalently coupled to PML by the poly-SUMO-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF4 (15Lallemand-Breitenbach V.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Altogether, our BRET results indicate that, As2O3 and/or RNF4-induced PML degradation are dependent on the integrity of both PML sumoylation target sites and the PML SBD core sequence but not on the CK2 serine phosphorylation sites within the SBD. However, phosphorylation of these serines is required for most PML SBD-dependent non-covalent interactions. This phospho-regulation of PML SBD (“SBD phospho-switch”) establishes another link between the phosphorylation and SUMO, different from the phospho-sumoyl switch (18Yang X.J. Grégoire S. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 779-786Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The sequence of all cDNA constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

PML3KR was obtained by mutating sequentially Lys-65, Lys-160, and Lys-490 to Arg residues to generate PMLK65R, PMLK65R,K160R, and PMLK65R,K160R,K490R (PML3KR). Then, PML3KR-SBD and PML3KR-S560A,S561A,S562A,565A mutants were obtained using PML3KR as a matrix by mutating either the four hydrophobic residues from the SBD (VVVI) (8Shen T.H. Lin H.K.

PMLΔCC was constructed by replacing a 411-bp fragment coding for the PML III coiled-coil domain (nucleotides 669 to 1069 of PML III coding sequence) by a short unrelated 18-bp sequence, which includes a NotI site. The PMLΔCC sequence was generated by PCR amplification of 5′- and 3′-overlapping fragments, which both include the NotI site from the 18-bp sequence; the 5′-PCR fragment includes the initiator ATG of PML III and an upstream BamHI cloning site and the 3′-PCR fragment includes the PML III Stop codon and a downstream XhoI cloning site. The 5′ and 3′ PCR fragments (BamHI-NotI and NotI-XhoI fragments, respectively) were ligated together in a three-piece ligation reaction in the BamHI/XhoI site of pcDNA3.1(+) (primers used: “PML_BamHI_ATG sense” and “PML_ΔCC1_NotI antisense” for the 5′-fragment and “PML_ΔCC2_NotI sense” and “PML_ Stop_XhoI antisense” for the 3′-fragment). PMLWT and mutants were amplified by PCR from pBluescript SK+ for subcloning in appropriate vectors.

The following antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-PML (clone PGM3) (used for immunofluorescence microscopy), rabbit polyclonal anti-PML (clone H-238) (used for the Western), rabbit polyclonal anti-actin (clone C-11) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (clone M2) from Sigma. As2O3 (Sigma number A1010, 330 mm solution stock resuspended in 1 n NaOH) and Epoxomycin (Sigma number E3652, 100 μm solution stock resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide) were used at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the text. A stable expression of PML constructs was obtained by a lentiviral-based strategy as described (23Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the HIV-1-based lentiviral pTRIP vector, in which PML constructs are subcloned, relies on the presence of a triple-stranded DNA structure that acts as a cis-determinant of HIV-1 DNA import. The stable integration of the transgenes into the host DNA allows efficient and long term transgene expression without clone selection. Virus stock production and infection were as described in Ref. 23Zennou V. Petit C. Guetard D. Nerhbass U. Montagnier L. Charneau P. Cell. 2000; 101: 173-185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar to transduce and express PML wild type and mutants in the HEK293T cell line. Briefly, virus particles were produced after transient co-transfection of HEK293T cells, with the p8.91 encapsidation plasmid, the pHCMV-G vector encoding the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope and the pTRIP vector encoding PMLWT and its mutants, using a standard calcium phosphate method. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with GLUTAmax (Invitrogen), 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all from Invitrogen). Cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well dishes, 24 h before transfection. Transient transfections were performed using polyethylenimine (PEI, linear, Mr 25,000; catalog number 23966 Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen). PEI powder was dissolved in water to a concentration of 1 mg/ml in water that was heated to 80 °C. Usually, 0.1 μg of the PML-Luc construct was transfected alone or with increasing quantities of YFP-tagged SUMO1. The amount of transfected DNA was completed to a total of 2 μg with pcDNA3.1(+) empty vector. PEI (10 μg in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium) was added on the DNA and the samples were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The PEI-DNA suspension was then added to the attached cells in 2 ml of fresh culture media. Following an overnight incubation, transfection medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 3 h to allow cell recovery. Transfected cells (8 × 104) were then detached and replated in 96-well white plates with clear bottoms (Costar) pre-treated with d-polylysine (Sigma) and left in culture for 24 h before being processed for BRET1 assay. When required, the plated cells were treated with As2O3 for the appropriate time within this 24 h. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1 mml-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent), and 100 μg/ml penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/100-mm dish, 24 h before transfection. Transient transfections of plasmids were performed using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Usually, 1 μg of the PML-Luc construct was transfected alone or with increasing quantities of GFP-tagged SUMO1. The amount of transfected DNA was completed to a total of 10 μg with pGEM empty vector as described in Ref. 13Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22367-22373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. The transfection medium was replaced with the supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium after 26 h and cells were left in culture for an additional 22 h before being processed for BRET2 assay. When required, As2O3 treatment was done on the cells in suspension (see BRET2 detection assay). BRET1 measurement was done on attached cells as previously described (21Percherancier Y. Berchiche Y.A.

Before measurement, culture media was replaced by PBS. Coelenterazine H (Nanolight Technology) was then added to a final concentration of 5 μm in PBS. Readings were then collected using a multidetector plate reader MITHRAS LB940 (Berthold) allowing the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 480 ± 20 and 530 ± 20 nm windows, for luciferase and YFP light emissions, respectively. The BRET1 signal was determined by calculating the ratio of the light intensity emitted by the YFP fusion over the light intensity emitted by the Luc fusion. The values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET1 signal detected when the Luc fusion construct was expressed alone. For BRET1 titration experiments, BRET1 ratios were expressed as a function of the [acceptor]/[donor] expression ratio (YFP/Luc). Total fluorescence and luminescence were used as a relative measure of total expression of the acceptor and donor proteins, respectively. Total fluorescence was determined with MITHRAS using an excitation filter at 485 nm and an emission filter at 535 nm. Total luminescence was measured in the MITHRAS, 10 min after the addition of coelenterazine H and the reading was taken in the absence of emission filter. The BRET2 assays were conducted on cells in suspension as previously described in Ref. 13Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22367-22373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar. In brief, transiently transfected cells were resuspended in PBS. Cells were then distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from Packard) (20 μg corresponding to ∼1–2 × 105 cells). When required, cells were treated with 10 μm As2O3 or vehicle for the appropriate time at 37 °C. For the BRET2 assay, upon addition of the cell permeant luciferase substrate (coelenterazine Deep Blue, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), the bioluminescence signal resulting from the degradation of the substrate was detected using a 370–450-nm band pass filter (donor emission peak 400 nm). The transferred energy resulted in a fluorescence signal emitted by the GFP acceptor (excitation peak 400 nm and emission peak 510 nm) that was detected using a 500–530-nm band pass filter. The BRET2 signal was quantified by calculating the acceptor fluorescence/donor bioluminescence ratio as previously reported. Expression level of each construct was determined by direct measurements of total fluorescence and luminescence on aliquots of transfected cell samples. The GFP total fluorescence was measured using a FluoroCount (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with an excitation filter at 400 nm and an emission filter at 510 nm. The total luminescence was measured using the same cells incubated with coelenterazine H for 10 min (Molecular Probes) (emission peak 485 nm). The BRET2 was plotted as a function of the GFP/Luc fusion protein expression ratio, both fusion protein expressions being assessed with the same cells as described above, to take into account the potential variations in the expression of individual constructs from transfection to transfection. The values were corrected by subtracting the background BRET2 signal detected when the Luc fusion construct was expressed alone. All BRET1 and BRET2 results presented are derived from two to 10 independent experiments done in duplicate. For confocal microscopy, 3 × 105 HEK293T cells were seeded 24 h after their transfection onto glass coverslips pre-treated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) placed within 6-well plates. Cells were then washed three times in PBS 24 h later and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Following several washes, cells were permeabilized with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 2% bovine serum albumin (w/v)). Monoclonal anti-PML (1/250) and anti-RNF4 (1/100) antibodies were then added for 2 h in blocking buffer. Cells were washed twice and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 488- or 594-conjugated secondary antibody (1/500 dilution, Molecular Probes, Inc.). Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratory). Confocal images were obtained on a Leica TCS-NT/SP inverted confocal laser-scanning microscope using an Apochromat ×63/1.32 oil-immersion objective. Co-localization was performed by overlay of the images using Leica Confocal Software LCS (Heidelberg, Germany). Excitation and emission filters for the different labeled dyes were as follows: YFP (green): λex = 488 nm, λem = 540/25 nm; Texas Red (red): λex = 568 nm, λem = 610/30 nm. For total cell extracts, cells were washed in cold PBS, lysed in hot Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 10 min. Proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Optitran BA-S 83 NC, Schleicher and Schuell). The membranes were blocked in 5% gelatin from cold water fish (Sigma) for 2 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with the first antibody (H-238 anti-PML, anti-FLAG, or anti-actin). Following washes, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 680-coupled secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) that was then revealed by an Odyssey® Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). To better understand the role of SUMO in PML function and its involvement in the dynamic of PML NB formation, we developed a BRET assay for the detection of PML interactions with SUMO in living cells. For this purpose, PMLIII was tagged at its carboxyl terminus with a luciferase (PMLWT-Luc), whereas SUMO1 was tagged at its amino terminus with YFP or its GFP green variant. We performed a classic BRET titration assay (13Germain-Desprez D. Bazinet M. Bouvier M. Aubry M. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2057358642,"The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) functions primarily as an IRES trans-acting factor in the propagation of hepatitis C virus and picornaviruses. PTB interacts with secondary structures within the 3'- and 5'-untranslated regions of these viral genomes to mediate efficient IRES-mediated viral translation. PTB has also been reported to bind to the untranslated region of the single-stranded RNA dengue virus (DENV), suggesting a similar function for PTB in flaviviruses. Indeed small interfering RNA-mediated PTB knockdown inhibited the production of infectious DENV, and this inhibition was specific to PTB knockdown and not due to a nonspecific anti-viral state. In fact, PTB depletion did not inhibit the production infectious yellow fever virus, another flavivirus. Nevertheless, whereas PTB knockdown led to a significant decrease in the accumulation of DENV viral RNAs, it did not impair translation. Moreover, PTB was shown to interact with the DENV nonstructural 4A protein, a known component of the viral replication complex, and with the DENV genome during infection. These data suggest that PTB interacts with the replication complex of DENV and is acting at the level of viral RNA replication."

Septin 11 is expressed throughout the brain, being particularly high in the spiny branchlets of the Purkinje cells in the molecular layer of cerebellum and in the olfactory bulb. Immunofluorescence of cultured hippocampal neurons showed that 54 ± 4% of the GABAergic synapses and 25 ± 2% of the glutamatergic synapses had colocalizing septin 11 clusters. Similar colocalization numbers were found in the molecular layer of cerebellar sections. In cultured hippocampal neurons, septin 11 clusters were frequently present at the base of dendritic protrusions and at the bifurcation points of the dendritic branches. Electron microscopy immunocytochemistry of the rat brain cerebellum revealed the accumulation of septin 11 at the neck of dendritic spines, at the bifurcation of dendritic branches, and at some GABAergic synapses. Knocking down septin 11 in cultured hippocampal neurons with septin 11 small hairpin RNAs showed (i) reduced dendritic arborization; (ii) decreased density and increased length of dendritic protrusions; and (iii) decreased GABAergic synaptic contacts that these neurons receive. The results indicate that septin 11 plays important roles in the cytoarchitecture of neurons, including dendritic arborization and dendritic spines, and that septin 11 also plays a role in GABAergic synaptic connectivity.

Septins are a family of proteins with GTPase activity that form heterooligomeric filaments and ringlike structures that act as diffusion barriers and scaffolds. Septins are involved in cytokinesis, positioning of the mitotic spindle, cellular morphology, vesicle trafficking, apoptosis, neurodegeneration, and neoplasia (2Kinoshita M. J.

Nevertheless, the regional and developmental distribution of septin 11 in the brain and in hippocampal cultures is not identical to that of septin 7 or septin 5 (8Tada T. Simonetta A. Batterton M. Kinoshita M. Edbauer D. Sheng M. Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1752-1758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). These results and other heterooligomerization studies show that septin 11 is not always associated with septin 7 and septin 5 (7Fujishima K. Kiyonari H. Kurisu J. Hirano T. Kengaku M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 77-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 15Hanai N. Nagata K. Kawajiri A. Shiromizu T. Saitoh N. Hasegawa Y. Murakami S. Inagaki M.

Thus, septin 11 is expected to have functional properties both similar to and different from those of septin 7 and other septins that heterooligomerize with septin 11. In the present paper, we show that septin 11 is associated with the GABAergic synapses, particularly with the postsynapse, and concentrates at the neck of dendritic spines in the intact brain. Others have recently shown that another septin (septin 7) accumulates at the base of dendritic protrusions of cultured neurons (8Tada T. Simonetta A. Batterton M. Kinoshita M. Edbauer D. Sheng M.

However, it is not known whether septins also accumulate at the base of the dendritic spines in the brain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that (i) a septin has been shown to be associated with GABAergic synapses and (ii) a septin has been shown to concentrate at the neck of dendritic spines and dendritic branching points in the intact brain. All of the animal protocols have been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of the University of Connecticut and followed the National Institutes of Health guidelines. A novel rabbit antiserum (Rb anti-septin 11-N) was raised to the N-terminal synthetic peptide amino acids 1–14 of rat septin 11 (MAVAVGRPSNEELR; Fig. 1) that was covalently coupled, via an added C-terminal cysteine, to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce). The antibody was affinity-purified on immobilized synthetic peptide, and the specificity was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoblotting, immunofluorescence of transfected HEK 293 cells, brain immunocytochemistry, and displacement by the antigenic peptide. Another Rb anti-septin 11 antibody to amino acids 366–429 of the porcine septin 11 (Rb anti-septin 11–366) was affinity-purified on the immobilized fusion protein as described elsewhere (15Hanai N.

Two shRNAs (sh1 and sh2) targeting the coding sequence of the rat septin 11 were subcloned into mU6pro vector, respectively. The antisense strand of each shRNA perfectly matched the target mRNA, whereas the sense strand included a mismatch near the middle of the sequence (supplemental Fig. 3A). A DNA oligonucleotide encoding both arms of the shRNA was annealed with the corresponding reverse DNA strand, and the double-stranded DNA was ligated between the BbsI and XbaI sites of mU6pro vector (30Yu J.Y.

(32Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 86: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). The one-Triton PSD fraction (20Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was prepared from purified synaptosomes, as described elsewhere (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). For the preparation of type-I and type-II PSD fractions, the one-Triton PSD pellet was suspended in 0.32 m sucrose and loaded onto a continuous sucrose gradient 0.32–2.0 m in 1 mm NaHCO3, centrifuged at 201,800 × g for 16 h, and fractionated in 1-ml fractions, as described elsewhere (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Sucrose fraction number 6 (ρ = 1.10 g/ml) is enriched in GABAergic type-II PSDs, whereas sucrose number 10 (ρ = 1.20 g/ml) is enriched in glutamatergic type-I PSDs (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). All steps were carried out at 4 °C, and all fractions were suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Immunoblots for were done according to De Blas and Cherwinski (33De Blas A.L. Cherwinski H.M. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 133: 214-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and for supplemental Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 3, the chemiluminiscent protein bands were visualized with a Chemi Doc (Bio-Rad), and the intensities of the bands were quantified by Quantity One (Bio-Rad). The type-II PSD and type-I PSD fractions were loaded on SDS-PAGE in parallel and stained with Coomassie Blue. The main protein band, enriched in the type-II PSD over the type-I PSD fraction, was collected, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) at the Yale University Cancer Center Mass Spectrometry Resource and W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (New Haven, CT). A Waters Q-Tof mass spectrometer (Waters, Milford, MA) was used. The MS/MS fragmentation spectra were analyzed by Mascot Distiller, and proteins were identified by searching a Mascot data base. Hippocampal cultures were prepared according to Goslin et al. (34Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Culturing Nerve Cell. 2nd Ed. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998Google Scholar), as described elsewhere (22Christie S.B. Li R.W. Miralles C.P. Riquelme R. Yang B.Y.

Cultured high density hippocampal neurons (10 DIV), HEK 293 cells, or rat neuroblastoma B103 cells were transfected with 2 μg total of various plasmids for protein or shRNA expression using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (BD Biosciences), following the instructions of the manufacturer. Four days later, after transfection (14 DIV for neurons), cells were subjected to immunofluorescence, as described above. Quantification of the effect of shRNAs on the expression of septin 11 was done after nucleofection of rat neuroblastoma B103 cells using the Cell Line Nucleofector Kit L (Amaxa GmbH, Koln, Germany), following the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Fluorescence images of neuronal cultures were collected using a ×60 panfluor objective on a Nikon Eclipse T300 microscope with a Sensys KAF 1401E CCD camera, driven by IPLab version 4.0 (Scanalytics, Rockville, MD) acquisition software. Brain section immunofluorescence images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP2 laser confocal microscope using a HCXPL Apo ×100 oil CS objective lens and a pinhole set at 1 Airy unit. For qualitative analysis, images were processed with Photoshop version 7.0 (Adobe, San Jose, CA), as described elsewhere (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J.

For determining the density of γ2 clusters, septin 11 clusters, and dendritic protrusion and the length of the latter, 30 dendrites were randomly selected from 15–20 cells from 3–4 separate experiments. The maximum intensities of the fluorophore channel were normalized, and the low intensity and diffuse nonclustered background fluorescence signal seen in the dendrites was subtracted. The density of clusters or dendritic protrusions was calculated as the number of clusters or dendritic protrusions/100 μm2. Cluster colocalization in two different fluorescence channels was determined by overlaying the images. A cluster in a fluorescence channel was considered to colocalize with a cluster (or dendritic protrusion) in the other channel when >66% of the surface of one of the clusters overlapped with the other cluster (or dendritic protrusion). The length of the dendritic protrusions was determined after manual tracing followed by measurement by IPLab version 4.0 (Scanalytics). The total number of clusters, spines, or puncta counted per transfection condition (mean ± S.E.) was 461 ± 15 for septin 11, 535 ± 63 for γ2-GABAAR, 623 ± 43 for spine density, 989 ± 52 for spine length, and 821 ± 54 for PSD-95 and 845 ± 48 for vGut1. For quantifying the GABAergic innervation, 25 pairs of transfected neurons and their corresponding nontransfected sister neighbor neurons from 3–4 experiments were selected, and the number of GAD+ boutons was counted. The total number of GAD boutons counted per transfection condition was 732 ± 71 in transfected cells and 867 ± 74 in nontransfected cells. For Sholl analysis (38Sholl D.A. J. Anat. 1953; 87: 387-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the images of 30 transfected neurons from three experiments were taken with a ×40 objective, and the dendrites of the transfected neuron were visualized by EGFP or mCherry fluorescence. Concentric circles with 10-μm differences in radius were drawn around the cell body, and the number of dendrites crossing each circle was manually counted.

All sections were visualized with a Tecnai Biotwin 12KV transmission electron microscope (FEI Corp., Eindhoven, Holland). There is limited knowledge about the molecular components and organization of the GABAergic type-II PSDs compared with that of the glutamatergic type-I PSDs, in part because until recently (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), there was no method for the isolation from the rat brain of subcellular fractions enriched in type-II PSDs. We have recently shown that the classical one-Triton PSD fraction (made of the insoluble material after Triton X-100 extraction of the brain synaptosomal fraction) (20Walikonis R.S. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Provance Jr., D.W. Mercer J.A. Kennedy M.B. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4069-4080Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Carlin R.K. Grab D.J. Cohen R.S. Siekevitz P. J.

Cell Biol. 1974; 63: 441-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) contains PSDs from both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses, which can be separated by centrifugation in a continuous sucrose gradient (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The GABAergic type-II PSDs, which are enriched in GABAARs and gephyrin, have lower density than the glutamatergic type-I PSDs, which are enriched in the postsynaptic marker PSD-95 protein (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In an effort to identify other proteins present in the GABAergic type-II PSDs, we did a comparative analysis by SDS-PAGE of the major protein components in the fractions enriched in type-II and type-I PSDs. The type-II PSD fraction showed a prominent protein band (∼50 kDa) that was not obviously present in the type-I PSD fraction (Fig. 1A, arrow). The LC-MS/MS analysis of the tryptic peptides of this protein band identified septin 11 as the major component with 14 peptide matches. Immunoblotting with the Rb anti-septin 11-N and Rb anti-septin 11–366 confirmed the enrichment in the 50-kDa septin 11 in the type-II PSD fraction over the type-I PSD fraction (Fig. 1B, filled arrows). Septin 11 was also present in the one-Triton PSD, from which type-I and type-II PSD fractions were derived. The type-II PSD fraction was also enriched in gephyrin (93 kDa) over the type-I PSD fraction (4.1-fold), whereas the type-I PSD was enriched in PSD-95 (95 kDa) over the type-II PSD fraction (6.2-fold), as shown in Fig. 1B (empty arrow and filled arrowhead, respectively). We have shown elsewhere that the type-II PSD fraction is also enriched in GABAARs, containing the γ2 subunit (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Thus, although the type-II PSD fraction is enriched in GABAergic postsynaptic markers, it contains some type-I PSDs. In turn, the type-I PSD preparation contains some type-II PSDs, as we have discussed elsewhere (1Li X. Serwanski D.R. Miralles C.P. Bahr B.A. De Blas A.L. J. Neurochem. 2007; 102: 1329-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, septin 11 is significantly enriched in the type-II PSD fraction over the type-I PSD fraction (7-fold, as shown in Fig. 1B (arrows)). Four mRNA splice variants of septin 11 (transcripts I–IV) were cloned from an adult rat brain Marathon-ready cDNA library. The four variants differ in (i) the presence or absence of nucleotides encoding the 6 or 7 amino acids of the C terminus (Fig. 1C) and (ii) the 3′-UTRs. Sequence comparison of these isoforms to the rat genome revealed that the septin 11 ge"
https://openalex.org/W2006760543,"Background Malaria triggers a high inflammatory response in the host that mediates most of the associated pathologies and contributes to death. The identification of pro-inflammatory molecules derived from Plasmodium is essential to understand the mechanisms of pathogenesis and to develop targeted interventions. Uric acid derived from hypoxanthine accumulated in infected erythrocytes has been recently proposed as a mediator of inflammation in rodent malaria. Methods and Findings We found that human erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum gradually accumulate hypoxanthine in their late stages of development. To analyze the role of hypoxanthine-derived uric acid induced by P. falciparum on the inflammatory cytokine response from human blood mononuclear cells, cultures were treated with allopurinol, to inhibit uric acid formation from hypoxanthine, or with uricase, to degrade uric acid. Both treatments significantly reduce the secretion of TNF, IL-6, IL-1β and IL-10 from human cells. Conclusions and Significance Uric acid is a major contributor of the inflammatory response triggered by P. falciparum in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Since the inflammatory reaction induced by P. falciparum is considered a major cause of malaria pathogenesis, identifying the mechanisms used by the parasite to induce the host inflammatory response is essential to develop urgently needed therapies against this disease."

After coat assembly and membrane invagination, which is facilitated by BAR domain-containing proteins, vesicle fission is catalyzed by the recruitment and helical assembly of the GTPase dynamin at the neck of the burgeoning vesicle. Membrane scission requires the cooperative activity of dynamin with SH3 domain-containing proteins, many of which possess BAR domains and regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is required for endocytosis in yeast and may have a regulatory role in mammalian cells. The actin-associated motor proteins myosin 1E and myosin VI are linked to the endocytic machinery via dynamin or synaptojanin and Dab2, respectively. During vesicle uncoating, primary endocytic vesicles may acquire Rab5, a small GTPase involved in transport to early endosomes and in early endosome docking and fusion. Primary endocytic vesicles are targeted to and fuse with early endosomes expressing phosphatidylinositol(3)-phosphate, PI(3)P, in a process dependent on Rab5 effector proteins and early endosomal SNAREs. Differential sorting of cargo destined for recycling (requiring Rab11 and possibly Rab4) or for late endosome/lysosomal degradation (requiring Rab7) can occur at the level of clathrin-coated pits and be com-pleted in early endosomal subdomains. Transport of cargo from early endosomes to the trans-Golgi network requires the retromer protein complex."
https://openalex.org/W2088903662,"Studies have attributed several functions to the Eaf family, including tumor suppression and eye development. Given the potential association between cancer and development, we set forth to explore Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 activity in vertebrate embryogenesis, using zebrafish. In situ hybridization revealed similar eaf1 and eaf2/u19 expression patterns. Morpholino-mediated knockdown of either eaf1 or eaf2/u19 expression produced similar morphological changes that could be reversed by ectopic expression of target or reciprocal-target mRNA. However, combination of Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 (Eafs)-morpholinos increased the severity of defects, suggesting that Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 only share some functional redundancy. The Eafs knockdown phenotype resembled that of embryos with defects in convergence and extension movements. Indeed, knockdown caused expression pattern changes for convergence and extension movement markers, whereas cell tracing experiments using kaeda mRNA showed a correlation between Eafs knockdown and cell migration defects. Cardiac and pancreatic differentiation markers revealed that Eafs knockdown also disrupted midline convergence of heart and pancreatic organ precursors. Noncanonical Wnt signaling plays a key role in both convergence and extension movements and midline convergence of organ precursors. We found that Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 maintained expression levels of wnt11 and wnt5. Moreover, wnt11 or wnt5 mRNA partially rescued the convergence and extension movement defects occurring in eafs morphants. Wnt11 and Wnt5 converge on rhoA, so not surprisingly, rhoA mRNA more effectively rescued defects than either wnt11 or wnt5 mRNA alone. However, the ectopic expression of wnt11 and wnt5 did not affect eaf1 and eaf2/u19 expression.

EAF1 (ELL-associated factor 1) was first discovered through its ability to associate with the protein ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia), a fusion partner of MLL in the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) chromosomal translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (1Thirman M.J.

Subsequent studies found a second binding partner for ELL, EAF2, which was independently identified as an androgen up-regulated gene in the rat prostate and named human up-regulated 19 (U19) (3Wang Z.

Blood. 2003; 101: 2355-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ELL binds to RNA polymerase II and acts as a transcriptional elongation factor whose targeted deletion leads to embryonic lethality in mice (5Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C.

Simone F. Polak P.E. Kawamata S. Thirman M.J. Mol. Cell.

Zhang Q. Jiang F. Pins M. Kozlowski J.M. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4698-4704PubMed Google Scholar). These findings link the EAF2/U19 gene with two major human cancers: prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. To investigate the function EAF2/U19 in vivo, we constructed a murine knock-out model. The EAF2/U19 knock-out mice develop B-cell lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia with high frequency (10Xiao W. Zhang Q. Habermacher G.

In addition, we demonstrated that EAF2/U19 could bind to and stabilize the classic tumor suppressor-pVHL (11Xiao W. Ai J. Habermacher G. Volpert O. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Hahn J. Cai X. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings further support EAF2/U19 as a potential tumor suppressor; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity remain poorly defined.Evidence suggests that oncogenes and tumor suppressors may play a role in normal vertebrate embryogenesis. Thus, the evaluation of how these proteins function during embryogenesis would not only lead to a better understanding of development but may also shed light on how these proteins contribute to tumor initiation and progression (12Lee H. Kimelman D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Langheinrich U. Hennen E. Stott G. Vacun G. Curr.

Several studies have shown that eaf2/u19 appears to be important during embryogenesis, particularly in eye development (14Li M. Wu X. Zhuang F. Jiang S. Jiang M. Liu Y.H. Dev.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but its function in vertebrate embryogenesis remains unclear.In vertebrates, the body plan is established during gastrulation by a set of morphogenetic processes, including epiboly, internalization, and convergence and extension movements (16Myers D.C. Sepich D.S. Solnica-Krezel L. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Gastrulation starts with the epiboly of the enveloping layer and deep cells and the internalization of prospective mesendodermal cells, followed by convergence and extension movements. convergence and extension movements narrow embryonic tissues mediolaterally and lengthen them anteroposteriorly (17Keller R. Shih J. Domingo C. Dev. Suppl. 1992; : 81-91PubMed Google Scholar). By convergence movements, the precursor cells of many organs migrate toward midline from bilateral tissues and assemble to form the primitive organs (18Stainier D.Y. Nat.

EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). During the convergence and extension movements, multiple signaling cascades control coordinated cell behaviors. silberblick/wnt11 (slb) and pipetail/wnt5 (ppt) zebrafish mutants show abnormal convergence and extension movements and display a short tail and body axis (20Heisenberg C.P.

Thus, the noncanonical Wnt cascade has been proposed to be essential for convergence and extension movements. In addition, rhoA has been reported to act downstream of wnt5 and wnt11 to regulate convergence and extension movements (22Zhu S. Liu L. Korzh V. Gong Z. Low B.C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).We employed the zebrafish embryo as a model system to investigate the role of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 in vertebrate development. Based on initial findings, we focused our examination on the regulation of convergence and extension movements and midline convergence of the heart and pancreas primordia by Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 during zebrafish embryogenesis. We also examined whether eaf1 and eaf2/u19 regulate convergence and extension movements by noncanonical Wnt signaling.DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have established that EAF2/U19 contributes to tumor suppression (9Xiao W. Zhang Q. Jiang F. Pins M. Kozlowski J.M. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4698-4704PubMed Google Scholar, 10Xiao W. Zhang Q. Habermacher G. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Cai X. Hahn J. Liu J. Pins M. Doglio L. Dhir R. Gingrich J. Wang Z. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that EAF1 and EAF2/U19, like other tumor suppressors, may play a role in vertebrate development (14Li M. Wu X. Zhuang F. Jiang S. Jiang M. Liu Y.H. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Maurus D. Héligon C. Bürger-Schwärzler A. Brändli A.W. Kühl M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, their exact function in embryogenesis remains unclear. To better understand the cellular function of EAF1 and EAF2/U19 and subsequently how these proteins suppress tumors will require a more extensive investigation of their roles in embryogenesis. Here, we are the first to present data showing that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mediate effective convergence and extension movements through the maintenance of wnt11 and wnt5 expression during zebrafish gastrulation.Eaf family members demonstrated a high degree of conservation across species and with each other, so not surprisingly, the expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 observed in the zebrafish mirrored the pattern seen in the mouse (14Li M. Wu X. Zhuang F. Jiang S. Jiang M. Liu Y.H. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, intercrosses of EAF2/U19 heterozygous knock-out mice yielded Eaf2/U19-null offspring at Mendelian ratios at birth, suggesting that early mouse development did not require EAF2/U19 (10Xiao W. Zhang Q. Habermacher G. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Cai X. Hahn J. Liu J. Pins M. Doglio L. Dhir R. Gingrich J. Wang Z. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Eaf2/U19 knockdown in zebrafish embryos alone caused defects in convergence and extension movements in our study. This phenotypic difference between mouse and zebrafish might result from either the redundant function of EAF1 and EAF2/U19 in mouse embryogenesis or from slightly different functions of EAF2/U19 in mammalians and lower vertebrate fish. Indeed, functional differences between mammalian and fish genes are not uncommon (36Correa R.G. Matsui T. Tergaonkar V. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1291-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, Eaf2/U19 knockdown in Xenopus laevis caused defects in eye development, which was a pure eye phenotype unrelated to the defect of convergence and extension movement (15Maurus D. Héligon C. Bürger-Schwärzler A. Brändli A.W. Kühl M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, eaf2/u19 knockdown in zebrafish caused shorter eye distance or eye fusion (partial cyclopia) resulting from the defect in convergence and extension movements (Fig. 8C). Together, eaf1 and eaf2/u19 might play different roles in eye development during embryogenesis. Further demonstrating the different mechanism of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 playing their roles in eye formation among species probably will give us a more complete picture about the function of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 in embryogenesis.eaf1 and eaf2/u19 appeared to play partially redundant roles in the regulation of convergence and extension movements. Knockdown of both eaf1 and eaf2/u19 resulted in abnormal cell behavior in both the head and trunk mesendoderm (Fig. 2). The phenotypes observed in eafs morphants included disorganized head structure, reduced body axis, and shorter tail and were similar to those seen in embryos with a disruption of convergence and extension movements (20Heisenberg C.P.

Solnica-Krezel L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 610-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). On the basis of phenotype, the marker gene expression patterns, and cell tracing experiments, we concluded that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 served as novel regulators of convergence and extension movements (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). In reciprocal rescue experiments, eaf1 mRNA could rescue Eaf2-MO1 knockdowns, and eaf2/u19 mRNA could rescue Eaf1-MO knockdowns, suggesting redundant roles for Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 in the regulation of convergence and extension movements. However, knockdown of either eaf1 or eaf2/u19 produced similar defects that increased in severity with the combined knockdown of both Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), indicating that these proteins do not have completely redundant functions.In this study, we found that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 might contribute to the regulation of convergence and extension movements through noncanonical Wnt signaling. Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 knockdown dramatically down-regulated wnt11 expression, whereas introduction of ectopic eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mRNA increased wnt11 expression (Fig. 7). Moreover, wnt11 mRNA rescued convergence and extension movement defects caused by Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 knockdown with high frequency (Fig. 9A). However, overexpression of wnt11 by mRNA injection did not affect the expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 (Fig. 8). These findings imply that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 act upstream of wnt11 to control its expression and to govern convergence and extension movements. Furthermore, Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 knockdown down-regulated wnt5 expression (Fig. 7, A and C), and wnt5 mRNA, in turn, also rescued defects in convergence and extension movements caused by the loss of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 (Fig. 9A (A4)). However, overexpression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 also down-regulated wnt5 expression, with expression levels comparable with those seen in the eafs morphants (Fig. 7, E and G). This suggests that the maintenance of wnt5 might require a specific level or ratio of eaf1 and eaf2/u19. Similar to that of wnt11, wnt5 overexpression did not affect the expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19, suggesting that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 also act upstream of wnt5. As a downstream activator of noncanonical Wnt ligands, RhoA rescued convergence and extension movement defect more effectively than Wnt5 and Wnt11 (Fig. 8), indicating a convergence of wnt5 and wnt11 on rhoA during the regulation of convergence and extension movements. Of note, the expression patterns of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 were similar to that of rhoA during zebrafish and Xenopus embryogenesis (22Zhu S. Liu L. Korzh V. Gong Z. Low B.C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Wünnenberg-Stapleton K. Blitz I.L. Hashimoto C. Cho K.W. Development. 1999; 126: 5339-5351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Notably, eaf1 and eaf2/u19 have activity in stimulating ELL transcriptional elongation (7Kong S.E. Banks C.A. Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, if knockdown of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 only caused inhibition of gene expression, eafs regulating the expression of Wnts (wnt11, wnt5, and wnt11r) presented in this study might be nonspecific as a result of disrupting the general function of eafs as regulators of transcriptional elongation. However, in addition to wnt4a,4 foxo5 (Fig. 9A) as well as other genes5 were up-regulated by eafs knockdown, unrelated to their function as regulators of transcriptional elongation. Therefore, eafs knockdown inhibiting the expression of Wnts appears to be specific. Taking into consideration that the knockdown of eafs did not affect cell fate specification at the beginning of gastrulation, it suggests that eafs might directly regulate noncanonical Wnt ligands (especially for wnt11). However, this conclusion needs to be further verified by more direct ways, such as promoter chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, etc.Knockdown of Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 protein levels also resulted in the failure of fusion of the heart and pancreas primordia (Fig. 6), but neither endoderm fate determination genes nor myocardial precursor marker genes displayed significant changes in their expression levels (Fig. 6, F–H). These observations imply that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 act as novel regulators of midline convergence of both endoderm- and mesoderm-derived organ primordia without affecting the specification of progenitors.Although a primary role of non-canonical Wnt signaling was to govern convergence and extension movements, studies had also shown that the three Wnt noncanonical ligands, wnt4a, wnt11, and wnt11r, redundantly regulated midline convergence of organ primordia, in zebrafish embryos (31Matsui T. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Callol-Massot C. Capdevila J. Rodríguez-Esteban C. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Miyasaka K.Y. Kida Y.S. Sato T. Minami M. Ogura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11274-11279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the midline migration of heart precursors and pancreas precursors required expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 (Fig. 6). We also showed that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mediated midline convergence through noncanonical Wnt signaling, specifically by regulating expression of wnt11 and wnt11r (). Unexpectedly, however, knockdown of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 up-regulated wnt4a expression.4 This observation suggested that, unlike wnt11 and wntllr, wnt4a was not a downstream factor of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 in the signaling pathway that regulated midline convergence of organ precursors.In conclusion, our data are the first to demonstrate that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 have essential roles in regulating embryonic cell behavior and migration. Although the complete pathway has yet to be defined, our study shows that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 function in this pathway by specifically modulating expression of wnt11 and wnt5, which in turn converge on rhoA for the positive regulation of convergence and extension movements. EAF1 (ELL-associated factor 1) was first discovered through its ability to associate with the protein ELL (eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukemia), a fusion partner of MLL in the t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) chromosomal translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia (1Thirman M.J.

Levitan D.A. Thirman M.J. Blood. 2001; 98: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found a second binding partner for ELL, EAF2, which was independently identified as an androgen up-regulated gene in the rat prostate and named human up-regulated 19 (U19) (3Wang Z. Tufts R. Haleem R. Cai X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12999-13004Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 4Simone F. Luo R.T. Polak P.E. Kaberlein J.J. Thirman M.J. Blood. 2003; 101: 2355-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). ELL binds to RNA polymerase II and acts as a transcriptional elongation factor whose targeted deletion leads to embryonic lethality in mice (5Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Mitani K. Yamagata T. Iida C. Oda H. Maki K. Ichikawa M. Asai T. Honda H. Kurokawa M. Hirai H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Both EAF1 and EAF2, which share significant sequence homology, stimulate ELL elongation activity (7Kong S.E. Banks C.A. Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Studies by Luo et al. (8Luo R.T. Lavau C. Du C. Simone F. Polak P.E. Kawamata S. Thirman M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5678-5687Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) argued that EAF proteins are important in MLL-ELL leukemogenesis, whereas our previous studies showed that EAF2/U19 inhibits xenograft prostate tumor growth and undergoes down-regulation in prostate cancer cell lines (9Xiao W. Zhang Q. Jiang F. Pins M. Kozlowski J.M. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4698-4704PubMed Google Scholar). These findings link the EAF2/U19 gene with two major human cancers: prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia. To investigate the function EAF2/U19 in vivo, we constructed a murine knock-out model. The EAF2/U19 knock-out mice develop B-cell lymphoma, lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and prostate intraepithelial neoplasia with high frequency (10Xiao W. Zhang Q. Habermacher G. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Cai X. Hahn J. Liu J. Pins M. Doglio L. Dhir R. Gingrich J. Wang Z. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, we demonstrated that EAF2/U19 could bind to and stabilize the classic tumor suppressor-pVHL (11Xiao W. Ai J. Habermacher G. Volpert O. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Hahn J. Cai X. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These findings further support EAF2/U19 as a potential tumor suppressor; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this activity remain poorly defined. Evidence suggests that oncogenes and tumor suppressors may play a role in normal vertebrate embryogenesis. Thus, the evaluation of how these proteins function during embryogenesis would not only lead to a better understanding of development but may also shed light on how these proteins contribute to tumor initiation and progression (12Lee H. Kimelman D. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 607-616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 13Langheinrich U. Hennen E. Stott G. Vacun G. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 2023-2028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that eaf2/u19 appears to be important during embryogenesis, particularly in eye development (14Li M. Wu X. Zhuang F. Jiang S. Jiang M. Liu Y.H. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Maurus D. Héligon C. Bürger-Schwärzler A. Brändli A.W. Kühl M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), but its function in vertebrate embryogenesis remains unclear. In vertebrates, the body plan is established during gastrulation by a set of morphogenetic processes, including epiboly, internalization, and convergence and extension movements (16Myers D.C. Sepich D.S. Solnica-Krezel L. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 447-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Gastrulation starts with the epiboly of the enveloping layer and deep cells and the internalization of prospective mesendodermal cells, followed by convergence and extension movements. convergence and extension movements narrow embryonic tissues mediolaterally and lengthen them anteroposteriorly (17Keller R. Shih J. Domingo C. Dev. Suppl. 1992; : 81-91PubMed Google Scholar). By convergence movements, the precursor cells of many organs migrate toward midline from bilateral tissues and assemble to form the primitive organs (18Stainier D.Y. Nat. Rev. 2001; 2: 39-48Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 19Ober E.A. Olofsson B. Mäkinen T. Jin S.W. Shoji W. Koh G.Y. Alitalo K. Stainier D.Y. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 78-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). During the convergence and extension movements, multiple signaling cascades control coordinated cell behaviors. silberblick/wnt11 (slb) and pipetail/wnt5 (ppt) zebrafish mutants show abnormal convergence and extension movements and display a short tail and body axis (20Heisenberg C.P. Tada M. Rauch G.J. Saúde L. Concha M.L. Geisler R. Stemple D.L. Smith J.C. Wilson S.W. Nature. 2000; 405: 76-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 21Kilian B. Mansukoski H. Barbosa F.C. Ulrich F. Tada M. Heisenberg C.P. Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 467-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Thus, the noncanonical Wnt cascade has been proposed to be essential for convergence and extension movements. In addition, rhoA has been reported to act downstream of wnt5 and wnt11 to regulate convergence and extension movements (22Zhu S. Liu L. Korzh V. Gong Z. Low B.C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We employed the zebrafish embryo as a model system to investigate the role of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 in vertebrate development.

However, in addition to wnt4a,4 foxo5 (Fig. 9A) as well as other genes5 were up-regulated by eafs knockdown, unrelated to their function as regulators of transcriptional elongation. Therefore, eafs knockdown inhibiting the expression of Wnts appears to be specific. Taking into consideration that the knockdown of eafs did not affect cell fate specification at the beginning of gastrulation, it suggests that eafs might directly regulate noncanonical Wnt ligands (especially for wnt11). However, this conclusion needs to be further verified by more direct ways, such as promoter chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, etc.Knockdown of Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 protein levels also resulted in the failure of fusion of the heart and pancreas primordia (Fig. 6), but neither endoderm fate determination genes nor myocardial precursor marker genes displayed significant changes in their expression levels (Fig. 6, F–H). These observations imply that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 act as novel regulators of midline convergence of both endoderm- and mesoderm-derived organ primordia without affecting the specification of progenitors.Although a primary role of non-canonical Wnt signaling was to govern convergence and extension movements, studies had also shown that the three Wnt noncanonical ligands, wnt4a, wnt11, and wnt11r, redundantly regulated midline convergence of organ primordia, in zebrafish embryos (31Matsui T. Raya A. Kawakami Y. Callol-Massot C. Capdevila J. Rodríguez-Esteban C. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 164-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 41Miyasaka K.Y. Kida Y.S. Sato T. Minami M. Ogura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11274-11279Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that the midline migration of heart precursors and pancreas precursors required expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 (Fig. 6). We also showed that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mediated midline convergence through noncanonical Wnt signaling, specifically by regulating expression of wnt11 and wnt11r (). Unexpectedly, however, knockdown of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 up-regulated wnt4a expression.4 This observation suggested that, unlike wnt11 and wntllr, wnt4a was not a downstream factor of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 in the signaling pathway that regulated midline convergence of organ precursors.In conclusion, our data are the first to demonstrate that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 have essential roles in regulating embryonic cell behavior and migration. Although the complete pathway has yet to be defined, our study shows that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 function in this pathway by specifically modulating expression of wnt11 and wnt5, which in turn converge on rhoA for the positive regulation of convergence and extension movements. Previous studies have established that EAF2/U19 contributes to tumor suppression (9Xiao W. Zhang Q. Jiang F. Pins M. Kozlowski J.M. Wang Z. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4698-4704PubMed Google Scholar, 10Xiao W. Zhang Q. Habermacher G. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Cai X. Hahn J. Liu J. Pins M. Doglio L. Dhir R. Gingrich J. Wang Z. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other studies suggest that EAF1 and EAF2/U19, like other tumor suppressors, may play a role in vertebrate development (14Li M. Wu X. Zhuang F. Jiang S. Jiang M. Liu Y.H. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Maurus D. Héligon C. Bürger-Schwärzler A. Brändli A.W. Kühl M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, their exact function in embryogenesis remains unclear. To better understand the cellular function of EAF1 and EAF2/U19 and subsequently how these proteins suppress tumors will require a more extensive investigation of their roles in embryogenesis. Here, we are the first to present data showing that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mediate effective convergence and extension movements through the maintenance of wnt11 and wnt5 expression during zebrafish gastrulation. Eaf family members demonstrated a high degree of conservation across species and with each other, so not surprisingly, the expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 observed in the zebrafish mirrored the pattern seen in the mouse (14Li M. Wu X. Zhuang F. Jiang S. Jiang M. Liu Y.H. Dev. Dyn. 2003; 228: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, intercrosses of EAF2/U19 heterozygous knock-out mice yielded Eaf2/U19-null offspring at Mendelian ratios at birth, suggesting that early mouse development did not require EAF2/U19 (10Xiao W. Zhang Q. Habermacher G. Yang X. Zhang A.Y. Cai X. Hahn J. Liu J. Pins M. Doglio L. Dhir R. Gingrich J. Wang Z. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 1536-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Eaf2/U19 knockdown in zebrafish embryos alone caused defects in convergence and extension movements in our study. This phenotypic difference between mouse and zebrafish might result from either the redundant function of EAF1 and EAF2/U19 in mouse embryogenesis or from slightly different functions of EAF2/U19 in mammalians and lower vertebrate fish. Indeed, functional differences between mammalian and fish genes are not uncommon (36Correa R.G. Matsui T. Tergaonkar V. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Izpisua-Belmonte J.C. Verma I.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1291-1295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, Eaf2/U19 knockdown in Xenopus laevis caused defects in eye development, which was a pure eye phenotype unrelated to the defect of convergence and extension movement (15Maurus D. Héligon C. Bürger-Schwärzler A. Brändli A.W. Kühl M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1181-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, eaf2/u19 knockdown in zebrafish caused shorter eye distance or eye fusion (partial cyclopia) resulting from the defect in convergence and extension movements (Fig. 8C). Together, eaf1 and eaf2/u19 might play different roles in eye development during embryogenesis. Further demonstrating the different mechanism of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 playing their roles in eye formation among species probably will give us a more complete picture about the function of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 in embryogenesis. eaf1 and eaf2/u19 appeared to play partially redundant roles in the regulation of convergence and extension movements. Knockdown of both eaf1 and eaf2/u19 resulted in abnormal cell behavior in both the head and trunk mesendoderm (Fig. 2). The phenotypes observed in eafs morphants included disorganized head structure, reduced body axis, and shorter tail and were similar to those seen in embryos with a disruption of convergence and extension movements (20Heisenberg C.P.

On the basis of phenotype, the marker gene expression patterns, and cell tracing experiments, we concluded that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 served as novel regulators of convergence and extension movements (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). In reciprocal rescue experiments, eaf1 mRNA could rescue Eaf2-MO1 knockdowns, and eaf2/u19 mRNA could rescue Eaf1-MO knockdowns, suggesting redundant roles for Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 in the regulation of convergence and extension movements. However, knockdown of either eaf1 or eaf2/u19 produced similar defects that increased in severity with the combined knockdown of both Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4), indicating that these proteins do not have completely redundant functions. In this study, we found that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 might contribute to the regulation of convergence and extension movements through noncanonical Wnt signaling. Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 knockdown dramatically down-regulated wnt11 expression, whereas introduction of ectopic eaf1 and eaf2/u19 mRNA increased wnt11 expression (Fig. 7). Moreover, wnt11 mRNA rescued convergence and extension movement defects caused by Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 knockdown with high frequency (Fig. 9A). However, overexpression of wnt11 by mRNA injection did not affect the expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 (Fig. 8). These findings imply that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 act upstream of wnt11 to control its expression and to govern convergence and extension movements. Furthermore, Eaf1 and Eaf2/U19 knockdown down-regulated wnt5 expression (Fig. 7, A and C), and wnt5 mRNA, in turn, also rescued defects in convergence and extension movements caused by the loss of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 (Fig. 9A (A4)). However, overexpression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 also down-regulated wnt5 expression, with expression levels comparable with those seen in the eafs morphants (Fig. 7, E and G). This suggests that the maintenance of wnt5 might require a specific level or ratio of eaf1 and eaf2/u19. Similar to that of wnt11, wnt5 overexpression did not affect the expression of eaf1 and eaf2/u19, suggesting that eaf1 and eaf2/u19 also act upstream of wnt5. As a downstream activator of noncanonical Wnt ligands, RhoA rescued convergence and extension movement defect more effectively than Wnt5 and Wnt11 (Fig. 8), indicating a convergence of wnt5 and wnt11 on rhoA during the regulation of convergence and extension movements. Of note, the expression patterns of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 were similar to that of rhoA during zebrafish and Xenopus embryogenesis (22Zhu S. Liu L. Korzh V. Gong Z. Low B.C. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 359-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Wünnenberg-Stapleton K. Blitz I.L. Hashimoto C. Cho K.W. Development. 1999; 126: 5339-5351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, eaf1 and eaf2/u19 have activity in stimulating ELL transcriptional elongation (7Kong S.E. Banks C.A. Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10094-10098Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, if knockdown of eaf1 and eaf2/u19 only caused inhibition of gene expression, eafs regulating the expression of Wnts (wnt11, wnt5, and wnt11r) presented in this study might be nonspecific as a result of disrupting the general function of eafs as regulators of transcriptional elongation.

https://openalex.org/W2017697138,"The Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2 (SV2) family of transporter-like proteins is expressed exclusively in vesicles that undergo calcium-regulated exocytosis. Of the three isoforms expressed in mammals, SV2B is the most divergent. Here we report studies of SV2B location and function in the retina. Immunolabeling studies revealed that SV2B is detected in rod photoreceptor synaptic terminals where it is the primary isoform. In mice lacking SV2B, synaptic transmission at the synapse between photoreceptors and bipolar neurons was decreased, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the amplitude of the b-wave in electroretinogram recordings. Quantitative immunoblot analyses of whole eyes revealed that loss of SV2B was associated with reduced levels of synaptic vesicle proteins including synaptotagmin, VAMP, synaptophysin and the vesicular glutamate transporter V-GLUT1. Immunolabeling studies revealed that SV2B is detected in rod photoreceptor synaptic terminals where it is the primary isoform. Thus, SV2B contributes to the modulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and plays a significant role in regulating synaptic protein content."
https://openalex.org/W2113046777,"Hypertonicity can perturb cellular functions, induce DNA damage-like responses and inhibit proliferation. The transcription factor NFAT5 induces osmoprotective gene products that allow cells to adapt to sustained hypertonic conditions. Although it is known that NFAT5-deficient lymphocytes and renal medullary cells have reduced proliferative capacity and viability under hypertonic stress, less is understood about the contribution of this factor to DNA damage responses and cell cycle regulation.We have generated conditional knockout mice to obtain NFAT5(-/-) T lymphocytes, which we used as a model of proliferating cells to study NFAT5-dependent responses. We show that hypertonicity triggered an early, NFAT5-independent, genotoxic stress-like response with induction of p53, p21 and GADD45, downregulation of cyclins, and cell cycle arrest. This was followed by an NFAT5-dependent adaptive phase in wild-type cells, which induced an osmoprotective gene expression program, downregulated stress markers, resumed cyclin expression and proliferation, and displayed enhanced NFAT5 transcriptional activity in S and G2/M. In contrast, NFAT5(-/-) cells failed to induce osmoprotective genes and exhibited poorer viability. Although surviving NFAT5(-/-) cells downregulated genotoxic stress markers, they underwent cell cycle arrest in G1/S and G2/M, which was associated with reduced expression of cyclins E1, A2 and B1. We also show that pathologic hypertonicity levels, as occurring in plasma of patients and animal models of osmoregulatory disorders, inhibited the induction of cyclins and aurora B kinase in response to T cell receptor stimulation in fresh NFAT5(-/-) lymphocytes.We conclude that NFAT5 facilitates cell proliferation under hypertonic conditions by inducing an osmoadaptive response that enables cells to express fundamental regulators needed for cell cycle progression."
https://openalex.org/W2055150577,"Previous studies have implicated CXCL12 in the neuropathogenesis of HIV infection. Proteolysis of CXCL12 generates a neurotoxic molecule, CXCL12(5-67), which engages and activates CXCR3, in addition to exhibiting increased expression in the brains of patients with HIV-associated dementia (HAD). Herein, we investigated CXCR3-mediated neuronal injury, particularly, its contribution to autophagy suppression and the concomitant effects of antiretroviral therapy using human brain samples and models of HIV neuropathogenesis. Neurons in the brains of HAD patients and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals, as well as cultured human neurons, expressed CXCR3, which was modulated in a ligand-specific manner. Exposure of human neurons to CXCL12(5-67) caused a reduction in the autophagy-associated molecule LC3 (P<0.05) and neuronal survival (P<0.05), which recapitulated findings in FIV- and HIV-infected brains (P<0.05). Oral didanosine (ddI) treatment of FIV-infected animals reduced neurobehavioral abnormalities in conjunction with diminished plasma viral load (P<0.05). F4/80 transcript abundance and CXCL12(5-67) immunoreactivity were reduced with restored neuronal LC3 expression in the brains of FIV-infected animals after ddI treatment (P<0.05). ddI treatment also prevented microglial activation and depletion of synaptic proteins in the cortex of FIV-infected animals (P<0.05). These findings indicate that the beneficial effects of ddI might be a consequence of a reduced systemic viral burden and concurrent leukocyte activation, leading to diminished neuroinflammation with preservation of neuronal autophagy by regulating CXCR3 activation."

We screened sera of 94 melanoma patients for anti-melanoma reactivity and detected seropositivity in two-thirds of the patients with 2–6 antigens per case detected by 1D and an average of 2.3 per case by 2D Western blot analysis. For identification, antigen spots in Western blots were aligned with proteins in 2-DE and analyzed by mass spectrometry. 18 antigens were identified, 17 of which for the first time for melanoma. One of these antigens, galectin-3, has been related to various oncogenic processes including metastasis formation and invasiveness. Similarly, enolase has been found deregulated in different cancers.

https://openalex.org/W2004858919,"Background Lipid metabolism in mammals is orchestrated by a family of transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) that control the expression of genes required for the uptake and synthesis of cholesterol, fatty acids, and triglycerides. SREBPs are thus essential for insulin-induced lipogenesis and for cellular membrane homeostasis and biogenesis. Although multiple players have been identified that control the expression and activation of SREBPs, gaps remain in our understanding of how SREBPs are coordinated with other physiological pathways. Methodology To identify novel regulators of SREBPs, we performed a genome-wide cDNA over-expression screen to identify proteins that might modulate the transcription of a luciferase gene driven from an SREBP–specific promoter. The results were verified through secondary biological assays and expression data were analyzed by a novel application of the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) method. Conclusions/Significance We screened 10,000 different cDNAs and identified a number of genes and pathways that have previously not been implicated in SREBP control and cellular cholesterol homeostasis. These findings further our understanding of lipid biology and should lead to new insights into lipid associated disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2063403608,"In animal models of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV), the proportion of CD45RC T cell subsets is important for disease susceptibility. Their human counterparts are, however, functionally ill defined. In this report, we studied their distribution in healthy controls (HC), AAV patients and in Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) patients as disease controls. We showed that CD45RC expression level on human CD4 and CD8 T cells identifies subsets that are highly variable among individuals. Interestingly, AAV patients exhibit an increased proportion of CD45RC(low) CD4 T cells as compared to HC and SLE patients. This increase is stable over time and independent of AAV subtype, ANCA specificity, disease duration, or number of relapses. We also analyzed the cytokine profile of purified CD4 and CD8 CD45RC T cell subsets from HC, after stimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 mAbs. The CD45RC subsets exhibit different cytokine profiles. Type-1 cytokines (IL-2, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) were produced by all CD45RC T cell subsets, while the production of IL-17, type-2 (IL-4, IL-5) and regulatory (IL-10) cytokines was restricted to the CD45RC(low) subset. In conclusion, we have shown that CD45RC expression divides human T cells in functionally distinct subsets that are imbalanced in AAV. Since this imbalance is stable over time and independent of several disease parameters, we hypothesize that this is a pre-existing immune abnormality involved in the etiology of AAV."
https://openalex.org/W2015265405,"Commercial SNP microarrays now provide comprehensive and affordable coverage of the human genome. However, some diseases have biologically relevant genomic regions that may require additional coverage. Addiction, for example, is thought to be influenced by complex interactions among many relevant genes and pathways. We have assembled a list of 486 biologically relevant genes nominated by a panel of experts on addiction. We then added 424 genes that showed evidence of association with addiction phenotypes through mouse QTL mappings and gene co-expression analysis. We demonstrate that there are a substantial number of SNPs in these genes that are not well represented by commercial SNP platforms. We address this problem by introducing a publicly available SNP database for addiction. The database is annotated using numeric prioritization scores indicating the extent of biological relevance. The scores incorporate a number of factors such as SNP/gene functional properties (including synonymy and promoter regions), data from mouse systems genetics and measures of human/mouse evolutionary conservation. We then used HapMap genotyping data to determine if a SNP is tagged by a commercial microarray through linkage disequilibrium. This combination of biological prioritization scores and LD tagging annotation will enable addiction researchers to supplement commercial SNP microarrays to ensure comprehensive coverage of biologically relevant regions."
https://openalex.org/W2064603131,"Background The earliest changes associated with airflow obstruction in asthmatic children are a proportionally greater reduction in FEF50% than in FEV1 using spirometry, and an increase in specific airway resistance (sRaw) using body plethysmography. Consequently, we hypothesized that sRaw could be better linked to FEF50% than to FEV1. The first aim was to assess the relationships between forced expiratory flows and sRaw in a large group of asthmatic children in a transversal study. We then performed a longitudinal study in order to determine whether sRaw of preschool children could predict subsequent impairment of forced expiratory flows at school age. Methodology Pulmonary function tests (sRaw and forced expiratory flows) of 2193 asthmatic children were selected for a transversal analysis, while 365 children were retrospectively selected for longitudinal assessment from preschool to school age. Principal Findings The transversal data showed that sRaw is differently related to FEF50% (−1/sRaw) and to FEV1 (near linearly). These results were further explained by a simple one-compartment lung model, which justified the shape of the observed relationships. As hypothesized, sRaw correlated more strongly to FEF50% than to FEV1 (r = −0.64 versus −0.39, respectively; p<0.001). In the longitudinal part of the study, sRaw at preschool age correlated with subsequent FEF50% (% predicted) (−0.31, 95% CI, −0.40 to −0.22), but weakly with subsequent FEV1 (% predicted) (−0.09, 95% CI, −0.20 to 0). Conclusion Specific Raw is more strongly related to FEF50% than to FEV1 and could be used in preschool children to predict subsequent mild airflow limitation."
https://openalex.org/W2006405993,"The epidemiology of Molluscum contagiosum (MC) in the United States is largely unknown, despite the fact that the virus is directly communicable and large outbreaks occur. This study provides population-based estimates to describe the epidemiology of MC in the United States among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) persons. This population was selected because of the comprehensiveness and quality of available data describing utilization of out-patient services.Outpatient visits listing MC as a diagnosis in the Indian Health Service National Patient Information Reporting System during 2001-2005 were analyzed to assess patient characteristics, visit frequency and concurrent skin conditions. Outpatient visit rates and incidence rates were calculated based on known population denominators (retrospective cohort). Overall outpatient visit rates were also calculated for the general US population using national data. The average annual rate of MC-associated outpatient visits was 20.15/10,000 AI/AN persons for 2001-2005 (13,711 total visits), which was similar to the rate for the general US population (22.0/10,000 [95% CI: 16.9-27.1]). The incidence of MC-associated visits was 15.34/10,000. AI/AN children 1-4 years old had the highest incidence (77.12), more than twice that for children 5-14 years old (30.79); the incidence for infants (<1 year) was higher than that for adults. AI/AN persons living in the West region had the highest incidence, followed by those in the East and Alaska regions (26.96, 22.88 and 21.38, respectively). There were age-specific associations between MC and concurrent skin conditions (e.g., atopic dermatitis, eczema).This study highlights the need for periodic population-based measurements to assess trends in incidence and healthcare utilization for MC in the United States. High rates of MC were found among AI/AN persons, especially among children <15 years old. The AI/AN population would benefit from greater availability of effective strategies for prevention and treatment of MCV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2016161257,"Most HIV-infected patients receiving virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy continue to have abnormal, generalized T cell activation. We explored whether the degree of ongoing cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) replication was associated with higher virus-specific T cell activation and the failure to achieve normal absolute CD4+ T cell counts in the face of long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy.Longitudinally collected PBMC and saliva specimens obtained from HIV-infected patients on effective antiretroviral therapy for at least one year (plasma HIV RNA <75 copies/mL) were examined using a multiplex CMV, EBV and KSHV DNA PCR assay. Eleven cases were chosen who had CD8+ T cell CD38+HLA-DR+ expression >10% and plateau absolute CD4+ T cell counts <500 cells/microL. Five controls from the same study had CD8+ T cell CD38 expression <10% and plateau absolute CD4+ T cell counts >500 cells/microL.Among all subjects combined, 18% of PMBC samples were positive for CMV DNA, and 27%, 73% and 24% of saliva samples were positive for CMV, EBV and KSHV DNA, respectively. No significant differences or trends were observed between cases and controls in proportions of all CMV, EBV or KSHV DNA positive specimens, proportions of subjects in each group that intermittently or continuously shed CMV, EBV or KSHV DNA in saliva, or the median number of genome copies of CMV, EBV and KSHV DNA in saliva. Overall, number of genome copies in saliva were lower for KSHV than for CMV and lower for CMV than for EBV. Although replication of CMV, EBV and KSHV persists in many antiretroviral-suppressed, HIV-infected patients, we observed no evidence in this pilot case-control study that the magnitude of such human herpesvirus replication is associated with abnormally increased CD8+ T cell activation and sub-normal plateau absolute CD4+ T cell counts following virologically suppressive antiretroviral therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2018201532,"Parental genome functions in ontogeny are determined by interactions among transcripts from the maternal and paternal genomes, which contain many genes whose expression is strictly dependent on their parental origin as a result of genomic imprinting. Comprehensive recognition of the interactions between parental genomes is important for understanding genomic imprinting in mammalian development. The placenta is a key organ for exploring the biological significance of genomic imprinting. To decipher the unknown roles of paternally methylated imprinted genes on chromosomes 7 and 12 in mouse placentation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on placentae in three types of bimaternal conceptuses that contained genomes derived from both non-growing and fully grown oocytes. Furthermore, we used the Ingenuity pathway analysis software to predict key networks and identify functions specific to paternally methylated imprinted genes regulated by the Igf2-H19 imprinting control region and Dlk1-Dio3 imprinting control region.

These results provide a framework to further explore the role of epigenetic modifications in paternal genome during mouse placentation."
https://openalex.org/W1991072028,"High intraindividual performance variability is one of the most robust findings to emerge in cognitive-experimental research of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Evidences from studies incorporating structural or functional human brain mapping methods indicate that this increased intraindividual variability is not simply a sequel of general brain dysfunction, but is likely related to the functioning of neural circuits that engage the prefrontal cortex, particularly the dorsolateral areas (dlPFC). In order to examine further the anatomical and pharmacological substrate responsible for this high intraindividual variability disorder, we injected GABAA antagonist (bicuculline) or GABAA agonist (muscimol) in the dlPFC of monkeys performing a reflexive oculomotor task. Here we show that, whereas GABAA agonist injection induced no or minimal impairments, injection of GABAA antagonist dramatically increased the intraindividual variability of saccade response time and of saccade spatial accuracy (amplitude and direction). Overall, this study demonstrates that the balance between excitatory/inhibitory activities in the dlPFC is fragile but crucial, since local micro-injection of GABAA antagonist can induce marked behavioural effects. It also reveals that higher cognitive areas such as the dlPFC are markedly capable to influence the productions and metrics of reflexive movements. Altogether, this study provides promising perspectives for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases in which high intravariability disorders are a prominent feature."

Open table in a new tab Aspartate and Glutamate Residues of hCNT3There are 11 highly conserved negatively charged residues in hCNT3. Ten of these are also present in hCNT1/2, whereas one is unique to CNT3/hfCNT subfamily members.Substitution of 9 of 11 acidic amino acids in hCNT3 with the corresponding neutral amino acid was without effect. Two of these (D503N and E553Q) corresponded to mutants in hCNT1 (D482N and E532Q) that were retained in intracellular membranes (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E.

Another (E329Q) corresponded to an hCNT1 mutant (E308Q) that was processed normally to the cell surface but exhibited impaired transport activity (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M.

Because hCNT3 E329Q exhibited wild-type transport function, this residue may have roles specific to hCNT1 or, perhaps, to the CNT1/CNT2 subfamily.Subsequent studies focused exclusively on the remaining two hCNT3 acidic amino acids Glu-343 and Glu-519. In addition to insertion of glutamine at these positions, the residues were also mutated to aspartate and cysteine. Different from hCNT1 (Table 5), all constructs were targeted to the oocyte plasma membrane, enabling their characterization by both radioisotope flux and electrophysiological techniques.Glu-343, Functional ConsiderationsLocated in TM 7 (Fig. 1), mutation of Glu-343 to glutamine had marked effects on hCNT3 kinetics. Similar to the corresponding hCNT1 mutant E322Q (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30607-30617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), E343Q retained the ability to bind uridine, although the translocation capacity (i.e. transporter turnover number) was dramatically decreased. Also like hCNT1 E322Q (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30607-30617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), E343Q retained the ability to bind and transport Na+, but only with low affinity. Thus, uridine influx and uridine-induced currents were higher in Na+-containing medium than in Na+-free medium, and cation activation analysis revealed a linear relationship between Na+ concentration and uridine influx. No H+ dependence of transport was evident, and although small uridine-induced currents were observed in Na+-free media, the magnitudes of these currents did not respond to changes in external pH.Extending the previous findings of Na+-leak currents for hCNT1 mutant E322Q (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30607-30617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), E343Q charge:flux experiments revealed uncoupled uridine-induced cation movement through the transporter in both Na+-containing, H+-reduced, and Na+-free acidified transport media. Because the range of apparent coupling ratios encountered in these experiments was similar in both Na+-containing, H+-reduced, and Na+-free acidified transport media, H+ movement did not seem to account for the small pH-independent currents seen under the latter condition. Instead, we hypothesize that small local concentrations of Na+ in the immediate vicinity of the oocyte cell surface, in conjunction with the uncoupled Na+ flux, may have been responsible for the minor E343Q currents seen under otherwise Na+-free conditions. The current-voltage (I-V) curves in Na+-containing, H+-reduced, and Na+-free acidified transport media and broad nucleoside selectivity and impaired transport of guanosine under both conditions support this possibility.Providing important additional new evidence of uridine-gated uncoupled Na+ flux, hCNT3 mutant E343Q exhibited an ohmic relationship between uridine-induced current and membrane potential. Residues of other transporters for which mutation causes uncoupled behavior include Asp-204 of the human Na+-dependent glucose transporter SGLT1 and Asn-177 of the rat 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (41Quick M. Loo D.D. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1728-1734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 42Lin F. Lester H.A. Mager S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3126-3135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).Restoring the negative charge at hCNT3 residue position Glu-343 by mutation to aspartate (E343D) regained the wild-type phenotype, although Vmax values for uridine transport and cation activation were lower than those for hCNT3. Thus, both the presence and positioning of the Glu-343 negative charge are critical for normal functional activity.New evidence of the importance of hCNT3 Glu-343 also arose from its mutation to cysteine (E343C). Compromised kinetically with respect to both uridine transport and Na+/H+-activation, and with a marked decrease in Na+ binding affinity, E343C exhibited small uridine-evoked H+ currents relative to those of Na+. Additionally, E343C demonstrated Na+:uridine coupling features intermediate between those of E343Q (uncoupled) and E343D (fully coupled). Different from wild-type hCNT3, however, the mean Na+:uridine stoichiometry was 1:1. E343C nevertheless retained sigmoid Na+-activation kinetics, indicating retention of both Na+-binding sites. Similar to E343Q, E343C showed decreased transport of the purine nucleoside guanosine. E343 therefore functions in determination of both cation coupling and nucleoside specificity.Glu-519, Functional ConsiderationshCNT3 Glu-519 was also revealed to have key roles in cation/nucleoside cotransport. This residue resides in putative TM 11A (Fig. 1) and is centrally positioned in the highly conserved (G/A)XKX3NEFVA(Y/M/F) motif common to all eukaryote and prokaryote CNTs. Previous indications for a role of this residue in CNT function comes from studies of the corresponding residue in hCNT1, for which mutant E498D exhibited a modest reduction in Vmax value for Na+, and a small increase in apparent Km value for uridine (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30607-30617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Anticipated to show more pronounced phenotypic changes, hCNT1 mutant E498Q was not processed to the cell surface in oocytes and therefore could not be analyzed functionally (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30607-30617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). hCNT1 E498C was also nonfunctional, presumably for the same reason (31Yao S.Y. Ng A.M. Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 30607-30617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In the case of hCNT3, however, all three hCNT3 Glu-519 mutants (E519Q, E519D, and E519C) were processed to the oocyte cell surface similar to wild-type hCNT3 providing, for the first time, a means to assess the role of this glutamate residue in CNT Na+/nucleoside cotransport.Despite its confirmed presence in the oocyte plasma membrane, hCNT3 mutant E519Q showed no measurable transport activity and therefore is the first reported example of a mutation in hCNT3 rendering the protein catalytically inactive. Mutation of Glu-519 to aspartate (E519D), which restored a negative charge at this position, also fully restored Na+-coupled functional activity, with only small kinetic differences from the wild-type transporter. Similar to E343Q and E343C, however, and to a greater extent than E343D, this protein showed severely reduced H+-dependent uridine uptake compared with hCNT3, and barely detectable uridine-evoked H+ currents. Thus, H+ coupling has more stringent requirements for the positioning of the Glu-519 negative charge than Na+ coupling.Altered interaction with H+ was also evident for E519C with radiolabeled uptake assays and current measurements both reporting no detectable H+-mediated uridine uptake. Additionally, E519C showed preference for pyrimidine nucleosides compared with purine nucleosides (uridine > cytidine, thymidine > adenosine, inosine > guanosine) and, kinetically, exhibited large decreases in uridine and Na+ binding affinity and Na+ Vmax, with the change in Na+ binding resembling that for E343C. In contrast to wild-type hCNT3 (19Smith K.M. Slugoski M.D. Loewen S.K. Ng A.M. Yao S.Y. Chen X.Z. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25436-25449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), E519C also exhibited an apparent absence of voltage dependence of Na+ K50. As well, flux/charge experiments found a change in Na+:nucleoside stoichiometry from 2:1 to 1:1, a characteristic shared by the more variable Na+ coupling of E343C. Differences in the stringency of altered Na+ coupling between E519C and E343C nevertheless reinforce other indications of dissimilar mechanistic roles of the two residue positions.Recently, a naturally occurring hCNT3 variant has been described in the Spanish population in which Cys-602 is substituted by arginine (43Errasti-Murugarren E. Cano-Soldado P. Pastor-Anglada M. Casado F.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2008; 73: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This single amino acid replacement in TM 13 leads to a shift in Hill coefficient consistent with a possible change in Na+:nucleoside stoichiometry from 2:1 to 1:1. In contrast, both of the hCNT3 mutants with altered stoichiometry investigated in this study (E343C and E519C) retained sigmoidal Na+-activation curves. With calculated Hill coefficients of 1.4 (E343C) and 1.9 (E519C), it is possible that both of these constructs still bind two Na+ ions but that only one is translocated.In studies of wild-type hCNT1 and hCNT3, we have established that Na+ binds to the transporter first, increasing the affinity for nucleoside, which then binds second (19Smith K.M.

The hCNT3C− construct subcloned into pGEM-HE was sequenced in both directions by Taq dyedeoxy-terminator cycle sequencing to confirm that the correct base substitutions had been made. In hCNT3C−, residues were individually converted into cysteine using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Constructs were sequenced in both directions to confirm that the anticipated mutation had been introduced. Plasmid DNA was linearized and transcribed with T7 polymerase using the mMESSAGE mMACHINETM (Ambion) transcription system. Defolliculated stage VI Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with 20 nl of water or 20 nl of water containing capped RNA transcripts (20 ng) and incubated in modified Barth's medium (changed daily) at 18 °C for 72 h prior to assay of transport activity. Transport assays were performed as described previously (26Slugoski M.D. Ng A.M. Yao S.Y. Smith K.M. Lin C.C. Zhang J. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol.

Groups of 12 oocytes were incubated at room temperature (20 °C) in 200 μl of transport medium containing either 100 mm NaCl or choline chloride (ChCl), and 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 8.5) or MES (pH 5.5). Uptake was traced with 14C- or 3H-labeled uridine (1 or 2 μCi/ml, respectively) (GE Healthcare) at a concentration of 10 μm. One-min uptake intervals were used to measure initial rates of transport (influx), with the exception of mutants F482C(C−), E483C(C−), Y558C(C−), A601C(C−), and A609C(C−), which showed low rates of influx and thus were subjected to 5-min uptake intervals. At the end of the incubation period, extracellular label was removed by seven rapid washes in ice-cold Na+-free (choline chloride) transport medium (100 mm ChCl, pH 7.5), and individual oocytes were dissolved in 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of oocyte-associated radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6000 IC; Beckman). Also in a volume of 200 μl, oocytes were treated on ice for 10 min with 200 μm PCMBS. Excess PCMBS was removed by three washes with ice-cold transport medium before the assay of transport activity. In protection experiments, unlabeled uridine (20 mm) was included along with PCMBS (26Slugoski M.D. Ng A.M. Yao S.Y. Smith K.M. Lin C.C. Zhang J. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J.

For ease of comparison, all uptake values are reported in units of pmol/oocyte·min−1. The presence of recombinant hCNT3C− and hCNT3C− mutant proteins at oocyte cell surfaces was determined by labeling intact oocytes with EZ-Link sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) followed by isolation of the resulting biotinylated plasma membrane proteins using immobilized streptavidin resin (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblotting, solubilized proteins (one oocyte/lane) were resolved on NuPAGE® Novex® BisTris minigels (Invitrogen). The electrophoresed proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (GE Healthcare) and probed with affinity-purified anti-hCNT3-(45–69) polyclonal antibodies (35Damaraju V.L.

Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Pierce) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Pierce). All 14 endogenous cysteine residues of hCNT3 were replaced with serine to produce hCNT3C−, a cysteineless hCNT3 construct (24Zhang J. Tackaberry T. Ritzel M.W. Raborn T. Barron G. Baldwin S.A.

The 133 residues spanning a region between and including TMs 11–13 that were investigated in the present study are highlighted in Fig. 1. hCNT3 transports nucleosides using both Na+ and H+ electrochemical gradients (18Smith K.M.

Therefore, to examine the functional activity of single cysteine mutants, uptake of 10 μm radiolabeled uridine was determined in both Na+-containing, H+-reduced medium (100 mm NaCl, pH 8.5) and Na+-free, acidified medium (100 mm ChCl, pH 5.5, respectively). The Na+-containing medium was buffered at a pH of 8.5 to avoid the small but significant H+ activation of hCNT3 that occurs at pH 7.5 (18Smith K.M. Slugoski M.D. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Karpinski E.

Previously, we have verified that Na+-coupled uridine transport by hCNT3 at pH 8.5 is kinetically indistinguishable from that at pH 7.5 (25Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M. Mulinta R. Ng A.M. Yao S.Y.

Initial rates of transport ± S.E. for each mutant, in units of pmol/oocyte·min−1, are given in supplemental Table 1. The uptake of 10 μm radiolabeled uridine (100 mm NaCl, pH 8.5) by oocytes expressing hCNT3C− varied between experiments, ranging from 2–4 pmol/oocyte·min−1 (data not shown). The flux values reported in supplemental Table 1 and elsewhere throughout, depict mediated transport activity, defined as the difference in uptake between RNA transcript-injected and control water-injected oocytes, and are from representative experiments. In all studies reported here, uridine uptake in water-injected oocytes was <0.02 pmol/oocyte·min−1 (data not shown). Mutants exhibiting uridine uptake values of <0.1 pmol/oocyte·min−1 were excluded from further analysis (supplemental Table 1). Only 9 of the 133 residues investigated fell into this category (6.8%), and in every case, the mutation to cysteine resulted in a protein with low functional activity in both Na+-containing, H+-reduced and Na+-free, acidified media (100 mm NaCl, pH 8.5, and 100 mm ChCl, pH 5.5, respectively). The nine residues were as follows: Met496 and Gly498 in TM 11; Glu519 in TM 11A; Phe563 and Ser568 in TM 12; and Arg593, Ala594, Ala606, and Gly610 in TM 13. Cell surface labeling with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin and immobilized streptavidin resin were used to distinguish cell surface proteins from those associated with total (plasma + intracellular) membranes. Three of the nine mutants (residues Gly498, Phe563, and Ser568) that exhibited low levels of functional activity were present at cell surfaces in amounts and with electrophoretic mobilities similar to hCNT3C− (data not shown). The others were truncated (residue Met496) or present at cell surfaces in reduced amounts (residues Glu519, Arg593, Ala594, Ala606, and Gly610) (data not shown). To facilitate comparisons between the remaining 124 mutants, the uridine transport activity of each construct is presented as the flux ratio of Na+-mediated to H+-mediated uptake (Na+/H+) in supplemental Table 1. The corresponding Na+/H+ ratios of uridine uptake (10 μm) for wild-type hCNT3 and cysteineless hCNT3C− were ∼1.7 and 1.0, respectively (averaged results from multiple experiments; data not shown), and were in good agreement with results of previous studies (18Smith K.M.

Residue mutations that resulted in Na+/H+ ratios of uridine uptake of <0.5 and >2.5 (supplemental Table 1) are highlighted in the hCNT3 topology schematic shown in Fig. 2. All mutants in TM 11, TM 13, and the loop between TMs 12 and 13 exhibited Na+/H+ uptake ratios similar to that of hCNT3/hCNT3C−. In contrast, mutant Y558C(C−) in TM 12 exhibited a ratio of 0.2, and three other TM 12 mutants exhibited ratios of >2.5 (A564C(C−), N565C(C−), and I566C(C−)) with values of 5.0, 3.3, and 2.6, respectively. A cluster of residues with altered cation coupling characteristics was evident in the loop between TMs 11 and 12. Mutation of residue Tyr513 to cysteine resulted in a Na+/H+ ratio of 0.4, and mutation of six other residues resulted in Na+/H+ ratios of >2.5 (G512C(C−), 3.9; K514C(C−), 7.9; F516C(C−), 3.1; A522C(C−), 7.0; E524C(C−), 2.6; H525C(C−), 2.7). All seven of these residues lie within predicted TM 11A, with five located within the conserved CNT family (G/A)XKX3NEFVA(Y/M/F) motif. In hCNT3, this motif corresponds to residues GYKTFFNEFVAY, which span the region from Gly512 to Tyr523. Although the transport activity of E519C(C−) was <0.1 pmol/oocyte·min−1 and therefore not analyzed in the present study, we have previously characterized the transport activities of two Glu519 mutants (E519D and E519C) in an hCNT3 wild-type background (30Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M.

Both of these mutants displayed robust transport of uridine in the presence of Na+ but only low (E519D) or not detectable (E519C) levels of transport activity in Na+-free, acidified medium (30Slugoski M.D. Smith K.M.

https://openalex.org/W2069253583,"Background Bacteria engage cell surface receptors and intracellular signaling molecules to enter the cell. Unc119 is an adaptor protein, which interacts with receptors and tyrosine kinases. Its role in bacterial invasion of cells is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings We used biochemical, molecular and cell biology approaches to identify the binding partners of Unc119, and to study the effect of Unc119 on Abl family kinases and Shigella infection. We employed loss-of-function and gain-in-function approaches to study the effect of Unc119 in a mouse model of pulmonary shigellosis. Unc119 interacts with Abl family kinases and inhibits their kinase activity. As a consequence, it inhibits Crk phosphorylation, which is essential for Shigella infection. Unc119 co-localizes with Crk and Shigella in infected cells. Shigella infectivity increases in Unc119-deficient epithelial and macrophage cells. In a mouse model of shigellosis cell-permeable TAT-Unc119 inhibits Shigella infection. Conversely, Unc119 knockdown in vivo results in enhanced bacterial invasion and increased lethality. Unc119 is an inducible protein. Its expression is upregulated by probacteria and bacterial products such as lipopolysacharide and sodium butyrate. The latter inhibits Shigella infection in mouse lungs but is ineffective in Unc119 deficiency. Conclusions Unc119 inhibits signaling pathways that are used by Shigella to enter the cell. As a consequence it provides partial but significant protection from Shigella infections. Unc119 induction in vivo boosts host defense against infections."
https://openalex.org/W2020826595,"Gene transfer via bacterial integrons is a major pathway for facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance genes across bacteria. Recently the mechanism underlying the recombination catalyzed by class 1 integron recombinase (IntI1) between attC and attI1 was highlighted demonstrating the involvement of a single-stranded intermediary on the attC site. However, the process allowing the generation of this single-stranded substrate has not been determined, nor have the active IntI1•DNA complexes been identified. Using the in vitro strand transfer assay and a crosslink strategy we previously described we demonstrated that the single-stranded attC sequences could be generated in the absence of other bacterial proteins in addition to IntI. This suggests a possible role for this protein in stabilizing and/or generating this structure. The mechanism of folding of the active IntI•DNA complexes was further analyzed and we show here that it involves a cooperative binding of the protein to each recombination site and the emergence of different oligomeric species specific for each DNA substrate. These findings provide further insight into the recombination reaction catalyzed by IntI1."
https://openalex.org/W2092059323,"Background International targets for access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) have over-estimated the capacity of health systems in low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The WHO target for number on treatment by end 2005 for Tanzania was 10 times higher than actually achieved. The target of the national Care and Treatment Plan (CTP) was also not reached. We aimed at estimating the capacity for ART provision and created five scenarios for ART production given existing resource limitations. Methods A situation analysis including scrutiny of staff factors, such as available data on staff and patient factors including access to ART and patient losses, made us conclude that the lack of clinical staff is the main limiting factor for ART scale-up, assuming that sufficient drugs and supplies are provided by donors. We created a simple formula to estimate the number of patients on ART based on availability and productivity of clinical staff, time needed to initiate vs maintain a patient on ART and patient losses using five different scenarios with varying levels of these parameters. Findings Our scenario assuming medium productivity (40% higher than that observed in 2002) and medium loss of patients (20% in addition to 15% first-year mortality) coincides with the actual reported number of patients initiated on ART up to 2008, but is considerably below the national CTP target of 90% coverage for 2009, corresponding to 420,000 on ART and 710,000 life-years saved (LY's). Our analysis suggests that a coverage of 40% or 175,000 on treatment and 350,000 LY's saved is more achievable. Conclusion A comparison of our scenario estimations and actual output 2006–2008 indicates that a simple user-friendly dynamic model can estimate the capacity for ART scale-up in resource-poor settings based on identification of a limiting staff factor and information on availability of this staff and patient losses. Thus, it is possible to set more achievable targets."
