https://openalex.org/W2134699973,"Evidence from several model systems suggests that nonhistone chromosomal proteins may regulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The data indicate that the synthesis of new species of nonhistone chromosomal proteins as well as modifications of preexisting nonhistone chromosomal proteins are involved in the control of transcription. However, from the vast number of proteins included in this class, it is apparent that, in addition to regulating the transcription of defined genome loci, the nonhistone chromosomal proteins include enzymes that have a general function, proteins that are involved in determining the structure of chromatin, as well as proteins that serve as recognition sites for binding of regulatory macromolecules. The presence of a nucleoplasmic pool of nonhistone chromosomal proteins which may exchange with the chromatin has also been reported (89). While it is clear that the nonhistone chromosomal proteins play a key role in the regulation of gene expression, the exact manner in which they interact with the genome to initiate, modify, or augment the transcription of specific RNA molecules remains to be resolved."

Switching occurs reversibly at potential gradients two to three orders of magnitude lower than reported for inorganic thin films, and comparable to gradients existing in some biological systems. Of a number of other biological materials tested, only cytochrome c acted similarly, but at the high potential gradients reported for thin film amorphous semiconductors."
https://openalex.org/W1548524206,"Abstract The kinetic characteristics of glucagon action and binding as functions of hormone and nucleotide concentrations have been investigated in the hepatic adenylate cyclase system. Either App(NH)p (5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate), 0.1 mm, or ATP, 2 mm, was used as substrate. The formation of adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) in response to glucagon exhibits lag times as long as 4 min in the presence of about 0.1 nm glucagon. The lag times diminish as the hormone or substrate concentrations increase. Addition of GTP (0.1 mm) abolishes the lags at all concentrations of glucagon tested in the presence of 0.1 mm App(NH)p and causes a decrease in the concentration of glucagon required for half-maximal activation of the enzyme. In the presence of GTP, the apparent Km for glucagon action ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 nm glucagon; in its absence, the Km ranges from 2 to 7 nm. Pretreatment of the enzyme system with glucagon for 15 min prior to addition of substrate also abolishes the lags seen at low concentrations of the hormone. When the pretreated enzyme system is incubated with limiting concentrations of substrate (0.1 mm App(NH)p) in the absence of free hormone, the velocity of enzyme activity is dependent upon GTP. Stimulatory effects are observed with 30 nm GTP; GTP exerts maximal effects at 1 µm. The lag times observed in onset of glucagon activation appear to reflect a change in state of the enzyme induced by glucagon binding to its receptor. The time dependency is changed simply by increasing the concentration of glucagon; GTP acts subsequent to or attendant upon this change in state induced by glucagon. Glucagon binding exhibits Hill coefficients of about 1.5, suggesting cooperative interactions between two or more subunits of the system. GTP, in addition to its effects on glucagon action, stimulates the rate of dissociation of glucagon from its receptor and, as a consequence, causes a decrease in the steady state levels of bound glucagon. The release of hormone seems not to be causally related to enzyme activation since the rates of dissociation are increased by addition of 0.1 mm GTP without concomitant increases in enzyme velocity. A hyperbolic relationship is observed between the levels of receptors occupied by glucagon and adenylate cyclase activity generated in the presence of GTP. Complete activation of the enzyme requires full occupation of the specific binding sites in hepatic plasma membranes (about 3 pmoles per mg of membrane protein). This finding shows that all of the specific binding sites for glucagon in these membranes represent receptors functionally and structurally linked to the adenylate cyclase system. The finding that glucagon and GTP activate adenylate cyclase by a concerted or interdependent mechanism is discussed in relation to the characteristics of the adenylate cyclase system as an allosteric regulatory enzyme system."

https://openalex.org/W1504680742,"Tropoelastin, the non-cross-linked precursor of the elastic fiber, is shown by electron microscopy to form filaments upon coacervation. These results, which are similar to those previously observed for α-elastin, suggest that the hydrophobic interactions involved in coacervation are an ordering force prior to cross-linkage."
https://openalex.org/W1625133606,"Abstract Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that cytochrome c oxidase from bakers' yeast consists of seven polypeptides. The three largest ones (molecular weights 42,000, 34,500, and 23,000) are synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes, whereas the four smallest ones (molecular weights 14,000, 12,500, 12,500, and 9,500) are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes. In order to study the assembly of the functional oligomeric enzyme, four cytochrome c oxidase-less mutants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain D273-10B were analyzed for residual cytochrome c oxidase polypeptides. Three were nuclear mutants specifically deficient in cytochrome c oxidase; the fourth mutant was an extrachromosomally inherited petite strain lacking not only cytochrome c oxidase but several other mitochondrial components as well. Cytochrome c oxidase polypeptides in the respiration-deficient mitochondria were identified by immunodiffusion and by electrophoretic analysis of radioactively labeled immunoprecipitates. Each of the three nuclear mutants lacked at least one cytochrome c oxidase component which, in the wild type, is synthesized on mitochondrial ribosomes. Mutant pet 494 was devoid of the 23,000-dalton polypeptide, whereas mutants pet E11 and pet 1030 were almost completely deficient in all three large cytochrome oxidase polypeptides. All nuclear mutants possessed near normal amounts of the cytoplasmically synthesized cytochrome c oxidase components. The extrachromosomal petite mutant lacked not only the three mitochondrially synthesized polypeptides, but also the 9,500-dalton polypeptide which is a product of cytoplasmic protein synthesis. The remaining cytochrome oxidase subunits were only loosely bound to the mitochondrial membrane, differing in this respect from the corresponding subunits in wild type mitochondria. These results permit the following conclusions. 1. The polypeptide of molecular weight 23,000 is apparently an essential component of cytochrome c oxidase, since its absence in mutant pet 494 is paralleled by a specific loss of the functional enzyme. 2. The mitochondrially synthesized cytochrome c oxidase subunits are necessary for the tight binding of the cytoplasmically synthesized cytochrome c oxidase subunits to the mitochondrial inner membrane. 3. The synthesis (or intregration) of mitochondrially synthesized cytochrome c oxidase subunits can be prevented by nuclear mutations. Conversely, extrachromosomal mutations can impair or completely prevent the integration of cytoplasmically synthesized cytochrome c oxidase subunits. These experiments also showed that, under our conditions, the three large subunits of cytochrome c oxidase account for 20 to 25% of the protein synthesized by mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W1563304780,"Abstract Evidence is presented that electron transfer between different molecules of cytochrome b5 does not occur at an appreciable rate in microsomes. In view of this fact, the earlier observation that a large excess of functional amphipathic cytochrome b5 can be bound to microsomes suggests that cytochrome b5 and NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase are randomly distributed on the microsomal membrane. This model requires translational diffusion of these proteins within the membrane prior to interaction. The dependence of the rate of reduction of microsomal cytochrome b5 by NADH upon the concentration of cytochrome b5 and the effect of partial inactivation of microsomal NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase on the extent of cytochrome b5 reduction are both consistent with this model for the microsomal membrane. The evidence indicates that the interaction of the active sites of cytochrome b5 and reductase is not significantly altered by binding to the membrane and suggests that the hydrophilic portions of these proteins, although securely bound to the membrane by means of a hydrophobic peptide, may be capable of independent and significant motion in the aqueous phase."
https://openalex.org/W1554796714,"Abstract The phosphorylation of non-histone nuclear proteins has been studied in HeLa S-3 cells during synchronous growth. The uptake of [32P]orthophosphate into individual protein bands separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels varies at different stages in the cell cycle while the banding patterns themselves are remarkably constant. Rates of phosphate uptake into most major phosphoprotein species are increased during the early G1 and early S phases and are minimal during the late G2 to M period. The turnover of previously incorporated phosphoryl groups during a cold chase following a 23-hour exposure to [32P]orthophosphate shows that some proteins lose their phosphoryl residues much more rapidly than do others. The halflives vary from 5 to 12 hours, with an over-all half-life of 6.7 hours. In contrast, the 14C specific activity of the proteins falls to 50% of the original activity in about 25 hours. The retention of [32P]phosphate is a more sensitive index of differential phosphoryl group turnover in different nuclear acidic proteins than is the uptake of [32P]phosphate in short term labeling experiments. If the nuclear phosphoproteins play a role in differential transcription during the cell cycle, changes in phosphorylation would appear to be more significant than changes in relative concentrations of individual protein species."
https://openalex.org/W1515318096,"Abstract Some properties of the interaction between radioiodinated human follicle stimulating hormone (125I-hFSH) and its specific receptors in preparations of rat seminiferous tubule homogenate are described. Specific binding of 125I-hFSH by seminiferous tubule homogenate was appreciably greater than to Leydig cell homogenate of rat testes. The uptake of 125I-hFSH was hormone specific and uptake inhibition seen with purified human luteinizing hormone (hLH) could be attributed to residual FSH activity in the latter. While biologically active FSH inhibited the specific uptake of 125I-hFSH by seminiferous tubule homogenate, biologically inactive FSH, denatured by heat, did not. The system could also be used to follow formation of intact FSH from its α and β subunits, thus further validating the relationship between specific binding and biologic activity. The uptake of 125I-hFSH was tissue specific, since negligible specific binding was seen when a variety of rat tissues other than seminiferous tubule homogenate were examined. The uptake of 125I-hFSH was 1.6-fold greater in seminiferous tubule homogenate derived from testes of mature rats compared to immature (16-day-old) rats. Specific 125I-hFSH uptake was affected by variations in ionic strength, with a maximum uptake, 2.17 x 10-16 moles per mg of homogenate, being noted in 1 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5 and no specific uptake in 0.5 m phosphate buffer, Specific uptake was not affected by substitution of Mg2+ for Ca2+ at the molar concentrations of phosphate described above. Specific binding is temperature-dependent and maximum specific uptake of 125I-hFSH was seen at 37°. Heating of seminiferous tubule homogenate to 60° and above prior to addition of 125I-hFSH abolished specific uptake, whereas nonspecific uptake increased as the temperature was elevated. Specific binding was pH-dependent, with an optimum at pH 7.5. Extremes of pH caused irreversible damage to the receptors and this was a time-dependent process. In our system, specific uptake of 125I-hFSH was a saturable process with respect to hormone concentration, and significant inhibition of uptake by unlabeled hFSH could be detected at 1.06 x 10-16 moles per mg of homogenate using 7.5 x 10-14 moles of 125I-hFSH. Scatchard analysis indicated a Kd of 6.7 x 10-10 m and binding sites are estimated to the 6.2 x 10-14 moles per mg wet tissue weight."
https://openalex.org/W2136288217,"Abstract The physical basis for the confinement of carbamyl phosphate, ornithine, and arginine to specific anabolic fates has been investigated. Cell extracts of Neurospora grown in minimal medium were fractionated by differential centrifugation to determine the subcellular localization of the relevant enzymes. Carbamyl-P synthase A (arginine-specific; EC 2.7.2.5), ornithine acetyltransferase, and ornithine carbamyltransferase (EC 2.1.2.2) were found to be associated with a particulate (organellar) fraction. All three enzymes co-sediment with mitochondria on linear sorbitol gradients, and appear to be components of the mitochondrial matrix. The mitochondrial membrane limits the ability of exogenous substrates to be metabolized by these enzymes in vitro. Arginine synthesis from citrulline, putrescine synthesis from ornithine, and the catabolism of ornithine and arginine are carried out by cytoplasmic enzymes. The catabolic enzymes are found at significant levels even during growth in minimal medium, but little catabolism occurs in vivo. The results indicate that the anabolic and catabolic pathways of ornithine metabolism are, in part, separated by the mitochondrial membrane. However, the mechanisms responsible for confining carbamyl-P and ornithine to arginine synthesis and arginine to protein synthesis are more complex than the simple physical separation of the anabolic and catabolic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1561941210,"Abstract The antiglucocorticoid cortexolone competes with triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for binding to specific receptors in rat thymocytes, and prevents the inhibitory action of TA on 2-deoxy[14C]glucose uptake and on the uptake and incorporation of [3H]uridine in these cells. Different sedimentation profiles were noted for the active glucocorticoid-receptor complex and the hormone antagonist-receptor complex. Thymocytes incubated with [3H]TA at 0° or 37° and extracted with a high salt buffer (0.15 m KCl) yielded a single receptor complex sedimenting at ∼4 S. At 0° and extraction with a low salt buffer, most of the [3H]TA was associated with the 27,000 x g supernatant and complexes sedimenting at ∼3.5 S and ∼7 S were observed in a 5 to 20% sucrose gradient. At 37° and low salt extraction, the [3H]TA was bound to a 27,000 x g pellet (containing 98% cellular DNA) from which it could be extracted with high salt to yield a ∼4 S complex. In contrast, cortexolone yielded a single receptor complex, ∼3.5 S, at both 0° and 37° after extraction of thymocytes with either the low or high salt buffer. Moreover, if the 37° low salt pellet is re-extracted with the high salt buffer, additional [3H]TA-receptor complex could be isolated but this was not the case for the [3H]cortexolone-receptor complex. When the [3H]TA receptor enters the nucleus it is firmly bound to an intranuclear molecule, whereas the cortexolone-receptor when taken up by the nucleus does not bind to an acceptor molecule. It is concluded that the lack of activity of the cortexolone-receptor complex is the result of a conformational change which allows for its uptake by the nucleus but decreases its affinity for a nuclear acceptor site and therefore does not mediate a biological response."
https://openalex.org/W1529471367,"Abstract Binding of adenosine diphosphate by isolated membranes from human platelets has been demonstrated. The process was reversible, temperature-dependent, supported by calcium or magnesium ions, and influenced by the integrity of membrane protein sulfhydryl groups. Prior exposure of the isolated membranes to trypsin, chymotrypsin, or pronase resulted in significant inhibition of [14C]ADP uptake. Extraction of the bound radioactivity and subsequent thin layer chromatographic analysis revealed that the ADP was unchanged. GDP at relatively high concentrations interfered with ADP binding, whereas cyclic AMP, α,β-methylene ADP, adenosine, and PGE1 had no effect. AMP, ATP, and 2-chloroadenosine, known inhibitors of platelet aggregation, significantly blocked [14C]ADP binding. Mersalyl (10-4 m), an inhibitor of actomyosin-type ATPase activity, interfered with [14C]ADP binding by the membrane particles. Scatchard plot analysis suggested that there are approximately 100,000 binding sites per platelet."
https://openalex.org/W1510308087,"Abstract Eighteen respiration-deficient yeast mutants were isolated from wild type cells after mutagenesis with ethylmethane sulfonate. Segregation analysis indicated that each mutant phenotype resulted from the mutation of a single nuclear gene. All mutants except one efficiently retained functional mitochondrial DNA as measured by ability to complement mitochondrial DNA-less tester strains. When the mutants were crossed pairwise and the resulting zygotes checked for functional respiration, the 18 strains could be classified into seven complementation groups. Three of these groups were characterized by a specific loss of cytochrome aa3. Another group included pleiotropic mutants which lacked cytochrome aa3, b, and c1, but not oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATPase. Still another group was represented by a pleiotropic mutant that was not only deficient in cytochromes aa3, b, and c1 but in mitochondrial ATPase as well. The two remaining complementation groups included mutants that were completely deficient in cytochrome aa3 and partially deficient in other mitochondrial constituents. All of the mutants still exhibited mitochondrial protein synthesis. However, when the proteins synthesized by the mutant mitochondria in vivo were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, they usually lacked several species made by wild type mitochondria. These results show that nuclear mutations can affect either the synthesis of mitochondrial translation products or their integration into the mitochondrial inner membrane. Since mitochondrial protein synthesis can still be detected in single gene mutants with multiple mitochondrial deficiencies, we suggest that some nuclear genes may code for mitochondrial organizer proteins that control the correct assembly of the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1605287089,"Abstract Adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase from rabbit erythrocytes has been resolved into three active fractions possessing both phosphotransferase and cyclic AMP-binding activities. These enzymes are arbitrarily designated as kinases I, IIa, and IIb. The kinetic properties and substrate specificities of these kinases are remarkably similar. All three variants catalyze the phosphorylation of calf thymus histones and are stimulated by low concentrations of cyclic AMP. The molecular weights of these enzymes have been estimated by gel filtration to be 170,000, 120,000, and 240,000, corresponding to kinases I, IIa, and IIb, respectively. The three kinases differ in temperature (53°) stability. Kinases IIa and IIb are inactivated more slowly than kinase I. However, the rate of inactivation of kinase I is greatly diminished in the presence of both ATP and Mg2+. A similar protection by these compounds is not observed with kinases IIa and IIb. Each of these kinases appears to be constructed of two dissimilar functional subunits: a catalytic subunit and a regulatory subunit. Cyclic AMP causes the two dissimilar functional subunits to dissociate by binding to the regulatory moiety. A similar activation may be accomplished by protamine. In addition, protamine enhances the binding of cyclic AMP to the kinases as determined by the Millipore filtration assay. The regulatory moiety of kinase I cross-reacts with the catalytic moiety of both kinases IIa and IIb."
https://openalex.org/W1612768230,"Abstract Substrate cycling of fructose 6-phosphate through reactions catalyzed by phosphofructokinase and fructose 1,6-diphosphatase was estimated in rat liver in vivo. The rate of phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate was determined by measuring the release of tritium to intrahepatic water following the metabolism of intraperitoneally injected [5-3H, U-14C]glucose. For net flux of hepatic glucose metabolism in the direction of glucose formation the rate of fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation is effectively equal to the rate of substrate cycling. In contrast, when the net flux of glucose metabolism is in the direction of glycolysis, then substrate cycling is a fraction of the rate of fructose 6-phosphate phosphorylation. This fraction is related to the decrease in the 3H:14C ratio in hexose 6-phosphate. For either the fed or the 25-day-old rat that had been fasted for 24 hours or for the 2-day-old suckling rat a net synthesis of glucose from [U-14C]lactate is always observed. At physiological levels of lactate (2 µmoles per g body weight) the net rate of gluconeogenesis is 0.22 µmole x min-1 x g-1 (wet weight of liver) for either the suckling or fasted rat. In the fed rat, the net rate of gluconeogenesis is only 0.06 µmole x min-1 x g-1. These rates represent only a fraction of the maximal observed gluconeogenic capacity of liver since gluconeogenesis is proportional to the amount of lactate injected. Maximal rates of gluconeogenesis are achieved at a lactate concentration of 20 µmoles per g body weight. In contrast to these observations, a number of nonphysiological conditions (injection of hypoglycemic agents, anoxia, low temperature) can be used to produce a net rate of glycolysis in liver. The data from a variety of situation indicate that for the liver in vivo the rate of phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate is inversely proportional to the rate of dephosphorylation of fructose 1,6-diphosphate. In accord with this relationship the rate of cycling of fructose 6-phosphate is maximal (approximately 0.2 µmole x min-1 x g-1 wet weight of liver) when carbon flux is low and decreases when either glycolytic or gluconeogenic rates increase. It is concluded that this cyclic reaction may provide a means for the fine regulation of glucose metabolism in liver. The contribution of substrate cycling of fructose 6-phosphate to the energy cost of hepatic gluconeogenesis under normal conditions is considered to be minor."
https://openalex.org/W2092126774,"Daily intraperitoneal injection of cadmium chloride (1 milligram per kilogram) for 45 days enhanced gluconeogenesis as evidenced by significant increases in the activities of liver and kidney cortex pyruvate carboxylase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase, hexosediphosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphatase, the quartet of key, rate-limiting enzymes involved in the biotransformation of noncarbohydrate precursors into glucose. Whereas cadmium treatment decreased the level of hepatic glycogen, the concentration of blood glucose and urea was significantly elevated by this heavy metal. Discontinuation of the heavy metal treatment for 28 days, in rats previously injected with cadmium for 45 days, failed to restore the observed biochemical alterations in hepatic and renal carbohydrate metabolism to control values. Evidence indicates that cadmium augments the glucose-synthesizing capacity of liver and kidney cortex and that various metabolic changes persist even after a 4-week period of withdrawal from exposure to the heavy metal."
https://openalex.org/W1579115437,"Abstract Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetase has been purified extensively from rat liver. Gel filtration studies indicate that the enzyme is a complex of large molecular weight. On electron microscopy, stacking of enzyme molecules into long, linear aggregates is observed. The subunit molecular weight is 40,500, as measured by disc gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. MgATP appears to be the required form of ATP as substrate, and excess free Mg2+ stimulates the reaction at low MgATP concentrations. The enzyme is highly specific for ribose 5-phosphate, and substrate inhibition occurs at ribose 5-phosphate concentrations above 1.5 mm. Like phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate synthetases from other sources, the rat liver enzyme requires inorganic phosphate for catalytic activity, but is not inactivated by dialysis against phosphate-free buffer. In the presence of optimal levels of phosphate and free Mg2+, the apparent Km is 0.22 mm for MgATP and 0.29 mm for ribose 5-phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1540697397,"Abstract The appearance of the downfield region of the PMR spectrum of apocytochrome c is consistent with that of an extensively disordered protein. The resonances of the three histidine C-2 protons are almost equivalent and have a pKa of 6.2. In contrast, this region of the ferricytochrome c PMR spectrum shows many sharp resonances, due to the tertiary structure of the protein and contact shifts from the heme group. The complete titration of one histidine residue, with a pKa of 6.41, can be determined in the holoprotein. At low pH, the resonance of a second histidine residue can be observed. The acid-induced conformational transition of ferricytochrome c can be resolved into several component transitions by the use of different spectral parameters. Measurements of absorption at 395 nm and fluorescence emission at 340 nm show a single cooperative transition with midpoint of about pH 2.5. These indices are closely related to the geometry of the heme group. The resonances of the two observable histidine residues change in a way suggesting denaturation only below pH 1.8 but indicate conformational changes at about pH 3. The resonances assigned to heme methyl groups, however, undergo significant changes between pH 3 and 4. The reduced viscosity of acid-denatured ferricytochrome c and the fluorescence emission of its tryptophan residue increase markedly as salt concentration is lowered, indicating that the conformation of the acid denatured protein is sensitive to ionic strength."

https://openalex.org/W1503472128,"Abstract Plasma membranes isolated from bovine anterior pituitary gland are self-phosphorylated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP by an endogenous protein kinase. Eighty per cent of protein kinase activity is solubilized by treatment of the plasma membranes with 1.0 n NH4Cl or 0.5% Triton X-100. The presence of latent protein kinase activity is shown by an approximately 50% increase of total enzymatic activity upon addition of the detergent. The enzyme associated with the plasma membrane is Mg2+-dependent and its activity is inhibited by Ca2+ at all concentrations studied. [32P]Phosphate is incorporated into phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Only 13% of the incorporated 32P can be removed by washing the membranes in a high salt solution (0.5 m KCl). As resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at pH 7.1, adenohypophyseal plasma membranes show a consistent pattern of 36 bands, of which 11 act as substrate for protein kinase. Cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate leads to a 40 to 100% increased incorporation of 32P into nine bands. Changes of the level of phosphorylation of components of the plasma membranes and of the membranes of the secretory granules could lead to altered rates of membrane fusion-fission processes accompanying exocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1542583664,"Abstract A respiration-deficient nuclear mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae was isolated that lacked mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase (F1). The absence of this enzyme was established by adenosine triphosphatase assays, by antibody-binding studies, and by radioimmunochemical tests for F1 subunits. The mutant also lacked mitochondrial 32Pi-ATP exchange activity and exhibited greatly reduced amounts of cytochromes aa3, b, and c1. It possessed a mitochondrial protein-synthesizing system, but several products of this system were either abnormal or missing. Thus, the level of the three mitochondrially synthesized subunits of cytochrome c oxidase was at least 10 times lower than in the wild type. The mutant was unable to grow anaerobically even if the growth medium contained a fermentable substrate and unsaturated lipids. This property has not yet been reported for any S. cerevisiae strain. The mutant had a great tendency to lose its mitochondrial genome. The conversion to the double mutant state decreased the growth rate by a factor of 20 to 30. These results suggest that mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase has an essential function even in nonrespiring cells. The mutant described here offers new possibilities for studying the assembly of F1 from its subunits and the role of F1 in mitochondrial biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1542816267,"Abstract We observed the nonenzymatic formation of guanosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) from GTP. The reaction was dependent upon heat and was accelerated by divalent cations and creatine phosphate. The formation of cyclic GMP was greater with increased incubation time, temperature, GTP concentration, and pH. All of the divalent cations tested (Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, and Zn2+) increased cyclic GMP formation. The Stimulatory effect of all of the cations tested, except Zn2+, was increased with creatine phosphate. Cyclic GMP formed was determined with two different assay methods and characterized with cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase treatment and two different chromatographic systems. It is concluded from our studies that significant amounts of cyclic GMP can be formed nonenzymatically from GTP when guanylate cyclase reaction mixtures are heated at a pH near neutrality."
https://openalex.org/W1606277661,"Abstract The hypothesis that 2-carboxy-3-ketoribitol-1,5-diphosphate (3-keto-CRDP) is an intermediate in the enzymatic carboxylation of ribulose 1,5-diphosphate is supported by the finding that 2-carboxyribitol-1,5-diphosphate (CRDP), a structural analogue of 3-keto-CRDP, is a potent inhibitor of ribulose diphosphate carboxylase (Siegel, M. I., and Lane M. D., (1972) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 48, 508). The present investigation shows that 3-keto-CRDP, prepared chemically from CRDP, undergoes nonenzymatic, as well as enzymatic, cleavage to yield 2 molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate. Catalytic oxidation (100% oxygen, platinum on carbon catalyst, 0°) of 2-[14C]carboxyribitol-1,5-diphosphate in 10 mm MgCl2 gives rise to the predicted 3-keto and 4-keto derivatives which were characterized by reduction with [3H]NaBH4 and periodate degradation. Divalent magnesium ion which binds stoichiometrically to CRDP and alters its NMR spectrum is absolutely required for this catalytic oxidation at 0°. One of the oxidation products, 2-[14C]carboxy-3-ketoribitol-1,5-diphosphate—the proposed intermediate in the enzymatic carboxylation reaction—is an unstable β-keto acid and decarboxylates spontaneously to 14CO2 and a pentose diphosphate. Chemically synthesized 2-[14C]carboxy-3-ketoribitol-1,5-diphosphate also undergoes spontaneous hydrolytic cleavage at 25° and pH 9, giving rise to 1 molecule of d-3-phosphoglycerate and 1 molecule of l-3-phosphoglycerate, the unlabeled d isomer arising from carbon atoms 3, 4, and 5 and the 14C-labeled l-isomer from the carboxyl group and carbon atoms 1 and 2 of 2-[14C]carboxy-3-ketoribitol-1,5-diphosphate. The hypothesis that 3-keto-CRDP is an intermediate in the enzymatic carboxylation of d-ribulose 1,5-diphosphate is substantiated by the finding that chemically synthesized 3-keto-CRDP is cleaved by ribulose diphosphate carboxylase giving rise to 3-phosphoglycerate of unknown absolute configuration. Since enzymatic carboxylation leads to the formation of 2 molecules of d-3-phosphoglycerate, it is suggested that the carboxylase directs the stereochemistry of cleavage of 3-keto-CRDP."

Inhibition and periodate oxidation studies implicate the carbohydrate moiety of the chick skin α1-CB5 glycopeptide as one of its structural determinants. Evidence is also presented that native, triple helical collagen (tropocollagen) possesses an independent plateletaggregating activity in which its carbohydrate moiety is not involved. The quaternary structure of collagen fibrils appears to possess a third independent platelet-aggregating activity for which the carbohydrate moiety seems to be required."
https://openalex.org/W1537380162,"Abstract Plasma membranes were purified from bovine anterior pituitary tissue by differential and isopycnic centrifugation according to a modification of Neville's technique (Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 8, 413, 1960). Plasma membranes, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and secretory granules sedimented at the interfaces of sucrose layers of different densities and were thus simultaneously obtained in high yield by this technique. The yields of these different fractions were, respectively, 1, 2.5, and 10 mg per g of original pituitary tissue. As shown by electron microscopy, the plasma membrane fraction was not contaminated by other identifiable subcellular components. Growth hormone and prolactin accounted for, respectively, 10 to 30% and 60 to 80% of the total proteins of secretory granules. There was a 7- to 14-fold enrichment of Mg2+-dependent-(Na+-K+)-stimulated ATPase and 5'-nucleotidase activities in the plasma membrane fraction relative to the total homogenate. Adenylate cyclase activity was approximately 10-fold higher in the plasma membrane fraction than in the original homogenate. NaF, 10 mm, gave a 4- to 10-fold stimulation of enzymatic activity in all fractions. Maximal activation of plasma membrane adenylate cyclase activity by Mg2+ and Mn2+ was observed, respectively, at concentrations of 3.5 and 2 mm. Ca2+ inhibited cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate formation at all concentrations studied."
https://openalex.org/W1553906730,"Abstract The sequence of 23 nucleotides beyond the C-C-A end of the Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA gene has been determined. The previously deduced (Loewen, P. C., and Khorana, H. G. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3489) sequence of the first 12 nucleotides (T-C-A-A-C-T-T-T-C-A-A-A) has been revised to T-C-A-C-T-T-T-C-A-A-A-A. The sequence of the next 11 nucleotides is G-T-C-C-C-T-G-A-A-C-T. The general approach used in the sequence work was the DNA polymerase-I-catalyzed elongation of suitable deoxyribopolynucleotides which served as primers when hybridized to the r-strand of φ80psuiii DNA. Five methods were used in the sequential analysis of the elongated primers: (a) the use of a restricted number of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates; (b) timed incorporation of all of the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates and isolation of the pure radioactive products by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (c) isolation of the products from timed incorporation of the dNTPs in which CTP replaced dCTP and Mn2+ replaced Mg2+; (d) separation of the fragments formed after alkaline hydrolysis by two-dimensional electrophoresis; (e) derivation of the nucleotide sequence after partial stepwise degradation by spleen and venom phosphodiesterases by two-dimensional finger-printing methods of Sanger and co-workers (Sanger, F., Donelson, J. E., Coulson, A. R., Kossel, H., and Fischer, D. (1973) Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 70, 1209)."
https://openalex.org/W1558844889,"Abstract The non-histone chromatin phosphoprotein fraction isolated from beef liver nuclei contains endogenous protein kinase activity which catalyzes the phosphorylation of these proteins in vitro in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and magnesium. By using phosphocellulose chromatography we have separated this protein kinase activity into 12 distinct enzyme fractions. Individual enzyme fractions can be resolved further by acrylamide gel electrophoresis into multiple components, thus demonstrating an extraordinary degree of heterogeneity among the chromatin-associated protein kinases. Protein kinase fractions exhibit different specificities for casein, histone, and non-histone proteins as substrates, as demonstrated by both acid-precipitable radioactivity and analysis of radioactivity patterns of 32P-labeled substrates by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further evidence to suggest that we are dealing with a number of different protein kinases is presented by the specific effects on substrate phosphorylation which we observe in the presence of cyclic adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP). This cyclic nucleotide exhibits either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on protein phosphorylation, depending on both the substrate and the protein kinase fraction employed. A comparison of one of the nuclear protein kinase fractions with cytoplasmic histone kinase illustrates that these are different enzymes. Although both enzymes are able to catalyze the phosphorylation of non-histone chromatin proteins and f1 histone, the pattern of labeling is found to be quite different when analyzed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cyclic AMP stimulates the phosphorylation of non-histone protein by both of these enzymes. However, the phosphorylation of f1 histone is stimulated by cyclic AMP when histone kinase is used but is inhibited by cyclic AMP with this particular nuclear protein kinase fraction, again demonstrating that these are distinctly different enzymes. On the basis of our results, we conclude that the protein kinases which are associated with the non-histone chromatin phosphorylated proteins of the nucleus can be fractionated into a large number of enzyme activities which have distinct substrate specificities and responses to cyclic AMP. Preliminary data showing the existence of different protein kinase profiles in liver and kidney emphasize the tissue specificity of these enzymes and suggest that these kinases may play an important role in the tissue-specific regulation of RNA synthesis and chromatin function."

https://openalex.org/W1605534181,"Abstract The control of total δ-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) synthetase activity in mammalian liver has been studied in isolated rat liver cell suspensions. Induction of ALA synthetase by the drug, allylisopropyl-acetamide (AIA) at a rate comparable to that of drug-stimulated induction in fasted rats could be achieved in the isolated cells; induction was largely dependent on the presence of adenosine 3' : 5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) or its dibutyryl derivative. At optimal concentrations either AIA (1.2 mm) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (50 µm) alone caused little induction, but in combination caused a 4- to 5-fold increase of ALA synthetase activity in isolated cells over a 6-hour period. It is suggested that the cyclic AMP dependence of induction by drugs, also demonstrated for the drug 3,5-dicarbethoxydihydrocollidine, explains glucose repression of ALA synthetase observed in vivo. Glucose had no effect on induction by AIA ± dibutyryl cyclic AMP in isolated cells. Despite reports that glucocorticoids are required for induction in vivo, addition of hydrocortisone succinate to concentrations maximally effective in inducing hepatic tyrosine aminotransferase had little effect on the increase in total ALA synthetase activity stimulated by AIA ± dibutyryl cyclic AMP in isolated cells. Induction was prevented by addition of cycloheximide or actinomycin D to cell suspensions."
https://openalex.org/W1675163865,"Abstract Jejunum and ileum from vitamin D-deficient rats actively secreted calcium when studied in vitro, while duodenum from these animals actively absorbed calcium. Acute repletion with a single physiologic dose of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25-OH D3) (15 i.u.) increased calcium absorption in duodenum and ileum but had no effect on jejunum. Studies of the distribution of 25-OH D3 and its metabolites in these tissues demonstrated that levels of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 per cell were highest in duodenum, much lower in ileum and lower still in jejunum. The increased calcium absorption in duodenum and ileum was proportional to the levels of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 in these tissues. This was not the case for jejunum however, because while 1,25-(OH)2 D3 was present, calcium transport rates were unchanged. Another finding was a much higher percentage of water-soluble metabolites of 25-OH D3 in jejunum and ileum than in duodenum. This observation may relate to an enterohepatic circulation of these compounds. These experiments suggest that previous reports of decreased calcium absorptive responses by lower small bowel (relative to proximal duodenum) to either treatment with vitamin D or prolonged dietary calcium deprivation, can be explained by the differential cellular localization of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 (duodenum g ileum g jejunum)."

Release of lysosomal enzymes is inhibited by epinephrine and adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), but not by phenylephrine or adenosine 5'-monophosphate. Inhibition of enzyme release by epinephrine may be mediated by cyclic AMP because the cyclic AMP in the neutrophils is increased by epinephrine treatment at the time when enzyme release is reduced."

https://openalex.org/W1487712918,"Abstract A solubilized preparation of myocardial adenylate cyclase was chromatographed on Sephadex G-100. Binding of 125I-glucagon and fluoride-stimulatable adenylate cyclase activity occurred in the elution fractions excluded from the gel suggesting a molecular weight greater than 100,000 for the enzyme-receptor site complex. Prior incubation of the binding peak with glucagon shifted its elution pattern on Sephadex G-100 to a smaller molecular weight peak of approximately 20,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The findings are consistent with a dissociable receptor site for glucagon on myocardial adenylate cyclase and may provide a mechanism for activation-inactivation of the enzyme following hormone binding."

Enzyme containing bound DPNH and to a lesser extent ADP-ribose, or 3-pyridine aldehyde-DPN forms very tight ternary complexes with UDP-galactose, but enzyme containing 3-acetylpyridine-DPN or thionicotinamide-DPN does not bind substrate tightly. In a normal catalytic cycle, DPN only dissociates once in every 9,000 catalytic events. Evidence has been obtained suggesting multiple conformation of the enzyme, induced by different coenzyme analogues, but only DPN induces a conformation which results in enzyme activity."
https://openalex.org/W1577510800,"Abstract The spectral properties of tyrosyl side chains were investigated in chicken ovomucoid and derivatives produced by acetylating with N-acetylimidazole. Cooling ovomucoid to 77°K brings out the tyrosyl fine structure. Absorption spectra at 77°K reveal 2 different kinds of tyrosyl sites. About 4 tyrosyls have their longest wavelength absorption band at 284 nm and are relatively well shielded from the solvent. Approximately 2 tyrosyls, having their longest wavelength band near 282 nm, may be exposed to the solvent. These 2 tyrosyls are most easily O-acetylated. Among the 4 tyrosyls that are shielded from the solvent, 2 are especially difficult to acetylate. These 2 tyrosyls are O-acetylated only in the presence of 7 m guanidine hydrochloride. Completely acetylating all 6 tyrosyls in ovomucoid revealed that their molar absorptivity is about 20% greater than that of tyrosyls dissolved in water. If this hyperchromism is not taken into account, the number of acetylated tyrosyls calculated from spectral data will be inaccurate. Both acetylation experiments and 77°K spectra indicated that the near ultraviolet CD spectrum of native ovomucoid is contributed by tyrosyl, cystinyl, and phenylalanyl side chains. Positive tyrosyl CD bands at 284 and 277 nm are superimposed upon a broad, intense negative disulfide CD band. Acetylating the first 2 tyrosyls intensifies the tyrosyl CD fine structure by 25%. The tyrosyl CD bands disappear as the last 3 tyrosyls are acetylated and reappear upon deacetylating the O-acetyltyrosyls with hydroxylamine. The intense disulfide CD band with a maximum near 265 nm is not much affected by acetylating ovomucoid. Cooling the native protein to 77°K increases the disulfide rotatory strength about 30%. Reducing native ovomucoid with dithiothreitol abolishes both the disulfide and the tyrosyl CD bands."
https://openalex.org/W1606613970,"Abstract The data presented with the isolated adrenal cells in the present study show that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulates the synthesis of pregnenolone from (20S)-20-hydroxycholesterol which is cycloheximide-insensitive. The stimulatory effect of the hormone is not eliminated by preloading the cells with (20S)-20-hydroxycholesterol. Furthermore, adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate does not mimic this stimulatory action of ACTH. Previous studies from other laboratories (which have been supported from this laboratory) have shown that the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone is inhibited by cycloheximide. The transformation of cholesterol to (20S)-20-hydroxycholesterol has been shown to be the rate-limiting step and this step has been implicated to be inhibited by cycloheximide. It is, therefore, concluded from the present study that ACTH stimulates this step as well as the second step which is the conversion of (20S)-20-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone. This second step has been herein shown to be cycloheximide-insensitive. The latter effect of ACTH is not mediated by adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate. It is, further, proposed that the mode of action of ACTH in the isolated adrenal cell is both dependent and independent of adenosine cyclic 3':5'-monophosphate. Another observation in the present study is that exogenous cholesterol inhibits ACTH-stimulated steroidogenesis. Of further significance is the finding that high concentrations of deoxycorticosterone are formed from (20S)-20-hydroxycholesterol in the cell. This suggests that in this biosynthetic pathway, the last step, which is the conversion of deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone, is a relatively slow reaction. This latter step, however, may not be under the control of ACTH."
https://openalex.org/W1540179161,"Abstract The preferential hydrations of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of yeast and its (NAD)4 complex have been calculated from buoyant densities measured by an isopycnic sedimentation method in a concentration series of potassium phosphate solutions and by sedimentation equilibrium in cesium chloride gradients. In potassium phosphate solution at the isopycnic concentration and pH 7.4 and 25°, the preferential hydration of the apoenzyme is 0.480 g of water per g of protein. There is a 15.7% decrease in preferential hydration when the NAD complex is formed. This corresponds to a 6.3% decrease in volume of the solvated protein and is in accord with a reported 7% volume contraction measured by x-ray small angle scattering. The buoyant density increase associated with NAD complex formation is attributed to the elimination of water from cavities in the contracting protein structure that exclude the salt component of the solvent. Essentially the same hydration change occurs at pH 8.5, where the protein binds NAD with a high degree of positive cooperativity, and at pH 7.4, where the binding appears to occur at noninteracting sites. Chloride binding to the apo- and holoenzymes has been estimated from the pH shift that occurs when cesium chloride at its isopycnic concentration is added to a solution of the isoionic protein. The buoyant density increase associated with NAD complex formation does not involve an increased binding of salt, the heavy component of the solvent."
https://openalex.org/W1566335920,"Abstract The distribution of polypyrimidine sequences has been studied in 28 S rRNA from Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells. Oligonucleotides were released from 32P-labeled RNA by successive digestion with U2 RNase followed by T1 RNase. The various fragments were initially separated by chromatography according to chain length on DEAE-Sephadex A-25 at pH 7.5. The fragments in each isostich were further separated according to base composition by electrophoresis on cellulose acetate strips or Whatman No. 3MM paper at pH 3.5. On the basis of electrophoretic mobility and nucleotide composition, 118 fragments were found with chain lengths of 5 to 21, including 55 pentanucleotides, 26 hexanucleotides, 11 heptanucleotides, 8 octanucleotides, 5 nonanucleotides, 3 decanucleotides, 2 undecanucleotides, 1 dodecanucleotide, 2 tridecanucleotides, 1 tetradecanucleotide, 2 pentadecanucleotides, 1 hexadecanucleotide, and 1 unicosanucleotide. The sequences of 94 of these containing 667 nucleotides are presented, the largest being an unicosanucleotide (U-U-C-C-C-C-C-C-U-C-U-C-C-U-C-U-U-C-C-C-Gp). On the basis of electrophoretic mobility and nucleotide composition, 24 of the fragments of chain length 6 or greater are specific markers for 28 S rRNA and not present in 18 S rRNA. Furthermore, only 8 of the 62 deduced sequences of chain length 6 or greater are common to 18 S rRNA. Eight alkali-stable markers in 28 S rRNA were isolated in polypyrimidine oligonucleotides including a trinucleotide, Um-Gm-Up, and a tetranucleotide, Am-Gm-Cm-Ap. The molar yields of the marker and other fragments and the lack of contamination with marker fragments of 18 S rRNA are consistent with a high degree of homogeneity of mammalian 28 S rRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1491204980,"Plasma membranes, isolated from uninfected cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts, were dissociated with sodium dodecyl sulfate and analyzed for glycoprotein and protein subunit composition by discontinuous gel electrophoresis. More than 30 protein subunits and 18 glycoprotein subunits were obtained from the A′ and B′ plasma membrane fractions; the membranes in the A′ fraction contain almost twice as much phospholipid and cholesterol as those of the B′ fraction and have a density of 1.06 versus 1.12. Electrophoretic separation profiles were similar for both types of membranes. The molecular weights of the components range from more than 220,000 to less than 22,500. Major protein subunits had molecular weights of 175,000, 95,000 75,000, 69,000, 56,000, 47,000 35,000, and 32,000. The majority of the glycoprotein subunits migrated with protein subunits of more than 70,000 molecular weight. No estimation of molecular weights was attempted for these components. Iodination of whole cells yielded A′ and B′ membrane fractions, which were differentially labeled, with five and seven peaks of radioactivity, respectively. Some degree of differentiation between A′ and B′ fractions was also obtained when cells were prelabeled with radioactive glucosamine and mannosamine. A′ membrane fractions, known to contain more lipid than B′ membrane, also showed a greater recovery of isotope in the lipid region of the gel than did B′ membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1529783557,"Abstract NAD+-specific glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.12) from pea seeds is shown to catalyze the arsenolysis of 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid. The reaction shows an absolute requirement for NAD+ or analogs which will replace NAD+ in the enzyme-catalyzed oxidative phosphorylation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. NADH, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, or NAD+ analogs which are inhibitory or inactive in the oxidative phosphorylation reaction, are unable to stimulate arsenolysis. NAD+ is also required for the reductive dephosphorylation of 1,3-diphosphoglyceric acid by NADH. The specificity and kinetics of the effect of NAD+ in the arsenolysis reaction are consistent with the kinetic mechanism previously proposed (Duggleby, R. G., and Dennis, D. T. (1974) J. Biol Chem. 249, 167–174). In view of the similarity between the enzyme from pea seeds and that from other sources, it is suggested that this mechanism may operate in the enzyme from other sources. The mechanism is capable of providing a simple explanation for a number of the catalytic properties which have been reported for the enzyme from other sources."
https://openalex.org/W2143834288,"Abstract Coproporphyrin III was isolated from aerobically and anaerobically grown yeast and from the medium of anaerobic cultures, and was identified as the compound responsible for the inhibition of the synthesis de novo of apocytochrome oxidase in yeast protoplasts. Authentic coproporphyrin III gives identical results. The intracellular concentration of coproporphyrin above which all synthesis of the oxidase ceases is 0.26 ± 0.013 µm. The coproporphyrin concentration in anaerobic and aerobic yeast is 0.4 and 0.15 µm, respectively. The inhibitory action of coproporphyrin is observed only when the yeast protoplasts are incubated anaerobically. Oxygen prevents and reverses this inhibition. With the aid of cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, and acriflavin it was shown that coproporphyrin inhibits mitochondrial transcriptional, but not translational, events involved in the synthesis of cytochrome oxidase, as well as the synthesis of the polypeptides translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes. Coproporphyrin has no effect on the assembly of the holoenzyme from its polypeptides and heme a. It is concluded that oxygen regulates the synthesis of cytochrome oxidase by acting as cosubstrate in heme a synthesis and by abolishing the inhibition by coproporphyrin of the synthesis of apocytochrome oxidase."

With the judicious use of cycloheximide, chloramphenicol, and acriflavin, it was possible to show that the anaerobic elaboration of the oxidase involves synthesis de novo of polypeptides of the oxidase which are translated on cytoplasmic and mitochondrial ribosomes, as well as the operation of mitochondrial transcription, suggesting the need for synthesis of mitochondrial messenger RNA. Under certain conditions the cytoplasmic and the mitochondrial protein-synthesizing systems can be uncoupled leading to accumulation of cytoplasmic or mitochondrial components of cytochrome oxidase.

https://openalex.org/W1528320183,"Abstract The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase of yeast is known to undergo a particle volume contraction and the commensurate loss of a hydration component when it forms a complex with NAD. We have inquired whether the water movement in the conformational transition can be monitored by measurements of the spin lattice relaxation rate, T1-1 of solvent water protons. In solutions of diamagnetic proteins, a class of bound water molecules is rapidly relaxed in the protein hydration domain and the relaxation is averaged in the bulk solvent by water exchange. T1-1 was found by pulse NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) measurements to increase as a linear function of the apoprotein concentration. From measurements at two frequencies, the correlation time was calculated to be in the range expected from the rotational diffusion relaxation time of the protein. The minimal number of exchangeable bound water molecules required to account for the apoprotein effect is 26 per protein subunit, a small fraction of the total hydration of the protein. NAD complex formation produces a further increase in the relaxation rate of the solvent water protons. Increments of T1-1 as a function of NAD concentration follow the course of a binding isotherm with a stoichiometry of 1 mole of NAD per mole of protein subunit. The direction of the NAD effect corresponds to an increase in the class of bound water molecules that contribute to the relaxation rate increase. Hence, different classes of bound water are represented by the T1-1 effect and by the larger amount of water eliminated in the conformational transition. The latter water is loosely bound or trapped in cavities of the protein structure, and differences in its proton relaxation rate, in and out of the hydration domain, are not detected by NMR in the frequency range examined. The number of specifically bound water molecules involved in the T1-1 effect of NAD is estimated to be small enough to be accounted for by local effects at the binding sites."

Upon placing the epimerase-[4-β-3H]DPNH · UDP-hexose complex in the presence of 0.4 m cyclohexanone about 70% of the DPNH is reoxidized and about 40% of the catalytic activity is restored within 90 min at 27° and pH 8.5, while the major radioactive products are 3H2O and free tritiated DPN+, as well as enzyme-bound tritiated DPN+, but not tritiated cyclohexanol. There is no evidence that cyclohexanone is reduced, and cyclohexanol at similar concentrations causes a similar reactivation. It is probable that these compounds act by causing the tightly bound UDP-hexose molecules to be released from the reduced complex. The resultant epimerase · DPNH complex then undergoes spontaneous autoxidation and reactivation."
