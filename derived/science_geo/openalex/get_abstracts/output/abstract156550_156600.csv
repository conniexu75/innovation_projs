https://openalex.org/W1936630560,"Almost all aphid species (Homoptera, Insecta) have 60-80 huge cells called bacteriocytes, within which are round-shaped bacteria that are designated Buchnera. These bacteria are maternally transmitted to eggs and embryos through host generations, and the mutualism between the host and the bacteria is so obligate that neither can reproduce independently. Buchnera is a close relative of Escherichia coli, but it contains more than 100 genomic copies per cell, and its genome size is only a seventh of that of E. coli. Here we report the complete genome sequence of Buchnera sp. strain APS, which is composed of one 640,681-base-pair chromosome and two small plasmids. There are genes for the biosyntheses of amino acids essential for the hosts in the genome, but those for non-essential amino acids are missing, indicating complementarity and syntrophy between the host and the symbiont. In addition, Buchnera lacks genes for the biosynthesis of cell-surface components, including lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids, regulator genes and genes involved in defence of the cell. These results indicate that Buchnera is completely symbiotic and viable only in its limited niche, the bacteriocyte."

https://openalex.org/W2415829945,"If a helpless newborn infant does not form an attachment to its care-giver, even an abusive one, its chances of survival diminish, so evolution should strongly favour attachment by the infant, regardless of the quality of care-giving1. As a part of the brain called the amygdala is critical for learned fear in adult animals2,3,4, we investigated whether the development of learned avoidance behaviour could be delayed by late maturation of amygdala function. We found that very young rat pups exposed to various odours associated with shock treatment learn an approach response to that odour, whereas older pups learn odour avoidance. We show that the origin and development of learned odour-avoidance behaviour is associated with enhanced neural responses in the amygdala during odour-shock conditioning."

https://openalex.org/W1539848557,"As first pointed out by Bardeen and Ginzburg in the early sixties, the amount of magnetic flux carried by vortices in superconducting materials depends on their distance from the sample edge, and can be smaller than one flux quantum, phi0 = h/2e (where h is Planck's constant and e is the electronic charge). In bulk superconductors, this reduction of flux becomes negligible at submicrometre distances from the edge, but in thin films the effect may survive much farther into the material. But the effect has not been observed experimentally, and it is often assumed that magnetic field enters type II superconductors in units of phi0. Here we measure the amount of flux introduced by individual vortices in a superconducting film, finding that the flux always differs substantially from phi0. We have observed vortices that carry as little as 0.001phi0, as well as 'negative vortices', whose penetration leads to the expulsion of magnetic field. We distinguish two phenomena responsible for non-quantized flux penetration: the finite-size effect and a nonlinear screening of the magnetic field due to the presence of a surface barrier. The latter effect has not been considered previously, but is likely to cause non-quantized penetration in most cases."

We show here the primary structure, tissue distribution, and functional characterization of Na+-drivenchloride/bicarbonate exchanger (designated NCBE ) cloned from the insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 cDNA library. The NCBE protein consists of 1088 amino acids having 74, 72, and 55% amino acid identity to the human skeletal muscle, rat smooth muscle, and human kidney sodium bicarbonate cotransporter, respectively. The protein has 10 putative membrane-spanning regions. NCBE mRNA is expressed at high levels in the brain and the mouse insulinoma cell line MIN6 and at low levels in the pituitary, testis, kidney, and ileum. Functional analyses of the NCBE protein expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes and HEK293 cells demonstrate that it transports extracellular Na+ and HCO3− into cells in exchange for intracellular Cl− and H+, thus raising the intracellular pH. Thus, we conclude that NCBE is a Na+-driven Cl−/HC O3−exchanger that regulates intracellular pH in native cells.

The Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger was first discovered in invertebrate neurons (11Russell J.M Boron W.F.

In pancreatic islet β-cells, glucose is physiologically the most important regulator of insulin secretion. It has been shown that glucose metabolism induces an increase in pHi in pancreatic β-cells (17Lindström P. Sehlin J. Biochem.

Tarvin J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 73: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine the structure and functional roles of the Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, we attempted to clone the Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger from the mouse insulin-secreting cell line, MIN6. We describe here the primary structure, tissue distribution, and functional properties of a Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, designated NCBE. A partial cDNA fragment of human kidney NBC cDNA (7Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol.

The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-TTTGGAGAAAACCCCTGGT-3′ (nt 2232–2250) and 5′-TGACATCATCCAGGAAGCTG-3′ (nt 2912–2931). PCR was performed for 40 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation at 94 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 45 s in a thermal cycle GeneAmp PCR system 9600 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The 700-base pair PCR product was subjected to screening of a MIN6 cDNA library (22Inagaki N. Yoshida H. Mizuta M. Mizuno N. Fujiyi Y. Gonoi T. Miyazaki J. Seino S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Positive clones were subcloned in pGEM-3Z vectors (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced in both directions using an ABI PRISMTM 377 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). RNA blot analysis was performed using 10 μg of total RNA from the various tissues and cells. The RNAs were denatured with formaldehyde, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blot was probed with NCBE cDNA (nt 1–840) under the standard conditions described previously (24Wang C-Z. Namba N. Gonoi T. Inagaki N. Seino S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 220: 196-202Google Scholar). The blots were washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 1 h and then at 50 °C for 1 h before autoradiography. Total RNA was prepared with TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) from isolated mouse pancreatic islets. First-strand cDNA (10 ng) was generated using Superscript™ II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies) with random primers. PCR was performed with the Expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) using about 1 ng of template DNA in a 20-μl reaction volume under standard conditions. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-GTCATGTTAGACCAACAG-GT-3′ (nt 4283–4302) and 5′-GTTGTAATAGCGACACTC-3′ (nt 4911–4928). The product was resolved on a 1% agarose gel and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

The coding sequence of NCBE in pSD5 was linearized by digestion withFspI and in vitro transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase as described previously (24Wang C-Z. Namba N. Gonoi T. Inagaki N. Seino S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 220: 196-202Google Scholar). Defolliculated oocytes were injected with NCBE cRNA (50 nl, 0.5 μg/μl) or water and incubated in 1× MBS medium (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mm Ca (NO3)2, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, and 7.5 mm Tris, pH 7.4) for 3–5 days at 18 °C before the studies. For the study of22Na+ or 36Cl− uptake, the oocytes were preincubated for 1 h at 18 °C in solution A (ml/oocyte) and then incubated in 1.4 ml of solution A, B, or C bubbled with 1.5% CO2 or solution D or E without CO2containing 0.074 MBq of 22NaCl or H36Cl (PerkinElmer Life Science Products). A 10-μl aliquot was removed from the incubation solution for later determination of22Na+- or36Cl−-specific activity.22Na+ or 36Cl− uptake was terminated after 15 min by three washes with the respective ice-cold solutions, with the exception of solutions D and E, which were replaced with ice-cold solution F. The oocytes were then dissolved in 0.5 ml of 5% SDS, and 4.5 ml of aqueous counting scintillant (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added.22Na+ uptake for 15 min in solution A was examined next in the presence of 300 μm4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid (DIDS, Sigma), an inhibitor of anion transporters. For the study of36Cl− efflux, oocytes were preincubated in solution A with 36Cl− for 30 min for loading. The oocytes were washed three times with solution A, B, C, D, or E at 18 °C and then placed in 1.5 ml of each solution, respectively, at 18 °C for 15 min to determine 36Cl− efflux. The 36Cl− activities of the oocytes and each solution were measured. The 36Cl− efflux is presented as the percent relative to incorporated36Cl−. The 36Cl−efflux in solution A for 15 min was also examined in the presence of 300 μm DIDS. The 22Na+ and36Cl− activities were measured with a beta scintillation counter (Aloka, Tokyo). HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 cells/3.5-cm diameter dish containing CELLocate coverslips (Eppendorf) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (60.5 μg/ml) at 37 °C under a humidified condition of 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were cotransfected with 1 μg/well of the full-length NCBE cDNA in the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and 0.05 μg/well of enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) vector, pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, California), for transfection marker, using LipofectAMINE, LipofectAMINE Plus, and Opti-MEM I reagents (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GFP-expressing cells from more than 20 monolayers were studied 48–72 h after transfection. HEK293 cells were loaded with 1 μm 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(6)-carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF-AM, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h and monitored for changes in pHi (7Burnham C.E.

The pHi calibration was generated using the KCl/nigericin technique (25Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the cells were first acidified by NH4+ prepulse with 40 mm NH4Cl-containing solutions (solutions H, K, and N) for 5 min before switching to the Na+-containing respective test solutions (7Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z. Shull G.E. Soleimani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19111-19114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To examine Na+ dependence of the pHi recovery (ΔpHi) from intracellular acidification by solution H, solutions G and I were used, and to test for HCO3− dependence, solutions J, K, and L were used. To determine Cl−dependence, solutions M, N, and O (in this case, cells transfected with NCBE were preincubated in solution M for more than 1 h to decrease intracellular Cl−) were used, and the results were compared with control and NCBE-transfected cells. All solutions were bubbled with 95% O2 and 5% CO2, adjusted to pH 7.4. The osmolarity of each solution was adjusted with sucrose. The assays were carried out at 37 °C. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical significance between each experiment was determined by Student's t test. Using a partial human kidney NBC (7Burnham C.E. Amlal H. Wang Z.

The composite nucleotide sequence of 5385 base pairs contains an open reading frame following an in-frame termination signal upstream of the ATG, which encodes a protein of 1088 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 122 kDa (GenBankTM/EBI/DDBJ data bank with accession no. AB033759, available on-line as Fig. 1S). A hydropathy analysis suggests that NCBE has 10 putative membrane-spanning segments (26Heijne G.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). There are three potentialN-linked glycosylation sites in the extracellular loops between the third (TM3) and fourth (TM4) membrane-spanning region (Asn-647, Asn-657, and Asn-667). Comparison of the amino acid sequences between NCBE and other bicarbonate transporters shows that NCBE has 74, 72, 55, 49, 38, and 34% amino acid identity to human skeletal muscle NBC (9Pushkin A.

Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), respectively, indicating that NCBE represents a novel bicarbonate transporter. NCBE is also homologous to several members of a bicarbonate transporter superfamily, the functional properties of which have not yet been characterized. NCBE has 76, 74, 52, and 49% amino acid identity to an NBC-related clone from human brain (SLC4A8, GenBank™ accession no. NM004858), putative human retinal NBC (33Ishibashi K. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 24: 535-538Google Scholar), Drosophila gene product alt 1 (GenBankTMaccession no. AAF52496), and Drosophila gene product alt 2 (GenBank accession no. AAF52497), respectively. The amino acid sequence in the putative transmembrane regions is well conserved between NCBE and members of the bicarbonate transporter superfamily, whereas the intracellular amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions and a large extracellular loop between the third and fourth membrane-spanning region are rather divergent. RNA blot analysis revealed a 5.5-kilobase NCBE mRNA expressed at high levels in brain and insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 cells and expressed at low levels in the pituitary, testis, kidney, and ileum (Fig.1 a). RT-PCR analysis shows that NCBE mRNA is also expressed in pancreatic islets (Fig.1 b). We first examined the functional properties of NCBE using aXenopus oocyte system. 22Na+ and36Cl− uptake or efflux were measured 3–5 days after injection of the cRNAs or water as control. By bubbling with 1.5% CO2 or using 16 mm butyric acid without CO2 to acidify the oocytes (6Romero M.F. Hediger M.A. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 409-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), we examined the time course of 22Na+ uptake. Because oocytes injected with water showed almost no increase, but NCBE-expressing oocytes showed a linear increase in 22Na+ uptake from 5 to 45 min (data not shown), we measured the uptake at 15 min to calculate22Na+ uptake (nmol/oocyte/h). As shown in Fig.2 a, in standard solution (solution A) 22Na+ uptake in NCBE-expressing oocytes was 31.4 ± 2.1 nmol/oocyte/h (n = 21), whereas uptake in water-injected oocytes was 1.6 ± 0.3 nmol/oocyte/h (n = 22), indicating that the22Na+ uptake in NCBE-expressing oocytes was 20-fold greater than in control oocytes (p< 0.05). In contrast, the 22Na+ uptake in NCBE-expressing oocytes was almost zero (n = 10) in Na+-free solution (solution B), but it increased in an extracellular Na+ concentration-dependent manner (data not shown), indicating that the activity of NCBE depends on extracellular Na+. When oocytes were acidified with butyric acid rather than CO2 (8Chol I. Aalkjaer C. Boulpaep E.L. Boron W.F. Nature. 2000; 405: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), the22Na+ uptake in NCBE-expressing oocytes in HCO3−-containing solution (solution D) was 19 ± 2.8 nmol/oocyte/h (n = 8). Thus, acidification with butyric acid is also effective on uptake of22Na+. To determine the effect of HCO3−, we used HCO3−-free solution (solution E) with butyric acid without CO2. Under this condition,22Na+ uptake was significantly decreased (3.1 ± 0.5 nmol/oocyte/h, n = 8,p < 0.05), indicating that extracellular HCO3− is required to transport Na+ into cells. We then examined the effect of Cl− on 22Na+ uptake.22Na+ uptake in NCBE-expressing oocytes in solution C was 18.6 ± 1.6 nmol/oocyte/h (n = 16), decreased to 50% of that in standard solution, indicating that extracellular Cl− accelerates NCBE activity and that there is 22Na+ uptake even under extracellular Cl−-free conditions (also see on-line supplemental information, Table IIS). To determine whether extracellular Cl− accelerates NCBE activity and whether intracellular Cl− is exported by NCBE, we measured the uptake and efflux of 36Cl−. 36Cl−uptake was measured in NCBE-expressing oocytes or control oocytes injected with water in solution A, B, C, D, or E. Although control oocytes showed no increase in 36Cl− uptake, NCBE-expressing oocytes showed a significant increase in36Cl− uptake in all solutions except solution C (Fig. 2 b). The values were 24 ± 2.8 (n = 9), 32 ± 0.8 (n = 10), 0.44 ± 0.1 (12Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1994; 475: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), 13 ± 0.1 (n = 11), and 48 ± 1.2 nmol/oocyte/h (n = 7) in solutions A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. The increase in36Cl− uptake of NCBE-expressing oocytes in these solutions indicates that NCBE transports extracellular Cl− into the cell and that the importing activity of Cl− is significantly increased in the absence of extracellular Na+ (solution A versus solution B,p < 0.05) or HCO3−(solution D versus solution E, p < 0.05). We then measured the Cl− efflux of the NCBE-expressing oocytes (Fig. 2 c). The rate (%) of36Cl− efflux was 74.7 ± 2.8 (n = 8), 43.0 ± 2.0 (n = 9), 42.3 ± 1.3 (n = 17), 48.0 ± 4.0 (n = 8), and 17.0 ± 4.0% (n = 8) in solutions A, B, C, D, and E, respectively (solution Aversus other solutions, p < 0.05). These results indicate that: 1) 75% of intracellular36Cl− is exported out of the cell in standard solution, 2) extracellular Na+ is necessary for exporting intracellular Cl−, 3) extracellular HCO3− is essential for exporting intracellular Cl−, and 4) extracellular Cl−accelerates Na+ uptake and Cl− efflux. Because Cl− can be transported into and out of the cell when NCBE-expressing oocytes are acidified, the transporting activity appears to be bidirectional. The functional properties of NCBE under different conditions in Xenopus oocytes are summarized in Fig. 2 d. The direction of ion movement through NCBE under the physiological condition (Fig. 2 d-1) or the extracellular Cl−-free condition (Fig. 2 d-2) during the period of decrease in pHi is forward, whereas the ion movement through NCBE under the extracellular Na+-free (Fig.2 d-3) or HCO3−-free (Fig.2d-4) condition is reverse. Taken together, these findings suggest that NCBE exchanges extracellular Na+ and HCO3− with intracellular Cl− under the physiological condition, that is, in the presence of extracellular Na+, HCO3−, and Cl−, when the cells are acidified. We also examined the effect of DIDS on22Na+ uptake and 36Cl−efflux. 22Na+ uptake in NCBE-expressing oocytes in standard solution was 6.0 ± 0.7 nmol/oocyte/h (n = 14) in the presence of 300 μm DIDS, indicating that DIDS decreased 22Na+ uptake to 20% of that in solution A (Fig. 2 a). The36Cl− efflux in NCBE-expressing oocytes in solution A was 41 ± 2% (n = 9) in the presence of 300 μm DIDS. Although DIDS decreased the36Cl− efflux to 55%, the value of36Cl− efflux was at almost the same level as in solution C (Fig. 2 c). To clarify the role of NCBE in regulating pHi, pHichanges under the various conditions were measured in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with NCBE. All experiments were carried out in acidified pHi conditions with NH4 prepulse (with solutions H, K, or N). To determine whether the change in pHiis dependent on extracellular Na+, the environment of the cells was changed from Na+-free solution (solution G) to Na+-containing solution (solution I). In the presence of 1 mm 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl-amiloride (EIPA), a specific inhibitor of the Na+/H+exchanger, rapid pHi recovery (ΔpHi) was observed only in the NCBE-transfected cells (ΔpHi was 0.239 ± 0.028 in NCBE-transfected cells (n = 97) and 0.003 ± 0.015 in control (n = 70), p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 a). This pHi recovery was partially inhibited by 300 μmDIDS (ΔpHi was 0.023 ± 0.042 (n = 89),p < 0.05) (Fig. 3 a). To determine whether the change in pHi is bicarbonate-dependent, the environment of NCBE-transfected cells was changed from HCO3−-free and Na+-free solution (solution J) to HCO3−-free but Na+-containing solution (solution L) in the presence of 1 mm EIPA. No pHi recovery was detected (ΔpHi was 0.002 ± 0.014 (n = 71)) (Fig.3 b). We also examined Cl− dependence. NCBE-transfected cells were kept in Cl−-free solution (under the intracellular Cl−-depleted condition) throughout the experiments. Under this condition, the environment of the cells was changed from Na+-free (solution M) to Na+-containing solution (solution O). In the presence of 1 mm EIPA, pHi recovery was not detected (ΔpHi was 0.067 ± 0.012 (n = 95)) (Fig.3 c). These results show that pHi recovery from intracellular acidification is detected only in the presence of extracellular Na+, HCO3−, and intracellular Cl−. Functional studies of NCBE heterologously expressed inXenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells show that NCBE causes pHi recovery from acute intracellular acidification by transporting extracellular Na+ and HCO3− in exchange for intracellular Cl− in the presence of extracellular Na+, HCO3−, and Cl−. NCBE is functionally distinct from the anion exchangers (3Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1991; 53: 549-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) and the Na+-HCO3− cotransporters (9Pushkin A.

These properties are similar to those of the Na+-driven Cl−/HCO3− exchanger described in native cells (14Zeng Y. Oberdorf J.A. Florman H.M. Dev.

The functional properties of NCBE are different from those of the recently identified Drosophila NDAE1, which does not require HCO3− for transport activity (30Romero M.F. Henry D. Nelson S.

Expression of NCBE mRNA in insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 and pancreatic islets implies its physiological relevance. It has been shown that glucose-induced insulin secretion is accompanied by a rise in pHi in pancreatic islet β-cells (17Lindström P. Sehlin J. Biochem.

Tarvin J.T. J. Membr. Biol. 1983; 73: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 21Shepherd R.M. Henquin J.-C. J. Biol.

NCBE is the first pHi-regulating exchanger of which the primary structure and functional properties have been determined. NCBE most likely contributes to the pHi recovery process in pancreatic β-cells that have been acidified by glucose metabolism. NCBE mRNA also is present in the testis, although its level is low. It has been shown that pHi regulates many sperm functions including sperm capacitation (1Busa W.B. Nuccitelli R. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R409-R438PubMed Google Scholar, 2Busa W.B. Curr. Top.

Because sperm capacitation results in pHi increases that require a functional Na+, Cl−, and HCO3−-dependent acid efflux pathway (14Zeng Y. Oberdorf J.A. Florman H.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 173: 510-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), NCBE could participate in the process. NCBE mRNA is also expressed in the brain at high levels. Based on physiological studies (12Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1994; 475: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 27Shrode L.D. Putnam R.W. Glia. 1994; 12: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), NCBE may be present in hippocampal neurons and astrocytes, but its physiological significance in such cells is not known at present. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the structure and function relationships of NCBE and its physiological roles in various tissues. We thank Dr. K.

Presently, we investigate the mechanism of CIS inhibition and CIS's role in down-regulating GHR-JAK2 signaling to STAT5b in cells exposed to GH continuously. CIS is shown to inhibit GHR-JAK2 signaling by two distinct mechanisms: by a partial inhibition that is decreased at elevated STAT5b levels and may involve competition between CIS and STAT5b for common GHR cytoplasmic tail phosphotyrosine-binding sites; and by a time-dependent inhibition, not seen with SOCS-1 or SOCS-3, that involves proteasome action. Investigation of the latter mechanism revealed that GH stimulates degradation of CIS, but not SOCS-3. The proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocked this protein degradation and also blocked the inhibitory action of CIS, but not that of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3, on STAT5b signaling. Proteasome-dependent degradation of CIS, most likely in the form of a (GHR-JAK2)-CIS complex, is therefore proposed to be an important step in the time-dependent CIS inhibition mechanism. Finally, the down-regulation of GHR-JAK2 signaling to STAT5b seen in continuous GH-treated cells could be prevented by treatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or by expression of CIS-R107K, a selective, dominant-negative inhibitor of CIS activity. These findings lead us to propose that the cytokine signaling inhibitor CIS is a key mediator of the STAT5b desensitization response seen in cells and tissues exposed to GH chronically, such as adult female rat liver.

Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 55-83Google Scholar). STAT activation occurs via a GH-inducible tyrosine phosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the GHR-associated tyrosine kinase JAK2. In liver, an important GH target tissue, two closely related STAT proteins, STAT5a and STAT5b (>90% identical), bind to the tyrosine-phosphorylated GHR, enabling the STAT to undergo rapid tyrosine phosphorylation in vivo in response to physiological levels of circulating GH (3Waxman D.J. Novartis Found. Symp. 2000; 227: 61-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This, in turn, leads to dimerization and nuclear translocation of the activated STAT, which can directly bind to target gene DNA response elements and stimulate gene transcription (4Darnell J.E.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). In contrast, GH activation of STATs 1 and 3 requires high GH concentrations to proceed efficiently (5Ram P.A. Park S.H. Choi H.K. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Isaksson O. Endocr. Rev. 1985; 6: 128-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). This dependence is most striking in rodent liver, where the intermittent occurrence of strong, well defined plasma GH pulses that is characteristic of adult males stimulates transcription of a set of cytochrome P450 and other genes that is distinct from the set of genes that is transcriptionally activated by the more continuous plasma GH profile associated with adult females (3Waxman D.J.

Although GH can induce multiple SOCS/CIS mRNAs in liver and other tissues, little is known about the physiological functions of the individual SOCS/CIS proteins, including their potential role in termination of GH pulse signaling and in mediating the down-regulation of GHR-JAK2 signaling to STAT5b that occurs in vivo in tissues chronically exposed to GH, such as adult female rat liver (15Waxman D.J.

To further address the role of SOCS/CIS proteins in GH regulation, we presently investigate the GHR-dependent mechanisms through which CIS inhibits signaling to STAT5b. Our findings lead us to propose two distinct, but linked mechanisms for CIS inhibition: 1) direct competition with STAT5b for common phosphotyrosine-binding sites on the GHR cytoplasmic tail, followed by 2) proteasome-dependent degradation of CIS protein bound to the GHR-JAK2 signaling complex. We also characterize a CIS SH2 domain mutant, CIS-R107K, and extend earlier studies of its action in interleukin-2 signaling (43Aman M.J. Migone T.S. Sasaki A. Ascherman D.P. Zhu M. Soldaini E.

Finally, we use this CIS mutant in experiments that demonstrate a critical role for an endogenous, GH-inducible CIS protein in the down-regulation of STAT5b signaling that occurs in liver cells stimulated with GH continuously. pME18S expression plasmid encoding mouse STAT5b was obtained from Dr. Alice Mui (DNAX Corp., Palo Alto, CA).

COS-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection of COS-1 cells grown in 6-well tissue culture plates was carried out using FuGene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). GHR used in the transfection studies was rat GHR, unless indicated otherwise. Thirty h after addition of the DNA/FuGene 6 mixture to the cells (∼1.1–1.2 μl of FuGene 6/1 μg of total DNA), cells were stimulated with rat GH (National Hormone and Pituitary Program, NIDDK; rGH-B-14-SIAFP) at concentrations specified in the figure legends. Cells were lysed at different times, whole cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (Tropix, Inc.) and firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Normalized luciferase activity values (firefly/Renilla) were calculated to adjust for transfection efficiencies between samples. Luciferase and EMSA activity data presented are mean ± S.D. values based onn = 2 or 3 replicates and are representative of at least two or three independent sets of experiments. EMSA analyses using probe for STAT5 DNA binding activity was performed as described previously (46Gebert C.A. Park S.H. Waxman D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, whole cell lysates from transfected COS-1 cells were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blotting of SOCS/CIS proteins was performed using monoclonal antibody raised to a Myc epitope tag (c-Myc amino acids 408–439, Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc-40; 1/1000 dilution) (32Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 400-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) were seeded onto 22-mm glass coverslips in 35-mm Corning dishes containing RPCD medium with 3% fetal bovine serum (25Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Cells isolated from one confluent 100-mm dish were used to seed 15–18 coverslips at a volume of 0.25–0.3 ml/coverslip. Cells were allowed to adhere for 2 h, and then were incubated for 10 h in RPCD medium without serum. Cells were then transfected using FuGene 6 with expression plasmid encoding GFP (pEGF2-N2; CLONTECH; 250 ng), either alone or in combination with CIS (500 ng), CIS-R107K (2 μg), or SOCS-3 (250 ng). Twenty-four h after addition of the DNA/FuGene 6 mixture to the cells, the cells were stimulated with GH (500 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were then fixed with methanol for 20 min at −20 °C, blocked twice with 3% calf serum in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-STAT5b antibody (0.2 μg/ml) as described (25Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17694-17702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% calf serum, the coverslip was incubated while inverted on a parafilm strip, with 0.04 ml of secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% calf serum) in the dark for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were washed twice in 3% calf serum and once with phosphate-buffered saline and then mounted onto glass slides. Fluorescence was visualized using an Olympus BX-50 Confocal LaserScanning Microscope. Primary antibody was detected using Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG second antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) (excitation at 568 nm and detection through a 610-nm long pass filter (red channel)). Transfected cells were identified by the green fluorescence of the co-transfected GFP expression plasmid (excitation using 488 nm krypton-argon laser, with emission detected through a 530-nm band pass filter (green channel)). Image files were processed for presentation using Adobe Photoshop. Previous studies have shown CIS and SOCS-2 are partially inhibitory to GH-stimulated STAT5b activation in transfected COS-1 cells under conditions where SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 are fully inhibitory (32Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism for the partial inhibition by CIS, COS-1 cells were transfected with GHR and CIS expression plasmids in the presence of varying amounts of STAT5b expression plasmid. GH-stimulated STAT5b activation was assayed by EMSA analysis of STAT5b DNA binding activity and by measuring luciferase activity using a STAT5 response element-luciferase reporter derived from the ratntcp gene. Cells were treated with GH for 5 h, to allow for expression of the luciferase reporter. As shown in Fig. 1, partial inhibition of STAT5b EMSA activity (panel A) and ntcp-luciferase reporter activity (panel B) was seen in cells transfected with 500 ng of STAT5b expression plasmid, equivalent to the amount of STAT5b plasmid transfected in our earlier studies (32Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In cells transfected with lower amounts of STAT5b expression plasmid, resulting in correspondingly lower levels of STAT5b activity after GH stimulation (panel A, top, lanes 2–9), CIS exerted a more complete inhibition of STAT5b EMSA activity (panel A) and luciferase reporter activity (panel B). A similar STAT5b dependence of CIS inhibitory activity was seen when STAT5b EMSA activity was monitored in cells treated with GH for 30 min (data not shown). Given that STAT5b (47Hansen J.A.

In contrast, the inhibitory effect of SOCS-3 was essentially complete over a broad STAT5b range (Fig. 1). This is consistent with our finding that SOCS-3 preferentially binds to the membrane-proximal GHR phosphotyrosine residues 333 and/or 338 (32Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), which are distinct from the more COOH-terminal major GHR-binding sites for STAT5b identified earlier (47Hansen J.A.

COS-1 cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding rat GHR (100 ng), reporter plasmid 4x-pT109-Luc (400 ng), CIS (200 ng), or SOCS-3 (200 ng) together with increasing amounts of STAT5b (5, 25, 150, or 500 ng). ARenilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK) (40 ng) was included to normalize samples for transfection efficiencies. After transfection, cells were stimulated for 5 h with 100 ng/ml rat GH. Cell lysates were then prepared and analyzed for STAT5 DNA binding activity by EMSA using a β-casein DNA probe (panel A) or assayed for normalized luciferase reporter activity (panel B). STAT5b protein levels detected by Western blot were maximal at the 150-ng plasmid level (data not shown). Panel A, EMSA gel of STAT5 DNA binding activity, assayed using β-casein probe, in extracts of cells transfected with the indicated factors and then stimulated with GH for 5 h. CIS inhibits GH-inducible STAT5b transcriptional activity more completely at low STAT5b levels, whereas the inhibition by SOCS-3 is already complete at high STAT5b levels. STAT5b EMSA activity in the presence of CIS or SOCS-3 is graphed at each STAT5b plasmid level relative to the corresponding GH stimulated activity obtained in the absence of SOCS/CIS expression plasmid (i.e. STAT5 activity for samples in lanes 2–9,respectively serve as the 100% values for the samples in lanes 11–18 and 20–27). Panel B, firefly luciferase reporter activity normalized for the level ofRenilla luciferase activity is graphed as a percentage of the GH stimulated activity obtained in the absence of CIS or SOCS-3 expression (mean ± S.D., n = 4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) CIS inhibition of STAT5b-stimulated ntcp-luciferase reporter activity, measured after 24 h GH treatment, is more complete than the inhibition of STAT5b EMSA activity, measured after 30 min GH treatment (32Ram P.A. Waxman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35553-35561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether this discrepancy reflects a time dependence of the inhibitory action of CIS, COS-1 cells transfected with GHR, STAT5b, and CIS were stimulated with GH for times ranging from 15 to 300 min, at which time cell extracts were assayed for STAT5b EMSA activity. As seen in Fig. 2 A, the inhibitory effect of CIS on STAT5b EMSA activity was increased as a function of time after GH treatment, becoming maximal by 180 min. Western blotting confirmed the consistency of cellular STAT5b protein levels during the course of GH treatment (Fig. 2 A, inset). In contrast to CIS, SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 were already maximally inhibitory at 15–60 min, while SOCS-2 was partially inhibitory, even after 300 min GH treatment (panel B and data not shown). The time dependence of the inhibitory action of CIS, but not that of the other SOCS/CIS proteins, further demonstrates that CIS inhibits signaling from the GHR·JAK2 complex to STAT5b in a manner that is fundamentally different from the other SOCS/CIS proteins. We next examined whether the time-dependent nature of CIS inhibition is associated with GH-stimulated CIS protein degradation. COS-1 cells transfected with GHR, STAT5b, and CIS were stimulated with GH, and cell extracts were then assayed for CIS protein, detected by Western blotting using an antibody directed at the cloned protein's NH2-terminal c-Myc tag. Short-term GH treatment, associated with partial inhibition of STAT5b activity (Fig. 2), did not lead to a decrease in CIS protein levels (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3 and 4 versus 1 and 2). By contrast, longer term GH treatment resulted in a significant decline in CIS protein (Fig. 3 A, lanes 7 and 8 versus 5 and6; also see inset of Fig. 2 A). No such GH-stimulated decrease was seen in the case of SOCS-3 protein (Fig. 3 B, lanes 9–12 versus 1–4). Treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (50 μm) (49Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar), added 15 min prior to GH, effectively prevented the GH-induced degradation CIS (Fig. 3 A, lanes 13–20 versus 1–12; Fig. 3 B, lanes 5–8 versus 1–4). Thus, the proteasome pathway participates in GH-induced CIS degradation. During the course of these studies we observed that the loss of CIS protein was, paradoxica"

All MAGUKs contain a Src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a region homologous to yeast guanylate kinase (GUK). We showed previously that one MAGUK protein, human CASK (hCASK), is widely expressed and associated with epithelial basolateral plasma membranes. We now report that hCASK binds another MAGUK, human discs large (hDlg). Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates that hCASK and hDlg colocalize at basolateral membranes of epithelial cells in small and large intestine. These proteins co-precipitate from lysates of an intestinal cell line, Caco-2. The GUK domain of hCASK binds the SH3 domain of hDlg in both yeast two-hybrid and fusion protein binding assays, and it is required for interaction with hDlg in transfected HEK293 cells. In addition, the SH3 and GUK domains of each protein participate in intramolecular binding that in vitro predominates over intermolecular binding. The SH3 and GUK domains of human p55 display the same interactions in yeast two-hybrid assays as those of hCASK. Not all SH3-GUK interactions among these MAGUKs are permissible, however, implying specificity to SH3-GUK interactions in vivo. These results suggest MAGUK scaffold assembly may be regulated through effects on intramolecular SH3-GUK binding."

Adipogenic effects of LCFA have also been documentedin vitro by demonstrating that exposure of preadipose cells to native or non-metabolized fatty acids, such as 2-bromopalmitate (2BrP), increased the number of cells committed to differentiate as well as expression levels of adipose-related genes (4Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular effects of fatty acids and some of their metabolites are related, at least in part, to activation of nuclear receptors called PPARs. Two different PPAR subtypes, δ and γ, are expressed in preadipose and adipose cells. PPARγ has been shown to play a central role in the control of gene expression and adipogenesis (5Tontonoz P. Hu E.

We have recently proposed that PPARδ acts as an early player in LCFA induction of terminal differentiation by promoting PPARγ expression. Fibroblasts ectopically expressing PPARδ respond to LCFA by transcriptional activation of genes for fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36), adipocyte lipid binding protein (ALBP), and PPARγ. Although treatment with fatty acids alone was not sufficient to trigger adipogenesis, exposure to a combination of PPARδ and PPARγ activators, for example 2BrP and thiazolidinedione, or to a pan-PPAR activator, such as prostacyclin, promotes the expression of a typical adipose differentiation program and adipogenesis (11Bastie C.

These experiments, which documented the role of PPARδ in the adipogenic action of LCFA, also illustrated a major difference between fibroblasts and preadipose cells. Fibroblasts expressing PPARδ strictly require exposure to strong PPARγ activators to trigger terminal differentiation, whereas preadipose cells do not. A similar situation had already been described for PPARγ-expressing fibroblasts (5Tontonoz P. Hu E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3133) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may reflect the ability of differentiating preadipose cells to synthesize and to accumulate enough endogenous PPARγ activator to undergo terminal differentiation. Because many other differences could exist between preadipose cells and PPAR-expressing fibroblasts, it is crucial to examine the role of these transcription factors in a preadipose cellular context to confirm their role in adipocyte differentiation. Therefore, we have investigated the effects of overexpression of PPARδ and dominant-negative PPARδ mutant on the control by LCFA of gene expression and terminal differentiation in Ob1771 preadipose cells. The dominant-negative PPARδ was generated by substitution of a glutamate residue by a proline in the loop preceding the AF-2 domain. This was based on numerous studies (12Schulman I.G. Juguillon H.

We report that overexpression of PPARδ enhances LCFA responsiveness of preadipose cells in terms of maximal response and sensitivity and promotes terminal adipose differentiation. By opposition, expression of a PPARδ mutant, that exerts a dominant-negative action, strongly decreases both the short term, i.e. activation of gene expression, and long term, i.e. adipogenesis, responses to LCFA. The retroviral constructs containing PPARδ cDNA or PPARδE411P mutant cDNA were derived from pSG5-FAAR (20Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol.

Kristiansen, University of Odense, Denmark). The PPARδE411P was obtained by the site-directed mutagenesis method of Viville (21Viville S. Methods Mol. Biol. 1995; 31: 57-65Google Scholar) using the 5′-CATCATCTGGGCGTGTGGGGTGACCAGCTG-3′ oligonucleotide, and the construct was verified by sequencing. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 33 μm biotin, 17 nm calcium pantothenate (standard medium). For differentiation, cells were shifted after confluence to a standard medium supplemented with 17 nm insulin and 1 nmtriiodothyronine (differentiation medium). Medium was changed every other day. Oil Red O staining was performed as described previously (22Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1994; 1: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (746) Google Scholar). BOSC23 cells were transfected at 50–70% of confluence by lipofection (Fugene 6, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) by 8 μg of pBizeoneo or pBizeoneoPPARδ or pBizeoneoPPARδE411P expression vectors. After 8 h, cells were re-fed with fresh standard medium and viral supernatants were collected 48 h later. Ob1771 (23Amri E.Z. Dani C. Doglio A. Etienne J. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Biochem. J. 1986; 238: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or 3T3F442A (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1994; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (616) Google Scholar) cells grown in standard medium were infected with equal titers of recombinant virus for 6 h and then maintained for 48 h in fresh standard medium and then replated with a 1:5 dilution in standard medium containing 0.4 mg/ml Geneticin. Stable populations were obtained after 7–10 days of selection. HEK-293 cells were grown in standard medium and plated in 24-well plates. At 80% confluence, cells were transfected by Fugene 6 with 0.5 μg/well 3xACOPPRE-Tk luciferase reporter vector, 25 ng/well pCMV-RXRα expression vector, 15 ng/well pCMV-βGalactosidase vector, and various amounts of pBizeoneoPPARδ or pBizeoneoPPARδE411P expression vectors. After 6 h, cells were re-fed with fresh standard medium with or without 50 μm2BrP. A 50 mm stock solution of 2BrP and dilutions were prepared in Me2SO. Luciferase and galactosidase activities were analyzed 48 h later using the luciferase assay system (Promega France), and the Galacto-Light assay system (Tropix, PerkinElmer, France), respectively. Each transfection was performed in triplicate, and the fluorescence of the samples was measured using a 1450 Micro Beta luminometer (Wallac, Finland). Total RNA was prepared and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (4Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the random priming kit from Stratagene, and hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in a 50% formamide buffer. Blots were subjected to digital imaging (FujixBAS1000). GAPDH mRNA, which is not affected by adipose differentiation, was monitored as the internal standard. Total cell extracts were prepared from the various virally infected Ob1771 and 3T3F-442A populations, in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7, 4), 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm vanadate, 0,5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0,1% Nonidet P-40. The extracts were separated on 10% polyacrylamide SDS gels and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes. PPARδ and PPARδE441P mutant proteins were detected using a polyclonal antiserum raised against the A/B domain of mouse PPARδ and which recognizes native and mutated PPARδ. Immunodetection was performed by chemiluminescence using an ECL reagent from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (France). Glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity, which provides the glycerol 3-phosphate required for triglyceride synthesis and is induced during terminal differentiation, was assayed spectrophotometrically as described previously (25Negrel R. Grimaldi P. Ailhaud G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 6054-6058Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity was expressed in milliunits,i.e. nanomoles of product formed per min/mg of protein. Protein content of samples was determined according to Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 173-181Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Cellular triglyceride content was measured by using the Sigma Triglycerides 320-UV kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Triolein was used as standard. Culture media, fetal calf serum, and Geneticin were from Life Technologies, Inc. (France). 2BrP and other chemical products were purchased from Sigma and Aldrich (France). Radioactive materials and nylon membranes were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (France). Rosiglitazone was a kind gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals (United Kingdom). The PPARδE411P mutant was obtained by replacing Glu-411 by a proline residue. This mutated PPARδ was assayed for activation of a PPAR-responsive reporter gene and for dominant-negative activity against either native PPARδ or PPARγ. HEK-293 cells were transfected with a PPAR-responsive luciferase reporter (27Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 258: 771-774Crossref Scopus (1525) Google Scholar) and an expression vector for the obligate partner RXRα. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of these cells with 2BrP, a non-metabolized long-chain fatty acid (28Grimaldi P.A. Knobel S.M. Whitesell R.R. Abumrad N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cells transfected with the PPARδ expression vector showed a 12-fold 2BrP-dependent activation. In contrast, no activation was observed in cells transfected with the mutated PPARδ, indicating that this mutant is inactive.Figure 1Characterization of a dominant-negative mutation of PPAR δ. A, HEK-293 cells were transfected as described under “Experimental Procedures” with luciferase and galactosidase plasmids, 25 ng of RXRα expression vector, and the indicated amounts in nanograms of PPARδ and PPARδE411P expression vectors. Cells were then maintained for 48 h in the absence (open bars) or presence (solid bars) of 50 μm 2BrP prior to determination of luciferase and galactosidase activities. B, HEK-293 cells were treated as in A but transfected with a PPARγ expression vector instead PPARδ expression vector and exposed (hatched bars) or not (open bars) to 50 μm rosiglitazone for 48 h prior to enzymatic assays. Results are presented by taking as 1 the value obtained for cells maintained in control medium and transfected with PPARδ (A) or PPARγ (B) vectors and are the mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The dominant-negative activity of PPARδE411P was then investigated by transfection of HEK-293 cells with a constant amount of PPARδ (Fig. 1 A) or PPARγ (Fig. 1 B) expression vector and increasing amounts of PPARδE411P expression vector. These experiments revealed that PPARδE411P inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the PPARδ-mediated transactivation. Luciferase induction was decreased by 50% and 85% when the mutated PPARδ was used in a 4- and 20-fold excess, respectively (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, PPARδE411P did not inhibit rosiglitazone-induced and PPARγ-mediated transactivation of the reporter gene (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these observations indicated that the PPARδE411P exerts a dominant-negative activity specifically on the PPARδ-mediated transactivation. Expression of either PPARδ or dominant-negative mutant PPARδE411P was accomplished in Ob1771 by retroviral infection (11Bastie C. Holst D. Gaillard D. Jehl-Pietri C. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21920-21925Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, Ob1771Biz cells expressed at day 1 post-confluence the endogenous PPARδ mRNA at the expected size of 3.5 kb. A stronger signal was found at about 5 kb corresponding to the viral transcript in both Ob1771PPARδ and Ob1771PPARδE411P. Further experiments revealed that the level of endogenous PPARδ mRNA increased by 4-fold during the first week after confluence in all cell populations, whereas expression of BizeoneoPPARδ and BizeoneoPPARδE411P mRNA remained unchanged (not shown). Western blot analysis, performed with an antiserum directed against the PPARδ A/B domain and thus cross-reacting with both native and mutated proteins, revealed that at day 1 post-confluence Ob1771PPARδ and Ob1771PPARδE411P cells contained, respectively, 8- and 6-fold more PPARδ protein than did control Ob1771Biz cells (Fig. 2 B). To investigate the effects of PPARδ and the dominant-negative PPARδ mutant on responsiveness to LCFA-induced transcription, Ob1771Biz, Ob1771PPARδ, and Ob1771PPARδE411P cell populations were grown to confluence and then exposed for 2 days to increasing concentrations of 2BrP. As described previously for parental Ob1771 cells (29Amri E.Z. Bertrand B. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 1449-1456Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), control Ob1771Biz cells showed a fatty acid dose-dependent induction of the fatty acid transporter FAT and ALBP mRNA (Fig. 3). Induction of these genes was markedly enhanced in Ob1771 overexpressing PPARδ. These cells were also more sensitive to 2BrP than control cells (EC50 of about 10 μm in Ob1771PPARδversus greater than 30 μm in Ob1771Biz). In contrast, Ob1771 expressing the dominant-negative PPARδ displayed a reduced induction of FAT and ALBP mRNA even at higher fatty acid concentrations. Interestingly, the mutated protein did not completely abolish the transcriptional response to 2BrP. Taken together, the data indicate that a change in the PPARδ activity, i.e. overexpression or inhibition, modulates the action of LCFA on gene expression in preadipose cells. To promote adipogenesis, cells were maintained after confluence in differentiation medium and treated for the first 5 days with increasing concentrations of 2BrP. Adipogenesis was estimated by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 4) and by determination of cellular triglyceride amounts (Fig. 5) at day 14 post-confluence and measurements of GPDH activity at days 9 and 14 (Fig. 6).Figure 6Effects of PPARδ and dominant-negative PPARδ on GPDH expression in Ob1771 cells. Ob1771Biz (▪), Ob1771PPARδ (●), and Ob1771PPARδE411P (▴) cells were maintained as in Fig. 4 and GPDH specific activity was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” at days 9 and 14 post-confluence. Results are the mean ± S.D. from three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As described previously for the original Ob1771 cell line (4Amri E.Z. Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P.A. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 930-937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2BrP treatment during the preadipose state enhanced terminal differentiation in Ob1771Biz cells in a dose-dependent manner, as shown by the tremendous increase of triglyceride accumulation (Figs. 4 and 5). The adipogenic effect of the fatty acid was also illustrated by the induction of GPDH activity during the course of differentiation (day 9) or at the end of the process (day 14). Compared with control cells, Ob1771PPARδ cells displayed an increased ability to differentiate and enhanced fatty acid sensitivity. This is illustrated by greater increases of both triglyceride accumulation (Figs. 4 and 5) and GPDH activity (Fig. 6) occurring at lower 2BrP concentrations. Interestingly, as shown by the Oil Red O staining, adipose differentiation was nearly complete when the cells were treated by 25 μm fatty acid, which suggests that PPARδ overexpression dramatically promoted the commitment of preadipose cells to terminal differentiation. The decrease of PPARδ activity in Ob1771, expressing the dominant-negative form of this nuclear receptor, resulted in a significant reduction of adipose differentiation. Indeed, Ob1771PPARδE411P cells did not accumulate lipids when maintained in low 2BrP concentrations. At high concentrations of 2BrP, these cells displayed moderate adipogenesis (Fig. 4) and contained less triglyceride than control cells (Fig. 5). This is confirmed by the significantly lower GPDH activities measured in Ob1771PPARδE411P than in control cells under all conditions assayed (Fig. 6). Because PPARγ plays a crucial role in terminal differentiation, we investigated its expression pattern in the three cell populations treated with 25 μm 2BrP during the first 5 days after confluence. As described for the original Ob1771 line (20Amri E.Z. Bonino F. Ailhaud G. Abumrad N.A. Grimaldi P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2367-2371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), in Ob1771Biz cells, PPARγ mRNA emerged after confluence and gradually increased until terminal differentiation (Fig. 7). In Ob1771PPARδ, PPARγ mRNA was already detected at confluence and accumulated thereafter to reach a maximal value at day 6. Noteworthy, at the end of adipose differentiation, i.e. day 14, PPARγ mRNA amounts were nearly similar in the two cell populations. In contrast, expression of the dominant-negative PPARδ resulted in a marked down-regulation of PPARγ mRNA. Expression levels remained relatively low and were, at day 14 post-confluence, 6-fold lower than those measured in control cells. The effects of dominant-negative PPARδ were also investigated in the 3T3-F442A preadipose cell line, which was established from mouse embryo (24Green H. Kehinde O. Cell. 1994; 7: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Cell populations were obtained after infection with retroviral pBizeoneo vector with or without the dominant-negative PPARδ coding sequence. Fig. 8 A shows that 442Abiz cells expressed a significant level of PPARδ at confluence, whereas PPARδ protein was 8-fold more abundant in confluent 442APPARδE441P cells. Exposure for 4 days after confluence to 10 μm 2BrP was associated with low adipogenesis in 442APPARδE411P cells, indicating that the dominant-negative PPARδ mutant strongly repressed the process. This is evidenced by the marked reduction of Oil Red O staining in 442APPARδE411P population. Although treatment of these cells with 2BrP significantly increased lipid accumulation, levels still remained lower than those observed in 442Abiz cells maintained in control medium without 2BrP (Fig. 8 B). The time course of PPARγ gene expression was investigated in 442Abiz and 442APPARδE411P cells exposed to 2BrP. In 442Abiz, PPARγ mRNA emerged at day 2 post-confluence and then accumulated rapidly to reach a maximal level at day 5. On the other hand, the induction of PPARγ mRNA was seriously delayed and reduced in 442APPARδE411P cells,i.e. emerging only at day 5 and remaining lower than in control cells at all times of determination (Fig. 8 C). Consistent with the Oil Red O staining, 442APPARδE411P cells expressed lower amounts of ALBP, FAT, and GPDH mRNAs than control cells when maintained in the absence or presence of 2BrP treatment (Fig. 8 D). These findings demonstrate that PPARδ is important for LCFA regulation of 3T3-F442A differentiation. This study is a first examination of the role of PPARδ in mediating LCFA regulation of gene expression and adipogenesis in preadipose cells. Two complementary approaches have been used in the study, i.e. overexpression of the native nuclear receptor and expression of a dominant-negative PPARδ mutant. As would be predicted based on studies with other nuclear receptors (17Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), the substitution of a glutamate residue by a proline at position 411 in PPARδ generates a protein without transcriptional activity and which exerts an inhibitory effect on the endogenous PPARδ. With other nuclear receptors, such mutations yield proteins that bind the ligand and the DNA-responsive element but that constitutively remain in a repressed form (19Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). Consequently, the inhibitory action of the constitutively repressed PPARδE411P mutant may reflect its competition with endogenous native PPARδ for binding to the PPRE. However, regardless of the underlying mechanism behind the dominant-negative activity of PPARδE411P, it is worth noting that the mutant did not exert a complete inhibition on the native receptor even when used in high excess (Fig. 1 A) and did not affect the transcriptional activity of PPARγ (Fig. 1 B). The lack of effect on PPARγ probably relates to the higher affinity of the γ isoform for the PPRE as compared with that of PPARδ. Such a difference in binding affinities between the two isoforms for several natural PPRE has been previously documented by electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (30Juge-Aubry C. Pernin A. Favez T. Burger A.G. Wahli W. Meier C.A. Desvergne B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25252-25259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). This work clearly demonstrates that a change in PPARδ level or activity strongly alters the response of Ob1771 cells to LCFA and that this nuclear receptor acts early in the adipose differentiation time course. Preadipose Ob1771PPARδ cells, in which the PPARδ level was increased by retroviral infection, display a magnified response to fatty acids as shown by higher induction of FAT and ALBP gene expression at low fatty acid concentrations (Fig. 3). The adipogenic action of fatty acids in promoting terminal differentiation also occurs at lower concentration in Ob1771PPARδ as shown by Oil Red O staining (Fig. 4), by GPDH activity (Fig. 5), and by triglyceride accumulation (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the almost complete terminal differentiation, shown by the homogenous Oil Red O staining observed in Ob1771PPARδ exposed for only the first 5 days to 2BrP (Fig. 4), strongly supports a crucial role of LCFA activated-PPARδ during early confluent phase in promoting the commitment of preadipocytes to adipogenesis. In addition to enhancing the effects of added fatty acids, the increase in PPARδ expression also exerts a potent action on terminal adipose differentiation of cells maintained in control medium. Ob1771PPARδ cells accumulate significantly more lipids (Fig. 5) and express more GPDH activity (Fig. 6) than do control cells. The considerable increase of terminal differentiation observed in the absence of added 2BrP could be explained by increased sensitivity to the effects of LCFA from the serum or from endogenous origin or to other naturally occurring activators such as prostacyclin, a potent PPARδ activator (7Brun R.P. Tontonoz P. Forman B.M. Ellis R. Chen J. Evans R.M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 974-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) synthesized by early confluent Ob1771 cells (31Negrel R. Ailhaud G. Biochem. Cell Biol. Commun. 1981; 98: 768-777Google Scholar). The role of PPARδ as a nuclear mediator of LCFA effects on gene transcription and adipose differentiation is confirmed by the demonstration that expressing the dominant-negative mutant in Ob1771 cells considerably attenuates 2BrP-induced transcriptions of FAT and ALBP genes in preadipose cells (Fig. 3) and 2BrP enhancement of adipogenesis (Fig. 4). However, the cells remain able to respond to the fatty acid derivative, as shown by exposure to high concentrations of 2BrP. Morphological (Fig. 4) and biochemical investigations (Figs. 5and 6) indicate that expression of the dominant-negative mutant, by partially inhibiting action of the endogenous PPARδ, dramatically impairs terminal differentiation of Ob1771 cells. Ob1771PPARδE411P cells do not undergo terminal differentiation when maintained in medium containing low concentrations of activator but display adipogenesis when high concentrations of 2BrP are used. Residual responses during short term or long term exposure to high concentrations of LCFA are not surprising, because transactivation experiments revealed that the dominant-negative PPARδ mutant, even when used at a high excess, does not completely suppress fatty acid activation of the native nuclear receptor (Fig. 1). The amount of the mutated protein expressed in Ob1771PPARδE411P at day 1 after confluence was estimated to be approximately 6-fold higher than the endogenous PPAR (Fig. 2 B). Thus, in Ob1771PPARδE411P cells exposed to high concentrations of 2BrP, the amount of activated native PPARδ may be high enough to effectively compete with the mutated repressed receptor for binding to the PPRE and to allow transcription of LCFA-responsive genes. It is possible that, at high concentrations of LCFA, there is accumulation of ligand-activated native PPARδ, which favors the binding of the active transcription factor to the PPRE of LCFA-responsive gene promoters. The respective positive or negative actions of either native or dominant-negative PPARδ on terminal differentiation are a likely consequence of the alterations of PPARγ expression. Although overexpression of the native nuclear receptor did not significantly change the maximal expression of PPARγ, it resulted in an earlier induction of its expression when compared with control cells. Expression of the dominant-negative mutant led to an impairment of PPARγ expression during the differentiation phase (Fig. 7). Thus, the pattern of PPARγ expression in the three different Ob1771-derived cell lines used in this study supports the interpretation that LCFA-activated PPARδ controls PPARγ gene expression and that PPARγ is crucial for the induction of genes related to terminal differentiation. These findings were applicable to both Ob1771 and 3T3F442A cells and indicated that they are not dependent on nor specific to a particular cell line. For example, despite the fact that terminal differentiation of 3T3-F442A cells is less dependent on fatty acid supply as shown for 442Abiz cells (Fig. 8, A and C), expression of the dominant-negative PPARδ in 3T3-F442A cells severely reduces adipogenesis in a way similar to Ob1771 cells. In summary, the observations reported in this study, clearly establish the role for PPARδ as nuclear mediator of LCFA-mediated transcriptional and adipogenic actions in a preadipose cell context. The findings suggest that changes in the amount or activity of this nuclear receptor in preadipose cells may have important functional consequences with respect to the response of adipose mass to nutritional changes. Possibly, up-regulation of the receptor would result in hypersensitivity to LCFA effects in increasing adipose tissue mass, whereas down-regulation may confer resistance to LCFA. PPARδ is also expressed in various tissues, including heart, skeletal muscle, and intestine, and it would be of interest to characterize what tissue-specific effects up- or down-regulation of this nuclear receptor would have in the whole animal. The dominant-negative PPARδ mutant described in this study can be used to selectively inhibit LCFA-induced transcriptional activation in particular tissues. The construction of transgenic animals expressing the PPARδE411P mutant in a tissue-specific manner would provide valuable information on the role of PPARδ in various tissues. We thank Nada A.

However, direct localization of the progelatinase A-binding site on TIMP-2 has not been reported since the TIMP-2 C domain has not been expressed in isolation. Although the loss of binding following deletion of this domain demonstrates its important role (10Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Ward R.V. Cockett M.I. Eaton D. Docherty A.J.P. Biochem.

Defining this site is important for understanding gelatinase A activation and cell surface localization. The transition from gelatinase A zymogen to the activation intermediate is critical for activation. Cleavage at Asn66-Leu67 in the gelatinase A prodomain (29Will H. Atkinson S.J. Butler G.S. Smyth B.

Activation is enhanced by MT1-MMP clustering, but the binding interactions that occur in the cell surface rafts of gelatinase A activation complexes are not resolved. Evidence indicates that cell surface-bound active gelatinase A, rather than soluble active enzyme, is needed to efficiently perform the final activation cleavage (11Itoh Y. Ito A. Iwata K.

Heparin binding is known to enhance activation in vitro (19Emmert-Buck M.R. Emonard H.P. Corcoran M.L. Krutzsch H.C. Foidart J-M. Stetler-Stevenson W.G.

Clustering of MT1-MMP at the cell surface fulfills the same role as heparin in vitro by concentrating gelatinase A intermediate and active forms. Activation is also associated with the autocatalytic shedding of the MT1-MMP catalytic domain (33Hernandez-Barrantes S. Toth M. Bernardo M.M. Yurkova M. Gervasi D.C. Yuval R. Sang Q.A. Fridman R. J.

Another form of MT1-MMP starting at Ile256 near the Met turn has also been described (34Lehti K. Lohi J. Valtanen H. Keski-Oja J. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). We have proposed that MT1-MMP degradation to the 44-kDa form may release the activated gelatinase A·TIMP-2 complex from the cell surface (7Steffensen B. Bigg H.F. Overall C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20622-20628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, the potential functions of the 44-kDa form are unknown. It is unclear which properties of the enzyme this remnant form of MT1-MMP retains. It is not known if the 44-kDa form binds TIMP-2, whether it directly participates in binding MT1-MMP or gelatinase A, or whether it can modulate gelatinase A activation. In this study we have investigated the potential role of the 44-kDa form of MT1-MMP in gelatinase A activation by analysis of the interactions of recombinant MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain with TIMP-2, gelatinase A, and MT1-MMP. We report experiments that exclude any direct involvement of the ectodomain of the 44-kDa form of MT1-MMP in gelatinase A activation. In addition, we have refined the location of the gelatinase A-binding site on the TIMP-2 C domain and demonstrate the stability of the gelatinase A activation intermediate. The cDNA encoding the hemopexin C domain of human MT1-MMP was PCR amplified and cloned into the pGYMX expression vector (32Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Purified protein in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (140 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4·7H2O, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4), with or without 0.05% Brij 35 was snap frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. By quantitative amino acid analysis, electrospray mass spectroscopy, and optical density measurements using a Cary 219 spectrophotometer extinction coefficients at 280 nm of 2.78, 3.02, and 1.97 ml mg−1 cm−1 were calculated for the hemopexin C domain proteins of MT1-MMP plus/minus linker and gelatinase A, respectively. Electrospray mass spectroscopy and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by staining with silver nitrate assessed protein purity. Recombinant human TIMP-2 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells under methotrexate selection and purified by chromatography on Reactive Green 5, gelatin Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and heparin-Sepharose resins. 3C. M. Morrison, H. F. Bigg, G. S. Butler, and C. M. Overall, unpublished data. The TIMP-2 extinction coefficient at 280 nm was calculated to be 1.49 ml mg−1 cm−1. Peptides were synthesized on a PE-Applied Biosystems 432 Synthesizer, high performance liquid chromatography purified, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption-time of flight mass spectroscopy (Ciphergen) to confirm fidelity. All peptides terminated with a cysteine, for efficient disulfide coupling to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and chromatography resins, then a Gly-Gly flexible spacer unless the terminal cysteine was present in the natural sequence. Underlined residues in the peptide sequences listed differ from the natural sequence. The NH2 terminus was acetylated (Ac-) to mimic the protein backbone unless a NH2-terminal Cys was present; in which case the carboxyl terminus was blocked as an amide (-CONH2). Peptides correspond to (i) the polyHis fusion-tag of the expressed proteins (Ac-ATG[H]6IEGRGGC) (36Steffensen B. Wallon U.M. Overall C.M. J. Biol.

Antipeptide antibodies were raised against keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled peptide in two rabbits for each peptide. Antiserum was purified for the antipeptide specific antibodies by affinity chromatography over peptide coupled to Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) or activated cyanogen bromide resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and assayed for specificity and concentration by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay against the peptide and recombinant protein. Antibodies were designated αHis6, α72ex12, αproMT1, αMT1-CD, αN-T2, and αC-T2, respectively. 96-Well microtiter plates were coated with 0.2–0.6 μg of the coating protein in 15 mmNa2CO3, 35 mm NaHCO3, 0.02% (w/v) NaN3, pH 9.6, overnight at 4 °C as described (27Overall C.M.

Wells were then blocked with 2.5% (w/v) ovalbumin or 1% (w/v) BSA in PBS and serially diluted recombinant hemopexin C domain proteins then added (generally at a concentration of 5.12 μm to 7.7 pm in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS/well). After a 1–2 h incubation, extensive washes with PBS, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 were performed and bound recombinant protein was quantitated using affinity purified antibody followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. After the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (Sigma) as substrate, color development was quantitated at 405 nm in a ThermoMax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices) at constant temperature. MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain with linker was immobilized on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) mini-columns. Gelatinase A hemopexin C domain or TIMP-2 was then loaded in PBS. Chromatography of TIMP-2 was performed over immobilized gelatinase A hemopexin C domain protein bound to mini columns (37Overall C.M. Wrana J.L. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1860-1869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of 200 μl chelating Sepharose 6B charged with Zn2+ ions to which the poly-His tag of the recombinant protein binds with high affinity. After PBS washes, the column was eluted with a 0.2–1.0 m NaCl step gradient and then 10% dimethyl sulfoxide. Any remaining protein was eluted with 50 mm EDTA in PBS. TIMP-2 chromatographed alone did not bind to the Zn2+-chelate resin. Binding was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis of protein in the unbound, PBS wash, and eluates. Heat-denatured protein samples were separated under reducing (65 mmdithiothreitol) or nonreducing conditions by SDS-PAGE using 15% gels and stained with silver nitrate or Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For zymography, aliquots of conditioned culture medium were separated under nonreducing conditions on 10% polyacrylamide gels copolymerized with 100 μg/ml gelatin. The vectors pGBT9 and pGAD424 (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc.) were used to make the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and Gal4 activation domain fusion constructs, respectively, for use in the yeast two-hybrid system (38Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1988; 340: 245-246Crossref Scopus (4880) Google Scholar). To each of these domains were fused the human TIMP-2 C domain residues Glu153-Pro221 or the gelatinase A hemopexin C domain residues Gly446-Cys660. cDNAs encoding the C domains were PCR amplified from full-length cDNA and subcloned into the shuttle/expression vectors. The accuracy of the PCR reaction was confirmed by automated sequencing of both cDNA strands. Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c (CLONTECH) was transformed with the plasmids by electroporation and plated on Leu−, Trp−, His−, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal)-containing agar and tested for expression of reporter genes. The strain HF7c contains the HIS3 and the LacZ gene under the control of a Gal4 responsive promoter. β-Galactosidase activity resulting from up-regulation of the LacZ reporter gene was quantitated by a colorimetric assay. In brief, yeast transformants containing fusion constructs were grown in 5 ml of the appropriate selection medium at 30 °C for 16 h and then transferred to YPD medium and grown to mid-log phase. Cells were lysed and assayed for β-galactosidase activity with the synthetic substrateo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) (39Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics.

For experiments, cells were seeded at 1.8–2.0 × 104 cells/microtiter well and grown in 10% newborn calf serum/α-minimum essential medium. At confluency, cells were grown serum-free for 24 h, then stimulated with ConA (20 μg/ml, 16–30 h) in serum-free α-minimum essential medium to induce the cellular activation of endogenous gelatinase A (12Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MT1-MMP hemopexin C domain (± linker), gelatinase A hemopexin C domain, or PBS vehicle alone, was added to the ConA-treated or untreated cells in a total volume of 100 μl of 50% PBS, 50% serum-free medium. After 24-h incubation, the conditioned culture medium was assayed by zymography to determine the effects of the addition of the exogenous hemopexin C domains on ConA-induced gelatinase A activation. For immunocytochemical studies, ROS 17/2.8 cells were harvested and seeded onto chamber slides (Nunc). Semi-confluency was typically reached after 96 h of growth whereupon the cultures were washed with PBS and growth continued for 16 h serum-free with or without ConA (20 μg/ml) (12Overall C.M. Sodek J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21141-21151Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified gelatinase A hemopexin C domain in PBS was diluted to 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 ng/ml serum-free medium in the presence of 1% (w/v) BSA.

The treated cells were then fixed in 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature and washed, first in PBS containing 1% (w/v) ovalbumin (2 × 3 min) and then in PBS alone (2 × 3 min). Primary antibodies (α72ex12, αproMT1) were added to the fixed, nonpermeabilized cells in PBS containing 1% (w/v) ovalbumin and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Sequential washes were performed with PBS, PBS + 1% (w/v) ovalbumin, and then PBS alone (2 × 3 min each) followed by the addition of goat anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). To stain cell membranes, cell surfaces were oxidized with 4.2 mmperiodate (BDH Inc.) in PBS for 30 min on ice at 4 °C, followed by three PBS washes and incubation with 10 mmfluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (Molecular Probes) in 1% (w/v) ovalbumin, PBS (2 h, 37 °C) (40Wilchek M.

Because aggrecan is highly glycosylated with chondroitin sulfate (CS) and keratan sulfate (KS), we investigated whether glycosylation affects digestion by aggrecanase at the Glu373–Ala374 bond. Treatment of bovine aggrecan monomers to remove CS and KS resulted in loss of cleavage at this site, suggesting that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play a role in cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond. In contrast, MMP-3 cleavage at the Ser341–Phe342bond was not affected by glycosidase treatment of aggrecan. Removal of KS, but not CS, prevented cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond. Thus, KS residues may be important for recognition of this cleavage site by aggrecanase. KS glycosylation has been observed at sites adjacent to the Glu373-Ala374 bond in steer aggrecan, but not in calf aggrecan (Barry, F. P., Rosenberg, L. C., Gaw, J. U., Gaw, J. U., Koob, T. J., and Neame, P. J. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 20516–20524). Interestingly, although we found that aggrecanase degraded both calf and steer cartilage aggrecan, the proportion of fragments generated by cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond was higher in steer than in calf, consistent with our observations using aggrecan treated to remove KS. We conclude that the GAG content of aggrecan influences the specificity of aggrecanase for cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond and suggest that age may be a factor in aggrecanase degradation of cartilage.

The major type of proteoglycan present in cartilage is aggrecan, which is composed of a protein core that contains a high level of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs),1both CS and KS. The sulfate groups of these sugar molecules impart a net negative charge to aggrecan thus providing the attractive forces that incorporate water into the matrix and endow the tissue with its shock-absorbing quality.The aggrecan core protein contains three globular domains; G1, through which the molecule binds to hyaluronic acid, G2, and G3 (1Hardingham T.E.

In diseased tissue, the matrix is lost, and this loss is associated with degradation of the aggrecan monomers (3Mankin HJ Lippiello L. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Am. Vol. 1970; 52: 424-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The interglobular domain (IGD) of the aggrecan core protein, which is located between G1 and G2, contains proteolytic cleavage sites that are believed to be critical to the overall loss of aggrecan function. Two major sites of digestion have been identified within the IGD between residues Asn341and Phe342 and between Glu373 and Ala374. The first site has been shown to be cleaved by a variety of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) (4Fosang A.J. Neame P.J. Hardingham T.E. Murphy G Hamilton J.A. J. Biol.

The contribution of aggrecanase to aggrecan cleavage has been investigated based on the generation of products that terminate with Glu373 or begin with Ala374. Several reports have shown that the majority of the aggrecan fragments found both in vitro in response to stimulated cartilage degradation (9Sandy J.D. Boynton R.E. Flannery C.R. J. Biol.

Hughes C.E. Decicco C.P. Caterson B. Tortorella M.D. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 1998; 6: 214-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) show that there is a strong correlation between specific cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond and the release of aggrecan catabolites in response to cytokine stimulation. In addition, the ability of inhibitors to block the release of aggrecan catabolites correlates with their ability to block specific cleavage at the aggrecanase site. Taken together these data suggest that aggrecanase plays a key role in aggrecan degradation. Thus, identifying factors that influence the ability of aggrecanase to cleave cartilage aggrecan is important for understanding the regulation of aggrecan catabolism by this enzyme in both normal matrix turnover and in arthritic disease.Because the aggrecan core protein is heavily glycosylated, it is possible that the glycosaminoglycans on the aggrecan molecule may affect the ability of either MMPs or aggrecanase to cleave the core protein. This notion is especially intriguing based on the finding by Barry et al. (17Barry F.P. Rosenberg L.C. Gaw J.U. Gaw J.U. Koob T.J. Neame P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20516-20524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) that glycosylation of aggrecan in articular cartilage is altered with age and thus could potentially play a role in regulating the susceptibility of aggrecan to degradation during aging. These authors reported that aggrecan isolated from steer (age of 1.5–2 years) articular cartilage is post-translationally modified with a keratan sulfate within the sequence368NITEGEAR375 whereas aggrecan from calf (age of 1 week) articular cartilage lacks glycosylation in this region. Because this sequence contains the aggrecanase cleavage site, the presence of glycosylation may play a role in regulating aggrecanase-mediated degradation. Studies by Bayliss and co-workers (18Hutton S.E. Haward J. Maciewicz R. Bayliss M.T. Trans. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1996; 21: 150Google Scholar) detected aggrecan G1 fragments with the C terminus (ITEGE), indicating that they had been cleaved at the aggrecanase site in normal adult human articular cartilage but not in immature articular cartilage, and the amount of these aggrecanase-generated fragments increased with age. These data are consistent with the possibility that aggrecanase can cleave adult aggrecan more readily than the immature aggrecan, which lacks glycosylation in the region surrounding the aggrecanase cleavage site. Therefore, we investigated the influence of glycosylation on aggrecan digestion by aggrecanase.We have recently generated soluble aggrecanase activity in media from IL-1 stimulated bovine nasal cartilage and developed an enzymatic assay using purified bovine aggrecan monomers as substrate (19Arner E.C.

Products were monitored by Western analysis using the monoclonal antibody, BC-3, which recognizes the N terminus of the aggrecanase-generated products with the sequence 374ARGSVIL. In this report, we demonstrate that deglycosylation of the aggrecan substrate results in total inhibition of BC-3-reactive product generation by aggrecanase, suggesting that GAGs play a role in aggrecanase-mediated cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond. Further, we show that aggrecanase differs in the ability to cleave at the Glu373–Ala374 bond in steer versuscalf aggrecan, suggesting that the changes in glycosylation with age may influence the ability of aggrecan to be cleaved at the Glu373–Ala374 site by aggrecanase.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsFresh bovine nasal and articular cartilage were obtained from Covance Inc., (Denver, PA).

BSA, coupled to peptides containing the sequence ARGSVIL, was prepared by Quality Controlled Biochemicals (Hopkinton, MA).MethodsPreparation and Digestion of Freeze/Thawed CartilageArticular cartilage was peeled from the metacarpalphalangeal joint from calf (<3 months) or steer (>9 months), and rinsed several times in sterile saline. The tissue was rendered non-viable by freezing on dry ice, followed by thawing at 37 °C, and this cycle was repeated at least three times. The freeze/thawed cartilage was then used as an aggrecan substrate.Isolation of Aggrecan MonomersAggrecan was isolated from calf (<3 months) or steer (>9 months) nasal or articular cartilage by extraction in 4 m guanidine hydrochloride and separation by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (25Hascall V.C. Kimura J.H. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 769-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Gradient fractions with a density greater than 1.5 g/ml containing aggrecan monomers were dialyzed into water and lyophilized. Prior to enzymatic assay, aggrecan was resuspended in water at a concentration of 2 mg/ml (w/v). Calf and steer articular aggrecan preparations were found to be similar with respect to GAG concentration (steer: 1630 ± 71 μg/ml; calf: 1599 ± 51 μg/ml) as well as to staining in an anti-G1 Western analysis (described below).Preparation of Deglycosylated Aggrecan SubstrateDeglycosylated aggrecan substrate was prepared by incubating bovine aggrecan monomers with chondroitinase ABC (0.1 units/10 μg), keratanase (0.1 units/10 μg), and keratanase II (0.002 units/10 μg) for 4 h at 37 °C in 100 mmTris/HCl with 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5. Deglycosylation was confirmed by monitoring GAG concentration using the dimethylmethylene blue (DMMB) assay (27Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 9: 247-248Crossref Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Aggrecan incubated with heat-inactivated glycosidases served as a control. There was no difference in data obtained using fully glycosylated substrate, and this same substrate incubated with boiled deglycosylation enzymes (data not shown). Isolation of aggrecan core from digestion products by acetone precipitation did not alter results (data not shown), suggesting that the GAG fragments generated do not affect digestion by aggrecanase.Aggrecanase DigestionA crude preparation of aggrecanase was generated in conditioned media from bovine nasal cartilage stimulated over a 14-day culture period with human recombinant IL-1β (500 ng/ml) (19Arner E.C.

(May 22, 1997) WO 9718207 A2.Google Scholar), a potent broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor that is a weak inhibitor of aggrecanase (IC50 > 10 μm), was included during aggrecanase digestion. Aggrecanase was incubated with native or deglycosylated substrate (50 μg, 300 nm) for up to 4 h or freeze/thawed calf or steer articular cartilage (10–20 mg) for up to 48 h at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, and the reaction was quenched with EDTA (20 mm). Aggrecan fragments released from the freeze/thawed tissue were determined colorimetrically by glycosaminoglycan assay (27Farndale R.W. Sayers C.A. Barrett A.J. Connect. Tissue Res. 1992; 9: 247-248Crossref Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Products of the enzymatic reaction were detected by Western analysis (19Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Trzaskos J.M. Decicco C.P.

A pre-quenched sample in which aggrecanase was treated with EDTA (20 mm) prior to incubation with substrate represents background levels of the BC-3-reactive fragments present in the aggrecanase preparation. Aggrecan (either native or deglycosylated) incubated in buffer alone for up to 4 h at 37 C had similar staining to the pre-quenched sample (data not shown). In previous studies, buffer from freeze/thawed steer cartilage incubated for 0–48 h was analyzed by BC-3 and AF-28 Western analysis, as well as for GAG release (31Arner E.C. Pratta M.A. Decicco C.P.

Although low levels of GAG release occurred over this time period, it was likely because of non-enzymatic diffusion of aggrecan from the cut surfaces of the cartilage as no BC-3 or AF-28 reactive fragments were detected.MMP-3 DigestionRecombinant C-terminally truncated pro-MMP-3 was activated for 24 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into 50 mm Tris, 10 mmCaCl2, 400 mm NaCl, 0.05% Brij 35, and 0.02% NaN3, pH 7.5. Aggrecan was digested with tMMP-3 as described above using 50 nm tMMP-3.Western Blot AnalysisFollowing digestion by aggrecanase or tMMP-3, aggrecan and aggrecan fragments in the reaction mixture were deglycosylated with chondroitinase ABC, keratanase, and keratanase II as described above, with the addition of a protease inhibitor mixture (COMPLETETM) based on conditions recommended by the manufacturer (1 tablet/50 ml). The mixture was shown to have no effect on the activity of the GAG digestion enzymes (data not shown). The samples were then precipitated with ice-cold acetone for 15 min, centrifuged (14000 × g) for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed by aspiration. The pellet was dried under nitrogen and solubilized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 4–12% gradient gel and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride overnight at 30 V in Tris/glycine, pH 8.3, transfer buffer containing 20% methanol, which resulted in the complete transfer of both low and high molecular weight aggrecan fragments (19Arner E.C.

Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA and then probed with various antibodies. Membranes were probed with BC-3 antibody (0.8 μg/ml) or AF-28 antibody (1:2000) in 1% BSA/TBS, and immunoreactive proteins were detected with goat anti-mouse IgG linked to alkaline phosphatase used at a 1:5000 dilution in 1% BSA/TBS, followed by the color reagent, NBT/BCIP substrate solution. Monoclonal antibody Mab 2035 (mouse anti-chondroitin-6-sulfate), which recognizes the chondroitin sulfate stubs on the core protein following deglycosylation, was diluted 1:1000 in 1% BSA/TBS. Western analysis was performed by the procedure described above. Anti-NITEGE and anti-G1 Western analyses were performed as described previously (13Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J.

In this report, we have demonstrated the following. 1) Aggrecanase generation of BC-3 reactive aggrecan fragments formed by specific cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond was eliminated with up to a 4-h digestion by prior deglycosylation of the aggrecan substrate. 2) Aggrecanase digestion of aggrecan in freeze/thawed calf cartilage, which lacks a keratan sulfate residue near the aggrecanase cleavage site that is present in steer aggrecan (17Barry F.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 20516-20524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), resulted in the generation of dramatically less BC-3 reactive fragments, and 3) digestion of isolated calf aggrecan by aggrecanase resulted in the generation of lower levels of both BC-3-reactive fragments with the ARGSV N terminus and G1 fragments with the NITEGE C terminus relative to the levels generated using isolated steer aggrecan.Although deglycosylation of the aggrecan substrate eliminated the generation of BC-3 reactive fragments representing cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond within the IGD, the deglycosylated substrate was cleaved by aggrecanase as evidenced by depletion of intact aggrecan as monitored by CSPG Western blot analysis. However, the fragments produced were of different sizes than those generated using the fully glycosylated substrate. Thus, aggrecanase appears to cleave the aggrecan core protein at different sites when the substrate lacks GAG side chains. Several additional aggrecanase-susceptible sites have been identified within the C-terminal domain of aggrecan (29Sandy J.D. Plaas A.H.K. Koob T.J. Acta Orthop. Scand. Suppl. 1995; 266: 26-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cleavage at these sites may be responsible for the alternative products produced with the deglycosylated aggrecan substrate. Conversely, other sites within the IGD may become susceptible to cleavage by aggrecanase following deglycosylation. Although the sites of cleavage in the deglycosylated substrate were not identified in the current studies, examination of the digests by Western blot analysis using the AF-28 antibody that recognizes the FFGVG N terminus generated by cleavage at the Ser341–Phe342 MMP site indicated that deglycosylation did not result in cleavage by aggrecanase at this site (data not shown).It has been reported that the GAG digestion enzyme preparations may contain low levels of contaminating proteases, and the use of a protease inhibitor mixture is recommended to eliminate any effect by contaminants on sample integrity (30Oike Y. Kimata K. Shinomura T. Suzuki S. Biochem. J. 1980; 191: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The protease inhibitor mixture included during deglycosylation of samples following enzymatic assay could not be used in the preparation of the deglycosylated substrate because the presence of the mixture would interfere with aggrecanase and tMMP-3 enzyme activities. However, two pieces of data suggest that the involvement of contaminating proteases in the current studies, if any, is minimal. First, in the CSPG Western analysis shown in Fig. 1 B, there was no apparent difference in staining between deglycosylated and native aggrecan substrate (lanes 1 versus 3), indicating that treatment during deglycosylation does not appreciably alter the core protein of aggrecan. Second, if the aggrecan core were degraded, one would expect the AF-28 Western analysis of MMP-3-digested deglycosylated aggrecan and native aggrecan (Fig. 2) to be different. The fact that there was no apparent difference in fragment pattern between deglycosylated and native substrate support the conclusion that the aggrecan core is not effected by deglycosylation treatment, and therefore, the differences noted are because of differences in glycosylation of the substrate.Our data using deglycosylated aggrecan as a substrate suggest that the ability of aggrecanase to cleave at the Glu373–Ala374 site within the IGD of aggrecan is dependent on the presence of GAGs that are associated with the aggrecan core protein. However, aggrecan from rat chondrosarcoma that lacks KS is cleaved at the Glu373–Ala374 bond, and this cleavage is presumably because of aggrecanase (13Lark M.W. Gordy J.T. Weidner J.R. Ayala J.

In addition, cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374 bond by aggrecanase was detected using recombinant substrates lacking KS (28Hughes C.E. Buttner F.H. Eidenmuller B. Caterson B. Bartnik E. J. Biol.

These data suggest that the presence of KS is not an absolute requirement for cleavage at the Glu373–Ala374bond, but rather that the presence of KS may increase the efficiency of cleavage at this site. There may also be differences in the cleavage mechanism of a relatively small peptide substrate and native aggrecan. Because we have recently reported cloning and expression of two proteases that possess aggrecanase activity (32Tortorella M.D. Burn T.C. Pratta M.A. Abbaszade I. Hollis J.M. Liu R. Rosenfeld S.A.

We examined the function of the V-ATPase in cytosolic Ca2+ homeostasis by comparing responses to a brief Ca2+ challenge of a V-ATPase mutant (vma2Δ) and wild-type cells treated with the V-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin A. The kinetics of the Ca2+ response were determined using transgenic aequorin as an in vivo cytosolic Ca2+ reporter system.

Their action provides the driving force for solute transport across endomembranes and contributes to Ca2+ and pH homeostasis of the cytosol (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

The yeast V-ATPase has emerged as an excellent model for the constitutive V-ATPase found in all eukaryotic cells because of the strong similarity between the yeast enzyme and other eukaryotic V-ATPases and the number of methodological approaches established in this organism. Fungi appear to be able to tolerate loss of V-ATPase function, but exhibit a variety of growth and morphological phenotypes (4Nelson H. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Disruption of genes encoding for any V-ATPase subunit inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, with the exception of the functionally redundant STV1 and VPH1 genes (7Manolson M.F. Wu B. Proteau D. Taillon B.E.

Yeast cells lacking a V-ATPase subunit can grow in medium buffered to pH 5, but fail to grow in medium buffered to pH 7.5, medium containing elevated calcium concentrations, or medium containing standard concentrations of non-fermentable carbon sources (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 2Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Although this set of Vma− phenotypes has been used both to identify new VMA genes and to characterize subunit structure and function of the yeast V-ATPase (8Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A.

Biomembr. 1999; 31: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), these phenotypes are still poorly understood. Furthermore, a temperature-conditionalvma mutant, in which loss of V-ATPase function can be induced by a shift to 37 °C, exhibited an exaggerated set of morphological phenotypes, including defects in cell morphology, actin distribution, and cytokinesis (12Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 267: 9773-9778Google Scholar). These phenotypes were more severe than those observed in a corresponding vma deletion strain, and indicate that an “acute” loss of V-ATPase function in the temperature conditional mutant can have different consequences, at least in the short term, from a “chronic” loss of V-ATPase function in vma deletion strains. This difference may be attributed to activation of compensatory mechanisms that allow cells to adapt to loss of V-ATPase function. Tight control of cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in yeast (50–200 nm range) is a prerequisite for proper function of Ca2+-dependent signal transduction pathways (13Iida H. Yawaga Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13391-13399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Davis T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and may also be critical for maintaining the solubility of phosphorylated metabolites in the cell (15Williams R.J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1990; 269: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Previous studies of Ca2+ homeostasis of S. cerevisiae have characterized a feedback mechanism for cytosolic Ca2+control involving calmodulin, calcineurin, and three intracellular Ca2+ transporters: Vcx1p, a vacuolar H+/Ca2+ exchanger, Pmc1p, a vacuolar Ca2+ pump, and Pmr1p, a Golgi Ca2+ pump with homology to Pmc1p (16Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Under typical growth conditions, the vacuole appears to be the major Ca2+ store in yeast (14Davis T. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1995; 30: 339-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recent results suggest that the two vacuolar transporters play complementary roles in Ca2+ homeostasis (17Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P. Fu L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Vcx1p is predominantly responsible for restoring cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations after a brief challenge with high extracellular Ca2+concentrations; Pmc1p plays a minimal role under these conditions (17Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P. Fu L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In contrast, Pmc1p appears to be critical for long term Ca2+ tolerance, because vcx1Δ mutants are relatively tolerant of extended exposure to elevated extracellular [Ca2+] but pmc1Δ mutants are Ca2+-sensitive (16Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 18Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. J.

How loss of Ca2+ homeostasis contributes to the conditional lethality of vma mutants is only partially understood. V-ATPase activity drives H+/Ca2+ exchange by Vcx1p in vitro (19Pozos T.C. Sekler I. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Ohsumi Y. Anraku Y. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 316: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) has been attributed to loss of activity of this exchanger. There are additional complexities in the role of the V-ATPase in Ca2+ homeostasis, however. The calcium sensitivity ofvma mutants is much more severe than that of vcx1mutants (8Ohya Y. Umemoto N. Tanida I. Ohta A. Iida H. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13971-13977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3730-3741Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). vma mutants also exhibit synthetic lethality with calcineurin mutants (24Garrett-Engele P. Moilanen B. Cyert M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4103-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 25Tanida I. Hasegawa A. Iida H. Ohya Y. Anraku Y J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and treatment with calcineurin inhibitors aggravates both the pH and Ca2+sensitivity of vma mutants (25Tanida I. Hasegawa A. Iida H. Ohya Y. Anraku Y J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10113-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Either elevated Ca2+ or elevated pH could induce morphological defects invma4–1 ts mutants at the non-permissive temperature, suggesting that control of cytoplasmic pH and Ca2+ might be essential for a common set of processes (12Zhang J.W. Parra K.J. Liu J. Kane P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 267: 9773-9778Google Scholar). From this and other results, it is clear that the Ca2+ and pH sensitivity ofvma mutants are linked, and this may reflect important links between cytosolic pH and Ca2+ homeostasis. In this work we have addressed the calcium-related aspects of the Vma−phenotype by comparing how cellular response to a brief Ca2+ challenge is affected by an acute loss of V-ATPase activity (in a temperature-sensitive vma mutant or in wild-type cells treated with concanamycin A) or a chronic loss of V-ATPase activity (in a vma deletion mutant). We have investigated how extracellular pH modifies calcium responses ofvma mutants and assessed the significance of alternative mechanisms of vacuolar acidification in supporting Ca2+homeostasis. Finally, we have begun to address how other transport systems may help compensate for loss of the V-ATPase (17Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P. Fu L. Bedwell D.M.

(26Yamashiro C.T. Kane P.M. Wolczyk D.F. Preston R.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3737-3749Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), except that 50 mm MES and 20 mmMPOS was used to buffer YEPD (yeast extract-peptone-2% dextrose) plates to pH 7.5 when the medium contained 60 mmCaCl2. Bacterial strains were grown on standard media (29Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). A pEVP11-based plasmid containing a functional apoaequorin gene (pAEQ; a gift from Patrick Masson, University of Wisconsin-Madison) was transformed into yeast using theLEU2 gene as a selectable marker (30Batiza A.F. Schulz T Masson P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23357-23362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The measurement of cytosolic free [Ca2+] was carried out with modifications as described previously (17Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P. Fu L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells containing the pAEQ plasmid were grown overnight at 28 °C on SD-leucine medium (fully supplemented minimal medium lacking leucine) and were harvested in the exponential phase. Cells were than diluted to anA600 of 0.15 into YEPD, pH 5.0, and allowed to double twice. Temperature-sensitive mutants were incubated at both the restrictive (37 °C) and permissive (28 °C) temperatures. 5A600 units of cells were resuspended in 0.1 ml of aequorin test medium, which consisted of SD medium containing 2 mm EGTA and 50 mm sodium succinate/50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.8. To convert the apoaequorin to aequorin, 5 μl of 590 μmcoelenterazine (dissolved in methanol) was added, and the cells were incubated for 20 min at room temperature on a rocker. They were then centrifuged briefly in a microcentrifuge, and the supernatant containing the excess coelenterazine was removed. The cells were washed in 0.5 ml of aequorin test medium and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of test medium and incubated at room temperature for another 20 min on a rocker before initiating the experiment. Aequorin-dependent light emission was measured for 10 s to determine the basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels. CaCl2 was then added in a pulse to a final concentration of 50 mm. This calcium addition was calculated to give free ionized [Ca2+] concentrations of 35.5 mm at pH 5.0, 30.8 mm at pH 5.8, and 20.4 mm at pH 7.5 in the aequorin test buffer, using the Bound and Determined program (31Brooks S.O.H. Storey K.B. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 119-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels were recorded for an additional 2–10 min. A Berthold 9050 Lumat luminometer was used to collect data at 1-s intervals. To determine the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ using the aequorin reporter system, the total amount of reconstituted aequorin available for light emission and the relationship between Ca2+ concentration and light emission (32Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1976; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar) were determined. The total amount of reconstituted aequorin was determined routinely in a crude extract of each strain by measuring the maximum light emission (Lmax) value in the presence of a saturating Ca2+ pulse. To prepare the crude extract, 2 A600 units of cells in aequorin standard buffer (50 mm sodium succinate/50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 2 mm EDTA pH 5.8, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) was lysed by agitation in the presence of 4 mg/ml Zymolyase 100 T at room temperature. After 25 min, the lysate was spun at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 3 min. The supernatant served as the extract for the luminescence assay. TheLmax value was generally between 1.5 and 2.0 × 106 relative light units/s. To determine the relationship between the free [Ca2+] and aequorin-dependent light emission, a standard curve was prepared using a cell lysate as described previously (32Allen D.G. Blinks J.R. Prendergast F.G. Science. 1976; 195: 996-998Crossref Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Briefly, increasing concentrations of CaCl2 were added to a crude extract of wild-type cells (SF838-5Aα and SEY6210) prepared in aequorin standard buffer. To determine the cytosolic [Ca2+] within intact cells, both the Lobserved in intact cells and the Lmax emission observed in a crude extract of the same cells were determined. The ratio between these values (L:Lmax) was then used to estimate the cytosolic free [Ca2+] from the standard curves. In no case was the L value in an experiment greater than 2–3% of the Lmaxvalue. Thus, the absolute amount of reconstituted aequorin was not limiting in the experiments. Cells containing the pAEQ plasmid were grown overnight at 25 °C on SD-leucine medium and harvested in exponential phase. Cells were then diluted to A600 0.15 into the same medium at 28 °C and allowed to double twice. Apoaequorin was converted to aequorin. Cells were incubated and washed as described above then resuspended in test medium containing 300 nm or 1 μm concanamycin A in 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide and incubated at room temperature for another 20 min on a rocker before initiating the experiment. As a control for membrane lesion effects, an additional sample was incubated in test medium containing 1% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Cells were diluted into YEPD, pH 5.0, as described and preincubated for 30 min at 28 °C. The culture was then supplemented with 50 μg/ml cyclosporin A, and cells were allowed to double twice. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the Ca2+ reporter assay was performed as described. Cells growing exponentially in YEPD, pH 5.0, medium (A600 = 0.6) were shifted to aequorin test buffer at pH 5.0 or 7.5 (see above) and pulsed with 50 mm CaCl2. The culture was then diluted 100-fold into aequorin test buffer at pH 5.0 or 7.5, respectively, and 100 μl of the cell suspension was spread on YEPD, pH 5.0, plates. After an incubation for 20 h at 30 °C, colonies were counted. All measurements were performed in duplicate and averaged. We initially examined the viability of vmamutants after exposure to a brief Ca2+ challenge at different extracellular pH. To minimize adaptation of cells to the loss of V-ATPase activity, we determined viability and Ca2+response in a temperature-sensitive strain (vma4-1 ts ) in which the Vma− phenotype can be induced by a simple temperature shift from 28 to 37 °C. Exponentially growing cells were transferred to SD-leucine medium supplemented with 2 mm EGTA (aequorin test buffer) at pH 5.0 or 7.5, subjected to a brief CaCl2 pulse (50 mm), then spread on YEPD plates buffered to pH 5.0 and incubated at 30 °C for 20 h. Without a Ca2+ shock, growth was comparable for the vma4-1 ts mutant grown at 28 °C at either pH 5.0 or 7.5 (Fig. 1 A). After being exposed to a brief Ca2+ shock, no growth inhibition was observed for thevma4-1 ts mutant grown at 28 °C at pH 5.0. However, viability of the vma4-1 ts mutant grown at 28 °C and shocked at pH 7.5 was reduced by 60% after the Ca2+ pulse. Without a Ca2+ shock, incubation at 37 °C reduced viability of the cells by 66% at pH 5.0 and by 87% at pH 7.5, respectively. After exposure to a brief increase in extracellular Ca2+, viability of the mutants shocked at pH 5.0 was further compromised, whereas growth of the cells pulsed in a medium buffered to pH 7.5 was completely inhibited (Fig. 1 A). To better understand how high Ca2+ levels inhibited growth of the acute vma mutants and how Ca2+-dependent growth inhibition was related to extracellular pH, we monitored the cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels in vma4-1 ts cells before and after a Ca2+ challenge at pH 5.0 or 7.5 (Fig. 1 B). Cytosolic free [Ca2+] was directly monitored using transgenic aequorin as an in vivo Ca2+ reporter system (33Nakajima-Shimada J. Iida H. Tsuji F.I. Anraku Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6878-6882Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in YEPD medium buffered to pH 5.0, harvested, and resuspended in aequorin test buffer (17Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aiello D.P. Fu L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent bioluminescence was measured for 5 s to determine basal cytosolic [Ca2+]. The resting cytosolic[Ca2+] of the vma4-1 ts mutant at 28 °C was in the 80–85 nm range at either pH 5.0 or 7.5. To examine the response to a Ca2+ challenge, 50 mm CaCl2 was injected into the cell suspension (Fig. 1 B), and the restored post-shock cytosolic [Ca2+] were determined after 2 min. Thevma4-1 ts cells grown at 28 °C quickly recovered after the Ca2+ shock at either pH reaching a new steady-state level of 85–90 nm. In contrast, basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels in the vma4-1 ts cells incubated at 37 °C were significantly higher than in the cells grown at permissive temperature, ranging from 110 to 120 nm(Fig. 1 B). The post-shock level of 125 nmCa2+ in the mutant shocked at pH 5.0 was only slightly elevated, indicating that the Vma− strain at low pH was still able to regulate its cytosolic Ca2+ levels fairly efficiently. In contrast, post-shock cytosolic [Ca2+] in the Vma− cells at pH 7.5 decreased to a level of only 140 nm (Fig. 1 B). These results indicate that, at elevated pH, the ability to compensate for loss of V-ATPase activity is more strongly compromised than at low pH. The elevated basal levels of cytosolic Ca2+ may partially account for loss of viability in vma mutants, but a calcium pulse can further compromise viability even under conditions where there is minimal effect on the post-shock cytosolic [Ca2+]. To further analyze the function of the V-ATPase in response to a brief Ca2+ shock and its relationship to the external pH, we monitored the kinetics of the cytosolic Ca2+ response to an extracellular Ca2+ pulse in wild-type cells and avma2Δ mutant. The wild-type cells routinely exhibited a resting free cytosolic [Ca2+] of 90–95 nmwhether the pH of the aequorin test buffer was pH 5.0 or 7.5 (Fig. 2 A). However, the recovery profile after the Ca2+ pulse differed at the two pH values. For wild-type cells at low external pH, cytosolic [Ca2+] increased rapidly after injection of 50 mmCaCl2 and reached a peak level corresponding to ∼230 nm cytosolic [Ca2+] within 5 s (Fig. 2 A). The [Ca2+] decreased rapidly thereafter and returned to a new steady-state free cytosolic [Ca2+] of ∼95 nm within 60 s. At pH 7.5, however, the response of wild-type cells to the Ca2+ shock showed a biphasic profile. Light emission increased rapidly and reached a peak level corresponding to ∼230 nm cytosolic Ca2+within 5 s (Fig. 2 A). Recovery occurred in two steps, suggesting a very fast removal of the cytosolic Ca2+ within the first 10 s after the pulse to ∼140 nm and a much more gradual removal of excess cytosolic Ca2+ to a new steady state of 100 nm within 70 s after the pulse. Because of differential effects of buffering ions in the medium, a 50 mm CaCl2 pulse delivers 35 mm free ionized Ca2+ at pH 5 and 20 mm at pH 7.5. To test whether the different Ca2+ profiles were an effect of the different free external [Ca2+] at pH 5.0 and pH 7.5 or a genuine pH effect, we administered a 20 mmCa2+ pulse, delivering a free ionized [Ca2+] of 12.2 mm, at pH 5.0. A similar recovery profile was obtained at pH 5.0 for a 20 mm and 50 mmCaCl2 pulse, distinct from the profile at pH 7.5 (data not shown). We next examined the response of strains carrying thevma2Δ mutation to Ca2+ shock to further define the role of the V-ATPase in short term Ca2+ recovery. In the experiment shown in Fig. 2 B, the initial resting cytosolic Ca2+ was ∼120 and ∼130 nm at pH 5.0 and 7.5, respectively, 1.4-fold higher than the wild-type strain. When the vma2Δ strain was exposed to Ca2+shock at low pH, the maximum cytosolic [Ca2+] was lower than observed in the wild-type strain and corresponded to a peak cytosolic [Ca2+] of 180 nm, reached within 20 s after the pulse. In other experiments (for example, Fig. 4 B) peak cytosolic Ca2+ levels comparable to the wild-type were observed. Recovery was always much more gradual than observed for the wild-type cells, reaching a new steady-state level of cytosolic Ca2+ of 145 nm after 2 min (Fig. 2 B). At elevated environmental pH (pH 7.5), injection of 50 mm CaCl2 generated a very steep spike of cytosolic [Ca2+], corresponding to a maximum concentration of ∼280 nm within 5 s (Fig. 2 A). As in wild-type cells, recovery occurred in 2 steps, a very fast removal of the peak [Ca2+] within the first 10 s after the pulse to ∼ 180 nm and a slow incomplete removal of further cytosolic Ca2+ to a new steady state of 150 nm within 100 s after the pulse (Fig. 2 B). Similar results were obtained in avma3Δ strain (data not shown). In general, the absolute peak values for cytosolic [Ca2+] after a pulse were more variable between experiments for the vma mutants than for the wild-type cells. The shapes of the recovery curves were very consistent, however. Wild-type and vma2Δ strains were spread on YEPD, pH 5.0, plates to test the viability of the cells after the Ca2+insult (Fig. 2 C). Neither environmental pH nor a Ca2+ pulse affected viability of the wild-type cells. Comparison to the results with the vma4-1 ts mutant (Fig. 1 A) suggests that the mutant is more sensitive to Ca2+ at pH 7.5 than wild-type cells, even at the permissive temperature. (Possible reasons for this difference are described under “Discussion.”) Viability of the vma2Δ mutants was strongly compromised by the Ca2+ challenge even at pH 5 (Fig. 2 C), however, as observed for thevma4-1 ts mutants (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, the results indicate that strains carrying thevma2Δ mutation are defective in regulation of basal cytosolic Ca2+ levels after a brief Ca2+ insult and that V-ATPase activity is essential for proper Ca2+homeostasis even at low pH. As outlined above, loss of V-ATPase activity invma2Δ mutants and even in the vma4-1 ts mutant might promote compensatory mechanisms. To test this possibility, we examined the Ca2+ response in wild-type cells in the presence of varied concentrations of concanamycin A, a rapid and specific inhibitor of the V-ATPase (34Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3902-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells were incubated for 20 min with the inhibitor. CaCl2 was then injected to a concentration of 50 mm, delivering a free ionized [Ca2+] of 30.8 mm at pH 5.8. After the Ca2+ challenge, bioluminescence was recorded for 10 min (Fig. 3 A), and cell viability was assessed in parallel (Fig. 3 B). We found that treatment of cells with either 300 nm or 1 μmconcanamycin A caused the peak cytosolic Ca2+ level in the wild-type strain to increase from ∼260 to ∼350 nm. Recovery and viability differed between the 300 nm and 1 μm concanamycin A t"

Bioessays. 1995; 17: 491-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling is mediated by a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+, either by Ca2+ release from intracellular stores or Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space. In non-excitable cells the primary Ca2+ influx pathway is store-operated calcium entry (SOCE)1 (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). SOCE is activated in response to depletion of intracellular calcium stores and has been implicated in several cellular processes, including T-cell activation (3Serafini A. Lewis R.S. Clipstone N.A.

Lewis R.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 365-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). However the mechanism(s) coupling store depletion to SOCE activation remain unknown. The following three models have been proposed: “physical coupling,” “diffusible messenger,” and “vesicle fusion.” The physical coupling hypothesis proposes that SOCE channels couple directly to a Ca2+ sensor on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, possibly the IP3 receptor, in analogy to the dihydropyridine-ryanodine receptor interaction in skeletal muscle (8Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 9Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 10Rosado J.A. Jenner S. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7527-7533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Whereas the diffusible messenger hypothesis argues that store depletion results in the generation of a diffusible messenger that opens SOCE channels (11Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (783) Google Scholar, 12Gilon P. Bird G.S. Bian X. Yakel J.L. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Marchase R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), the vesicle fusion model proposes that SOCE channels are inserted in the plasma membrane following store depletion (14Somasundaram B. Norman J.C. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 725-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although there is some evidence for each model (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar), it is not yet clear what the coupling mechanism is and whether SOCE is activated by the same mechanism in different cell types. Despite the importance and ubiquitous nature of Ca2+signaling pathways, their role and regulation during the cell cycle remain controversial. Probably the clearest example of a Ca2+ requirement during the cell cycle is at fertilization, where a Ca2+ signal is necessary and sufficient for egg activation and the initiation of embryonic development (15Miyazaki S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 235-251PubMed Google Scholar, 16Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 211: 157-176Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Oocytes of both Xenopus and mammals are arrested at the G2–M transition of the cell cycle (15Miyazaki S. CIBA Found. Symp. 1995; 188: 235-251PubMed Google Scholar, 17Smith L.D. Development. 1989; 107: 685-699PubMed Google Scholar). Before such oocytes become competent to be fertilized and able to support embryonic development, they undergo a maturation process called meiotic (or oocyte) maturation. During this maturation period oocytes enter meiosis, complete the first meiotic division with the extrusion of a polar body, and arrest at metaphase of the second meiotic division (metaphase II) (17Smith L.D. Development. 1989; 107: 685-699PubMed Google Scholar). Cells remain arrested at metaphase II until fertilization, which relieves the metaphase II block and induces the completion of meiosis and entry into the mitotic cell cycle. In all animals studied, fertilization induces a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels that underlies most of the early events of egg activation (16Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 2000; 211: 157-176Crossref Scopus (572) Google Scholar). Henceforth, we will refer to immature stage VIXenopus oocytes arrested at G2–M as “oocytes” and cells after meiotic maturation (arrested at metaphase II) as “eggs.” In this report we show that SOCE becomes uncoupled from Ca2+ store content following meiotic maturation. In other words, store depletion in eggs does not activate SOCE. This shows that SOCE can be regulated independently of calcium load in the stores. We have further determined the time course of SOCE down-regulation during meiosis and show that SOCE inactivates acutely at the germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) stage. Oocytes were isolated as described previously (20Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Eggs were matured in vitro by incubation in 5 μg/ml progesterone. Xenopusoocytes or eggs were voltage clamped with two microelectrodes by the use of a GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments). Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 1–2 megohms. Voltage stimulation and data acquisition were controlled using either pClamp8 (Axon Instruments) or Curcap30 (developed by Bill Goolsby, Emory University). Confocal Ca2+ imaging was performed using an Olympus Fluoview confocal scanning system fitted to an IX70 microscope using a × 10 (0.3 numerical aperature) objective. Images (256 × 256 pixels) were collected and analyzed using Olympus Fluoview software. Oocyte capacitance was measured by administering 4 consecutive voltage steps from a −40-mV holding potential to −30 mV for 50 ms each. Capacitive current decay was averaged and fitted by a single exponential. Membrane capacitance (Cm) was calculated as follows: Cm = τ (1/Ra + Gm). τ is the time constant obtained from the exponential fit. Rais the access resistance and was calculated as follows: Ra= Vp/I0. Vp is the applied voltage pulse (10 mV), and I0 is the instantaneous current obtained by extrapolating the experimental fit to time 0. Gm was calculated as follows : Gm = Iss/(Vp − Ra*Iss). Iss is the steady state current following relaxation of the capacitive transient (18Takahashi A. Watkins S.C. Howard M. Frizzell R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C1887-C1894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Neher E. Marty A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6712-6716Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in 100% methanol and incubated overnight at −20 °C. Oocytes were bisected in half and incubated in 1:250 dilution of DM1A, an anti-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Sigma) in Tris-buffered saline containing 2% bovine serum albumin for 16 h. After several washes cells were incubated in 1:100 dilution of a fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Sigma) for 16 h. Oocytes were washed, dehydrated, stained in 5 μg/ml propidium iodide, and cleared in benzyl alcohol:benzyl benzoate (1:2) before confocal imaging. MPF kinase activity was measured by lysing 5 oocytes in 100 μl of extraction buffer (80 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 20 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C until use in the kinase assay. The H1 kinase assay to measure MPF activity was performed using the SignaTECT™ kinase kit (Promega). We have studied the regulation of SOCE during Xenopusoocyte meiotic maturation. As in most non-excitable cells, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores in Xenopus oocytes activates SOCE. We have recently developed a protocol to image SOCE inXenopus oocytes (20Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Ca2+ release and SOCE are temporally separated by recording Ca2+ levels using confocal imaging in voltage-clamped cells stepped sequentially to +40 and −140 mV (Fig. 1 A). Ca2+ release from stores is independent of plasma membrane voltage and occurs at both +40 and −140 mV, whereas Ca2+influx occurs only at −140 mV because of the larger driving force (20Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows representative three-dimensional rendition images of Ca2+ release and SOCE in oocytes. Ca2+ release was triggered by IP3 injection (2 pmol), which induces a sweeping wave of Ca2+ release. Initially, Ca2+ release is observed at the site of IP3 injection (Fig. 1 A, i) and slowly spreads through the entire cytoplasm (Fig. 1 A,ii). Following store depletion SOCE becomes apparent as Ca2+ influx at −140 mV (Fig. 1 A,iii). The time course of development of Ca2+fluorescence over the confocal section at +40 (squares) and −140mV (circles) is shown in Fig. 1 B. IP3 injection induces Ca2+ release from stores and a steep increase in Ca2+ fluorescence at both voltages, followed by a slow decay to baseline. During the decay phase, Ca2+ fluorescence becomes gradually higher at −140 (circles) than at +40mV (squares) (Fig. 1 B). The difference in Ca2+ fluorescence between images at −140 and +40 mV provides a measure of the extent of Ca2+ entry in response to store depletion, thus SOCE (Fig. 1 D, blue triangles).Figure 1Imaging SOCE. Albino oocytes were loaded with Ca-green-1 coupled to 70-kD dextran (7 μm) and voltage clamped from a holding potential of 0 to +40 then −140 mV for 1 s each as shown in A. Confocal images were collected 300 msec into each voltage pulse. A, representative three-dimensional images of Ca2+ release at +40 mV (I and ii) and Ca2+ influx at −140 mV (iii). Although the images in panels iand ii were taken at +40 mV, identical images were obtained in the following −140-mV voltage pulse: panels i,ii, and iii were taken 10 s, 2 min, and 10 min, respectively, after IP3 injection. Scale bar is 150 μm. B and C, Ca2+fluorescence (FCa) over time at +40 and −140 mV from an oocyte (B) and an egg (C). Theinset in C shows superimposed traces of Ca2+ fluorescence on an expanded scale from an oocyte (blue trace) and an egg (red trace). This illustrates the slower Ca2+ release kinetics in eggs.D, SOCE in eggs (n = 10) and oocytes (n = 3). SOCE was calculated as the difference between FCa at −140 and +40 mV. Eggs were matured in 5 μg/ml progesterone. The external solution was 123 mmNaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study SOCE in eggs, we induced meiotic maturation with progesterone (5 μg/ml) and imaged SOCE as described above. Interestingly, store depletion does not activate SOCE in eggs (Fig. 1, C andD). IP3 injection induces Ca2+release from stores, but in contrast to oocytes (Fig. 1 B), no Ca2+ influx is observed at −140 mV (circles) up to 30 min after IP3 injection (Fig. 1, C andD). Furthermore, the dynamics of Ca2+ release were significantly different following oocyte maturation. Injection of IP3 in eggs results in a slower and more prolonged Ca2+ release wave. Ca2+ release is defined as the time from the initial observation of the Ca2+ wave in the focal plane until peak Ca2+ fluorescence. This time was significantly shorter (p < 0.00012) in oocytes (36.67 ± 12.01 s; n = 3) versus eggs (167.5 ± 11.29 s; n = 8). An example of the time required to reach maximum Ca2+ fluorescence for an oocyte (blue trace) and an egg (red trace) is shown in the inset of Fig. 1 C. In addition, half-time of decay of cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels, from peak Ca2+ fluorescence to half-maximal value, was significantly slower (p < 0.037) in eggs (305 ± 58.88 s;n = 8) (Fig. 1 C) as compared with oocytes (60 ± 11.54 s; n = 3) (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 D shows a summary of SOCE activation in oocytes and eggs from the same donor female. Whereas oocytes exhibit a robust SOCE signal (t12= 4.3 min; see Fig. 1 D, blue triangles), no SOCE activity is detected in eggs up to 20 min after Ca2+ release (Fig. 1 D, green triangles). These data suggest that the coupling between store Ca2+ load and SOCE activation is somehow disrupted during oocyte maturation. This could be due to either the inactivation of SOCE channels or the inhibition of the coupling mechanism between store depletion and SOCE. Ca2+ release in eggs results in cortical granule (CG) exocytosis, which releases several enzymes that modify proteins on the egg surface and induces the slow block to polyspermy (21Grey R.D. Wolf D.P. Hedrick J.L. Dev. Biol. 1974; 36: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). SOCE channels could be a target for these enzymes, which would explain SOCE inactivation in eggs. To test this possibility, we injected eggs with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA to inhibit a rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ following store depletion. We confirmed that BAPTA injection inhibits CG exocytosis by assessing the appearance of the fertilization envelope (Fig. 2).Xenopus eggs are surrounded by a vitelline envelope that is in tight proximity with the cell membrane. Release of CG content creates a space between the vitelline and cell membranes called the fertilization envelope (21Grey R.D. Wolf D.P. Hedrick J.L. Dev. Biol. 1974; 36: 44-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). Egg activation with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin (10 μm) results in Ca2+ release and the elevation of the fertilization envelope within ∼2 min (Fig. 2). In contrast, no fertilization envelope was detected in BAPTA-injected eggs as long as 15 min after egg activation with ionomycin (Fig. 2). This shows that BAPTA was effective in buffering cytoplasmic Ca2+ and inhibiting CG fusion. To assess whether SOCE can be detected when CG fusion is inhibited, we were interested in measuring SOCE in BAPTA-injected eggs. Because BAPTA injection precludes measuring SOCE by imaging, we recorded the SOCE current (Isoce) directly as described by Yao and Tsien (22Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Stage VI Xenopus oocytes exhibited a prominent SOCE current in response to store depletion (Fig. 3). Isoce was measured using a ramp voltage from −140 to +60 mV applied to oocytes preinjected with BAPTA once every 30 s (Fig. 3 A). We depleted Ca2+ stores by IP3 injection and followed the development of SOCE by monitoring the inward current at −140 mV (Fig. 3 B). As described previously (22Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), Isocewas measured as the La3+-inhibited current induced in response to store depletion (Fig. 3, B–D). The Isoce current-voltage relationship (I-V) had the typical inward rectifying character (Fig. 3 D), as described by others (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar, 22Yao Y. Tsien R.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We further determined the I-V of the SOCE current using a step voltage protocol, which resulted in a similar inward rectifying curve (data not shown). When we attempted to record Isoce from Xenopuseggs preinjected with BAPTA using the same protocol outlined above, in agreement with our imaging data, no SOCE current could be detected following depletion of Ca2+ stores with either ionomycin or IP3 (Fig. 4,A–C). In contrast Ca2+ store depletion in oocytes from the same donor female induced a prominent Isoce (Fig. 4, A–C). This shows that SOCE inactivates specifically during Xenopus oocyte meiosis, independently of CG fusion. To determine whether other membrane currents are down-regulated in eggs, we measured the activity of Ca-activated chloride currents (ICl, Ca) following meiotic maturation (Fig. 4,D–F). Hartzell (23Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 157-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) described two ICl, Ca inXenopus oocytes, ICl1 and ICl2. ICl1 responds to Ca2+ release from stores, whereas ICl2 responds only to Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space but not Ca2+ release. ICl1 has an outward rectifying I-V and is therefore activated at depolarizing voltages (+40 mV). In contrast ICl2 exhibits an inward rectifying I-V and is measured at hyperpolarizing voltages (−140 mV) (Fig. 4 D). We measured the development of ICl1 and ICl2 in oocytes and eggs voltage clamped using the protocol shown in Fig. 4 D. In oocytes, ICl1 activates following IP3 injection in response to Ca2+ release from stores (20Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D, squares). As Ca2+ stores become depleted ICl1 returns to baseline. Ca2+ influx through SOCE channels following store depletion slowly activates ICl2 (20Machaca K. Hartzell H.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 249-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 D, circles). The activation of the calcium-activated chloride currents in response to IP3 injection was very different in eggs (Fig. 4 E). As expected from SOCE inactivation in eggs, ICl2 was not activated following store depletion (Fig. 4 E, circles), whereas ICl1 activated in response to Ca2+ release was significantly larger and more prolonged in eggs (Fig. 4 E, squares). These changes in the ICl1 response are most likely due to the altered Ca2+ release dynamics in eggs (see Fig. 1 C). Nonetheless, these data show that ICl1 is not down-regulated during meiotic maturation. ICl, Ca is required for the fast electrical block to polyspermy at fertilization (24Grey R.D. Bastiani M.J. Webb D.J. Schertel E.R. Dev. Biol. 1982; 89: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). It is therefore critical that this current remains active in eggs. The inactivation of SOCE, but not ICl, Ca, shows that oocytes differentially regulate membrane currents during maturation to generate developmentally competent eggs. Oocyte maturation in Xenopus induces a gradual decrease in plasma membrane surface area (see Fig. 6 A), which is responsible for the down-regulation of plasma membrane Na+-K+-ATPase (25Schmalzing G. Eckard P. Kroner S. Passow H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C179-C184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vasilets L.A. Schmalzing G. Madefessel K. Haase W. Schwarz W. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To determine whether SOCE channels are subject to the same regulation, we correlated Isoce levels with the different phases of meiosis (see Figs. 5 and 6). We followed the progression of meiosis by tracking the nuclear cycle after progesterone addition. Oocytes were stained for tubulin (anti-tubulin antibody) and DNA (propidium iodide) (Fig. 5 a). From the time of progesterone addition until GVBD, the nuclear envelope is intact with no DNA condensation (Fig. 5 a, A). GVBD is easily monitored by the appearance of a white spot on the animal hemisphere (17Smith L.D. Development. 1989; 107: 685-699PubMed Google Scholar). White spot appearance correlated nicely with actual GVBD in experiments similar to the one represented by Fig. 5 a (data not shown). At GVBD, the chromosomes are readily apparent, but they are still spread over a relatively large area, and the spindle is not formed (Fig. 5 a, B). During the 2.5–3 h following GVBD, oocytes complete meiosis I (Fig. 5 a, C–F), enter meiosis II, and arrest at metaphase II (Fig. 5 a, G–I).Figure 5Stages of meiosis. a, oocytes were fixed at different time points after progesterone addition and stained with propidium iodide to visualize the chromosomes and an anti-tubulin antibody to visualize the structure of the spindle.A, germinal vesicle intact oocytes, before GVBD.B, GVBD as indicated by a white spot on the animal hemisphere.

Time 0 refers to GVBD as indicated by thearrow.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is also possible to follow the progression of meiosis by measuring MPF kinase activity, which cycles during meiosis with peak activity at metaphase (17Smith L.D. Development. 1989; 107: 685-699PubMed Google Scholar). We measured p34cdc2 kinase activity during oocyte maturation from the same batch of cells on which we performed immunofluorescence (Fig. 5 b). MPF activity is maximal at GVBD and decreases between meiosis I and meiosis II before peaking again at metaphase II (Fig. 5 b). To determine the time course of SOCE inactivation during meiotic maturation, we recorded Isoce at different time points during the maturation process, from the same batch of cells on which we performed immunofluorescence and measured MPF activity. The experiment was repeated three times with cells from different females. The time from progesterone addition until GVBD varied between different batches of cells. We therefore normalized the data such that one time unit is defined as the time from progesterone addition until 50% of the cells undergo GVBD (GVBD50) (27Wasserman W.J. Masui Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1975; 91: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We recorded both Isoce (Fig. 6 B) and membrane capacitance (Fig. 6 A) to obtain a measure of membrane surface area and Isoce density (Fig. 6 C). This analysis resulted in the dramatic finding that SOCE inactivates over a very narrow time period (<15 min) right at GVBD. Isoce was always present in every cell we recorded from before GVBD (n = 21), at similar levels to Isoce in oocytes (Fig. 6 B, Early andLate No GVBD). We recorded from cells after progesterone addition as early as 0.21 up to 1.3 GVBD50, with no decrease in Isoce levels. During that time membrane capacitance decreases by ∼20% (Fig. 6 A), resulting in higher Isoce density in the cells that are delayed in undergoing GVBD (Late No GVBD) (Fig. 6 C). However, as soon as GVBD occurs, Isoce is no longer detectable (Fig. 6 B, GVBD). Cells were checked for GVBD every 5 min, and we recorded Isoce ∼5 min after GVBD. Therefore within approximately 15 min Isoceinactivates almost completely (Fig. 6 B). This is quite remarkable considering that meiotic maturation, from progesterone addition until metaphase II, requires 7–12 h depending on the batch of oocytes. After GVBD, Isoce remains inactivated throughout oocyte maturation until metaphase II. We measured Isoce at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 5 h after GVBD (n = 24) and never observed any Isoce activity. These data show that Isoce inactivates at GVBD and remains inactivated through the completion of oocyte maturation. It is unlikely that SOCE inactivation is due to membrane internalization during meiotic maturation, because there is no correlation between membrane area (Fig. 6 A) and SOCE levels (Fig. 6 B). Whereas membrane area decreases gradually after progesterone addition, SOCE inactivates acutely at GVBD. The Na+-K+-ATPase has also been shown to be down-regulated during meiotic maturation because of sequestration into intracellular vesicles (25Schmalzing G. Eckard P. Kroner S. Passow H. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C179-C184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Vasilets L.A. Schmalzing G. Madefessel K. Haase W. Schwarz W. J. Membr. Biol. 1990; 118: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In this case Na+-K+-ATPase activity begins to decrease gradually after progesterone addition, even before GVBD, and continues after GVBD has occurred (28Richter H.P. Jung D. Passow H. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Furthermore complete down-regulation of the Na+-K+-ATPase requires almost 2 h (28Richter H.P. Jung D. Passow H. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 79: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This is in sharp contrast to the rapid and complete inactivation of SOCE at GVBD (Fig. 6 B). MPF activity is maximal at GVBD (Fig. 5 b). It is therefore tempting to propose that MPF plays a role in SOCE inactivation. However, SOCE current does not cycle in tandem with MPF activity during the later stages of meiosis (see Figs. 5 b and6 B). Whereas MPF kinase activity declines between meiosis I and II, SOCE remains undetectable throughout this transition (Fig. 6 B). Although this does not rule out a direct role for MPF in the initial inactivation of SOCE, it suggests that other mechanism(s) are involved in maintaining SOCE inactivation. The regulation of membrane proteins during the cell cycle is not unique to SOCE. Several currents have been shown to be cell cycle-dependent. In mouse embryos K+currents are present during M and G1 but not S and G2 (30Day M.L. Pickering S.J. Johnson M.H. Cook D.I. Nature. 1993; 365: 560-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), and in ascidian embryos an inward rectifying Cl− current has been shown to fluctuate with the cell cycle (31Coombs J.L. Villaz M. Moody W.J. Dev. Biol. 1992; 153: 272-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In addition, cell cycle regulation of exogenously expressed channel proteins in Xenopus oocytes has been reported. The rat ether-a-go-go K+ channel alters its voltage dependence during meiotic maturation through an MPF-mediated process (32Pardo L.A. Bruggemann A. Camacho J. Stuhmer W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, to our knowledge, none of these currents exhibit a similar regulation to the rapid and complete inactivation observed for SOCE. This argues that SOCE inactivation is regulated by distinct mechanisms. Furthermore, SOCE might be down-regulated during mitosis in mammalian cells (29Preston S.F. Sha'afi R.I. Berlin R.D. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), arguing that SOCE inactivation could potentially be a universal phenomenon during M phase. Although at this point we do not know the mechanism controlling SOCE inactivation, anyone of the aforementioned coupling mechanisms could be disrupted during meiosis leading to SOCE inactivation. However, because vesicle trafficking is down-regulated during mitosis (33Warren G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 323-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we favor the idea that SOCE inactivation during oocyte maturation is because of disruption of vesicle fusion.

The major vegetative catalase A (CatA) is induced by H2O2 and is required for efficient aerobic growth. In order to investigate the H2O2-dependent regulatory mechanism, an H2O2-resistant mutant (HR40) overproducing CatA was isolated from S. coelicolor A3(2). Based on the genetic map location of the mutated locus in HR40, the wild type catR gene was isolated from the ordered cosmid library of S. coelicolor by screening for its ability to suppress the HR40 phenotype. catR encodes a protein of 138 amino acids (15319 Da), with sequence homology to ferric uptake regulator (Fur)-like proteins. Disruption of catR caused CatA overproduction as observed in the HR40 mutant, confirming the role of CatR as a negative regulator of catA expression. The levels of catA and catR transcripts were higher in HR40 than in the wild type, implying that CatR represses transcription of these genes. Transcripts from the catA andcatR genes were induced within 10 min of H2O2 treatment, suggesting that the repressor activity of CatR may be directly modulated by H2O2.

To counter the damaging effect of reactive oxygen species, cells have evolved anti-oxidant defense systems, whose expression is usually induced by reactive oxygen species and/or oxidants. Cells possess regulators that sense and transduce the oxidative signals to allow coordinated gene expression. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium, distinct responses against H2O2 and superoxide (O⨪2) are mediated by OxyR and SoxR/SoxS regulators, respectively (1Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). OxyR is an H2O2-sensing transcriptional regulator inducing more than 10 genes in response to H2O2 (2Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 3Christman M.F. Morgan R.W. Jacobson F.S. Ames B.N. Cell. 1985; 41: 753-762Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (739) Google Scholar). It is activated by disulfide bond formation between two cysteine residues, and induces the expression ofoxyS (a small, non-translated regulatory RNA),katG (hydroperoxidase I), ahpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), gorA (glutathione reductase),dps (DNA-binding protein), and grxA (glutaredoxin 1) (2Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). Glutaredoxin 1 deactivates OxyR by reducing the disulfide bond, forming an autoregulatory loop (4Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G. Science. 1998; 279: 1718-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). SoxR is activated by O⨪2 or NO via oxidation of a [2Fe-2S] center, present as a pair per dimer (5Hidalgo E. Ding H. Demple B. Cell. 1997; 88: 121-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Activated SoxR induces soxS expression, generating more SoxS protein which then activates various target genes such assodA (Mn-SOD), nfo (endonuclease IV),zwf (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), fumC(fumarase), acnA (aconitase), fpr(ferredoxin:NADPH oxidoreductase), and ribA(GTP-cyclohydrolase II) (2Storz G.

In Bacillus subtilis, where an oxyR homologue has not been identified, PerR has been proposed to mediate the H2O2- and metal-dependent induction of such genes as katA (catalase), ahpCF (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase), mrgA (nonspecific DNA-binding protein), and hemAXCDBL (heme biosynthesis operon) (7Chen L. Keramati L. Helmann J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8190-8194Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 8Bsat N. Herbig A. Casillas-Martinez L. Setlow P. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the peroxide sensing by PerR, which is a homologue of the ferric uptake regulator (Fur)1 of enteric bacteria, might be mediated via metal-catalyzed oxidation of the protein or a change in the oxidation state of the bound metal ion (8Bsat N. Herbig A. Casillas-Martinez L. Setlow P. Helmann J.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Streptomyces coelicolor, a Gram-positive aerobic soil bacterium that undergoes complex cycle of morphological and physiological differentiation, responds to H2O2by inducing about 100 proteins as judged by two-dimensional gel analysis (9Chung H.J. Roe J.H. J. Microbiol. 1993; 31: 166-174Google Scholar). It produces two monofunctional catalases (CatA and CatB) and a catalase peroxidase (CatC), among which only CatA is induced by H2O2. CatA is the major catalase required for efficient growth of mycelium and resistance against H2O2 (10Cho Y.H. Roe J.H. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4049-4052Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CatB is induced by osmotic stress or at the stationary phase, and is required for proper differentiation and osmoprotection of the cell (11Cho Y.H. Lee E.J. Roe J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). CatC is expressed transiently at late exponential to early stationary phase, and its function in vivo has not been revealed yet (12Hahn J.S. Oh S.Y. Roe J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3767-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In addition to these, it has been reported that S. coelicolor possesses two kinds of superoxide dismutases (Ni-SOD and FeZn-SOD encoded by sodNand sodF, respectively), an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system (encoded by ahpCD), and a thioredoxin system (encoded by trxBA) as oxidative defense proteins (13Kim E.J.

Three transcriptional regulation systems controlling the expression of a subset of these oxidative defense proteins have been found: an anti-ς factor RsrA which binds a cognate ς factor, ςR, in a redox-dependent manner and thus regulates ςR-dependent transcription of thetrxBA and sigR genes (16Paget M.S.

Regulation of Oxidative Stress Response by FurA, OxyR, and CatR in Streptomyces coelicolor. Ph. D. thesis. Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea1999Google Scholar); and FurA which regulates catalase peroxidase gene (catC; Ref. 12Hahn J.S. Oh S.Y. Roe J.H. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 3767-3774Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A soxR-like gene has been predicted from the sequence information (S. coelicolor Genome Project, The Sanger Center). The redox-dependent activity modulation is best described for RsrA. It binds and sequesters ςR from transcribingtrxBA and its own gene under reducing conditions. Upon oxidation by H2O2 or a thiol-oxidizer diamide, it loses its ςR binding activity, releasing ςR to transcribe its target genes. The redox-dependent modulation of RsrA activity is mediated via thiol-disulfide exchange. The induced thioredoxin, in turn, reduces RsrA, forming a negative feedback loop. This allows the homeostatic control of intracellular redox conditions by RsrA. Not much is yet known about the activity modulation of OxyR in S. coelicolornor the mechanism of H2O2-dependent induction of the major catalase. In this study, we report on the isolation and characterization of another novel redox-sensitive regulator CatR, which serves as a transcriptional repressor regulating the catA gene. S. coelicolor A3(2) J1501 was mutagenized with UV to isolate H2O2-resistant mutants (18Hahn J.S. Oh S.Y. Chater K.F. Roe J.H. J. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 18-23Google Scholar). J1915, aglkA derivative of M145 (19Kelemen G.H. Plaskitt K.A. Lewis C.G. Findlay K.C. Buttner M.J. Mol.

Streptomyces cells were grown in YEME medium for liquid culture, and on R2YE, nutrient agar (NA), or minimal medium plates for surface culture (20Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T.

E. coli ET12567, a non-methylating strain, was used to prepare DNA to transform S. coelicolor (21MacNeil D.J. Gewain K.M. Ruby C.L. Dezeny G. Gibbons P.H. MacNeil T. Gene ( Amst. ). 1992; 111: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Based on genetic mapping of the mutated locus in the H2O2-resistant mutant HR40, ordered cosmids from K13 to 2E1 (kindly provided by H. Kieser), encompassing themthB2 locus (22Redenbach M. Kieser H.M. Denapaite D. Eichner A. Cullum J. Kinashi H. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar), were tested to isolate catR. Cosmid DNAs were prepared from E. coli ET12567, and introduced into HR40 protoplasts following denaturation (23Oh S.H. Chater K.F. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 122-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cosmid-integrated clones were selected on R2YE medium containing 200 μg/ml kanamycin, and tested for their ability to repress CatA overproduction in HR40. The amount of catalase production was initially assessed by dropping 30% H2O2 on colonies and observing the intensity of bubbling caused by O2 evolution, and then confirmed by Coomassie staining of proteins in SDS-PAGE. Two overlapping cosmids, 6F2 and 7E4, which repressed catalase overproduction in HR40 were further analyzed. Restriction fragments in the overlapping region of the two cosmids were cloned into pSET152 (24Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E.

Each plasmid was used to transform E. coli ET12567, which harbors a mobilizing plasmid pUZ8002 (a kind gift from D. H. Figurski), and then transferred into HR40 by conjugation based on the method of Mazodier et al. (25Mazodier P. Petter R. Thompson C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 3583-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Exconjugants were selected with 50 μg/ml apramycin, and tested for catalase production. RNA was isolated from S. coelicolor cells grown in YEME as described previously (20Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T. Bruton C.J. Kieser H.M. Lydiate D.J. Smith C.P. Ward J.M. Schrempf H.

Cells were resuspended in Kirby mixture and disrupted by sonication with a micro tip (Sonics and Materials Inc.) at 25% of the maximum amplitude (600 W, 20 kHz) for 10 s. For mapping 5′ ends of catRtranscripts, a 270-base pair HindIII/BglII fragment of the PCR-amplified catR gene uniquely labeled with [γ−32P]ATP at the BglII site (148 nucleotides from the start codon) was prepared. S1 nuclease protection assay was done as described previously (26Smith C.P. Brown T.A. Essential Molecular Biology, a Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1991: 237-252Google Scholar). For mappingcatA transcript, a 0.6-kb SalI/BglII fragment of the catA gene uniquely labeled at theBglII site (244 nucleotides from the start codon) was used as a probe. catR was disrupted by inserting a hygromycin-resistance cassette (hyg, provided by J. Ainsa) in the middle of the gene. Plasmid pDH5 containinghyg was digested with SphI, and cloned into the same site of pIJ2925 (provided by M. Bibb). The cassette was excised as an 1.9-kb BglII fragment, and inserted into theBglII site of pJH3013 which contains a 1.2-kbHincII/BamHI fragment of catR (Fig. 2) in pUC18. The resulting plasmid pJH3013H was digested withEcoRI and HindIII, and the 3.1-kb insert was cloned into EcoRI/HindIII-cut pIJ6650 (provided by M. Paget), a pKC1132 derivative containing the glkA gene marker, resulting in pJH3083H. The plasmid pJH3083H was introduced intoE. coli ET12567 containing pUZ8002, and then transferred by conjugation into J1915, a glkA − derivative of M145. The exconjugants were selected on SFM media containing 150 μg/ml hygromycin and 50 μg/ml apramycin. The selected exconjugants were then grown under hygromycin selection, and the spores were plated on MM containing 200 mm deoxyglucose plus 150 μg/ml hygromycin. The surviving colonies, expected to have lost the vector including the counterselectable glkA by second crossover, were confirmed for apramycin sensitivity by replica plating. ThecatR disruption was then confirmed by Southern hybridization.Figure 2Identification of the catRgene repressing CatA production. A, restriction map of the 1.2-kb HincII/BamHI fragment containing catR is presented. The insert DNAs in pSET152-based recombinant plasmids pJH3113 and pJH3115 are indicated. Restriction sites marked are: BamHI (BI),BglII (BII), SmaI (Sm),HincII (HII). B, repression of CatA production by the catR gene. Plasmids pJH3113 and pJH3115 were introduced into HR40 by conjugal transfer. The catRdisruptant (JH11) and its wild type parent J1915 were analyzed in parallel. Extracts from cells grown for 40 h on NA with appropriate antibiotics were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) ThecatR coding region was amplified by PCR with mutagenic primers CRON (5′-AGGCTGATGCATATGAGTGACC-3′; NdeI site underlined) and CROB (5′-CAGGATTGGATCCTGCGACCT-3′;BamHI site underlined). The PCR product was cut withNdeI and BamHI and cloned into pET21c (Novagen) to generate pJH7. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pJH7 were grown in LB medium to A600 of 0.5 and treated with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. After harvest, cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) and disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was precipitated with 60% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was dissolved in and dialyzed against TGED buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 10% glycerol). The dialysate was subjected to chromatography on heparin-Sepharose CL-6B, Q-Sepharose, Superdex-75, and Mono-Q columns. The final eluate from Mono-Q, eluted at 0.2–0.3 m NaCl in TGED buffer, contained CatR protein at more than 90% homogeneity. Purified CatR was stored at −70 °C in 50% glycerol before use. The catR promoter region from −111 to +71 nucleotides from the start codon was generated by PCR with primers CR1 (5′-CTCTTGGCCAATGCCGCCCCGG-3′) and CRS1 (5′-TCGGCCACGACCCGCCGCTGCG-3′). The catA promoter region from −84 to +254 nucleotides from the start codon was generated by PCR with primers CAD84 (5′-AGCAGGCTTCGGCATCAATT-3′) and CAC (5′-TCGGAGAAGATCTTCGCGCTGG-3′). The PCR product was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Unincorporated isotopes were removed by centrifugation through a Sephadex G-50 spun column. The end-labeled probe (about 30,000 cpm for less than 0.1 pmol per each reaction) was incubated with 200 ng (13 pmol) of purified CatR in 20 μl of binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 40 mmKCl, 100 μg of poly(dI-dC) per ml, and 5% glycerol) at 30 °C for 10 min. The DNA/protein mixture was electrophoresed on a 5% native PAGE in 20 mm Tris borate buffer, and analyzed by autoradiography. Polyclonal antibody against purified CatR was raised in mice. The reacting signal was detected by goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase using the Western ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An H2O2-resistant mutant HR40 was generated by UV mutagenesis of spores from S. coelicolor A3(2) J1501 as described previously (18Hahn J.S. Oh S.Y. Chater K.F. Roe J.H. J. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 18-23Google Scholar). It grows as rapidly as the wild type and differentiates normally, although it produces less of the blue antibiotic, actinorhodin, than the wild type. The protein profile of HR40 was compared with that of its parent (J1501) on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 A). A prominent difference in HR40 was the overproduction of catalase A. No other significant changes in protein profile were observed. HR40 overproduced about 50-fold more CatA than the wild type as judged by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B). Measurement of the catalase activity in cell extracts also produced similar results (data not shown). Expression of other antioxidant enzymes such as catalase peroxidase (CatC) and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase system (AhpCD) was lowered in HR40 (Fig. 1 B). The level of catalase B (CatB), a stationary phase-specific catalase, did not change significantly (Fig. 1 B). Although HR40 was more resistant to H2O2 than the wild type, it was slightly sensitive to cumene hydroperoxide, consistent with the reduced expression of AhpCD. Sensitivity of HR40 against superoxide generating agents such as paraquat, plumbagin, and menadione was similar to that of J1501 (data not shown). The mutation (catR1) in HR40 had been previously mapped close to the mthB2 locus by genetic crosses (18Hahn J.S. Oh S.Y. Chater K.F. Roe J.H. J. Microbiol. 2000; 38: 18-23Google Scholar). This locus is near the center of the chromosome, being separated by more than half a genome distance from catA, which has been physically mapped to the AseI F fragment near one end of the linear chromosome (22Redenbach M. Kieser H.M. Denapaite D. Eichner A. Cullum J. Kinashi H. Hopwood D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 77-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). 2E. J. Kim and H. Kieser, personal communication. Therefore,catR is likely to encode a regulator for catalase A production, the catR1 allele giving rise to either a repressor with lost function or an activator with gained function. It has been previously suggested that catA expression may be regulated by a repressor system on the grounds that the presence ofcatA promoter fragments on a multicopy plasmid increased the production of catalase A in Streptomyces lividans. Therefore, assuming that the catR1 is a recessive loss-of-function mutation, we attempted to clone the wild typecatR by introducing into HR40 genomic DNAs from ordered cosmids spanning the mthB2 locus, screening for wild type levels of catalase production as follows: since HR40 overproduces catalase A, application of 30% H2O2 solution on top of its colonies generates the explosive evolution of O2 in contrast to mild bubbling on wild type colonies. Using this handy screening tool, we were able to select two overlapping cosmids (6F2 and 7E4) out of 23 cosmids (from K15 to 2E1) tested, as candidates harboring the catR gene. Cosmids 6F2 and 7E4 overlaps by about 21 kb. To localize catR more precisely, various restriction fragments of the overlapping region were subcloned into pSET152, a conjugation vector containing a phage integration site (att) (24Bierman M. Logan R. O'Brien K. Seno E.T. Rao R.N. Schoner B.E. Gene ( Amst .). 1992; 116: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmids were introduced into HR40 and tested for phenotype suppression. We found that a 1.2-kbHincII-BamHI fragment (in pJH3113) was able to repress catalase overproduction in HR40, whereas its subfragment (0.8-kb HincII-BglII fragment in pJH 3115) was not (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 3 and 4). This enabled us to narrow down the position of the catR gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the insert DNA in pJH3113 contained two open reading frames, one coding for a homologue of inosine-phosphate dehydrogenase and the other coding for a Fur homologue (Fig. 2 A). Since plasmid pJH3115 failed to repress mutant phenotype, it appeared that the downstream open reading frame encoding a Fur homologue is the catR gene regulatingcatA expression. To confirm the role of CatR as a repressor of catA gene expression, the catR gene in strain J1915 was disrupted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” TheΔcatR mutant (JH11) showed no defect in growth or differentiation, except that it produced a reduced amount of actinorhodin on R2YE plates as observed for HR40. As expected, JH11 overproduced CatA to an extent comparable to HR40 (Fig. 2 B, lane 6). The catRgene encodes a protein of 138 amino acids with a deduced molecular mass of 15,319 Da and close similarity to Fur-like proteins of other bacteria (Fig. 3). The closest match was found with FurV of Streptomyces venezuelae, whose gene is transcribed divergently from thebca gene encoding bromoperoxidase catalase (27Facey S.J. Gross F. Vining L.C. Yang K. van Pee K.H. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 657-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CatR also matched closely with PerR of B. subtilis. To identify the mutated residue in HR40, the catR1 allele was amplified from HR40 genome by PCR and sequenced. A single nucleotide change from G to A at nucleotide 152 was detected, causing a codon change from Arg to Gln at residue 51. Since this residue is within a putative helix-turn-helix motif of Fur proteins (Fig. 3), we postulate that the mutated CatR protein in HR40 may be deficient in binding to the catA promoter. We analyzed the transcripts from the catA and catRgenes in wild type and HR40 mutant by S1 mapping (Fig. 4). HR40 produced catAtranscripts drastically more than the wild type, suggesting thatcatA transcription is under the negative control of CatR. HR40 also produced more catR transcripts than the wild type, especially the longer one (catRp2), whose 5′ end lies at about 70 nucleotides upstream from the translation start site. The 5′ ends of the shorter transcripts (catRp1) were located at multiple sites immediately downstream of the ATG codon. A putative promoter (TCGGGA-N18-TAGGCT) resembling the sequences recognized by the major ς factor ςHrdB was identified upstream of the translation start codon, separated from ATG by 7 residues. Therefore, it is conceivable that the shorter transcripts were generated from degradation of transcripts initiated at the translation start site (catRp1). catRp2 start sites were located more precisely by high-resolution S1 mapping at 74 and 66 nucleotides upstream from the ATG codon (data not shown). A putative ςHrdB-type promoter (TTGGCC-N17-TACAAT) was found upstream of the 74 site. The observation that catRp2 transcript was highly expressed in HR40, like the catA transcript, suggests that transcription from both catRp2 and the catApromoter is negatively regulated by CatR. The catRp1 promoter may be partially regulated by CatR. The production of CatR protein was also elevated in HR40 as judged by Western analysis (data not shown). We then examined whether catRexpression is induced by H2O2 as is thecatA expression. The changes in both catR andcatA transcripts following H2O2treatment were monitored by S1 mapping (Fig. 5). Within 10 min of H2O2 treatment, the catR transcripts increased to a maximum level and decayed to the basal level within 30 min. Both the catRp1 and catRp2 transcripts exhibited similar behavior even though catRp2 transcripts were induced more dramatically. The catA transcript increased sharply within 10 min, reaching a maximal level at around 20 min, and decayed within 60 min to the basal level. The similar kinetics of rapid induction by H2O2 of both genes suggests that the transcriptional regulation is mediated by activity modulation of an already existing regulator, most likely CatR, by H2O2. The delay observed for catAtranscript in reaching and decaying from the maximum level might reflect the higher stability of catA transcript thancatR. The changes in the level of CatA and CatR proteins followed the changes in mRNAs as judged by Western analysis (Fig. 5). The CatA protein began to increase from 20 min, reaching a maximum value between 40 and 50 min following H2O2treatment. The CatR protein also began to increase from 20 min reaching a maximum value at about 40 min. On the basis of the assumption that CatR binds directly to the promoter region of catA and catR genes we examined the nucleotide sequences of these promoter regions. The nucleotide sequences of the two promoter regions were compared with the similar sequence region of the furV-bca genes from S. venezuelae (Fig. 6). furV is divergently transcribed from the neighboring bca gene, whereas the transcription units of the catR and catA gene inS. coelicolor are distantly located. We identified an inverted repeat of 23 base pairs in all these genes; between −32 and −54 nucleotides from the start codon for catR andfurV, between −70 and −92 for catA, and between −73 and −95 for bca genes. Counting from thecatA transcription start site (+1), the inverted repeat box lies between −43 and −65. The bca gene contains putative promoter elements almost identical with the catA promoter (catAp). A consensus CatR binding sequence (TCcNRARYNR-N3-YNRYTYNgGA) was deduced. In order to verify the role of this region in vivo, we generated recombinant reporter plasmids containing thecatAp region up to −69 or −54 nucleotides from the transcription start site in front of the reporter gene in pXE4 plasmid (28Ingram C. Brawner M. Youngman P. Westpheling J. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6617-6624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). catAp-driven transcripts were determined by S1 mapping in S. lividans. The strain containing the shorter upstream sequence produced a greater amount of catAp-driven transcripts than the longer one, suggesting that the inverted repeat sequence does indeed function as a negative regulatory site (data not shown). We then examined the binding of CatR protein to the catA and catR promoter fragments by gel mobility shift assay. CatR protein overproduced in E. coliwas purified as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 1–2 mm DTT throughout the preparation. Purified CatR protein specifically bound to both catR andcatA promoters in the presence of 1 mm DTT (Fig. 7, lane 2). When t"

Reaction with oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb)1 is generally viewed to be the major fate of ⋅NO generated in the vasculature. However, recent work has shown that erythrocyte sequestration of hemoglobin, combined with flow, decreases oxyHb reaction with⋅NO and thus renders it less effective at antagonizing⋅NO bioactivity in the vessel lumen (1Liu X.

Also, the biological half-life of ⋅NO, when determined under oxyHb-free conditions (0.1–3 s), is far shorter than expected rates of ⋅NO autooxidation (3Ignarro L.J. Buga G.M. Byrns R.E. Wood K.S.

Both of these observations indicate that cell-dependent catalytic scavenging reactions will play a role in regulating ⋅NO signaling.

In hypertensive states, a role for superoxide (O⨪2) reacting with ⋅NO to form peroxynitrite (ONOO−) accounts for removal of a proportion of ⋅NO. However, this is by no means the only mechanism for ⋅NO removal because it is incompletely restored by O⨪ scavengers (7White C.R. Brock T.A. Chang L.Y. Crapo J. Briscoe P. Ku D. Bradley W.A.

In this report, a second mammalian enzyme, prostaglandin H synthase-1 (PGHS-1) is shown to also catalyze ⋅NO consumption in both purified enzyme preparations and intact platelets. In platelets, the reaction of PGHS-1 with ⋅NO led to inhibition of soluble guanylate cyclase, causing platelets to lose responsiveness to the antiaggregatory effects of ⋅NO. Because platelet-derived⋅NO serves a central role in preventing aggregation following activation of soluble guanylate cyclase, these observations indicate that, in addition to the generation of eicosanoids, catalytic consumption of ⋅NO by PGHS-1 can also contribute to its proaggregatory activity. 15(S)Hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15(S)HPETE), prostaglandin H2(PGH2), and U46619 were obtained from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Arachidonic acid was from Sigma. 15(S)HPETE and PGH2 were stored at −80 °C in the dark under N2. Arachidonic acid and U46619 were stored at −20 °C in the dark.

All fatty acids were prepared from stocks on the day of the experiment, stored on ice, and discarded after use. Unless otherwise stated, all other chemicals were from Sigma. Apo-PGHS-1 was purified from ram seminal vesicles and stored at 3.76 mg·ml−1 in 80 mmTris, pH 7.8, at −80 °C (12Marnett L.J. Siedlik P.H. Ochs R.C. Pagels W.R. Das M. Honn K.V. Warnock R.H.

The specific activity was 20 μmol arachidonate oxidized/min/mg determined polarographically using a Clark oxygen electrode. Whole blood was collected from healthy volunteers free from nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for at least 14 days. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was prepared by centrifuging whole blood collected into 3.8% trisodium citrate (blood:citrate, 9:1 v/v) at 250 × g for 10 min at room temperature (14McNicol A. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 1-25Google Scholar). Washed platelets were isolated by collecting whole blood into acid-citrate-dextrose (trisodium citrate, 2.5 g/100 ml; citric acid, 1.37 g/100 ml; glucose, 2 g/100 ml) (blood:acid-citrate-dextrose, 8.1:1.9 v/v) and centrifuging at 250 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting PRP was recentrifuged at 900 ×g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in Tyrode's buffer (134 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.9 mm KCl, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, 5 mm glucose, 0.03 g/100 ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing acid-citrate-dextrose (1:9 v/v). The platelets were washed by centrifuging at 800 × g for 10 min and then resuspended in Tyrode's buffer. Aggregation of washed platelets (2 × 108·ml−1) was monitored using a PAP4 optical aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp.). Typical aggregation responses to 0.04 unit/ml thrombin (bovine; Sigma) were 70–80%, and white blood cell contamination was less than 0.1%. For each platelet isolate, the minimum fatty acid concentration required for maximal aggregation was determined. Because albumin was routinely included to preserve functional responses, fatty acid concentrations of 40–100 μm were typically required for maximal aggregation (15Vargas J.R. Radomski M. Moncada S.

Anaerobic solutions of 1.9 mm⋅NO were prepared by equilibrating ⋅NO gas in argon-saturated deionized water. Any ⋅NO2 present was eliminated by first bubbling ⋅NO through 1 mNaOH. Nitric oxide was measured electrochemically using a ⋅NO sensor (Iso-NO, WPI Inc., Sarasota, FL). Electrode response calibration was performed by measuring ⋅NO liberated fromS-nitroso-N-acetyl-d,l-penicillamine (Alexis Corp, San Diego, CA) in the presence of 0.1 mCuSO4, pH 4.0. When ⋅NO loss was not linear, rates are given as first order rate constants (kobs) calculated by determining the slope of ln[⋅NO] versus time, according to Equation 1.d[ ⋅NO]dt=kobs[ ⋅NO]Equation 1 For all kobs values determined, the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient (r) for the slope of the replotted data was always greater than 0.9, confirming that the reaction followed first order kinetics (Table I). Where ⋅NO loss on addition of enzyme/substrates was linear, the slope of the initial rate of ⋅NO disappearance was determined.

For measurement of ⋅NO consumption by purified PGHS-1, a bolus of ⋅NO (3.8 μm) was added to 0.5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, at 37 °C with stirring and containing substrates and/or inhibitors as follows: 150 μm arachidonate (sodium salt), 400 μmphenol, 400 μm H2O2, 20 μm indomethacin, and 0.6–30 μm15(S)HPETE (sodium salt). Once electrode response had stabilized, PGHS-1 (56 nm), apoPGHS-1 (56 nm), or hematin (112 nm) was added, and the rates of ⋅NO consumption were recorded. For measurement of ⋅NO consumption by platelets, ⋅NO (3.8 μm) was added to 0.5 ml of Tyrode's buffer containing platelets and 1 mmCaCl2, in the chamber of the ⋅NO electrode, at 37 °C with stirring. l-NAME (500 μm) was added to inhibit platelet generation of ⋅NO during assays. Once the response had stabilized, arachidonate or A23187 was added, and⋅NO removal rates were monitored. In some experiments, platelets were preincubated with 20 μm indomethacin for 10 min at 37 °C before ⋅NO addition. Where used, PGH2 (30 μm) was added along with arachidonate. For measurement of⋅NO consumption by PRP, ⋅NO was added to 0.5 ml PRP at 37 °C with stirring. In some experiments, thrombin (0.04 unit/ml) was added 10 s before ⋅NO. Repeated additions of ⋅NO (3.8 μm each) and PGHS-1 (50 nm each), were made to 0.5 ml of 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4 containing 22 μm15(S)HPETE. Following each addition of ⋅NO and PGHS-1, rates of ⋅NO depletion were monitored electrochemically, until levels approached 0 μm, at which point the next⋅NO additions was made. When ⋅NO uptake rates slowed, because of PGHS-1 self-inactivation, additional enzyme was added. Finally, when PGHS-1 addition no longer caused ⋅NO consumption (i.e. upon depletion of the 22 μm15(S)HPETE), aliquots were removed for hydroperoxide analysis. At this point, 250 nm PGHS-1 and 49.4 μm⋅NO had been added. For hydroperoxide analysis, 100 μl of sample was added to 50 μl of assay reagent (5 mg of leukomethylene blue, 8 ml of dimethylformamide, 1.4 g of Triton X-100, 5.5 mg of hemoglobin in 100 ml of 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 5.0), and 620 nm absorbance was measured (18Auerbach B.J. Kiely J.S. Cornicelli J.A Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). For spectral analysis, PGHS-1 (56 nm) with or without 19 μm⋅NO was added to 1 ml of 100 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 7.2 μm HPETE and incubated for 6 min at room temperature. Conjugated dienes were determined spectroscopically. Nitric oxide (500 nm) was added to 500 μl of platelets (5.3 × 108·ml−1) in Tyrode's buffer, containing 1 mml-NAME, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm 3-isobutuyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), with stirring at 37 °C. Upon maximal electrode response, arachidonate, U46619, or oxyHb (prepared from metHb by dithionite reduction followed by Sephadex G25 chromatography) was added. For measurements of cGMP synthesis by PRP, ⋅NO (1.9 μm), was added simultaneously with 1 mm IBMX to 0.5 ml PRP at 37 °C with stirring. Where utilized, thrombin (0.04 unit/ml) was added 10 s before ⋅NO and IBMX. Samples were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before removal of aliquots for analysis of cGMP using a commercial radioimmunoassay kit (Biotrak; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Nitric oxide decay in aerobic phosphate buffer followed first order kinetics with a rate constant (kobs) of 8.6 ± 1.6 × 10−3 s−1. Although aerobic oxidation of ⋅NO is second order overall (17Ignarro L.J. Fukito J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Burns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar), at the low ⋅NO concentrations used in this study alternative first order reactions predominate that include gas phase diffusion and⋅NO consumption by the electrode. Using thiskobs, rates of background ⋅NO loss at any concentration could be determined (i.e. at 3.8 μm, ⋅NO loss was 1.96 ± 0.3 μm·min−1). Rates of ⋅NO consumption by washed platelets (8 × 108 ml−1) were not significantly increased over background and followed first order kinetics (kobs = 8.0 ± 0.2 × 10−3 s−1), indicating that cell-dependent ⋅NO uptake does not occur in resting platelets. Upon arachidonate addition, increased ⋅NO consumption immediately occurred (0.40 ± 0.04 nmol·min−1·108 platelets−1, after background correction; n = 3, means ± SD) (Fig. 1 a). Fatty acid concentrations of 40–100 μm were required for maximal aggregation because of the albumin added to maintain platelet functional responses, thus reducing the potency of exogenously added fatty acids as platelet agonists (15Vargas J.R. Radomski M. Moncada S. Prostaglandins. 1982; 23: 929-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). For each platelet preparation, the minimum fatty acid concentration required for maximal aggregation was first determined and utilized thereafter. Addition of CuZn superoxide dismutase (6000 units/ml) was without effect (not shown), however, ⋅NO consumption was completely inhibited by the PGHS-1 inhibitor, indomethacin (20 μm; Fig. 1 a). Rates of ⋅NO uptake decreased over 1–1.5 min, paralleling decreasing rates of arachidonate-dependent oxygen consumption (not shown), an index of platelet PGHS-1 activity (19Schafer A.I. Turner N.A. Handin R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 20Akkerman J.W.N. Holmsen H. Loughnane M. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 97: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Addition of the PGHS-1 product, PGH2 (30 μm), and arachidonate in concert to indomethacin-treated platelets did not stimulate ⋅NO uptake, revealing that PGHS-1 activity, rather than secondary reactions of PGHS-1 products (e.g. through PGH2 metabolism by thromboxane synthase), was responsible for ⋅NO consumption (Fig. 1 a). Nitric oxide consumption (0.1 ± 0.02 nmol·min·108platelets−1, after background correction; means ± SD, n = 3) was also observed following stimulation of platelets by the calcium ionophore, A23187 (300 nm) (Fig. 1 b). Unlike arachidonate, a lag period of 15–20 s was observed before a transient (20–30 s) rate of ⋅NO consumption was initiated. A23187-dependent ⋅NO consumption was partially inhibited by indomethacin, indicating that PGHS-1 dependent⋅NO uptake was partially involved (Fig. 1 b). To elucidate the impact of ⋅NO consumption by PGHS-1 during platelet aggregation, platelet cGMP was determined following addition of exogenous ⋅NO (500 nm) and activation of platelets by arachidonate. Significant suppression of ⋅NO-stimulated soluble guanylate cyclase activity occurred following arachidonate activation of platelets and upon addition of oxyHb to scavenge ⋅NO (Fig. 2). The thromboxane A2agonist U46619, which activates platelet aggregation downstream of PGHS-1 without causing ⋅NO uptake (not shown), did not suppress stimulation of platelet cGMP generation (Fig. 2). These data indicate that PGHS-1-mediated ⋅NO consumption inhibits ⋅NO activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. To determine whether catalytic⋅NO consumption influences platelet function, the sensitivity of platelets to ⋅NO-mediated inhibition of aggregation was evaluated following activation with arachidonate and the thromboxane A2 mimetic, U46619, that does not suppress⋅NO-dependent cGMP generation (Fig. 2). Both agonists trigger platelet aggregation via thromboxane receptor activation, the phosphorylation of which is partially responsible for inhibition of aggregation by ⋅NO (21Wang G.W. Zhu Y. Halushka P.V. Lincoln T.M. Mendelsohn M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4888-4893Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). GSNO was utilized to provide a continuous source of ⋅NO, and l-NAME was added to prevent platelet ⋅NO generation. The requirement for⋅NO in the platelet inhibitory effects of GSNO was indicated by full restoration of aggregation upon inclusion of 3 μmoxyHb (not shown). Concentrations of GSNO (0.5–2.0 μm) that had no effect on arachidonate-induced platelet aggregation fully inhibited aggregation induced by U46619 (Fig. 3). For partial inhibition ofU46619-induced aggregation, only 1–20 nm GSNO was required, whereas up to 50 μm GSNO did not significantly impact arachidonate-induced aggregation (not shown). These data implicate PGHS-1-dependent ⋅NO consumption in the regulation of platelet responses to ⋅NO. For experiments utilizing thrombin, PRP was utilized since it is a more physiological platelet preparation (e.g.containing plasma-derived constituents such as albumin and lipoproteins). Nitric oxide or cGMP analogs inhibit thrombin receptor signaling, including activation of platelet arachidonate release (22Pigazzi A. Heydrick S. Folli F. Benoit S. Michelson A. Loscalzo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14368-14375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 23Sane D.C. Bielawaka A. Greenberg C.S. Hannun Y.A. Biochem.

To ensure that ⋅NO did not block arachidonate release, the order of agonist addition was reversed, with thrombin added to PRP 10 s prior to ⋅NO, and the peak of detectable ⋅NO then determined (Fig. 4 B). When ⋅NO was added to PRP in the absence of agonists, the initial concentration of detectable ⋅NO was consistently lower than when ⋅NO was added to phosphate-buffered saline (a decrease of 1.1 ± 0.6 μm, n = 3 different PRP preparations, not shown). This may result from reaction of⋅NO with contaminating oxyHb or the possible formation ofS-nitrosothiols upon addition of ⋅NO to plasma (25Scharfstein J.S. Keaney J.F. Slivka A. Welch G.N. Vita J.A. Stamler J.A. Loscalzo J. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, following ⋅NO addition to 0.04 unit/ml thrombin-activated PRP, a further and significant decrease in peak⋅NO concentration was observed (representing a decrease of 0.8 ± 0.17 μm, n = 3 different donors; Fig. 4, a and b). This response was fully inhibited by indomethacin, indicating a requirement for PGHS-1 activity, and suppressed generation of cGMP by platelet soluble guanylate cyclase (Fig. 4, a and c). These data indicate that thrombin-stimulated PGHS-1 attenuates the antiaggregatory effects of ⋅NO in platelets. Following platelet activation by collagen (4 μg/ml), indomethacin-insensitive but superoxide dismutase-inhibitable⋅NO consumption was observed (not shown). This was expected because collagen stimulates platelet superoxide (O⨪2) generation through an uncharacterized pathway, and O⨪2 reacts with ⋅NO at almost diffusion limited rates (26Caccese D. Pratico D. Ghiselli A. Natoli S. Pignatelli P. Sanguigni V. Iuliano L. Violi F. Thromb. Haemost. 2000; 83: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Pignatelli P. Pulcinelli F.M. Lenti L.

Toxicol. 1997; 10: 1285-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Finally,⋅NO consumption was not stimulated in PRP by ADP (5 μm) (not shown), possibly because of ADP being relatively less potent than thrombin (29Malle E. Nimpf J. Leis H.J. Gleispach H. Kostner G.M. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Med. 1987; 27: 53-70Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 30Balduini C.L. Bertolino G. Noris P. Sinigaglia F. Bisio A. Torti M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1988; 156: 823-829Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism(s) by which platelet PGHS-1 could consume ⋅NO, purified PGHS-1 was utilized. In the absence of substrate, heme-reconstituted holoenzyme did not consume ⋅NO (Fig. 5 a). However, either H2O2 or 15(S)HPETE stimulated PGHS-1 ⋅NO consumption dose-dependently (126 μm·min−1·μm−1and 264 μm·min−1·μm−1PGHS-1 using 400 μm H2O2 or 12 μm HPETE, respectively (Fig. 5, Table 1; and data not shown). 15(S)HPETE was the more potent co-substrate, because it is more efficiently reduced by the peroxidase activity of PGHS-1, having a Km(app) of 3.27 ± 0.35 μm (Fig. 6 a). Hydroperoxide-stimulated ⋅NO consumption by PGHS-1 required heme reconstitution (Fig. 5 b) and was not inhibited by indomethacin. These data indicate that ⋅NO is consumed by acting as a reducing co-substrate for PGHS-1 peroxidase activity. The reducing substrate phenol did not stimulate PGHS-1-dependent⋅NO consumption (not shown), excluding a reaction of ⋅NO with the ferric heme. However, phenol stimulated rates of both H2O2 and 15(S)HPETE-dependent ⋅NO consumption by PGHS-1, most likely through reaction of ⋅NO with phenoxyl radicals generated via one-electron oxidation of phenol by PGHS-1 compounds 1 and 2 (Fig. 5 b and data not shown).Figure 6Analysis of HPETE following ⋅NO consumption by PGHS-1. a,Km (app) was determined by measuring initial rates of ⋅NO consumption by 56 nm PGHS-1 at varying 15(S)HPETE concentrations. Michaelis-Menten parameters were calculated using Enzfitter (Elsevier Biosoft). Rates of⋅NO consumption are plotted as v versus v/[s]. b, hyydroperoxides were determined by leukomethylene blue oxidation in samples generated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (n = 3, means ± S.D.). *, p < 0.05 following analysis of variance and Bonferroni/Dunn post hoc test analysis. c, absorbance spectra were obtained on samples prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Peak a, difference spectrum of 7.2 μm HPETE minus buffer. Peak b, difference spectrum of 7.2 μm HPETE and 56 nm PGHS-1 minus 56 nm PGHS-1 alone.Peak c, difference spectrum of 7.2 μm HPETE, 56 nm PGHS-1, and 19 μm⋅NOminus 56 nm PGHS-1 and 19 μm⋅NO. d, PGHS-1 (56 nm) was added to 0.5 ml of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing HPETE (0–1 μm) and ⋅NO (3.8 μm) at 37 °C, with stirring. Amount of ⋅NO consumed was measured electrochemically by drawing tangents, and plotted against HPETE concentration (n = 3, means ± S.D.).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further probe the mechanism of PGHS-1-dependent⋅NO consumption, the fate of added 15(S)HPETE was examined. Following incubation with PGHS-1 and ⋅NO, 92% of the hydroperoxide substituent of 15(S)HPETE became undetectable, with retention of the characteristic conjugated diene spectrum (Fig. 6,b and c). The stoichiometry of ⋅NO consumed per mol 15(S)HPETE added was 2.14 ± 0.2 (r = 0.98) (Fig. 6 d), consistent with⋅NO acting as a reducing substrate for PGHS-1 reduction of LOOH to LOH (Scheme FS1). This study shows that PGHS-1 consumes ⋅NO via peroxidase-dependent mechanisms and that ⋅NO consumption by platelet PGHS-1 attenuates the antiaggregatory actions of ⋅NO. This controlled catalytic mechanism for ⋅NO consumption and the consequent inhibition of ⋅NO signaling also reveals a concerted proaggregatory function of PGHS-1, the generation of eicosanoid products, and the catalytic consumption of⋅NO. Prostaglandin H synthase is a heme enzyme that catalyzes the initial steps of arachidonate oxidation required for eicosanoid synthesis. PGHS exhibits two distinct activities, a cyclooxygenase activity utilizing a tyrosyl radical intermediate to convert arachidonate to PGG2 and a heme-dependent peroxidase which reduces PGG2 to PGH2. Although both activities are situated on separate sites on the PGHS protein, cross-over reactions do take place (31Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv. Immunol. 1996; 62: 167-214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Marnett L.J. Maddipati K.R. Everse J Everse K. Grisham M. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology.

Nature. 1994; 367: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). For example, oxidation of the heme by peroxides (e.g. PGG2) is required to form PGHS compound 1, which in turn activates the cyclooxygenase activity by oxidizing the catalytic tyrosine, forming the tyrosyl radical (35Tsai A.L. Kulmacz R.J. Parker G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10503-10508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Nitric oxide interacts with purified PGHS in multiple ways. First, reaction of ⋅NO with the resting ferric heme to yield a nitrosyl complex occurs with equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.92 mm (36Tsai A.L. Wei C. Kulmacz R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 313: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Because ⋅NO concentrations do not approach mm levels in vivo, this complex is not expected biologically. Second,⋅NO can terminate the catalytic tyrosyl radical, forming 3-nitrosotyrosine, which rearranges to form 3-nitrotyrosine (37Goodwin D.C. Gunther M.R. Hsi L.C. Crews B.C. Eling T.E. Mason R.P.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17086-17090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Although this reaction has allowed identification of the catalytic tyrosine residue as Tyr385, it does not appear to play a role under biological conditions, because it is effectively suppressed by arachidonate (39Goodwin D.C. Landino L.M. Marnett L.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1121-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Finally, ⋅NO can act as a reducing peroxidase substrate for PGHS-1, promoting reduction of 5-phenyl-4-pentenyl-hydroperoxide (40Curtis J.F. Reddy N.G. Mason R.P. Kalyanaraman B. Eling T.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although rate constants are not known for this reaction, ⋅NO reacts with compounds 1 and 2 of horseradish peroxidase, at rates of 105–106m−1·s−1 (41Glover R.E. Koshkin V. Dunford H.B. Mason R.P. Nitric Oxide. 1999; 3: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 42Ischiropoulos H. Nelson J. Duran D. Al-Mehdi A. Free. Rad. Biol. Med. 1996; 20: 373-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The present data are consistent with this mechanism mediating ⋅NO consumption, because purified PGHS-1 catalytically consumed ⋅NO in the presence of hydroperoxide, although in intact platelets, additional mechanisms may be operative. Unlike purified PGHS-1,⋅NO uptake by platelets was sensitive to the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. In these cells, peroxidase activity will require prior generation of the hydroperoxide, PGG2, generated by PGHS-1 through indomethacin-sensitive cyclooxygenase turnover. To identify pathways of cellular ⋅NO consumption, platelets were utilized because they both generate and respond to ⋅NO. Nitric oxide blocks thrombin signaling in platelets via cGMP-dependent inhibition of phosphoinositide3-kinase and PLA2 and phosphorylation of the thromboxane receptor (21Wang G.W. Zhu Y.

Therefore, to explore the influence of thrombin on PGHS-1-dependent ⋅NO uptake, thrombin was added to platelets immediately before ⋅NO. In vivo, thrombin activation of platelets and thromboxane synthesis occurs and is elevated in vascular diseases including sickle cell anemia and atherosclerosis. Because ⋅NO is a central inhibitor of platelet-endothelial interactions in vivo, both the accelerated generation of thromboxane and exposure of platelets to⋅NO will occur together in the vasculature. Generation of ⋅NO by platelets in response to pro-aggregatory agonists acts as a negative feedback mechanism because aggregation is inhibited by ⋅NO (43Malinski T. Radomski M.W. Taha Z. Moncada S.

Herein, platelet ⋅NO consumption of 0.1–0.4 nmol·min−1·108 platelets−1 or 0.8 ± 0.17 μm by thrombin-activated PRP indicates that platelet ⋅NO removal will significantly impair⋅NO-dependent signaling during aggregation. In support of this precept, activation of platelets by thrombin or arachidonate was found to significantly (i) suppress⋅NO-dependent platelet cGMP generation and (ii) decrease the sensitivity of platelets to the antiaggregatory effects of⋅NO. In summary, PGHS-1 consumes ⋅NO via utilization as a reducing peroxidase substrate. Also, PGHS-1-dependent consumption of⋅NO during platelet aggregation inhibits cGMP generation and decreases platelet sensitivity to the antiaggregatory effects of⋅NO. The activation of PGHS-1 and subsequent generation of proaggregatory thromboxane A2 plays a central role in platelet aggregation. Therefore, PGHS-1 consumption of ⋅NO is important because it (i) represents a novel proaggregatory function for PGHS-1 by serving as a regulatable biological sink for ⋅NO and (ii) demonstrates a controlled catalytic pathway for ⋅NO consumption by vascular cells.

Using intense synchrotron radiation for the excitation, the oxygen and nickel atoms in a nickel oxide sample are imaged in three dimensions with high resolution inside a volume of about 1,000 cubic ångströms. These remarkable characteristics mean that X-ray holography bridges the gap between diffraction, which relies on long-range order, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure, which gives information on the local environment of atoms."

To explore the molecular basis for this phenotype, DNA sequences of Gb3 synthase (α1,4-galactosyltransferase; α1,4Gal-T) in six p phenotype individuals from Japan and Sweden were analyzed. A missense mutation P251L and a nonsense mutation W261stop in three and one Japanese indivuiduals, respectively, and missense mutations M183K and G187D in one each of two Swedish p individuals were found, indicating that p individuals from Japan and Sweden have distinct and multiple homozygous point mutations in the coding region. In the function analysis of the mutated α1,4Gal-Ts by the transfection of the expression vectors, P251L and M183K mutations showed complete loss of enzyme function, and W261stop and G187D mutations resulted in the marginal activity. BLAST analysis of homologous sequences of α1,4Gal-T revealed that three residues, Met183, Gly187, and Pro251, at which missense mutations were found, were highly conserved among all species examined, suggesting their importance for the function of α1,4Gal-T. p phenotype individuals lack both Pk (Gb3) and P (Gb4) glycolipid antigens of the P blood group system.

A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Gb3 is converted to P (globoside; Gb4), a major species of neutral glycolipids in human erythrocytes. Therefore, erythrocytes deficient in the synthesis of Gb3 lack both Gb3 and Gb4 (3Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Naiki M. Makita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas erythrocytes lacking Gb4 synthase show absence of Gb4 (4Marcus D. Naiki M. Kundu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

P1 antigen, in contrast, belongs to the neolacto-series glycolipids and has been identified as α1,4Gal-neolactotetraosylceramide (5Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Individuals of the p phenotype lack P1 antigen, in addition to Gb3 and P (Gb4), presumably as a result of deficiency in the enzyme α1,4-galactosyltransferase (α1,4Gal-T) responsible for the synthesis of Gb3 from lactosylceramide (3Kijimoto-Ochiai S. Naiki M. Makita A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5407-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 4Marcus D. Naiki M. Kundu S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gb3 was detected not only in erythrocytes but in various epithelial cells and hematopoietic cells including immature B cells in the germinal center. Although Gb3 was defined as Burkitt lymphoma-associated antigen (6Wiels J. Fellous M. Tursz T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6485-6488Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), it is now called Gb3/CD77 and is considered to be a differentiation antigen of B cell lineage (7Klein G. Manneborg-Sandlund A.

Gb3/CD77 is also known as a receptor molecule for Shiga-like toxins from Escherichia coli O157, causing hemolytic uremic syndrome (9Karmali M.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 15-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar). The presence/absence of Gb3/CD77 may, therefore, have critical implications in long-term survival of mankind. Recently, we have isolated cDNAs for α1,4Gal-T (9Karmali M.A. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 2: 15-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar) and showed that the introduction of this cDNA could reconstitute the functional receptor for verotoxins leading to apoptosis (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol.

In the present study, we have analyzed the molecular basis of Pk/p antigen phenotypes by the investigation of abnormalities in theα1,4Gal-T gene in p phenotype individuals from Japan and Sweden. Although Steffensen et al. (11Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Nilsson S.B. Bennett E.P. Jersild C. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16723-16729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) reported that Swedish p individuals have a missense mutation at M183K, we show that Japanese p individuals have different and multiple missense or nonsense point mutations in the coding region. We also defined another missense mutation in a Swedish p individual. These mutations seem to have been generated after the divergence of the two ethnic groups. The importance of the defined mutation sites in the enzyme function is discussed based on the aligned genes from the BLAST data base. Theα1,4Gal-T gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using PfuTurboTM DNA polymerase (Stratagene) from genomic DNAs extracted from peripheral mononuclear cells. The four sets of primers used are as follows: 1) 5′primer, 5′-TGGCGGGTGCTCATCTCTTG-3′ (in the first intron) and 3′primer, 5′-TTGGTCCGG TCTGAAGTCTC-3′; 2) 5′primer, 5′-CCACTCCAGGCAACATCTTC-3′ and 3′primer, 5′-AGGTAGATGCCGCCGAACTT-3′; 3) 5′primer, 5′-GACGCCTCCAGGATCGCACT-3′ and 3′primer, 5′-CTCCTCCGGGTTGATGTCCT-3′; and 4) 5′primer, 5′-GCAGGACTGGAAGAA GTAC-3′ and 3′primer, 5′-GCCCC ATCAGGAGCAGGTTG-3′. Conditions of PCR consisted of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and then extension at 74 °C for 1 min. The amplified products were directly sequenced by dideoxy termination method using an ABI PRISM® 310 genetic analyzer (PE Biosystems). The α1,4Gal-T expression vectors for individual mutants were constructed by PCR of the coding region using a 5′primer containing an EcoRI site, 5′-ACCATGTCCAAGCCCCCCGACCTC-3′, and a 3′primer containing anXhoI site, 5′-CCCCTCACAAGTACATTTTCATG-3′, and by subcloning into EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged expression vectors were also constructed with PCR products of the coding region to form a fusion enzyme with the myc epitope at the N′ terminus by subcloning intoBamHI and XhoI sites of myc-tagged pcDNA3 vector. The primers for the construction of the myc fusion protein were as follows: 5′primer containing a BamHI site, 5′-TCCAAGCCCCCCGACCTC and 3′primer containing an XhoI site, 5′-CCCCTCACAAGTA CATTTTCATG-3′. These constructs were served to sequence analysis to confirm the correct junctions and the absence of artificial mutations. A mouse fibroblast L cell line was kindly provided by Dr. A. P. Albino (Sloan-Kettring Cancer Center, New York, NY) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 7.5% fetal bovine serum. Constructs for the gene expression were introduced into cells by DEAE-dextran method as described previously (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). After culture for 48 h, cells were harvested to be used for further analyses. Expression of Gb3/CD77 antigen was analyzed by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson) as described (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). α1,4Gal-T activity was measured as described previously (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K.

Briefly, membrane fractions were prepared with a nitrogen cavitation apparatus and centrifugation of the extracts at 105,000 × g for 1 h. The enzyme products were separated by Sep-Pak C18 (Waters) and then applied to a thin layer chromatograph. Autofluorography was performed using a BioImaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The transfectant cells with myc-tagged expression vectors were served for Western immunoblotting after lysis with lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH7.4), 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates containing 50 μg each of protein were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were incubated with anti-myc monoclonal antibody, and antibody binding was detected with an Vectastain ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Myc-tagged expression vectors were transfected into L cells and then stained by anti-myc monoclonal antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate-anti-mouse IgG after fixation. The staining pattern was observed by confocal microscopy (MicroRadiance; Bio-Rad). α1,4Gal-T is the enzyme that synthesizes Gb3/CD77 (Pk antigen) from lactosylceramide (Fig.1 A). BLAST analysis of the genomic structure of α1,4Gal-T revealed that theα1,4Gal-T gene consisted of at least 2 exons, and the entire coding region existed in exon 2 (Fig. 1 B). Using primers designed as indicated in Fig. 1 B, the entire coding region of α1,4Gal-T was amplified with the genomic DNA as a template and was directly sequenced. Sequence analyses of six p samples consisting of four Japanese (J1, J2, J3, and J4) and two Swedish (S1 and S2) individuals were performed. Four kinds of missense mutation nucleotides (nt.), nt.109AΔG (M37V), nt.548TΔA (M183K), nt.560GΔA (G187D), and nt.752CΔT (P251L), and one nonsense mutation nt.783GΔA (W261stop) were detected. Three of four Japanese individuals contained the P251L mutation, and one of them contained W261stop. Both of them were different from the mutations M183K and G187D found in two Swedish donors (Fig. 1 C). Two silent mutations, nt.903GΔC (P301P) and nt.987GΔA (T329T), were also found (Fig. 1 D). In contrast, mutations could not be detected in two P individuals (data not shown). To confirm whether the mutations G187D (S1 type), P251L (J1 type), W261stop (J4 type), and M183K (S2 type) were responsible for the defects of α1,4Gal-T activity, we examined the function of the expressed mutant cDNAs, as well as the wild type. The expression vectors simply containing the full-length of the coding region or myc-tagged expression vectors for each mutant, as well as wild type, were constructed and transfected into L cells. The M37V mutation is known not to affect the enzyme activity (11Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Nilsson S.B. Bennett E.P. Jersild C. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16723-16729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In the flow cytometric analysis of L cell transfectants, the WT gene caused definite Gb3 expression. In contrast, transfectant cells with α1,4Gal-T/J1 (J1 type) and α1,4Gal-T/S2 did not express Gb3 at all, and those with α1,4Gal-T/J4 and α1,4Gal-T/S1 expressed minimal levels of Gb3 (Fig.2 A). Myc-tagged expression vectors and non-tagged vectors showed identical results (data not shown). The expression levels of the transfected gene products were almost equivalent between mutants and the wild type as detected by an anti-myc antibody (Fig. 2 B). The 42-kDa bands seemed to be myc-tagged α1,4Gal-Ts, and a 32-kDa band seemed to be a truncated form of α1,4Gal-T (J4) because of the stop codon at the residue Trp261. The α1,4Gal-T activities in the membrane fractions of the transfectant cells were examined using lactosylceramide or galactosylceramide as acceptors (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). All mutants exhibited loss of enzyme activity (Fig. 3 A). Because weak Gb3 expression was detected in W261stop (J4 type) and G187D (S1 type) by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis we tried long exposure, resulting in the appearance of faint Gb3 bands in these mutants (Fig. 3 B). The enzyme activities toward lactosylceramide were 8.46, 0.007, and 0.03 nmol/mg of protein/h for wild type, J4, and S1, respectively (Fig. 3 C). The enzyme activities toward galactosylceramide as an acceptor were quite similar to those for lactosylceramide (Fig. 3, D and E),i.e. two of them showed no activity, and the other two showed minimal levels of activity only by long-exposed autofluorography (data not shown). Based on BLAST analysis of data bases using the coding region of α1,4Gal-T, homologous sequences from human, other primates, rat, Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana were identified and aligned. These genes seemed to belong to theα1,4Gal-T/α1,4GlcNAc-T family. The residues Gly187 and Pro251, which were mutated in S1 and J1, J2, and J3 p individuals, respectively, were completely conserved among all species examined, indicating the importance of these residues for enzyme function. The residue Met183 was also highly conserved. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the lack of enzyme activity in the mutant clones, intracellular localization of the expressed enzymes was compared. All mutants showed a similar staining pattern to the wild type (data not shown). In this study, we have found 3 novel mutations and one previously reported mutation (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) in the α1,4Gal-T gene. Among 4 mutations found in the coding region, W261stop and G187D showed minimal levels of enzyme activity, i.e. only 0.08–0.36% of the wild type. Consequently, they seemed not to be able to synthesize Gb3in vivo, resulting in p phenotype. Our results indicated that mutations in α1,4Gal-T had occurred at multiple and distinct sites, at least in Japanese and Swedish individuals. The results described here indicated that gene mutations inducing p phenotype had been generated after the divergence of mankind into different ethnic groups, as had mutations of the α1,2-fucosyltransferase II (Se/se) gene (12Kudo T.

The cluster of the gene mutation found in Vasterbotten County in Sweden may be one of the representative mutations found in Caucasian individuals (11Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B.

This situation is quite contrastive to the ABO blood group, in which the polymorphism based on commonly shared gene mutations in the allelic locus (14Yamamoto F. Clausen H. White T. Marken J. Hakomori S. Nature. 1990; 345: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar) is found all over the world. The most controversial point in the P/p blood group antigen system has been whether P1 (15Naiki M. Fong J. Ledeen R. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4831-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and Pk are synthesized by a single enzyme or by distinct two enzymes (5Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The ratio of P1+/P1− is 8:2 in Caucasian individuals (1Landsteiner K. Levine P. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1927; 24: 941-943Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar,16Daniels G.L. Anstee D.J. Cartron J.P. Dahr W. Garratty G. Henry S. Jorgensen J. Judd W.J. Kornstad L. Levene C. Lomas-Francis C.

Vox Sang. 1999; 77: 52-57Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and 3:7 in Japanese individuals (17Tomisawa S. Kogure T. Kuroume T. Leffler H. Lomberg H. Shimabukoro N. Terao K. Svanborg Eden C. Scand. J. Infect. Dis. 1989; 21: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and incidence of p is very rare in all races, indicating that P1 synthase and Pksynthase are not identical. Furthermore, no significant mutation in the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene corresponding to P1+/P1− phenotypes could be found in the studies of our own (data not shown) and other groups (11Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Nilsson S.B. Bennett E.P. Jersild C. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16723-16729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), confirming that the Gb3/CD77 synthase gene is not responsible for the synthesis of P1. Actually, no incorporation of [14C]Gal onto paragloboside could be detected in the substrate specificity analysis of the cloned cDNA (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The remaining mystery is that the p phenotype is always associated with a lack of P1 expression. One explanation is that Gb3/CD77 synthase acts exclusively toward lactosylceramide, and P1 synthase mainly utilizes neolacto-series acceptors but also, to some degree, lactosylceramide. In this case, p phenotype can be generated only when inactivation of both of these two enzyme genes occurs, although other reasons are possible (5Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4837-4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast to the β1,3-galactosyltransferase or β1,4-galactosyltransferase families (18Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), theα1,4Gal-T/α1,4GlcNAc-T gene family has only two members in mammals. No other homologous cDNA was detectable in any data base a year ago (10Kojima Y. Fukumoto S. Furukawa K. Okajima T. Wiels J. Yokoyama K. Suzuki Y. Urano T. Ohta M. Furukawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15152-15156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the same Gb3/CD77 synthase cDNA was subsequently cloned using α1,4GlcNAc-T cDNA (19Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) as a probe for PC cloning (11Steffensen R. Carlier K. Wiels J. Levery S.B. Stroud M. Cedergren B. Nilsson S.B. Bennett E.P. Jersild C. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16723-16729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, from sequences that have been deposited within the last year, many homologous cDNAs to α1,4Gal-T can now be found in the data base of many other species from primates to insects or plants (Fig.4). These genes share several highly homologous regions conserved through all species examined, and it is significant that all missense mutations found in human p phenotype occurred in these conserved regions (Fig. 4). These results indicate that this gene family has been conserved because of its importance in the survival or protection of the host against exogenous invasions, although the real substrates for these gene products in individual species remain to be identified. Recent studies on the substrate preferentiality of an α1,4Gal-T in insect cells suggest that the activity may be toward Galβ1,3GalNAcα1-R and not for Galβ1,4Glc- structures (20Lopez M. Gazon M. Juliant S. Plancke Y. Leroy Y. Strecker G. Cartron J.P. Bailly P. Cerutti M. Verbert A. Delannoy P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33644-33651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Consequently, enzyme products of these sequence-conserved genes may not necessarily be identical, and utilized nucleotide sugars may also be diverse, as shown in the analysis of the β1,3Gal-T family (18Amado M.

We have now used a monoclonal antibody (mAb) approach to further analyze the structure and function of CNA. 22 mAbs raised against the minimal ligand binding domain, CNA-(151–318), were shown to bind to the MSCRAMM with similar affinity. All mAbs appear to recognize conformation-dependent epitopes that were mapped throughout the CNA-(151–318) domain using a chimeric strategy where segments of CNA are grafted on ACE, a structurally related MSCRAMM fromEnterococcus faecalis. These mAbs were able to inhibit125I-collagen binding to CNA-(151–318) as well as to intact S. aureus cells. They also interfered with the attachment of bacteria to collagen substrates. Furthermore, some of the mAbs could effectively displace 125I-collagen bound to the bacteria. These displacing mAbs were also able to detach bacteria that had adhered to a collagen substrate in a preincubation, raising the possibility that some of the mAbs may be used as therapeutic agents.

Microbial Surface Component Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules a collagen-binding protein from S. aureus a collagen-binding protein from E. faecalis enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay glutathioneS-transferase monoclonal antibody polymerase chain reaction extracellular matrix phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Staphylococcus aureus is a multipotential bacterial pathogen that can colonize a wide range of host tissues and cause a variety of infections such as wound infections, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and septic arthritis. As with most infectious agents, initial attachment of S. aureus to the host tissues is considered the first crucial step in the disease process. Staphylococci produce a family of adhesins of the MSCRAMM (Microbial Surface Component Recognizing Adhesive Matrix Molecules)1 type that mediate adherence to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Collagen is the main component of the ECM of most tissues, and S. aureus can express a collagen-binding MSCRAMM, called CNA. Switalski et al. (1Switalski L. Patti J.M. Butcher W. Gristina A.G. Speziale P. Höök M. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) demonstrated that CNA was necessary and sufficient for S. aureus to attach to cartilage in vitro, suggesting that CNA can act as an adhesin. Furthermore, CNA was shown to be a virulence factor in experimental septic arthritis (2Patti J.M. Bremell T. Krajewska-Pietrasik D. Abdelnour A. Tarkowski A. Rydén C. Höök M. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 152-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CNA+ strains showed substantially increased virulence compared with the isogenic CNA− strains as demonstrated by macroscopic clinical evaluation and histopathological analysis of the joints. No viable S. aureus cells were recovered from the joints of mice injected with the CNA− strains, although significant numbers of S. aureus cells were isolated from the joints of those injected with the CNA+ strains. In addition, vaccination with a recombinant fragment of CNA protected mice from septic death induced by intravenously administered S. aureus (3Nilsson I.-M. Patti J.M. Bremell T. Höök M.

A collagen adhesin YadA was identified in Y. enterocolitica and shown to contribute to the arthritogenicity of the bacteria in a rat model (17Gripenberg-Lerche C. Skurnik M. Zhang L. Soderstrom K.-O. Toivanen P. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 5568-5575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of two histidine residues in YadA with alanine abrogated bacterial binding and adherence to collagen, and reduced the virulence of the bacteria in a mouse model (18Roggenkamp A. Neuberger H.-R. Flugel A. Schmoll T. Heesemann J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1207-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that collagen binding is an important step in theY. enterocolitica disease process. CNA has structural features characteristic of cell wall-anchored proteins on Gram-positive bacteria. CNA consists of an N-terminal signal peptide, a non-repetitive A region, one to four repeated units (B-region), followed by a cell wall anchor region, a transmembrane segment, and a short positively charged cytoplasmic tail. The A region of CNA-(30–531) was found to be fully responsible for the collagen binding activity of CNA (19Patti J.M. Boles J.O. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11428-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 20Rich R.L. Demeler B. Ashby K. Deivanayagam C.C.S. Petrich J.W. Patti J.M. Narayana S.V.L. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15423-15433Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The minimum binding domain was localized to a 19-kDa fragment, CNA-(151–318) (formerly designated M19- and CBD-(151–318)), within CNA-(30–529) (19Patti J.M. Boles J.O. Höök M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11428-11435Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recombinant CNA-(151–318) was crystallized and its structure solved (21Symersky J. Patti J.M. Carson M. House-Pompeo K. Teale M. Moore D. Jin L. Schneider A. DeLucas L.J. Höök M. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). CNA-(151–318) forms a β-barrel composed of two antiparallel β-sheets and two short α-helices. β-Strands A, B, part of D, E, and H form β-sheet I, and strands C, part of D, F, G, I, and J form β-sheet II. β-Sheet I contains a surface trench into which a triple helical collagen molecule fits as shown by docking experiments using theoretical collagen probes of [(Gly-Pro-Pro)4]3 or [(Gly-Pro-Hyp)4]3. Site-directed mutagenesis of some residues in the putative binding trench of CNA-(151–318) abolished collagen binding (Y175K, R189A, F191A, N193K, and Y233A) or caused reduced binding affinity (N223K and N278K) (21Symersky J. Patti J.M. Carson M. House-Pompeo K. Teale M. Moore D. Jin L. Schneider A. DeLucas L.J. Höök M. Narayana S.V.L. Nat. Struct.

Two truncates of CNA-(151–318) that had the N-terminal 30 amino acids or the C-terminal 22 amino acids removed, respectively, were generated and were found to be unable to bind collagen CNA-(157–297) or be insoluble CNA-(181–318). CNA-(157–297) contains all residues of the trench, and CNA-(181–318) contains all but six of the residues in the binding trench, suggesting that the intact CNA-(181–318) molecule is important in presenting the trench in an active collagen binding conformation. Recently, a collagen-binding MSCRAMM, ACE, of E. faecaliswas identified (14Rich R.L. Kreikemeyer B. Owens R.T. LaBrenz S. Narayana S.V.L. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26939-26945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ACE has a structural organization similar to that of CNA and contains an N-terminal signal peptide, a collagen binding A region followed by the B region composed of repeated units and in the C terminus an element required for cell wall anchoring, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. The A region of ACE shares sequence similarity with the A region of CNA, and these parts of the two proteins appear to be structurally related as determined by far-UV circular dichroism analysis and computer modeling (14Rich R.L. Kreikemeyer B. Owens R.T. LaBrenz S. Narayana S.V.L. Weinstock G.M. Murray B.E. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26939-26945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). These observations raised the possibility that ACE also contains a trench structure representing the collagen-binding site. Eucaryotic cells also contain collagen-binding adhesion receptors. So far, four collagen-binding integrins have been identified on mammalian cells. These are dimeric proteins and composed of a common β chain (β1) but different and distinct α chains (α1, α2, α10, and α11). The α chains contain a so-called inserted (I) domain that appears to be responsible for the collagen binding activity. The crystal structures of the I domains from α1and α2 have been solved (23Emsley J. King S.L. Bergelson J.M. Liddington R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28512-28517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 24Nolte M. Pepinsky R.B. Venyaminov S.Y. Koteliansky V. Gotwals P.J. Karpusas M.

In both cases these domains contained a putative ligand-binding trench that can accommodate a collagen triple helix. Thus a binding trench may be a common feature of collagen-binding proteins. In the current study, we report on a monoclonal antibody approach to examine the structure-function relationship of CNA-(151–318). Escherichia coli strain JM101 was used as a host and pQE-30 (Qiagen Inc., Chatsworth, CA) as an expression vector for cloning and expressing recombinant proteins.S. aureus strain Cowan I was obtained from the Istituto Sieroterapico Milanese (Milan, Italy) (26Speziale P. Raucci G. Visai L. Switalski L.M. Timpl R. Höök M. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 77-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). E. coli strains were grown in Lennox L broth (LB) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) or on LB agar at 37 °C overnight with antibiotics when appropriate. Staphylococci were grown in Brain Heart Infusion (Difco, Detroit, MI) broth or on Brain Heart Infusion agar at 37 °C overnight. Monoclonal antibodies against CNA-(151–318) were produced essentially as described by Köhler and Milstein (27Kölher G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12737) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. BALB/c mice were injected intraperitoneally five times at 1-week intervals with 50 μg of the purified recombinant protein. The antigen was emulsified with an equal volume of complete Freund's adjuvant for the first immunization, followed by three injections in incomplete adjuvant. The mice were bled, and the sera were tested for reactivity to the purified CNA-(151–318) using ELISA and Western blot. For the final immunization, the antigen was given in saline. Three days later, the lymphocytes were isolated from spleens and fused with Sp2/0 Ag.14 mouse myeloma cells at a ratio of 5:1 using 50% polyethylene glycol 4000. The suspended cells were first grown and selected in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/RPMI 1640 (1:1) medium (Sigma) containing 2% hypoxantine/aminopterin/thymidine (Sigma), 2% glutamine, 2% penicillin, and 2% streptomycin. After 1 week, the hypoxantine/aminopterin/thymidine medium was progressively replaced by culturing cloned hybridomas in a serum-free medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% (v/v) Nutridoma-SR (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) and antibiotics. Supernatants of the cell cultures were screened by ELISA on day 10, and hybridomas positive for the antibodies against CNA-(151–318) were subcultured to a density of 1 cell per well by limiting dilution and further characterized by ELISA and Western blot. 16H9 is a mAb raised against CNA30–531 using the same method. Supernatants of hybridoma cells were collected and centrifuged. The antibodies were purified by using ammonium sulfate precipitation of the supernatant, followed by affinity chromatography on Protein A/G-Sepharose columns according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Isotyping of the produced monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was performed using a Mouse-Typer sub-isotyping kit (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA). DNA preparation, purification, restriction digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, and ligation were performed using standard methods (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or following the manufacturer's instructions unless otherwise stated. Restriction enzymes, T4 DNA ligase, and calf intestine alkaline phosphatase were from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, MD). DNA for sequencing was prepared using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen). Routine preparation of E. coli competent cells and transformation of DNA into E. coli were performed by a one-step procedure (29Chung C.T. Niemela S.Z. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of CNA-(30–531) and ACE-(32–367) were compared using ClustalW with the default parameters. ACE-(152–318) corresponds to CNA-(30–531) and was constructed. Primers were designed to PCR amplify the corresponding nucleotide sequence from ace-(32–367) (TableI) using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Figure 2Effect of different mAbs on the binding of125I-collagen to immobilized CNA -(151–318).Recombinant CNA-(151–318) protein was immobilized onto microtiter wells (1 μg in 100 μl) and probed with 125I-collagen (8 × 104 cpm) in the presence of 2 μg of each mAb. After washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80, binding of the ligand was quantitated by counting the wells in a γ counter. The binding of125I-collagen to CNA-(151–318) in the absence of antibody was set as 100% binding.

Open table in a new tab The primers were designed such that the PCR product contained aBamHI site at its 5′-end and a stop codon followed by aSalI site at its 3′-end. The PCR product was digested withBamHI and SalI and purified. It was then ligated to BamHI- and SalI-digested and -dephosphatased pQE-30 (Qiagen). The ligation mixture was transformed into E. coli JM101, and the cells were incubated on LB agar plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C overnight to select for transformants. The construct was confirmed by restriction enzyme digestions and further verified by DNA sequencing. An overlapping PCR strategy was used for the construction. Primers that span each corresponding junction region between ace-(152–318) andcna-(151–318) were designed (TableII). PCR reactions were carried out using the proper combination of primers and templates (Table II). The construction of chimera L is described here as an example. Briefly, the primer to the 5′-end of ace-(152–318),ace-(152–318) 5′, and ace-(152–318)I, which spans the junction region between ace-(152–318) andcna-(151–318) were used to amplify the N-terminal quarter segment from ace-(152–318). The correspondingcna-(151–318) primers, cna-(151–318)I andcna-(151–318) 3′ were used to amplify the C-terminal three-quarters segment from cna-(151–318). PCR reactions were as described above for the cloning of ace-(152–318). After the reactions, 1 μl of a 5-fold dilution of each reaction were mixed and used as templates for the second round PCR with primers ace-(152–318) 5′ and cna-(151–318) 3′. The PCR product was purified using the Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen), digested with BamHI and SalI, and ligated to pQE30 vector as described above for the cloning oface-(152–318).

Briefly, 1 liter of LB (supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin) was inoculated with 40 ml of an overnight culture of a recombinant E. coli strain and grown at 37 °C for 3 h. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added, and the culture was grown for another 3 h to allow protein expression. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and the cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.4 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and stored at −80 °C. The pellets were thawed and lysed in a French press. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-μm membrane. The supernatant was applied to a 5-ml Ni2+-charged HiTrap chelating column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and bound protein was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–200 mm imidazole in 4 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.9), at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. Fractions corresponding to each recombinant protein, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, were pooled and dialysed against HBS buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 3.4 mm EDTA. Protein concentration was measured on a Beckman DU-70 UV-visible spectrophotometer at λ280–315. The molar extinction coefficient of each protein was calculated using the method of Pace et al. (30Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3452) Google Scholar). A single band of expected molecular weight was observed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis after Coomassie Blue staining for the different chimeras. Microtiter wells were coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl of a 10 μg/ml concentration of each recombinant protein in 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.5. To block additional protein-binding sites, the wells were treated for 1 h at 22 °C with 200 μl of PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then washed five times with PBST (PBS with 0.1% v/v Tween 20). Indicated amounts of each mAb dissolved in 100 μl of PBS with 2% BSA were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h at 22 °C. Plates were then extensively washed with PBST and incubated for 1 h with a rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:500 dilution; Dako, Gostrup, Denmark). After washing, binding was quantitated using the substrateo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and measuring the absorbance at 492 nm in a microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The concentration required for half-maximal binding of the antibody to CNA-(151–318) was used to calculate the apparent KDof each mAb. Type II collagen was prepared from bovine nasal septum as described by Strawich and Nimni (31Strawich E. Nimni M.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3905-3911Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Carrier-free 125I (15 mCi/μg) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Collagen was labeled using the iodogen coated-tube technique as recommended by the manufacturer (Pierce, Rockford, Ill). The specific activity of the radiolabeled ligand was estimated to be 4 × 106 cpm/μg. Microtiter wells were coated with CNA-(151–318) as in ELISA described above and then incubated with 125I-collagen (8 × 104 cpm) in the presence of indicated amounts of each mAb for 1 h. After extensive washing, the radioactivity in each well was measured in a γ-counter. The amount of radioactivity in each well was compared with that bound to the MSCRAMM in the absence of mAb, which was set to 100%. All experiments were done in duplicate. The concentration of each mAb required to inhibit half the binding of collagen to CNA-(151–318) (IC50) was calculated. Binding of 125I-labeled collagen to S. aureus cells was quantitated as described previously (32Switalski L.M. Speziale P. Höök M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21080-21086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 108 S. aureus Cowan I cells were incubated with 5 × 104 cpm of125I-collagen in 0.5 ml of PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 80. The mixture was rotated in an end-over-end mixer for 1 h at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2.5 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 0.1% Tween 80, and the tubes were centrifuged at 1400 × g for 10 min. After aspiration of the supernatant, the radioactivity associated with the cell pellet was determined in a γ-counter. Radioactivity recovered in tubes incubated in the absence of bacteria (400–600 cpm) was considered background and was subtracted from bacteria-containing samples. Duplicate samples were analyzed. To analyze the inhibitory effect of the mAbs on the binding to soluble collagen, bacteria were preincubated with indicated amounts of mAbs for 1 h before the addition of 125I-collagen. The binding assay was carried out as described above. To examine the displacing effect of the mAbs on collagen binding, bacteria were preincubated with 125I-collagen for 1 h. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, the bacteria-collagen pellet was washed and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Tween 80 with indicated amounts of mAb, and incubated for another hour. The amount of residual collagen bound to bacteria was determined as above. Microtiter wells were incubated with 100 μl of 10 μg/ml type II collagen in 50 mm sodium carbonate, pH 9.5, overnight at 4 °C. Remaining protein-binding sites in the wells were blocked by incubating with 200 μl of 2% BSA for 1 h at 22 °C. After washing with PBST, the wells were incubated with 100 μl of a suspension of Cowan I (1 × 107 cells/ml) at 22 °C for 2 h, and then washed extensively with PBST. Adherent cells were detected by incubation of the wells for 1 h with 100 μl of a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG (1:500 dilution), which presumably bound to protein A on the staphylococcal cells. Color development and measurement was as described above. To study the inhibition of bacterial adherence to collagen by the mAbs, cells were preincubated for 30 min with the indicated amounts of antibody. The cells were then transferred to the collagen-coated wells, incubated for 2 h and processed as above. In displacement experiments, bacteria were first incubated in collagen-coated wells for 1 h, and adherent bacteria were then incubated with increasing concentrations of the indicated mAbs for 2 h. Bacteria that remained attached to collagen were detected by the addition of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as described above. As controls for the adherence assay, the adhering bacteria were also detected in selected experiments using crystal violet staining as described previously (33Ni Eidhin D. Perkins S. Francois P. Vaudaux P. Höök M. Foster T.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). The results of the two detection methods were essentially identical. In this study we have analyzed 22 monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant CNA-(151–318) and, mAbs 7E8 and 16H9, raised against the recombinant full-length A region, CNA-(30–529). The isotypes and apparent KD (the concentration required for half maximum binding) were determined by ELISAs (TableIII). The majority of the mAbs were IgG1-κ, six were IgG2a-κ (2B3, 3D3, 7C2, 8H10, 11D5, and 11H11), and one (1F6) was an IgG2b-κ. The majority of the mAbs exhibited similar apparent KDvalues in the 10−9m range, for binding to CNA-(151–318) adsorbed in microtiter wells. 5G4 and 16H9 showed a slightly lower affinity with apparent KD values of 4.2 × 10−8m and 5 × 10−8m, respectively.Table IIISummary of the immunoglobulin isotypes, the apparent KD values of the mAbs, and the concentration required to inhibit 50% of maximum binding of type II collagen to CNA -(151–318)AntibodyIsotypeKDIC50M1F6IgG2b-κ4.5 × 10−93.7 × 10−81H1IgG1-κ1.9 × 10−91.3 × 10−82B1IgG1-κ0.65 × 10−91.1 × 10−82B3IgG2a-κ1.3 × 10−91.0 × 10−83B12IgG1-κ4 × 10−98.6 × 10−83D3IgG2a-κ1.26 × 10−94.2 × 10−85D12IgG1-κ5.8"

Rapid degradation of a Deg1-containing fusion protein is observed only when the reporter is efficiently imported into the nucleus. In contrast, a reporter that is constantly exported from the nucleus exhibits an extended half-life. Furthermore, nuclear import functions are crucial for both Deg1-induced degradation as well as for the turnover of the endogenous Matα2 protein. The conjugation of ubiquitin to a Deg1-containing reporter protein is abrogated in mutants affected in nuclear import. Obviously, the Deg1 signal initiates rapid proteolysis within the nucleoplasm, whereas in the cytosol it mediates turnover via a slower pathway. In both pathways the ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes Ubc6p/Ubc7p play a pivotal role. These observations imply that both the cellular targeting of a substrate and the compartment-specific activity of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system define the half-life of naturally short-lived proteins.

Silver P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Görner W. Schüller C. Ruis H. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 147-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of these factors often occurs by specific proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin system. In a brief and simplified view, the conjugation of substrates with ubiquitin involves the successive action of three classes of enzymes: The E11 or ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2s or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc), and occasionally E3s or ubiquitin-protein ligases. In most cases described in vivo, complexes of E2 and E3 enzymes mediate the specificity of the system. These enzymes catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin chain, which is subsequently recognized by the 26 S proteasome (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar, 4Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Specific protein degradation also relies on features contained in the proteolytic substrate itself. First, a degradation signal has to be present. These signals are transferable sequences or structural features of the target protein, which are in some cases activated by phosphorylation (5Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Second, lysine residues within the substrates form the acceptor sites for the polyubiquitin chain.One of the first and so far best characterized degradation signals is found in the transcriptional repressor Matα2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and was termed Deg1 (6Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This signal comprises the first 67 amino acids of the Matα2 protein, and its recognition involves the E2 enzymes Ubc6p and Ubc7p (7Chen P. Johnson P. Sommer T. Jentsch S. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1993; 74: 357-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that a hydrophobic surface of an amphipathic helix present in Deg1 (amino acids 14–32) is the major structural feature of this signal (8Johnson P.R. Swanson R. Rakhilina L. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1998; 94: 217-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that the Deg1 signal also contains a putative nuclear localization signal (9Hall M.N. Craik C. Hiraoka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Recently, it became evident that the components of the ubiquitin system are not evenly distributed throughout the cell. A prominent example for the compartmentalization of the system is endoplasmicreticulum-associated proteindegradation (ERAD) (10Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Ubc6p and Ubc7p and its membrane receptor Cue1p are also crucial components of ERAD (12Sommer T. Jentsch S.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 13Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 15Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Another proteolytic event, which seems to be restricted to a specific compartment, is the degradation of mitotic regulators. In yeast, the subunits of the involved E3 complex termed anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome are mainly found in the nucleoplasm (16Zachariae W. Shin T.H. Galova M. Obermaier B. Nasmyth K. Science. 1996; 274: 1201-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that the 26 S proteasome is concentrated in and around the nucleus at least in yeast cells (17Enenkel C. Lehmann A. Kloetzel P.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6144-6154Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be clarified in which compartment anaphase-promoting complex-mediated proteolysis actually takes place.Here, we demonstrate for the first time that rapid and specific proteolysis of a short-lived protein is restricted to a certain cellular compartment. Although the full-length Matα2 is an exclusively nuclear protein that is extremely short-lived, the isolated Deg1 signal confers no defined localization to a reporter protein and is degraded with slower kinetics. When a classical SV40 type NLS (18Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar) (termed cNLS) is fused to Deg1 its turnover follows the criteria of Matα2 proteolysis. Thus, a degradation signal has to be combined with localization signals directing it to its native compartment.RESULTSWe wanted to investigate proteolysis initiated by the Deg1 signal with respect to its nuclear cytosolic partitioning. For this purpose, we constructed fusion proteins of the Deg1 signal with GFP. We used a modified form of GFP (yeGFP) (22Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar), which folds rapidly in yeast and thus allows the investigation of short-lived fusion proteins. On its own, yeGFP is a stable protein, which is evenly distributed throughout the cell (data not shown). Passive diffusion of the reporter proteins through the nuclear pore was prevented using a tandem array of two yeGFP moieties.The localization of GFP fusion proteins was monitored with a fluorescence microscope, and protein half-lives were determined in pulse-chase experiments followed by quantification. In no instance, breakdown intermediates have been observed. It is of note that the rates of synthesis as well as the degradation kinetics of the Deg1-GFP fusion protein were similar to those of a previously described Deg1-β-galactosidase reporter, both in wild-type andΔubc6 cells (data not shown). Thus, the generated Deg1-GFP reporter was considered to be a suitable model substrate to study Deg1-dependent proteolysis.First we tested whether the isolated Deg1 degradation signal fused to GFP exhibits the same nuclear localization as the native Matα2 protein. We observed that the endogenous NLS of Deg1 is not sufficient to direct the fusion protein exclusively to the nucleus, which is in agreement with results reported earlier (9Hall M.N. Craik C. Hiraoka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to a GFP-tagged version of the full-length transcription factor Matα2 (Fig. 1 A) and to a cNLS-GFP reporter protein (data not shown), both of which are nuclear proteins, a large portion of Deg1-GFP was found in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we examined whether the half-life of Deg1-GFP would be influenced by this altered localization. To this end, we inserted the cNLS between Deg1 and the GFP segment (Deg1-cNLS-GFP). When expressed in wild-type cells this fusion protein was found exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 1 A). Intriguingly, its turnover was strikingly faster than that observed for Deg1-GFP (Fig. 1 B). To exclude that the inserted cNLS generally destabilizes Deg1-GFP, we replaced this cNLS by a mutant one (K128T) (22Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar). Deg1-GFP containing this nonfunctional cNLS is neither exclusively localized to the nucleus (Fig. 1 A) nor rapidly degraded (Fig. 1 B). Taken together, these data support the idea that nuclear import of a proteolytic substrate may be a prerequisite for efficient degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.Next, we monitored the influence of a block in nuclear import on proteolysis of Deg1-cNLS-GFP. We used two temperature-sensitive yeast mutants, nsp1tsL640S (23Wimmer C. Doye V. Grandi P. Nehrbass U. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 24Nehrbass U. Fabre F. Dihlmann S. Herth W. Hurt E.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 62: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar) andnup49–113 (25Doye V. Wepf R. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 6062-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 26Lee M.S. Henry M. Silver P.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1233-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), in which nuclear import is affected because of mutations in genes encoding components of the nuclear pore complex. Upon shift to the nonpermissive temperature, Deg1-cNLS-GFP was redistributed mainly to the nuclear periphery both innsp1tsL640S and nup49–313cells (data not shown), and its turnover was reduced to the level of Deg1-GFP (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 1 B). Ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation of an ERAD model substrate (CPY*) (10Sommer T. Wolf D.H. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 1227-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Bonifacino J.S. Weissman A.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 19-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar) occurred normally in these mutants (data not shown) indicating that nuclear import did not affect general activities of the proteolytic system. Furthermore, we used the srp1–49 mutant that specifically prevents the nuclear import of proteins carrying the classical SV40 NLS (27Loeb J.D. Schlenstedt G. Pellman D. Kornitzer D. Silver P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this mutant Deg1-cNLS-GFP was relocalized to the cytosol (data not shown), and its turnover was slowed down dramatically (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, proteolysis of Deg1-GFP, which does not contain the cNLS, proceeded as in wild-type cells (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2Rapid Deg1-induced turnover depends on nuclear import functions. A, blockage of nuclear import stabilizes Deg1-cNLS-GFP. Pulse-chase analysis of Deg1-cNLS-GFP at 37 °C comparing wild type with nup49–313 andnsp1tsL640S mutant cells. Prior to pulse labeling cells were shifted for 5 h to the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C. The chart and the calculated half-life show averaged pulse-chase data of three individual experiments.B, ubiquitination of Deg1-cNLS-GFP is absent from a yeast strain defective in nuclear import. Wild-type and mutant strains expressing GFP fusion protein and Myc epitope-tagged ubiquitin as indicated were lysed. GFP was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody. Precipitates were divided and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed using Myc- and GFP-specific antibodies, respectively. Blots were developed with 125I-Protein A. C, degradation of Deg1-cNLS-GFP was monitored by pulse-chase analysis insrp1–49 yeast cells and the corresponding wild type. Prior pulse labeling cells were shifted for 3 h to the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C. In the srp1–49 mutant the turnover of Deg1-cNLS-GFP is slowed down clearly and the fusion protein is mostly redistributed to the cytosol (not shown). D, turnover of Deg1-GFP in srp1–49 yeast cells and the corresponding wild type. Neither degradation of Deg1-GFP nor its cellular distribution (data not shown) is affected in srp1–49 cells.E, degradation of endogenous Matα2 is impaired in nuclear import mutants. Plot of Matα2 degradation in nup49–313and nsp1tsL640S strains is shown. Cells were shifted for 5 h to the nonpermissive temperature of 37 °C prior to pulse labeling. The chart shows averaged pulse-chase data of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide further evidence for a specific degradation pathway of the nucleus we monitored the ubiquitination of Deg1-cNLS-GFP. For this purpose, we expressed an epitope-tagged version of ubiquitin (28Ellison M.J. Hochstrasser M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21150-21157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in wild-type, nup49–313, and pre1–1 (29Heinemeyer W. Kleinschmidt J.A. Saidowsky J. Escher C. Wolf D.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 555-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) cells, the latter of which is affected in proteasomal activities. In the samples prepared from wild-type or the pre1–1 strain we observed ubiquitinated species of Deg1-cNLS-GFP. Surprisingly, we failed to detect such species in nup49–313 cells (Fig. 2 B), indicating that nucleus-specific ubiquitin conjugation pathways are important for the proteolysis of substrates localized to this compartment.So far, all experiments described have been performed with fusion proteins containing the Deg1 signal. To test the physiological relevance of our observations for the degradation of the endogenous Matα2 protein we monitored the proteolysis of this transcription factor in nsp1tsL640S andnup49–313 strains. In both mutants, a clear delay in Matα2 turnover was observed (Fig. 2 E). The degree of stabilization was comparable with that of aΔubc4Δubc6 mutant in our genetic background (data not shown), indicating that nuclear import defects delay a major proteolytic pathway of the Matα2 protein. In addition, the data are consistent with those obtained with the Deg1-cNLS-GFP reporter protein and support the functional significance of a proteolytic pathway specific for Matα2 in the nucleus.All experiments described above point to the fact that nuclear import might be a prerequisite for rapid proteolysis initiated by Deg1. Because Deg1 contains a putative NLS at the very N terminus, fusion proteins of it are, although inefficiently, imported into the nucleus. Therefore, their half-life should increase when import into the nucleus is prevented. To investigate this issue, we mutated the putative endogenous NLS present in the Deg1 signal. In analogy to reported mutations in the cNLS (22Kalderon D. Richardson W.D. Markham A.F. Smith A.E. Nature. 1984; 311: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar) we replaced lysine 3 and 7 with glutamine. In addition, proline 5 was converted into alanine. In wild-type cells, the turnover of this Deg1*-GFP fusion protein was slower than that of Deg1-GFP, although an altered localization of Deg1*-GFP was not observed (data not shown). Transport of Deg1*-GFP into the nucleus by an insertion of a cNLS (Deg1*-cNLS-GFP) led to accelerated proteolysis. However, turnover of this protein was significantly slower than that of Deg1-cNLS-GFP (data not shown). Obviously, the introduced mutations in the N terminus of Deg1 seem to interfere with proper recognition of the degradation signal or with its ubiquitination.Because of the physical linkage of the Deg1 signal and its putative endogenous NLS, we performed an alternative experiment. We inserted a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) specific for the Xpo1 pathway (21Stade K. Ford C.S. Guthrie C. Weis K. Cell. 1997; 90: 1041-1050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) into Deg1-GFP to redirect the imported molecules into the cytosol. As a control, we used Deg1-GFP containing a nonfunctional NES (P12NES) (30Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). Insertion of the NES resulted in nuclear exclusion of the reporter protein whereas P12NES had no influence on the nuclear cytosolic partitioning (Fig. 3 A). The half-life of the NES-containing fusion was slightly but significantly increased, whereas the turnover of the reporter carrying the nonfunctional NES remained unchanged (Fig. 3 B). Taken together these results are consistent with the assumption that at least a small portion of Deg1-GFP is subjected to rapid proteolysis upon entering the nucleus. We therefore proposed the existence of a rapid nuclear and a slow cytosolic degradation pathway specific for the Deg1 signal. To characterize both pathways in more detail we monitored proteolysis of our reporter proteins in various mutants in components of the ubiquitin system. Degradation of both Deg1-cNLS-GFP and Deg1-NES-GFP is dependent on Ubc6p and Ubc7p (Fig. 4, Aand B) but independent of Ubc4p (data not shown). However, the degree of stabilization of the two reporters was different; the fusion protein, which was found mainly in the cytosol, was largely stabilized in the absence of Ubc6p or Ubc7p (roughly 3–7-fold). In contrast, the stabilization was weaker when the reporter protein was efficiently transported into the nucleus (2-fold). Similarly, we found that Deg1-NES-GFP was strongly stabilized inΔcue1 cells (4–5-fold), whereas Deg1-cNLS-GFP had a half-life comparable with that of wild-type cells (Fig. 4,C and D). Thus, the influence of Ubc6p and Ubc7p on the rapid and nucleus-specific Deg1 degradation pathway was much smaller than on the slow cytosolic one. In the case of Cue1p, an influence on the nuclear pathway was hardly measurable.Figure 3Rapid nuclear export decreases degradation of a Deg1-GFP fusion protein. A, localization of Deg1-GFP fusion proteins containing either a nonfunctional (P12) or a functional (NES) nuclear export sequence specific for Xpo1p. Wild-type cells were transformed with plasmids expressing either Deg1-GFP, Deg1-NES-GFP, or Deg1-P12-GFP grown at 30 °C, and fusion protein expression was induced for 4 h. Deg1-NES-GFP is still distributed in the cytosol, but cells mostly display a nuclear exclusion of GFP fluorescence, which is distinct from the distribution of Deg1-GFP. Positions of the nuclei are indicated byarrows. Insertion of the nonfunctional NES (P12) has obviously no influence on the nuclear cytosolic partitioning of Deg1-GFP. B, nuclear export via Xpo1p slows down the degradation rate of Deg1. Pulse-chase analysis (representative sample) of Deg1-GFP, Deg1-NES-GFP, and Deg1-P12-GFP at 30 °C in wild-type cell is shown. The chart and the calculated half-life show averaged pulse-chase data of three individual experiments. The half-life of the NES-containing fusion protein was slightly increased, whereas the turnover of the Deg1 fusion protein carrying the nonfunctional NES (Deg1-P12-GFP) proceeds almost normally.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4Both nuclear and cytosolic Deg1-specific pathways rely on Ubc6p/Ubc7p but differ in their Cue1p dependence. A, turnover of Deg1-NES-GFP is Ubc6p/Ubc7p-dependent with a nearly complete stabilization of the substrate in the deletion strains. Pulse-chase analysis of Deg1-cNLS-GFP degradation in the wild-type strain and in the indicated mutants at 30 °C is shown. The chart and calculated half-life represent averaged data of two individual experiments for the deletion strains. B, degradation of Deg1-cNLS-GFP is still dependent on Ubc6p/Ubc7p. However, the substrate is only partially stabilized in Δubc6 andΔubc7 strains. Kinetic analysis of Deg1-cNLS-GFP turnover in the wild type and in the indicated deletion mutants was performed at 30 °C. Graphical presentation and calculated half-life were performed using mean values of two individual experiments for the deletion strains. C, Cue1p-dependent turnover of the Deg1-NES-GFP fusion parallels that were described for Deg1-β-galactosidase. Chart and half-life calculation represent averaged data from six and four individual experiments, respectively. D, Deg1-cNLS-GFP degradation is independent from Cue1p. In Δcue1cells Deg1-cNLS-GFP fluorescence remains visible in the nucleus and absent from the cytoplasm (data not shown). Graphical presentation and calculation of the half-life were performed using pulse-chase data from six and four individual experiments, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONThe aim of this study was to clarify whether fast and efficient proteolysis of a short-lived protein not only depends on the presence of a degradation signal but also requires a specific localization of the substrate. To investigate this issue, we constructed fusion proteins consisting of GFP and the degradation signal contained in Matα2 termed Deg1. Additional cNLS (classical SV40 type) or leucine-rich NES (specific for the Xpo1 pathway) were introduced to direct them either to the nucleus or to the cytosol. This experimental approach allowed the specific localization of the substrate in wild-type cells without affecting nucleocytoplasmic transport in general, which could result in unspecific secondary effects on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. The generated fusion proteins behaved differently; Deg1-cNLS-GFP and Deg1-NES-GFP were found exclusively in the nucleus and cytosol, respectively. Intriguingly, the cNLS-containing fusion protein is turned over rapidly whereas the NES-containing reporter exhibits an increased half-life compared with Deg1-GFP. Because increased turnover of the substrate correlated with its nuclear localization whereas slow proteolysis correlated with cytosolic localization, we conclude that the Deg1 degradation signal mediates fast proteolysis only in the nucleus. Further support for this idea is provided by the observation that proteolysis of the cNLS-containing fusion protein as well as its ubiquitination is strongly impaired in mutants defective in nuclear import functions. We consider it unlikely that ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis in general is slowed down in these mutants because the degradation of a characteristic ERAD substrate (CPY*) proceeded as expected.The conclusions drawn from the experiments with the Deg1 signal alone are of physiological relevance for the degradation of the Matα2 transcriptional repressor because of the following reasons. First, turnover of the endogenous Matα2 was also delayed in nuclear import mutants. Second, the influence of a Δcue1mutation on Matα2 degradation was significantly lower than that of aΔubc6 or Δubc7 allele. Third, a rapidly exported Matα2-NES-GFP fusion protein displayed a drastically prolonged half-life compared with a similar fusion protein lacking the NES (data not shown). The latter results and those on the Deg1-NES-GFP fusion protein strongly support the hypothesis that the half-life of Matα2 is a function of the time the protein remains in the nucleus.In addition, we observed qualitative differences between cytosolic and nuclear turnover of Deg1-containing fusion proteins. The stabilization of Deg1 caused by a lack of Ubc6p/Ubc7p is stronger in the cytosol than in the nucleus. Similarly, the influence of Cue1p on Deg1-induced proteolysis seems to be minimal in the nucleus, whereas in the cytosol Cue1p plays a crucial role. The slight stabilization of Deg1-cNLS-GFP observed in Δcue1 cells is most likely due to the fact that the level of Ubc7p is altered in these cells (15Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The slow turnover of Deg1-NES-GFP in the cytosol most likely takes place at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane because it was reported that degradation of a Deg1-β-galactosidase fusion protein relied completely on the function of Cue1p and hence on the anchoring of Ubc7 to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (15Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. Science. 1997; 278: 1806-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, Deg1-β-galactosidase degradation was independent of Hrd1p/Der3p and Der1p (data not shown) and thus differed from that of a typical ERAD substrate like CPY*.These differences between turnover in the cytosol and in the nucleus are most likely of physiological importance. If the rapid Matα2 degradative system (t12 = 4 min) (6Hochstrasser M. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1990; 61: 697-708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) would also be active in the cytosol many of the newly synthesized molecules would be degraded before they reach their place of action.Taken together our data demonstrate that the half-life of a protein is determined by specific degradation and localization signals. The dependence on localization signals is probably caused by the restriction of components of the ubiquitin system to certain compartments. For example, a Deg1-recognizing E3 enzyme may be exclusively found in the nucleus and allows rapid turnover solely in this compartment. Without this specificity-conferring component (in the cytosol) Ubc6p/Ubc7p are able to recognize the signal but with lower efficiency. Our data imply that the nucleus is a crucial compartment for Matα2 proteolysis. Other examples have been presented in which nuclear export is also a specific prerequisite for rapid proteolysis (31Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 32Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 33Davarinos N.A. Pollenz R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28708-28715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In cell biological terms, nucleocytoplasmic transport might represent a mechanism to regulate a protein's half-life. By transporting a protein into a different compartment, the turnover might be up- or down-regulated probably because certain components of the ubiquitination cascades are restricted to certain areas within an eukaryotic cell. Rapid inactivation of regulatory factors is an essential step in many central biological processes including cell cycle control and signal transduction (1Hood J.K. Silver P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 2Görner W. Schüller C. Ruis H. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 147-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Down-regulation of these factors often occurs by specific proteolysis mediated by the ubiquitin system. In a brief and simplified view, the conjugation of substrates with ubiquitin involves the successive action of three classes of enzymes: The E11 or ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E2s or ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (Ubc), and occasionally E3s or ubiquitin-protein ligases. In most cases described in vivo, complexes of E2 and E3 enzymes mediate the specificity of the system. These enzymes catalyze the formation of polyubiquitin chain, which is subsequently recognized by the 26 S proteasome (3Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6792) Google Scholar, 4Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar). Specific protein degradation also relies on features contained in the proteolytic substrate itself. First, a degradation signal has to be present. These signals are transferable sequences or structural features of the target protein, which are in some cases activated by phosphorylation (5Laney J.D. Hochstrasser M. Cell. 1999; 97:"
https://openalex.org/W2135480993,"Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP) is a member of the interferon regulatory factors (IRF) that has a pivotal role in mediating resistance to pathogenic infections in mice and in promoting the differentiation of myeloid cells. ICSBP exerts some of its transcriptional activities via association with other factors that enable its binding to a variety of promoters containing DNA composite elements. These interactions are mediated through a specific COOH-terminal domain termed IAD (IRF association domain). To gain a broader insight of the capacity of ICSBP to interact with other factors, yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using ICSBP-IAD as a bait against a B-cell cDNA library. Trip15 was identified as a specific interacting factor with ICSBP in yeast cells, which was also confirmed by in vitro glutathioneS-transferase pull-down assays and by coimmunoprecipitation studies in COS7 cells. Trip15 was recently identified as a component of the COP9/signalosome (CSN) complex composed of eight evolutionary conserved subunits and thus termed CSN2. This complex has a role in cell-signaling processes, which is manifested by its associated novel kinase activity and by the involvement of its subunits in regulating multiple cell-signaling pathways and cell-cycle progression. We show that in vitroassociation of ICSBP with the CSN leads to phosphorylation of ICSBP at a unique serine residue within its IAD. The phosphorylated residue is essential for efficient association with IRF-1 and thus for the repressor activity of ICSBP exerted on IRF-1. This suggests that the CSN has a role in integrating incoming signals that affect the transcriptional activity of ICSBP.

These factors mediate numerous biological activities such as, anti-viral activity, IFN signaling, and immunomodulation (1Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 293-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). IRFs are expressed in many cell types and tissues except for IFN consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP, also termed IRF-8) and IRF-4, which are expressed specifically in immune cells. IRFs act as transcriptional repressor or activator and the current data suggest that they harbor dual function. This dual functionality is in part due to interactions with different transcription factors resulting in the ability to interact with various promoters leading to alteration in transcriptional activities,i.e. repression or activation (for review, see Ref. 1Mamane Y.

Ablation of ICSBP expression results in mice that are deficient in Th1-mediated immune response. Consequently, these mice are susceptible to certain parasitic, bacterial, and viral infections (5Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P. Gabriele L.

This is attributed in part to lack of interleukin-12 expression thought to be regulated by ICSBP (6Giese N.A. Gabriele L. Doherty T.M. Klinman D.M. Tadesse-Heath L. Contursi C. Epstein S.L.

These deficient mice also exhibit a chronic myelogenous leukemia-like syndrome suggesting that ICSBP functions as a tumor suppressor gene (5Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P. Gabriele L. Waring J.F. Bachmann M.F. Zinkernagel R.M. Morse III, H.C. Ozato K. Horak I. Cell. 1996; 87: 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the fact that low levels of ICSBP transcripts were reported in blood samples of chronic myelogenous leukemia patients (8Schmidt M. Nagel S. Proba J. Thiede C. Ritter M. Waring J.F. Rosenbauer F. Huhn D. Wittig B. Horak I. Neubauer A. Blood. 1998; 91: 22-29Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ICSBP binds to promoters that contain IFN stimulable response element following interaction with IRF-1 or IRF-2 and acts as a transcriptional repressor (9Bovolenta C. Driggers P.H. Marks M.S.

In addition, ICSBP interacts with non-IRF transcription factors like PU.1 and E47 forming transcriptional activation complexes on different composite DNA elements (11Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J.

Our studies revealed that all these associations are mediated by a conserved domain in ICSBP termed IRFs association domain (IAD) that is shared by all other IRFs excluding IRF-1 and IRF-2, which interact with ICSBP. IRF-4, which is the most conserved IRF member to ICSBP, also interacts with PU.1 and E47 through the IAD but unlike ICSBP it does not interact with IRF-1 and IRF-2 (11Eisenbeis C.F. Singh H. Storb U. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1377-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 13Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4639-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the IAD is also essential for the association of ISGF3γ/IRF-9, a non-tissue-restricted IRF member, with Stat1 and Stat2 to form the ISGF3 complex, which plays a pivotal role in IFN type I signaling (15Veals S.A. Santa Maria T. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, different IRFs utilize the IAD for specific interactions with other factors. This suggests that IRFs-IAD modules are spatially organized like a key lock mechanism; i.e. the overall structure is similar and is determined by conserved residues, while non-conserved residues dictate the specificity of interactions. Accordingly, a point mutation within IRFs-IAD in a conserved leucine to proline (Leu331 in ICSBP-IAD) was able to ablate the interactions of ICSBP with IRF-1, IRF-2, PU.1, and E47, the interaction of IRF-4 with PU.1 and E47 (12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar), and the interaction of ISGF3γ with Stat1 and Stat2. 2D. E. Levy, personal communication.2D. E. Levy, personal communication. This is consistent with a detailed mutational analysis of IRF-4 demonstrating that conserved polar amino acids within two predicted α-helices present in the IAD are essential for protein-protein interactions (16Ortiz M.A. Light J. Maki R.A. Assa-Munt N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2740-2745Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).The ability of various transcription factors to form combinatorial complexes with different biological activities is a hallmark of eukaryotic gene regulation. Protein-protein interactions play crucial roles in the activity of IRFs and different protein complexes were reported in various immune cells (10Sharf R. Azriel A. Lejbkowicz F. Winograd S.S.

Immunol. 1999; 162: 7417-7425PubMed Google Scholar). Since ICSBP has an important role in immune cells, we searched for other possible interacting factors that can recruit ICSBP to different promoters or affect its transcriptional activity. Therefore, yeast two-hybrid screens were performed in which the IAD of ICSBP was used as bait against a B-cell cDNA library. Among the specifically interacting clones was Trip15, originally identified in a similar screen as a thyroid receptor β and retinoid X receptor interacting protein in a ligand-dependent manner (19Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Trip15 is conserved between plants, insects, and mammals and was recently identified as a component of a 26 S proteasome lid-like complex termed COP9/signalosome (CSN); Trip15 was therefore termed CSN2 (20Seeger M.

The CSN complex is composed of 8 subunits and was originally identified as a repressor of light controlled development in Arabidopsis thaliana (22Wei N. Chamovitz D.A. Deng X.W. Cell. 1994; 78: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In animals, this complex is localized both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus, and possesses an associated unidentified kinase activity which specifically phosphorylates signaling molecules such as, IκBα, p105, and c-Jun (20Seeger M.

Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that the phosphorylated residue is essential for efficient interaction with IRF-1. The possible role of ICSBP-CSN interaction in IFN signaling is discussed.DISCUSSIONICSBP is an essential transcription factor conferring resistance to pathogenic infections through the activation of Th1-dependent (5Holtschke T.

In addition, ICSBP acts as a tumor suppressor gene essential for proper differentiation of myeloid cells (5Holtschke T. Lohler J. Kanno Y. Fehr T. Giese N. Rosenbauer F. Lou J. Knobeloch K.P.

These combinatorial interactions render ICSBP the ability to bind to numerous promoters containing composite DNA elements leading to different transcriptional activities. We have shown that the interactions are mediated through a specific conserved domain at the carboxyl terminus termed IAD (12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H.

In this article, ICSBP-IAD was used as bait to screen for other interacting factors in a B-cell cDNA library. CSN2 was identified as a strong and specific interacting factor in this yeast two-hybrid screen. A mutation in a conserved leucine to proline within the IAD of ICSBP that ablated the interaction with IRF and non-IRF transcription factors (12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar) also ablated the interaction with CSN2 in the yeast cells. The interaction between the two factors was also confirmed in vitro by GST pull-down assay and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation studies.CSN2 is highly conserved from fission yeast through invertebrate, plants, and mammals where it is constitutively expressed in different tissues and as shown here in various hematopoietic cell lines (36Wei N. Tsuge T. Serino G. Dohmae N. Takio K. Matsui M. Deng X.W. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 919-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alien is the Drosophila orthologue for CSN2 that is expressed in muscle attachment sites during embryogenesis (31Goubeaud A. Knirr S. Renkawitz-Pohl R. Paululat A. Mech. Dev. 1996; 57: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In mice, CSN2 (Cops2) was mapped to chromosome 2 and the reported mRNA sizes were 4 and 2.3 kb (21Schaefer L. Beermann M.L. Miller J.B. Genomics. 1999; 56: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Blast homology search against the current GenBankTM revealed that CSN2(Trip15) is located on chromosome 21q22.1 (GenBankTM accession number AP000028) and a closely related gene is located on chromosome 9 (GenBankTM accession number AC007172). However, blast search against the current htgs (high-throughput genomic sequences) data also shows that the highest homologous gene is located on chromosome 15q21.2 (GenBankTM accession number AC013452) a location that was predicted following the mouse chromosome mapping (21Schaefer L. Beermann M.L. Miller J.B. Genomics. 1999; 56: 310-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This suggests that in humans CSN2 (Trip15) was duplicated relatively late in evolution. In human cell lines, three mRNA bands with molecular sizes of 5.2, 4.6, and 2.6 kb were observed, which were not equally expressed in all the examined cell lines (Fig. 1). This might reflect the existence of three CSN2 (Trip15) loci in the human genome. Two isoforms for CSN7 were identified in mammals (37Wei N. Deng X.W. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 98-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and taken together with the presence of multiple CSN2 genes it suggests that CSN may incorporate different isoforms that will render it different characteristics.Previously, we have shown that IRF-2 and IRF-1 interacts with ICSBP through a conserved module termed IAD2 (12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar). IAD2 is a predicted PEST domain and therefore rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) residues (38Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). PEST domains were originally believed to be involved in controlling protein instability and in targeting proteins for proteolytic degradation (39Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem.

However, some PEST domains can mediate protein-protein interactions as shown initially for the formation of the DNA binding heterocomplex between PU.1 and IRF-4 or ICSBP (12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar, 40Perkel J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 241-252PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we identified two PEST domains in E47 and speculated that one PEST domain confers protein instability and the other is essential for the interaction with ICSBP (12Meraro D. Hashmueli S. Koren B. Azriel A. Oumard A. Kirchhoff S. Hauser H. Nagulapalli S. Atchison M.L. Levi B.Z. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6468-6478PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, using the algorithm for searching potential PEST sequences (PESTfind (38Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar)), the first 60 amino acids of CSN2 were also predicted as a strong PEST domain with a very high score of +10.18. This domain scored much higher than the PU.1 PEST domain and in the same range as that of IRF-1 and IRF-2 (+7.71 for IRF-1, +9.44 for IRF-2, and only +2.15 for PU.1). Each of these PEST domains are of similar size, i.e. 42 amino acids in PU.1, and about 55 amino acids in IRF-1 and IRF-2. In the predicted PEST domain of CSN2, the first seven amino acids are not essential for interaction since they were missing from our original yeast two-hybrid clone and were not included in the GST fusion construct. These observations further demonstrate that the IAD of ICSBP interacts effectively with factors that contain PEST motifs.Unlike the interaction of ICSBP with either IRF-1 and IRF-2, which led to transcriptional repression, and the interaction with PU.1 and E47, which led to transcriptional activation, the interaction with CSN2 had no detectable effect on ICSBP transcriptional activity and its ability to bind DNA either alone or together with IRF-1 or PU.1 (data not shown). This suggests that the interaction with CSN2 do not exert an immediate influence on the transcriptional capacity of ICSBP or its ability to bind DNA. During the course of this research, CSN2 (Trip15) was identified as a component of the highly conserved CSN complex. At least in vitro, this complex has been shown to promote phosphorylation via associated kinase activity that phosphorylates signaling molecules like c-Jun, p105 (the precursor of NFκB), and IκBα (20Seeger M. Kraft R. Ferrell K. Bech-Otschir D. Dumdey R. Schade R. Gordon C. Naumann M. Dubiel W. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Here we show that under similar conditions, the CSN complex is capable of phosphorylating ICSBP at Ser260, which is located within its IAD. In addition, we show that ICSBP co-migrates with the CSN on a glycerol gradient demonstrating its tight association with the complex probably via the interaction with CSN2. Previously, we have shown that phosphorylation events modulate the ability of ICSBP to interact with other IRFs and to bind DNA (14Sharf R. Meraro D. Azriel A. Thornton A.M. Ozato K. Petricoin E.F. Larner A.C. Schaper F. Hauser H. Levi B.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9785-9792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In agreement with this, it is demonstrated here that Ser260 is essential for the repressor activity of ICSBP exerted on IRF-1 and for the efficient interaction between the two factors. Since this residue is a nonconserved residue within the IAD it represents a unique phosphorylation site for ICSBP not shared by any other IRF member. The mutation in Ser260 does not affect the interaction of ICSBP with E47 and PU.1 (data not shown) suggesting that this residue is essential for the interaction between ICSBP with other IRFs thereby leading to transcriptional repression. Furthermore, phosphorylation events modulate the activity of both IRF-3 and IRF-7 following viral infection. These IRFs are phosphorylated at the carboxyl terminus by an unidentified cytoplasmic serine kinase leading to their translocation to the nucleus and the subsequent transcriptional activation (41Lin R. Heylbroeck C. Pitha P.M. Hiscott J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2986-2996Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 42Marie I. Durbin J.E. Levy D.E.

In analogy, we show here that specific serine phosphorylation in ICSBP by the CSN leads to enhanced repressor activity.Some of the CSN subunits have a role in cell-signaling processes. The largest identified subunit, CSN1 (also termed FUS6 or GPS1), was shown to inhibit JNK1 (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) (44Spain B.H. Bowdish K.S. Pacal A.R. Staub S.F. Koo D. Chang C.Y. Xie W. Colicelli J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6698-6706Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). CSN2 (Trip15) was identified as an interacting component with thyroid hormone receptor and retinoic X receptor (19Lee J.W. Choi H.S. Gyuris J. Brent R. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 243-254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with characteristics of a corepressor of nuclear hormone receptor superfamily (45Dressel U. Thormeyer D. Altincicek B. Paululat A. Eggert M. Schneider S. Tenbaum S.P. Renkawitz R. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3383-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and c-Jun activation (23Naumann M. Bech-Otschir D. Huang X. Ferrell K. Dubiel W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35297-35300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CSN 5, also known as JAB1, JUN activation domain-binding protein 1, was reported to interact with c-Jun and coactivate JUN-mediated gene expression (46Claret F.X. Hibi M. Dhut S. Toda T. Karin M. Nature. 1996; 383: 453-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Subunit 6 is identical to VIP (human HIV-1 Vpr interacting protein) that has a role in cell-cycle progression (47Mahalingam S. Ayyavoo V. Patel M. Kieber-Emmons T. Kao G.D. Muschel R.J. Weiner D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3419-3424Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Taken together with CSN associated kinase activity, this suggests that the complex is functioning as a multicomponent signaling complex. A postulated role of CSN in modulating ICSBP activity is illustrated in Fig. 8. Both ICSBP and CSN are co-localized in the nucleus (24Wei N. Deng X.W. Photochem. Photobiol. 1998; 68: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 45Dressel U. Thormeyer D. Altincicek B. Paululat A. Eggert M. Schneider S. Tenbaum S.P. Renkawitz R. Baniahmad A. Mol. Cell.

ICSBP is a constitutively expressed transcription factor in hematopoietic cells, and can be present either in an unphosphorylated form or retained by the CSN complex in an “inactive state.” Upon pathogenic infection or IFN stimulation of immune cells, IRF-1, which is an immediately induced gene, exerts transcriptional activation on IFN stimulatable response element containing promoters (49Miyamoto M. Fugita T. Kimura Y. Maruyama M. Harada H. Sudo Y. Miyata T. Taniguchi T. Cell. 1988; 54: 903-913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). Since ICSBP is either unphosphorylated or retained by the CSN2, it cannot interact effectively with IRF-1 and therefore does not exert repression activity. A somewhat delayed response to the incoming signal may lead to the phosphorylation of ICSBP on Ser260 by the CSN-associated kinase activity leading to its dissociation from the complex and the subsequent interaction with IRF-1 resulting in effective repression. Since both IRF-1 and ICSBP have pivotal roles in immune cells and exert negating activities, the interaction with CSN might serve as a novel mechanism to modulate ICSBP activity. A similar mechanism has been recently shown for another component of the CSN, Jab1, which interacts with the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitory protein p27Kip1 leading to its translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and enhancing its degradation (50Tomoda K. Kubota Y. Kato J. Nature. 1999; 398: 160-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In analogy, COP1 is a repressor of photomorphogenic development inArabidopsis. It is thought that the CSN complex protects COP1 from proteasome degradation in the dark. The light inactivates the complex resulting in a block of nuclear import, accelerated nuclear export, and subsequent degradation of COP1 (for review, see Ref. 51Osterlund M.T. Ang L.H. Deng X.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 113-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interaction of the CSN with c-Jun via CSN5/Jab1 leads to the subsequent phosphorylation, enhanced stability, and increased transcriptional activity of c-Jun (20Seeger M. Kraft R.

Here we investigated mechanisms of SHP-2 recruitment within the PRLR signaling complex. Using SHP-2 and PRLR immunoprecipitation studies in 293 cells and in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11, we found that SHP-2 co-immunoprecipitates with the PRLR and that the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR plays a regulatory role in both the tyrosine phosphorylation and the recruitment of SHP-2. Our results further indicate that SHP-2 association to the PRLR occurs via the C-terminal SH2 domain of the phosphatase. In addition, we determined that the newly identified adaptor protein Gab2, but not Gab1, is specifically tyrosine phosphorylated and is able to recruit SHP-2 and phosphatidyinositol 3-kinase in response to PRLR activation. Together, these studies suggest the presence of dual recruitment sites for SHP-2; the first is to the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR and the second is to the adaptor protein Gab2.

Ligand stimulation induces receptor dimerization, which leads to the activation of the constitutively associated Jak2 kinase as well as members of the Src family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (1Clevenger C.V. Medaglia M.V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 674-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Sorensen P. Sheffield L.G. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 241: 710-713Google Scholar). Activated Jak2 molecules phosphorylate themselves as well as receptor subunits on tyrosine residues creating docking sites for SH2 domain containing proteins belonging to various signaling pathways. Activated PRLR can induce the activation of the Stat5 (signal transducer andactivator of transcription 5), mitogen-activated protein kinase, and PI3-K pathways and the activation of several signaling regulatory proteins including the SHP-2 (the SH2 domain containing protein-tyrosinephosphatase-2). SHP-2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein that is characterized by having two N-terminally located SH2 domains and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The phosphatase plays a critical role in cell growth and differentiation as evidenced by the early embryonic lethality in SHP-2−/− mice (3Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J.

We have previously shown that SHP-2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to PRL stimulation and physically associates with the PRLR·Jak2 complex. We also determined that SHP-2 is a positive mediator of PRLR signaling leading to the activation of β-casein gene promoter (7Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A.

Therefore, it appears that certain cytokines are able to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of both Gab1 and Gab2, whereas others may utilize one member only. In this study, we investigated the sites and mechanisms of SHP-2 recruitment to the PRLR. We determined that the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR is a site for SHP-2 recruitment. In addition, we determined that Gab2 but not Gab1 is tyrosine phosphorylated following PRL stimulation of mammary cells and that Gab2 presents a second site for SHP-2 recruitment to the PRLR signaling complex.

Cells were then induced by incubating them for 3 days in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, insulin (5 μg/ml), and hydrocortisone (1 μm) (30Merlo G.R. Graus-Porta D. Cella N. Marte B.M.

The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford technique. The human embryonic 293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (4.5 g/liter glucose) (Bio Media) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. Approximately 5 × 105 cells were plated then co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding the different forms of PRLR (1 μg each), SHP-2 (1 μg), and the kinase Jak2 (0.25 μg) by the calcium phosphate technique. After 24 h of expression, the cells were starved by serum deprivation overnight. Transiently co-transfected 293 cells were stimulated with ovine PRL (1.5 μg/ml) for 5 min and then lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm sodium floride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulphonyl floride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin) for 5 min at 4 °C. The lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. Protein concentration was measured using the Bradford technique. Equal amounts of protein obtained by total lysis were loaded and run on an 8% SDS-PAGE. Immunoprecipitations were performed on endogenous or overexpressed cell lysates. Extracts were immunoprecipitated for 2 h (or overnight for endogenous proteins) using specific antibodies (SHP-2, PRLR, HA, Gab1, and Gab2) and protein A-Sepharose beads. Precipitates were then washed with HNTG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol) and separated on SDS-PAGE. Western blotting analysis was performed using the indicated antibodies. Proteins were revealed using chemiluminescence (Super Signal kit from Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. We have previously reported that the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR is critical for the induction of the prolactin responsive β-casein gene (29Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and the activation of Stat5 (32Ali S. Ali S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7709-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In addition, a positive role for SHP-2 in the activation of Stat5 and the induction of early genes has also been reported (7Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 33Berchtold S. Volarevic S. Moriggl R. Mercep M. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 556-567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesized a regulatory role for the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR in the activation of SHP-2. To test this hypothesis, we used various natural, mutant, and deletion forms of the PRLR for the purpose of focusing on the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR. The long form of the PRLR has nine intracellular tyrosine residues. The PRLR Nb2 form, found in Nb2 T-lymphoma cells, has an in-frame deletion mutation that removes six of the nine intracellular tyrosine residues found in the long form leaving tyrosine residues 237, 309, and 382 (34Ali S. Edery M. Pellegrini I. Lesueur L. Paly J. Djiane J. Kelly P.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1242-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). The C-terminal tyrosine 382 of the PRLR Nb2 form corresponds to tyrosine 580 of the PRLR long form. Another deletion form that is capable of inducing β-casein gene expression is the PRLR Nb2 mutant form Δ296–322 (29Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This receptor form has a 27-amino acid internal deletion and lacks tyrosine 309. Tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutants of the membrane proximal (LY237F, NY237F, and ΔY237F) and the C-terminal tyrosines (LY580F, NY382F, and ΔY382F) in the long form, Nb2 form, and the Δ296–322 mutant form were described previously (29Lebrun J.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7709-7716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Finally, the PRLR Nb2 mutant form Δ243–268 is also used in our studies as a negative control (29Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This mutant receptor is unable to associate with Jak2 kinase because of the deletion of the proline-rich interaction domain and is incapable of signaling in response to PRL stimulation (29Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Goffin V. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4031-4035Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 35Lebrun J.J. Ali S. Ullrich A. Kelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10664-10670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR on SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation, the human embryonic kidney 293 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids that encode the phosphatase SHP-2 and either the wild type long form PRLR, the tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutants of the membrane proximal tyrosine LY237F, or the C-terminal tyrosine LY580F (Fig. 1 A). Another set of 293 cells was transfected with expression plasmids encoding SHP-2 and either the wild type intermediate Nb2 form of the PRLR, tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant of the membrane proximal tyrosine NY237F or the C-terminal tyrosine NY382F. In addition, expression plasmids encoding the Δ296–322 mutant form of the Nb2 receptor and tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant of the membrane proximal tyrosine ΔY237F or the C-terminal tyrosine mutant ΔY382F were co-transfected into 293 cells (Fig. 1 B). In addition to the PRLR and SHP-2, 293 cells were transfected with a limited amount of an expression plasmid for Jak2 tyrosine kinase (see “Experimental Procedures”). SHP-2 was immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates using polyclonal antibodies for SHP-2. Precipitates were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with monoclonal antibodies for phosphotyrosine in a Western blot. As expected, no SHP-2 phosphorylation was detectable in samples expressing the deletion mutant Δ243–268 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, a strong phosphorylation of SHP-2 was detected in the samples expressing the wild type long form of the PRLR and also in samples expressing both the membrane proximal mutant LY237F and the C-terminal mutant LY580F (Fig. 1 A). Moreover, SHP-2 phosphorylation was also detectable in the samples expressing the wild type Nb2 form of the PRLR and the membrane proximal mutant NY237F (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, however, no SHP-2 phosphorylation was detected in samples expressing the C-terminal mutant of the Nb2 form of the PRLR receptor NY382F (Fig. 1 B). Similarly, tyrosine phosphorylation levels of SHP-2 were comparable in samples expressing the Δ296–322 form as well as its corresponding tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants ΔY237F (Fig. 1 B). In agreement with the results obtained for the PRLR Nb2 form, SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation was lost in the sample expressing the C-terminal mutant of the Δ296–322 form, ΔY382F (Fig. 1 B). The loss of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in samples expressing the C-terminal tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants of the PRLR suggests that this tyrosine plays a regulatory role in SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation. The sustenance of SHP-2 phosphorylation in the samples expressing the C-terminal tyrosine mutation in the long form of the PRLR suggests that in addition to the C-terminal tyrosine, one or more of the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues that are present in the long form of the PRLR but absent form the Nb2 form of the PRLR may play a role in SHP-2 phosphorylation. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with a monoclonal antibody to SHP-2 in a Western blot analysis to confirm equal expression of the phosphatase (Fig. 1, A and1 B, lower panels). the loss of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation in samples expressing the C-terminal tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant of the PRLR suggests that this tyrosine may act as a recruitment site for SHP-2. To determine whether SHP-2 associates to the PRLR, we initially examined this association in the PRL-responsive mammary epithelial cell line HC11. The PRLR was immunoprecipitated using the U6 monoclonal antibody against the PRLR from the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11 that were induced and starved then were either left untreated or treated with PRL for 10 min (see “Experimental Procedures”). Immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blotted with monoclonal antibody against SHP-2 in a Western blot analysis. PRL stimulation of HC11 cells induces a specific association between SHP-2 and the PRLR (Fig. 2 A). To confirm the association of SHP-2 to the PRLR and to determine whether the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR is a site for SHP-2 recruitment, the receptor was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells transiently transfected with expression plasmids encoding SHP-2, the Nb2 form of the PRLR, NY237F, NY382F, Δ296–322, ΔY237F, and ΔY382F and a limited amount of an expression vector encoding Jak2 kinase. Immunoprecipitates were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with a monoclonal antibody against SHP-2 in Western blotting. No SHP-2 was detectable in samples expressing the control Δ243–268 deletion form of the PRLR (Fig. 2 B). A clear SHP-2 co-immunoprecipitation with the PRLR was detectable in samples expressing the wild type Nb2 form, NY237F, Δ296–322, and ΔY237F (Fig. 2 B). However, no co-immunoprecipitating SHP-2 was detectable with the PRLR complexes in the samples expressing the C-terminal tyrosine to phenylalanine mutants NY382F and ΔY382F (Fig. 2 B). Altogether, these results indicate that the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR is a site for SHP-2 association. No detectable decrease in the association between SHP-2 and the PRLR was observed in samples expressing the C-terminal tyrosine to phenylalanine mutant of the long form of the PRLR LY580F (data not shown). The sustenance of SHP-2 tyrosine phosphorylation and association to the PRLR with the C-terminal mutant of the long form of the PRLR suggests that there is redundancy in SHP-2 association to the PRLR long form where one or more of the tyrosine residues that are only present in the long form of the PRLR can provide additional association sites for SHP-2. The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 has two N-terminally located SH2 domains. To determine the mechanism of association between SHP-2 and the PRLR, the ability of the two SH2 domains to bind to phosphotyrosine motifs was interrupted by point mutations that substitute the critical arginine in the SH2 domain to lysine. 293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids for either the Δ243–268 deletion form of the PRLR along with SHP-2 wild type or the Nb2 form of the PRLR with SHP-2 wild type, the arginine to lysine mutant of the N-terminal SH2 domain, SHP-2 R32K mutant, or the C-terminal SH2 domain SHP-2 R138K mutant (7Ali S. Chen Z. Lebrun J.J. Vogel W. Kharitonenkov A. Kelly P.A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition, cells were co-transfected with an expression plasmid for the kinase Jak2. Cellular lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation of the PRLR using the U6 monoclonal antibody. The immune complexes were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with monoclonal antibodies to SHP-2 (Fig. 3). Both wild type SHP-2 and the SHP-2 K32R mutant forms can be detected co-immunoprecipitating with the PRLR. In contrast, SHP-2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with the PRLR in samples expressing the SHP-2 R138K mutant. Therefore, SHP-2 interacts with the C-terminal tyrosine of the PRLR through the C-terminal SH2 domain. To investigate the individual roles of the N- and C-terminal SH2 domains of SHP-2 in regulating tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the phosphatase, total cellular lysates obtained from the same transfection described above were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then blotted with antibodies to phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 3 (middle panel) tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was observed in samples expressing wild type SHP-2 as well as SHP-2 R32K. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2 was lost in the sample expressing SHP-2 R138K (Fig. 3, middle panel), further indicating the importance of the C-terminal SH2 domain of SHP-2 for recruitment to the PRLR and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP-2. The membrane was stripped and then reblotted with a monoclonal antibody against SHP-2 to confirm equal expression of the protein (Fig. 3,lower panel). The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2 is known to associate with multiple tyrosine phosphorylated proteins. To examine the different possible associations of SHP-2 with tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in response to PRLR activation, we performed SHP-2 immunoprecipitations in the mouse mammary epithelial cell line HC11. These cells were grown to confluency, induced to differentiate, and starved for 48 h. Then the cells were either unstimulated or stimulated with PRL for 5, 10, and 20 min. Cellular lysates were prepared for immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody to SHP-2. The immune complexes were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and then Western blotted with a monoclonal antibody to phosphotyrosine. As shown in Fig. 4, SHP-2 is tyrosine phosphorylated in the basal condition in HC11 cells. However, there is a clear increase in its phosphorylation state following PRL stimulation. Furthermore, in these immunoprecipitates of SHP-2, we observe a number of tyrosine phosphorylated proteins, including proteins in the range of 95–110 kDa, co-precipitating with SHP-2. Two of these proteins having molecular masses of 180 and 110 kDa are constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. However, a protein of 95 kDa undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to PRL stimulation. Together, these data indicate that SHP-2 interacts with multiple tyrosine phosphorylated proteins in mammary epithelial cells. Recently a family of proteins that have molecular sizes in the range of 95–110 kDa called the Gab (Gab1 and Gab2) family of adaptor proteins was identified. These proteins were reported to be tyrosine phosphorylated and to recruit SHP-2 within the signaling complexes for several receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors. Therefore, we intended to determine whether members of the Gab family of proteins are involved in PRLR-mediated signaling and whether they are able to recruit SHP-2 in response to PRLR activation. T"
https://openalex.org/W2023259159,"Ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of specific target proteins is required for several important steps during the cell cycle. Degradation of such proteins is strictly cell cycle-regulated and triggered by two large ubiquitin ligases, termed anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and Skp1/Cullin/F-box complex (SCF). Here we show that yeast Ran-binding protein 1 (Yrb1p), a predominantly cytoplasmic protein implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport, is required for cell cycle regulated protein degradation. Depletion of Yrb1p results in the accumulation of unbudded G1cells and of cells arrested in mitosis implying a function of Yrb1p in the G1/S transition and in the progression through mitosis. Temperature-sensitive yrb1-51 mutants are defective in APC-mediated degradation of the anaphase inhibitor protein Pds1p and in degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Sic1p, a target of SCF. Thus, Yrb1p is crucial for efficient APC- and SCF-mediated proteolysis of important cell cycle regulatory proteins. We have identified the UBS1 gene as a multicopy suppressor of yrb1-51 mutants. Ubs1p is a nuclear protein, and its deletion is synthetic lethal with a yrb1-51 mutation. Interestingly, UBS1 was previously identified as a multicopy suppressor of cdc34-2 mutants, which are defective in SCF activity. We suggest that Ubs1p may represent a link between nucleocytoplasmic transport and ubiquitin ligase activity.

We suggest that Ubs1p may represent a link between nucleocytoplasmic transport and ubiquitin ligase activity. anaphase-promoting complex cyclin-dependent kinase Ran-binding protein Skp1/Cullin/F-box hemagglutinin green fluorescent protein There are three major transitions in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the G1/S transition when cells commit to replicate their genome, the metaphase to anaphase transition, when sister chromatids are separated, and the exit from mitosis, when the mitotic spindle is depolymerized and cytokinesis occurs. For efficient proliferation, cells must ensure the correct order of these events. Therefore, execution of these processes is tightly controlled.One important cell cycle regulator is the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1p, also called Cdc28p (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). Cdk1p is active only in association with a member of either the B-type cyclins Clb1-6p or the G1 cyclins Cln1-3p. Another important mechanism of cell cycle control is regulated protein degradation (2Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Jorgensen P. Tyers M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Such proteins are targeted for proteolytic destruction by the formation of covalently linked chains of ubiquitin molecules. The final step of this fusion process, the ligation of activated ubiquitin to the substrate, is catalyzed by ubiquitin ligases. Two of these ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase enzymes are essential for cell cycle progression: the anaphase-promoting complex (APC),1 also called cyclosome, and the Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) complex.Components of the SCF complex are Skp1p, the cullin protein Cdc53p, the ring finger protein Hrt1p, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p, and one of several F-box proteins such as Cdc4p (4Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 5Willems A.R. Goh T. Taylor L. Chernushevich I. Shevchenko A. Tyers M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 1533-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SCF is constantly active throughout the cell cycle, but ubiquitination of specific SCF substrates is regulated by substrate phosphorylation. An essential role of SCF is the destruction of Sic1p, which is an inhibitor specific for Cdk1p associated with B-type cyclins (6Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). At the G1/S transition, G1 cyclins Cln1p and Cln2p accumulate and activate Cdk1p to phosphorylate Sic1p (6Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Sic1p is then rapidly degraded by the SCF complex (5Willems A.R. Goh T. Taylor L. Chernushevich I. Shevchenko A. Tyers M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 1533-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 7Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Thereby, Cdk1p associated with S phase cyclins Clb5p and Clb6p becomes active and triggers DNA replication.APC is a large protein complex that consists of at least 12 subunits inS. cerevisiae and is highly conserved in eukaroytes (8Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 9Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). At the metaphase to anaphase transition, APC triggers sister chromatid separation by targeting the anaphase inhibitor Pds1p for destruction (10Cohen-Fix O. Peters J.M. Kirschner M.W. Koshland D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 3081-3093Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). APC is also required for the mitotic exit. It triggers degradation of B-type cyclins leading to the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases (9Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 11Zachariae W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).Several yeast strains that are mutated in essential components of the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery do not stop cell cycle progression randomly but show distinct cell cycle arrest phenotypes, predominantly in the G2/M phase. Such strains arecse1 (12Xiao Z. McGrew J.T. Schroeder A.J. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4691-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), srp1 (13Loeb J.D. Schlenstedt G.

One of these mutants, srp1-31, was demonstrated to be defective in degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb2p (13Loeb J.D. Schlenstedt G. Pellman D. Kornitzer D. Silver P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).A crucial component for nuclear transport in all eukaryotes is the small Ras-like GTPase Ran, which exists in a GTP- and a GDP-bound form (16Goldfarb D.S. Science. 1997; 276: 1814-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 17Gorlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 18Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Ran is present both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, but the two Ran pools differ with respect to their GTP/GDP binding state; because of a cytosolic Ran GTPase activating protein (Ran-GAP), cytosolic Ran is predominantly in its GDP-bound form. In the nucleus, Ran is kept in its GTP-bound form by the action of a nuclear Ran guanine-nucleotide exchange factor. Apparently, this asymmetric distribution of the two forms of Ran is the driving force for nucleocytoplasmic transport.Most of the nuclear protein transport is mediated by a large superfamily of transport receptors, which are classified either as importins or as exportins, depending on the transport direction (19Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 20Adam S.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Importins and exportins differ with respect to the affinity for their substrates in the presence of RanGTP. Importins bind their substrate in the cytoplasm, where Ran-GTP is largely absent, and facilitate transport through the nuclear pore complex. In the nucleus, RanGTP binds to importin and thereby triggers the release of the substrate from the importin (21Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar, 22Gorlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), which is then transported back into the cytoplasm.Exportins bind their substrates cooperatively with RanGTP to form a trimeric complex (23Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar), which passages through the nuclear pore complex. Cytoplasmic dissociation of both RanGTP/importin and of RanGTP/exportin/cargo complexes requires the cytosolic Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1) (24Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G. Nature. 1993; 366: 585-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Binding of RanBP1 to RanGTP appears to trigger the transient formation of a RanGTP/RanBP1 dimer. In this dimer, RanGTP is accessible to RanGAP, which mediates GTP hydrolysis and renders complex disassembly irreversible (25Bischoff F.R. Gorlich D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 249-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 26Floer M. Blobel G. Rexach M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19538-19546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Thus, RanBP1 appears to be a crucial factor for the recycling of transport factors and, as a consequence, for nuclear protein transport mediated by some of these receptors.The yeast homologue of the RanBP1 is encoded by the essentialYRB1 (yeast RanBP1) gene (27Butler G. Wolfe K.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1219: 711-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 28Ouspenski II Mueller U.W. Matynia A. Sazer S. Elledge S.J. Brinkley B.R. J. Biol.

Silver P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5367-5378Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). 2M. Künzler, J. Trueheart, C. Sette, E. Hurt, and J. Thorner, submitted for publication. 2M. Künzler, J. Trueheart, C. Sette, E. Hurt, and J. Thorner, submitted for publication. Like other mutants implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport, temperature-sensitiveyrb1 mutants were shown to be impaired in cell cycle progression (14Ouspenski II Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).In this study, we show that cells depleted of Yrb1p arrest either in G1 or in mitosis. These cell cycle defects prompted us to analyze whether Yrb1p is required for ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation during the cell cycle. We demonstrate thatyrb1-51 cells are impaired in proteolysis of crucial cell cycle regulatory proteins. The anaphase inhibitor Pds1p, a target of the APC and the CDK inhibitor Sic1p, whose degradation is normally triggered by the SCF, are both stabilized in these mutants. In a screen for high copy suppressors of yrb1-51, we have identifiedUBS1, which was previously identified as a putative positive regulator of Cdc34p, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme associated with SCF. Our data imply that Ran-binding protein Yrb1 is important for cell cycle-regulated proteolysis mediated by both the APC and SCF ubiquitin ligases and that Ubs1p may influence both the Ran pathway and ubiquitin ligases.DISCUSSIONIn this paper, we have analyzed the role of the Ran-binding protein 1 (Yrb1) in cell cycle progression in budding yeast. Yrb1p is a predominantly cytoplasmic protein implicated in nuclear import and export. A crucial role of Yrb1p in nucleocytoplasmic transport is thought to be the release of nuclear transport receptors from RanGTP in the cytoplasm. Thereby, Yrb1p is needed for the terminal step of nuclear export and for the recycling of import receptors (46Kehlenbach R.H. Dickmanns A. Kehlenbach A. Guan T. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 645-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar).A Role for Yrb1p in Cell Cycle-regulated ProteolysisWe found that depletion of Yrb1p results in a cell cycle arrest either in G1 phase or in mitosis, and temperature-sensitiveyrb1-51 mutants fail to release from G1 or M phase arrests at their restrictive temperature. These data confirm and extend previous findings showing that mutants in Yrb1p display cell cycle arrest phenotypes (14Ouspenski II Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 171-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of specific target proteins is essential for cell cycle progression, we have particularly examined the role of Yrb1p in degradation of key regulatory proteins. We have shown here thatyrb1-51 mutants fail to degrade the anaphase inhibitor protein Pds1p, a substrate of the APC. Furthermore, mutant cells are sensitive against high levels of the mitotic cyclin Clb2p and thereby resemble mutants in the APC. We found that yrb1-51 mutants are also impaired in degradation of an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases, Sic1p, a target of the SCF complex (Fig. 5), and another substrate of SCF, the transcription factor Gcn4p, is also stabilized in these mutants. 3R. Pries, personal communication. We conclude from these results that Yrb1p plays an important role in cell cycle-regulated proteolysis mediated by both the APC and SCF ubiquitin ligases.It was previously demonstrated that mutants in SRP1, encoding the yeast homologue of importin α, were unable to properly degrade Clb2p, suggesting that the nuclear import pathway is required for cyclin proteolysis (13Loeb J.D. Schlenstedt G. Pellman D. Kornitzer D. Silver P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In contrast to yrb1-51,srp1-31 arrest predominantly in G2/M phase upon shift to their restrictive temperature, which may indicate that this importin is particularly important for proteolysis during mitosis. Our data imply that disruption of the Ran cycle stabilizes not only APC substrates but also SCF targets. Furthermore, cells lacking functional Yrb1p are impaired in the G1/S transition and in progression through mitosis.What could be the role of cytoplasmic Yrb1p in ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation? The findings thatsrp1 and yrb1 mutants are both impaired in this process implies that the obvious reason for this phenotype is their defect in nucleocytoplasmic transport. Impaired nuclear import or export may cause defects in ubiquitin ligase activity, for example by mislocalization of crucial components or regulators of the ubiquitination machinery. Alternatively, target proteins of ubiquitin ligases may be stabilized because they are not transported to locations where the ubiquitination machinery is active. At least in the case of the APC, which triggers the separation of sister chromatids, it is obvious that the important function of this ubiquitin ligase resides in the nucleus (9Zachariae W. Nasmyth K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2039-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). However, it is yet unknown whether the activity of ubiquitin ligases is restricted to a specific cellular compartment.Another reason for the defect in proteolysis may be an impaired function of the proteasome. Indeed, recent findings showed that biogenesis of the 20 S proteasome depends on a functional nuclear protein import pathway. 4C. Enenkel, personal communication. As a consequence, cell cycle regulatory proteins targeted for destruction by ubiquitin ligases may get abnormally stabilized in yrb1-51mutants, because the proteasome is not properly active.It is also tempting to speculate that Yrb1p may have other important functions than in Ran-mediated transport. Independently of their role in nuclear transport, Ran and RanBP1 were found to be involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle in mammalian cells. RanGTPase apparently regulates the assembly of the mitotic spindle in a transport-independent manner (47Carazo-Salas R.E. Guarguaglini G. Gruss O.J. Segref A. Karsenti E. Mattaj I.W. Nature. 1999; 400: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 48Kalab P. Pu R.T. Dasso M. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 481-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 49Azuma Y. Dasso M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It was also observed that RanBP1 levels oscillate during the cell cycle in mammalian cells and increased levels of RanBP1 disrupted various cell cycle events, such as the assembly of the mitotic spindle (41Battistoni A. Guarguaglini G. Degrassi F. Pittoggi C. Palena A. Di Matteo G. Pisano C. Cundari E. Lavia P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2345-2357PubMed Google Scholar).It is unknown whether yeast Yrb1p has additional functions besides nucleocytoplasmic transport. Overexpression of YRB1and of GSP1 (the yeast RanGTPase) leads to an increased sensitivity toward the microtuble depolymerizing drug benomyl and to increased chromosome nondisjunction (28Ouspenski II Mueller U.W. Matynia A. Sazer S. Elledge S.J. Brinkley B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1975-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that cells arrested in mitosis because of the absence of Yrb1p displayed an abnormal mitotic spindle (Fig. 1 C). Thus, abnormal levels of Yrb1p, either increased or decreased, affect mitotic events, and these observed phenotypes might indicate that RanBP1 is important for spindle function also in lower eukaryotes.Although Yrb1p is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm and nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis does not occur in this organism during mitosis, recent findings suggested that this Ran-binding protein may have a function in the nucleus. It was shown that Yrb1p shuttles between cytoplasm and nucleus (50Kunzler M. Gerstberger T. Stutz F. Bischoff F.R. Hurt E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4295-4308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 51Plafker K. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3510-3521Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be shown whether its transient localization in the nucleus is important for Yrb1p function.Ubs1p, a Link of Yrb1p to Ubiquitin Ligase Activity?In a screen for multi-copy suppressors of the yrb1-51 mutation, we have identified the UBS1 gene that may represent a link between the Yrb1p and ubiquitin ligases. Interestingly, UBS1was initially identified as a multi-copy suppressor of cdc34mutants (45Prendergast J.A. Ptak C. Kornitzer D. Steussy C.N. Hodgins R. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cdc34p is an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme associated with SCF, and mutants in this essential gene are defective in SCF function causing a drastic stabilization of SCF target proteins such as Sic1p. Ubs1p has no homology to any other gene, and its function is unknown. Because high levels of Ubs1p suppressed the lethality ofcdc34 mutants, it was suggested that Ubs1p represents a putative positive regulator of Cdc34 (45Prendergast J.A. Ptak C. Kornitzer D. Steussy C.N. Hodgins R. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Interestingly, high copyUBS1 plasmids suppressed only some cdc34mutations but failed to suppress certain cdc34 mutations in a specific region on the surface of the proteins. Because this surface sequences resembled a region in Ubs1p itself, it was suggested that Ubs1p might directly bind to Cdc34p and thereby regulate its activity by interaction or by modification. However, such an interaction has not yet been demonstrated.A deletion of UBS1, which has no obvious effect on wild-type cells, is deleterious to both cdc34 (45Prendergast J.A. Ptak C. Kornitzer D. Steussy C.N. Hodgins R. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) andyrb1-51 mutants at semipermissive temperatures. Thus, cells in which either Cdc34p or Yrb1p function is partially impaired are entirely dependent on Ubs1p. All these observations imply that Ubs1p promotes the function of both Yrb1p and Cdc34p.A GFP-Ubs1 fusion protein is localized to the nucleus (Fig. 7 E), and this nuclear localization is at least partially impaired in yrb1-51 mutants (data not shown). As suggested by Prendergast et al. (45Prendergast J.A. Ptak C. Kornitzer D. Steussy C.N. Hodgins R. Goebl M. Ellison M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), Ubs1p might be an activator of Cdc34p, and its nuclear import triggered by the RanGTP cycle may be important for proper SCF function in the nucleus. However, this simple explanation would not explain why high levels of Ubs1p also suppressyrb1-51 mutant cells. An alternative model, in which Ubs1p influences both nuclear transport and ubiquitin ligase activity, may be more likely. For example, Ubs1p may have a role in promoting nucleocytoplasmic transport and thereby accelerate nuclear localization of proteins, which induce SCF activity. The presence of high levels of this activatory protein then may cause suppression of a partially inactive Yrb1p. Accelerated transport by high levels of Ubs1p may then cause the nuclear accumulation of proteins that promote Cdc34/SCF activity leading to suppression of the cdc34 mutant. Such a model would explain why Ubs1p affects both yrb1 andcdc34 mutants.Nucleocytoplasmic Transport and the Regulation of Cell Cycle EventsAlthough it is possible that Yrb1p has essential roles other than nuclear import and export, cell cycle defect of mutants in several factors involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, such assrp1, sac3, and cse1 mutants, suggests that functional transport is crucial for cell cycle progression. Mutants in the importin-α gene, SRP1, display defects in mitosis and cyclin proteolysis (13Loeb J.D. Schlenstedt G. Pellman D. Kornitzer D. Silver P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7647-7651Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Sac3p, a protein localized to the nuclear pore, is implicated in the progression through mitosis (15Jones A.L. Quimby B.B. Hood J.K. Ferrigno P. Keshava P.H. Silver P.A. Corbett A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3224-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cold-sensitive cse1-1 mutants, defective in the nuclear export receptor gene of Srp1p, arrest as large budded cells (12Xiao Z. McGrew J.T. Schroeder A.J. Fitzgerald-Hayes M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4691-4702Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and its mammalian homologue, CAS, was also implicated in mitosis (52Ogryzko V.V. Brinkmann E. Howard B.H. Pastan I. Brinkmann U. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9493-9500Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).It is tempting to speculate that proteolysis of cell cycle regulatory proteins may be controlled by subcellular localization either of components of the destruction machinery or of the target proteins themselves. An example for regulated nuclear localization of a cell cycle regulatory protein is the transcription factor Swi5p. Swi5p is cytoplasmic until late anaphase, when it suddenly enters the nucleus and induces the transcription of late mitotic genes (53Moll T. Tebb G. Surana U. Robitsch H. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1991; 66: 743-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 54Knapp D. Bhoite L. Stillman D.J. Nasmyth K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5701-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Swi5p by cyclin-dependent kinases prevents nuclear entry, and only the appearance of an antagonizing phosphatase, Cdc14p, allows nuclear import of Swi5p (55Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Cdc14p is itself a well characterized example for regulated localization during the cell cycle. This phosphatase required for the mitotic exit is localized to the nucleolus for most of the cell cycle, and thereby it is kept inactive (56Shou W. Seol J.H. Shevchenko A. Baskerville C. Moazed D. Chen Z.W. Jang J. Charbonneau H. Deshaies R.J. Cell. 1999; 97: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 57Visintin R. Hwang E.S. Amon A. Nature. 1999; 398: 818-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). The release during anaphase allows Cdc14p to reach its targets, Swi5p, Sic1p, and Cdh1p, and the dephosphorylation of each of these proteins contributes to inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases and the mitotic exit (11Zachariae W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 708-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar).In analogy to these proteins, the regulated localization of components of the destruction machinery may be a possible mechanism to ensure a precisely controlled degradation of target proteins, which is crucial for faithful cell cycle progression. To identify such regulatory proteins whose activity is controlled by nucleocytoplasmic transport is a task for future experiment. There are three major transitions in the cell cycle of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae: the G1/S transition when cells commit to replicate their genome, the metaphase to anaphase transition, when sister chromatids are separated, and the exit from mitosis, when the mitotic spindle is depolymerized and cytokinesis occurs. For efficient proliferation, cells must ensure the correct order of these events. Therefore, execution of these processes is tightly controlled. One important cell cycle regulator is the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1p, also called Cdc28p (1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar). Cdk1p is active only in association with a member of either the B-type cyclins Clb1-6p or the G1 cyclins Cln1-3p. Another important mechanism of cell cycle control is regulated protein degradation (2Hershko A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 788-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 3Jorgensen P. Tyers M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 610-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Such proteins are targeted for proteolytic destruction by the formation of covalently linked chains of ubiquitin molecules. The final step of this fusion process, the ligation of activated ubiquitin to the substrate, is catalyzed by ubiquitin ligases. Two of these ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase enzymes are essential for cell cycle progression: the anaphase-promoting complex (APC),1 also called cyclosome, and the Skp1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) complex. Components of the SCF complex are Skp1p, the cullin protein Cdc53p, the ring finger protein Hrt1p, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p, and one of several F-box proteins such as Cdc4p (4Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 5Willems A.R. Goh T. Taylor L. Chernushevich I. Shevchenko A. Tyers M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 1533-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SCF is constantly active throughout the cell cycle, but ubiquitination of specific SCF substrates is regulated by substrate phosphorylation. An essential role of SCF is the destruction of Sic1p, which is an inhibitor specific for Cdk1p associated with B-type cyclins (6Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). At the G1/S transition, G1 cyclins Cln1p and Cln2p accumulate and activate Cdk1p to phosphorylate Sic1p (6Schwob E. Bohm T. Mendenhall M.D. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1994; 79: 233-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated Sic1p is then rapidly degraded by the SCF complex (5Willems A.R. Goh T. Taylor L. Chernushevich I. Shevchenko A. Tyer"

The inhibitory activity of kallistatin is abolished upon heparin binding. The loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin containing clusters of basic amino acid residues has been identified as a heparin-binding site. In this study, we investigated the role of the basic residues in this region in tissue kallikrein inhibition. Kallistatin mutants containing double Ala substitutions for these basic residues displayed a 70–80% reduction of association rate constants, indicating the importance of these basic residues in tissue kallikrein inhibition. A synthetic peptide derived from the sequence between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin was shown to suppress the kallistatin-kallikrein interaction through competition for tissue kallikrein binding. To further evaluate the function of this loop, we used α1-antitrypsin, a non-heparin-binding serpin and slow tissue kallikrein inhibitor as a scaffold to engineer kallikrein inhibitors. An α1-antitrypsin chimera harboring the P3-P2′ residues and a sequence homologous to the positively charged region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin acquired heparin-suppressed inhibitory activity toward tissue kallikrein and exhibited an inhibitory activity 20-fold higher than that of the other chimera, which contained only kallistatin's P3-P2′ sequence, and 2300-fold higher than that of wild-type α1-antitrypsin. The α1-antitrypsin chimera with inhibitory characteristics similar to those of kallistatin demonstrates that the loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin is crucial in tissue kallikrein inhibition, and this functional loop can be used as a module to enhance the inhibitory activity of a serpin toward tissue kallikrein. In conclusion, our results indicate that a positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of a serpin can accelerate the association of a serpin with tissue kallikrein by acting as a secondary binding site.

Most of the family members act as inhibitors for serine proteinases and regulate a variety of physiological processes by inhibiting their target proteinases (1Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory activity of a serpin is determined primarily by its protruding reactive center loop that docks into the reactive cleft of its target proteinase and traps the enzyme in a covalent complex (2Plotnick M.I. Mayne L. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7586-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For some serpins, a secondary binding site remote from the reactive center loop is required for proteinase inhibition (3Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. Stone S.R.

The secondary binding sites interact with complementary sites and often promote the interaction between a serpin and its target proteinase. Another functional structure affecting the inhibitory specificity of a serpin is the heparin-binding site. For most of the heparin-binding serpins, heparin binding accelerates the association of serpins with their target proteinases (9Griffith M.J. J. Biol.

For development of specific and potent inhibitors of serine proteinases, it is essential to identify the structural elements related to the inhibitory activity and understand the orchestration of these structural elements on the inhibition. Kallistatin is a serpin that specifically inhibits human tissue kallikrein by forming a covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex (18Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high selectivity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein is attributed to its unique Phe-Phe pair at the P2-P1 residues in the reactive center (19Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in press.Google Scholar). Kallistatin is also one of the heparin-binding serpins (18Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which include antithrombin, protease nexin I, heparin cofactor II, plasminogen activator inhibitor, and protein C inhibitor (PCI).1 Unlike most heparin-binding serpins whose inhibitory activities are accelerated by heparin, the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein is abolished upon heparin binding (18Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heparin-suppressed effect is also observed in tissue kallikrein inhibition by PCI (20Ecke S.

Heparin-binding sites of serpins are composed of clusters of basic residues that bind to the acidic groups of heparin (21Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J.R.

Compared with other serpins, kallistatin has a distinct heparin-binding site localized in the region between the H helix and the C2 sheet (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). The heparin-binding sites of kallistatin and PCI are close to each other in primary structure. However, the major heparin-binding residues K312:K313 of kallistatin are located at the N terminus of the C2 sheet, whereas the major heparin-binding residues R269:K270 of PCI are located in the H helix. Additionally, amino acid sequence alignment of serpins shows that kallistatin has a unique insertion of 3–4 residues in the loop between the H helix and C2 sheet. A molecular model of kallistatin indicates that these extra residues may bulge the loop toward the reactive center loop (19Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in press.Google Scholar). The basic amino acid residues K312:K313 in this loop are thus positioned in close vicinity to the reactive site (Fig. 1). We therefore hypothesize that the positively charged region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin could have a direct involvement in the interaction with tissue kallikrein in addition to heparin binding. In the present study, we investigated the role of the basic residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin in tissue kallikrein inhibition by three approaches. First, we evaluated the association rates of tissue kallikrein with kallistatin variants containing double Ala substitutions for these basic residues in this loop. Second, we used a synthetic peptide derived from the sequence between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin to assess its capability to compete with kallistatin for tissue kallikrein binding. Finally, we created chimeric α1-antitrypsin, which harbors the P3-P2′ sequence and a sequence homologous to the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin, to evaluate the effect of this positively charged loop on tissue kallikrein inhibition. α1-Antitrypsin was used as a scaffold because it has neither heparin binding activity nor significant inhibitory activity toward tissue kallikrein. This study provides evidence that the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin acts as a secondary binding site to accelerate the interaction of kallistatin and tissue kallikrein. Escherichia coli strain TOP10 and the pTrc-His B expression vector were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA), restriction enzymes and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD), Taq polymerase was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Norwalk, CT), nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid- agarose was from Qiagen (Santa Clarita, CA), POROS®HE/1 and QE columns were from PerSeptive Biosystems (Cambridge, MA), heparin (150 units/mg) was from The Upjohn Co. (Kalamazoo, MI), andd-Val-Leu-Arg-methylcoumarinamide was from Enzyme System Products (Livermore, CA). Human tissue kallikrein was purified as described previously (27Shimamoto K. Chao J. Margolius H.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1980; 51: 840-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), and synthetic peptides were synthesized and provided by Dr. L. Juliano (Department de Biofisica, Escola Paulista de Medicima, San Paulo, Brazil). The kallistatin variants K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A were designed to contain Ala substitutions for the basic amino acid residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet. K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A were created, expressed, and purified by the method described previously (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). A synthetic peptide, HC2, was designed according to the sequence between the H helix and C2 sheet spanning amino acids 300–319, RWNNLLRKRNFYKKLELHLPK. The basic residues are underlined. A negative control C4 peptide derived from the surface region around the C4 sheet was synthesized, spanning amino acids 222–242, PFISSRTTPKDFYVDENTTV. All synthetic peptides were dissolved in 2% Me2SO for use. 125I-labeled human tissue kallikrein (1 × 104 cpm/20 μl) was preincubated with different concentrations of synthetic peptide at 37 °C for 10 min. The concentrations of the HC2 peptide in the assay were 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μm; and the concentrations of the control peptide, C4, were 100, 200, 300, and 400 μm. The reaction mixtures were then incubated with 0.5 μm kallistatin for 1 h. The reaction mixtures were resolved in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by autoradiography. The α1-antitrypsin cDNA was synthesized from total RNA of human hepatocytes by reverse transcription-PCR with the primers 5′-ATGCCGTCTTCTGTCTCG-3′ and 5′-TTATTTTTGGGTGGGATT-3′. After gel purification and phosphorylation of the PCR product, the full-length α1-antitrypsin cDNA was cloned into pBluescript. A previous report showed that deletion of 5–10 amino acids from the N terminus of α1-antitrypsin increased recombinant protein expression without affecting the inhibitory activity of α1-antitrypsin (28Johansen H. Sutiphong J. Sathe G. Jacobs P. Cravador A. Bollen A. Martin R. Shatzman A. Mol. Biol. Med. 1987; 4: 291-305PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the α1-antitrypsin cDNA with an 8-codon deletion from the N terminus was synthesized by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotide 5′-AGGTGCTAGCCAGAAGACAGATAC-3′ (harboring a NheI site as indicated by the underlined residues) and the T7 promoter as primers and the full-length α1-antitrypsin cDNA as template. After the cDNA was cut with NheI and EcoRI, it was cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pTrc His linearized by the same restriction enzymes. The pTrc His vector adds a hexa-histidine sequence at the N terminus of a recombinant protein for purification by metal-affinity chromatography. The addition of a hexa-histidine sequence for purification was applied in many studies that showed no effect on the inhibitory activity of serpins (29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar, 30Jiang H. Mulnix A.B. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 25: 1093-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two α1-antitrypsin chimeras, denoted as α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H, were created by site-directed mutagenesis using a sequence overlap-extension PCR method. α1-AT/KS was constructed with the P3-P2′ sequence of kallistatin, and α1-AT/KS/H was engineered with not only the P3-P2′ sequence but also with a sequence homologous to the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin using α1-antitrypsin as a scaffold. To create α1-AT/KS, the α1-antitrypsin cDNA in pBluescript was used as a template, with oligonucleotides 5′-GAGGCCAAATTCTTCTCTGCACCCCCCGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGGGGGGTGCAGAGAAGAATTTGGCCTC-3′ as internal primers (mutant bases are indicated by the underline) and oligonucleotides 5′-AGGTGCTAGCCAGAAGACAGATAC-3′ and the T7 promoter primer as outside primers in the PCR. The mutant cDNA synthesized by PCR is digested by NheI/EcoRI and cloned into the pTrc His expression vector. The chimera α1-AT/KS/H was created by the same method using the first chimera as template and oligonucleotides 5′-CCTGGAAAATCTCAAGAAGCGTTTCTACAGAAGGTCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGACCTTCTGTAGAAACGCTTTTGAGATTTTCCAGG-3′ as internal primers. The inserted and mutated nucleic acids are underlined. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The methods for expression of the mutants were the same as those described previously (29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). The recombinant α1-antitrypsin was first purified by nickel-affinity chromatography (29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). After dialysis against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 20 mm NaCl, the sample was loaded onto an anion-exchange chromatography column (QE column) in a BioCADTM SPRINT TM Perfusion Chromatography System. The recombinant protein was eluted with a NaCl gradient ranging from 20–500 mm. The peak fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Tissue kallikrein binding activity of the α1-antitrypsin chimeras was assessed by the tissue kallikrein binding assay in the presence of different concentrations of heparin. The chimeras (0.6 μm) were preincubated with different concentrations of heparin (0, 10, 30, and 50 units/ml, respectively) in 8 μl of 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 10 min. 125I-labeled tissue kallikrein (1 × 104 cpm/μl; 2 μl) was added into the reaction mixtures, which were then incubated at 37 °C for 2.5 h. The samples were resolved on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and analyzed by autoradiography. The tissue kallikrein binding activity of α1-antitrypsin chimeras was also compared with that of kallistatin and α1-antitrypsin in the absence or presence of 50 units/ml heparin under the same conditions. The effects of heparin on the inhibitory activity of the α1-antitrypsin chimeras were analyzed by preincubating of the chimeras (0.36 μm) with 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 units/ml heparin in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 (45 μl), at 37 °C for 10 min. The reactions were then started by adding 5 μl of 2 ng/μl tissue kallikrein (final concentration, 6 nm) to the reaction mixtures and incubating them at 37 °C for 3.5 h. The residual tissue kallikrein activity was determined by adding 20 μl of the reaction mixture in 2 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 30 μmVal-Leu-Arg-methylcoumarinamide. The rate of substrate hydrolysis was monitored at 380 nm excitation and 460 nm emission. The association rate constants of α1-antitrypsin chimeras (α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H) and kallistatin mutants (K307A/K308A and K312A/K313A) were determined according to the method described previously (29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). We have localized the heparin-binding site of kallistatin in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet by showing that both K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A kallistatin mutants have reduced heparin binding capacity and less sensitivity to the heparin-suppressed effect on tissue kallikrein inhibition (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). Kallistatin mutants K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A containing double Ala substitutions for the basic amino acid residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet were created using kallistatin P1Arg as a scaffold. To investigate the importance of these basic residues in the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein, we measured the association rate constants (ka) of the kallistatin mutants and kallistatin P1Arg with tissue kallikrein. As shown in TableI, the kaof the mutants K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A were markedly reduced to 1.1 × 104 and 8.0 × 103m−1 s−1, which were only 35% and 21% of the ka (3.9 × 104m−1s−1) for kallistatin P1Arg (29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). Kinetic analysis of the inhibitory activity of these mutants indicates that the basic amino acid residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet are crucial for the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein.Table IComparison of the association rate constants (ka) of kallistatin P1Arg and the mutants containing mutations in the heparin-binding site for tissue kallikreinka (m−1 s−1)Kallistatin (P1Arg)3.9 × 104 1-aAccording to Chen et al.

To determine whether the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin can bind to tissue kallikrein, a synthetic peptide HC2 derived from this region was used to compete with kallistatin for tissue kallikrein binding in a kallistatin-kallikrein binding assay. The results showed that the HC2 peptide interfered with the complex formation of tissue kallikrein and kallistatin (Fig. 2). The HC2 peptide at 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 μmcompeted with 0.5 μm kallistatin in a dose-dependent manner for tissue kallikrein binding and reduced the intensity of the band around 85 kDa representing the tissue kallikrein-kallistatin complex (Fig. 2 A). The control peptide C4, derived from the surface region around the C4 sheet, did not significantly affect the formation of the kallistatin-kallikrein complex even at concentration as high as 400 μm (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that the region covering the H helix and C2 sheet in kallistatin can bind to tissue kallikrein. To further investigate the role of the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin in tissue kallikrein inhibition, we engineered serpin chimeras using α1-antitrypsin as a scaffold. α1-Antitrypsin has no known heparin binding activity, and it is a very slow progressive inhibitor of tissue kallikrein with aka of 7.7 m−1s−1, which is more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of kallistatin (31Geiger R. Stuckstedte U. Clausnitzer B. Fritz H. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Many studies have shown that substitution of the reactive center residues of a serpin changes its inhibitory specificity (32Patston P.A. Gettins P.G.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 72: 166-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 33Djie M.Z. Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16268-16273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We first constructed a α1-antitrypsin chimera α1-AT/KS containing kallistatin's reactive center sequence by replacing the P3-P2′ sequence of α1-antitrypsin (IPMSI) with that of kallistatin (KFFSA) (Fig. 3). Using α1-AT/KS as a backbone, the other chimera, α1-AT/KS/H, was engineered with a positively charged sequence homologous to the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin. The region between the H helix and C2 sheet in α1-antitrypsin contains fewer basic residues (only R305:R306) as compared with kallistatin, which contains R306:K307:R308 and K312:K313 in this region. In addition, α1-antitrypsin harbors many acidic residues, such as Asp301, Glu303, and Asp304, in this region that may affect the binding of this region with negatively charged molecules, such as heparin. Another feature we consider a critical factor is a 4-residue insertion in this region in kallistatin compared with α1-antitrypsin. According to a molecular model of kallistatin, we speculate that this insertion may protrude the loop between the H helix and C2 sheet in a more accessible conformation for interaction with other proteins (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). Based on these concerns, we introduced a LKKRFYRR sequence homologous to the heparin-binding sequence of kallistatin to replace EDRR in this region for α1-antitrypsin. This substitution accommodates 3 additional basic amino acids, 4 extra amino acid residues, and replacement of the acidic residues Glu303 and Asp304 (Fig. 3). By this sequence modification, a structural element imitating the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin was created in α1-antitrypsin. The histidine-tagged α1-antitrypsin was purified by nickel-affinity chromatography to over 95% homogeneity as estimated by Coomassie Blue staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The samples of α1-antitrypsin chimeras, however, still contained contaminating proteins after processed by a nickel-affinity column. The samples were further purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The chimeras α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H were eluted by 170–190 and 100–130 mm NaCl, respectively. The recombinant proteins were able to reach 95% purity. To determine whether the α1-antitrypsin chimeras, α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H, gain tissue kallikrein binding activity and heparin-suppressed inhibitory activity, a tissue kallikrein binding assay was carried out in the presence or absence of heparin. The results showed that both α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H were able to form an 85-kDa complex with human tissue kallikrein in the absence of heparin (Figs. 4 and5). The complex formation between tissue kallikrein and α1-AT/KS, which contained only the P3-P2′ sequence of kallistatin, was not affected by heparin, even at a concentration as high as 50 units/ml (Fig. 4). In contrast, the complexes formed between tissue kallikrein and α1-AT/KS/H, which carried a homologous heparin-binding sequence of kallistatin in addition to the P3-P2′ sequence, were inhibited by heparin in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4). Wild-type α1-antitrypsin failed to form a detectable complex with tissue kallikrein even in the absence of heparin under the experimental conditions, whereas α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H, like kallistatin, exhibited remarkable kallikrein binding activity (Fig. 5). α1-AT/KS/H appeared to act more like kallistatin because its tissue kallikrein binding activity was suppressed by heparin (Fig. 5). These results indicate that α1-antitrypsin can acquire tissue kallikrein binding activity and heparin-regulated activity by incorporation of the P3-P2′ sequence and a homologous heparin-binding site of kallistatin between the H helix and C2 sheet.Figure 5Comparison of the tissue kallikrein binding activity of kallistatin, wild-type α1-antitrypsin, and the α1-antitrypsin chimeras in the absence or presence of heparin. The tissue kallikrein binding assay for kallistatin, wild-type α1-antitrypsin, and the α1-antitrypsin chimeras, α1-AT/KS and α1-AT/KS/H, was performed in the absence or presence of heparin at a concentration of 50 units/ml.

The results are shown in Fig. 6. After incubation for 3.5 h in the absence of heparin, the enzymatic activity of tissue kallikrein was completely inhibited by α1-AT/KS/H, and about 86% of the enzymatic activity was inhibited by α1-AT/KS. Preincubation with heparin at 10 units/ml suppressed the inhibitory activity of α1-AT/KS/H and restored >90% of tissue kallikrein activity. However, α1-AT/KS was not significantly affected by heparin, even at a high concentration of 50 units/ml, because it still inhibited approximately 80% of tissue kallikrein activity. The results indicate that the insertion of the homologous heparin-binding site of kallistatin between the H helix and C2 sheet confers heparin-suppressed tissue kallikrein inhibition to α1-antitrypsin chimeras. The kavalues were determined under pseudo-first-order conditions using at least a 50-fold molar excess of inhibitors over tissue kallikrein, and the results are summarized in Table II. Wild-type α1-antitrypsin is a slow inhibitor for tissue kallikrein with a low ka of 7.7m−1 s−1(31Geiger R. Stuckstedte U. Clausnitzer B. Fritz H. Hoppe Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). α1-AT/KS, with the P3-P2′ sequence of kallistatin, showed a boosted ka of 8.7 × 102m−1 s−1, which is 100-fold higher than that of wild-type α1-antitrypsin toward tissue kallikrein. By incorporation of the basic residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet, the inhibitory activity of α1-AT/KS/H was further enhanced to 1.8 × 104m−1 s−1, which is approximately 20-fold higher than that of α1-AT/KS and 2300-fold higher than that of wild-type α1-antitrypsin. Theka of α1-AT/KS/H is promoted to a value comparable with that of kallistatin, 1.9 × 104m−1 s−1(29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). These results indicate that the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet in kallistatin accelerates its association with human tissue kallikrein.Table IIComparison of the association rate constants (ka) of kallistatin α1-antitrypsin, and the chimeraska(m−1 s−1)α1-Antitrypsin7.7 2-aAccording to Geiger et al.

Open table in a new tab The ka values were determined according to the method described previously (29Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press.Google Scholar). A positively charged region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin has been identified previously as a heparin-binding site that is responsible for the heparin-suppressive kallikrein inhibition (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that this positively charged loop can facilitate the inhibitory activity toward tissue kallikrein by a direct interaction with tissue kallikrein. This is the first report successfully converting a non-heparin-binding serpin to a heparin-regulated serpin by insertion of a heparin-binding motif. Additionally, we are able to engineer a potent tissue kallikrein inhibitor, whose inhibitory activity increases 2300-fold to a level comparable with that of kallistatin, by transferring the P3-P2′ sequence and a positively charged sequence homologous to the region between the H helix and C2 sheet (homologous heparin-binding sequence) of kallistatin into α1-antitrypsin. We have provided several lines of evidence to show that clusters of positively charged residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet are critical for enhancement of the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward human tissue kallikrein. First, substitution of the basic amino acid residues with alanine in this positively charged loop resulted in a 70–80% reduction of the inhibitory activity of kallistatin toward tissue kallikrein. Second, a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin competed with kallistatin for tissue kallikrein binding. Finally, insertion of a sequence homologous to this positively charged loop of kallistatin into the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of α1-antitrypsin resulted in a >20-fold increase of the association rate with tissue kallikrein. Taken together, our results indicate that the basic residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin act as a secondary binding site to accelerate the association between kallistatin with tissue kallikrein. The reactive center loop of a serpin is a primary determinant for the inhibitory specificity toward serine proteinases. Previous studies have showed that swapping of the reactive site among serpins is insufficient to transfer the complete inhibitory property of one serpin to another, suggesting requirement of other structural elements to fully restore the inhibitory activity (33Djie M.Z. Stone S.R. Le Bonniec B.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16268-16273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Therefore, an efficient association between a serpin and a proteinase may rely on additional interactions to stabilize complex formation other than the reactive sites. Several lines of evidence indicated that interaction between serpins and serine proteinases, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor and plasminogen activator, heparin cofactor II and thrombin, and antithrombin III and urokinase, requires a secondary binding to promote the association (3Le Bonniec B.F.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17199-17205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these previous studies, our results showed that substitution of the reactive center of α1-antitrypsin with that of kallistatin increased the inhibitory activity of α1-antitrypsin toward tissue kallikrein 100-fold but did not completely transfer the inhibitory activity of kallistatin to α1-antitrypsin. The inhibitory activity was further increased >20-fold to a level comparable with that of kallistatin by incorporating clusters of basic residues between the H helix and C2 sheet, indicating a critical role of this positively charged loop in tissue kallikrein inhibition. The notion that this loop may promote the inhibition by acting as a secondary binding element is further supported by the results of a peptide competition assay. The synthetic peptide derived from the sequence between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin competes for tissue kallikrein binding, suggesting a direct interaction of this region with tissue kallikrein. Taken together, incorporation of the reactive center of kallistatin confers the α1-antitrypsin chimera an inhibitory specificity toward tissue kallikrein, whereas the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet appears to be a necessary architecture to boost the inhibitory activity. The loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin is bulged in close vicinity to the reactive center loop in the tertiary structure (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). When the reactive center loop of kallistatin docks into the reactive crevice of tissue kallikrein, the bulged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin would be in an accessible position to interact with tissue kallikrein. Tissue kallikrein is an acidic protein with a pI of 3–4, and it is highly negatively charged under neutral conditions (34Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Phamacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar). In a molecular model of human tissue kallikrein, several acidic amino acid residues were found to be distributed in loops surrounding the reactive crevice that may constitute cation-binding exosites (Fig. 7) (35Katz B.A. Liu B.S. Bames M. Springman E.B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we speculate that the high density of positively charged residues in the loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin may interact with these acidic amino residues in the loop surrounding the reactive crevice of tissue kallikrein. Therefore, the basic residues between the H helix and C2 sheet in a serpin could enhance tissue kallikrein inhibition by two mechanisms. First, these basic residues may direct the reactive center loop of a serpin in a suitable orientation to interact with the reactive crevice of tissue kallikrein by a secondary binding with exosites in the loop around the catalytic center. Second, these basic residues could stabilize the serpin-kallikrein complex formation by electrostatic interactions with cation-binding exosites of tissue kallikrein. The molecular model of the kallistatin-kallikrein complex predicts that Arg308/Lys313 and Lys307/Lys312 may have potential electrostatic interactions with Glu98C[107] and Asp61[69]of tissue kallikrein, respectively (Fig. 8). 2The chymotrypsinogen nomenclature is used to number amino acid residues of human tissue kallikrein (35Katz B.A. Liu B.S. Bames M. Springman E.B. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The residue numbering of human tissue kallikrein is indicated between brackets whenever appropriate. Electrostatic interactions between these acidic residues of kallikrein and kallistatin need to be further investigated to support the hypothesis.Figure 8Potential secondary binding between kallistatin and tissue kallikrein. Potential electrostatic interactions between the basic residues of kallistatin and the acidic residues of tissue kallikrein are shown as green dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The association of kallistatin with tissue kallikrein can be blocked by heparin (18Zhou G.X. Chao L. Chao J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25873-25880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which heparin suppresses the association of kallikrein and kallistatin are not clear. Our study suggests that binding of heparin to the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet may interfere with the secondary binding of kallistatin with tissue kallikrein. In addition, heparin with negatively charged groups may expel the acidic charged amino acids of tissue kallikrein from association with kallistatin. Moreover, binding of heparin to this region may also generate steric hindrance that blocks the docking of kallislatin's reactive loop into tissue kallikrein's reactive center. This notion is supported by molecular modeling of a three-dimensional structure of kallistatin, which shows that the basic residues in this loop are in close vicinity to the reactive center loop (Fig. 1) (19Chen, V. C., Chao, L., and Chao, J. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, in press.Google Scholar). Our previous study showed that kallistatin mutants K307A/R308A and K312A/K313A displayed reduced heparin binding capacity and increased resistance to heparin inhibition upon interaction with tissue kallikrein (26Chen, V. C., Chao, L., Pimenta, D. C., Bledsoe, G., Juliano, L., and Chao, J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem., 276, in press.Google Scholar). In agreement with these results, the α1-antitrypsin chimera α1-AT/KS/H, which contains an insertion of the homologous heparin-binding site of kallistatin, acquires a heparin-suppressed inhibitory activity toward tissue kallikrein. The findings further confirm the conclusion that the region between the H helix and C2 sheet in kallistatin is a major heparin-binding site responsible for heparin-suppressed proteinase inhibition. In addition, the experiments using chimera α1-AT/KS/H demonstrated that the heparin-binding site can be used as a functional unit to convert a non-heparin-binding serpin into a heparin-regulated serpin. The same concept and approach could also be applied on heparin-binding sites in other serpins, such as the D helix in antithrombin, plasminogen activator, and heparin cofactor, to convert a non-heparin-binding serpin to a serpin with heparin-regulated activity similar to the donor. In conclusion, we identified dual roles of the positively charged loop between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin in binding to heparin and in acting as a secondary binding site for tissue kallikrein to accelerate tissue kallikrein inhibition. The success of engineering an α1-antitrypsin chimera with heparin-regulated activity and enhanced inhibitory activity toward tissue kallikrein provides evidence supporting the importance of the basic residues in the region between the H helix and C2 sheet of kallistatin in tissue kallikrein inhibition. Moreover, the studies using chimera demonstrate that the heparin-binding site or the secondary binding site of kallistatin can be used as a functional module to design inhibitors for tissue kallikrein. These findings provide useful insights for future development of inhibitors for serine proteinases."

The binding sites for Ca2+ on the Ca2+-ATPase have been located in the transmembrane region of the protein, involving several residues from different segments, such as M4, M5, M6, and M8 (7Clarke D.M.

The ATP-binding site has been probed with different reagents, one of the best characterized being FITC, which reacts with Lys515to inhibit ATP binding with high specificity (12Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 13Mitchinson C. Wilderspin A.F. Trinnaman B.J. Green N.M.

Biochemistry. 1987; 27: 5885-5890Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Other chemical modifications in residues close to Lys515 also modify ATP binding, e.g.Lys492 with glutaraldehyde, pyridoxal derivatives, and azo derivatives of ATP, which also bind to Thr532 and Thr533 (15McIntosh D.B.

Single mutations of amino acids of that peptide region do not completely inhibit ATP binding probably because the ATP-binding site is defined by several residues from different segments of the primary structure of the protein (18Taylor W.R. Green N.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 179: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). There are 24 cysteine residues in the Ca2+-ATPase that are susceptible to react with sulfhydryl reagents. Some of them are protected by ATP, suggesting that they might be involved in the ATP-binding site (19Mahaney J.E. Froelich J.P. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4864-4879Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Wawrzynów A. Collins J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The most common reagents used for cysteine residues are iodoacetamides, maleimides, and NBD-Cl. The first reacts with Cys670 and Cys674 and does not alter ATPase activity (21Squier T.C. Bigelow D.J. Garcia de Ancos J. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4748-4754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the maleimides used on the Ca2+-ATPase, NEM has the smallest chemical structure. Under certain experimental conditions it can react with Cys344and Cys364 or with Cys377 and Cys614 (22Saito-Nakatsuka K. Yamashita T. Kubota I. Kawakita M. J. Biochem.

Biochem. 1993; 217: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Fluoresceine maleimide has been reported to bind to Cys471 and Cys364, and 4-dimethylamino-phenylazophenyl-4′-maleimide to Cys364(20Wawrzynów A. Collins J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1203: 60-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Phenylmaleimide has been shown to inhibit Ca2+-ATPase activity with high specificity by inhibiting the phosphorylation reaction (27Velasco-Guillén Gómez-Fernández J.C. Teruel J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). In this work a fluorescent maleimide of a similar size to phenylmaleimide, maleimidylsalicylic acid, has been used on the Ca2+-ATPase. It is shown that the inhibition behavior of this maleimide is different from other known maleimides because it binds near the phosphorylation site, Asp351, inhibiting ATP binding but not the incorporation of phosphate, thus altering the relationship between the nucleotide-binding site and the phosphorylation site. Maleimidylsalicylic acid was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Pyruvate kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, phosphoenolpyruvate, ATP, AMP-PNP and NADH were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The radiochemicals [γ-32P]ATP, [32P]Pi, and [3H]glucose were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Angiotensin I and cytochrome c were from Sigma. Calcium ionophore, A23187, was obtained from Calbiochem (Madrid, Spain). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. The sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles were prepared from rabbit hind leg muscle, as described previously by Eletr and Inesi (28Eletr S. Inesi G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 282: 174-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and stored in frozen aliquots until use. The fluorescence measurements were performed in a Shimadzu RF-540 fluorescence spectrometer. The excitation and emission spectra were obtained in 100 mmMOPS/TEA, pH 8.0, and 50 mml-cysteine. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 307 and 435 nm, respectively. The MSA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, and its concentration was measured at 307 nm in a methanolic solution containing 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% sodium acetate. In these conditions the molar absorption coefficient is 3.4 × 103m−1 cm−1. The protein concentration was determined according to the procedure of Lowry et al. (29Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. 1 mg/ml SR was incubated at room temperature in darkness with 100 mm MOPS/TEA, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EGTA, and different MSA concentrations for different periods of time. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 mml-cysteine. ATPase activity was measured by a coupled enzyme system (30Gómez-Fernández J.C. Goñi F.M. Bach D. Restall C.J. Chapman D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 598: 502-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The reaction medium contained 20 mmMOPS, pH 6.8, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmCaCl2, 3 μm ionophore A23187, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm phosphoenol pyruvate, 0.24 mm NADH, 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase. The SR concentration used was 0.02 mg/ml. The absorbance was recorded at 340 nm to measure the decrease in NADH concentration. ATP hydrolysis activity was calculated using a ε340(NADH) = 6220 m−1 cm−1. The inorganic phosphate was purified before use (31Kanazawa T. Boyer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3163-3172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles was achieved as described previously by Inesiet al. (1Inesi G. Sumbilla C. Kirtley M.E. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, the protein was incubated for 5 min in a medium containing 20 mm MES, pH 6.0, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and different [32P]Pi concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mm. The protein concentration used was 0.5 mg/ml. The phosphorylation reaction was quenched by addition of 2 ml of 0.25m perchloric acid and 4 mm Pi. The quenched samples were cooled on ice, washed, and centrifuged repeatedly. The final pellets were dissolved in 0.25 ml of 0.1n NaOH, 2% Na2CO3, 2% SDS, and 5 mm NaH2PO4 prior to determination of radioactivity and protein concentration. The reaction medium contained 40 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 160 mm KCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 5 μmA23187. The protein concentration used was 0.06 mg/ml. Protein phosphorylation was carried out at room temperature and started by addition of 0.4 mm[γ-32P]ATP for 10 s. The reaction was stopped by adding 4 volumes of an ice-cold solution of 0.8 mperchloric acid and 40 mm Pi. The quenched samples were filtered through 0.65-μm pore size Millipore filters. The filters were then washed five times with 5 ml of 0.125m perchloric acid and 20 mm Pi, and the radioactivity was counted. The ATP binding assay was carried out in the absence of calcium to prevent ATP splitting. ATP binding to unmodified and modified SR with 75 μm MSA was measured by a double labeling radioactive technique using a filtration method (32Champeil P. Guillain F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 7623-7633Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 33Orlowski S. Champeil P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 352-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Briefly, a Millipore DAWP 0.65-μm filter was loaded with 0.4 mg of protein incubated at room temperature. Then, 4 ml of a solution of 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 80 mm KCl, 1 mmEGTA and 5 mm MgCl2 were layered onto filters under vacuum and rinsed with 1 ml of the above solution containing 1 mm [γ-32P]ATP and 1 mm[3H]glucose. The ATP bound to the protein was estimated from radioactive counting of the filters after correction for nonspecific nucleotide adsorption (3H labeling). SR vesicles were labeled with FITC (12Pick U. Karlish S.J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 626: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) as follows: the SR vesicles (2 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in a medium containing 0.2 m sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.2, 25 mm glycine, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 30 μm FITC for 10 min at 25 °C in darkness. The labeling reaction was stopped by transferring the sample through a Sephadex G-50 column pre-equilibrated with ice-cold stopping solution containing 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 80 mm KCl, and 5 mm MgCl2. The filtered vesicles were then centrifuged at 105,000 × gfor 45 min at 5 °C. The pellet was resuspended with 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, and 30% sucrose, and the protein concentration was measured. SR was labeled with NEM after the procedure of Kawakita and Yamashita (34Kawakita M. Yamashita Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 102: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 3 mg/ml of SR was incubated for 50 min in a medium containing 40 mmMOPS, pH 6.8, 0.1 m KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 μm CaCl2, and 0.4 mm NEM, at 30 °C. The labeling reaction was stopped by 3-fold dilution with an ice-cold solution of 150 mmMOPS/TEA, pH 8.0, and 0.15 mm EGTA before labeling with MSA. MSA-labeled SR (1 mg/ml) resuspended in 0.25 sucrose, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.1, was digested with trypsin by incubation with 0.25 mg/ml trypsin for 5 min at 37 °C. The proteolysis reaction was quenched by addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. The insoluble material was separated by centrifugation at 105,000 × g for 45 min at 5 °C, and the supernatant was collected for reverse phase HPLC and mass spectrometry. Aliquots of 100 μl of the soluble fraction obtained after trypsin digestion were subjected to HPLC on a Beckman HPLC system (controller 421A model) in a reverse phase column (Spherisorb ODS, 25 × 0.46 cm). For separation, a linear gradient was developed at 1 ml/min over 40 min from 10% solvent A (0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile) to 45% solvent B (0.01% trifluoroacetic acid in water), returning to the initial conditions (10% solvent A) for an additional 60 min. Peptides were detected with a UV detector at 225 nm and with a fluorescence detector at 330-nm excitation wavelength and 435-nm emission wavelength. A saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in aqueous 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was used as the matrix. The sample was dissolved in aqueous 30% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 1 μl of matrix and 1 μl of sample were mixed on the sample holder (a stainless steel plate) and air dried before being inserted into the mass spectrometer. The mass spectra were recorded with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (VG TodSpec, Fisons Instruments). Spectra were calibrated externally with a two-point calibration using the [M+H+] and [M+2H+] ions from the protein standards angiotensin I (1297.3 Da) or cytochrome c (12327 Da). The analysis was performed in the positive and linear mode with an accelerating voltage of 22500 V. The spectra were obtained by averaging 20–30 laser shots. Maleimidylsalicylic acid is soluble in water at neutral pH and has low fluorescence until reacted with cysteine residues in proteins, a characteristic that makes it potentially useful for thiol quantification and characterization. SR was preincubated with MSA in 100 mm MOPS/TEA at pH 8.0. Aliquots were withdrawn at different times to assay the residual ATP hydrolysis activity. When the MSA concentration in the preincubation medium was 75 μm, the ATPase inhibition occurred in a time scale of minutes, 75% inhibition being reached after 15 min of reaction (Fig. 1). Longer incubation times or higher MSA concentrations led to a nonspecific effect of MSA on the enzyme. Therefore, these conditions (75 μm MSA and 15 min of incubation time) were selected for most of the following inhibition experiments. To study the kinetics of MSA inhibition, the same experiment was performed at different MSA concentrations, and the results were plotted on a logarithmic scale, as shown in Fig. 2 A. All curves could be fitted to single exponential equations, from which an apparent first-order rate constant was obtained (kapp). This constant was subsequently plotted versus MSA concentration (Fig. 2 B). A linear relationship was observed between thekapp and MSA concentration, suggesting a pseudo-first-order kinetic in the covalent reaction between the MSA and the cysteine residues of the ATPase. The corresponding kinetic rate constant, as calculated from the slope of the curve from Fig. 2 B, was 8.3 m−1s−1.Figure 1Inhibition of the ATP hydrolysis activity. SR was labeled with 75 μm MSA, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Aliquots of 0.02 mg of protein were withdrawn at different times to measure the residual ATP hydrolysis activity in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, 80 mm KCl., 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.1 mm ATP, 1 mm PEP, 0.24 mm NADH, 2 μmA23187, 5 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase at room temperature.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Kinetics of ATPase inhibition by MSA.A, SR was labeled with the following MSA concentrations: 25 μm (●); 50 μm (○); 75 μm(▪); 100 μm (■); 150 μm (▴); 200 μm (▵); 250 μm (▾); 300 μm (▿); and 400 μm (♦).

The first-order inhibition rate constant (ki) is calculated from the slope.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The residual activity of partially inhibited ATPase was assayed at different calcium concentrations. In the experiment of Fig. 3, the ATPase was inhibited with 75 μm MSA for 15 min. No difference was seen between the native and inhibited ATPase, and the calcium dependent activity was not modified by MSA. The presence of calcium in the inhibition medium did not alter the inhibition pattern (not shown), indicating that calcium binding does not affect the reactive cysteine residues. The presence of different nucleotides in the inhibition medium appeared to strongly block the inhibition reaction (Fig. 4). The nucleotides used were ATP, AMP-PNP, ADP, and AMP at a fixed concentration of 1 mm. All of them were capable of slowing down the inhibition reaction, with AMP being the least effective. However, ADP, AMP-PNP, and ATP completely abolished the inhibition in the experimental conditions used. The different effect of these nucleotides is not surprising because their affinities for ATPase are also different, the apparent dissociation constant of ATP, AMP-PNP, and ADP being in the micromolar range and in the millimolar range in the case of AMP (35Moutin M. Cuillel M. Rapin C. Miras R. Anger M. Lompré A. Dupont Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11147-11154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, AMP is not at a saturating concentration unlike the rest of the nucleotides used, which explains the lower protection it affords. These results indicate that binding of the adenosine moiety of the nucleotide is the main feature in blocking MSA inhibition, and the ionic moieties of the β and γ phosphates are not involved in the obstruction of MSA interaction. Binding of ATP was determined by incubating SR with [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of calcium and including [3H]glucose in the medium. Aliquots of 0.4 mg of protein were filtered, and the radioactivity retained in the filters was counted. Bound ATP was calculated by subtracting the free [γ-32P]ATP concentration contained on the filters, calculated from the radioactivity corresponding to [3H]glucose, from total [γ-32P]ATP. In Fig. 5 it can be seen that ATP binding was strongly and progressively reduced when the ATPase was previously modified by MSA at increasing time periods. Once it was determined that nucleotide binding affects the inhibition reaction and vice versa and that the MSA reaction interferes with ATP binding, other intermediates of the catalytic cycle, which might be involved in the inhibition of ATPase activity by MSA, were studied. In the experiment shown in Fig. 5for EP, an aliquot was withdrawn from the inhibition reaction at different times and added to a medium containing 0.4 mm[γ-32P]ATP and calcium to measure the phosphoenzyme level reached in steady-state conditions. It is clear from Fig. 5 that ATP phosphorylation was inhibited during the MSA reaction. This was not unexpected because the ATP phosphorylation reaction depends on previous partial reactions, such as ATP binding. Therefore the inhibition of EP formation appears as a result of the ATP binding inhibition. However, a comparison of ATP binding and EP levels in Fig. 5 shows that ATP inhibition takes place faster than enzyme phosphorylation. Enzyme phosphorylation with inorganic phosphate was performed in equilibrium conditions using [32P]Pi as phosphate donor at pH 6.0. No appreciable difference was observed in Pi phosphorylation up to 10 mm Piconcentration in SR modified with 75 μm MSA (Fig. 6 A), and only a slight decrease was seen at very high MSA concentrations (Fig. 6 B). This might reflect the reaction of MSA with other less specific residues when higher MSA concentrations are used. Free MSA has a very low fluorescence, which is only enhanced when it reacts with thiols. MSA forms a fluorescent adduct with cysteine residues of SR with an excitation wavelength at 307 nm and an emission wavelength at 435 nm. This property was exploited to study the binding of MSA to SR in different conditions. Thus, the binding of MSA was assayed by measuring the increase in its fluorescence during its reaction with SR. For quantification purposes, a standard curve with MSA reacted with an excess ofl-cysteine was used. The binding of MSA was studied in native SR in the absence and in the presence of AMP-PNP to prevent ATPase inhibition. Nucleotide-sensitive MSA binding was taken as the difference between both curves. MSA binding was also studied in SR previously modified with FITC and with NEM, the former to irreversibly prevent nucleotide binding and the latter to specifically block cysteine residues. These experiments are depicted in Fig. 7, where the MSA fluorescence units are converted to bound MSA. In the presence of AMP-PNP, MSA binding was not completely inhibited in our experimental conditions. Despite this, in these conditions the inhibition of the ATPase activity was fully protected (Fig. 4). This may be the result of nonspecific binding to the ATPase, which would not affect the ATP hydrolysis activity of the enzyme. The stoichiometry of MSA binding was 6–10 nmol MSA/mg of protein, which corresponds to the reaction of up to one cysteine residue per ATPase molecule. FITC-modified SR cannot bind ATP, and, as can be seen in Fig. 7, the MSA binding capacity is reduced by more than 50%, confirming the involvement of the nucleotide-binding site. NEM is a much smaller maleimide than MSA because it lacks the aromatic ring provided by the salicylic group, thus minimizing any steric effects it may have. Furthermore, NEM labeling was performed in conditions in which NEM reacts with Cys344 and Cys364 (22Saito-Nakatsuka K. Yamashita T. Kubota I. Kawakita M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1987; 101: 365-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this case MSA binding was fully inhibited (Fig. 7 A). MSA binding performed on ATPase prelabeled with different NEM concentrations is shown in Fig. 7 B, the result clearly indicating the involvement of some of these cysteine residues in the reaction with MSA. To isolate a small peptide fragment containing the MSA label responsible for the inhibition of the ATPase activity, the SR was labeled in the presence and in the absence of AMP-PNP to differentiate between specific and nonspecific MSA binding. Labeling was performed with 75 μm MSA for 15 min. The labeled SR was subjected to extensive tryptic digestion with a trypsin/ATPase ratio of 0.25 (w/w) for 5 min at 37 °C. The digestion was stopped by addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid, which precipitates the membrane fraction, maintaining the soluble peptides in the supernatant. Both fractions then separated by ultracentrifugation at 105,000 × gfor 45 min. The pellet was resuspended in 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.8, and 80 mm KCl and the MSA fluorescence was measured in the pellet and in the supernatant. Only the soluble fraction was fluorescent, and this was subsequently subjected to reverse phase HPLC using a C18 column. Fig. 8 A shows the chromatogram of SR labeled in the absence of AMP-PNP, in which different fluorescent peaks can be observed. However, when MSA-SR was obtained in the presence of AMP-PNP to inhibit specific MSA binding, the same peaks were obtained except the one appearing at 23 min (Fig. 8 B). It seems then, that this peptide might be specific for ATPase inhibition because it did not appear when MSA labeling was performed in the presence of AMP-PNP. Consequently, the fraction retained at 23 min was eluted and lyophilized for peptide sequencing and mass spectrometry. The lyophilized peptide was submitted to six cycles of peptide sequencing from the N-terminal residue, resulting in one major sequence starting by GFNPPD and another in the background starting by SLPSVE. Both peptides can be matched to the ATPase sequence, the first one corresponding to Gly808 and the second to Ser335. To ascertain the length of the peptide, the molecular mass was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The sample (lyophilized eluted fraction) was dissolved in acetonitrile/water (30%) containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in the same solvent as the sample. Fig. 9 shows a representative spectrogram. Two peaks are observed with mass to charge ratios of 1738 and 2069 Da. When the possibility that each peak might correspond to one of each sequenced peptide was checked, it resulted that the sequence 808GFNPPDLDIMDRPPR822 had a molecular mass of 1740 Da, and the sequence335SLPSVETLGCTSVICSDK352 had a molecular mass of 1839 Da. If this last peptide had one MSA molecule attached to one of its cysteine residues, its mass would increase to 2072 Da. Thus, both sequences correlate quite well with the mass observed in the spectrogram (Fig. 9), although other possibilities were also taken into account. For example, it was considered that both peaks might correspond to only one peptide with different degree of degradation and/or with different bound MSA molecules. However, these possibilities were discounted The possibility of a differentm/z ratio was also excluded because masses of [M+2H+] were not detected. None of the possibilities analyzed fitted as well as the one proposed above. Therefore, it was concluded that the fluorescent peak eluted from the HPLC column is composed of two major peptides, with only one being fluorescent, because the peptide Gly808–Arg822 has no cysteine residues in the sequence. The present work shows that labeling with MSA is accompanied by strong inhibition of the Ca2+-ATPase, and that an exclusive prevention of MSA binding protects against of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibition. This protection may be achieved by occupancy of the nucleotide-binding site. Conversely, MSA labeling inhibits ATP binding and consequently EP formation by ATP, resulting in the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis activity. We chose maleimidylsalicylic acid to inhibit the Ca2+-ATPase because it is similar in size to phenylmaleimide, which we studied previously (27Velasco-Guillén Gómez-Fernández J.C. Teruel J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 372: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, MSA has polar substituents in the phenyl ring provided by a carboxylic anion and a hydroxyl group, which presumably cause differences in the intera"
