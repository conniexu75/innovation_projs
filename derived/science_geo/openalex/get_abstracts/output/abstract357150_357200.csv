Autophagy removes intracellular pathogens and participates in antigen presentation. Here, we demonstrate that not only TLR4, but also other TLR family members induce autophagy in macrophages, which is inhibited by MyD88, Trif, or Beclin 1 shRNA expression. MyD88 and Trif co-immunoprecipitate with Beclin 1, a key factor in autophagosome formation. TLR signaling enhances the interaction of MyD88 and Trif with Beclin 1, and reduces the binding of Beclin 1 to Bcl-2. These findings indicate TLR signaling via its adaptor proteins reduces the binding of Beclin 1 to Bcl-2 by recruiting Beclin 1 into the TLR-signaling complex leading to autophagy.

One of the mechanisms by which the innate immune system senses the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms is through Toll-like receptors (TLRs), 3The abbreviations used are: TLR, Toll-like receptor; MAL, MyD88-adapter like; TRIF, TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon β; TRAM, TRIF-related adaptor molecule; SARM, and sterile α- and armadillo motif-containing protein; GFP, green fluorescent protein; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; TIR, Toll/interleukin receptor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; ssRNA, single strand RNA. which recognize specific molecular patterns that are present in microbial components. Stimulation of different TLRs induces distinct patterns of gene expression, which not only leads to the activation of innate immunity, but also instructs the development of antigen-specific acquired immunity (1Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar, 2Trinchieri G. Sher A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 179-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). TLR signaling predominantly induces interferon regulatory factors, and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and AP1 activation. This elicits the production of type I interferon and inflammatory cytokines (3Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6751) Google Scholar, 4Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). TLR signaling also facilitates the selection of microbial antigens for presentation by dendritic cells (5Blander J.M. Medzhitov R. Nature. 2006; 440: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Parasitic protozoans can also trigger TLRs enhancing resistance to them by triggering pro-inflammatory responses (6Gazzinelli R.T. Denkers E.Y. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 895-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Ten members of the TLR family have been identified in human, and 13 in mice (4Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Signaling by TLRs involves five adaptor proteins known as MyD88, MyD88-adapter like (MAL), Toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein inducing interferon β (TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), and sterile α- and armadillo motifcontaining protein (SARM). MAL recruits MyD88 to TLR2 and TLR4, and TRAM recruits TRIF to TLR4 to allow interferon regulator factor 3 activation. SARM negatively regulates TRIF. MyD88 is the key signaling adaptor for all TLRs with the exception of TLR3 and a subset of TLR4 signals, which utilize Trif (7O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a cellular response to starvation as well as a quality control system that can remove damaged organelles and long-lived proteins from cytoplasm. Autophagy plays a role in programmed cell death, the promotion and prevention of cancer, neurodegeneration, and cellular defense to remove invading pathogens (8Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2196) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been recognized that autophagy is involved in both innate and adaptive immunity against intracellular protozoa, bacteria, and viruses (9Deretic V. Trends Immunol. 2005; 26: 523-528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 10Schmid D. Munz C. Immunity. 2007; 27: 11-21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 11Levine B. Deretic V. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 767-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Autophagy has been implicated in major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation. During autophagy cytoplasmic materials are sequestered into double membrane-coated autophagosomes, which fuse with endosomes and lysosomes to form autolysosomes where the contents are degraded by lysosomal enzymes. Autophagy is a constitutively active pathway in all major histocompatibility complex class II positive cells, where the autophagosomes continuously fuse with the multivesicular major histocompatibility complex class II-loading compartment. This provides a potential mechanism for class II positive cells to continuously present cytosolic contents to CD4+ T cells (12Schmid D. Pypaert M. Munz C. Immunity. 2007; 26: 79-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Beclin 1, the mammalian homologue of yeast Atg6, is a key component of a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex that initiates autophagosome formation helping to localize other autophagy proteins to the pre-autophagosomal membrane (13Kihara A. Kabeya Y. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 330-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Bcl2 is an anti-apoptotic protein, which binds Beclin 1, and is known to inhibit autophagy (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). In this study, we use macrophages to test the potential of a panel of TLR ligands to trigger autophagy. We find that MyD88 and Trif interact with Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 and that TLR signaling alters the balance, which is likely critical in triggering autophagy. Cell Culture and GPF-LC3 Stably Transduced Cell Line—RAW 264.7 cells were obtain from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. The LC3 cDNA was a gift from Dr. Noboru Mizushima (Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan). RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with the GFP-LC3 construct, using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The transfection protocol from the manufacturer was followed. 24 h after transfection 400 μg/ml G418 (Mediatech, Herdon, VA) was added to select positive cells for 3 weeks; after which the positive cells were enriched by cell sorting and maintained. Plasmids—Full-length Flag-MyD88, and its C-terminal and N-terminal truncation constructs were kindly provided by Dr. A. Ding (Cornell University). The dominant-negative Trif construct was a gift from Dr. S. Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The Trif expression vector was a gift from Dr. Douglas Golenbock (University of Massachusetts Medical School). The Beclin 1 construct was kindly provided by Dr. B. Levine (Baylor College of Medicine). shRNAs—The shRNA constructs targeting MyD88 and Trif were gifts from Dr. J. H. Shelhamer (Critical Care Medicine Department, Clinical Center, NIH, Bethesda, MD) (15Qi H.Y. Shelhamer J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38969-38975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The shRNA sequences of two different targeted sites in mouse Beclin 1 were TGGACACGAGCTTCAAGAT and TGGAGATCCTAGAGCAGAT. The annealed inserts were cloned into the RNAi-Ready pSIREN-RetroQ vector (Clontech) that had been previously digested with EcoRI-BamHI. The negative control shRNA was purchased from Clontech. The shRNAs for silencing MyD88, Trif, Beclin 1, or a negative control were transfected into RAW 267.4 cells twice separated by 24 h using FuGENE HD Transfection Reagent (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). The cells were treated with LPS or poly(I·C) for 7 or 16 h. Electron Microscopy—RAW 264.7 cells without treatment served as the control. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or poly(I·C), 20 μg/ml (Apotech, Epalinges, Switzerland), for 14 h. The cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. Fixed monolayers were scraped, rinsed in buffer three times, and postfixed in 1% osmium tetroxide plus 0.8% potassium ferricyanide in the above buffer for 1 h. After several rinses in the buffer, the cells were dehydrated with increasing concentrations of ethanol and gradually infiltrated with Epon-Aradite (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Samples were polymerized at 60 °C for 1 day. Ultrathin sections (about 80 nm) were cut on Leica EM UC6 microtome (Bannockburn, IL) and collected on copper slot grids. Sections were counterstained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined using a FEI CM120 transmission electron microscope equipped with a Gatan GIF100 image filter operating at beam energy of 120 keV. Images were acquired by using a Gatan 1k × 1k cooled CCD camera. Autophagy Assay—A PerkinElmer Ultraview spinning wheel confocal system mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope and equipped with an argon/krypton laser, an Orca-ERII CCD camera (Hamamatsu), and filters suitable for visualization of both fluorescein isothiocyanate and red dyes was used for the quantization of cells transfected with GFP-LC3. A minimum of 50–100 cells per sample were counted. Compared with the control, GFP-LC3 dots in autophagy cells were much more numerous and larger. All ligands except ssRNA40 used for stimulating TLRs to induce autophagosome formation were purchased from Apotech (Epalinges, Switzerland). The ligand ssRNA40 for TLR7 was purchased from Invivogen (San Diego, CA). Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation Assays—The antibodies that were purchased for Western blot and co-immunoprecipitation were MyD88 and Actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), Trif (Imgenex, San Diego, CA), Beclin 1 and IκB-α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), and LC3 (MBL, Woburn, MA). RAW 264.7 cells were lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% SDS, and 10% glycerol with a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were centrifuged, and equivalent amounts of protein were loaded onto 4–20 or 10% Tris glycine/SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen). After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The specific antibodies as indicated were used for immunoblots. For co-immunoprecipitation assays, a modified lysis buffer was used. Instead of 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2% SDS, 0.5% Triton and 0.5% CHAPS were used. The lysates were incubated with antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, and then Protein G PLUS-agarose was added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated beads were washed with 0.5 ml of the same buffer 8 times. The immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and MyD88, Trif, and Beclin 1 detected by immunoblot analysis as described above. TLRs Induce Autophagy in Murine Macrophages—To detect autophagosome formation, green fluorescent protein fused to LC3 (GFP-LC3) was used as a surrogate marker. LC3 is a mammalian homologue of yeast Atg8, which is a specific constituent of the yeast autophagosomal membrane. LC3 exists in two forms, an 18-kDa cytosolic form (LC3-I) and a 16-kDa processed form (LC3-II), which localizes on the autophagosome membrane, where it functions in autophagosome enlargement (16Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). To determine whether TLRs induce autophagy in RAW 264.7 macrophages, we used a stably transfected cell line that expresses GFP-LC3. When autophagosomes form, GFP-LC3 is processed and recruited to the autophagosome membrane, where it can be imaged by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1A). The percentages of GFP-LC3 positive cells that have GFP-LC3 dots can be counted and are indicative of autophagosome formation. We treated the RAW 264.7/GFP-LC3 cells with different TLR ligands for 7 h and found that signaling through TLR1, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR7 induced significant increases in autophagosome formation. Ligands for TLR4, TLR7, TLR1, TLR3, TLR5, and TLR6 induced autophagy in 55, 42, 37, 32, 24, and 21% of the cells, respectively. Interestingly, signaling through TLR1 or TLR3 induced similar responses, despite their use of different adaptor proteins, MydD88 for TLR1 and Trif for TLR3. Ligands for TLR9 triggered autophagosome formation in 9% of the cells, only slightly above the basal level of 4% (Fig. 1B). To provide further evidence of TLR-induced autophagosome formation, we examined endogenous LC3-I and LC3-II levels by immunoblotting using either TLR4 or TLR3 ligands to treat the cells. Although the LC3-I band predominated in the untreated macrophages we could detect some LC3-II even in the absence of TLR ligand exposure. However, treatment with TLR3 or TLR4 ligands decreased the LC3-I band and increased the LC3-II band consistent with our previous assay (Fig. 1C). We also confirmed the TLR-induced autophagy at the ultrastructural level by electron microscopy. Both TLR3 and TLR4 signaling led to the appearance of autophagic vacuoles, double-membrane vacuolar structures containing cytoplasmic contents. Non-treated cells showed a few small autophagic vacuoles, some of which contained mitochondrial membranes. After TLR4 activation, we visualized large autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasm of the RAW 264.7 cells, in which organelles did not exist. Activation of TLR3 with poly(I·C) induced some large autophagic vacuoles as well as some smaller vacuoles (Fig. 1D). Together these data indicate that TLR signaling leads to autophagosome formation. MyD88, Trif, and Beclin 1 Are Involved in Triggering Autophagy in RAW 264.7 Cells—TLR4 links to both MyD88 and Trif, TLR3 exclusively uses Trif, and the other TLRs use MyD88 as their major adaptor to transduce signals to downstream effectors (4Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Beclin 1 interacts with the class III phosphoinositide-3-kinase (Vps34) to localize other autophagy proteins to the preautophagosomal membrane (17Xie Z. Klionsky D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 1102-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar). Bcl-2 binds Beclin 1 and functions as a brake to autophagy and autophagic cell death perhaps by affecting the interaction between Beclin 1 and Vps34 (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar). As an initial test of MyD88 or Trif involvement in the mediation of autophagosome formation, we expressed either MyD88 or Trif with GFP-LC3 in RAW 264.7 cells. We found that MyD88 or Trif expression led to GFP-LC3 dots in 60–70% of the GFP-LC3 positive cells, nearly similar to that achieved by the overexpression of Beclin 1. We also expressed the TIR-domain containing adapters SARM and TRAM along with GFP-LC3 in RAW 264.7. As expected, SARM, which is a negative regulator of TLR signaling (18Carty M. Goodbody R. Schroder M. Stack J. Moynagh P.N. Bowie A.G. Nat. Immunol. 2006; 7: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), did not induce autophagy; however, expression of TRAM, which acts as a bridging adaptor for Trif-induced signaling (7O'Neill L.A. Bowie A.G. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 353-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (2035) Google Scholar), led to a moderate induction of autophagy (Fig. 2A). Together these data suggest that TLR signaling through MyD88 and/or Trif leads to autophagosome formation. MyD88 has a death domain at its NH2-terminal, which links it to downstream effectors in the TLR signaling pathways and a TIR domain at its COOH-terminal, which interacts with the cytoplasmic portion of various TLRs. An N-terminal truncated MyD88 functions as a dominant negative (19Medzhitov R. Preston-Hurlburt P. Kopp E. Stadlen A. Chen C. Ghosh S. Janeway Jr., C.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 253-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The TIR domain of Trif has similar behavior (20Yamamoto M. Sato S. Mori K. Hoshino K. Takeuchi O. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6668-6672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). We used the dominant negative constructs or expressed shRNAs that target MyD88, Trif, or Beclin 1 to verify the roles of MyD88 and Trif in TLR4 and TLR3 induced autophagy. RAW 264.7 cells were transfected with the various constructs and GFP-LC3, treated 24 h later with either LPS or poly(I·C), and 7 h later autophagosome formation were measured by counting the percentage of GFP-LC3 positive cells that contained GFP-LC3 dots. Expression of the MyD88 or the Trif dominant negative form reduced LPS-induced autophagosome formation by 58 and 33%, respectively, whereas shRNAs targeting MyD88 or Trif reduced LPS-induced autophagosome formation by 67 and 50%, respectively. Two Beclin 1 shRNAs targeted at distinct sites in the Beclin 1 mRNA reduced autophagosome formation by 55 and 41% (Fig. 2B). Next, we examined whether Trif and Beclin 1 are required for poly(I·C)-activated TLR3-induced autophagosome formation. Using a similar experimental protocol, the expression of the Trif dominant negative form reduced TLR3-induced autophagosome formation by 55%, whereas the Trif shRNA reduced it 62%. The Beclin 1 shRNAs had similar effects as observed with TLR4-induced autophagosome formation (Fig. 2C). We also examined endogenous LC3-I and LC3-II levels following TLR3 or TLR4 signaling by immunoblotting cell lysates prepared from RAW 264.7 cells previously transfected with the Trif, MyD88, or Beclin 1 shRNAs. Consistent with the data using the RAW 264.7 cells transfected with GFP-LC3, reducing Trif, MyD88, or Beclin 1 impaired TLR4- or TLR3-induced increases in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio (Fig. 2, D and E). The efficacy of the shRNAs in reducing MyD88, Trif, and Beclin 1 is shown (Fig. 2F). Activated TLR4 Recruits Beclin 1, MyD88, and Trif—In an attempt to link TLR signaling to autophagy, we examined whether activated TLR4 signaling recruited Beclin 1 into the TLR4 signaling complex. To do so we treated RAW 264.7 cells with an agonistic TLR4 antibody or a control antibody for 15 min, 1, and 4 h prior to cell lysis. In addition we added the same antibodies to non-treated cell lysates, which served as a time 0 point. We immunoprecipitated the TLR4 antibody or control antibody and immunoblotted for associated proteins (Fig. 3A). Beclin 1 co-immunoprecipitated with the TLR4 antibody, but not the control. The TLR4-Beclin 1 interaction increased with time and the Beclin 1 bands shifted upward suggesting a modification of Beclin 1. As expected, TLR4 adaptors MyD88 and Trif immunoprecipitated with TLR4. With the duration of exposure of the agonistic antibody, we detected more MyD88 and an altered mobility of Trif. The TLR4 antibody signaling also led to the recruitment of the protein kinase Irak4, a known member of the TLR4 signaling complex (4Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting the cell lysates for Beclin 1 and IκBα expression revealed no change in Beclin 1 expression and degradation of IκBα indicating NF-κB activation. (Fig. 3A). To determine the relative importance of the MyD88 death and TIR domains in recruiting Beclin-1, we expressed tagged versions of full-length, TIR domaintruncated, and death domain-truncated MyD88 and examined their interaction with endogenous Beclin 1. The death domain of MyD88 pulled down Beclin 1, whereas the death domain deleted version did not (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, expression of the death domain of MyD88 induced autophagy nearly as well as full-length MyD88, whereas the death domain deleted version did not (data not shown). We also showed that Trif immunoprecipitates prepared from Trif-transfected cells contained endogenous Beclin 1 (Fig. 3C). These data strongly suggest that ligand-activated TLR4 assembles signaling complexes that contained MyD88, Trif, Irak4, and Beclin 1. MyD88 and Trif Modulate the Interaction between Bcl2 and Beclin 1—The anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 inhibits starvation-induced autophagy via targeting the BH3-like domain in Beclin 1 (14Pattingre S. Tassa A. Qu X. Garuti R. Liang X.H. Mizushima N. Packer M. Schneider M.D. Levine B. Cell. 2005; 122: 927-939Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2978) Google Scholar, 21Maiuri M.C. Le Toumelin G. Criollo A. Rain J.C. Gautier F. Juin P. Tasdemir E. Pierron G. Troulinaki K. Tavernarakis N. Hickman J.A. Geneste O. Kroemer G. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Upon finding that TLR signaling leads to autophagy we sought to determine whether Bcl-2 had a role in modulating TLR-induced autophagy. However, first we verified that exposure to TLR3 and TLR4 ligands would enhance the interaction between Beclin 1 and MyD88 or Trif. The results indicated that exposure to the TLR4 ligand LPS triggered both MyD88 and Trif to recruit Beclin 1, whereas exposure to the TLR3 ligand poly(I·C) led to an increased association between Trif and Beclin 1 (Fig. 4A). Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates from lysates prepared from the same experiment were examined for the presence of MyD88, Trif, of Beclin 1. We found both MyD88 and Trif in the Bcl-2 immunoprecipitates, the levels of which increased slightly following signaling. In addition, a striking decrease in the Bcl-2 and Beclin 1 interaction occurred (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, when we immunoprecipitated MyD88 following exposure of RAW 267.4 cells to LPS we noted a large increase in co-immunoprecipitated Beclin 1 (Fig. 4C). Recently, induction of autophagy via TLR7 has been shown to depend on MyD88 and Beclin 1 expression (22Delgado M.A. Elmaoued R.A. Davis A.S. Kyei G. Deretic V. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). We found that similar to activated TLR4, activated TLR7 also enhanced association between MyD88 and Beclin 1, and deceased Bcl-2 binding with Beclin 1 (Fig. 4D). Next, we asked whether MyD88 or Bcl2 overexpression affected the interaction between Bcl2 and Beclin 1, or the association of Beclin 1 with MyD88 and Trif. Empty vector, MyD88, the MyD88 death domain (NT), or the death domain deleted version (CT) were transfected into RAW 264.7 cells. The expression of MyD88 or the MyD88 death domain reduced co-immunoprecipitation of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2 by 60 and 70%, respectively, whereas the death domain-deleted version did not affect it (Fig. 4E). Overexpression of Bcl-2 led to a reduced association between Beclin 1 and Trif as well as MyD88 (Fig. 4F). Because Beclin 1 has a BH-3 like domain, which is critical for binding with Bcl-2, we examined the ability of a BH-3 domain mutant, Beclin 1 L116A, to associate with MyD88 and Trif. As we had observed previously, wild type Beclin 1 readily co-immunoprecipitated Trif, MyD88, and Beclin 1, whereas Beclin 1 L116A was much less efficient (Fig. 4G). These results suggested that MyD88 and Trif may actively regulate autophagy by targeting the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl2. Bcl-2 Inhibits TLR-induced Autophagy and MyD88 or Trif Compete with Bcl-2 to Regulate Beclin 1-triggered Autophagy—Given that MyD88 and Trif may regulate the Beclin 1·Bcl-2 complex, we determined whether Bcl-2 is able to attenuate TLRs-induced autophagy in RAW 267.4 cells. The GFP-LC3 autophagy marker assay showed that overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly suppressed LPS and poly(I·C)-induced autophagy (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the expression of MyD88 or Trif partially reversed the inhibition by Bcl-2 of Beclin 1-induced autophagy. Neither the death domain-deleted version of MyD88 nor the dominant negative form of Trif had a significant effect (Fig. 5B). The above results further support the concept that MyD88 and Trif are activators, whereas Bcl-2 is an inhibitor of TLR-induced autophagy and each of these proteins likely targets Beclin 1. The activation of innate immune systems is based on sensing the invasion of pathogenic microorganisms through pattern recognition receptors like Toll-like receptors, which recognize specific molecular signatures that are present in microbial components. Much attention has been focused upon TLR-mediated activation of NF-κB, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and interferon regulatory factors (4Kawai T. Akira S. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 23Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8899) Google Scholar). Here, we provide a link between TLR receptor signaling and the signaling pathway that leads to autophagy. We have focused on the signaling pathway downstream of TLR4, which leads to induction of autophagy and have shown that TLR4 adapter proteins MyD88 and Trif either directly or indirectly recruit Beclin 1 into the TLR4 signaling complex. This reduces the interaction between Beclin 1 and Bcl-2 and results in a biochemical modification of Beclin 1. The release of Beclin 1 from Bcl-2 biases the cell toward autophagy. We have also shown that TLR7-induced autophagy uses a similar mechanism. Autophagy has been shown to play a role in macrophage antimicrobial activity. It is a defense mechanism that inhibits the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in infected macrophages (24Gutierrez M.G. Master S.S. Singh S.B. Taylor G.A. Colombo M.I. Deretic V. Cell. 2004; 119: 753-766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1785) Google Scholar) and CD40 triggers autophagy in macrophages to help eliminate Toxoplasma gondii infection (25Andrade R.M. Wessendarp M. Gubbels M.J. Striepen B. Subauste C.S. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 2366-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Mice lacking MyD88 display profound defects in host resistance and immune responses to Mycobacterium avium infection not exhibited by Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)- and TLR4-deficient animals (26Scanga C.A. Aliberti J. Jankovic D. Tilloy F. Bennouna S. Denkers E.Y. Medzhitov R. Sher A. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 5997-6001Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, 27Feng C.G. Scanga C.A.

Because our investigation demonstrates defective TLR-induced autophagy from multiple Toll receptors, a failure to induce autophagy in MyD88-deficient mice could help explain the defects in host resistance in mice lacking MyD88. Recently, TLR4 has been reported to be a sensor for autophagy in RAW 264.7 macrophages. However, in contrast to our results a Trif-dependent, but MyD88 independent, the TLR4 signaling pathway was found responsible. Receptor-interacting protein (RIP1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were downstream components of the pathway (28Xu Y. Jagannath C. Liu X.D. Sharafkhaneh A. Kolodziejska K.E. Eissa N.T. Immunity. 2007; 27: 135-144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on silencing the expression of Trif, RIP1, and MyD88, by the use of a p38 inhibitor, and by the expression of a dominant negative MyD88. Data in this study that supports a role for MyD88 include the following: multiple TLRs can trigger autophagosome formation including TLRs that do not use Trif as an adapter, knock-down of MyD88 impairs TLR4-induced autophagosome formation, expression of the dominant negative version of MyD88 impaired LPS-induced autophagosome formation, overexpression of either full-length MyD88 or the N terminus of MyD88 triggered autophagosome formation, and finally that MyD88 co-immunoprecipitates with Beclin 1 and vice versa. Furthermore, it has been recently reported that TLR7-induced autophagy in RAW 264.7 depends upon MyD88 and Beclin 1 (22Delgado M.A. Elmaoued R.A. Davis A.S. Kyei G. Deretic V. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 1110-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). This report clearly supports our results. Recently, genes that encode TIR domain containing proteins have been identified in Escherichia coli CFT073 (TcpC) and Brucella melitensis (TcpB). These proteins impeded MyD88-mediated TLR signaling, and thus can suppress innate immunity and increase bacterial virulence (29Cirl C. Wieser A. Yadav M. Duerr S. Schubert S. Fischer H. Stappert D.

Data from recent preliminary experiments indicate that the expression of TcpC or TcpB impedes LPS-induced autophagy in macrophages. 4C. S. S"

The major yeast lysophospholipid acyltransferase, Ale1p, is related to mammalian membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) proteins. We expressed four human MBOATs in yeast strains lacking Ale1p and studied their acyl-CoA and lysophospholipid specificities using novel mass spectrometry-based enzyme assays. MBOAT1 is a lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS) acyltransferase with preference for oleoyl-CoA. MBOAT2 also prefers oleoyl-CoA, using lysophosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidylethanolamine as acyl acceptors. MBOAT5 prefers lysophosphatidylcholine and lyso-PS to incorporate linoleoyl and arachidonoyl chains. MBOAT7 is a lysophosphatidylinositol acyltransferase with remarkable specificity for arachidonoyl-CoA. MBOAT5 and MBOAT7 are particularly susceptible to inhibition by thimerosal. Human neutrophils express mRNA for these four enzymes, and neutrophil microsomes incorporate arachidonoyl chains into phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylcholine, PS, and phosphatidylethanolamine in a thimerosal-sensitive manner. These results strongly implicate MBOAT5 and MBOAT7 in arachidonate recycling, thus regulating free arachidonic acid levels and leukotriene synthesis in neutrophils.

These results strongly implicate MBOAT5 and MBOAT7 in arachidonate recycling, thus regulating free arachidonic acid levels and leukotriene synthesis in neutrophils. The human neutrophil is a critically important cell involved in host defense reactions. Part of the inflammatory response mounted by the neutrophil involves generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), 5The abbreviations used are: LTB4, leukotriene B4; MBOAT, membrane-bound O-acyltransferase; 20:4, arachidonic acid; LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PG, phosphatidylglycerol; PI, phosphatidylinositol; PS, phosphatidylserine; cPLA2α, cytosolic phospholipase A2 α; Fwd, forward; Rev, reverse; LPCAT, lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase. a metabolite of arachidonic acid (20:4) generated through the 5-lipoxygenase pathway. Synthesis of leukotrienes in the neutrophil is a highly complex process under considerable regulation. The initiating event involves elevation of free calcium ion concentration in the cytosol, translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 α (cPLA2α) and 5-lipoxygenase to perinuclear membranes, liberation of 20:4 mediated by cPLA2α, association of 5-lipoxygenase with its activating protein, and initiation of 20:4 oxygenation (1Murphy R.C. Gijon M.A. Biochem. J. 2007; 405: 379-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We have reported that inhibition of 20:4 reacylation with thimerosal leads to a greater than 50-fold increase in LTB4 production in human neutrophils, revealing the importance of 20:4 reacylation in limiting the availability of free 20:4 as a part of the regulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis within this cell type (2Zarini S.

The nature and identity of the lysophospholipid acyltransferase (or acyltransferases) inhibited by thimerosal has not been elucidated, yet it has been known for a number of years that the reacylation of free 20:4 into phospholipids by the Lands pathway is quite active in the human neutrophil (3Chilton F.H.

Human MBOAT5 and MBOAT7 have been shown to use 20:4-CoA as a substrate. However, there have not been any reports as to whether or not they are inhibited by low concentrations of thimerosal, a characteristic of the human neutrophil lysophospholipid acyltransferase involved in LTB4 production (2Zarini S.

Yeast strains lacking this gene (ale1Δ) are essentially devoid of lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC), lysophosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE), lysophosphatidylserine (lyso-PS), and lysophosphatidylglycerol (lyso-PG) acyltransferase activities and have drastically reduced lysophosphatidic acid (lyso-PA) and lysophosphatidylinositol (lyso-PI) acyltransferase activities. Thus, the ale1Δ strain is an ideal host for expression and assay of candidate acyltransferase genes from human and other organisms. In the present study, mRNAs for MBOATs 1, 2, 5, and 7 were detected in neutrophils, and acyltransferase activities in neutrophil microsomes were found to be consistent with the activities of several MBOAT enzymes. These four members of the human MBOAT family were also expressed in yeast and assayed with a novel LC/MS/MS-based approach, producing an extensive profile of the substrate specificities and thimerosal sensitivity for each enzyme. These results provide strong evidence that MBOATs play a critical role in the regulated synthesis of LTB4 in the human neutrophil. Materials—Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals, solvents, and amino acids for media were purchased from Sigma or Fisher. Yeast extract, peptone, and yeast nitrogen base were from Difco. Silica-60 TLC plates were from EM Sciences. All lipids were purchased from or donated by Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) except acyl-CoA substrates, which were from Sigma. Synthesis of radiolabeled lyso-PC was performed as described previously (14Riekhof W.R. Wu J. Gijon M.A. Zarini S. Murphy R.C. Voelker D.R. J. Biol.

The pYES2.1-TOPO kit and anti-V5 antibody were from Invitrogen. Identification of Human Lysophospholipid Acyltransferases—To find functional orthologs of the yeast Ale1p acyltransferase encoded by the human genome, we used BLASTP to search the human RefSeq protein data base. Four genes with E values of less than 10-10 were members of the poorly characterized family of membrane-bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing proteins: MBOAT1, MBOAT2, MBOAT5, and MBOAT7. The presence of mRNA for these genes in total RNA isolated from human neutrophils was detected by reverse transcription-PCR. Two independent preparations of cDNA from human neutrophils were kindly provided by Dr. Kenneth C. Malcolm (National Jewish Health). Primer pairs used were: MBOAT1: Fwd, 5′-TGAAGTTGCTGGAGGTGAACTGGA-3′; and Rev, 5′-GCCTTTGCGTATGAGCTTGTGGTT-3′; MBOAT2: Fwd, 5′-ATGGGCTGCTTGGCTTCTCATTTG-3′; and Rev, 5′-ACCGCAGTATTTGGAGATGGCTCT-3′; MBOAT5: Fwd, 5′-ACTGGCACCATTGCCTCATTCAAC-3′; and Rev, 5′-ACAGGCCACCAGGGAAATGGATTA-3′; and MBOAT7: Fwd, 5′-ACAGCTACTGCTACGTGGGAATCA-3′; and Rev, 5′-TGTAGTCATAGGCGCGCATCTTCA-3′. The correct size of the products was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and staining with ethidium bromide. Cloning and Expression of Human MBOAT Proteins in the Yeast ale1Δ Mutant—Plasmids containing cDNA coding for human MBOAT1 (GenBank™ accession number NM_ 001080480.1), MBOAT2 (GenBank accession number NM_138799.2), and MBOAT5 (GenBank accession number NM_005768) were purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD), and a cDNA clone for MBOAT7 (GenBank accession number AW732353) was purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL). The open reading frames were subcloned into the pYES2.1-TOPO vector according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used in amplification of the open reading frames were as follows: MBOAT1: Fwd, 5′-ATGGCAGCAGAGCCGCA-3′; and Rev, 5′-ATCTGTTTTTCTCTTATTAATAGAGTTCAG-3′; MBOAT2: Fwd, 5′-ATGGCCACCACCAGCAC-3′; and Rev, 5′-CTGCTTTAGTGATGAATGTCTCGAG-3′; MBOAT5: Fwd, 5′-ATGGCGTCCTCAGCGG-3′; and Rev, 5′-GTCCATCTTCTTTAACTTCTCTTTCCTT-3′; and MBOAT7: Fwd, 5′-ATGTCGCCTGAAGAATGGA-3′; and Rev, 5′-CTCCTCCCGGAGCTTCTCC-3′. The native start codon is underlined in the forward primer, and the stop codon was omitted in the reverse primer, giving an in-frame C-terminal fusion to the V5-His6 epitope tag encoded by the pYES2.1-TOPO vector. Clones bearing inserts with the correct orientation were identified by diagnostic restriction digestions, and several independent plasmids with correct orientation of the insert were transformed into the yeast strain BY4742 ale1Δ::KanMX (16Winzeler E.A.

Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). 2-ml cultures of these transformants were grown to midlog phase (A550 = 0.4–0.8) in synthetic complete glucose medium lacking uracil followed by harvesting of the cells and transfer to 5 ml of synthetic complete galactose medium without uracil for 16 h to induce protein expression. Homogenates of these cultures were prepared by cell disruption with glass beads as described previously (18Riekhof W.R. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36588-36596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and 30 μg of total homogenate protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using the mouse monoclonal anti-V5 antibody (at a 1:5000 dilution) to detect the epitope tag. Immunoblot bands were quantified by scanning in film mode on an Epson Perfection 4990 PHOTO scanner. Image analysis and densitometry were performed with the open source National Institutes of Health ImageJ software package (19Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar). Known quantities of a V5-His6-tagged lipid-binding protein from yeast were used for standardizing signal intensities. For biochemical studies, at least two independently isolated clones showing a strong protein expression signal of the correct molecular weight were selected for each gene. Correct gene cloning was verified by DNA sequencing, and yeast strains harboring these plasmids were used for further experiments. To produce membranes for biochemical characterization, expression culture volumes of 100–500 ml were used. Microsomes were prepared as described previously (15Riekhof W.R. Wu J. Jones J.L.

In all experiments, membranes from yeast transformed with the isogenic empty vector were used as a control. Acyl-CoA Choice Lyso-PC Acyltransferase Assay—Lyso-PC: acyl-CoA acyltransferase activity was determined by a modification of a previously published LC/MS/MS-based assay (2Zarini S.

Briefly microsomes from yeast (20 μg of protein) were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 200 μl of medium (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) containing 12.5 μm bovine serum albumin, 50 μm [2H31]16:0-lyso-PC, and 30 μm each of eight different acyl-CoA esters with the following acyl groups: 10:0, 14:0, 16:0, 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, 18:2, and 20:4. Reactions were stopped with 750 μl of methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v), and products were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) method, dried under N2, resuspended in 60 μl of high performance liquid chromatography solvent A (1 mm ammonium acetate in methanol/acetonitrile/water 60:20:20, v/v/v), and injected into the LC/MS/MS system. A gradient from 100% solvent A to 100% solvent B (1 mm ammonium acetate in methanol) was used to elute a C18 column (Columbus 150 × 2 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Solvent B was increased from 0 to 100% in 42 min and kept at 100% for 23 min before re-equilibration. Identification of the phospholipids was carried out using a Sciex API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the positive ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring of the following specific transitions: m/z 681 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/10:0-PC, m/z 737 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/14:0-PC, m/z 765 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/16:0-PC, m/z 763 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/16:1-PC, m/z 793 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/18:0-PC, m/z 791 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/18:1-PC, m/z 789 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/18:2-PC, m/z 813 → 184 for [2H31]16:0/20:4-PC, and m/z 758 → 184 for endogenous 34:2-PC. The amounts of the different phosphatidylcholines were calculated as the percentage of the integrated areas of the corresponding intensity peaks relative to the area of endogenous 34:2-PC. Dual Substrate (Acyl-CoA and Lysophospholipid) Choice Acyltransferase Assay—Acyltransferase activity was determined essentially as described above using microsomes from yeast or microsomes from human neutrophils obtained as described previously (2Zarini S. Gijon M.A. Folco G. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 10134-10142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture included the eight acyl-CoAs (30 μm each) as well as 10 μm each of 16:0-lyso-PA, [2H31]16:0-lyso-PC, 16:0-lyso-PE, 18:1-lyso-PG, 17:1-lyso-PI, and 18:1-lyso-PS. After stopping the reaction with 750 μl of methanol/chloroform (2:1, v/v), the following internal standards (5–25 ng each) were added: 17:0/14:1-PA, 17:0/20:4-PC, 17:0/20:4-PE, 17:0/20:4-PG, 17:0/20:4-PI, and 17:0/20:4-PS. Phospholipids were extracted by the Bligh and Dyer (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) method. Samples were resuspended in 75% high performance liquid chromatography solvent C (hexanes/isopropanol 30:40, v/v), 25% solvent D (1 mm ammonium acetate in hexanes/isopropanol/water 30:40:7, v/v/v) and injected into the LC/MS/MS system. A solvent gradient was used to elute a silica column (Prodigy 150 × 1 mm, 5 μm, Phenomenex) at a flow rate of 50 μl/min. Solvent D was maintained at 25% for 5 min, gradually increased to 60% in 10 min and then to 95% in 5 min, and held for 20 min prior to re-equilibration. Identification of the phospholipids was carried out using a Sciex API 3000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the negative ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring of the m/z transitions shown in Table 1. The amounts of the different phospholipid molecular species were measured by calculating the ratio of the integrated area of the corresponding intensity peaks of the analytes to the integrated areas of the peaks corresponding to the internal standard for the same phospholipid class.

Membranes prepared from the ale1Δ pYES2.1 vector-transformed control strain were included as a background control, and this background was subtracted from the counts present in MBOAT5-containing assays. The residual activity in the control membranes was always <5% of the value for the MBOAT5 membranes.

The sequence of yeast Ale1p was used to search the human protein data base for similar sequences. The most closely related proteins were MBOAT1, MBOAT2, and MBOAT5 for which no enzymatic activities had been described at the time these experiments were started. Another closely related gene, MBOAT7 (also known as LRC4, LENG4, and BB1), has recently been identified and characterized as a lyso-PI acyltransferase in an interesting study by Lee et al. (21Lee H.C. Inoue T. Imae R. Kono N. Shirae S. Matsuda S. Gengyo-Ando K. Mitani S. Arai H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 19: 1174-1184Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who proposed the name mboa-7 for the Caenorhabditis elegans gene. In addition, the enzymatic activities of murine MBOAT1, MBOAT2, and MBOAT5 have recently been reported (6Hishikawa D. Shindou H. Kobayashi S. Nakanishi H. Taguchi R. Shimizu T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The expression of MBOAT mRNA in human neutrophils was determined by PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, PCR products of the appropriate size for MBOAT1, MBOAT2, MBOAT5, and MBOAT7 were amplified from total RNA from human neutrophils. Because any of the aforementioned MBOATs could potentially be involved in 20:4 reacylation in neutrophils, all four constructs were cloned and expressed in yeast to study their enzymatic properties. Cloning and Expression of Human MBOAT Acyltransferases in Yeast—The MBOAT open reading frames were cloned into a yeast expression vector with a C-terminal fusion to a V5-His6 epitope/purification tag encoded by the vector. These constructs were then transformed into an ale1Δ strain of yeast. The full-length proteins were well expressed as determined by the presence of a ∼50-kDa signal on immunoblots using an antibody against the V5 epitope (Fig. 1B). All of these MBOAT proteins were predicted to contain six to eight transmembrane helices by the program TMHMM (22Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar, 23Sonnhammer E.L. von Heijne G. Krogh A. Proc. Int. Conf. Intell. Syst. Mol. Biol. 1998; 6: 175-182PubMed Google Scholar), and in agreement with this, the proteins were exclusively present in membrane preparations and were absent from the cytosolic fractions (100,000 × g supernatant). Two independent preparations were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry, which yielded an average MBOAT acyltransferase expression (per 30 μg of total microsomal protein) of 47 (MBOAT1), 11 (MBOAT2), 5 (MBOAT5), and 165 ng (MBOAT7). These values were used to normalize acyltransferase activity assays when comparing the different enzymes. Lyso-PC:Acyl-CoA Acyltransferase Activities of MBOAT Enzymes—In an approach similar to that used to characterize the lyso-PC acyltransferase activity of Ale1p, microsomes from yeast expressing the human MBOAT proteins were initially tested for lyso-PC acyltransferase activity using 1-[2H31]palmitoyl-2-hydroxyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (deuterated lyso-PC) and a mixture of eight fatty acyl-CoAs to study the substrate specificity of these enzymes when a choice of substrates is available (14Riekhof W.R.

As shown in Fig. 2, there was very little activity observed with membranes from ale1Δ yeast bearing the empty vector; the main product of this residual activity was [2H31]16: 0/16:1-PC. This finding shows that yeast express an enzyme, other than Ale1p, that is able to incorporate palmitoleoyl-CoA into PC albeit much less efficiently. The result also highlights the usefulness of the ale1Δ yeast as a low background model to study heterologous acyltransferases. The most abundant PC detected in these samples was non-deuterated 34:2-PC, most likely 16:1/18:1-PC present in yeast microsomes. The LC/MS/MS signal of this endogenous lipid showed some small variation between different microsomal preparations, but it provided a useful internal standard to normalize the signals of the reaction products. Microsomes from yeast expressing human MBOAT5 catalyzed increased production of 16:1- and 18:1-containing PC but especially pronounced production of PC containing 18:2 and 20:4 acyl chains. MBOAT5 exhibited very little activity with saturated acyl-CoAs containing 16:0 and 18:0 acyl chains (and also 10:0 and 14:0; not shown). The Fig. 3, inset, shows that the results of the choice assay are in good agreement with parallel assays of MBOAT5-containing microsomes with radioactive lysophospholipid and a single acyl-CoA. With either type of assay, the highest activity was with linoleoyl- and arachidonoyl-CoA. Under optimal conditions with a single acyl-CoA substrate, the enzyme used 20:4-CoA maximally with a turnover number (kcat) of ∼700 s-1. The substrate specificity of MBOAT5 was very similar between microsomes and whole cell lysates (data not shown), indicating that the presence of cytosolic proteins does not significantly affect the specificity of the enzyme for polyunsaturated acyl-CoAs. Thimerosal Sensitivity of MBOAT Lyso-PC Acyltransferase Activities—Acyltransferase activities of the four MBOAT proteins were analyzed in the presence or absence of the organomercury compound thimerosal (Fig. 4A). To better appreciate the contribution of each enzyme, the activity of microsomes from control yeast (empty vector; Fig. 4B) was subtracted from each one of the panels in Fig. 4A. Activities were also normalized for MBOAT expression levels as assessed by densitometry (see Fig. 1B). MBOAT1 showed very weak lyso-PC acyltransferase activity using 18:1-CoA preferentially. MBOAT7 also had weak but detectable and reproducible activity with 20:4-CoA. MBOAT2 exhibited higher activity with preference for 16:1-, 18:2-, and especially 18:1-CoA but no measurable activity toward 20:4-CoA. The use of 50 μm thimerosal revealed interesting differences between MBOAT activities in vitro. The residual acyltransferase activities present in control yeast (Fig. 4B), as well as MBOAT1 and MBOAT2, were only marginally inhibited by thimerosal. In contrast, thimerosal profoundly inhibited the acyltransferase activities of MBOAT5 and MBOAT7. The radiochemical assay d"
https://openalex.org/W2093418569,"The forkhead transcription factor Foxo3a is able to inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, its underlying molecular mechanism remains to be fully understood. Our present study demonstrates that Foxo3a can regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy through transactivating catalase. Insulin was able to induce cardiomyocyte hypertrophy with an elevated level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The antioxidant agents, including catalase and N-acetyl-L-cysteine, could inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy induced by insulin, suggesting that ROS is necessary for insulin to induce hypertrophy. Strikingly, we observed that the levels of catalase were decreased in response to insulin treatment. The transcriptional activity of Foxo3a depends on its phosphorylation status with the nonphosphorylated but not phosphorylated form to be functional. Insulin treatment led to an increase in the phosphorylated levels of Foxo3a. To understand the relationship between Foxo3a and catalase in the hypertrophic pathway, we characterized that catalase was a transcriptional target of Foxo3a. Foxo3a bound to the promoter region of catalase and stimulated its activity. The inhibitory effect of Foxo3a on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy depended on its transcriptional regulation of catalase. Finally, we identified that myocardin was a downstream mediator of ROS in conveying the hypertrophic signal of insulin or insulin-like growth factor-1. Foxo3a could negatively regulate myocardin expression levels through up-regulating catalase and the consequent reduction of ROS levels. Taken together, our results reveal that Foxo3a can inhibit hypertrophy by transcriptionally targeting catalase."
https://openalex.org/W2080579546,"Background Short monocular deprivation (4 days) induces a shift in the ocular dominance of binocular neurons in the juvenile mouse visual cortex but is ineffective in adults. Recently, it has been shown that an ocular dominance shift can still be elicited in young adults (around 90 days of age) by longer periods of deprivation (7 days). Whether the same is true also for fully mature animals is not yet known. Methodology/Principal Findings We therefore studied the effects of different periods of monocular deprivation (4, 7, 14 days) on ocular dominance in C57Bl/6 mice of different ages (25 days, 90–100 days, 109–158 days, 208–230 days) using optical imaging of intrinsic signals. In addition, we used a virtual optomotor system to monitor visual acuity of the open eye in the same animals during deprivation. We observed that ocular dominance plasticity after 7 days of monocular deprivation was pronounced in young adult mice (90–100 days) but significantly weaker already in the next age group (109–158 days). In animals older than 208 days, ocular dominance plasticity was absent even after 14 days of monocular deprivation. Visual acuity of the open eye increased in all age groups, but this interocular plasticity also declined with age, although to a much lesser degree than the optically detected ocular dominance shift. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that there is an age-dependence of both ocular dominance plasticity and the enhancement of vision after monocular deprivation in mice: ocular dominance plasticity in binocular visual cortex is most pronounced in young animals, reduced but present in adolescence and absent in fully mature animals older than 110 days of age. Mice are thus not basically different in ocular dominance plasticity from cats and monkeys which is an absolutely essential prerequisite for their use as valid model systems of human visual disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2002413075,"Models of honest advertisement predict that sexually selected calls should signal male quality. In most vertebrates, high quality males have larger body sizes that determine higher social status and in turn higher reproductive success. Previous research has emphasised the importance of vocal tract resonances or formant frequencies of calls as cues to body size in mammals. However, the role of the acoustic features of vocalisations as cues to other quality-related phenotypic characteristics of callers has rarely been investigated.We examined whether the acoustic structure of fallow deer groans provides reliable information on the quality of the caller, by exploring the relationships between male quality (body size, dominance rank, and mating success) and the frequency components of calls (fundamental frequency, formant frequencies, and formant dispersion). We found that body size was not related to the fundamental frequency of groans, whereas larger males produced groans with lower formant frequencies and lower formant dispersion. Groans of high-ranking males were characterised by lower minimum fundamental frequencies and to a lesser extent, by lower formant dispersions. Dominance rank was the factor most strongly related to mating success, with higher-ranking males having higher mating success. The minimum fundamental frequency and the minimum formant dispersion were indirectly related to male mating success (through dominance rank).Our study is the first to show that sexually selected vocalisations can signal social dominance in mammals other than primates, and reveals that independent acoustic components encode accurate information on different phenotypic aspects of male quality."

Two month old C57Bl6 mice were exposed to either filtered air or cigarette smoke in a smoking chamber for 5 h/day, 5 days/week for 6 months. Eyes were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde/2% paraformaldehyde and examined for ultrastructural changes by transmission electron microscopy. The contralateral eye was fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and examined for oxidative injury to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) by 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) immunolabeling and apoptosis by TUNEL labeling. Mice exposed to cigarette smoke had immunolabeling for 8-OHdG in 85±3.7% of RPE cells counted compared to 9.5±3.9% in controls (p<0.00001). Bruch membrane was thicker in mice exposed to smoke (1086±332 nm) than those raised in air (543±132 nm; p = 0.0069). The two most pronounced ultrastructural changes (severity grading scale from 0–3) seen were a loss of basal infoldings (mean difference in grade = 1.98; p<0.0001), and an increase in intracellular vacuoles (mean difference in grade = 1.7; p<0.0001). Ultrastructural changes to Bruch membrane in cigarette-smoke exposed mice were smaller in magnitude but consistently demonstrated significantly higher grade injury in cigarette-exposed mice, including basal laminar deposits (mean difference in grade = 0.54; p<0.0001), increased outer collagenous layer deposits (mean difference in grade = 0.59; p = 0.002), and increased basal laminar deposit continuity (mean difference in grade = 0.4; p<0.0001). TUNEL assay showed a higher percentage of apoptotic RPE from mice exposed to cigarette smoke (average 8.0±1.1%) than room air (average 0±0%; p = 0.043). Mice exposed to chronic cigarette smoke develop evidence of oxidative damage with ultrastructural degeneration to the RPE and Bruch membrane, and RPE cell apoptosis. This model could be useful for studying the mechanism of smoke induced changes during early AMD."
https://openalex.org/W1995953877,"While many properties of eukaryotic gene structure are well characterized, differences in the form and function of introns that occur at different positions within a transcript are less well understood. In particular, the dynamics of intron length variation with respect to intron position has received relatively little attention. This study analyzes all available data on intron lengths in GenBank and finds a significant trend of increased length in first introns throughout a wide range of species. This trend was found to be even stronger when using high-confidence gene annotation data for three model organisms (Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster) which show that the first intron in the 5′ UTR is - on average - significantly longer than all downstream introns within a gene. A partial explanation for increased first intron length in A. thaliana is suggested by the increased frequency of certain motifs that are present in first introns. The phenomenon of longer first introns can potentially be used to improve gene prediction software and also to detect errors in existing gene annotations."

Here, we investigate how exercise is associated with cognitive change and mortality in older people and, particularly, whether exercise might paradoxically increase the risk of dementia by allowing people to live longer.In the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA), of 8403 people who had baseline cognition measured and exercise reported at CSHA-1, 2219 had died and 5376 were re-examined at CSHA-2. We used a parametric Markov chain model to estimate the probabilities of cognitive improvement, decline, and death, adjusted for age and education, from any cognitive state as measured by the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination. High exercisers (at least three times per week, at least as intense as walking, n = 3264) had more frequent stable or improved cognition (42.3%, 95% confidence interval: 40.6-44.0) over 5 years than did low/no exercisers (all other exercisers and non exercisers, n = 4331) (27.8% (95% CI 26.4-29.2)). The difference widened as baseline cognition worsened. The proportion whose cognition declined was higher amongst the high exercisers but was more similar between exercise groups (39.4% (95% CI 37.7-41.1) for high exercisers versus 34.8% (95% CI 33.4-36.2) otherwise). People who did not exercise were also more likely to die (37.5% (95% CI 36.0-39.0) versus 18.3% (95% CI 16.9-19.7)). Even so, exercise conferred its greatest mortality benefit to people with the highest baseline cognition.Exercise is strongly associated with improving cognition. As the majority of mortality benefit of exercise is at the highest level of cognition, and declines as cognition declines, the net effect of exercise should be to improve cognition at the population level, even with more people living longer."

Neutrophils are the primary cell lineage that produces NE and are a key immune cell involved in pro inflammatory lung disorders. A high neutrophil burden has been linked to an increase in inflammation within the lung (9Rouhani F. Paone G. Smith N.K. Krein P. Barnes P. Brantly M.L. Chest. 2000; 117: 250S-251SAbstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and NE has been implicated in several diverse inflammatory lungs disorders including cystic fibrosis (10Doring G. Am. J Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1994; 150: S114-S117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have identified in part the intracellular signaling pathway regulated by NE (11Walsh D.E. Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. Taggart C.C. Gallagher P.M. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35494-35499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and established that NE can induce IL-8 via TLR4 (12Carroll T.P. Greene C.M. Taggart C.C. Bowie A.G. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 7594-7601Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Other studies have demonstrated partial inhibition of NE-induced IL-8 production by using specific inhibitors of TLR signaling in airway epithelial cells (12Carroll T.P. Greene C.M. Taggart C.C.

O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). NE is also likely to regulate expression of IL-8 and other genes by alternative mechanisms. In addition to TLR4, another receptor of interest which NE has been shown to trans-activate, is EGFR (14Kohri K. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L531-L540Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). EGFR plays a key role in many cellular processes (15Prenzel N. Fischer O.M. Streit S. Hart S. Ullrich A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2001; 8: 11-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar) and is important for mucin production from airway epithelial cells (16Shao M.X. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and in sustaining neutrophil inflammation (17Hamilton L.M. Torres-Lozano C. Puddicombe S.M. Richter A. Kimber I. Dearman R.J.

EGFR is a transmembrane protein consisting of an extracellular ligand-binding domain to which EGFR ligands such as transforming growth factor α (TGFα) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) bind for activation. Its intracellular domain consists of a tyrosine kinase domain. Upon activation via ligand binding, EGFR is phosphorylated on key tyrosine residues and docking of signal transducers can occur (18Herbst R.S. Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 2004; 59: 21-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). In addition to direct activation by EGFR ligands, EGFR can also be trans-activated by other stimuli such as lipoteichoic acid (19Lemjabbar H. Basbaum C. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), other TLR agonists (20Koff J.L. Shao M.X. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2008; 294: L 1068-L 1075Crossref Scopus (184) Google Scholar) and NE (16Shao M.X. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanism of NE-induced Mucin (MUC5AC) production via EGFR in NCI-H292 cells, an epithelial line derived from a mucoepidermoid pulmonary carcinoma has been documented (16Shao M.X. Nadel J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 767-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) with TNF-α-converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) shown to be involved in EGFR ligand generation. EGFR has also been implicated in NE-induced IL-8 production in lung epithelial cells (22Kuwahara I. Lillehoj E.P. Lu W. Singh I.S. Isohama Y. Miyata T. Kim K.C. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2006; 291: L407-L416Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, the in vivo biological significance of TACE in these events remains to be elucidated. Interestingly other metalloproteases in addition to TACE are reported to have a role in activation of EGFR (23Merlos-Suarez A. Ruiz-Paz S. Baselga J. Arribas J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48510-48517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We set out to understand in greater detail how NE trans-activates EGFR in human bronchial epithelial cells and to integrate this new knowledge with our current understanding of the NE mechanism of action on IL-8 expression. We postulated that a novel metalloprotease that shares redundancy with TACE is activated by NE in bronchial epithelial cells. Our aim was to identify such a protease, determine its biological activity against EGFR and TLR and elucidate its role in NE-induced activation of NFκB and regulation of IL-8 gene expression. Here we demonstrate the involvement of meprin alpha, a previously unidentified target of NE, in the NE-induced EGFR/TLR4 inflammatory pathway in human bronchial epithelial cells. Chemicals—Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Cell Culture and Treatment—16HBE14o- cells are an SV40-transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line and were obtained as a gift from D. Gruenert (University of Vermont). The cells were cultured in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, (Invitrogen). The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293, (ECACC-85120602) was cultured in Eagle's Minimal Essential Medium (EMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% NEAA (Invitrogen). 293-hTLR4-HA cells, an isolated clone of HEK293 cells stably transfected with human HA-tagged TLR4 (InvivoGen, San Diego), were cultured in DMEM, 10% FCS, 10 μg/ml blastocidin S (InvivoGen), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. NE Activity Assay—NE activity was quantified prior to all experiments using the NE substrate (0.5 mmN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide). Δ absorbance units (2 min) at 405 nm were recorded and compared with an NE standard of known activity. Zymography—Zymography was performed on 150 μl serum-free medium from untreated, EGF- or NE-treated cells (1 × 106). Samples of human or murine BALF containing 400 ng or 2 μg of protein, respectively, were treated for 10 min with sample buffer (0.25% bromphenol blue, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 40% glycerol, and 1% SDS) and were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing gelatin or casein (1 mg/ml). After electrophoresis, the gels were incubated in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2, and 2.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min, washed in the same buffer without Triton X-100 for 5 min and incubated at 37 °C overnight in the same buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The gels were stained with 0.125% Coomassie Blue and washed with 10% acetic acid and 40% methanol in water. RT PCR Analysis for Meprin Gene Expression—RNA was isolated from 16HBE14o- and HEK293 cells in TRI reagent, and RNA was extracted. RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and 2 μl was amplified with 1.25 units of TaqDNA polymerase, 1× PCR buffer, and 10 mm dNTPs (Promega) in a 50-μl volume containing 100 pmol each of the following primers: Meprin alpha: 5′-GAAATCCAGAAATGGCCTGA-3′, 5′-TGGAAATGTTCTGTCCCACA-3′; β-actin: 5′-GGGTACATGGTGGTGCCG-3′, 5′-GCCGGGAAATCGTGCGTG-3′. After a hot start, the amplification profile was 45 cycles of 1 min denaturation at 95 °C, 1 min annealing at 50 °C, and 1 min extension at 72 °C. RT-PCR amplification of meprin A and β-actin generated products of 242 bp and 402 bp, respectively. PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (24Grogan A. Reeves E. Keep N. Wientjes F. Totty N.F. Burlingame A.L. Hsuan J.J. Segal A.W. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3071-3081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some alterations. 16HBE14o- cells (1 × 105) were cultured overnight in chamber slides (Lab-Tek). Cells were washed and fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked with 10 mm NaBH4 for 1 h. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-meprin alpha (25Rosmann S. Hahn D. Lottaz D. Kruse M.N. Stocker W. Sterchi E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40650-40658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) overnight at 4 °C, or mouse anti TLR4 FITC labeled (Abcam) and EGFR (SCBT) antibody for 1 h, washed, and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody Rhodamine labeled (Abcam) at 5 μg/ml for 1 h. Controls for this experiment included cells alone, Rabbit IgG isotype control (R&D Systems) and those exposed to secondary antibody only. Meprin Activity Assay—Activity assays were carried out using the fluorogenic peptide substrate Mca-YVADAPK-(Dnp)-OH according to the manufacturer's direction (R&D Systems). Briefly, to activate meprin alpha, the enzyme (100 ng) was incubated with 0.1 ng of trypsin or 100 nm of NE in TCNB (50 nm Tris, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Brij 35, pH 7.5) for 3 h at 37 °C. Trypsin and NE were inactivated with AEBSF (1 mm) or CMK (5 μm), respectively, to prevent turnover of the meprin substrate, and fluorescence was quantified at 320 nm excitation and 450 nm emission after 60 min. IL-8 ELISA—16HBE14o- cells (1 × 105/well) were left untreated or treated for 1 h with 5 μg/ml EGFR ligand neutralizing antibody (R&D Systems), 500 nm AG1478 (Calbiochem), 2 μg of EGFR neutralizing antibody (Oncogene Ab-3), or 100 μm actinonin followed by EGF, TGFα, HBEGF, or NE for 4 h. Medium was removed and used in an IL-8 ELISA (R&D Systems). 5 μm MetOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-chloromethyl ketone (CMK) was added to NE-treated media to prevent active NE from interfering with IL-8 measurement. TGFα ELISA—Cells were untreated or treated with vehicle (DMSO) or actinonin (100 μm) for 1 h followed by NE, activated recombinant meprin alpha, or media for 4 h. For all experiments EGFR was blocked for 30 min with 2 μg/ml anti-EGFR neutralizing antibody (Calbiochem) prior to agonist treatment. Supernatants were collected, and TGFα was measured via ELISA (R&D Systems) (14Kohri K. Ueki I.F. Nadel J.A. Am. J. Physiol. Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2002; 283: L531-L540Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF)—NE gene-targeted mice were generated, as previously described (2Belaaouaj A. McCarthy R. Baumann M. Gao Z. Ley T.J. Abraham S.N. Shapiro S.D. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). NE knock-out mice (n = 3) and their wild-type littermates (n = 3) were intranasally challenged with PBS (50 μl) or PBS containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa H103 (4.8 × 106 CFUs). Twenty-four hours later, BALF was collected (26Hirche T.O. Atkinson J.J. Bahr S. Belaaouaj A. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 30: 576-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). BALF from individuals with CF (n = 11) or healthy controls (n = 10) was collected following informed consent using a protocol approved by Beaumont Hospital Ethics Committee (13Greene C.M. Carroll T.P. Smith S.G. Taggart C.C. Devaney J. Griffin S. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Samples were filtered through gauze, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and cell-free supernatants were aliquoted and stored at -80 °C. EGFR trans-Activation—16HBE14o- cells were seeded at 1 × 106 on a 6-well plate for 24 h in supplemented MEM. Cells were serum-starved in serum-free MEM for 2 h prior to stimulation and then left untreated (control) or stimulated with EGF (R&D systems) (10 ng/ml) or 100 nm NE (Elastin Products, MO) for 10 min. Medium was removed, centrifuged, and stored at -20 °C. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed using a radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, and 0.5% deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitor tablets (Roche UK) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and were used in EGFR and EGFR [pY1173] ELISAs (BIOSOURCE CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfections—16HBE14o- cells were uniformly co-transfected for 24 h with a constitutive luciferase reporter gene construct, pRLSV40 (100 ng, Promega) and an empty vector pCDNA3.1 (150 ng, Invitrogen) or the same vector carrying a gene encoding a dominant negative functionally inactive MyD88 (150 ng) as previously reported (12Carroll T.P.

Devaney J. Griffin S. O'Neill S.J. McElvaney N.G. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) using Gene Juice (Novagen). Cells were left untreated or stimulated as indicated. NFκB activation was assessed (see below) or supernatants were retained after 24 h for IL-8 ELISA, and cells were lysed with Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega) and quantified by luminometry to determine transfection efficiencies (Wallac Victor2, 1420 multilabel counter). IL-8 protein production was calculated as pg per light unit (L.U.). 293-hTLR4-HA cells (5 × 106) were transfected for 48 h with an empty vector or a plasmid expressing human EGFR (1 μg, Upstate Cat. 21–176) and left untreated or treated with agonists (as described) for 10 min prior to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA tag (InvivoGen) or an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (sc-120, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunodetection with either anti-HA tag or anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. NFκB Assays—NFκB activation was assessed by three methods. (i) Cells (5 × 105) were co-transfected as described above with an (NFκB)5-luciferase reporter plasmid and pRLSV40 for 24 h then stimulated with meprin alpha for 6 h. Relative luciferase production was quantified by luminometry. (ii and iii) Cells were co-transfected with pCDNA3 or the ΔMyD88 expression plasmid for 24 h, then stimulated with meprin for 1 h. Nuclear extracts were prepared and examined by Western blotting using p65 and TBP antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and p65/TBP ratios were quantified by densitometry or assessed 1 h post-stimulation with meprin using TransAM NFκB p65 (Actif Motif) as recommended by the manufacturer. RNAi—16HBE14o- cells (5 × 105) were transfected with 50 nm of a siRNA-targeting Meprin alpha (siRNA ID 104082, Ambion) or a scrambled control duplex (Silencer GAPDH siRNA Control Ambion) for 24 h. Cells were placed in serum-free medium and stimulated with NE (100 nm for 24h). Total RNA was extracted for qRT-PCR using the Roche LC480 and SYBR Green I Master with Meprin alpha or GAPDH (Forward: 5′-CATGAGAAGTATGACAACAGCCT-3′, Reverse: 5′-AGTCCTTCCACGATACCAAAGT-3′) primers (MWG Biotech) to quantify knockdown. Cell supernatants were retained for IL-8 ELISA. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed with the PRISM 3.0 software package (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and were compared by Student's t test or analysis of variance. Differences were considered significant at p ≤ 0.05. Identification of Novel Protease Activity from 16HBE14o- Cells Treated with NE—In our search for novel metalloproteases activated by NE, we analyzed supernatants from untreated, EGFR ligand- and NE-treated 16HBE14o- cells by zymography. Fig. 1 shows that a high molecular weight gelatinase activity, above 175 kDa, was detectable in the NE-treated supernatants but was absent from the control and EGF-treated samples (Fig. 1A). Examination of protease activity using a casein zymogram showed this high molecular weight NE-induced gelatinase also had caseinase activity of the same size, which was not present in the control, or EGF-treated samples (Fig. 1B). Based on these properties and its migration in non-reducing PAGE, this indicated that it may be meprin; therefore, we performed immunoblot analysis using an anti-meprin alpha antibody. An immunoreactive band of the same size was detected in the NE-treated samples but was not detectable in the control or EGF-treated samples (Fig. 1C). No signals were detected in any of the samples at >175 kDa using MMP2 or MMP9 antibodies (data not shown). Detection of Meprin Alpha Expression in 16HBE14o- Cells—To verify meprin alpha expression by 16HBE14o- cells RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was performed (Fig. 2). Meprin alpha mRNA was detected in 16HBE14o- cells and HEK293 cells, a human embryonic kidney cell line known to express meprin alpha (Fig. 2A). Meprin alpha has a Mr of 84.4 kDa but because of glycosylation migrates with a molecular weight of ∼90 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE (27Becker-Pauly C. Howel M. Walker T. Vlad A. Aufenvenne K. Oji V.

Fig. 2B shows a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of meprin alpha immunoprecipitated from 16HBE14o- cells using a monoclonal antibody (lane 3). Recombinant meprin alpha was used as a control (lane 1) and molecular weight markers are in lane 2. A duplicate gel was transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with a rabbit polyclonal anti-meprin alpha antibody and an immunoreactive signal of the correct molecular weight was evident in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2C). Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy were performed to visualize the location of meprin alpha in 16HBE14o- cells using a goat polyclonal anti-human meprin alpha antibody. As shown in Fig. 2D, meprin alpha expression was detected peri-nuclear and also on the cell membrane. Meprin Alpha Activated by NE Can Induce IL-8 Expression and Release TGFα from 16HBE14o- Cells—Trypsin is a potent activator of meprin alpha. We examined whether NE, like trypsin, could activate meprin alpha using a fluorimetric activity assay. A recombinant inactive form of meprin alpha was incubated with trypsin or NE, the serine proteases were inactivated, and meprin activity was measured using a substrate that had meprin specificity. Fig. 3A shows that both trypsin and NE can activate meprin to similar levels (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Having established that NE can activate meprin alpha we next evaluated whether meprin alpha, like NE, can induce IL-8 production from 16HBE14o- cells. Here cells were either untreated, treated with NE or active meprin, and IL-8 levels were quantified in cell supernatants. Fig. 3B shows that meprin alpha induced greater than 2-fold increase in IL-8 secretion compared with control cells (p < 0.001) similar to NE (p < 0.001 versus control). NE can generate soluble TGFα from 16HBE14o- cells (Fig. 3C, p = 0.03). We investigated the effect of meprin alpha on proTGFα. Cells were left untreated or treated with NE, meprin alpha, or supernatants from NE-treated 16HBE14o- cells (from which TGFα had been depleted and that had also been treated with a specific NE inhibitor). These supernatants had gelatinase activity (data not shown). TGFα levels in the cell supernatants were quantified by ELISA. Fig. 3C shows that like NE, meprin alpha or NE-treated supernatants leads to release of soluble TGFα (p = 0.01 and 0.01, respectively). Inhibition of Meprin Alpha Can Impair IL-8 Production in NE-stimulated Bronchial Epithelial Cells—NE-induced IL-8 expression is TGFα-dependent and can be inhibited using a TGFα-neutralizing antibody (Fig. 4A). Neutralizing antibodies to EGF and HBEGF have no effect. EGFR is also involved in NE-induced IL-8 expression. NE can trans-activate EGFR (Fig. 4B) and inhibition of EGFR using AG1478 or an EGFR antibody impairs NE-induced IL-8 expression (Fig. 4C). Actinonin is a naturally occurring hydroxamate that is the most effective inhibitor of meprin alpha (35Wolz R.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 144-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 36Becker C. Kruse M.N. Slotty K.A. Kohler D. Harris J.R. Rosmann S. Sterchi E.E. Stocker W. Biol.

Bull. 2007; 30: 1905-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We investigated its effects on NE-induced IL-8 and TGFα production. We performed a dose response of actinonin (0–100 μm) investigating its effect on NE-induced IL-8 expression in 16HBE14o- cells (data not shown), and from this selected 100 μm as the most effective inhibitory dose. Actinonin effectively inhibited meprin alpha activity induced by either trypsin or NE (p < 0.001 for both) (Fig. 5A) and also significantly inhibited NE-induced IL-8 (Fig. 5B) and TGFα (Fig. 5C) production from 16HBE14o- cells (#, p < 0.001). To confirm that inhibition of NE-induced IL-8 expression by actinonin is mediated via blocking meprin alpha, we next performed siRNA experiments knocking down meprin alpha (98.6% knockdown). Fig. 5D shows that NE-induced IL-8 expression is abrogated by a meprin alpha siRNA. Presence of Meprin Alpha in Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid (BALF) in Lung Inflammation Correlates with NE—We next assessed the role of meprin alpha in vivo. Meprin activity was examined in BALF of NE knock-out and wild-type mice infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Gelatin zymography detected a high molecular weight gelatinase activity above 175 kDa that was present in higher quantities in wild type (Fig. 6A, lanes 1–3) versus NE knock-out mice (lanes 4–6). We also evaluated bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls for meprin activity. CF is an inflammatory lung condition associated with high levels of active NE in the lung. Fig. 6B shows evidence of a high molecular weight gelatinase activity indicative of meprin alpha in 11 of 11 BALF samples from CF individuals. No gelatinase activity was detectable in 10 control BALF samples under the same conditions. Fig. 6C shows the corresponding NE activities per μg of protein in each of the BALF samples (p = 0.0002 for normal versus CF BALF). The gelatinase activity in 2 representative CF BALF samples was confirmed to be meprin alpha by Western immunoblotting (Fig. 6D). Meprin Induces Co-localization of EGFR and TLR4—We investigated how the NE-Meprin-TGFα-EGFR-IL-8 pathway reported here integrates with our previous reports demonstrating the NE-TLR4-MyD88-IL-8 pathway (11Walsh D.E.

https://openalex.org/W2059205152,"Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria that cause variety of human diseases. Host cells infected with Chlamydia are protected against many different apoptotic stimuli. The induction of apoptosis resistance is thought to be an important immune escape mechanism allowing Chlamydia to replicate inside the host cell. Infection with C. trachomatis activates the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and the PI3K/AKT pathway. Here we show that inhibition of these two pathways by chemical inhibitors sensitized C. trachomatis infected cells to granzyme B-mediated cell death. Infection leads to the Raf/MEK/ERK-mediated up-regulation and PI3K-dependent stabilization of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1. Consistently, interfering with Mcl-1 up-regulation sensitized infected cells for apoptosis induced via the TNF receptor, DNA damage, granzyme B and stress. Our data suggest that Mcl-1 up-regulation is primarily required to maintain apoptosis resistance in C. trachomatis-infected cells."

N-AChE-S-induced cell death was suppressible by inhibiting GSK3 or caspases, by enforced overexpression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 proteins, or by AChE inhibition or silencing. Moreover, inherent N-AChE-S was upregulated by stressors inducing protein misfolding and calcium imbalances, both characteristic of AD; and in cortical tissues from AD patients, N-AChE-S overexpression coincides with Tau hyper-phosphorylation.Together, these findings attribute an apoptogenic role to N-AChE-S and outline a potential value to AChE inhibitor therapeutics in early AD."
https://openalex.org/W1991335778,"Cu(+)-ATPases drive metal efflux from the cell cytoplasm. Paramount to this function is the binding of Cu(+) within the transmembrane region and its coupled translocation across the permeability barrier. Here, we describe the two transmembrane Cu(+) transport sites present in Archaeoglobus fulgidus CopA. Both sites can be independently loaded with Cu(+). However, their simultaneous occupation is associated with enzyme turnover. Site I is constituted by two Cys in transmembrane segment (TM) 6 and a Tyr in TM7. An Asn in TM7 and Met and Ser in TM8 form Site II. Single site x-ray spectroscopic analysis indicates a trigonal coordination in both sites. This architecture is distinct from that observed in Cu(+)-trafficking chaperones and classical cuproproteins. The high affinity of these sites for Cu(+) (Site I K(a)=1.3 fM(-1), Site II K(a)=1.1 fM(-1)), in conjunction with reversible direct Cu(+) transfer from chaperones, points to a transport mechanism where backward release of free Cu(+) to the cytoplasm is largely prevented."
https://openalex.org/W1965107569,"A model-driven discovery process, Computing Life, is used to identify an ensemble of genetic networks that describe the biological clock. A clock mechanism involving the genes white-collar-1 and white-collar-2 (wc-1 and wc-2) that encode a transcriptional activator (as well as a blue-light receptor) and an oscillator frequency (frq) that encodes a cyclin that deactivates the activator is used to guide this discovery process through three cycles of microarray experiments. Central to this discovery process is a new methodology for the rational design of a Maximally Informative Next Experiment (MINE), based on the genetic network ensemble. In each experimentation cycle, the MINE approach is used to select the most informative new experiment in order to mine for clock-controlled genes, the outputs of the clock. As much as 25% of the N. crassa transcriptome appears to be under clock-control. Clock outputs include genes with products in DNA metabolism, ribosome biogenesis in RNA metabolism, cell cycle, protein metabolism, transport, carbon metabolism, isoprenoid (including carotenoid) biosynthesis, development, and varied signaling processes. Genes under the transcription factor complex WCC ( = WC-1/WC-2) control were resolved into four classes, circadian only (612 genes), light-responsive only (396), both circadian and light-responsive (328), and neither circadian nor light-responsive (987). In each of three cycles of microarray experiments data support that wc-1 and wc-2 are auto-regulated by WCC. Among 11,000 N. crassa genes a total of 295 genes, including a large fraction of phosphatases/kinases, appear to be under the immediate control of the FRQ oscillator as validated by 4 independent microarray experiments. Ribosomal RNA processing and assembly rather than its transcription appears to be under clock control, suggesting a new mechanism for the post-transcriptional control of clock-controlled genes."
https://openalex.org/W1980084408,"Plasmodium falciparum Merozoite Surface Protein 1 (MSP1) is synthesized during schizogony as a 195-kDa precursor that is processed into four fragments on the parasite surface. Following a second proteolytic cleavage during merozoite invasion of the red blood cell, most of the protein is shed from the surface except for the C-terminal 19-kDa fragment (MSP1(19)), which is still attached to the merozoite via its GPI-anchor. We have examined the fate of MSP1(19) during the parasite's subsequent intracellular development using immunochemical analysis of metabolically labeled MSP1(19), fluorescence imaging, and immuno-electronmicroscopy. Our data show that MSP1(19) remains intact and persists to the end of the intracellular cycle. This protein is the first marker for the biogenesis of the food vacuole; it is rapidly endocytosed into small vacuoles in the ring stage, which coalesce to form the single food vacuole containing hemozoin, and persists into the discarded residual body. The food vacuole is marked by the presence of both MSP1(19) and the chloroquine resistance transporter (CRT) as components of the vacuolar membrane. Newly synthesized MSP1 is excluded from the vacuole. This behavior indicates that MSP1(19) does not simply follow a classical lysosome-like clearance pathway, instead, it may play a significant role in the biogenesis and function of the food vacuole throughout the intra-erythrocytic phase."
https://openalex.org/W2024563086,"Morphogenesis of infectious HIV-1 involves budding of immature virions followed by proteolytic disassembly of the Gag protein shell and subsequent assembly of processed capsid proteins (CA) into the mature HIV-1 core. The dimeric interface between C-terminal domains of CA (C-CA) has been shown to be important for both immature and mature assemblies. We previously reported a CA-binding peptide (CAI) that blocks both assembly steps in vitro. The three-dimensional structure of the C-CA/CAI complex revealed an allosteric effect of CAI that alters the C-CA dimer interface. Based on this structure, we now investigated the phenotypes of mutations in the binding pocket. CA variants carrying mutations Y169A, L211A, or L211S had a reduced affinity for CAI and were unable to form mature-like particles in vitro. These mutations also blocked morphological conversion to mature virions in tissue culture and abolished infectivity. X-ray crystallographic analyses of the variant C-CA domains revealed that these alterations induced the same allosteric change at the dimer interface observed in the C-CA/CAI complex.

The CA segment within Gag plays a key role in both processes. Its modular structure with separately folded N- and C-terminal domains (N-CA; C-CA) connected by a flexible hinge allows for an essential conformational plasticity. Structural details of the protein interfaces of the immature shell are currently not known, whereas two assembly interfaces of the mature lattice are well described.

CA dimerizes in solution with a Kd of 18 μm, and dimerization is mainly mediated by residues Trp-184 and Met-185 (13Gamble T.R. Yoo S. Vajdos F.F. von Schwedler U.K. Worthylake D.K. Wang H.

The recent structural determination of the assembled structure of a CA variant (24Ganser-Pornillos B.K. Cheng A. Yeager M. Cell. 2007; 131: 70-79Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) showed that this cross-domain interaction takes place between adjacent CA subunits within a hexamer, acting as a third assembly interface. Assembly appears to be a good target for antivirals as it depends on repetitive weak protein interactions, and disruption of only part of these interactions may be sufficient for suppression of infectivity in a dominant negative fashion. However, no approved antiviral targeting assembly is currently known. In our previous study we used a phage-display screen to identify a 12-mer peptide termed capsid assembly inhibitor (CAI) that bound to C-CA and blocked in vitro assembly of mature-like and immature-like particles (25Sticht J. Humbert M. Findlow S. Bodem J. Müller B. Dietrich U. Werner J. Kräusslich H.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 671-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The peptide was inactive in tissue culture, most likely because of poor uptake and stability, but could be modified to become active against different HIV-1 strains at micromolar concentration in tissue culture (26Zhang H. Zhao Q. Bhattacharya S. Waheed A.A. Tong X. Hong A. Heck S. Curreli F. Goger M. Cowburn D. Freed E.O. Debnath A.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 565-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). We determined the high resolution structure of C-CA in complex with CAI at 1.7 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography (27Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Kräusslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). CAI binds within a conserved hydrophobic groove formed by three helices of C-CA and wedges this cavity open. The peptide inserts as an amphipathic α-helix making predominantly hydrophobic interactions. CAI binding also exerts an allosteric change that affects the quaternary structure of the C-CA dimer. To understand the mechanism of action of CAI and investigate the potential for resistance against compounds binding to this pocket, we performed a mutational analysis of C-CA residues mediating the strongest interaction with CAI. All variant proteins were analyzed regarding CAI binding, assembly properties, polyprotein processing, infectivity, and viral morphology. Furthermore, x-ray structures of variant C-CA proteins alone and in complex with CAI were determined. Our results revealed that the reactive conserved hydrophobic groove of C-CA is crucial for correct formation of the mature HIV-1 capsid and for viral infectivity. Unexpectedly, the three-dimensional structures showed that individual changes abolishing mature assembly induced the same change in the quaternary organization of the C-CA dimer as binding of CAI. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that CAI exerts its inhibitory effect not only by blocking the N-CA/C-CA interaction in the mature assembly but also by altering the dimeric interaction that relates hexamers in the lattice, explaining the lack of assembly competence of variants that display an equally altered dimer interface. Proteins and Peptides—All expression vectors were derived from pET11c (Novagen) (11Gross I. Hohenberg H. Kräusslich H.G. Eur. J.

All mutations were introduced by PCR mutagenesis and confirmed by sequence analysis; protein variants of CA, C-CA, CANC, and ΔMACANCSP2 proteins were purified as described (11Gross I. Hohenberg H.

Protein and peptide concentrations were estimated spectrophotometrically using calculated extinction coefficients. Determination of Dissociation Constants by Fluorescence Polarization—CAI was C-terminal-extended by a cysteine residue and labeled with 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein. The labeled peptide showed no significant difference in assembly inhibition compared with CAI. Labeled CAI was dissolved in DMSO at 10 mm concentration. CA proteins were stored in 30 mm MES, pH 6.0, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol at concentrations 250-500 μm. The final reaction buffer consisted of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 2 mm dithiothreitol with 10-20% protein storage buffer. HIV-1 CA variants (0-60 μm) were incubated with 30 nm fluorescein-labeled CAI for 2 h at room temperature in triplicate in black 384-well ProxiPlates (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in a final volume of 15 μl. The fluorescence polarization signal was detected on an EnVision™ Multilabel Plate Reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) at excitation wavelength 495 nm and emission wavelength 520 nm. Median values were fitted to a one-site binding model from which the dissociation constant was directly calculated (GraphPad Prism). Cell Culture and Detection Methods—All mutations were introduced into the infectious proviral plasmid pNL4-3 (28Adachi A. Gendelman H.E. Koenig S. Folks T. Willey R. Rabson A. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1986; 59: 284-291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by introducing the SphI/ApaI fragment from the respective ΔMACANCSP2 constructs. 293T cells in 6 wells (5 × 105 cells/well) were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid using standard calcium phosphate precipitation. Released particles were harvested 48 h after transfection and purified from filtrated supernatant through a 20% sucrose cushion. Cell and particle lysates were resolved on 17.5% low cross-linking polyacrylamide gels and probed with anti-CA (1:5,000) followed by horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000) to produce a chemiluminescent signal (SuperSignal™ CL-HRP System, Pierce). For quantitative Western blots, donkey anti-rabbit antibody (IRDye 800CW; 1:20,000) was used as a secondary antibody, and the infrared signal was detected using the Odyssey Imaging System (LI-COR™). For TCID50 infectivity assays, 3 × 104 C8166 cells/well were plated into 96-well plates 1 day before infection. Transfection supernatants were cleared by low speed centrifugation and titrated in 10-fold serial dilutions (10-1-10-10) in quadruplicate on C8166 cells. Cells were microscopically examined for cytopathic effects and formation of syncytia for 6-7 days. Virus titer was calculated using the Karber formula (30Hawkes R.A. Lennette E.H. Schmidt N.J. Diagnostic Procedures for Viral, Rickettsial, and Chlamydial Infections. American Public Health Association, Washington, D. C.1979: 32-35Google Scholar). In Vitro Assembly and EM Analysis—In vitro assembly of ΔMACANCSP2, CANC, and CA was induced by dialysis as described (11Gross I. Hohenberg H. Kräusslich H.G. Eur. J.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar); assembled material was pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 17,600 × g and resuspended in dialysis buffer in a quarter of the original volume. Assembled particles were adsorbed onto glow-discharged, Formvar, and carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 5 min. Samples were examined using a Zeiss EM 10 transmission electron microscope. To quantify the in vitro assembly efficiencies of wild-type and L211S CA proteins and their mixtures (at molar ratios from 2:1 to 1:10; final CA concentration 3 mg/ml), the number and length of tubular particles was determined for at least 25 view fields at a magnification of 20,000, and the average per view field was calculated. For EM analysis of HIV-1 producing cells, HeLaP4 cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 as specified by the manufacturer (Roche Applied Science). Cells were briefly washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, 36 h after transfection. Samples were stained in situ with 2% OsO4 in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, followed by dehydration with ethanol, post-staining with 6% uranyl acetate, and incubation with propylene oxide. Subsequently, cells were scraped from the plates, and the cell pellet was embedded in EPON and processed by ultrathin sectioning. Micrographs were taken using a Zeiss EM 10 transmission electron microscope. Viral particles (200-250 for each variant) were grouped as mature, immature, and budding particles, and mature particles were subsequently classified according to core shape (conical, diffuse, eccentric, or empty core). Crystallization—Protein concentrations used for crystallization were 2 mm for unliganded proteins and 1 mm for the C-CA/CAI complexes. The latter were formed at a 1:2 molar ratio by incubating for 1 h at room temperature. All crystals were obtained at room temperature by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method, mixing 1 μl of protein or complex and 1 μl of the reservoir solution. Crystallization conditions of the N183A and E187A variants were similar to those that led to crystals of the wild-type C-CA/CAI complex. The conditions for variants N183A and E187A were 30%/32% PEG 4000, 100 mm ammonium acetate, pH 4.6/5.0, and 10 mm MgCl2, respectively. The Y169A and L211S crystallization conditions were 20% PEG 3350, 200 mm sodium iodine and 30% PEG 4000, 100 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 200 mm CaCl2, respectively.

Open table in a new tab In Vitro Assembly Properties of CAI Binding Mutants—Based on the structure of C-CA in complex with CAI (27Ternois F. Sticht J. Duquerroy S. Kräusslich H.G. Rey F.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), CA residues Tyr-169, Asn-183, Glu-187, and Leu-211 (Fig. 1A) were selected for mutagenesis experiments. All four residues are conserved among the lentiviruses (with conservative Y169F and E187Q exchanges; Fig. 1B), and Leu-211 is also conserved in most other retroviruses except for Rous sarcoma virus. The changes were predicted to affect CAI binding for the following reasons; the aromatic ring of Tyr-169 forms a stacking interaction with its counterpart from CAI residue Tyr-10. Asn-183 provides an N-terminal cap to the CAI α-helix, thus helping stabilization of the α-helical conformation of the peptide. Glu-187 is located at the kink of helix 2, which forms the C-CA dimer interface, a helix that becomes straightened upon CAI binding. Furthermore, the charged side chain of Glu-187 interacts with the electrostatic dipole of the CAI α-helix. Finally, Leu-211 is an essential part of the hydrophobic binding pocket, interacting closely with CAI residues Ile-1 and Leu-6. Alanine was chosen as substitute because it is most likely neutral for the secondary structure of the protein; in the case of Leu-211, an additional change to serine was introduced to analyze the effect of a polar amino acid on the nonpolar groove. The individual mutations were introduced into a CA expression plasmid, and mutant CA proteins were purified from E. coli. The dissociation constants of wild-type and mutant complexes were determined using fluorescence polarization. Increasing concentrations of the respective CA variant were incubated with fluorescently labeled CAI, and the increase in polarization of the emitted signal dependent on complex formation was determined. The data were fitted to a one-site binding model, and the Kd values were calculated (Table 1). The complex of wild-type CA and CAI exhibited a Kd value of 1.6 ± 0.1 μm. This number is about 10-fold lower than the Kd determined by NMR analysis for the complex of CAI with a dimerization defective C-CA variant (C-CAW184A/M185A) (25Sticht J. Humbert M. Findlow S.

https://openalex.org/W2072545085,"The role of B cells in allergic asthma remains undefined. One mechanism by which B cells clearly contribute to allergic disease is via the production of specific immunoglobulin, and especially IgE. Cognate interactions with specific T cells result in T cell help for B cells, resulting in differentiation and immunoglobulin secretion. Proximal to (and required for) T cell-dependent immunoglobulin production, however, is antigen presentation by B cells. While interaction with T cells clearly has implications for B cell function and differentiation, this study investigated the role that B cells have in shaping the T cell response during chronic allergic lung disease.In these studies, we used a clinically relevant mouse model of chronic allergic lung disease to study the role of B cells and B cell antigen presentation in this disease. In these studies we present several novel findings: 1) Lung B cells from chronically allergen challenged mice up-regulated MHC II and costimulatory molecules CD40, CD80 and CD86. 2) Using in vitro studies, B cells from the lungs of allergen challenged mice could present antigen to T cells, as assessed by T cell proliferation and the preferential production of Th2 cytokines. 3) Following chronic allergen challenge, the levels of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 in the lungs and airways were significantly attenuated in B cell -/- mice, relative to controls. 4) B cell driven Th2 responses and mucus hyper secretion in the lungs were dependent upon MHC II expression by B cells.Collectively, these results provide evidence for antigen presentation as a novel mechanism by which B cells contribute to chronic allergic disease. These findings give new insight into the mechanisms by which B cells promote asthma and other chronic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1966242446,"Background The choroid plexus (ChP), a component of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), produces the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and as a result plays a role in (i) protecting and nurturing the brain as well as (ii) in coordinating neuronal migration during neurodevelopment. Until now ChP development was not analyzed in living vertebrates due to technical problems. Methodology/Principal Findings We have analyzed the formation of the fourth ventricle ChP of zebrafish in the GFP-tagged enhancer trap transgenic line SqET33-E20 (Gateways) by a combination of in vivo imaging, histology and mutant analysis. This process includes the formation of the tela choroidea (TC), the recruitment of cells from rhombic lips and, finally, the coalescence of TC resulting in formation of ChP. In Notch-deficient mib mutants the first phase of this process is affected with premature GFP expression, deficient cell recruitment into TC and abnormal patterning of ChP. In Hedgehog-deficient smu mutants the second phase of the ChP morphogenesis lacks cell recruitment and TC cells undergo apoptosis. Conclusions/Significance This study is the first to demonstrate the formation of ChP in vivo revealing a role of Notch and Hedgehog signalling pathways during different developmental phases of this process."
https://openalex.org/W1997180803,"The G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR54 is essential for the development and maintenance of reproductive function in mammals. A point mutation (L148S) in the second intracellular loop (IL2) of GPR54 causes idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a disorder characterized by delayed puberty and infertility. Here, we characterize the molecular mechanism by which the L148S mutation causes disease and address the role of IL2 in Class A GPCR function. Biochemical, immunocytochemical, and pharmacological analysis demonstrates that the mutation does not affect the expression, ligand binding properties, or protein interaction network of GPR54. In contrast, diverse GPR54 functional responses are markedly inhibited by the L148S mutation. Importantly, the leucine residue at this position is highly conserved among class A GPCRs. Indeed, mutating the corresponding leucine of the α1A-AR recapitulates the effects observed with L148S GPR54, suggesting the critical importance of this hydrophobic IL2 residue for Class A GPCR functional coupling. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation studies indicate that L148S does not hinder the association of Gα subunits with GPR54. However, fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis strongly suggests that L148S impairs the ligand-induced catalytic activation of Gα. Combining our data with a predictive Class A GPCR/Gα model suggests that IL2 domains contain a conserved hydrophobic motif that, upon agonist stimulation, might stabilize the switch II region of Gα. Such an interaction could promote opening of switch II of Gα to facilitate GDP-GTP exchange and coupling to downstream signaling responses.

Importantly, mutations that disrupt this key hydrophobic interface can manifest as human disease. A diverse network of signaling pathways have evolved within the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis to ensure precise neuroendocrine regulation of reproductive function in mammals (1Tena-Sempere M. Huhtaniemi I.T. Fauser B. Reproductive Medicine: Molecular, Cellular and Genetic Fundamentals. Parthenon Publishing, New York2003: 225-244Google Scholar). An essential feature of this physiological system is the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone from hypothalamic neurons, which subsequently initiates follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone release from the pituitary and ultimately impinges on the gonads to elicit sex steroid secretion (2Belchetz P.E. Plant T.M. Nakai Y. Keogh E.J. Knobil E. Science. 1978; 202: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). Together, the components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis function with precise temporal and spatial accuracy to regulate the development and maintenance of proper reproductive function, including puberty onset and the estrous cycle (3Seminara S.B.

Unfortunately, however, in the absence of a crystal structure of a GPCR in complex with a G-protein, the specific sites that comprise the GPCR-G-protein interface remain relatively undefined. Thus, enhancing our understanding of the exact mechanism by which agonist binding to a GPCR engages G-proteins and activates intracellular signaling cascades remains one of the most elusive and intriguing areas of research in the GPCR field. Herein, we utilize biochemical and pharmacological techniques to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which the clinically relevant L148S mutation of GPR54 causes disease and assess the importance of this IL2 residue for proper Class A GPCR-G-protein coupling. Specifically, we have developed an in vitro model to ascertain whether the L148S mutation causes defects in the expression, trafficking, or signaling and/or alters the protein interaction network of GPR54. Importantly, characterization of L148S hGPR54 revealed that conserved residues in the IL2 of Class A GPCRs are essential for functional interactions between the GPCR and G-protein, specifically Gα. Docking analysis of Gα to the recently solved β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) crystal structure (26Cherezov V. Rosenbaum D.M. Hanson M.A. Rasmussen S.G.F. Thian F.S. Kobilka T.S. Choi H.-J. Kuhn P. Weis W.I. Kobilka B.K. Stevens R.C. Science. 2007; 318: 1258-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar) predicts a molecular model whereby hydrophobic interactions between the IL2 of Class A GPCRs and conserved residues of Gα subunits stabilize the switch II region of activated Gα in a conformation that facilitates GDP-GTP exchange and thus maximizes downstream effector signaling. Thus, the IL2 of Class A GPCRs could act as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) during agonist-mediated activation of Gα. Constructs—cDNA for human GPR54 (hGPR54) in pEFIN3 was kindly provided by Dr. Marc Parmentier (University of Brussels). hGPR54 was amplified by PCR to add 5′ EcoRI and 3′ BamHI sites for subcloning into pcDNA3.1 containing an N-terminal FLAG or hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag. 5′ BamHI and 3′ XhoI sites were added using PCR to subclone hGPR54 into pEGFP-N3 containing a C-terminal GFP epitope tag. QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce the L148S mutation into hGPR54 and L132S mutation into the human α1A-AR and to create various Leu148 amino acid substitutions. Gα15/16 and Gαq in pcDNA3.1 were obtained from the UMR cDNA Resource Center (available on the World Wide Web), and an N-terminal HA tag was added to Gα15/16 to facilitate immunodetection. cDNA for mouse Gαq-eCFP, bovine eYFP-Gβ1, and bovine GRK2 were kindly provided by Bertil Hille (University of Washington). Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Plates were grown to ∼70% confluence for transfection. cDNA constructs were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), and cells were used for experimentation 24-48 h post-transfection. Cells were treated with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen) to generate polyclonal stable cell lines. Tandem Affinity Purification and Mass Spectrometry—Tandem affinity purification (TAP) was conducted as previously described with minor modifications (27Daulat A.M. Maurice P. Froment C.

The expression vector was designed to position tandem streptavidin-binding protein, HA, and calmodulin-binding protein affinity tags at the N terminus of GPR54. Stable HEK293 cell lines expressing wild type (WT) or L148S hGPR54 were lysed overnight in buffer containing 1% digitonin. Solubilized protein was incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with 50 mm d-biotin. Eluate was incubated with calmodulin-Sepharose, washed, and eluted with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.0) plus 25 mm EDTA. Final eluate was analyzed via mass spectrometry (LTQ-FT or LTQ Orbitrap). We used a PeptideProphet™ score of greater than 0.65 to identify positive hits from the TAP/MS results. This cut-off provided a sensitivity of 0.744 and 0.737 for WT hGPR54 and L148S hGPR54, respectively, and an error rate of 0.074 and 0.064 for WT hGPR54 and L148S hGPR54, respectively. Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged hGPR54 constructs were split onto 35-mm dishes containing 25-mm glass coverslips and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 4% horse serum, stained for 2 min with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole/PBS (Invitrogen), washed again with PBS, and mounted onto slides. Cells were imaged with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope. GFP was excited using an argon laser (λ = 488 nm) and detected at 510-520 nm. GFP Immunoprecipitation/Immunoblotting—Confluent 150-mm plates of HEK293 cells were washed with PBS, scraped, and centrifuged at 5,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X) and passed through a 20-gauge needle 10 times at 4 °C. Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 15 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. Proteins concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). Cell lysates were then incubated with mouse anti-GFP antibody (1 mg of cell lysate per 2 μg of antibody) (ab1218; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) in cell lysis buffer without detergent overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added to the mixture and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. To pellet beads, samples were centrifuged at 500 × g, and supernatants were collected, resuspended in 50 μl laurel dodecyl sulfate sample buffer, and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were then run on 10% BisTris gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with a rabbit anti-GFP antibody (ab6556; Abcam) in 3% milk/TBST. Blots were washed with TBST and probed with IRDye® 800CW goat α-rabbit IgG (LI-COR, Lincoln, NB). Bands were detected by fluorescence at 680 and 800 nm using the Odyssey Detection System. Radioligand Binding—Confluent 150-mm plates of HEK293 cells were scraped into PBS at 4 °C, subjected to Polytron homogenization, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in PBS, rehomogenized, and recentrifuged at 15,000 × g. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce). For hGPR54 radioligand binding assays, samples were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-labeled KP-10 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), a synthetic full agonist for GPR54, in the absence (total bound) or presence (nonspecific bound) of 0.5 μm unlabeled KP-10. For α1A-AR radioligand binding assays, samples were incubated with increasing concentrations of [3H]prazosin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence (total bound) or presence (nonspecific bound) of 10 μm phentolamine. Samples were incubated at 37 °C with gentle shaking. Bound drug was determined by passing samples through a Brandel Cell Harvester (Brandel, Gaithersburg, MD) containing glass fiber filter paper. For [3H]prazosin, 5 ml of liquid scintillation fluid was added per sample. Samples were counted, and specific bound drug was determined by subtracting nonspecific from total bound. Data were then analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA) to calculate KD and Bmax values using nonlinear regression. [3H]Phosphoinositol Hydrolysis—HEK293 cells were split into 24-well plates (1 million cells/well) and incubated with 1 μCi of myo-[3H]inositol. 24 h later, the medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of Krebs buffer (129 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 0.029 mm Na2EDTA) containing 10 mm LiCl. Cells were incubated with or without agonist for 1 h, and reactions were stopped by aspirating Krebs buffer and adding 750 μl of ice-cold methanol. 100 μm Kisspeptin (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA) stocks were prepared in sterile PBS. Samples were scraped into 500 μl of chloroform, ultrasonicated, and separated using anion exchange chromatography. Total [3H]inositol phosphates produced were quantified using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad) to calculate agonist EC50 values and intrinsic activities. ERK1/2 Activation—The protocol previously described in Ref. 29Chen H. Kovar J. Sissons S. Cox K. Matter W. Chadwell F. Luan P. Vlahos C.J. Schutz-Geschwender A. Olive D.M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 338: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar was used with minor modifications. HEK293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at ∼150,000 cells/well. Cells were serum-starved for 4 h to reduce background ERK1/2 activation, and agonists were then added to wells and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. To terminate the reaction, plates were put on ice, medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldeyde at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X and probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 and anti-total ERK1/2 antibodies (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed with PBS plus 0.1% Tween 20 buffer and incubated for 1 h with IRDye®800CW- and IRDye®680-conjugated second antibodies (LiCor Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE). Cells were then washed three times with PBS, and the PBS was removed by gently tapping the plate upside down onto a paper towel. Plates were imaged using the Odyssey Detection System, and GraphPad Prism software was used to quantify data, which are expressed as percentage of the epidermal growth factor maximal response. Fluorescence-activated Cell Sorting Analysis—Approximately 200,000 cells were washed and pelleted in PBS plus 2% BSA (PBS+) in 5-ml polystyrene round bottom test tubes (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA). 100 μl of PBS+ with primary antibody (5 μg/ml; catalog number 12CA5; Roche Applied Science) was added to each tube, and cells were dislodged by gentle flicking. Cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, pelleted, washed three times in PBS+, resuspended in secondary antibody at 1 μg/ml (Invitrogen GAM Alexa Fluor®), and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then pelleted and washed three times in PBS+. Fluorescence intensity was measured using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). As a negative control, primary antibody was omitted. Structural Modeling—Limited structural information on the β2-AR IL3 led us to use the TASSER-generated structural model of GPR54 (30Zhang Y. Devries M.E. Skolnick J. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2006; 2: 88-99Crossref Scopus (212) Google Scholar) for initial docking of the crystal structure of the activated Gαq subunit (Protein Data Bank code 2BCJ). We used the RosettaDock protein-protein docking server for docking procedures (31Gray J.J. Moughon S. Wang C. Schueler-Furman O. Kuhlman B. Rohl C.A. Baker D. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 331: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). The GPR54 computational model was refined and replaced using the crystal structure of the β2-AR (Protein Data Bank code 2RH1). Co-immunoprecipitation of GPR54 and Gq Family Members—150-mm plates of HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with TAP-WT or L148S hGPR54 and Gαq or Gα15/16. After 24 h, cells were harvested, lysed with TAP buffer, cleared, and incubated overnight with streptavidin-Sepharose. Beads were washed with TAP buffer minus digitonin and boiled in 50 μl of laurel dodecyl sulfate sample buffer. Immunoblotting was performed as previously described with anti-Gq (1:1000; catalog number G612704; BD Biosciences) and anti-HA (1:1000; Cell Signaling) antibodies. Co-purification of GPR54 IL2 and Gαq—An overlapping primer strategy was used to clone the WT and L148S hGPR54 IL2 into a pGEX-2T-based, N-terminal GST expression vector. Gαq was subcloned into the pAL vector for the expression of N-terminal His6-Gαq fusion protein. The IL2 and Gαq fusions were co-transformed into Escherichia coli. A colony was picked and grown in 1 liter of Luria broth at 37 °C. isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.02 m) was added to the cell culture when the A600 reached 1.0, and culture was continued at 18 °C overnight. Cells were harvested and suspended in His lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 2 mm imidazole, 3 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). After sonication and centrifugation, the supernatant was loaded on a 2-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Bound His-Gαq was eluted using 200 mm imidazole. The eluted proteins were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. To determine the strength of the interaction, the column was washed with increasing amounts of NaCl (300-900 mm). Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)—To measure ratiometric FRET between CFP and YFP, we performed photometric measurements on single cells excited by a 75-watt xenon arc lamp and measured on an inverted Nikon diaphot microscope. Excitation light was filtered by a 0.3 neutral density filter and a cube containing a 436 ± 10-nm bandpass filter and a 460-nm dichroic mirror. Emitted light was separated by two cubes in series; a 505-nm dichroic mirror with a 480 ± 15-nm bandpass filter directed light to one photomultiplier tube (“short wavelength channel”), and a 570-nm dichroic mirror with a 535 ± 12.5-nm bandpass filter directed light to the other photomultiplier tube (“long wavelength channel”). The shutter was opened for 24 ms every 500 ms. Solution was exchanged using a θ tube moved by a step-driven motor and was complete within 100 ms. The FRET ratio was taken as the ratio of YFP to CFP emission after single-fluorophore corrections for background fluorescence, bleed-through, and direct excitation. FRET ratio = FYFP/FCFP = 0.98 (LW - 0.17®SW)/SW, where SW and LW are counts in the short and long wavelength channels. Changes in FRET ratio provide a good measure of interaction kinetics. To check membrane expression, cells were imaged using a Zeiss SP1 confocal microscope with a 100× oil immersion objective. L148S hGPR54 Expression, Localization, and Ligand Binding Are Equivalent to Those of WT hGPR54—To address the mechanism by which a single L148S amino acid conversion results in GPR54 loss of function, we compared the expression, localization, and pharmacological characteristics of L148S and WT GPR54. We thus generated polyclonal HEK293 cell lines stably expressing WT or L148S mutant human GPR54 (L148S hGPR54) with either N-terminal (HA or FLAG) or C-terminal (GFP) epitope tags. Immunoprecipitation of WT and L148S hGPR54-GFP showed that both WT and mutant receptors were expressed at the expected molecular mass of ∼70 kDa, demonstrating that the mutation does not interfere with protein expression (Fig. 1A). Confocal analysis revealed that WT and L148S hGPR54-GFP cellular localization patterns were indistinguishable, suggesting that the L148S mutation does not cause trafficking or expression deficits of GPR54 (Fig. 1B). To obtain a quantitative measurement of plasma membrane expression, we employed fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis to detect the N-terminal HA tag of WT and L148S hGPR54. As shown in Fig. 1C, the cell surface expression of L148S HA-hGPR54 was statistically equivalent to WT HA-hGPR54 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that this mutation does not prevent GPR54 from reaching the plasma membrane in vitro. To address the potential effects of this mutation on ligand binding, we performed 125I-labeled KP-10 saturation radioligand binding assays on HEK293 cells stably expressing WT and L148S hGPR54. KP-10 is a synthetic 10-amino acid peptide that displays full agonist properties for GPR54. Saturation analysis demonstrated that L148S hGPR54 bound 125I-label"

This process is completed by the epidermal cells which are controlled by 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) and juvenile hormone. To understand the molecular mechanisms of integument remolding and hormonal regulation on the gene expression, an epidermal cell line from the 5th instar larval integument of Helicoverpa armigera was established and named HaEpi. The cell line has been cultured continuously for 82 passages beginning on June 30, 2005 until now. Cell doubling time was 64 h. The chromosomes were granular and the chromosome mode was from 70 to 76. Collagenase I was used to detach the cells from the flask bottom. Non-self pathogen AcMNPV induced the cells to apoptosis. The cell line was proved to be an epidermal cell line based on its unique gene expression pattern. It responded to 20E and the non-steroidal ecdysone agonist RH-2485. Its gene expression could be knocked down using RNA interference. Various genes in the cell line were investigated based on their response to 20E. This new cell line represents a platform for investigating the 20E signaling transduction pathway, the immune response mechanism in lepidopteran epidermis and interactions of the genes."

In our study we analyzed the impact of H. pylori infection on the regulation of β-catenin, which plays a central role in both cell adhesion and tumorigenesis. Infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with H. pylori led to suppression of Ser/Thr phosphorylation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of β-catenin and to up-regulation of lymphoid enhancer-binding factor/T cell factor (LEF/TCF)-dependent transcription. The impaired Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin was accompanied by an increase of glycogen synthase kinase 3β phosphorylation. Inhibition of Akt kinase, an up-stream regulator of glycogen synthase kinase 3, by a specific inhibitor Akti-1/2 or depletion of Akt with siRNA restored Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin. We conclude that glycogen synthase kinase 3β activity exerts an important role in β-catenin regulation and LEF/TCF transactivation in H. pylori-infected Madin-Darby canine kidney cells.

The level of free β-catenin in the cytoplasm is controlled by ubiquitinylation and degradation in the 26 S proteasome (14Aberle H. Bauer A. Stappert J. Kispert A. Kemler R.

Neumann M. Schneider-Brachert W. Naumann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). MG132, Akti-1/2 (Akt inhibitor VIII), LY294002, AG1478, AG828, and U73122 were purchased from Calbiochem. LiCl and DMSO were purchased from Sigma. PHA-665752 was kindly provided (Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals). Cell Culture and Bacteria—MDCK cell line (European Collection of Cell Cultures) and AGS cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin in a humid atmosphere at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For infection with H. pylori, MDCK cells (2 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) were grown in complete medium to reach 70% of confluency. 16 h before infection the complete medium was replaced by fresh RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum. The H. pylori strain P1 wild type (wt) and isogenic mutants cagA and virB7 (26Foryst-Ludwig A. Neumann M. Schneider-Brachert W. Naumann M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 316: 1065-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 27Schmitt W. Haas R. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) were cultured for 48-72 h as described (28Churin Y. Al-Ghoul L. Kepp O. Meyer T.F. Birchmeier W. Naumann M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) and added to the epithelial cells at a multiplicity of infection of 100. Heat-inactivated H. pylori was prepared by incubating bacteria suspension at 65 °C for 15 min. Transfection and Reporter Gene Assay—pSP65/SRα-CagA-HA plasmid encoding CagA was kindly provided by M. Hatakeyama (Sapporo, Japan). MDCK cells (2 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) were transfected with 0.1 μg of DNA (DNA/Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) ratio was 1:10). 48 h later the cells were subjected either to subcellular fraction separation or to cell lysate preparation. MDCK cells (2 × 104 cells/35 mm dish) were transfected with 0.1 μg of siRNA against human Akt1/2 (100% sequence homology to canine Akt2 mRNA) or with control (non-targeting) siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using siLentFect™ Lipid Reagent (Bio-Rad). At 24 h of transfection, cells were infected with H. pylori for 24 h. For luciferase reporter assay, MDCK cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 0.6 × 104 cells per well 1 day before transfection. The cells were transfected with 0.1 μg of Firefly TOP- or FOPflash (Biomol) and 0.01 μg of Renilla (Promega) luciferase plasmids using Effectene transfection reagent. Luciferase activity was estimated using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) at Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies). All samples were assayed in duplicate. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA using random hexamer primers and a RevertAid™ First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit (Fermentas). 1/20 of cDNA mixture was combined with primers (0.25 μm), fluorescein (1:105; Bio-Rad) and components of the SensiMix DNA kit (Quantace) according to the manufacture's instructions and amplified in the iCycler (Bio-Rad). The following iCycler protocol was used: denaturation (95 °C for 10 min), amplification and quantification (40 cycles: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 60 s), melting curve program (72-95 °C; 0.5 °C/s), and cooling to 22 °C. Primers 5′-TACTGAGCCTGCCATCTGTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCTCCACAAACTGCTGCTGTG-3′ (reverse) and primers 5′-AAGATGACTCAGATCATGTTCGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGGGCGATGATCTTGATCTTCAT-3′ (reverse) were used for amplification of β-catenin and β-actin fragment, respectively. Serial dilutions of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV gene cloned into a pCRR2.1-TOPO vector and primers 5′-GATGCTACAGCTGACAGTCGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGTGACCATGTGACCCACTG-3′(reverse) served for generation of a calibration curve. Preparation of Cell Lysates, Fractions, and Immunoprecipitation—Whole cell extracts were prepared with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm K2HPO4, 0.5% Nonidet P40, 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm Na2MoO4, 20 mm NaF, 0.1 mm PMSF, 20 mm β-glycerol-2-phosphate, 10 mm Na4P2O7). Aliquots of the lysates were boiled with sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) for 5 min. Subcellular fractions of MDCK were prepared with ProteoExtract kit (Calbiochem) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoprecipitation, the lysates were incubated with appropriate antibodies for 4 h to overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were trapped on protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), washed, boiled in the sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting. Pulse-Chase Assay—Cells were washed and incubated in the pulse medium (methionine/cysteine-free RPMI 1640 (Sigma), 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 0.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen)) for 1 h. The cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine using the Amersham Biosciences Redivue Pro-Mix Cell Labeling Mix, 0.05 mCi (with respect to l-[35S]methionine) per 1 ml of pulse medium for 1 h. Labeled cells were washed twice with pulse medium and chased in complete RPMI 1640, 0.5% fetal calf serum for 2-8 h, after which β-catenin was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates. Immunocomplexes were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE; the gels were incubated in Amplify Fluorographic Reagent (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to film. A part of the samples was subjected to Western blotting. Western Blotting—The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to Immobilon-P transfer polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), and stained with specific antibodies as described (29Sokolova O. Heppel N. Jägerhuber R. Kim K.S. Frosch M. Eigenthaler M. Schubert-Unkmeir A. Cell. Microbiol. 2004; 6: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Immunoreactivity was detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit ECL™ (Amersham Biosciences). The protein bands on x-ray films were scanned by using VersaDoc Imaging System (Bio-Rad) and analyzed using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). By applying several software functions, the Quantity One software allows subtraction of the background from the images. The data from three independent experiments were used for the calculations of the results. Immunofluorescence—Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min, permeabilized, and blocked in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% goat serum (Sigma) for 30 min on ice. Then the cells were incubated with the first antibody for 2 h at room temperature (RT), washed, and exposed for indocarbocyanine-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova) for 1 h at RT. Slides were analyzed by Leica DMRE 7 fluorescence microscope. Statistical Analysis—The statistical analysis of the results was done using Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. H. pylori Induces LEF/TCF Transactivation and Regulates Cyclin D1 Expression—To investigate whether H. pylori controls LEF/TCF activity, non-tumor epithelial MDCK cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmid containing either three copies of wild type (TOPflash) or mutated (FOPflash) LEF/TCF binding sites and infected with H. pylori. At different periods of time, cells were collected, and luciferase activity was measured. The firefly luciferase activity was normalized relative to renilla luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 1A, H. pylori regulates luciferase activity within 24 h post-infection (1.7-fold compared with FOPflash). LiCl, a known activator of β-catenin signaling (30Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. LEF/TCF transcription factors are known to bind to cyclin D1 promoter and regulate gene expression (20Shtutman M. Zhurinsky J. Simcha I. Albanese C. D'Amico M. Pestell R. Ben-Ze'ev A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5522-5527Crossref PubMed Scopus (1914) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the ability of the bacteria to regulate cyclin D1. We found an approximate 2.1 and 1.9-fold increase of cyclin D1 mRNA in MDCK cells infected with H. pylori for 10 and 24 h, respectively (data not shown). To investigate protein levels of cyclin D1, cytosolic and nuclear fractions of MDCK cells were subjected to Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, infection with H. pylori led to an increase of cyclin D1 in the cytosol of the cells. A similar effect on cyclin D1 expression was achieved in MDCK cells by treatment with LiCl (10 μm, 24 h). Thus, H. pylori stimulates β-catenin-dependent LEF/TCF transactivation activity and causes an increase of cyclin D1 level in MDCK cells. H. pylori Inhibits Ser/Thr Phosphorylation of β-Catenin—Studying phosphorylation status and localization of β-catenin in H. pylori-infected cells, fluorescence microscopy revealed that Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41-phosphorylated β-catenin was localized at cell-cell contacts and in nuclei of non-stimulated cells. Total β-catenin was detected at cell-cell contacts (Fig. 2A). Ser/Thr-phosphorylated β-catenin was prominently removed from adherens junctions, and cytosolic staining of β-catenin increased at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2A). We failed to see any changes of β-catenin amount in H. pylori-infected cells in comparison to non-infected MDCK cells in a Western blot analysis of subcellular fractions (Fig. 2B). We observed a prominent decrease of Ser/Thr-phosphorylated β-catenin in membranes/organelles and nuclear fractions of cells infected with H. pylori for 24 h (Fig. 2B). Heat-inactivated H. pylori had no effect on β-catenin phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). Thus, physical interaction of living bacteria with the host cell is requested for β-catenin regulation. Decrease of β-catenin phosphorylation in H. pylori-infected MDCK cells was detected at 6 h and more prominently at 8 h post-infection (Fig. 2C). Treatment of MDCK cells with LiCl provoked similar suppression of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin (supplemental Fig. S1). Regulation of β-Catenin Phosphorylation in H. pylori Infection is CagA-independent—The H. pylori type 4 secretion system (T4SS) serves for delivery of CagA and other yet unknown bacterial effectors into epithelial cells (31Naumann M. Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2005; 295: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). CagA is effectively translocated into MDCK cells, similar to gastric AGS cells, where it becomes phosphorylated at tyrosine residues (Fig. 3A). To investigate the role of CagA and the functional T4SS in H. pylori-induced changes of β-catenin signaling, we infected MDCK cells with H. pylori P1 isogenic mutants lacking cagA or virB7 for 24 h. Compared with the H. pylori wt, cagA and virB7 mutants also inhibited β-catenin phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). H. pylori Suppresses Ser/Thr Phosphorylation of β-Catenin in a GSK3β-dependent Manner—Ser-33, Ser-37, and Thr-41 of β-catenin are known target sites for GSK3β which phosphorylates and thereby marks the protein for ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation (32Behrens J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 910: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, decrease of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in the β-catenin protein can be caused either by GSK3β inhibition or by degradation of β-catenin. Because the total amount of β-catenin in infected cells was not affected (Figs. 2B and 3B), we supposed that GSK3β inhibition could be responsible for the suppression of β-catenin phosphorylation. GSK3β activity is negatively regulated through its phosphorylation at Ser-9 by Akt kinase (33Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4373) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of different cellular fractions revealed an induction of GSK3β Ser-9 phosphorylation by the wt strain of H. pylori and slightly less prominently by cagA and virB7 mutant strains (Fig. 4A). GSK3β was detected in nuclear fractions; this could be a consequence of partial serum deprivation during the experiments, as has been described (34Bijur G.N. Jope R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37436-37442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To investigate whether CagA is involved in the regulation of β-catenin phosphorylation, we transiently transfected MDCK cells with a plasmid encoding CagA. As shown in Fig. 4B, neither GSK3β nor β-catenin phosphorylations were affected in MDCK cells transfected with the plasmid encoding CagA. Therefore, H. pylori inhibits GSK3β in a CagA-independent manner, which leads to inhibition of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin in infected cells. GSK3β is known to be regulated upon Akt kinase (35Doble B.W. Woodgett J.R. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1763) Google Scholar). To investigate up-stream regulators and to confirm that GSK3β plays a role in H. pylori-induced suppression of β-catenin phosphorylation, we infected cells in the presence of Akti-1/2, an allosteric inhibitor of Akt1 and Akt2 isozymes. This substance promotes the formation of an inactive conformation of Akt in a pleckstrin homology-dependent manner and selectively inhibits phosphorylation and kinase activity (36Barnett S.F. DeFeo-Jones D. Fu S. Hancock P.J. Haskell K.M. Jones R.E. Kahana J.A. Kral A.M. Leander K. Lee L.L. Malinowski J. McAvoy E.M. Nahas D.D. Robinson R.G. Huber H.E. Biochem. J. 2005; 385: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The inhibitor does not exhibit any effect on protein kinases A and C even at concentration as high as 50 μm. In MDCK cells, Akti-1/2 (2 μm) blocked effectively Ser-473 phosphorylation of Akt kinase induced by H. pylori (Fig. 5A) and prevented bacteria-induced suppression of Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin (Fig. 3B). Viability of H. pylori was not affected by inhibitor treatment (data not shown). Stimulation of Akt kinase activity by H. pylori has been also observed in AGS cells (28Churin Y. Al-Ghoul L. Kepp O. Meyer T.F. Birchmeier W. Naumann M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). AGS cells infected with H. pylori also exert suppression of β-catenin phosphorylation, and Akti-1/2 was able to restore β-catenin phosphorylation (data not shown). To unravel putative upstream components that could direct Akt activation, we pretreated the cells before infection with the following inhibitors: LY294002 (20 μm), an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); AG1478/AG828 (5 μm), an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and Her2/Neu receptors; PHA-665752 (0.2 μm), an inhibitor of c-Met receptor; U73122 (5 μm), an inhibitor of phospholipase C (Fig. 5A). Pretreatment of the cells with LY294002 (Fig. 5A) completely inhibited Akt phosphorylation induced by H. pylori P1 wt and isogenic mutants. Thus, we suggest that H. pylori induces T4SS-independent PI3K activity leading to Akt activation. PI3K activity can be induced by EGF receptor (EGFR) or c-Met, which become active in H. pylori infection (37Wallasch C. Crabtree J.E. Bevec D. Robinson P.A. Wagner H. Ullrich A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Churin Y. Al-Ghoul L. Kepp O. Meyer T.F. Birchmeier W. Naumann M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Inhibition of EGFR activity significantly reduced H. pylori-induced phosphorylation of Akt, whereas inhibition of c-Met had no effect on phosphorylation of Akt kinase (Fig. 5A). EGFR activation in gastric epithelial cells was shown to be stimulated by H. pylori in a T4SS-independent manner (37Wallasch C. Crabtree J.E. Bevec D. Robinson P.A. Wagner H. Ullrich A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 695-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Thus, our results allow us to suppose that EGFR activation could contribute to Akt phosphorylation induced by H. pylori in a T4SS-independent manner. Inhibition of PLC had no effect on Akt phosphorylation in H. pylori-infected cells (Fig. 5A). To confirm the data obtained by using Akt kinase inhibitor, Akt depletion with siRNA was performed. At 48 h of transfection, the amount of Akt in MDCK cell lysates was significantly decreased (Fig. 5B). As shown in Fig. 5C, anti-Akt siRNA prevented inhibitory GSK3β phosphorylation, leading to β-catenin phosphorylation in MDCK cells infected with H. pylori. Therefore, Akt kinase, an upstream modulator of GSK3β, is causally related to regulation of β-catenin signaling in H. pylori-infected cells. Interestingly, besides restoration of the β-catenin phosphorylation, Akti-1/2 inhibited LEF/TCF transactivation in H. pylori-infected cells (Fig. 5D). These data indicate the important role of Akt/GSK3β and Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin in the regulation of β-catenin nuclear activity during H. pylori infection. H. pylori Affects Ubiquitinylation of β-Catenin—Because Ser/Thr phosphorylation of β-catenin has been shown to be essential for the protein ubiquitinylation (38Orford K. Crockett C. Jensen J.P. M Weissman A. Byers S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24735-24738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar), we investigated whether H. pylori affects this process. MDCK cells were infected in the presence of the 26 S proteasome inhibitor MG132 (20 μm), and the lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a β-catenin-specific antibody. Western blot analysis revealed a reduction of the ubiquitin level in β-catenin immunoprecipitates from MDCK cells infected by H. pylori, with T4SS mutant being less effective (Fig. 6A). The same result was obtained by using N-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinyl-l-norleucinal (25 μm), another inhibitor of proteasomal degradation (data not shown). Ubiquitinylation is known to be a prerequisite for β-catenin degradation. Thus, we examined further stability of β-catenin by pulse-chase analysis after 10 h of co-culture with H. pylori. Infection of cells with wt or cagA and virB7 mutants led to delayed β-catenin degradation within the periods of time analyzed (Fig. 6B). Therefore, H. pylori regulates β-catenin signaling by suppression of β-catenin ubiquitinylation and degradation in MDCK cells, and this effect is CagA-independent. Interestingly, incorporation rate of [35S]methionine/cysteine during the pulse period was decreased in infected MDCK cells. We failed to observe significant changes in β-catenin gene expression at 10 and 24 h post-infection (Fig. 6C). Thus, the decreased incorporation could also reflect negative effect of H. pylori on β-catenin translation. β-Catenin has been studied intensively in relation to the colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers (39Chesire D.R. Isaacs W.B. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2003; 10: 537-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40Brabletz T. Hlubek F. Spaderna S. Schmalhofer O. Hiendlmeyer E. Jung A. Kirchner T.

Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 499-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). It becomes evident that alterations of expression and intracellular redistribution of β-catenin may be important for gastric cancer development as well (6Nabais S. Machado J.C. Lopes C. Seruca R.

https://openalex.org/W1985716934,"Anthrax lethal factor (LF) is a Zn+2-dependent metalloprotease that cleaves several MAPK kinases and is responsible for the lethality of anthrax lethal toxin (LT). We observed that a recombinant LF (LF-HMA) which differs from wild type LF (LF-A) by the addition of two residues (His-Met) to the native Ala (A) terminus as a result of cloning manipulations has 3-fold lower potency toward cultured cells and experimental animals. We hypothesized that the “N-end rule”, which relates the half-life of proteins in cells to the identity of their N-terminal residue, might be operative in the case of LF, so that the N-terminal residue of LF would determine the cytosolic stability and thereby the potency of LF. Mutational studies that replaced the native N-terminal residue of LF with known N-end rule stabilizing or destabilizing residues confirmed that the N-terminal residue plays a significant role in determining the potency of LT for cultured cells and experimental animals. The fact that a commercially-available LF preparation (LF-HMA) that is widely used in basic research studies and for evaluation of vaccines and therapeutics is 3-fold less potent than native LF (LF-A) should be considered when comparing published studies and in the design of future experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2070276978,"Copy number variants (CNVs) contribute significantly to human genomic variation, with over 5000 loci reported, covering more than 18% of the euchromatic human genome. Little is known, however, about the origin and stability of variants of different size and complexity. We investigated the breakpoints of 20 small, common deletions, representing a subset of those originally identified by array CGH, using Agilent microarrays, in 50 healthy French Caucasian subjects. By sequencing PCR products amplified using primers designed to span the deleted regions, we determined the exact size and genomic position of the deletions in all affected samples. For each deletion studied, all individuals carrying the deletion share identical upstream and downstream breakpoints at the sequence level, suggesting that the deletion event occurred just once and later became common in the population. This is supported by linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis, which has revealed that most of the deletions studied are in moderate to strong LD with surrounding SNPs, and have conserved long-range haplotypes. Analysis of the sequences flanking the deletion breakpoints revealed an enrichment of microhomology at the breakpoint junctions. More significantly, we found an enrichment of Alu repeat elements, the overwhelming majority of which intersected deletion breakpoints at their poly-A tails. We found no enrichment of LINE elements or segmental duplications, in contrast to other reports. Sequence analysis revealed enrichment of a conserved motif in the sequences surrounding the deletion breakpoints, although whether this motif has any mechanistic role in the formation of some deletions has yet to be determined. Considered together with existing information on more complex inherited variant regions, and reports of de novo variants associated with autism, these data support the presence of different subgroups of CNV in the genome which may have originated through different mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2022835736,"Glucocorticoids (GCs) play important roles in numerous cellular processes, including growth, development, homeostasis, inhibition of inflammation, and immunosuppression. Here we found that GC-treated human lung carcinoma A549 cells exhibited the enhanced formation of the thick stress fibers and focal adhesions, resulting in suppression of cell migration. In a screen for GC-responsive genes encoding actin-interacting proteins, we identified caldesmon (CaD), which is specifically up-regulated in response to GCs. CaD is a regulatory protein involved in actomyosin-based contraction and the stability of actin filaments. We further demonstrated that the up-regulation of CaD expression was controlled by glucocorticoid receptor (GR). An activated form of GR directly bound to the two glucocorticoid-response element-like sequences in the human CALD1 promoter and transactivated the CALD1 gene, thereby up-regulating the CaD protein. Forced expression of CaD, without GC treatment, also enhanced the formation of thick stress fibers and focal adhesions and suppressed cell migration. Conversely, depletion of CaD abrogated the GC-induced phenotypes. The results of this study suggest that the GR-dependent up-regulation of CaD plays a pivotal role in regulating cell migration via the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton."
https://openalex.org/W2072078891,"Mobile group II introns insert site-specifically into DNA target sites by a mechanism termed retrohoming in which the excised intron RNA reverse splices into a DNA strand and is reverse transcribed by the intron-encoded protein. Retrohoming is mediated by a ribonucleoprotein particle that contains the intron-encoded protein and excised intron RNA, with target specificity determined largely by base pairing of the intron RNA to the DNA target sequence. This feature enabled the development of mobile group II introns into bacterial gene targeting vectors (""targetrons"") with programmable target specificity. Thus far, however, efficient group II intron-based gene targeting reactions have not been demonstrated in eukaryotes.By using a plasmid-based Xenopus laevis oocyte microinjection assay, we show that group II intron RNPs can integrate efficiently into target DNAs in a eukaryotic nucleus, but the reaction is limited by low Mg(2+) concentrations. By supplying additional Mg(2+), site-specific integration occurs in up to 38% of plasmid target sites. The integration products isolated from X. laevis nuclei are sensitive to restriction enzymes specific for double-stranded DNA, indicating second-strand synthesis via host enzymes. We also show that group II intron RNPs containing either lariat or linear intron RNA can introduce a double-strand break into a plasmid target site, thereby stimulating homologous recombination with a co-transformed DNA fragment at frequencies up to 4.8% of target sites. Chromatinization of the target DNA inhibits both types of targeting reactions, presumably by impeding RNP access. However, by using similar RNP microinjection methods, we show efficient Mg(2+)-dependent group II intron integration into plasmid target sites in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and into plasmid and chromosomal target sites in Drosophila melanogster embryos, indicating that DNA replication can mitigate effects of chromatinization.Our results provide an experimental foundation for the development of group II intron-based gene targeting methods for higher organisms."
https://openalex.org/W1963711379,"The transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) and the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), two important components of the MHC-I antigen presentation pathway, are often deficient in tumor cells. The restoration of their expression has been shown to restore the antigenicity and immunogenicity of tumor cells. However, it is unclear whether TAP and MHC-I expression in tumor cells can affect the induction phase of the T cell response. To address this issue, we expressed viral antigens in tumors that are either deficient or proficient in TAP and MHC-I expression. The relative efficiency of direct immunization or immunization through cross-presentation in promoting adaptive T cell responses was compared. The results demonstrated that stimulation of animals with TAP and MHC-I proficient tumor cells generated antigen specific T cells with greater killing activities than those of TAP and MHC-I deficient tumor cells. This discrepancy was traced to differences in the ability of dendritic cells (DCs) to access and sample different antigen reservoirs in TAP and MHC-I proficient versus deficient cells and thereby stimulate adaptive immune responses through the process of cross-presentation. In addition, our data suggest that the increased activity of T cells is caused by the enhanced DC uptake and utilization of MHC-I/peptide complexes from the proficient cells as an additional source of processed antigen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that immune-escape and metastasis are promoted in the absence of this DC 'arming' mechanism. Physiologically, this novel form of DC antigen sampling resembles trogocytosis, and acts to enhance T cell priming and increase the efficacy of adaptive immune responses against tumors and infectious pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2036272854,"Transcription of the rearranged immunoglobulin gene and expression of the enzyme activation-induced deaminase (AID) are essential for somatic hypermutations of this gene during antibody maturation. While AID acts as a single-strand DNA-cytosine deaminase creating U . G mispairs that lead to mutations, the role played by transcription in this process is less clear. We have used in vitro transcription of the kan gene by the T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) in the presence of AID and a genetic reversion assay for kanamycin-resistance to investigate the causes of multiple clustered mutations (MCMs) during somatic hypermutations. We find that, depending on transcription conditions, AID can cause single-base substitutions or MCMs. When wild-type RNAP is used for transcription at physiologically relevant concentrations of ribonucleoside triphosphates (NTPs), few MCMs are found. In contrast, slowing the rate of elongation by reducing the NTP concentration or using a mutant RNAP increases several-fold the percent of revertants containing MCMs. Arresting the elongation complexes by a quick removal of NTPs leads to formation of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops). Treatment of these structures with AID results in a high percentage of Kan(R) revertants with MCMs. Furthermore, selecting for transcription elongation complexes stalled near the codon that suffers mutations during acquisition of kanamycin-resistance results in an overwhelming majority of revertants with MCMs. These results show that if RNAP II pauses or stalls during transcription of immunoglobulin gene, AID is likely to promote MCMs. As changes in physiological conditions such as occurrence of certain DNA primary or secondary structures or DNA adducts are known to cause transcriptional pausing and stalling in mammalian cells, this process may cause MCMs during somatic hypermutation."
https://openalex.org/W2046377521,"Endothelial inflammation with chemokine involvement contributes to acute coronary syndromes (ACS). We tested the hypothesis that variation in the chemokine gene CXCL5, which encodes epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (ENA-78), is associated with ACS prognosis. We also investigated whether statin use, a potent modulator of inflammation, modifies CXCL5's association with outcomes and characterized the in vitro effect of atorvastatin on endothelial ENA-78 production. Using a prospective cohort of ACS patients (n = 704) the association of the CXCL5 −156 G>C polymorphism (rs352046) with 3-year all-cause mortality was estimated with hazard ratios (HR). Models were stratified by genotype and race. To characterize the influence of statins on this association, a statin*genotype interaction was tested. To validate ENA-78 as a statin target in inflammation typical of ACS, endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with IL-1β and atorvastatin with subsequent quantification of CXCL5 expression and ENA-78 protein concentrations. C/C genotype was associated with a 2.7-fold increase in 3-year all-cause mortality compared to G/G+G/C (95%CI 1.19–5.87; p = 0.017). Statins significantly reduced mortality in G/G individuals only (58% relative risk reduction; p = 0.0009). In HUVECs, atorvastatin dose-dependently decreased IL-1β-stimulated ENA-78 concentrations (p<0.0001). Drug effects persisted over 48 hours (p<0.01). CXCL5 genotype is associated with outcomes after ACS with potential statin modification of this effect. Atorvastatin lowered endothelial ENA-78 production during inflammation typical of ACS. These findings implicate CXCL5/ENA-78 in ACS and the statin response."
https://openalex.org/W2061360320,"Amplification of the oncogene MYCN in double minutes (DMs) is a common finding in neuroblastoma (NB). Because DMs lack centromeric sequences it has been unclear how NB cells retain and amplify extrachromosomal MYCN copies during tumour development.We show that MYCN-carrying DMs in NB cells translocate from the nuclear interior to the periphery of the condensing chromatin at transition from interphase to prophase and are preferentially located adjacent to the telomere repeat sequences of the chromosomes throughout cell division. However, DM segregation was not affected by disruption of the telosome nucleoprotein complex and DMs readily migrated from human to murine chromatin in human/mouse cell hybrids, indicating that they do not bind to specific positional elements in human chromosomes. Scoring DM copy-numbers in ana/telophase cells revealed that DM segregation could be closely approximated by a binomial random distribution. Colony-forming assay demonstrated a strong growth-advantage for NB cells with high DM (MYCN) copy-numbers, compared to NB cells with lower copy-numbers. In fact, the overall distribution of DMs in growing NB cell populations could be readily reproduced by a mathematical model assuming binomial segregation at cell division combined with a proliferative advantage for cells with high DM copy-numbers.Binomial segregation at cell division explains the high degree of MYCN copy-number variability in NB. Our findings also provide a proof-of-principle for oncogene amplification through creation of genetic diversity by random events followed by Darwinian selection."
https://openalex.org/W2095720053,"Relaxin peptides are important hormones for the regulation of reproductive tissue remodeling and the renal cardiovascular system during pregnancy. Recent studies demonstrated that two of the seven human relaxin family peptides, relaxin H2 (RLN2) and INSL3, signal exclusively through leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors, LGR7 and LGR8. Although it was well characterized that an RXXXRXXI motif at the RLN2 B chain confers receptor activation activity, it is not clear what roles RLN2 A chain plays in receptor interaction. Analyses of relaxin family genes on syntenic regions of model tetrapods showed that the A chain of RLN2 orthologs exhibited a greater sequence divergence as compared with the receptor-binding domain-containing B chain, foreshadowing a potential role in receptor interactions; hence, defining receptor selectivity in this fast evolving peptide hormone. To test our hypothesis that select residues in the human RLN2 A chain play key roles in receptor interaction, we studied mutant peptides with residue substitution(s) in the A chain. Here, we showed that alanine substitution at the A16 and A17 positions enhances LGR8-activation activity of RLN2, whereas mutation at the A22-23 region (RLN2A22-23) ablates LGR8, but not LGR7, activation activity. In addition, we demonstrated that the functional characteristics of the RLN2A22-23 mutant are mainly attributed to modifications at the PheA23 position. Taken together, our studies indicated that ThrA16, LysA17, and PheA23 constitute part of the receptor-binding interface of human RLN2, and that modification of these residues has led to the generation of novel human RLN2 analogs that would allow selective activation of human LGR7, but not LGR8, in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2124426609,"Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance and dependence remain elusive. We investigated roles of EphB receptor tyrosine kinases--which play important roles in synaptic connection and plasticity during development and in the matured nervous system--in development and maintenance of physical dependence on morphine in the mouse spinal cord (SC). Spinal administration of an EphB receptor blocking reagent EphB2-Fc prevents and/or suppresses behavioral responses to morphine withdrawal and associated induction of c-Fos and depletion of calcitonin gene-related peptide. Western blotting and immunohistochemical fluorescence staining demonstrates that EphB1 receptor protein is significantly up-regulated in the spinal dorsal horn following escalating morphine treatment. Chronic morphine exposure and withdrawal significantly increased phosphorylation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit NR2B as well as the activated forms of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and the cAMP response element binding protein in SC. The increased levels of phosphorylation of these molecules, however, are significantly inhibited by the EphB receptor blocker. These findings indicate that EphB receptor signaling, probably by interacting with NR2B in SC, contributes to the development of opioid physical dependence and withdrawal effects. This novel role for EphB receptor signaling suggests that these molecules may be useful therapeutic targets for preventing, minimizing, or reversing the development of opiate dependence."
https://openalex.org/W2015879028,"Background The quantitative end-point for many behavioral tests of nociception is the reaction time, i.e. the time lapse between the beginning of the application of a stimulus, e.g. heat, and the evoked response. Since it is technically impossible to heat the skin instantaneously by conventional means, the question of the significance of the reaction time to radiant heat remains open. We developed a theoretical framework, a related experimental paradigm and a model to analyze in psychophysical terms the “tail-flick” responses of rats to random variations of noxious radiant heat. Methodology/Principal Findings A CO2 laser was used to avoid the drawbacks associated with standard methods of thermal stimulation. Heating of the skin was recorded with an infrared camera and was stopped by the reaction of the animal. For the first time, we define and determine two key descriptors of the behavioral response, namely the behavioral threshold (Tβ) and the behavioral latency (Lβ). By employing more than one site of stimulation, the paradigm allows determination of the conduction velocity of the peripheral fibers that trigger the response (V) and an estimation of the latency (Ld) of the central decision-making process. Ld (∼130 ms) is unaffected by ambient or skin temperature changes that affect the behavioral threshold (∼42.2–44.9°C in the 20–30°C range), behavioral latency (<500 ms), and the conduction velocity of the peripheral fibers that trigger the response (∼0.35–0.76 m/s in the 20–30°C range). We propose a simple model that is verified experimentally and that computes the variations in the so-called “tail-flick latency” (TFL) caused by changes in either the power of the radiant heat source, the initial temperature of the skin, or the site of stimulation along the tail. Conclusions/Significance This approach enables the behavioral determinations of latent psychophysical (Tβ, Lβ, Ld) and neurophysiological (V) variables that have been previously inaccessible with conventional methods. Such an approach satisfies the repeated requests for improving nociceptive tests and offers a potentially heuristic progress for studying nociceptive behavior on more firm physiological and psychophysical grounds. The validity of using a reaction time of a behavioral response to an increasing heat stimulus as a “pain index” is challenged. This is illustrated by the predicted temperature-dependent variations of the behavioral TFL elicited by spontaneous variations of the temperature of the tail for thermoregulation."
https://openalex.org/W1989465053,"The xanthine oxidoreductase gene (XOR) encodes an important source of reactive oxygen species and uric acid, and its expression is associated with various human diseases including several forms of cancer. We previously reported that basal human XOR (hXOR) expression is restricted or repressed by E-box and TATA-like elements and a cluster of transcriptional proteins, including AREB6-like proteins and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). We now demonstrate that the cluster contains the tumor suppressors SAFB1, BRG1, and SAF-A. We further demonstrate that SAFB1 silencing increases hXOR expression and that SAFB1 directly binds to the E-box. Multiple studies in vitro and in vivo including pulldown, immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicate that SAFB1, Ku86, and BRG1 associate with each other. The results suggest that the SAFB1 complex binds to the hXOR promoter in a chromatin environment and plays a critical role in restricting hXOR expression via its direct interaction with the E-box, DNA-PK, and tumor suppressors. Moreover, we demonstrate that the cytokine, oncostatin M (OSM), induces the phosphorylation of SAFB1 and that the OSM-induced hXOR mRNA expression is significantly inhibited by silencing the DNA-PK catalytic subunit or SAFB1 expression. The present studies for the first time demonstrate that hXOR is a tumor suppressor-targeted gene and that the phosphorylation of SAFB1 is regulated by OSM, providing a molecular basis for understanding the role of SAFB1-regulated hXOR transcription in cytokine stimulation and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2085639329,Goodpasture-antigen binding protein (GPBP) is a nonconventional Ser/Thr kinase for basement membrane type IV collagen. Various studies have questioned these findings and proposed that GPBP serves as transporter of ceramide between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Here we show that cells expressed at least two GPBP isoforms resulting from canonical (77-kDa) and noncanonical (91-kDa) mRNA translation initiation. The 77-kDa polypeptide interacted with type IV collagen and localized as a soluble form in the extracellular compartment. The 91-kDa polypeptide and its derived 120-kDa polypeptide associated with cellular membranes and regulated the extracellular levels of the 77-kDa polypeptide. A short motif containing two phenylalanines in an acidic tract and the 26-residue Ser-rich region were required for efficient 77-kDa polypeptide secretion. Removal of the 26-residue Ser-rich region by alternative exon splicing rendered the protein cytosolic and sensitive to the reduction of sphingomyelin cellular levels. These and previous data implicate GPBPs in a multicompartmental program for protein secretion (i.e. type IV collagen) that includes: 1) phosphorylation and regulation of protein molecular/supramolecular organization and 2) interorganelle ceramide trafficking and regulation of protein cargo transport to the plasma membrane.

Class-I myosins, single-headed myosins with globular tails, are widely expressed in a variety of organisms, including yeast, amoebas, and humans. The head domains of class-I myosins are highly homologous to other myosins, but their tail domains are unique. The head domains of all class-I myosins that have been tested bind F-actin, express actin-activated Mg-ATPase activity, and, with the neck domains, function as an actin-dependent motor. Their tail domains can be divided into two categories: short and long.

NMR data and homology modeling indicate that the putative PH domain of AMIC has the required β-strands (Fig. 1) but not the α-helix.

In this study, we initially asked if AMIC binds PIP2 with higher affinity than it binds other acidic phospholipids, if binding to phospholipids is affected by interactions between the basic region and SH3 domain of AMIC, and if the putative PH domain in the basic region is important for the binding of AMIC to acidic phospholipids. In contrast to related studies, we used full-length as well as truncated myosin. We found that the apparent interactions between the putative PH domain and the SH3 domain revealed by NMR do not affect the affinity of AMIC for acidic phospholipids and that AMIC does not bind preferentially to phospholipid vesicles containing PIP2 relative to vesicles containing PS when normalized to net negative charge. Consistent with this conclusion, the mutation of an Arg to Ala that blocks the binding of mouse MYO1C to PIP2 (18Hokanson D.E. Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol.

However, we identified a 13-residue basic-hydrophobic-basic sequence in the putative PH domain that may be important for binding AMIC to acidic phospholipid vesicles. Importantly, we found that, despite its lack of stereospecificity for PIP2, AMIC concentrates at PIP2-enriched regions of the plasma membrane in situ (most likely because of the high concentration of negative charges) at sites of cell protrusion (e.g. pseudopods and phagocytic and pinocytic cups).

The R779A mutant DNA of FL-AMIC was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis performed by Mutagenex Inc. (Piscataway, NJ) using FL-AMIC DNA as starting material. Purified proteins were dialyzed against myosin I storage buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 50% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol) and stored at -20 °C. Phospholipid Vesicles—All phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL): 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (PC) (catalog number 850375C), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (PS) (catalog number 840035C), 1-oleoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (catalog number 810133), brain PIP2 (catalog number 840046x), and PIP3 (catalog number 850156x). Lipids (in chloroform and/or methanol) were mixed in appropriate proportions and dried sequentially for 30 min under N2, 30 min under vacuum, and again for 30 min under N2. Dried lipids were resuspended in 1.5 ml of 10 mm imidazole and 0.18 m sucrose to a final concentration of total lipid of 5 mm. The mixture was vortexed for 1 min and sonicated in a bath sonicator for 5 min, repeated three times. The lipids were then passed once through an extruder fitted with two 100-nm membranes. Vesicles were frozen in liquid N2 and thawed five times and passed through an extruder seven times. The final vesicles contained PC with varied molar percentages of PS, PIP2, or PIP3 and 1% 1-oleoyl-2-[12-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]dodecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.

Binding Assay—Proteins (40-100 nm) and vesicles were mixed together in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EGTA containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin to block nonspecific binding. The mixture was centrifuged for 40 min at 200,000 × g. Aliquots of the supernatants were removed, and the amount of unbound FL-AMIC or T4 was determined by measuring K-ATPase activity (28Lynch T.J. Brzeska H. Baines I.C. Korn E.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Vesicle concentration and pelleted vesicles were monitored by fluorescence. The K50 values (concentration of phospholipid required to bind 50% of FL-AMIC or T4) were calculated from assays in which the concentration of the protein was constant and the concentration of phospholipid varied. The values compared in each figure and in the table were obtained with the same batch of phospholipids and with proteins that were purified in parallel and had the same K-ATPase activity. Although absolute values varied up to 2.5-fold when different batches of vesicles or proteins with lower K-ATPase activity were used, the ratios of the K50 values of FL-AMIC and T4 were the same in all experiments. K50 is equivalent to Kd when, as in these experiments, the phospholipid concentration is greatly in excess of the protein ligand. Synthetic Peptides and Peptide Competition Assay—Peptides were synthesized and purified by EZbiolab (Westfield, IN). The peptide competition assays were performed with an excess of lipid over protein (i.e. when 100% of protein (T4) was bound). The peptide was then added at increasing concentrations, and the amount of T4 released from the vesicles was measured by K-ATPase activity, as described above for the binding assay. IC50 is the concentration of peptide required to release 50% of bound T4. The K50 for peptide binding, which can be compared with the K50 for T4, was calculated, assuming that peptide and T4 bind to the same sites (composed of one or more phospholipids) on the vesicles, by adaptation of the equation developed by Nikolovska-Coleska et al. (29Niklovska-Coleska Z. Wang R. Fang X. Pan H. Tomita Y. Li P. Roller P.P. Krajewski K. Saito N.G. Stuckey J.A. Wang S. Anal.

We substituted T4 for L, PS or PIP2 for P, peptide for I, K50(T4) for Kd, and K50(peptide) for Ki and solved for Ki using the on-line Ki calculator (52Wang G. Nikolovska-Coleska Z. Yang C.Y. Wang R.

Microscopy Procedures—Amoebae were routinely grown in rotating (140 rpm) Erlenmeyer flasks at 30 °C in medium containing 1.5% (w/v) proteose peptone, 1.5% (w/v) glucose, 0.2 mm methionine, 3 mm KH2PO4, 10 μm CaCl2, 1 μm FeCl3, 0.1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mg/liter thiamine, 0.02 mg/liter biotin, and 1 μg/liter cyanocobalamin. Rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for AMIC (1:75 dilution) (22Baines I.C. Brzeska H. Korn E.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and two different antibodies for PIP2, mouse monoclonal (2C11) IgM antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (1:50 dilution) and mouse monoclonal IgG antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) (dilution 1:150), were used. The results were similar for the two anti-PIP2 antibodies, but the Abcam antibody produced brighter, broader, and more continuous fluorescently stained regions. F-actin was detected by staining with fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Fluorescently labeled phalloidin and secondary goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Alexa-Fluoro 633, Alexa-Fluoro 488 and Alexa-Fluoro 594) were from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Fluorescently labeled (fluorescein isothiocyanate or rhodamine) anti-mouse IgM antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For immunolocalization microscopy, amoebae were grown on 22-mm diameter, collagen-coated coverslips (BD Biocoat, Bedford, MA) placed in 6-well plates or collagen-coated 8-well cell culture slides (BD Biocoat). Amoebae from rotating cultures were diluted to 2-3 × 106 cells/ml, and 2-3 ml of diluted cells were placed in each well and left at 30 °C for 2 h or overnight. The cells were incubated in fresh medium for about 10 min and moved to room temperature, and the medium was replaced with fixing solution (1% glutaraldehyde plus 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline) for 40 min. This was followed (as described earlier) (30Brzeska H. Szczepanowska J. Matsumura F. Korn E.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 2004; 58: 186-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by three 5-min washes with blocking buffer (10% fetal bovine serum, 0.02% NaN3 in phosphate-buffered saline), a 1-h incubation with the first antibody in blocking buffer with the addition of 0.2% saponin, three 5-min washes with blocking buffer, a 1-h incubation with the second antibody in blocking buffer with 0.2% saponin, three 5-min washes with blocking buffer, and one rinse with phosphate-buffered saline. For phagocytosis experiments, yeasts grown in shaking cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline to final A600 = 0.6, diluted 10-fold in amoeba growth medium, and added to amoebae grown overnight on coverslips (2-3 ml/well) after removal of old medium. Cells were incubated for 40 min and fixed and stained as described above. For membrane staining, fixation, and antibody staining, procedures were as described above, except the fixation time was reduced to 30 min, and incubation with secondary antibodies was in the absence of saponin. Amoebae were incubated for 15 min with concanavalin A conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 or CM-DiI (Molecular Probes), diluted 1:150, for 15 min, either before or after the amoebae were fixed and stained with antibodies with similar results. CM-DiI (1:200 dilution) was incubated with fixed amoebae for 20 min. Cells were viewed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a ×63 plan-Achromat 1.4 lens, and slice thickness of 1 μm. We first studied the binding of AMIC to acidic phospholipids in vitro. FL-AMIC (Fig. 1) and AMIC heavy chain truncated after the basic region (T4; Fig. 1), both with N-terminal FLAG tags, were co-expressed with AMIC light chain (25Wang Z.Y. Wang F. Sellers J.R.

T4 contains the entire basic region but not GPA1, GPA2, or the SH3 domain that, as indicated by NMR data (10Hwang K.-J. Mahmoodian F. Ferretti J.A. Korn E.D. Gruschus J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), interacts with the basic region of FL-AMIC. The myosin constructs were mixed with large unilamellar phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and at different concentrations, and the fraction of bound myosin was calculated from the K-ATPase activity remaining in the supernatant when the vesicles were pelleted (see “Materials and Methods” for experimental details). FL-AMIC and T4 Bind with the Same Affinity to Acidic Phospholipid Vesicles—The lipid concentration dependences of the binding of FL-AMIC and T4 to vesicles containing either 75% PS or 5% PIP2 (with neutral PC accounting for the remainder of the phospholipid) are shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The K50 values (total lipid) were 1.8 μm for FL-AMIC and 2.2 μm for T4 binding to 75% PS vesicles, and 42 μm for binding of both FL-AMIC and T4 to 5% PIP2 vesicles (Table 1). Although their binding affinities varied with the composition and concentration of the phospholipid vesicles, FL-AMIC and T4 always had similar affinities for vesicles of the same composition and concentration (Table 1). Therefore, at least under the conditions of these experiments, neither the folding of the FL-AMIC tail, shown by cryoelectron microscopy, nor the interaction between the SH3 domain and the basic region, indicated by NMR spectroscopy, affected the binding of AMIC to acidic phospholipid vesicles.TABLE 1Affinities of FL-AMIC and T4 for acidic phospholipid vesiclesLipidMyosinK50 of total lipidK50 of accessible lipidK50 of accessible acidic lipidμmμmμm15% PST4>4000>2000>30025% PSFL-AMIC844210.5T4904511.150% PSFL-AMIC4.02.01.0T45.02.51.375% PSFL-AMIC1.80.90.7T42.21.10.85% PIP2FL-AMIC42211.1T442211.13.6% PIP3FL-AMIC111562.0T465331.25% PIP2 + 25% PSFL-AMIC5.72.9NAT48.34.2NA10% PIP2 + 25% PSFL-AMIC6.83.4NAT47.63.8NA3.6% PIP3 + 25% PSFL-AMIC8.44.2NAT45.82.9NA Open table in a new tab Comparison of Binding to PIP2 and PS—At low content of acidic phospholipids, PIP2 vesicles were much better binding partners of both FL-AMIC and T4 than were PS vesicles. For example, the K50(total lipid) for binding to T4 was 42 μm for 5% PIP2 vesicles compared with >4,000 μm for 15% PS vesicles (Table 1). Increasing the PS content, however, greatly improved binding, and the K50 value for binding of T4 to 25% PS vesicles was 90 μm (Table 1). Interestingly, doubling the PS content from 25 to 50% increased the affinity of T4 binding by more than 10-fold (Fig. 2C), from K50 of 90 μm to 5 μm (Fig. 2C and Table 1, total lipid), but further increase of the PS content to 75% had a much smaller effect (K50 ∼ 2 μm, Table 1). The addition of 5% PIP2 to 25% PS vesicles had a similar effect as doubling the PS content (Fig. 2C and Table 1). These results suggest that strong binding of AMIC to PS vesicles requires a minimum charge density and that a molecule of AMIC may bind to more than one PS head group. The dependence of binding on the content of acidic phospholipid and the equivalence of the affinities for PIP2 and PS vesicles, when normalized for net negative charge, -1 for PS and -4 for PIP2 (31McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), are well illustrated in the experiments shown in Fig. 3, in which the total phospholipid concentration was kept constant and the phospholipid composition was varied. The lower curve in Fig. 3A shows that vesicles containing 5-15% PS had essentially the same low affinity for FL-AMIC with an increase in binding when the PS content was increased to 75%. The importance of charge density is supported by the affinity of FL-AMIC with vesicles containing 1-10% PIP2 in addition to 25% PS (Fig. 3A, upper curve). Although the addition of PIP2 to 25% PS vesicles caused a much greater increase in affinity than an equal molar percent increase in PS concentration (Fig. 3A, lower curve), this difference can be fully explained by the higher negative charge of PIP2. Corrected for the 4-fold difference in negative charge between PIP2 and PS (31McLaughlin S. Wang J. Gambhir A. Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), the two curves are essentially identical (Fig. 3B). In agreement with this, the K50 for binding of FL-AMIC and T4 to vesicles containing 5% PIP2 plus 25% PS was the same as for vesicles containing 50% PS and more than 10 times higher than for vesicles containing only 25% PS (Table 1). The last result implies that in vivo AMIC may preferentially bind to regions of membranes enriched in PIP2 (see below). When calculated on the basis of accessible acidic phospholipid, the K50 for binding of 5% PIP2 vesicles to both FL-AMIC and T4 was 1 μm (Table 1, acidic lipid only), which is a typical affinity for proteins with a PIP2-specific PH domain (15Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Abrams C.S. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 17Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, as discussed above, vesicles containing 50% PS and no PIP2 bound to FL-AMIC and T4 with the same high affinity, indicative of a lack of phospholipid head group specificity for the binding of AMIC to acidic phospholipids. The high affinity for PS is unusual for PH-domains (although binding of PH domains to PS has not been studied in great detail). Also, and in contrast to mouse MYO1C (17Hokanson D.E. Ostap E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3118-3123Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and other proteins with PH domain-specific binding (14Kavran J.M. Klein D.E. Lee A. Falasca M. Isakoff S.J.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), the K50 values for binding of FL-AMIC and T4 to PIP3 vesicles (with or without PS) were similar to the K50 values for binding to PIP2 vesicles (Table 1). Is the Putative PH Domain of AMIC Important for Binding?—Binding of T4 to 30% PS vesicles was not inhibited by the addition of the soluble head groups d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and d-myo-inositol 1,3,5-trisphosphate at concentrations as high as 200 μm (data not shown). Other soluble phosphoinositols, d-myo-inositol 1-phosphate, d-myo-inositol 1,3,4-trisphosphate, and d-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentaphosphate at concentrations of 50-100 μm, also had no effect (data not shown). Thus, binding of AMIC to phospholipids does not show behavior typical of PIP2- or PIP3-specific PH domains. Although PH domains generally have low sequence homology, several highly conserved basic residues are required for high affinity binding of PH domain proteins to PIP2 vesicles (34Cronin T.C. DiNitto J.P. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3711-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, mutation of Arg903 in mouse MYO1C to Ala decreased the affinity of MYO1C for PIP2 by ≫8-fold (18Hokanson D.E. Laakso J.M. Lin T. Sept D. Ostap E.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4856-4865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We found that the homologous mutation of FL-AMIC, R779A, caused only a 2-4-fold reduction in the binding of T4 to 50% PS vesicles (Fig. 4) or to 5% PIP2 plus 25% PS vesicles (not shown). Although this may be a greater decrease in affinity than would be expected from the decrease in net positive charge of the basic region (from +15 to +14), it is a much smaller decrease than expected for a PIP2-specific PH domain (34Cronin T.C. DiNitto J.P. Czech M.P. Lambright D.G. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 3711-3720Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, although Arg779 may contribute to the binding specificity of AMIC, it is not a major determinant, and this region of the putative PH domain most likely does not play a major role in binding of FL-AMIC to acidi"

Esophageal stenting, as part of a palliative therapy management has dramatically improved the quality of live of EGC patients. Airway stenting is generally proposed in case of esophageal stent complication, with a high failure rate. The study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of scheduled and non-scheduled airway stenting in case of indicated esophageal stenting for EGC.The study is an observational study conducted in pulmonary and gastroenterology endoscopy units. Consecutive patients with EGC were referred to endoscopy units. We analyzed the outcome of airway stenting in patients with esophageal stent indication admitted in emergency or with a scheduled intervention. Forty-four patients (58+/-\-8 years of age) with esophageal stenting indication were investigated. Seven patients (group 1) were admitted in emergency due to esophageal stent complication in the airway (4 fistulas, 3 cases with malignant infiltration and compression). Airway stenting failed for 5 patients. Thirty-seven remaining patients had a scheduled stenting procedure (group 2): stent was inserted for 13 patients with tracheal or bronchial malignant infiltration, 12 patients with fistulas, and 12 patients with airway extrinsic compression (preventive indication). Stenting the airway was well tolerated. Life-threatening complications were related to group 1. Overall mean survival was 26+/-10 weeks and was significantly shorter in group 1 (6+/-7.6 weeks) than in group 2 (28+/-11 weeks), p<0.001). Scheduled double stenting significantly improved symptoms (95% at day 7) with a low complication rate (13%), and achieved a specific cancer treatment (84%) in most cases.Stenting the airway should always be considered in case of esophageal stent indication. A multidisciplinary approach with initial airway evaluation improved prognosis and decreased airways complications related to esophageal stent. Emergency procedures were rarely efficient in our experience."
https://openalex.org/W2052665704,"γ2-Adaptin is a putative member of the clathrin adaptor protein family with unknown physiological function. We previously reported that γ2-adaptin acts as a ubiquitin receptor by virtue of its ubiquitin-interacting motif. Here we demonstrate that this motif mediates a specific physical interaction with the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and promotes ubiquitination of γ2-adaptin. By mapping regions of Nedd4 involved in binding to γ2-adaptin, we identified its C2 domain to be essential, whereas the WW and HECT domains are dispensable. Consistent with this, we uncovered that the C2 domain of Nedd4 is ubiquitinated itself and as such is recruited by the ubiquitin-interacting motif of γ2-adaptin for subsequent ubiquitin conjugation. Unlike known coupled ubiquitination reactions, this novel type of interaction leads to mono- and multi/polyubiquitinated γ2-adaptin. In addition, we show that γ2-adaptin functions in the endosomal/multivesicular body (MVB) pathway. Depletion of γ2-adaptin impairs the degradation of internalized epidermal growth factor and results in defective MVB morphology characterized by significantly enlarged vesicles. These defects cannot be rescued by γ1-adaptin, a closely related homolog of γ2-adaptin, which is unable to bind ubiquitin. Together, these results indicate that γ2-adaptin may operate within the MVB sorting system in a manner different from that of classic adaptins."
https://openalex.org/W4243375767,"Background Over many years, it has been assumed that enzymes work either in an isolated way, or organized in small catalytic groups. Several studies performed using “metabolic networks models” are helping to understand the degree of functional complexity that characterizes enzymatic dynamic systems. In a previous work, we used “dissipative metabolic networks” (DMNs) to show that enzymes can present a self-organized global functional structure, in which several sets of enzymes are always in an active state, whereas the rest of molecular catalytic sets exhibit dynamics of on-off changing states. We suggested that this kind of global metabolic dynamics might be a genuine and universal functional configuration of the cellular metabolic structure, common to all living cells. Later, a different group has shown experimentally that this kind of functional structure does, indeed, exist in several microorganisms. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have analyzed around 2.500.000 different DMNs in order to investigate the underlying mechanism of this dynamic global configuration. The numerical analyses that we have performed show that this global configuration is an emergent property inherent to the cellular metabolic dynamics. Concretely, we have found that the existence of a high number of enzymatic subsystems belonging to the DMNs is the fundamental element for the spontaneous emergence of a functional reactive structure characterized by a metabolic core formed by several sets of enzymes always in an active state. Conclusions/Significance This self-organized dynamic structure seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of metabolism, common to all living cellular organisms. To better understand cellular functionality, it will be crucial to structurally characterize these enzymatic self-organized global structures."
https://openalex.org/W1973602610,"Most G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form di(oligo)-meric structures that constitute signaling and trafficking units and might be essential for receptor functions. Cell responses to complement C5a receptor (C5aR) are tightly controlled by receptor desensitization and internalization. To examine the implication of dimerization in C5aR regulation, we generated an NH(2)-terminally modified C5aR mutant, unable to bind C5a, and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant. Neither an intact NH(2) terminus nor the presence of COOH-terminal phosphorylation sites appeared to be required for the formation of C5aR dimers. Upon C5a stimulation, mutant receptors did not internalize when individually expressed. C5a stimulation of cells that co-expressed wild type C5aR together with either unliganded or phosphorylation-deficient mutant resulted in co-internalization of mutant receptors with C5aR. Unliganded GPCRs can be cross-phosphorylated within a heterologous receptor dimer or by second messenger-activated kinases. C5a stimulation of (32)P-labeled cells that co-expressed the unliganded mutant with either C5aR or the phosphorylation-deficient mutant did not induce phosphorylation of the unliganded mutant. We can thus postulate that, in the case of C5aR, the stimulation and phosphorylation of one monomer is enough to lead to dimer internalization. The existence and functional implication of di(oligo)mer formation may be important for an accurate C5aR down-regulation in pathological conditions."

Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR)-associated factors (TRAFs) are a family of proteins that were identified initially as signaling adaptors of the TNFR superfamily members (7Rothe M. Wong S.C. Henzel W.J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1994; 78: 681-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). To date, seven members of the TRAF family have been identified (8Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 9Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 10Xu L.G.

Among TRAF family members, TRAF6 exhibits the unique property in that its TRAF-C domain interacts with a peptide motif distinct from that recognized by other TRAF members (11Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). More recently, TRAF6 has been shown to be involved in signaling by Toll/IL-1 receptor family members (12Kobayashi T. Walsh M.C.

Turka L.A. Choi Y. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in addition to TNFR superfamily members. The biological role of TRAF6 appears to be cell type-specific. TRAF6 is a T cell-intrinsic negative regulator required for the maintenance of immune homeostasis (19King C.G. Kobayashi T. Cejas P.J. Kim T. Yoon K. Kim G.K. Chiffoleau E. Hickman S.P. Walsh P.T. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In dendritic cells, TRAF6 is a critical positive regulator for dendritic cells maturation and development (20Kobayashi T. Walsh P.T. Walsh M.C. Speirs K.M. Chiffoleau E. King C.G. Hancock W.W. Caamano J.H. Hunter C.A. Scott P. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Immunity. 2003; 19: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). TRAF6 can either directly associate with cell surface receptors or function as an adaptor molecule in the intermediate level of a signaling cascade. TRAF6 directly associates with surface receptors such as CD40 or receptor activator of NF-κB (21Wu H. Arron J.R. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1096-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), IL-17 receptor (15Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), or IL-25 receptor (16Maezawa Y. Nakajima H. Suzuki K. Tamachi T. Ikeda K. Inoue J. Saito Y. Iwamoto I. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and functions at the top of a signaling cascade. In TLR and TCR signaling, TRAF6 functions at the intermediate level through interaction with other signaling molecules in the cytoplasm. The pathway of TLR-MyD88-IRAK4-TRAF6-TAK/TAB-IKK-NF-κB plays an essential role in TLR-mediated host defense against microbial infection (22Takeda K. Akira S. Semin. Immunol. 2004; 16: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1813) Google Scholar), whereas the pathway of TCR-PKC-Bcl10/MALT1-TRAF6-TAK/TAB-IKK-NF-κB regulates TCR-induced lymphocyte activation (18Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that TRAF6 plays an essential role in Toll/IL-1 receptor family-, TNFR family-, TCR-, IL-17-, or IL-25R-mediated signaling, whether it functions in FcϵRI-mediated signaling in mast cells has not been explored. In this study, we report that TRAF6 is an important positive regulator for FcϵRI-mediated signaling in mast cells. TRAF6 is specifically required for FcϵRI-mediated downstream signaling leading to activation of NF-κB and MAP kinase p38 and JNK and subsequent cytokine IL-6, CCL-9, IL-13, and TNF production. However, TRAF6 is not required for mast cell maturation, nor it is needed for FcϵRI-mediated phosphorylation of proximal signaling molecule LAT or MAP kinase ERK1/2 and subsequent degranulation or leukotriene production. Thus, TRAF6 segregates FcϵRI-induced cytokine production from mast cell degranulation and leukotriene production and represents a novel mechanism in FcϵRI-mediated mast cell activation. Antibodies—Antibodies to phospho-JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185), JNK, phospho-p38 MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phospho-p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2), p44/42 MAPK, phospho-c-Jun (Ser-73), phospho-IκB-α (Ser 32), and IκB-α were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Antibodies to NF-κB p65, p38 MAPK, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, TRAF6 (H-274), and actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse CD117 (c-kit) monoclonal Ab (IgG2a, CL8936F), and FITC-rat IgG2a (CLCR2A01) were purchased from Cedarlane Laboratories Ltd. (Hornby, Ontario, Canada). FITC-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgE (IgG1) and FITC-rat IgG1 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 594-conjugated IgG F(ab′)2 was purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA). Mast Cells—TRAF6-deficient mice were generated as described previously (23Naito A. Azuma S. Tanaka S. Miyazaki T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The mouse liver-derived mast cells were obtained by culturing liver cells from the newborn mice (1-2 days) of TRAF6+/- colony. Briefly, liver tissue was removed to a sterile environment and was ground to produce a single cell suspension in RPMI 1640 medium. Cells were collected, centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium (RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS, 10% WEHI-3B conditioned medium, 30 ng/ml stem cell factor, 50 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 200 nm prostaglandin E2). An aliquot of cells from each mouse was used for genotyping. Nonadherent cells were resuspended in complete medium twice per week and transferred to a fresh flask once per week. After 5-6 weeks, mast cell purity of >98% was achieved as assessed by toluidine blue staining of fixed cytocentrifuge preparations. Mast cells were passively sensitized with IgE from TIB-141 cells (ATCC number TIB-141) (24Rudolph A.K. Burrows P.D. Wabl M.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1981; 11: 527-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and then activated by the addition of 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA (Biosearch Technologies, Inc., Novato, CA) or 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 (Sigma). Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer for analysis of whole cell lysates. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies and secondary antibodies and then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Mast Cell Degranulation—Mast cell degranulation was determined by measuring β-hexosaminidase activities. Real Time Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR were performed as described previously (25Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as an endogenous reference. Data were analyzed using relative standard curve method according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase Assay for NF-κB Activities—Liver mast cells (4 × 106) were co-transfected with pNF-κB-Luc plasmid (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and RL-TK plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) using Amaxa mouse T cell nucleofector kit (VPA-1006) in the Amaxa nucleofector device (program U-023, Gaithersburg, MD). After transfection, mast cells were allowed to recover for 24 h. Cells were then sensitized with anti-TNP IgE and challenged with TNP-BSA for 5 h. Firefly and Renilla activities were sequentially quantified using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) in a Veritas microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed by using the ChIP-IT kit (catalog number 53009, Active Motif), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. In brief, mast cells (1 × 107 cells/condition) were left unstimulated or stimulated for 20 min, 1 h, or 2 h with 10 ng/ml TNP-BSA. Cells were then fixed for 5 min at room temperature with 1% formaldehyde. To shear genomic DNA, the nuclei were subjected to an enzymatic digestion with 5 units of enzymatic shearing mixture solution (Active Motif) for 25 min at 37 °C. Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated with 4 μg of anti-NF-κB p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Ab or control IgG (Active Motif). Then 0.4% of the input DNA and 5% of the precipitated DNA were used as templates for each PCR consisting of 36 cycles of 20 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 59 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. PCR products were separated by 2% PAGE. Primers employed are as follows: CCL-9 forward, 5′-GGC CAG AGC TAA AGG AGT GA-3′, and CCL-9 reverse, 5′-GGC CCG GTC TTG CTA TTT AT-3′, 244 bp; TNF forward, 5′-GGG CTG AGT TCA TTC CCT CT-3′, and TNF reverse, 5′-CTT CTG AAA GCT GGG TGC AT-3′, 192 bp. Immunofluorescence Study—Staining was carried out as described previously (25Li B. Power M.R. Lin T.J. Blood. 2006; 107: 2814-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Mast cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with anti-TRAF6 Ab and followed by Alexa 594-goat anti-rabbit IgG as a secondary Ab. Cell nucleus were visualized by 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining. Intracellular Calcium—Mast cells were incubated for 30 min with 2 μm Fura-2 AM. After washing, mast cells were resuspended in phosphate buffer with 1.5 mm CaCl2 at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Fluorescence was measured by placing 2 ml of the mast cell suspension in a 37 °C thermostated quartz cuvette with magnetic stirring in a RF-1501 spectrofluorophotometer (Shimadzu Co., Tokyo, Japan). Detection of Cytokine and Leukotriene C4 Production—IL-6, CCL-9, IL-13, TNF, and leukotriene C4 were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instruction. Cytokine Protein Array—Mast cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of TNP-BSA for 6 h. Supernatants were collected and analyzed with the RayBio™ Mouse Inflammation Antibody Array I (catalog no. M0329801, Raybiotech, Norcross, GA), which can detect 40 different cytokines. The assay was performed in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Mast Cells Mature Normally in Vitro by Culturing Cells from Mouse Neonatal Liver in the Absence of TRAF6—TRAF6 has been shown to be essential for dendritic cell maturation and development (20Kobayashi T. Walsh P.T. Walsh M.C. Speirs K.M. Chiffoleau E. King C.G. Hancock W.W. Caamano J.H. Hunter C.A. Scott P. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Immunity. 2003; 19: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and T cell homeostasis (19King C.G. Kobayashi T. Cejas P.J. Kim T. Yoon K. Kim G.K. Chiffoleau E. Hickman S.P. Walsh P.T. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). We found that mast cells also express TRAF6 (Fig. 1A). Immunofluorescence staining indicated that resting mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells express TRAF6, which appears to be in a punctated pattern. Stimulation with TNP-BSA appears to induce TRAF6 distribution more evenly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A). These data suggest that TRAF6 may be involved in FcϵRI-induced mast cell activation. Accordingly, we decided to determine whether TRAF6 plays a role in mast cell development and IgE-dependent activation. First, we tested if TRAF6 is required for mast cell development. Because TRAF6-deficient mice die prematurely and show severe osteopetrosis (23Naito A. Azuma S. Tanaka S. Miyazaki T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), it is not feasible to use the traditional approach of culturing mast cells from bone marrow cells. Instead, livers from the newborn mice in the TRAF6+/- breeding colony were used to culture mast cells. TRAF6-deficient, wild type, or heterozygote mice were identified by genotyping (Fig. 1B). Each individual experiment was performed using mast cells derived from the same litter animals. Liver cells were cultured in SCF and IL-3 containing media for 4-8 weeks and examined by metachromatic staining and flow cytometry. No morphological difference can be observed between TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells by toluidine blue staining (Fig. 1C). TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells express similar levels of IgE receptor and c-kit (Fig. 1, D and E). To test mast cell function, calcium ionophore A23187 was used to induce mast cell degranulation. Similar levels of β-hexosaminidase release were seen in TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells following A23187 stimulation (Fig. 1F), suggesting that mast cell degranulation machinery is intact in TRAF6-deficient cells. Thus, TRAF6 deficiency does not affect mast cell maturation and degranulation machinery. TRAF6 Deficiency Leads to Impaired IgE-dependent IL-6, CCL-9, IL-13, and TNF Production, but Not Leukotriene Production—In TLR- or CD40-mediated signaling events, TRAF6 plays an essential role in NF-κB-regulated gene expression. To examine whether TRAF6 plays a role in FcϵRI aggregation-mediated mast cell activation, TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells were sensitized with IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA for 6 h. Cell-free supernatants were analyzed by protein array assay. Among the 40 cytokines and chemokines tested, IL-6, CCL-9, and TNF showed visible diminished expression in TRAF6-deficient cells following TNP-BSA stimulation (supplemental Fig. 1). We performed ELISA and real time quantitative PCR to further determine IL-6 and CCL-9 expression. TNP-BSA-induced IL-6 production at the protein level was reduced in TRAF6-deficient mast cells compared with wild type mast cells (Fig. 2A). The impaired production of IL-6 was persistent throughout the time course examined (3-24 h). TNP-induced IL-6 mRNA expression, which peaked at 1 h, was reduced by 44% in TRAF6-deficient mast cells (Fig. 2, B and C). In contrast, liver-derived TRAF6+/- mast cells produced similar levels of IL-6 in response to TNP-BSA stimulation as compared with wild type mast cells (data not shown). Similarly, TNP-BSA-induced CCL-9 expression at protein and mRNA levels was reduced in TRAF6-deficient cells (Fig. 2, D, E, and F). In addition, decreased IL-13 and TNF production was confirmed by ELISA (Fig. 2, G and H). These results indicated that TRAF6 plays a positive role in FcϵRI-induced signaling and contributes to FcϵRI-mediated production of IL-6, CCL-9, IL-13, and TNF. It is important to note that unlike the complete inhibition of TLR-induced IL-6 and TNF production in TRAF6-deficient macrophages (26Gohda J. Matsumura T. Inoue J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2913-2917Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), TRAF6 deficiency only partially blocked FcϵRI-induced IL-6, CCL-9, TNF, and IL-13 production. These data suggested a differential role of TRAF6 in TLR- and FcϵRI-mediated signaling. To examine whether TRAF6 is required for IgE-dependent lipid mediator production, TRAF6-deficient mast cells and wild type cells from the same litter were stimulated by TNP-BSA for 20 min. Cell supernatants were used to examine LTC4 production. No difference in LTC4 production was observed between TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells (Fig. 2I). Thus, TRAF6 selectively affects IgE-dependent cytokine IL-6, CCL-9, IL-13, and TNF production but not leukotriene production. TRAF6 Deficiency Leads to Impaired IgE-dependent IκB-NF-κB Pathway Activation—NF-κB plays a central role in the regulation of IgE-dependent mast cell cytokine production. To examine whether TRAF6 is required for IgE-dependent NF-κB pathway activation, TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells after sensitization with IgE were transfected with NF-κB luciferase plasmid and stimulated with TNP-BSA. Significant TNP-induced NF-κB activation was seen in wild type mast cells as expected. However, TNP-induced NF-κB activity was severely impaired in TRAF6-deficient mast cells (Fig. 3A). To confirm a role for TRAF6 in NF-κB activation, nuclei from mast cells following stimulation by TNP-BSA for various times were analyzed by ChIP assay using anti-NF-κB p65 Ab. Immunoprecipitates were subjected to PCR analysis using primers targeting the promoter regions of CCL-9 and TNF genes. Reduced PCR products for CCL-9 and TNF promoters were seen in TRAF6-deficient cells compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3B). Western blotting using nuclear proteins was performed to further confirm NF-κB p65 activation. TNP-BSA stimulation induced nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 in wild type mast cells. TRAF6-deficient mast cells showed impaired p65 nuclear translocation (Fig. 3C). We further determined IκB phosphorylation and degradation. Rapid and significant IκB phosphorylation was observed in wild type mast cells following TNP-BSA stimulation. Phosphorylation was accompanied by degradation of total IκB (5-20 min) and was followed by regeneration of IκB protein (1-6 h) in these cells (Fig. 3D). In contrast, TRAF6-deficient mast cells showed severely impaired IκB phosphorylation. Compared with the rapid phosphorylation (5 min) in wild type mast cells, little TNP-induced phosphorylation was seen at 5 min in TRAF6-deficient cells. Similarly, little TNP-induced phosphorylation was seen in the later time points (60 and 180 min) compared with the prominent phosphorylation seen in wild type mast cells at these time points (60 and 180 min) (Fig. 3D). These results suggest an essential role for TRAF6 in IgE-dependent IκB-NF-κB pathway activation. IκB generation appears to be less dependent on TRAF6 because TNP-induced increase of total IκB was discernible in TRAF6-deficient cells. In T cells, TRAF6 relays signals from TCR to NF-κB through association with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (Malt1) and B cell lymphoma 10 (Bcl10) (18Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). We tested whether TRAF6 associates with Malt1 in mast cells. Mast cells derived from wild type mice with or without TNP-BSA stimulation were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-TRAF6 Ab. Immunoprecipitates were then probed for Malt1 or TRAF6 by Western blotting. No association of TRAF6 and Malt1 could be observed (supplemental Fig. 2). TRAF6 Deficiency Leads to Impaired IgE-dependent Phosphorylation of JNK and p38 but Not ERK—MAP kinase cascade plays a critical role in the regulation of mast cell function. MAP kinases JNK, p38, and ERK are activated by FcϵRI aggregation and play distinct roles in the regulation of IgE-dependent mediator secretion. To examine whether TRAF6 has a regulatory role in IgE-dependent MAP kinase activation, TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells were sensitized with IgE and stimulated with TNP-BSA for various times. Total cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for phospho-JNK, phospho-p38, phospho-ERK, and their respective total proteins. A severe defect of TNP-BSA-induced JNK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A, top band of JNK2) was observed in TRAF6-deficient mast cells, suggesting a critical role of TRAF6 in IgE-dependent JNK activation (Fig. 4, A and B). Similarly, a significant reduction in TNP-BSA-induced p38 phosphorylation was found in TRAF6-deficient mast cells (Fig. 4, C and D). In contrast, similar levels of TNP-BSA-induced ERK phosphorylation were seen in TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells (Fig. 4, E and F), suggesting a lack of effect of TRAF6 in IgE-dependent activation of the ERK pathway. ERK pathway is responsible for leukotriene production. Thus, the lack of effect of TRAF6 on ERK1/2 activation is consistent with the result showing no effect of TRAF6 on leukotrine C4 production. Thus, TRAF6 is specifically required for IgE-dependent activation of JNK and p38 but not ERK. The effect of TRAF6 on JNK phosphorylation prompted us to examine Jun family members. TNP-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun was reduced in TRAF6-deficient mast cells (Fig. 4, G and H). However, TNP-induced expression of c-Fos, c-Jun, and JunB at the mRNA level was comparable between wild type and TRAF6-deficient mast cells (supplemental Fig. 3). These results suggest that TRAF6 may be selectively involved in JNK phosphorylation but not gene expression of these family members. Effects of TRAF6 Deficiency on IgE-mediated Proximal Signaling Events—TRAF6 has been shown to be an adaptor that can directly bind to a cell surface receptor, such as CD40 (12Kobayashi T. Walsh M.C. Choi Y. Microbes Infect. 2004; 6: 1333-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 14Lomaga M.A. Yeh W.C. Sarosi I. Duncan G.S. Furlonger C. Ho A. Morony S. Capparelli C. Van G.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1015-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar), IL-17 (15Schwandner R. Yamaguchi K. Cao Z. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1233-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), or IL-25 (16Maezawa Y. Nakajima H. Suzuki K. Tamachi T. Ikeda K. Inoue J. Saito Y. Iwamoto I. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), in addition to functioning at a downstream level. No association between TRAF6 and FcϵRI or Lyn was observed in our co-immunoprecipitation experiment (data not shown). To test if FcϵRI-induced proximal signaling events are affected by TRAF6 deficiency, LAT phosphorylation was examined. Our results indicated that similar levels of LAT phosphorylation were observed in TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, it is likely that TRAF6 regulates FcϵRI-induced signaling downstream of LAT. TRAF6 Deficiency Has No Effects on IgE-dependent Calcium Mobilization and Degranulation—To examine whether TRAF6 regulates calcium mobilization, mast cells were loaded with Fura-2AM and stimulated with TNP-BSA. TNP-mediated calcium mobilization was intact in TRAF6-deficient mast cells (Fig. 5C). Similarly, TRAF6+/- mast cells also showed normal calcium mobilization in response to TNP-BSA stimulation (data not shown). To examine whether TRAF6 is required for IgE-dependent mast cell degranulation, TRAF6-deficient mast cells and wild type cells from the same litter were stimulated by TNP-BSA for 20 min. Cell supernatants were used to examine β-hexosaminidase release. No difference in β-hexosaminidase release was observed between TRAF6-deficient and wild type mast cells (Fig. 5D). Thus, TRAF6 selectively affects IgE-dependent cytokine IL-6, CCL-9, IL-13, and TNF production but not degranulation or leukotriene production (Fig. 5E). In this study we established a new approach to generate mature TRAF6-deficient mast cells. TRAF6-deficient mice show severe osteopetrosis and die within days after birth (23Naito A. Azuma S. Tanaka S. Miyazaki T. Takaki S. Takatsu K. Nakao K. Nakamura K. Katsuki M. Yamamoto T. Inoue J. Genes Cells. 1999; 4: 353-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not feasible to culture mast cells from bone marrow cells or to obtain sufficient tissue mast cells. Accordingly, we used liver cells from the newborn mice in the TRAF6+/- breeding colony and cultured these cells in the presence of SCF and IL-3 for differentiation into mast cells. This allows us to obtain TRAF6-/-, TRAF6+/-, and TRAF6+/+ mast cells from the same litter of mice. By using these cells, we provide evidence that TRAF6 has a novel role in FcϵRI-mediated signaling in mast cells. TRAF6 deficiency selectively affects FcϵRI-induced activation of NF-κB, MAP kinase p38, and JNK but has no effect on ERK or proximal molecule LAT phosphorylation, leading to the selective regulation of cytokine production but not degranulation or lipid mediator LTC4 production. Our results suggest a model of TRAF6 in FcϵRI-mediated signaling in mast cells (Fig. 5E). TRAF6 selectively functions downstream of LAT and upstream of NF-κB, MAP kinase p38, and JNK pathways that are responsible for gene expression of cytokines. TRAF6 is not involved in FcϵRI-mediated pathways leading to degranulation or lipid mediator production. FcϵRI aggregation initiates Lyn and Syk phosphorylation leading to LAT activation. LAT organizes a complex of signaling proteins containing Grb2, Gads, SLP-76, and phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) (5Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L. Love P.E. Rivera J. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 2000; 12: 525-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation study showed no association between TRAF6 and FcϵRI γ chain (data not shown). In addition, FcϵRI-induced LAT phosphorylation was not affected in TRAF6-deficient cells. These results suggested that TRAF likely functions downstream of LAT. Signals from FcϵRI branch out at LAT into several pathways (5Saitoh S. Arudchandran R. Manetz T.S. Zhang W. Sommers C.L.

Recruitment of Grb2 to LAT mediates activation of the Sos-Ras-Raf-MEK pathway leading to MAP kinase ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activation, which plays a primary role in IgE-dependent leukotriene production. No effect of TRAF6 deficiency on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and LTC4 production suggests that TRAF6 is not involved in this pathway activation. Although a role of TRAF6 in mediating CD40- or TLR-induced ERK activation has been shown in macrophages (27Eliopoulos A.G. Wang C.C. Dumitru C.D. Tsichlis P.N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3855-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), our result excluded a role of TRAF6 in FcϵRI-induced ERK activation in mast cells. Thus, TRAF6 has a distinct role in FcϵRI-mediated signaling in mast cells. Recruitment of Gads and SLP-76 to LAT is responsible for activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, leading to subsequent activation of MAP kinase JNK pathway MEKK1-SEK1/MKK7-JNK in mast cells (28Ishizuka T. Terada N. Gerwins P. Hamelmann E. Oshiba A. Fanger G.R. Johnson G.L. Gelfand E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6358-6363Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 29Kawakami Y. Hartman S.E. Holland P.M. Cooper J.A. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1795-1802PubMed Google Scholar). TRAF6 has been shown to directly associate with the MAP3K, MEKK1 (30Baud V. Liu Z.G. Bennett B. Suzuki N. Xia Y. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1297-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), and regulates JNK activity. TRAF6 deficiency dramatically blocked FcϵRI-induced JNK phosphorylation. Thus, it is likely that TRAF6 mediates FcϵRI-induced JNK activation through TRAF6-MEKK1-SEK1/MKK7-JNK pathway. FcϵRI aggregation induces MAP kinase p38 activation in mast cells through an unknown mechanism. However, TAK1-MKK6-p38 pathway has been well described in other immune effector cells (31Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1620) Google Scholar). TRAF6 deficiency significantly reduced FcϵRI-induced p38 phosphorylation. Given that a direct association between TRAF6 and TAK1 has been reported previously (32Takaesu G. Kishida S. Hiyama A. Yamaguchi K. Shibuya H. Irie K. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 649-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), it is possible that TRAF6 mediates FcϵRI-induced p38 activation through the TRAF6-TAK1-MKK6-p38 pathway. Recruitment of PLCγ to LAT leads to the subsequent activation of NF-κB, which is a master transcription factor that controls the expression of proinflammatory gene products (33Hayden M.S. Ghosh S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2195-2224Crossref PubMed Scopus (3339) Google Scholar). Binding of PLCγ to LAT induces generation of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and diacylglycerol, which are responsible for inducing calcium influx and protein kinase C (PKC) activation, respectively. We found that TRAF6 deficiency showed no effect on TNP-induced calcium mobilization, suggesting that TRAF6 functions downstream of calcium. In TCR-mediated signaling cascade, TRAF6 has been shown to be associated with Malt1/Bcl10 and to relay signals from TCR to IκB-NF-κB in T lymphocytes (18Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In mast cells, Malt1 and Bcl10 form a complex and link PKC to NF-κB activation through an unknown mechanism (34Klemm S. Gutermuth J. Hultner L. Sparwasser T. Behrendt H. Peschel C. Mak T.W. Jakob T. Ruland J. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Bcl10 or Malt1 deficiency induces diminished IgE-dependent NF-κB activation and cytokine production but normal degranulation, lipid mediator production, and mast cell maturation (34Klemm S. Gutermuth J. Hultner L. Sparwasser T. Behrendt H. Peschel C. Mak T.W. Jakob T. Ruland J. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), a pattern similar to that seen in TRAF6-deficient mast cells. Accordingly, we tested whether TRAF6 associates with Malt1 in mast cells. No physical association between TRAF6 and Malt1 was found in both TNP-stimulated and resting mast cells. It is noticeable that unlike Bcl10 or Malt1 deficiency, which leads to complete ablation of IgE-mediated TNF and IL-6 production (34Klemm S. Gutermuth J. Hultner L. Sparwasser T. Behrendt H. Peschel C. Mak T.W. Jakob T. Ruland J. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), TRAF6 deficiency only partially blocked IgE-mediated cytokine production. This is in contrast to the TCR signaling where TRAF6 is largely responsible for relaying Malt1/Bcl10 signals. Thus, unlike the linear Malt1-Bcl10-TRAF6-NF-κB pathway in TCR signaling, additional TRAF6-independent pathways are required for IgE-mediated cytokine production by mast cells. It is interesting to note that TRAF6 deficiency had no effect on mast cell development from liver cells under the culture condition containing IL-3 and SCF. This result suggests that TRAF6 is not required for IL-3- or SCF-mediated signaling in mast cells, although TRAF6 is needed for signaling several cytokine receptors in other cells (8Wajant H. Henkler F. Scheurich P. Cell. Signal. 2001; 13: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The lack of effect of TRAF6 in mast cell development is in vast contrast to the essential role of TRAF6 for the development of dendritic cells (20Kobayashi T. Walsh P.T. Walsh M.C. Speirs K.M. Chiffoleau E. King C.G. Hancock W.W. Caamano J.H. Hunter C.A. Scott P. Turka L.A. Choi Y. Immunity. 2003; 19: 353-363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) and plasma cells (35Ahonen C. Manning E. Erickson L.D. O'Connor B. Lind E.F. Pullen S.S. Kehry M.R. Noelle R.J. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These results support the concept that a role of TRAF6 in signal transduction is cell type-specific. Collectively, our results suggest that TRAF6 segregates FcϵRI-induced cytokine production from mast cell degranulation and leukotriene production. TRAF6 represents a novel mechanism in mediating FcϵRI-induced IκB/NF-κB, MAP kinase p38, and JNK but not ERK1/2 activation. These results implicate TRAF6 as a regulator in mast cell-mediated allergy inflammation.

However, the oligomeric structure of SecA and SecA conformational changes during translocation processes are still unclear. Here we obtained the three-dimensional structure of E. coli wild-type full-length SecA in solution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy and determined its oligomeric organization. In this structure, SecA occurs as a dimer in which the two protomers are arranged in an antiparallel mode, with a novel electrostatic interface, and both protomers are in closed conformation. The system developed here may provide a promising technique for studying dynamic structural changes in SecA."
https://openalex.org/W2165682680,"RNAs processing other RNAs is very general in eukaryotes, but is not clear to what extent it is ancestral to eukaryotes. Here we focus on pre-mRNA splicing, one of the most important RNA-processing mechanisms in eukaryotes. In most eukaryotes splicing is predominantly catalysed by the major spliceosome complex, which consists of five uridine-rich small nuclear RNAs (U-snRNAs) and over 200 proteins in humans. Three major spliceosomal introns have been found experimentally in Giardia; one Giardia U-snRNA (U5) and a number of spliceosomal proteins have also been identified. However, because of the low sequence similarity between the Giardia ncRNAs and those of other eukaryotes, the other U-snRNAs of Giardia had not been found. Using two computational methods, candidates for Giardia U1, U2, U4 and U6 snRNAs were identified in this study and shown by RT-PCR to be expressed. We found that identifying a U2 candidate helped identify U6 and U4 based on interactions between them. Secondary structural modelling of the Giardia U-snRNA candidates revealed typical features of eukaryotic U-snRNAs. We demonstrate a successful approach to combine computational and experimental methods to identify expected ncRNAs in a highly divergent protist genome. Our findings reinforce the conclusion that spliceosomal small-nuclear RNAs existed in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2002000813,"A prominent goal in gene therapy research concerns the development of gene transfer vehicles that can integrate exogenous DNA at specific chromosomal loci to prevent insertional oncogenesis and provide for long-term transgene expression. Adenovirus (Ad) vectors arguably represent the most efficient delivery systems of episomal DNA into eukaryotic cell nuclei. The most advanced recombinant Ads lack all adenoviral genes. This renders these so-called high-capacity (hc) Ad vectors less cytotoxic/immunogenic than those only deleted in early regions and creates space for the insertion of large/multiple transgenes. The versatility of hcAd vectors is been increased by capsid modifications to alter their tropism and by the incorporation into their genomes of sequences promoting chromosomal insertion of exogenous DNA. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) can insert its genome into a specific human locus designated AAVS1. Trans- and cis-acting elements needed for this reaction are the AAV Rep78/68 proteins and Rep78/68-binding sequences, respectively. Here, we describe the generation, characterization and testing of fiber-modified dual hcAd/AAV hybrid vectors (dHVs) containing both these elements. Due to the inhibitory effects of Rep78/68 on Ad-dependent DNA replication, we deployed a recombinase-inducible gene switch to repress Rep68 synthesis during vector rescue and propagation. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that rep68-positive dHVs can be produced similarly well as rep68-negative control vectors. Western blot experiments and immunofluorescence microscopy analyses demonstrated transfer of recombinase-dependent rep68 genes into target cells. Studies in HeLa cells and in the dystrophin-deficient myoblasts from a Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patient showed that induction of Rep68 synthesis in cells transduced with fiber-modified and rep68-positive dHVs leads to increased stable transduction levels and AAVS1-targeted integration of vector DNA. These results warrant further investigation especially considering the paucity of vector systems allowing permanent phenotypic correction of patient-own cell types with large DNA (e.g. recombinant full-length DMD genes)."
https://openalex.org/W2121594454,"Elevated intracellular cyclic AMP levels, which suppress the proliferation of naive T cells and type 1 T helper (Th1) cells are a property of T helper 2 (Th2) cells and regulatory T cells. While cyclic AMP signals interfere with the IL-2 promoter induction, they support the induction of Th2-type genes, in particular of il-5 gene. We show here that cyclic AMP signals support the generation of three inducible DNase I hypersensitive chromatin sites over the il-5 locus, including its promoter region. In addition, cyclic AMP signals enhance histone H3 acetylation at the IL-5 promoter and the concerted binding of GATA-3 and NFATc to the promoter. This is facilitated by direct protein-protein interactions involving the C-terminal Zn(2+)-finger of GATA-3 and the C-terminal region of the NFATc1 DNA binding domain. Because inhibition of NFATc binding to the IL-5 promoter in vivo also affects the binding of GATA-3, one may conclude that upon induction of Th2 effector cells NFATc recruits GATA-3 to Th2-type genes. These data demonstrate the functional importance of cyclic AMP signals for the interplay between GATA-3 and NFATc factors in the transcriptional control of lymphokine expression in Th2 effector cells."
https://openalex.org/W1998146578,"Translational read-through of the UGA stop codon is an evolutionarily conserved feature that most prominently represents the basis of selenoprotein biosynthesis. It requires a specific cis-acting stem loop control element, termed SECIS, which is located in the 3'-untranslated region of eukaryotic selenoprotein mRNAs. In a search for novel factors underlying the SECIS-directed UGA read-through process, we identified an evolutionary conserved GTPase-activating protein, termed GAPsec. We show that the activity of the Drosophila GAPsec (dGAPsec) is necessary to support SECIS-dependent UGA read-through activity in flies and the mouse homolog mGAPsec in mice tissue culture cells. However, selenoprotein biosynthesis is not impaired in flies that lack dGAPsec activity. The results indicate that GAPsec is part of a novel SECIS-dependent translational read-through system that does not involve selenocysteine incorporation."
https://openalex.org/W2064026835,"For a long period of time, the transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) has been thought to inhibit transcriptional activity for its ability to interact with CCAAT enhancer-binding protein family factors, thus preventing their binding to DNA. We have previously shown that in human T lymphocytes the CHOP phosphorylation induced by prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene expression. Given the CHOP positive role in the regulation of transcription, here we have investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which CHOP increases IL-8 gene activity under PGE2 stimulus. Transfection experiments with mutants showed both that the CHOP transactivation domain is essential for IL-8 transcription and that the IL-8/activator protein 1 (AP-1) promoter mutated in NF-κB and NF-IL-6, but not in the AP-1 site, harbors essential CHOP-responsive elements. CHOP silencing confirmed its role in the IL-8 transcriptional regulation and protein production, whereas c-Jun small interfering RNA experiments showed that the PGE2-induced activation of IL-8 promoter is mainly c-Jun-independent. Moreover, PGE2 induced CHOP-DNA complexes only when the entire IL-8/AP-1 promoter or the wild type sequences encompassing the AP-1 upstream region were employed. Mutations introduced in these sequences prevented the DNA-CHOP complex formation. The IL-8/AP-1 mutant promoter lacking the sequence immediately upstream the AP-1 site is PGE2-unresponsive. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation data confirmed in vivo that PGE2 induces CHOP binding to the IL-8 promoter. Taken together, our results suggest that the increased expression of CHOP in response to PGE2 exerts a positive transcriptional regulation of the IL-8 promoter mediated by direct binding to a novel consensus site.

More recently, the positive correlation between CHOP and IL-8 synthesis has been confirmed by experiments showing that the inhibition of CHOP repressed the NF-κB-mediated and proteasome-induced IL-8 activation (2Vij N. Fang S. Zeitlin P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17369-17378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). These results corroborated a positive role for CHOP in the induction of pro-inflammatory genes that was previously indicated on the IL-6 expression in melanoma cells, although with distinct mechanisms (3Hattori T. Itoh S. Hayashi H. Chiba T. Takii T. Yoshizaki K. Onozaki K. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2001; 21: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The activation of IL-6 transcription was dependent on the CHOP dimerization ability, given that a mutant lacking the leucine zipper domain exhibited a reduced effect on IL-6 promoter activity. CHOP was originally cloned as an inhibitory molecule of the C/EBP family transcriptional factors, to which it binds with its extreme C-terminal leucine zipper region, thus blocking the binding of C/EBPs to DNA (4Ron D. Habener J.F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar, 5Shirakawa K. Maeda S. Gotoh T. Hayashi M. Shinomiya K. Ehata S. Nishimura R. Mori M. Onozaki K. Hayashi H. Uematsu S. Akira S. Ogata E. Miyazono K. Imamura T. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 6105-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Afterward, it has been reported that CHOP can act as transcription factor inducing the gene expression by forming a heterodimer (6Zhao Q. Wang J. Levichkin I.V. Stasinopoulos S. Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that CHOP can interact with a variety of proteins in a different manner. The gain-of-function of CHOP induces its binding to several nuclear protein from erythroid cells, some of which are not C/EBP family members (7Cui K. Coutts M. Stahl J. Sytkowski. A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7591-7596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Sauter K. Grampp T. Fritschy J.M. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Mohler H. Benke D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33566-33572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that truncation of the N-terminal amino acids 1–42 (CHOPΔN) abolishes its co-localization with γ-aminobutyric acid type B1a receptor, indicating that CHOP may also interact with its N-terminal domain (8Sauter K. Grampp T. Fritschy J.M. Kaupmann K. Bettler B. Mohler H. Benke D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 33566-33572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a direct activity of CHOP as transcription factor was demonstrated by Ubeda et al. (9Ubeda M. Wang X.Z. Zinszner H. Wu I. Habener J.F. Ron D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1479-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who showed CHOP binding to a specific nucleotide sequence, which is similar to but distinct from the typical C/EBP-binding motif. Moreover, dose-dependent bidirectional effects of CHOP on the monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 promoter were shown in vascular smooth muscle cells (10Kodama K. Nishio Y. Sekine O. Sato Y. Egawa K. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Am. J. Physiol. 2005; 289: C582-C590Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Low expression of CHOP blocked the C/EBP binding to C/EBP-responsive elements, whereas increased expression directly stimulated the activity of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1. Thus, CHOP seems to exhibit different, and in some ways opposite, mechanisms in regulating gene expression and molecular interactions. In the present study, we addressed the molecular mechanism(s) by which CHOP increases the IL-8 gene expression following its activation by PGE2. Initially we investigated whether PGE2 induced CHOP expression in T cells; successively we demonstrated that CHOP is essential for PGE2-mediated IL-8 transcription, identifying the CHOP domains and the IL-8 promoter sites involved. Finally, a CHOP-responsive element (CHOP-RE) in the IL-8 promoter of human T lymphocytes stimulated by PGE2 was characterized.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Culture Conditions—Jurkat T cells (clone E6–1) were obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures (Sigma-Aldrich) and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in 95% air (37 °C) in RPMI 1640 (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone, Milan, Italy), and 20% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Euroclone, Milan, Italy). The cells were routinely tested for mycoplasma infection, and the cultures were renewed, from frozen stocks, every 2 months.RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcriptase—T cells were cultured in 35-mm well plates (5 × 106 cells/well) in the absence or presence of anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies (Immnunotech, Marseilles, France), and the cells were then immediately stimulated for the indicated times with 10–5 m PGE2. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20 μl with an IMProm-IITM reverse transcriptase kit (Promega, Milan, Italy) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Reverse Transcription PCR—20 μl of reverse transcription products were brought to a volume of 100 μl containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm PCR nucleotide mixture, a 1 μm concentration of both the upstream and downstream PCR primers (Sigma), 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Transgenomic, Inc., Bergamo, Italy), and 10× PCR buffer (Transgenomic, Inc.). Two pairs of primers were used in this study. The primer sequences were as follows: CHOP, 5′-CAGAACCAGCAGAGGTCACA-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCTGTGCCACTTTCCTTTC-3′ (antisense); and β-actin, 5′-TGACGGGGTCTACCCACACTGTGCCCCATCTA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTAGAAGCATTGCGCTGGACGATGGAGGG-3′ (antisense). Amplification was carried in a DNA thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Milan) after an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 4 min. This was followed by 35 cycles of PCR using the following temperature and time profile: denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer annealing for 1 min at 60 °C for CHOP and at 62 °C for β-actin, primer extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel in 1× buffer containing 89 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.3) after staining with 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The UV light-illuminated gels were photographed, and the relative sum intensity was calculated by normalizing the sum intensity of the CHOP product to the β-actin mRNA control.Quantitative Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using the ABI Prism 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). We used 5′-GCTTCTCTGGCTTGGCTGACT-3′ (Forward primer), 5′-CTGTTTCCGTTTCCTGGTTCTC-3′ (Reverse primer), and FAM-5′-CACTCTCCAGATTCCAGTCA-3′-MGBNFQ as primers and a TaqMan probe, respectively. Thermal cycling conditions included activation at 95 °C (10 min) followed by 40 cycles each of denaturation at 95 °C (15 s) and annealing/elongation at 55 °C (1 min). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate with β-actin (Applied Biosystems) as an the inner control, and the mean value of CHOP mRNA was calculated.The cycle threshold (Ct) was used to calculate relative amounts of target DNA. The Ct was determined as the number of PCR cycles required for a given reaction to reach an arbitrary fluorescence value within the linear amplification range.Plasmid Construction and Transient Transfections—Liposome-mediated transient gene transfer was carried out with DMRIE-C (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, the cells were seeded at 2 × 106 cells/well and transiently transfected with 1 μg of wt IL-8, IL-8 lacking the AP-1 site (IL-8–97), IL-8–97 mutant C/EBP (IL-8–97/mC/EBP), IL-8–97 mutant NF-κB (IL-8–97/mNF-κB), or IL-8 double mutant for C/EBP and NF-κB (IL-8/AP-1) promoter-driven luciferase reporter vectors developed in collaboration with Dr. Hector R. Wong (Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati OH); pSV-nlsLacZ DNA, a β-galactosidase expression vector (0.5 μg) and “empty” plasmid DNA (pBSM), at a final concentration of 2 μg/plate. pcDNA 3.1/V5 His expression plasmids for CHOP at a final concentration of 0.2 μg/plate were co-transfected where indicated. A mutant IL-8/AP-1 promoter construct (IL-8/AP-1ΔCHOP-RE) lacking the nucleotides GTGTGATG located upstream from the AP-1 was generated by PCR using forward primer 5′-TCCcccgggACTCAGGTTTGCCCTGAGGGGA and reverse primer 5′-CCGctcgagTGCCTTATGGAGTGCTCCGGTG. PCR conditions were 35 cycles at 94 °C for 45 s, 52 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR product was cloned as a SmaI/XhoI fragment into PGL2 basic vector (Promega). The constructs were sequenced before utilization.wt CHOP and CHOP mutants lacking the basic DNA-binding domain (CHOPΔBR) or the leucine zipper domain (CHOPΔLZ) or mutated into the p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation site (S79A,S82A) were kindly provided by Dr. Hidetoshi Hayashi (Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan). The CHOP mutant lacking either the DNA-binding or the leucine zipper domains and containing the sole transactivation domain (CHOPTA) was obtained by Stratagene (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). To create the dominant negative transactivation domain mutant CHOP (TAM-CHOP), the nucleotide sequences were amplified by PCR from the human genome using the forward primer 5′-ATGGGTACCTATGTTTCACCTCCTGG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCATGCTTGGTGCAGATTCACCATTC-3′. The PCR products were cloned into a pcDNA 3.1/V5 His expression vector (TOPO TA; Invitrogen). The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (CEQ 2000; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). wt c-Jun plasmid was provided by Lucia Altucci (Department of General Pathology, Second University of Naples, Naples, Italy).In all of the experiments, the transfections were stopped after 6 h by adding an equal volume of RPMI 1640 containing 20% fetal calf serum. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were treated with 10 μm PGE2 (Sigma, Milan, Italy). After an additional 6 h, the cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared for the luciferase activity using luciferine (Promega, Milan, Italy) as the substrate. Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity produced by co-transfected plasmid pnlsLAC.siRNA and Transfection—The siRNA sequence targeting CHOP mRNA corresponding to 5′-CAAUUGUUCAUGCUUGGUGUU-3′, the siRNA sequence targeting c-Jun mRNA corresponding to 5′-GGAUCAAGGCGGAGAGGAA-3′ and the nonspecific duplex corresponding to 5′-CAGUGGAGAUCAACGUGCAAGUU-3′ (ctr-siRNA) were obtained from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). Concentrations of siRNA and times of incubation were tested. Both CHOP and c-Jun siRNA knockdown reached the maximum at a concentration of 50 nm and at 48 h post-transfection. To assess gene silencing, the protein levels of CHOP and c-Jun were determined by immunoblotting. Jurkat T cells were plated in 35-mm well plates in RPMI 1640 medium without fetal bovine serum and co-transfected with double-stranded siRNA and wt IL-8 promoter (1 μg) using the DMRIE-C reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 h after the transfection, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies with PGE2 10 μm. After an additional 6 h, the cells were harvested, and protein extracts were prepared for the luciferase activity using luciferine (Promega, Milan, Italy) as the substrate. Luciferase activity was normalized for β-galactosidase activity produced by co-transfected plasmid pnlsLAC.Western Blot Analysis—The cells were cultured in 35-mm well plates at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/well. After stimulation, the cells were lysed at 4 °C in 150 μl of lysis buffer M-PER (Pierce) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mg/ml leupeptin. Where indicated, total extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells 36 h after transfection with wt or mutant pcDNA 3.1/V5 His CHOP expression plasmids.Western blotting was carried out as previously described (1Caristi S. Piraino G. Cucinotta M. Valenti A. Loddo S. Teti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14433-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). CHOP (Affinity BioReagents™) and c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) mouse monoclonal antibodies, diluted 1:500, and anti-V5 mouse monoclonal antibody, diluted 1:5000 (Invitrogen), have been employed, as described by the manufacturer. A mouse monoclonal 1:1000 diluted primary anti-β-actin antibody was used to normalize protein loading to that of specific proteins in each lane (Sigma-Aldrich Milan, Italy). After washings in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.3% Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. The proteins were visualized with reagents from Pierce (Super-signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate system).IL-8 Production Assay—Jurkat T cells were cultured in round-bottom 24-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) and transiently transfected with IL-8/AP-1 or IL-8/AP-1ΔCHOP-RE promoters, as above reported. Where indicated, the cells were co-transfected with wt CHOP, wt c-Jun plasmids, or both, in the presence or absence of CHOP or c-Jun siRNAs. After transfection, the cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies and immediately treated with 10–5 m PGE2. 24 h after stimulation, the supernatants were collected and analyzed for IL-8 production using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (BioSource International, Nivelles, Belgium) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Isolation of nuclear proteins from cultures of 1 × 108 Jurkat T cells grown in RPMI 1640 (Euroclone) with 10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C was performed according to a recently detailed method (11Monici M.C. Aguennouz M. Mazzeo A. Messina C. Vita G. Neurology. 2003; 60: 993-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Where indicated, the nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat T cells 36 h after transfection with c-Jun or TAM-CHOP plasmids.Nuclear extracts (20 μg) were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 50 fmol of biotin-3′-end-labeled, double-strands of different consensus or mutated probes (Table 1) (both complementary oligonucleotides were end-labeled separately and then annealed prior to use). Binding reaction mixture was prepared in a final volume of 20 μl of HEPES buffer containing 1 mg of double-stranded poly(dI/dC), 10% glycerol, 100 mm MgCl2, and 1% Nonidet P-40, performed with the Light-Shift™ Chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For competition assay, 50-fold excess unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides used as competitors were incubated with the extracts at room temperature 10 min prior to probe addition. For antibody supershift assays, the nuclear extracts were incubated with the respective antibodies in the same binding reaction volume for an additional hour at 4 °C. The antibodies used were anti-CHOP (Affinity BioReagents™) and anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). The bound complexes were separated on 7.5% nondenaturating polyacrylamide gels, blotted onto nylon membrane, and visualized on Kodak x-ray film (Kodak) by autoradiography.TABLE 1Sequences of wild type (A, B, and C) and mutated (Mut 1–5) probes employedOligonucleotide nameSequence (5′ → 3′)AaRegion of IL-8 promoter (GenBank™ accession number M28130) between bases -141 and -99.GAAGTGTGATGACTCAGGTTGCCCTGAGGGGATGGGCCATCMut AGAAGTGTGACTTCTCAGGTTGCCCTGAGGGGATGGGCCATCBbRegion of IL-8 promoter between bases -150 and -130.ACAAAATAGGAAGTGTGATGMut B1TGGACCGATGAAGTGTGATGMut B2ACAAAATAGGAAGTGTGGCAMut B3ACAAAATAGTCCGTGTGATGMut B4ACAAAATAGGACACGTGATGMut B5ACAAAATAGGAAGTTACATGCcRegion of IL-8 promoter between bases -129 and -99.TGACTCAGGTTTGCCCTGAGGGATGGGCCATCMut CTGACGACGGTTTGCCCTGAGGGATGGGCCATCa Region of IL-8 promoter (GenBank™ accession number M28130) between bases -141 and -99.b Region of IL-8 promoter between bases -150 and -130.c Region of IL-8 promoter between bases -129 and -99. Open table in a new tab Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP was performed essentially as described by Weinmann and Farnhan (12Weinmann A.S. Farnham P.J. Methods. 2002; 26: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Cultures of 1 × 108 Jurkat T cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (Euroclone) with 10% fetal calf serum (Euroclone) supplemented with 50 IU/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Euroclone) in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cross-linking was induced by adding 1% (v/v) formaldehyde and incubation for 10 min at room temperature on a shaker. After stopping the cross-linking reaction by adding 0.125 m glycine and incubation for 5 min (with shaking at room temperature), the cells were pelletted and washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline including protease inhibitors. The nuclei were isolated by resuspending the cellular pellet in 1 ml of ice-cold swelling buffer (5 mm PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors), split into two aliquots, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Chromatin was fragmented by subjecting the nuclei to sonication procedure, using four pulses of 15 s each at setting 7 on a Fisher model 60 sonic dismembranator.The lysate was combined and transferred to a 15-ml conical tube and diluted with 9 ml of dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors). An aliquot of 500 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) was added to the diluted nuclear lysate and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C while rotating. The beads were pelletted for 10 min at 2000 rpm, and the supernatant was divided into 10 aliquots. 25 μl containing 1 μg of the appropriate monoclonal antibody (c-Jun or CHOP; Chemicon International and Affinity BioReagents, respectively) or no antibody was added to the aliquoted supernatant and incubated at 4 °C overnight while rotating. The pellets were washed twice with 1× dialysis buffer (2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then four times with IP wash buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, protease inhibitors). Elution of antibody-protein-DNA complexes was obtained by the addition of 200 μl of elution buffer (50 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS). Residual traces of Staph A cells were removed adding 1 μl of high concentration of RNase A (Roche Applied Sciences catalog number 1579681; 10 mg/ml) and 12 μl of 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 0.3 m. After incubation of samples at 67 °C for 4–5 h to reverse formaldehyde cross-links, 2.5 volumes of ethanol was added, and precipitation was achieved at –20 °C overnight. DNA extraction was performed with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol protocol. DNA was precipitated adding 30 μl of 5 m NaCl, 5 μg of glycogen (Invitrogen), and 750 μl ethanol for overnight.DNA was dissolved in 10 μl of TE buffer and quantified using a genomic PCR, as reported by Vij et al. (13Vij N. Amoako O.M. Mazur S. Zeitlin P.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 2-μl DNA sample was mixed with 1 μm IL-8 forward primer (CATACTCCGTATTTGATAAGGAAC), 1 μm IL-8 reverse primer (GGCTCTTGTCCTAGAAGCTT), and 16 μl of PCR supermix (Invitrogen). The PCR was carried out as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, 28 three-step cycles: 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Where indicated, DNA was mixed with 1 μm IL-6 forward primer (CCTCAGACATCTCCAGTCCTATA), 1 μm IL-6 reverse primer (TGCTTCTTAGCGCTAGCCTCAAT), and 16 μl of PCR supermix (Invitrogen). The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 10 min, 38 three-step cycles: 94 °C for 40 s, 68 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 60 s. All of the samples were analyzed by 2% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide.Densitometry and Statistical Analysis—The relative intensities of protein and nucleic acid bands were analyzed using the Digital Sciences one-dimensional program from Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems (New Haven, CT). Standard curves were run, and the data that were obtained were in the linear range of the curve. In addition, all of the values were normalized to their respective lane loading controls. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of n determinations. The results were analyzed by two-tailed Student's t test. p values <0.05 were considered significant.RESULTSCHOP Expression after Stimulation with PGE2—Because we have previously shown that PGE2 is able to induce IL-8 promoter expression through phosphorylation and activation of CHOP in T lymphocytes (1Caristi S. Piraino G. Cucinotta M. Valenti A. Loddo S. Teti D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14433-14442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we investigated whether PGE2 also affects the expression of this transcription factor. To this end, reverse transcription-PCR, real-time PCR, and Western blot analyses were performed in Jurkat T cells treated with 10–5 m PGE2 for different periods of time. Fig. 1A shows that the mRNA expression of CHOP was induced by PGE2 at 60 min after treatment and decreased at 180 min, with a peak at 120 min (p < 0.01). These results were confirmed and strengthened by data obtained from quantitative PCR experiments, which showed a similar pattern of mRNA synthesis after PGE2 treatment (Fig. 1B). Fig. 1C shows the increase in CHOP protein levels after PGE2 treatment, which reaches the maximum between 180 and 240 min (p < 0.01). Therefore, PGE2 stimulation leads to a time-dependent increase of CHOP at both mRNA and protein levels.CHOP Domains Involved in the IL-8 Promoter Induction—To identify the CHOP domain(s) responsible for the IL-8 promoter activation in untreated (Fig. 2A, white bars) as well as in PGE2-treated (Fig. 2A, black bars) cells, co-transfection with the wt IL-8 promoter along with constructs overexpressing different CHOP mutants was performed, and luciferase activity in the cell lysates was measured. CHOP mutants that either (i) lacked the basic DNA-binding domain (CHOPΔBR), (ii) lacked the leucine zipper domain (CHOPΔLZ), (iii) lacked both (CHOP-TA), or (iv) were mutated into the p38 MAPK-dependent phosphorylation sites (S79A,S82A) were still able to activate IL-8 promoter activity similarly to wt CHOP (Fig. 2A). The CHOP mutant lacking the transactivation domain (TAM-CHOP) exhibited a slight inhibition of the IL-8 promoter in untreated cells, thus suggesting that the basal activity of IL-8 gene is largely CHOP-independent. In PGE2-treated cells overexpressing the CHOPΔBR, CHOPΔLZ, CHOP-TA, or CHOP (S79A,S82A), the IL-8 promoter activity is up-regulated to the same extent of cells expressing wt CHOP. In contrast, expression of TAM-CHOP highly reduced IL-8 promoter activation when compared with wt CHOP (Fig. 2A, black bars). Thus, PGE2 induces IL-8 gene expression mainly through the CHOP transactivating domain. Of note, all mutants resulted in similar expression levels after transfection (Fig. 2B), thus confirming that the described regulations are specific.FIGURE 2CHOP domains responsible for the activation of IL-8 promoter. A, Jurkat T cells were transfected with wt IL-8 promoter and, where indicated, co-transfected with wt or mutants CHOP expression plasmids. After transfection, Jurkat T cells were treated with anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) plus anti-CD28 (250 ng/ml) antibodies in the absence (white bars) or presence (black bars) of 10–5m PGE2. The data are the means ± S.D. of five independent experiments and are expressed as fold induction. β-Galactosidase levels were determined for transfection efficiency. **, p < 0.01 versus wt CHOP co-transfected cells, based on two-tailed Student's t test.

https://openalex.org/W2041711534,"Genetic regulatory networks of sequence specific transcription factors underlie pattern formation in multicellular organisms. Deciphering and representing the mammalian networks is a central problem in development, neurobiology, and regenerative medicine. Transcriptional networks specify intermingled embryonic cell populations during pattern formation in the vertebrate neural tube. Each embryonic population gives rise to a distinct type of adult neuron. The homeodomain transcription factor Lbx1 is expressed in five such populations and loss of Lbx1 leads to distinct respecifications in each of the five populations.We have purified normal and respecified pools of these five populations from embryos bearing one or two copies of the null Lbx1(GFP) allele, respectively. Microarrays were used to show that expression levels of 8% of all transcription factor genes were altered in the respecified pool. These transcription factor genes constitute 20-30% of the active nodes of the transcriptional network that governs neural tube patterning. Half of the 141 regulated nodes were located in the top 150 clusters of ultraconserved non-coding regions. Generally, Lbx1 repressed genes that have expression patterns outside of the Lbx1-expressing domain and activated genes that have expression patterns inside the Lbx1-expressing domain.Constraining epistasis analysis of Lbx1 to only those cells that normally express Lbx1 allowed unprecedented sensitivity in identifying Lbx1 network interactions and allowed the interactions to be assigned to a specific set of cell populations. We call this method ANCEA, or active node constrained epistasis analysis, and think that it will be generally useful in discovering and assigning network interactions to specific populations. We discuss how ANCEA, coupled with population partitioning analysis, can greatly facilitate the systematic dissection of transcriptional networks that underlie mammalian patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1989319811,"Clathrin is a multimeric protein involved in vesicle coat assembly. Recently clathrin distribution was reported to change during the cell cycle and was found to associate with the mitotic spindle. Here we test whether the recruitment of clathrin to the spindle is indicative of a critical functional contribution to mitosis.Previously a chicken pre-B lymphoma cell line (DKO-R) was developed in which the endogenous clathrin heavy chain alleles were replaced with the human clathrin heavy chain under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter. Receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis were significantly inhibited in this line following clathrin knockout, and we used this to explore the significance of clathrin heavy chain expression for cell cycle progression. We confirmed using confocal microscopy that clathrin colocalised with tubulin at mitotic spindles. Using a propidium iodide flow cytometric assay we found no statistical difference in the cell cycle distribution of the knockout cells versus the wild-type. Additionally, we showed that the ploidy and the recovery kinetics following cell cycle arrest with nocodazole were unchanged by repressing clathrin heavy chain expression.We conclude that the association of clathrin with the mitotic spindle and the contribution of clathrin to endocytosis are evolutionarily conserved. However we find that the contribution of clathrin to mitosis is less robust and dependent on cellular context. In other cell-lines silencing RNA has been used by others to knockdown clathrin expression resulting in an increase in the mitotic index of the cells. We show an effect on the G2/M phase population of clathrin knockdown in HEK293 cells but show that repressing clathrin expression in the DKO-R cell-line has no effect on the size of this population. Consequently this work highlights the need for a more detailed molecular understanding of the recruitment and function of clathrin at the spindle, since the localisation but not the impact of clathrin on mitosis appears to be robust in plants, mammalian and chicken B-cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017324258,"Background Malaria-causing Plasmodium species exhibit marked differences including host choice and preference for invading particular cell types. The genetic bases of phenotypic differences between parasites can be understood, in part, by investigating constraints on gene expression and genic sequences, both coding and regulatory. Methodology/Principal Findings We investigated the evolutionary constraints on sequence and expression of parasitic genes by applying comparative genomics approaches to 6 Plasmodium genomes and 2 genome-wide expression studies. We found that the coding regions of Plasmodium transcription factor and sexual development genes are relatively less constrained, as are those of genes encoding CCCH zinc fingers and invasion proteins, which all play important roles in these parasites. Transcription factors and genes with stage-restricted expression have conserved upstream regions and so do several gene classes critical to the parasite's lifestyle, namely, ion transport, invasion, chromatin assembly and CCCH zinc fingers. Additionally, a cross-species comparison of expression patterns revealed that Plasmodium-specific genes exhibit significant expression divergence. Conclusions/Significance Overall, constraints on Plasmodium's protein coding regions confirm observations from other eukaryotes in that transcription factors are under relatively lower constraint. Proteins relevant to the parasite's unique lifestyle also have lower constraint on their coding regions. Greater conservation between Plasmodium species in terms of promoter motifs suggests tight regulatory control of lifestyle genes. However, an interspecies divergence in expression patterns of these genes suggests that either expression is controlled via genomic or epigenomic features not encoded in the proximal promoter sequence, or alternatively, the combinatorial interactions between motifs confer species-specific expression patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2043295385,"The transmission of genomic information from coding sequence to protein structure during protein synthesis is subject to stochastic errors. To analyze transmission limits in the presence of spurious errors, Shannon's noisy channel theorem is applied to a communication channel between amino acid sequences and their structures established from a large-scale statistical analysis of protein atomic coordinates. While Shannon's theorem confirms that in close to native conformations information is transmitted with limited error probability, additional random errors in sequence (amino acid substitutions) and in structure (structural defects) trigger a decrease in communication capacity toward a Shannon limit at 0.010 bits per amino acid symbol at which communication breaks down. In several controls, simulated error rates above a critical threshold and models of unfolded structures always produce capacities below this limiting value. Thus an essential biological system can be realistically modeled as a digital communication channel that is (a) sensitive to random errors and (b) restricted by a Shannon error limit. This forms a novel basis for predictions consistent with observed rates of defective ribosomal products during protein synthesis, and with the estimated excess of mutual information in protein contact potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2037501342,We investigated the effects of object relative size on priming and explicit memory for color photos of common objects. Participants were presented with color photos of pairs of objects displayed in either appropriate or inappropriate relative sizes. Implicit memory was assessed by speed of object size ratings whereas explicit memory was assessed by an old/new recognition test. Study-to-test changes in relative size reduced both priming and explicit memory and had large effects for objects displayed in large vs. small size at test. Our findings of substantial size-specific influences on priming with common objects under some but not other conditions are consistent with instance views of object perception and priming but inconsistent with structural description views.
