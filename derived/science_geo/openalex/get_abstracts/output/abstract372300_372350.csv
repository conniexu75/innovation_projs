https://openalex.org/W2155619616,"Abscisic acid (ABA) is a ubiquitous hormone that regulates plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. Its action is mediated by the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of START proteins, but it remains unclear how these receptors bind ABA and, in turn, how hormone binding leads to inhibition of the downstream type 2C protein phosphatase (PP2C) effectors. Here we report crystal structures of apo and ABA-bound receptors as well as a ternary PYL2–ABA–PP2C complex. The apo receptors contain an open ligand-binding pocket flanked by a gate that closes in response to ABA by way of conformational changes in two highly conserved β-loops that serve as a gate and latch. Moreover, ABA-induced closure of the gate creates a surface that enables the receptor to dock into and competitively inhibit the PP2C active site. A conserved tryptophan in the PP2C inserts directly between the gate and latch, which functions to further lock the receptor in a closed conformation. Together, our results identify a conserved gate–latch–lock mechanism underlying ABA signalling. Abscisic acid (ABA) an important plant hormone acting as regulator of plant responses to environmental stresses such as drought and cold. Major players in the ABA signalling pathway include the type 2 phosphatases, ABI1 and ABI2, that negatively regulate ABA responses. Recently a family of proteins known as PYR/PYL/RCAR has been identified, the members of which bind ABA and mediate inactivation of ABI1 and ABI2. In this study, Xu and colleagues present a set of structures which include unbound ABA and ABA bound to some of its receptors, as well as the ternary complex PYL2–ABA–PP2C. The structural data, in conjunction with extensive biochemical studies, reveal a gate–latch–lock mechanism underlying ABA signalling. The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) is a regulator of plant growth, development and responses to environmental stresses. Recently, the PYR/PYL/RCAR family of START proteins was found to bind ABA and mediate inactivation of downstream effectors. The crystal structures of apo and ABA-bound receptors as well as a ternary PYL2–ABA–PP2C complex is now reported and analysed, revealing a gate–latch–lock mechanism underlying ABA signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2099487576,"<h2>Summary</h2> The licensing of eukaryotic DNA replication origins, which ensures once-per-cell-cycle replication, involves the loading of six related minichromosome maintenance proteins (Mcm2–7) into prereplicative complexes (pre-RCs). Mcm2–7 forms the core of the replicative DNA helicase, which is inactive in the pre-RC. The loading of Mcm2–7 onto DNA requires the origin recognition complex (ORC), Cdc6, and Cdt1, and depends on ATP. We have reconstituted Mcm2–7 loading with purified budding yeast proteins. Using biochemical approaches and electron microscopy, we show that single heptamers of Cdt1•Mcm2–7 are loaded cooperatively and result in association of stable, head-to-head Mcm2–7 double hexamers connected via their N-terminal rings. DNA runs through a central channel in the double hexamer, and, once loaded, Mcm2–7 can slide passively along double-stranded DNA. Our work has significant implications for understanding how eukaryotic DNA replication origins are chosen and licensed, how replisomes assemble during initiation, and how unwinding occurs during DNA replication."

Here we show that FoxO3, a member of a transcription factor family known to extend lifespan in invertebrates, regulates the NSC pool. We find that adult FoxO3−/− mice have fewer NSCs in vivo than wild-type counterparts. NSCs isolated from adult FoxO3−/− mice have decreased self-renewal and an impaired ability to generate different neural lineages. Identification of the FoxO3-dependent gene expression profile in NSCs suggests that FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool by inducing a program of genes that preserves quiescence, prevents premature differentiation, and controls oxygen metabolism. The ability of FoxO3 to prevent the premature depletion of NSCs might have important implications for counteracting brain aging in long-lived species.

The ability of FoxO3 to prevent the premature depletion of NSCs might have important implications for counteracting brain aging in long-lived species. Neural stem cells (NSCs) can self-renew and generate all three neural lineages of the nervous system: neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. During embryonic and postnatal development, NSCs give rise to rapidly amplifying neural progenitors, which are responsible for the proper formation of the nervous system. The adult mammalian brain contains two residual populations of relatively quiescent NSCs in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the cortex (Alvarez-Buylla and Temple, 1998Alvarez-Buylla A.

In the adult brain, the generation of new neurons (neurogenesis) from NSCs is thought to play an important role in learning and memory, spatial pattern separation, and odor discrimination (Clelland et al., 2009Clelland C.D.

Both the number of NSCs and neurogenesis decline with age and this age-dependent decline is correlated with a gradual loss of cognitive and sensory functions (Bondolfi et al., 2004Bondolfi L. Ermini F. Long J.M. Ingram D.K. Jucker M. Impact of age and caloric restriction on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of C57BL/6 mice.Neurobiol.

Conversely, the pool of NSCs, neurogenesis, and cognitive performance in adults are preserved in a strain of long-lived mutant mice (Kinney et al., 2001Kinney B.A. Meliska C.J. Steger R.W. Bartke A.

Thus, an intact pool of functional NSCs may be crucial for preserving cognitive functions throughout life. The polycomb family member Bmi-1 has been recently found to play an important role in NSC self-renewal by negatively regulating the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP1 in embryonic NSCs (Fasano et al., 2007Fasano C.A. Dimos J.T. Ivanova N.B. Lowry N. Lemischka I.R.

Increasing p16INK4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors and neurogenesis during ageing.Nature. 2006; 443: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). TLX, a nuclear receptor, also regulates NSC self-renewal during development and adulthood in a cell-autonomous manner (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang C.L. Zou Y. He W. Gage F.H. Evans R.M. A role for adult TLX-positive neural stem cells in learning and behaviour.Nature. 2008; 451: 1004-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms to regulate the self-renewal and multipotency of NSCs throughout life remain largely unknown, but one intriguing possibility is that genes that regulate lifespan in invertebrates may have evolved to control stem cell pools in mammals. FoxO transcription factors are necessary for the extreme longevity of mutants of the insulin pathway in invertebrates (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: Insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In humans, single-nucleotide polymorphisms in one of the four FoxO genes, FoxO3, have recently been associated with extreme longevity (Flachsbart et al., 2009Flachsbart F. Caliebe A. Kleindorp R. Blanche H. von Eller-Eberstein H. Nikolaus S. Schreiber S. Nebel A. Association of FOXO3A variation with human longevity confirmed in German centenarians.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

FOXO3A genotype is strongly associated with human longevity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 13987-13992Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that FoxO3 also regulates lifespan in mammals. FoxO factors can elicit a variety of cellular responses, including cell cycle arrest, differentiation, resistance to oxidative stress, and apoptosis (Salih and Brunet, 2008Salih D.A. Brunet A. FoxO transcription factors in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis during aging.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). FoxO factors have recently been found to regulate the self-renewal of adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), primarily by providing resistance to oxidative stress (Miyamoto et al., 2007Miyamoto K. Araki K.A. Naka K. Arai F. Takubo K. Yamazaki S. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto T. Ito K.

Sears C. et al.FoxOs are critical mediators of hematopoietic stem cell resistance to physiologic oxidative stress.Cell. 2007; 128: 325-339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Whether and how FoxO transcription factors regulate NSCs is unknown. FoxO transcription factors are inactivated in response to insulin or growth factors by phosphorylation by the protein kinase Akt, which results in their nuclear export (Salih and Brunet, 2008Salih D.A. Brunet A. FoxO transcription factors in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis during aging.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, for example by ablation of the gene encoding the PTEN phosphatase, promotes the self-renewal of neural progenitor cells (Groszer et al., 2006Groszer M. Erickson R. Scripture-Adams D.D. Dougherty J.D. Le Belle J. Zack J.A. Geschwind D.H. Liu X. Kornblum H.I. Wu H. PTEN negatively regulates neural stem cell self-renewal by modulating G0–G1 cell cycle entry.Proc.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8531-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the role of the PI3K-Akt pathway in the NSC pool in vivo has not been examined and the PI3K-Akt pathway has many other downstream targets in addition to FoxO factors. Here we show that the transcription factor FoxO3, a member of a gene family that extends lifespan in invertebrates, is necessary for the regulation of the NSC pool in mice. We also identify the program of genes regulated by FoxO3 in NSCs. Our findings suggest that FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool by inducing a program that promotes quiescence, prevents premature differentiation, and controls oxygen metabolism. FoxO3's ability to regulate NSC homeostasis may protect normal cognitive function in organisms that live to an advanced age. To determine whether FoxO3 protein is expressed in NSC niches in the adult mouse brain, we used an antibody that recognized FoxO3 but did not significantly detect FoxO1, FoxO4, or FoxO6 in cells (Figures S1A–S1C available online). We stained brain sections of adult FoxO3+/+ and FoxO3−/− mice with this antibody and found that FoxO3 is expressed in both the SGZ and the SVZ (Figure S2A). Western blotting experiments confirmed that FoxO3 is highly expressed in NSC niches in vivo (Figure S2B). NSC niches contain NSCs, committed progenitors, and differentiated progeny. To determine whether FoxO3 is expressed in NSCs in vivo, we stained brain sections with antibodies to FoxO3 and to Sox2, a marker of NSCs/neural progenitors, or to NeuN, a marker of neurons (Figure 1A). These experiments revealed that FoxO3 is expressed in Sox2-positive cells in the SGZ and the SVZ (Figure 1A). FoxO3 is expressed in a subset of NeuN-negative cells (Figure 1A, bottom, white arrows) and in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive label-retaining cells, which are thought to be NSCs (Figure S2C; see Figure 2). These results indicate that FoxO3 is expressed in adult NSCs, as well as in other cells in the NSC niches. The fact that FoxO3 staining overlaps with the nuclear staining of Sox2 and BrdU further suggests that FoxO3 is nuclear in adult NSCs and therefore likely to be active in these cells (Figure 1A; Figure S2C).Figure 2The Ablation of FoxO3 Results in a Decrease in NSC Number In VivoShow full caption(A) Experimental design for the quantification of NSCs in vivo. 5-month-old FoxO3+/+ and FoxO3−/− littermates were injected daily with BrdU for 7 days and sacrificed 1 month after the last BrdU injection.(B) Quantification of label-retaining NSCs in vivo.

To confirm that FoxO3 is expressed in NSCs, we isolated NSCs from both the DG and the SVZ regions of the postnatal or adult mouse brain. Mouse NSCs form clonal spheres called neurospheres, which are composed of NSCs and more committed neural progenitors (Reynolds and Weiss, 1992Reynolds B.A. Weiss S. Generation of neurons and astrocytes from isolated cells of the adult mammalian central nervous system.Science. 1992; 255: 1707-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (4416) Google Scholar). Immunostaining experiments on whole neurospheres or on dissociated NSCs revealed that FoxO3 is expressed in NSCs/progenitors derived from both postnatal and adult animals and is coexpressed with Nestin, a NSC/progenitor marker (Figure 1B; Figure S3A). To quantify the levels of FoxO3 in NSCs as a function of age, we used western blotting on protein extracts of neurospheres from NSCs isolated from mice at three different age milestones: birth (1-day-old), adulthood (3-month-old), and middle age (1-year-old). These experiments confirmed that FoxO3 is expressed in NSCs from mice at all ages (Figure 1C). FoxO3 protein expression is lower in NSCs from neonates than in NSCs from adults, but there was no significant change in FoxO3 expression in NSCs from young versus middle-aged adults (Figure 1C). Thus, FoxO3 is expressed in NSCs/progenitors from both developing and adult mice, with higher expression in adult NSCs. To assess FoxO3 activity in NSCs, we compared the phosphorylation status of FoxO3 in self-renewing versus differentiating adult NSCs via western blotting with phospho-specific antibodies to Threonine 32 (T32), one of the three sites of FoxO3 phosphorylated by Akt (Brunet et al., 1999Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar). A larger percentage of FoxO3 was phosphorylated at T32 in differentiated progeny than in self-renewing NSCs (Figure 1D; Figure S3B). As T32 phosphorylation is correlated with FoxO3 inactivation (Brunet et al., 1999Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar), these results suggest that FoxO3 is more active in self-renewing NSCs than in their differentiated progeny. To quantify FoxO3 activity in NSCs, we performed luciferase assays by using a luciferase reporter gene under the control of three Forkhead binding sites (Brunet et al., 1999Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5226) Google Scholar). We first verified that this FoxO reporter gene was responsive to FoxO3 in NSCs by transfecting wild-type adult NSCs with active or inactive forms of FoxO3 (Figure 1E). We next tested the activity of endogenous FoxO3 in NSCs and found that this FoxO reporter gene was active in adult FoxO3+/+ NSCs and that its activity was significantly decreased in FoxO3−/− NSCs (Figure 1F). The remainder of the activity of the FoxO reporter gene in FoxO3−/− NSCs is likely due to partial compensation by other FoxO family members. Taken together, these findings indicate that FoxO3 is active in self-renewing NSCs. To determine whether FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool in vivo, we performed BrdU injection experiments in adult FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ mice (Figure 2). FoxO3−/− mice are viable and normal in outward appearance, though they are prone to cancer and die at around 1 to 1.5 years of age (data not shown; Paik et al., 2007Paik J.H. Kollipara R. Chu G. Ji H. Xiao Y. Ding Z. Miao L. Tothova Z. Horner J.W. Carrasco D.R. et al.FoxOs are lineage-restricted redundant tumor suppressors and regulate endothelial cell homeostasis.Cell. 2007; 128: 309-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). BrdU was injected daily into adult FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ littermates for 7 days and the mice were sacrificed either 1 month (Figure 2A) or 1 day (Figure 2D) after the last BrdU injection. We counted BrdU-positive cells in the NSC niches 1 month after the last BrdU injection (Figures 2B and 2C; Figure S4A). These label-retaining cells are thought to be the relatively quiescent NSCs that remain in NSC niches whereas neural progenitors and differentiated cells migrate away from NSC niches (Bondolfi et al., 2004Bondolfi L. Ermini F. Long J.M. Ingram D.K. Jucker M. Impact of age and caloric restriction on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of C57BL/6 mice.Neurobiol. Aging. 2004; 25: 333-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). FoxO3−/− mice displayed a significant reduction in the number of label-retaining NSCs compared to FoxO3+/+ mice in both the SGZ (Figure 2B, left) and the SVZ (Figures 2B, right, and Figure S4A). This result suggests that in the absence of FoxO3, adult mice have fewer NSCs. In contrast, when mice were sacrificed 1 day after the BrdU injections (Figure 2D), FoxO3−/− mice tended to have more BrdU-positive cells than FoxO3+/+ mice in the SGZ (p = 0.40) and the SVZ (p = 0.10) (Figure 2E). BrdU-positive cells in the short-term BrdU paradigm are mostly neural progenitors, so these results indicate that in FoxO3−/− mice, the number of progenitors is not decreased and may even be slightly increased. Consistent with this finding, brains from adult FoxO3−/− mice were significantly heavier than brains from wild-type counterparts. In contrast, brains from FoxO3−/− mice had similar weight as wild-type counterparts at birth (Figure 2F). Together, these results suggest that FoxO3 loss may lead to the short-term amplification of progenitors, resulting in the exhaustion of the NSC pool over time. To independently test whether FoxO3 prevents the progressive depletion of NSCs in vivo, we isolated NSCs from adult FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ mice and tested the ability of these cells to form primary neurospheres. The frequency of primary neurospheres formed at low cell density from freshly isolated NSCs can be used as an estimate of the pool size of NSCs in the brain and indirectly as a measure of self-renewal (Kippin et al., 2005Kippin T.E. Martens D.J. van der Kooy D. p21 loss compromises the relative quiescence of forebrain stem cell proliferation leading to exhaustion of their proliferation capacity.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 756-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We found that NSCs from adult FoxO3−/− mice formed primary neurospheres at a significantly lower frequency than NSCs from FoxO3+/+ littermates (Figure 3A). Although neurospheres can fuse, which can limit the interpretation of these experiments (Reynolds and Rietze, 2005Reynolds B.A. Rietze R.L. Neural stem cells and neurospheres—re-evaluating the relationship.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 333-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), these results confirm that FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool. These findings are also consistent with the possibility that FoxO3 is necessary for NSC self-renewal. To compare the ability of FoxO3 to regulate the NSC pool at different ages, we isolated NSCs from FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ mice at different ages. FoxO3−/− NSCs isolated from embryos (data not shown) or from 1-day-old mice (Figure 3B; Figure S5A) formed primary neurospheres with the same frequency as FoxO3+/+ NSCs. In contrast, FoxO3−/− NSCs isolated from both young adult mice and middle-aged mice formed neurospheres at a significantly lower frequency than FoxO3+/+ NSCs (Figure 3B; Figure S5B). These results indicate that the absence of FoxO3 leads to defects in the NSC pool that are evident only in adult mice. Because FoxO3 is constitutively deleted in FoxO3−/− mice, it is not possible to distinguish whether FoxO3 regulates the NSC pool only in adults or whether FoxO3 also acts in NSCs during embryonic and/or postnatal development. As previously reported (Molofsky et al., 2006Molofsky A.V. Slutsky S.G. Joseph N.M. He S. Pardal R. Krishnamurthy J. Sharpless N.E. Morrison S.J. Increasing p16INK4a expression decreases forebrain progenitors and neurogenesis during ageing.Nature. 2006; 443: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), the frequency of primary neurospheres formed in culture decreased significantly with the age of the mice (Figure 3B). The absence of FoxO3 did not have a greater impact on NSCs from middle-aged mice than in NSCs from young adult mice (Figure 3B), which might be due to a progressive inactivation of FoxO3 function during aging. We tested whether FoxO3 is necessary for NSC self-renewal. Primary neurospheres can be dissociated to generate secondary neurospheres, and the number of secondary neurospheres formed can serve as a measure of NSC self-renewal (Kippin et al., 2005Kippin T.E. Martens D.J. van der Kooy D. p21 loss compromises the relative quiescence of forebrain stem cell proliferation leading to exhaustion of their proliferation capacity.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 756-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We dissociated FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ primary neurospheres and tested the ability of the dissociated cells to form secondary neurospheres. Whereas FoxO3−/− NSCs from neonates formed secondary neurospheres at the same frequency as FoxO3+/+ NSCs, FoxO3−/− NSCs isolated from young and middle-aged adults generated fewer secondary neurospheres than FoxO3+/+ NSCs (Figure 3C; Figures S5C–S5E). This result suggests that FoxO3 regulates NSC self-renewal. The ability of adult FoxO3−/− NSCs to form neurospheres at later passages in vitro was not significantly different from that of FoxO3+/+ NSCs (Figure S5F), perhaps because other FoxO family members compensate for the lack of FoxO3 after several passages in culture. Concomitant deletion of FoxO1, FoxO3, and FoxO4 results in defects in neurosphere formation upon serial passage in culture (Paik et al., 2009Paik J.-h. Ding Z. Narurkar R. Ramkissoon S. Muller F. Kamoun W.S. Chae S.-S. Zheng H. Ying H. Mahoney J. et al.FoxOs cooperatively regulate diverse pathways governing neural stem cell homeostasis.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5 (this issue): 540-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar [this issue]), confirming the functional redundancy among FoxO family members in cultured NSCs. These results suggest that FoxO3 prevents the premature exhaustion of NSCs by preserving their self-renewal capacity. NSCs give rise to three types of progeny (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), and the proper balance between the three fates is pivotal for the functionality of the NSC pool. The ability of NSCs to generate progeny can be measured by assessing cellular fates in secondary neurospheres, because each neurosphere derives from a single NSC (Kippin et al., 2005Kippin T.E. Martens D.J. van der Kooy D. p21 loss compromises the relative quiescence of forebrain stem cell proliferation leading to exhaustion of their proliferation capacity.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 756-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We examined the progeny of FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ secondary neurospheres after 7 days in differentiation conditions. Neurospheres generated from adult NSCs contained mainly astrocytes (GFAP positive), as well as fewer numbers of immature neurons (Tuj1 positive) or immature oligodendrocytes (O4 positive) (Figure 4A), indicating that these neurospheres arose from at least bipotent NSCs. To measure NSC functionality, we scored the number of differentiated secondary neurospheres formed at low cell density that contain at least one immature neuron (Tuj1 positive) or one immature oligodendrocyte (O4 positive) in addition to astrocytes. We found that NSCs isolated from neonate FoxO3−/− and FoxO3+/+ mice formed similar numbers of bipotent neurospheres (Figures 4B and 4C). In contrast, NSCs isolated from young or middle-aged adult FoxO3−/− mice formed significantly fewer secondary neurospheres containing oligodendrocytes than those isolated from FoxO3+/+ mice (Figure 4B). FoxO3−/− NSCs from middle-aged mice tended to form fewer neurospheres containing both"

Although the concept of cancer stem cells reveals a new framework of cancer therapeutic strategies against malignant glioma, it remains unclear how glioma stem cells could be eradicated. Here, we demonstrate that autocrine TGF-β signaling plays an essential role in retention of stemness of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) and describe the underlying mechanism for it. TGF-β induced expression of Sox2, a stemness gene, and this induction was mediated by Sox4, a direct TGF-β target gene. Inhibitors of TGF-β signaling drastically deprived tumorigenicity of GICs by promoting their differentiation, and these effects were attenuated in GICs transduced with Sox2 or Sox4. Furthermore, GICs pretreated with TGF-β signaling inhibitor exhibited less lethal potency in intracranial transplantation assay. These results identify an essential pathway for GICs, the TGF-β-Sox4-Sox2 pathway, whose disruption would be a therapeutic strategy against gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W1965306647,"The PI3K-AKT-FoxO pathway is integral to lifespan regulation in lower organisms and essential for the stability of long-lived cells in mammals. Here, we report the impact of combined FoxO1, 3, and 4 deficiencies on mammalian brain physiology with a particular emphasis on the study of the neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) pool. We show that the FoxO family plays a prominent role in NSC proliferation and renewal. FoxO-deficient mice show initial increased brain size and proliferation of neural progenitor cells during early postnatal life, followed by precocious significant decline in the NSC pool and accompanying neurogenesis in adult brains. Mechanistically, integrated transcriptomic, promoter, and functional analyses of FoxO-deficient NSC cultures identified direct gene targets with known links to the regulation of human brain size and the control of cellular proliferation, differentiation, and oxidative defense. Thus, the FoxO family coordinately regulates diverse genes and pathways to govern key aspects of NSC homeostasis in the mammalian brain."
https://openalex.org/W1964692745,"Defining the molecular identity of stem cells may be critical for formulating a rational strategy for the therapeutic intervention of stem cell dysfunction. We find that high expression of Id1, a dominant-negative helix-loop-helix transcriptional regulator, identifies a rare population of GFAP(+) astrocytes with stem cell attributes among the subventricular astrocytes in the adult brain. The rare, long-lived, and relatively quiescent Id1(high) astrocytes with morphology characteristic of B1 type astrocytes self-renew and generate migratory neuroblasts that differentiate into olfactory bulb interneurons. Cultured Id1(high) neural stem cells can self-renew asymmetrically and generate a stem and a differentiated cell expressing progressively lower levels of Id1, revealing an Id1 gradient in unperturbed cells of subventricular neurogenic lineages. Moreover, Id genes are necessary to confer self-renewal capacity, a characteristic of stem cell identity. We suggest that high expression of a single transcriptional regulator, Id1, molecularly defines the long-sought-after B1 type adult neural stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2065018564,"The regulation of HIF-1α is considered to be realized by pVHL-mediated ubiquitin-26S proteasome pathway at a post-transcriptional level. The discovery of a class of small noncoding RNAs, called microRNAs, implies alternative mechanism of regulation of HIF-1α. Here, we show that miR-20b plays an important role in fine-tuning the adaptation of tumor cells to oxygen concentration. The inhibition of miR-20b increased the protein levels of HIF-1α and VEGF in normoxic tumor cells; the increase of miR-20b in hypoxic tumor cells, nevertheless, decreased the protein levels of HIF-1α and VEGF. By using luciferase reporter vector system, we confirmed that miR-20b directly targeted the 3′UTR of Hif1a and Vegfa. On the other hand, the forced overexpression of HIF-1α in normoxic tumor cells downregulated miR-20b expression. However, HIF-1α knockdown in hypoxic tumor cells caused the increase of miR-20b. The differential expression of miR-20b has important biological significance in tumor cells, either enhancing the growth or favoring the survival of tumor cells upon the oxygen supply. Thus, we identify a novel molecular regulation mechanism through which miR-20b regulates HIF-1α and VEGF and is regulated by HIF-1α so to keep tumor cells adapting to different oxygen concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2057253193,"Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), one of the archea-type rhodopsins from green algae, is a potentially useful optogenetic tool for restoring vision in patients with photoreceptor degeneration, such as retinitis pigmentosa. If the ChR2 gene is transferred to retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which send visual information to the brain, the RGCs may be repurposed to act as photoreceptors. In this study, by using a transgenic rat expressing ChR2 specifically in the RGCs under the regulation of a Thy-1.2 promoter, we tested the possibility that direct photoactivation of RGCs could restore effective vision. Although the contrast sensitivities of the optomotor responses of transgenic rats were similar to those observed in the wild-type rats, they were enhanced for visual stimuli of low-spatial frequency after the degeneration of native photoreceptors. This result suggests that the visual signals derived from the ChR2-expressing RGCs were reinterpreted by the brain to form behavior-related vision."

Harold Weintraub's laboratory showed that a single gene, encoding the transcription factor MyoD, can induce the differentiation of fibroblasts into myotubes (Davis et al., 1987Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Expression of a single transfected cDNA converts fibroblasts to myoblasts.Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar). The subsequent finding that MyoD can also induce the expression of muscle genes in cell lines of ectodermal and endodermal origin (Weintraub et al., 1989Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Activation of muscle-specific genes in pigment, nerve, fat, liver, and fibroblast cell lines by forced expression of MyoD.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that fully specialized cells can be reprogrammed into other cell types. Indeed, experiments with avian myeloid leukemia cells showed that GATA-1 can convert the cells into megakaryocytic/erythroid cells. The cells not only activated genes of the megakaryocytic/erythroid lineage but also downregulated macrophage genes (Kulessa et al., 1995Kulessa H. Frampton J. Graf T. GATA-1 reprograms avian myelomonocytic cell lines into eosinophils, thromboblasts, and erythroblasts.Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1250-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Since then, transcription factors have been used to reprogram a number of other tissues, such as cultured astrocytes into neuronal cells by Pax6 (Heins et al., 2002Heins N. Malatesta P. Cecconi F. Nakafuku M. Tucker K.L. Hack M.A. Chapouton P. Barde Y.A. Gotz M. Glial cells generate neurons: The role of the transcription factor Pax6.Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 308-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar); pancreatic cells into liver cells by activation of C/EBPβ (Shen et al., 2003Shen C.N. Horb M.E. Slack J.M. Tosh D. Transdifferentiation of pancreas to liver.Mech. Dev. 2003; 120: 107-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar); B cells into macrophages by C/EBPα (Xie et al., 2004Xie H. Ye M. Feng R. Graf T. Stepwise reprogramming of B cells into macrophages.Cell. 2004; 117: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar); and embryonic stem cells into the trophectoderm by Cdx2 (Niwa et al., 2005Niwa H. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Strumpf D. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Rossant J. Interaction between Oct3/4 and Cdx2 determines trophectoderm differentiation.Cell. 2005; 123: 917-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Direct reprogramming of specialized cells has also been shown in vivo. Thus, an activated form of Pdx1 induces hepatic cells to turn into pancreatic beta islet cells in Xenopus (Horb et al., 2003Horb M.E. Shen C.N. Tosh D. Slack J.M. Experimental conversion of liver to pancreas.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). More recently, a combination of Pdx1 with Ngn1 and MafA was shown to reprogram exocrine cells into beta islet cells in the mouse pancreas (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou Q. Brown J. Kanarek A. Rajagopal J. Melton D.A. In vivo reprogramming of adult pancreatic exocrine cells to beta-cells.Nature. 2008; 455: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). Given enough knowledge about how lineages are reprogrammed, it might therefore one day become feasible to directly custom-make any desired cell type in cultures or in patients. To unravel the molecular basis of lineage reprogramming, a cell system would be desirable where reprogramming can be induced with high efficiency and within a short time span and cell numbers are not limiting. Several of these requirements are met by the conversion of primary lymphoid cells into myeloid cells. For example, the enforced expression of C/EBPα by retroviral infection can convert more than 60% committed B and T cell progenitors into macrophages (Xie et al., 2004Xie H. Ye M. Feng R. Graf T. Stepwise reprogramming of B cells into macrophages.Cell. 2004; 117: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar, Laiosa et al., 2006bLaiosa C.V. Stadtfeld M. Xie H. de Andres-Aguayo L. Graf T. Reprogramming of committed T cell progenitors to macrophages and dendritic cells by C/EBP alpha and PU.1 transcription factors.Immunity. 2006; 25: 731-744Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The frequency of induced lymphoid to macrophage conversions is therefore substantially higher compared to the reprogramming of somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) by embryonic stem cell-associated transcription factors (Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006Takahashi K. Yamanaka S. Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors.Cell. 2006; 126: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18957) Google Scholar). However, even primary lymphoid cells are not ideal because an important fraction of the cells are resistant to reprogramming, the cultures require stromal cells, and cell numbers are limiting. In addition, for every experiment the starting population has to be freshly isolated from bone marrow and infected with retroviruses, and the infected cells have to be sorted before analyses. Here we describe a pre-B cell line that can be converted by C/EBPα into macrophage-like cells at 100% efficiency within 2 to 3 days in the absence of stroma. The induced cells exhibit dramatic changes in gene expression within hours and acquire functional macrophage properties. Time-lapse experiments showed that all cells change in morphology and become highly motile. Furthermore, we showed that the system can be used to test for genes with the capacity to specifically perturb cell reprogramming. To develop a reprogrammable cell line system, we screened two adult and one fetal pre-B cell lines for their ability to convert into macrophages after ectopic expression of C/EBPα. To overcome the problem that uninfected B cells rapidly overgrow the reprogrammed cells, we generated an inducible virus, containing a fusion between C/EBPα and the estrogen hormone binding domain (C/EBPαER), as well as GFP, as an infection marker (Figure 1A). GFP-positive clones isolated from the lines were infected with this virus, treated with β-estradiol, and analyzed for Mac-1 (CD11b) and CD19 expression at different times thereafter. Clones from the fetal-derived cell line HAFTL responded most completely and rapidly and one clone, C10, was selected for further studies. HAFTL cells, which contain a normal, diploid karyotype of 20 chromosomes (Figure S1 available online), resemble pre-B cells (B220+CD19+, CD43−IgM−), and will be called “B cells” in the following. Treatment of C10 cells with β-estradiol induced a substantial increase in Mac-1 expression and downregulation of CD19 already within 1 day, and after 3 days essentially 100% of the cells showed a reciprocal regulation of these markers (Figures 1B and 1C). The kinetics of induced antigen expression changes were highly reproducible, with values varying less then 10% in repeat experiments. Induced C10 cells showed an increase in size and granularity (Figures 1E and 1F) and most cells became adherent (Figure S2A). No changes in antigen expression or cellular parameters were seen in solvent-treated C10 cells (Figure 1D) or HAFTL cells treated with β-estradiol. We also determined their growth and survival properties. Whereas untreated C10 cells kept growing and then slowed down after 3 days because of overcrowding, induced cells doubled in number within the first day and then remained quiescent. In addition, there was little increase in dead or apoptotic cells during the 3-day observation period, although the cells became heterogeneous in size and shape after prolonged culturing (Figures S2B–S2D). To reveal structural changes, C10 cells were induced for 3 days, fixed, stained, and photographed with a fluorescence microscope. Staining of mannosidase II revealed reorganization of the Golgi apparatus from a symmetric to a polar structure located at one side of the nucleus, facing away from the lamellipodium at the leading edge of the cell (Figure 2A). Staining of F-actin revealed massive actin accumulations at the leading edge, while the trailing edge showed the formation of stress fibers and increased concentration of Mac-1 antigen. By contrast, in uninduced C10 cells, both actin and CD19 antigen were symmetrically distributed around the cell periphery (Figure 2B). Activated macrophages are highly phagocytic and respond to incoming bacterial pathogens with cytokine production and inflammation (Gordon and Taylor, 2005Gordon S. Taylor P.R. Monocyte and macrophage heterogeneity.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (3824) Google Scholar). To test whether the reprogrammed cells acquire these properties, C10 cells were induced for 3 days and tested. They indeed show high phagocytic activity when incubated with fluorescently labeled E. coli, whereas uninduced cells were essentially negative (Figures 3A–3C). Then, induced cells were treated with LPS or kept unstimulated. As shown by the qRT-PCR results in Figure 3D, they responded with a 30- to 1000-fold increased expression of RNAs encoding TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and Ccl3 (Mip1α). The data also show that for some of these markers (IL-1β and Ccl3), the induced cells already expressed elevated levels before LPS stimulation. Next, we performed time-lapse experiments to observe the onset of the transition between B cells and macrophage-like cells after activation of C/EBPα. Recordings were made at 6 min intervals for 55 hr. Movie S1 shows that cells became irregular in shape, produced membrane extensions, and moved rapidly in different directions with time. Although most of the cells changed within 24 hr of β-estradiol treatment, some cells already changed within 10 hr. To visualize these changes, stacks of images captured at different time intervals were superimposed. Figure 3E shows that the picture with the stack of superimposed images corresponding to the 5 to 6 hr interval (bottom) closely resembled the first image of the stack (top), i.e., showing little motility of the cells in this time frame. In contrast, the stack acquired at the 15 to 16 hr interval showed extensive cell movements (multiple images of the same cells in different positions) that increased further at the 24–25 and 48–49 hr intervals. The kinetics of Figure 3F shows that the cells' migratory activity increased about 8-fold between 10 and 35 hr, after which it reached a plateau. Single-cell trackings of individual cells (n = 13) showed that the onset of increased migratory activity occurred rather abruptly at intervals between 10 and 27 hr after inducer treatment (Figure S3). These trackings also permitted calculating migratory activity, which was 0.26 ± 0.03 μm/min during the more sessile phase and 1.18 ± 0.52 μm/min during the highly migratory phase. HAFTL cells, kept with or without β-estradiol, were essentially sessile. We also performed time-lapse imaging experiments with 3-day induced cells. As can be seen in Figure 3G and Movie S2, 72-hr induced cells exhibited membrane extensions with high ruffling activity characteristic of macrophages. A hallmark of transcription factor-induced cell reprogramming is that the newly established cell phenotype becomes independent of the inducing agent at a certain time after induction. To test whether this is also the case for C10 cells, they were treated between 6 and 72 hr with β-estradiol, thoroughly washed, and then cultured in absence of the inducer (Figure 4A). FACS analyses at day 5 showed that after a 48 hr or longer induction, essentially all cells had stably upregulated Mac-1 and downregulated CD19. In contrast, after a 6 hr pulse neither of the two antigens showed substantial changes whereas at intermediate induction times (12 and 24 hr), most cells expressed Mac-1 but only some had downregulated CD19. Differences were also seen in cell parameter changes: whereas a 24 hr pulse was sufficient to cause an increase in cell granularity, a 48 hr pulse was required to induce an increase in cell volume (Figure S4). To rule out the possibility that C10 cells treated for 24 and 48 hr eventually do revert their phenotype, they were tested 10 days after induction, together with untreated, 6 hr treated, and continuously treated cells as controls. As shown in Figure 4C, almost all 48 hr treated cells were Mac-1+CD19lo cells, resembling the continuously treated cells. In contrast, 24 hr pulsed cells contained similar proportions of B cells and macrophages, whereas a 6 hr pulse is below the threshold required to induce commitment. However, the latter cells transiently activated Mac-1, without downregulating CD19, before restoring the original B cell phenotype. In addition, they showed a transient increase in granularity and cell size (Figure 4B; Figure S5). These findings show that although a 24 to 48 hr treatment with estradiol induces transgene independence, a 6 hr pulse is not sufficient but induces transient differentiation. To better understand the B cell to macrophage reprogramming mechanisms, we next analyzed the changes in global gene expression. C10 cells were treated for different times with β-estradiol, their RNA extracted and microarray analyses performed, with Affymetrix chips that detect 45,101 probes, corresponding to approximately 24,600 genes. The data obtained were first plotted as the cumulative number of genes that changed at least 2-fold compared to the 0 hr control cells. Within 3 hr 1038 genes became upregulated and 1401 downregulated, and within 48 hr a total of 4468 genes changed (Figure S6A). Genes that changed during reprogramming across all time points were subjected to unsupervised hierarchical clustering, generating an expression tree that showed the expected relationships between the different time points (Figure S6B). We then arrayed the genes in this tree in a horizontal fashion, providing an overview over the gene expression changes (Figure 5A). Four groups of genes could be discerned: (1) upregulated genes, (2) downregulated genes, (3) genes that first became up- and then downregulated, and (4) genes that were first down- and then upregulated. Analysis of the kinetics of genes encoding known macrophage and B cell functions supported the prediction that they are contained in groups 1 and 2, respectively. We also verified that these genes differed accordingly between two sets of control arrays: primary pre-B cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages on the one hand, and the pre-B cell line HAFTL and the macrophage line RAW 264.7 on the other. Among the upregulated macrophage-associated genes were lysozyme (lyzs), CSF-1 receptor (csf1r), macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (msr1), Fc gamma receptor 1 (fcgr1), and Mac-1 (itgam) (Figure 5B; Table S1). Furthermore, we found toll receptors (tlr2, cd14); the scavenger receptor/phagocytosis gene cd36; interferon response genes (ifitm3, ifitm6); chemokines and chemokine receptors (ccl9, ccr1); lysosomal proteins (ctsb); metalloproteinases (mmp12, mmp13); inflammatory response genes (il6, il1b, and ccl3); and cyclooxygenase 2 (ptgs2) among the upregulated genes (Table S1 and Figure S7). Many of these genes are known to be direct targets of C/EBPα, PU.1, and Pax5 (Table S1). The downregulated B cell lineage-associated genes included the recombination activation genes rag1 and rag2 as well as several members of the B cell receptor complex, cd79a, ighg, and vpreb1 (Figure 5B; Table S1). In addition, they included genes involved in cell adhesion (slamf6 and cxcr4) and cytokine binding (il7r), which have been described as Pax5 targets (Pridans et al., 2008Pridans C. Holmes M.L. Polli M. Wettenhall J.M. Dakic A. Corcoran L.M. Smyth G.K. Nutt S.L. Identification of Pax5 target genes in early B cell differentiation.J.

The downregulation of rag1 and the upregulation of lysozyme and CSF-1 receptor genes were verified by qRT-PCR (Figure 5C). Some genes changed without showing significant differences between control B cells and macrophages. Among the downregulated genes, many were found to be involved in cell cycle control whereas the upregulated genes included seven members of the schlafen family, associated with growth arrest (Brady et al., 2005Brady G. Boggan L. Bowie A. O'Neill L.A. Schlafen-1 causes a cell cycle arrest by inhibiting induction of cyclin D1.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30723-30734Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). An Ingenuity software analysis of the genes with more complex regulation revealed that group 3 genes were broadly enriched for functions involved in inflammatory response, cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, antigen presentation, cellular development, and cell-cell interaction (p values between 10−11 and 10−8). Group 4 genes showed a strong enrichment for cell cycle, DNA replication, recombination and repair, RNA posttranscriptional modification, cellular assembly and organization, and cell-mediated immune response (p values from 10−47 to 10−8). No change was seen in the expression of progenitor genes such as Kit and Sca-1. We also tested for the requirement of protein synthesis of the differentiation-associated genes (groups 1 and 2). Of 10 genes tested that became down- or upregulated within 3 hr, 8 changed even in the presence of cycloheximide (cd79b, cxcr4, il7r, cd14, fcgr1, ptgs2, ifitm6, and csf1r) (Figure S8), suggesting that they are direct targets of either Pax5 or the C/EBPα-PU.1 complex, whereas csf2r2a and msr1 are probably regulated by a downstream effector. The changes observed in the cell line resembled the changes induced in primary pre-B cells infected with C/EBPαER and induced with estradiol, except that the latter were slightly slower (Figure 5D). Finally, we also performed a chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses of histone modification kinetics of the promoter of a characteristic macrophage gene (itgam, Mac-1) and a B cell gene (rag1). The two genes showed the expected changes over time in the activation mark H3K4me3 and the repression mark H3K27 (Figures S9A and S9B). To determine the changes in regulatory networks of B cells and macrophages, we analyzed our expression database for key transcription factors controlling these two lineages. Four groups of factors became upregulated (Figure 6 and Table 1A). (1) Genes directly regulated by PU.1 including sfpi1 (PU.1) itself, which is also regulated by C/EBPα (Friedman, 2007Friedman A.D. Transcriptional control of granulocyte and monocyte development.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6816-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), as well as id2, klf7, nab2, and gfi1. Gfi-1 is also a target gene of C/EBPα (Weigelt et al., 2008Weigelt K. Moehle C. Stempfl T. Weber B. Langmann T.

It first became up- and then downregulated as nab2 became upregulated. Nab2 is an antagonist of Gfi-1 that represses granulocyte fate and specifies macrophages (Laslo et al., 2006Laslo P.

(2) C/EBP family members. As shown in Figure 6B, cebpb and cebpd became upregulated while cebpg was slightly downregulated. C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are known to have roles in myelomonocytic cell function and development (Friedman, 2007Friedman A.D. Transcriptional control of granulocyte and monocyte development.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6816-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) whereas C/EBPγ is a dominant-negative inhibitor of the other family members (Cooper et al., 1995Cooper C. Henderson A. Artandi S. Avitahl N. Calame K.

Surprisingly, cebpa remained silent within the time frame tested and became upregulated only between 4 and 5 days after induction of C10 cells (data not shown). (3) AP-1 family members jun, junb, fos, and fosl2 (Figure 6C). These factors are capable of regulating myeloid genes by forming heterodimers with C/EBPα (Cai et al., 2008Cai D.H. Wang D. Keefer J. Yeamans C. Hensley K. Friedman A.D. C/EBP alpha:AP-1 leucine zipper heterodimers bind novel DNA elements, activate the PU.1 promoter and direct monocyte lineage commitment more potently than C/EBP alpha homodimers or AP-1.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2772-2779Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). (4) Candidate macrophage regulators ets2, mef2a, mitf, rbpj, nfil3, and tcfec (Table 1A; Figure S10A). Changes in expression of selected transcription factor genes (sfpi1, gfi1, cebpb, cebpd, and mitf) were also tested by qRT-PCR in 3 hr stimulated cells, with and without cycloheximide.

Asterisks denote genes for which several Affymetrix probes showed similar behavior. Another four groups of genes became downregulated and showed differences in expression consistent with those seen with the B cell and macrophage control sets (Table 1B). (1) Genes encoding the B cell master regulators Pax5, EBF, and E2A became downregulated more than 2-fold already within 3 hr after induction (Figure 6D). This probably reflects the fact that C/EBPα directly inhibits Pax5 (Xie et al., 2004Xie H. Ye M. Feng R. Graf T.

https://openalex.org/W2045908070,"Both phenotypic plasticity and genetic determination can be important for understanding how plants respond to environmental change. However, little is known about the plastic response of leaf teeth and leaf dissection to temperature. This gap is critical because these leaf traits are commonly used to reconstruct paleoclimate from fossils, and such studies tacitly assume that traits measured from fossils reflect the environment at the time of their deposition, even during periods of rapid climate change. We measured leaf size and shape in Acer rubrum derived from four seed sources with a broad temperature range and grown for two years in two gardens with contrasting climates (Rhode Island and Florida). Leaves in the Rhode Island garden have more teeth and are more highly dissected than leaves in Florida from the same seed source. Plasticity in these variables accounts for at least 6-19% of the total variance, while genetic differences among ecotypes probably account for at most 69-87%. This study highlights the role of phenotypic plasticity in leaf-climate relationships. We suggest that variables related to tooth count and leaf dissection in A. rubrum can respond quickly to climate change, which increases confidence in paleoclimate methods that use these variables."

However, the types of cells most effective for treating SCI have not been clarified. Taking advantage of our recently established neurosphere-based culture system of ES cell-derived NS/PCs, in which primary neurospheres (PNS) and passaged secondary neurospheres (SNS) exhibit neurogenic and gliogenic potentials, respectively, here we examined the distinct effects of transplanting neurogenic and gliogenic NS/PCs on the functional recovery of a mouse model of SCI. ES cell-derived PNS and SNS transplanted 9 days after contusive injury at the Th10 level exhibited neurogenic and gliogenic differentiation tendencies, respectively, similar to those seen in vitro. Interestingly, transplantation of the gliogenic SNS, but not the neurogenic PNS, promoted axonal growth, remyelination, and angiogenesis, and resulted in significant locomotor functional recovery after SCI. These findings suggest that gliogenic NS/PCs are effective for promoting the recovery from SCI, and provide essential insight into the mechanisms through which cellular transplantation leads to functional improvement after SCI."
https://openalex.org/W2011669145,"Antioxidants cause stabilization and nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), where it binds to the antioxidant response element (ARE) and induces up-regulation of defensive genes that protect cells against oxidative and electrophilic stress. Bach1, the negative regulator of Nrf2, competes with Nrf2 for binding to the ARE in the human NQO1 promoter. In this study, we demonstrate that Bach1 exits the nucleus within 1-2 h upon antioxidant treatment. Genistein, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinases, blocked nuclear export of Bach1. Site-directed mutagenesis and immunoprecipitation assays identified tyrosine 486 that was phosphorylated in response to the antioxidant and was essential for nuclear export of Bach1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a competitive interplay between Bach1 and Nrf2 at 1-2 and 4 h for binding to the human NQO1 ARE. Luciferase and real time PCR assays showed a significant decrease in antioxidant induction of reporter activity and mRNA levels in cells transfected with mutant Bach1 compared with wild type. This decrease was due to the absence of nuclear export of the mutant protein. Bach1 levels inside the nucleus returned to normal at 4 h after antioxidant treatment in the absence but not in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. In addition, antioxidant treatment increased the transcription of Bach1 as shown by pulse chase and real time PCR experiments. Taken together, these results indicate that increased synthesis of Bach1 restored its nuclear levels to normal at 4 h. In conclusion, antioxidant-induced tyrosine 486 phosphorylation leads to nuclear exit of Bach1, thus allowing Nrf2 access to the ARE."
https://openalex.org/W2164405370,"Background The methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone USA300 contains a novel mobile genetic element, arginine catabolic mobile element (ACME), that contributes to its enhanced capacity to grow and survive within the host. Although ACME appears to have been transferred into USA300 from S. epidermidis, the genetic diversity of ACME in the latter species remains poorly characterized. Methodology/Principal Findings To assess the prevalence and genetic diversity of ACME, 127 geographically diverse S. epidermidis isolates representing 86 different multilocus sequence types (STs) were characterized. ACME was found in 51% (65/127) of S. epidermidis isolates. The vast majority (57/65) of ACME-containing isolates belonged to the predominant S. epidermidis clonal complex CC2. ACME was often found in association with different allotypes of staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec (SCCmec) which also encodes the recombinase function that facilities mobilization ACME from the S. epidermidis chromosome. Restriction fragment length polymorphism, PCR scanning and DNA sequencing allowed for identification of 39 distinct ACME genetic variants that differ from one another in gene content, thereby revealing a hitherto uncharacterized genetic diversity within ACME. All but one ACME variants were represented by a single S. epidermidis isolate; the singular variant, termed ACME-I.02, was found in 27 isolates, all of which belonged to the CC2 lineage. An evolutionary model constructed based on the eBURST algorithm revealed that ACME-I.02 was acquired at least on 15 different occasions by strains belonging to the CC2 lineage. Conclusions/Significance ACME-I.02 in diverse S. epidermidis isolates were nearly identical in sequence to the prototypical ACME found in USA300 MRSA clone, providing further evidence for the interspecies transfer of ACME from S. epidermidis into USA300."

FM19G11 inhibits at nanomolar range the transcriptional and protein expression of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Tgf-alpha undifferentiating factors, in adult rat and human embryonic stem cells, FM19G11 activity occurs in ependymal progenitor stem cells from rats (epSPC), a cell model reported for spinal cord regeneration, which allows the progression of oligodendrocyte cell differentiation in a hypoxic environment, has created interest in its characterization for pharmacological research. Experiments using small interfering RNA showed a significant depletion in Sox2 protein only in the case of HIF2alpha silencing, but not in HIF1alpha-mediated ablation. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation data, together with the significant presence of functional hypoxia response element consensus sequences in the promoter region of Sox2, strongly validated that this factor behaves as a target gene of HIF2alpha in epSPCs. FM19G11 causes a reduction of overall histone acetylation with significant repression of p300, a histone acetyltransferase required as a co-factor for HIF-transcription activation. Arrays carried out in the presence and absence of the inhibitor showed the predominant involvement of epigenetic-associated events mediated by the drug."
https://openalex.org/W2063205059,"Background The recent emergence of a novel pandemic influenza A(H1N1) strain in humans exemplifies the rapid and unpredictable nature of influenza virus evolution and the need for effective therapeutics and vaccines to control such outbreaks. However, resistance to antivirals can be a formidable problem as evidenced by the currently widespread oseltamivir- and adamantane-resistant seasonal influenza A viruses (IFV). Additional antiviral approaches with novel mechanisms of action are needed to combat novel and resistant influenza strains. DAS181 (Fludase™) is a sialidase fusion protein in early clinical development with in vitro and in vivo preclinical activity against a variety of seasonal influenza strains and highly pathogenic avian influenza strains (A/H5N1). Here, we use in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models to evaluate the activity of DAS181 against several pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses. Methods and Findings The activity of DAS181 against several pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus isolates was examined in MDCK cells, differentiated primary human respiratory tract culture, ex-vivo human bronchi tissue and mice. DAS181 efficiently inhibited viral replication in each of these models and against all tested pandemic influenza A(H1N1) strains. DAS181 treatment also protected mice from pandemic influenza A(H1N1)-induced pathogenesis. Furthermore, DAS181 antiviral activity against pandemic influenza A(H1N1) strains was comparable to that observed against seasonal influenza virus including the H274Y oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus. Conclusions The sialidase fusion protein DAS181 exhibits potent inhibitory activity against pandemic influenza A(H1N1) viruses. As inhibition was also observed with oseltamivir-resistant IFV (H274Y), DAS181 may be active against the antigenically novel pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus should it acquire the H274Y mutation. Based on these and previous results demonstrating DAS181 broad-spectrum anti-IFV activity, DAS181 represents a potential therapeutic agent for prevention and treatment of infections by both emerging and seasonal strains of IFV."
https://openalex.org/W2136625447,"Chronic Helicobacter pylori infection is known to be associated with the development of peptic ulcer, gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma. Currently, the bacterial factors of H. pylori are reported to be important in the development of gastroduodenal diseases. CagA protein, encoded by the cagA, is the best studied virulence factor of H. pylori. The pathogenic CagA protein contains a highly polymorphic Glu-Pro-Ile-Tyr-Ala (EPIYA) repeat region in the C-terminal. This repeat region is reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases. The segments containing EPIYA motifs have been designated as segments A, B, C, and D; however the classification and disease relation are still unclear. This study used 560 unique CagA sequences containing 1,796 EPIYA motifs collected from public resources, including 274 Western and 286 East Asian strains with clinical data obtained from 433 entries. Fifteen types of EPIYA or EPIYA-like sequences are defined. In addition to four previously reported major segment types, several minor segment types (e.g., segment B', B'') and more than 30 sequence types (e.g., ABC, ABD) were defined using our classification method. We confirm that the sequences from Western and East Asian strains contain segment C and D, respectively. We also confirm that strains with two EPIYA segment C have a greater chance of developing gastric cancer than those with one segment C. Our results shed light on the relationships between the types of CagAs, the country of origin of each sequence type, and the frequency of gastric disease."
https://openalex.org/W1975386329,"Claudins are identified as members of the tetraspanin family of proteins, which are integral to the structure and function of tight junction. Recent studies showed an increase in expression of claudins during tumorigenesis, which is associated with loss of cell-cell contact, dedifferentiation, and invasiveness. However, the molecular basis for the causal relationship between claudin expression and cancer progression is not fully understood yet. In this study, we show that claudin-1 plays a causal role in the acquisition of invasive capacity in human liver cells and that c-Abl-protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) signaling is critical for the malignant progression induced by claudin-1. Overexpression of claudin-1 clearly induced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and cell invasion and migration in normal liver cells as well as in non-invasive human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Conversely, small interfering RNA targeting of claudin-1 in invasive HCC cells completely inhibited cell invasion. Both c-Abl and PKCdelta are found to be activated in normal liver cell line clones that stably overexpress claudin-1. Inhibition of either c-Abl or PKCdelta alone clearly attenuated MMP-2 activation and impeded cell invasion and migration in both human HCC and normal liver cells expressing claudin-1. These results indicate that claudin-1 is both necessary and sufficient to induce invasive behavior in human liver cells and that activation of c-Abl-PKCdelta signaling pathway is critically required for the claudin-1-induced acquisition of the malignant phenotype. The present observations raise the possibility of exploiting claudin-1 as a potential biomarker for the spread of liver cancer and might provide pivotal points for therapeutic intervention in HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2023205512,"Postmenopausal estrogen depletion is a characterized risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD), a human disorder linked to high levels of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in brain tissue. Previous studies suggest that estrogen negatively regulates the level of Abeta in the brain, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. Here, we provide evidence that estrogen promotes Abeta degradation mainly through a principal Abeta degrading enzyme, neprilysin, in neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We also demonstrate that up-regulation of neprilysin by estrogen is dependent on both estrogen receptor alpha and beta (ERalpha and ERbeta), and ligand-activated ER regulates expression of neprilysin through physical interactions between ER and estrogen response elements (EREs) identified in the neprilysin gene. These results were confirmed by in vitro gel shift and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, which demonstrate specific binding of ERalpha and ERbeta to two putative EREs in the neprilysin gene. The EREs also enhance ERalpha- and ERbeta-dependent reporter gene expression in a yeast model system. Therefore, the study described here provides a putative mechanism by which estrogen positively regulates expression of neprilysin to promote degradation of Abeta, reducing risk for AD. These results may lead to novel approaches to prevent or treat AD."
https://openalex.org/W2087582990,"Background Increased access to HIV testing is essential in working towards universal access to HIV prevention and treatment in resource-limited countries. We here evaluated currently used HIV diagnostic tests and algorithms in Cameroon for their ability to correctly identify HIV infections. Methods We estimated sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 5 rapid/simple tests, of which 3 were used by the national program, and 2 fourth generation ELISAs. The reference panel included 500 locally collected samples; 187 HIV -1 M, 10 HIV-1 O, 259 HIV negative and 44 HIV indeterminate plasmas. Results None of the 5 rapid assays and only 1 ELISA reached the current WHO/UNAIDS recommendations on performance of HIV tests of at least 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity. Overall, sensitivities ranged between 94.1% and 100%, while specificities were 88.0% to 98.8%. The combination of all assays generated up to 9% of samples with indeterminate HIV status, because they reacted discordantly with at least one of the different tests. Including HIV indeterminate samples in test efficiency calculations significantly decreased specificities to a range from 77.9% to 98.0%. Finally, two rapid assays failed to detect all HIV-1 group O variants tested, with one rapid test detecting only 2 out of 10 group O specimens. Conclusion In the era of ART scaling-up in Africa, significant proportions of false positive but also false negative results are still observed with HIV screening tests commonly used in Africa, resulting in inadequate treatment and prevention strategies. Depending on tests or algorithms used, up to 6% of HIV-1 M and 80% of HIV-1 O infected patients in Cameroon do not receive ART and adequate counseling to prevent further transmission due to low sensitivities. Also, the use of tests with low specificities could imply inclusion of up to 12% HIV negative people in ART programs and increase budgets in addition to inconveniences caused to patients."
https://openalex.org/W2007116043,"Background Chlamydia trachomatis is a major human pathogen with a unique obligate intracellular developmental cycle that takes place inside a modified cytoplasmic structure known as an inclusion. Following entry into a cell, the infectious elementary body (EB) differentiates into a non - infectious replicative form known as a reticulate body (RB). RBs divide by binary fission and at the end of the cycle they redifferentiate into EBs. Treatment of C.trachomatis with penicillin prevents maturation of RBs which survive and enlarge to become aberrant RBs within the inclusion in a non - infective persistent state. Persistently infected individuals may be a reservoir for chlamydial infection. The C.trachomatis genome encodes the enzymes for peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis but a PG sacculus has never been detected. This coupled to the action of penicillin is known as the chlamydial anomaly. We have applied video microscopy and quantitative DNA assays to the chlamydial developmental cycle to assess the effects of penicillin treatment and establish a framework for investigating penicillin induced chlamydial persistence. Principal Findings Addition of penicillin at the time of cell infection does not prevent uptake and the establishment of an inclusion. EB to RB transition occurs but bacterial cytokinesis is arrested by the second binary fission. RBs continue to enlarge but not divide in the presence of penicillin. The normal developmental cycle can be recovered by the removal of penicillin although the large, aberrant RBs do not revert to the normal smaller size but remain present to the completion of the developmental cycle. Chromosomal and plasmid DNA replication is unaffected by the addition of penicillin but the arrest of bacterial cytokinesis under these conditions results in RBs accumulating multiple copies of the genome. Conclusions We have applied video time lapse microscopy to the study of the chlamydial developmental cycle. Linked with accurate measures of genome replication this provides a defined framework to analyse the developmental cycle and to investigate and provide new insights into the effects of antibiotic treatments. Removal of penicillin allows recovery of the normal developmental cycle by 10–20 hrs and the process occurs by budding from aberrant RBs."
https://openalex.org/W2048904628,"In semen, proteolytic peptide fragments from prostatic acid phosphatase can form amyloid fibrils termed SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of viral infection). These fibrils greatly enhance human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectivity by increasing the attachment of virions to target cells. Therefore, SEVI may have a significant impact on whether HIV is successfully transmitted during sexual contact. Here, we demonstrate that surfen, a small molecule heparan sulfate proteoglycan antagonist, inhibits both SEVI- and semen-mediated enhancement of HIV type 1 infection. Surfen interferes with the binding of SEVI to both target cells and HIV type 1 virions but does not deaggregate SEVI fibrils.

Fractionation of semen from healthy donors led to the identification of a factor that can enhance HIV infection up to 105-fold in cell culture when viral inocula are limiting. This factor, termed SEVI (semen-derived enhancer of viral infection), corresponds to amyloid fibrils composed of internal 34–40 amino acid proteolytic fragments from prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), a protein present at a concentration of ∼1–2 mg/ml in semen (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C.

The positively charged SEVI fibrils bind to both target cells and HIV virions and augment infection by increasing physical contact between these two components (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L.

Virology. 1969; 38: 414-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although we demonstrated that the cationic nature of SEVI is important for its pro-attachment effects (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the surface components of target cells that interact with SEVI remained unknown. We previously observed that anionic polymers, such as heparin sulfate, interfere with the binding of SEVI to target cells (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that the fibrils may bind target cells by interacting with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), naturally occurring anionic carbohydrate polymers that are closely related in structure to heparin sulfate. We therefore sought to examine whether antagonists of HSPG might inhibit the viral enhancing activity of SEVI. Bis-2-methyl-4-amino-quinolyl-6-carbamide (surfen), a recently identified small molecule antagonist of HSPG, represented an intriguing candidate. First described in 1938 (5Umber F. Stoerring F.K.

We now report that surfen counteracts SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 fusion to and infection of host cells. Surfen not only antagonizes the interaction between SEVI- and HSPG-expressing target cells but also between SEVI and HIV-1 virions. Importantly, we observed that surfen also inhibits the ability of semen to enhance HIV-1 infection. Incorporation of surfen or surfen-like compounds, which target semen-derived viral enhancement factors, should be considered in the development of HIV microbicides, provided these compounds can be safely used. 293T and TZM-bl cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The CHO and pgs-A745 stable transfectants (a gift from P. Bieniasz, Aaron Diamond Center, New York) were cultured in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). Primary CD4+ T cells were isolated from buffy coats by Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation, followed by negative selection with CD14+ microbeads and positive selection with CD4+ microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec). Synthetic PAP-(248–286) (ViroPharmaceuticals) and N-terminally FITC-labeled PAP-(248–286) (GenScript) were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and converted into SEVI amyloid fibrils by overnight agitation at 37 °C at 1,400 rpm using an Eppendorf Thermomixer. Pooled semen (obtained from the University of California, San Francisco, Fertility Clinic) was divided into aliquots and frozen at −20 °C. β-Lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr) chimeric CCR5-tropic 81A viruses used in the fusion assays were produced by FuGENE-mediated transfection of 293T cells with DNA proviral expression plasmids as described (9Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). CCR5-tropic 81A viruses used in the TZM-bl infectivity assays were produced by transfecting 293T cells with a DNA proviral expression plasmid. Luciferase-expressing viruses used in the CHO/pgs-A745 infectivity assays were produced by transfecting 293T cells with DNA plasmid pNL4–3.Luc.R-E- pseudotyped with 92HT599.24 (a dual-tropic subtype B envelope). Two days after transfection, supernatants were clarified by sedimentation and titered for p24Gag content by anti-p24Gag enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), phycoerythrin, or allophycocyanin-conjugated antibodies specific for CD3, CD4, and CCR5 were purchased from BD Biosciences. Anti-heparan sulfate antibody (10E4 epitope) was obtained from Weikagaku Biobusiness Corp. and was stained with a secondary rat anti-mouse IgM (BD Biosciences). Cells were analyzed on a BD FACSCalibur and analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). Virion fusion was performed similar to methods described (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J.

Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). For target cell pretreatment with SEVI, 5 × 105 CD14−CD4+ cells were pretreated with SEVI (31.25 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated concentration of surfen (obtained from the Open Chemical Repository in the Developmental Therapeutic Program at the NCI, National Institutes of Health (NSC12155) and stored in DMSO at a concentration of 30 mm). Where indicated, chloroquine (Sigma) was added as a structurally related but inactive surfen control. A SEVI concentration of 31.25 μg/ml was chosen because similar quantities of fibril-forming PAP fragments have been isolated from semen, suggesting that this concentration may be physiologically relevant (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C.

After pretreatment, cells were washed twice with medium and added to β-lactamase-containing 81A virions (200 ng/ml p24Gag). Alternatively, for virion pretreatment with SEVI, 81A virions (200 ng/ml p24Gag) were pretreated with SEVI (31.25 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of the indicated concentration of surfen and then added to 5 × 105 CD14−CD4+ target cells. In all instances, viral fusion was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 37 °C, after which the cells were loaded overnight with CCF2, a fluorescent substrate of β-lactamase. Cells were then stained with surface antibodies, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer. Flow cytometric data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar). For infection of TZM-bl cells, CCR5-tropic HIV-1 (20 ng/ml p24Gag) was pretreated for 5 min with diluted SEVI or semen in the presence or absence of surfen. Where indicated, chloroquine was added as a structurally related but inactive surfen control. Pretreated virions (20 μl) were added to TZM-bl cells (104/well in 96-well flat bottom plates) in 280 μl of medium. To minimize toxic effects mediated by prolonged exposure of semen to target cells (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A.

Infection was assayed 3 days later by quantitating β-galactosidase activity with a Gal-Screen kit (Applied Biosystems). Background signals obtained from uninfected cells were subtracted from values obtained from infected cells. For infection of CHO and pgs-A745 cells, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 (10 ng/ml p24Gag) was pretreated for 5 min with the indicated concentration of SEVI. Surfen was added where appropriate. Pretreated virions (20 μl) were then added to CHO or pgs-A745 transfectants (4 × 103/well in 96-well flat bottom plates) in 280 μl of medium. Medium was replaced after 2 h, and infection was assayed 3 days later by measuring luciferase activity (Promega). TZM-bl cells (104/well) were treated with semen in the presence or absence of surfen. A semen concentration of 3.3% was used, as this corresponds to the 50% semen pretreatment concentration that was used in the infectivity assays (because upon infection of target cells, the 50% semen solution was diluted 15-fold to give a final concentration of 50/15 = 3.3%). Medium was replaced after 2 h, and viability was measured 3 days later using the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega). As a positive control for cytotoxicity, cells were treated with the same concentration of semen for 3 days without medium replacement and then assayed for viability. FITC-labeled SEVI (20 μg/ml) was pretreated with the indicated concentration of surfen or chloroquine for 30 min and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2.5 × 104 TZM-bl cells seeded in an 8-well LabTek chamber (Nunc). Cells were washed three times prior to imaging with a laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica CS SP5) using an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and a ×20 air objective. These studies were performed at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Image analysis was performed using Volocity (Improvision) or Zeiss image processing software. 81A virions (100 ng/ml p24Gag) were incubated with SEVI (50 μg/ml) in the presence of the indicated concentrations of surfen for 3 h at 37 °C. The fibrils were then collected by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min, and HIV-1 content in the supernatant and pellet was assayed by anti-p24Gag ELISA (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To assess a potential direct interaction between SEVI and surfen, SEVI (50 μg/ml) was pretreated with the indicated concentrations of surfen for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were subsequently centrifuged and washed twice. SEVI fibrils were then pelleted and resuspended with HIV-1 virions (100 ng/ml p24Gag) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Finally, samples were centrifuged, and HIV-1 levels in the supernatant and pellet were determined by anti-p24Gag ELISA as described above. Results are reported as the fraction of p24Gag pelleted by the fibrils relative to input (defined as the cumulative amount of p24Gag in the supernatant and pellet). SEVI (5 mg/ml) was agitated with the indicated concentration of surfen at 1,400 rpm for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were then diluted to 250 μg/ml SEVI, and thioflavin T (Sigma) was added at final concentration of 5 μm. Changes in fluorescence (excitation 440 nm, emission 482 nm) resulting from SEVI amyloid fibrils binding to thioflavin T were assayed in triplicate using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Ls-5B luminescence spectrometer. SEVI (0.5 mg/ml) was incubated with 10, 50, or 100 μm surfen, or the equivalent amount of DMSO, for 3 h at 37 °C. Fibrils were then collected by centrifugation, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 50 μl of phosphate-buffered saline for electron microscopy. Samples were prepared for imaging as described (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that pretreatment of target cells with SEVI enhances their fusion to HIV-1 virions (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). This enhancement may be mediated by the interaction of the anionic surface of HSPG on the cells with the cationic surface of SEVI, as treatment of SEVI with anionic polymers such as heparin sulfate abrogates the SEVI enhancement (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Because surfen (Fig. 1A) was recently reported to be an antagonist of HSPG (8Schuksz M. Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Ditto D.P. Lawrence R. Glass C.A. Wang L. Tor Y. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we tested whether it would interfere with the ability of SEVI to enhance HIV-1 virion fusion to primary CD4+ T cells using a fusion assay developed by our laboratory (9Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells were pretreated with SEVI in the absence or presence of surfen and then incubated with β-lactamase-Vpr (BlaM-Vpr)-expressing CCR5-tropic 81A virions. We utilized CCR5-tropic virions in our studies because sexual transmission of HIV-1 occurs predominantly with the CCR5-tropic HIV-1 variants. Fusion was measured by the spectral shift of cleaved CCF2, a fluorescent substrate of β-lactamase. Consistent with previous results (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), we found that in the absence of surfen, addition of SEVI enhanced fusion of HIV-1 to CD4+ cells by more than 6-fold. However, if the cells were pretreated with 50 μm surfen prior to the addition of SEVI, only a 1.4-fold increase in fusion was observed (Fig. 1B). These effects of surfen appeared specific because pretreatment of cells with the structurally related chloroquine, another aminoquinoline, did not inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 fusion. Surfen induced a dose-dependent inhibition of SEVI action at concentrations greater than 6.25 μm with a maximal inhibitory plateau occurring at 50–100 μm (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 1). Of note, when surfen was added to cells in the absence of SEVI, HIV-1 fusion was not inhibited (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. 1), suggesting that surfen was acting directly on SEVI and not compromising the infectivity of the HIV-1 virions. To further investigate the effect of surfen on the interaction between SEVI and the virions, we incubated 81A virions simultaneously with SEVI and increasing concentrations of surfen, and we then infected target cells with these treated virions. Similar to the results obtained when surfen was added during SEVI pretreatment of target cells, addition of surfen to SEVI during virion pretreatment also inhibited SEVI enhancement activity (supplemental Fig. 2). Higher concentrations of surfen were necessary for inhibition in the target cell pretreatment experiment, likely because the treated cells were washed, thereby removing unbound surfen before exposure to HIV-1 virions. Next, we tested whether SEVI-mediated enhancement of productive HIV-1 infection is also inhibited by surfen. We added SEVI to HIV-1 virions in the presence or absence of surfen and then diluted the SEVI-treated viral particles 15-fold before adding them to TZM-bl cells, a reporter cell line that expresses β-galactosidase under a Tat-inducible promoter (10Platt E.J.

Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), addition of SEVI to HIV-1 81A virions enhanced viral infection in a dose-dependent manner; pretreating virions with 50 μg/ml SEVI, the highest concentration tested, increased infection 13.2-fold, whereas lower concentrations of SEVI induced lower levels of enhancement (Fig. 2A, columns on the far left). If the SEVI-exposed virions were treated with surfen at a final concentration of 3.3 or 6.7 μm, enhancement of HIV infection was almost completely abolished at all concentrations of SEVI that were tested (Fig. 2A). Intermediate effects were obtained when surfen was added at a final concentration of 0.67 μm. Surfen also inhibited the enhancement of infection obtained when target cells rather than virions were pretreated with SEVI (data not shown). To examine the effect of surfen in a more physiological context, we next tested whether surfen similarly blocks semen-mediated enhancement of viral infection. For these studies, we pretreated the HIV-1 virions with the indicated concentrations of semen with or without surfen. Target cells were then exposed to the pretreated virions for 2 h, after which the medium was replaced and infection was allowed to proceed for 3 days. In the absence of surfen, semen enhanced HIV-1 infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2B, columns on the far left). In agreement with published results, a sharp decrease in semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infectivity was observed with 50% semen due to toxic effects on the cells (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C. Margolis L. Keppler O.T. Forssmann W.G. Kirchhoff F. Cell. 2007; 131: 1059-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Similar to its effects on synthetic SEVI, surfen also inhibited semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. Final surfen concentrations of 3.3 or 6.7 μm decreased maximal enhancement activity from almost 16- to ∼4-fold, whereas a final surfen concentration of 0.67 μm modestly inhibited semen enhancement (Fig. 2B). As a specificity control, we further demonstrated that in contrast to surfen, chloroquine did not efficiently block SEVI- or semen-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection (Fig. 2C and data not shown). Prolonged in vitro exposure to high levels of semen results in cell death (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C. Margolis L. Keppler O.T. Forssmann W.G. Kirchhoff F. Cell. 2007; 131: 1059-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). To ensure that the observed inhibitory effects were not the result of high toxicity obtained when surfen is combined with semen, we examined the viability of TZM-bl cells in the presence of surfen and semen. As shown in supplemental Fig. 3, surfen did not decrease the viability of cells treated with semen under conditions used for the infectivity assays. In contrast, TZM-bl cells continuously incubated for 3 days with semen, a condition toxic to cells (1Münch J. Rücker E. Ständker L. Adermann K. Goffinet C. Schindler M. Wildum S. Chinnadurai R. Rajan D. Specht A. Giménez-Gallego G. Sánchez P.C. Fowler D.M. Koulov A. Kelly J.W. Mothes W. Grivel J.C. Margolis L. Keppler O.T. Forssmann W.G. Kirchhoff F. Cell. 2007; 131: 1059-1071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), displayed diminished cell viability. To determine whether surfen, as a reported HSPG antagonist, exerts its effect on SEVI by inhibiting the interaction of SEVI with HSPG-expressing target cells, we utilized laser scanning confocal microscopy to visualize the interaction of FITC-labeled SEVI with TZM-bl cells. In the absence of surfen, SEVI interacted extensively with the cells (Fig. 3, left panel). Conversely, when SEVI was pretreated with 100 μm surfen and subsequently incubated with target cells, SEVI binding was almost completely abolished. In the presence of 20 μm surfen, binding was partially reduced, and in the presence of 6.7 μm surfen, binding was similar to the control sample lacking surfen. In contrast to surfen, chloroquine did not diminish SEVI binding to the cells (Fig. 3; lower magnification images are presented in supplemental Fig. 4). Interestingly, the concentration of surfen necessary to inhibit the interaction of SEVI with TZM-bl cells was higher than that necessary to inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection. For example, although surfen at a final concentration of 6.7 μm was sufficient to almost completely eliminate SEVI enhancement of HIV-1 infection in TZM-bl cells (Fig. 2A), surfen at a concentration of 6.7 μm did not diminish SEVI binding to the same target cells (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4). Therefore, concentrations of surfen that impaired SEVI enhancement of viral infectivity were not sufficient to block SEVI binding to target cells, suggesting that surfen may exert its inhibition through a mechanism other than interfering with SEVI binding to HSPG on target cells. To examine whether surfen can antagonize SEVI activity independent of HSPG, we set out to determine whether SEVI can enhance HIV infection in a cell line completely devoid of cell surface HSPG, and if so whether surfen inhibits this enhancement. For these studies, we took advantage of the CHO cell line derivative pgs-A745, which does not express the enzyme xylosyltransferase and therefore lacks cell-surface HSPG (12Esko J.D. Stewart T.E. Taylor W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 3197-3201Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). We obtained CHO and pgs-A745 cells stably transfected with human CD4 and CCR5, and a Y261C mutant of cyclin T1 that can support HIV Tat function (13Zhang Y.J. Hatziioannou T. Zang T. Braaten D. Luban J. Goff S.P. Bieniasz P.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6332-6343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Comparable cell-surface expression of CD4 and CCR5 was detected in the CD4/CCR5-transfected CHO and pgs-A745 cells (data not shown). However, the CHO transfectants expressed cell-surface HSPG, but the pgs-A745 transfectants did not (Fig. 4A). To examine whether SEVI enhances HIV infection in these cells, we incubated luciferase-encoding HIV-1 in the presence or absence of SEVI and infected the CHO and pgs-A745 cells. Infection was assayed 3 days later by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. We observed that SEVI enhanced HIV infection in both the CHO and pgs-A745 cells, although the enhancing effect was more pronounced in the CHO cells (Fig. 4B, left panels). The diminished SEVI enhancing effect in the pgs-A745 cells may be the result of the decreased ability of these mutant cells to bind SEVI (supplemental Fig. 5). We then tested whether surfen inhibited SEVI enhancement activity in the CHO and pgs-A745 cells. When surfen was added to the SEVI-treated virions at a final concentration of 6.7 μm (a concentration that inhibited SEVI enhancement in the TZMbl cells (Fig. 2A)), SEVI enhancing activity was abolished in both the CHO and pgs-A745 cells (Fig. 4B, right panels). These results suggest that surfen can inhibit SEVI enhancement in a manner that is independent of cell-surface HSPG. Because surfen inhibits SEVI enhancement of HIV-1 infection in a cell line that lacks HSPG expression, the inhibitory effects of surfen are not due solely to antagonism of target cell HSPG. Since addition of surfen to SEVI during virion pretreatment inhibited SEVI enhancement activity (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. 2), we considered the possibility that the inhibitory effect of surfen was also mediated by interfering with the interaction between SEVI and HIV-1 virions. We tested whether surfen inhibits the binding of SEVI to HIV-1 using a binding assay that measures the association of SEVI fibrils with HIV-1 virions. In this assay, SEVI is incubated with HIV-1 virions and then collected by low speed centrifugation. HIV-1 virions associated with the pelleted SEVI are then quantified by p24Gag ELISA (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We observed, using this assay, that surfen inhibited the binding of HIV-1 to SEVI fibrils in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Of note, the concentrations of surfen necessary to inhibit the interaction between SEVI and virions were lower than those necessary for inhibiting the interaction between SEVI and target cells. For example, although 12.5 μm surfen was sufficient to almost completely abolish the ability of SEVI to associate with HIV-1 virions (Fig. 5A), 20 μm surfen still allowed for significant interactions between SEVI and target cells (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 4). We then tested whether surfen blocks the interaction between SEVI and HIV-1 by interacting directly with the SEVI fibrils. We pretreated SEVI fibrils with surfen to allow any interaction between the two components to occur. After washing the surfen-treated SEVI to remove any unbound surfen, we resuspended the SEVI in the presence of HIV-1 and measured the amount of fibril-associated HIV-1 after centrifugation. We found, using this two-step binding assay, that pretreating SEVI with surfen inhibited its ability to subsequently associate with HIV-1 (Fig. 5B). The concentration of surfen needed for inhibition was higher than that necessary when the HIV-1, surfen, and SEVI were all added simultaneously (Fig. 5A). This observation might be explained because, in the two-step binding assay, unbound surfen was washed out after the SEVI pretreatment, whereas in the single-step binding assay, surfen was present in the samples throughout the entire assay. A direct interaction between surfen and SEVI was further supported by the observation that SEVI fibrils could remove surfen from solution. In particular, when SEVI was added to surfen and then removed by centrifugation, a diminished level of surfen remained in the supernatant relative to a control sample in which surfen was mock-treated in the absence of SEVI (supplemental Fig. 6). To exclude the possibility that surfen interfered with the binding of SEVI to HIV-1 by deaggregating the fibrils, we examined the effect of surfen on the fibrillar state of SEVI. Adding surfen to SEVI did not affect its interaction with thioflavin T, a dye that selectively binds amyloid fibrils (Fig. 5C). Electron microscopy confirmed the presence of fibrils in SEVI samples containing surfen (Fig. 5D). Collectively, the data suggest that surfen directly binds SEVI fibrils and prevents its subsequent association with HIV-1 virions. In this study, we identify surfen as a small molecule inhibitor of SEVI enhancement activity. We examined surfen because of its reported role as an antagonist of HSPG (8Schuksz M. Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Ditto D.P. Lawrence R. Glass C.A. Wang L. Tor Y. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and our hypothesis that SEVI primarily interacts with cells by binding to cell-surface HSPG. We show here that surfen blocks the binding of SEVI to target cells. However, to our surprise, the inhibitory effect of surfen did not appear to be solely the result of antagonizing the interaction of SEVI with target cell HSPG because of the following: 1) concentrations of surfen necessary for inhibiting SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection were lower than those necessary for inhibiting SEVI binding to target cells, and 2) surfen blocked SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 infection in HSPG-deficient cells. Upon further investigation, we found that surfen interacts directly with SEVI and that surfen-laden SEVI was impaired in its ability to bind virions. We favor a model where surfen inhibits SEVI-mediated enhancement of HIV infection by blocking the interactions of SEVI with both target cells as well as the virions. The ability of surfen to directly interact with SEVI was surprising in light of the fact that both are cationic molecules and therefore would be predicted to repel one another. It is possible that hydrophobic ring stacking between the fibrils and the aminoquinoline moieties of surfen mediates this interaction. It has also been suggested that surfen can form stacked structures (8Schuksz M. Fuster M.M. Brown J.R. Crawford B.E. Ditto D.P. Lawrence R. Glass C.A. Wang L. Tor Y. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which may explain its ability to interact with the SEVI amyloid fibrils. Of note, not all aminoquinolines can inhibit SEVI-mediated enhancement of viral infection, as suggested by the lack of inhibitory activity of chloroquine. Significantly, surfen blocked the ability of semen to enhance HIV-1 infection, raising the possibility that surfen or other related compounds might prove useful as components of a multifunctional microbicide. Current HIV-1 microbicide candidates only target the activity of the virions. In the presence of SEVI or semen, these microbicides have greatly reduced potency. 3J. Münch and F. Kirchhoff, manuscript in preparation. It is logical to consider identifying compounds that not only target the virus but also host factors present in semen that enhance HIV infection. If proven safe, such a combination of microbicides might display markedly increased effectiveness. We previously demonstrated that anionic polymers, such as heparin sulfate, can block SEVI binding to both HIV-1 and target cells (3Roan N.R. Münch J. Arhel N. Mothes W. Neidleman J. Kobayashi A. Smith-McCune K. Kirchhoff F. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). However, the basis of this inhibition appears to be purely electrostatic and therefore different from the inhibition observed with surfen. We found that anionic polymers that were highly sulfated (and therefore had a high effective concentration of negative charges) were most potent at blocking SEVI activity, presumably by forming strong electrostatic interactions. Unlike surfen, anionic polymers also appear to have direct inhibitory activity against HIV-1 virions (14Callahan L.N. Phelan M. Mallinson M. Norcross M.A. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1543-1550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rider C.C. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 639-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Witvrouw M. De Clercq E. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 497-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Because of this direct antiviral activity, anionic polymers have already been tested as HIV microbicides in clinical trials. Unfortunately, the outcomes of those trials were for the most part unfavorable. A large scale trial of the anionic polymer Carraguard suggested that this compound provided no protection against HIV acquisition when used as a vaginal microbicide (17Skoler-Karpoff S. Ramjee G. Ahmed K. Altini L. Plagianos M.G. Friedland B. Govender S. De Kock A. Cassim N. Palanee T. Dozier G. Maguire R. Lahteenmaki P. Lancet. 2008; 372: 1977-1987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Worse yet, the results of a phase III clinical trial with another anionic polymer, cellulose sulfate, showed that women who received the compound had a higher rate of HIV acquisition relative to the placebo arm (18Van Damme L. Govinden R. Mirembe F.M. Guédou F. Solomon S. Becker M.L. Pradeep B.S. Krishnan A.K. Alary M. Pande B. Ramjee G. Deese J. Crucitti T. Taylor D. N. Engl. J. Med. 2008; 359: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). On a more positive note, a clinical trial with yet another anionic polymer, Pro-2000, suggested a 30% reduction in HIV infection, but unfortunately, the results were not statistically significant (19Cohen J. Science. 2009; 323: 996-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). One possible reason why anionic polymers have not fared well in preventing HIV acquisition is that these polymers might have induced the expression of inflammatory chemokines that recruited HIV-susceptible target cells to the genital mucosa. Inflammation also promotes T cell activation and dendritic cell maturation, processes that increase permissivity for HIV infection. The high availability of target cells as a result of inflammation may have offset any beneficial effects of the anionic polymers in preventing HIV infection. Interestingly, surfen has been reported to be anti-inflammatory through its ability to inhibit the binding of the anaphylatoxin C5a to its receptor (6Lanza T.J. Durette P.L. Rollins T. Siciliano S. Cianciarulo D.N. Kobayashi S.V. Caldwell C.G. Springer M.S. Hagmann W.K. J. Med. Chem. 1992; 35: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, surfen may prove useful not only as an inhibitor of SEVI activity but also as a means to limit the inflammatory response that can recruit HIV-susceptible target cells to the genital mucosa. In addition to enhancing HIV-1 infection, SEVI and semen can increase the infectivity of other viruses. It was recently demonstrated that the infectivity of XMRV, a virus that replicates in the human prostate, is enhanced by SEVI (20Hong S. Klein E.A. Das Gupta J. Hanke K. Weight C.J. Nguyen C. Gaughan C. Kim K.A. Bannert N. Kirchhoff F. Munch J. Silverman R.H. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 6995-7003Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Because the precursor of SEVI is produced in abundance by the prostate, XMRV infection can potentially be suppressed by SEVI inhibitors, such as surfen. Microbicides incorporating inhibitors against SEVI and other naturally occurring viral enhancement factors may therefore prove useful in limiting the spread of a variety of viral pathogens.

To test whether changes of chromatin condensation levels per se affect access and binding of proteins, we used a hypertonic cell treatment. This shift to hyperosmolar medium increased nuclear calcium concentrations and induced a reversible chromatin condensation comparable to the levels in mitosis. However, this condensation was independent of mitotic histone H3 serine 10 phosphorylation. Photobleaching and photoactivation experiments with chromatin proteins-histone H2B-GFP and GFP-HP1alpha-before and after induced chromatin condensation demonstrated that hypercondensation reduced their dissociation rate and stabilized their chromatin binding. Finally, measuring the distribution of nucleoplasmic proteins in the size range from 30 to 230 kDa, we found that even relatively small proteins like GFP were excluded from highly condensed chromatin in living cells. These results suggest that structural changes in condensed chromatin by themselves affect chromatin access and binding of chromatin proteins independent of regulatory histone modifications.-Martin, R.

https://openalex.org/W1974978001,"The islet of Langerhans is a unique micro-organ within the exocrine pancreas, which is composed of insulin-secreting beta-cells, glucagon-secreting alpha-cells, somatostatin-secreting delta-cells, pancreatic polypeptide-secreting PP cells and ghrelin-secreting epsilon-cells. Islets also contain non-endocrine cell types such as endothelial cells. However, the mechanism(s) of islet formation is poorly understood due to technical difficulties in capturing this dynamic event in situ. We have developed a method to monitor beta-cell proliferation and islet formation in the intact pancreas using transgenic mice in which the beta-cells are specifically tagged with a fluorescent protein. Endocrine cells proliferate contiguously, forming branched cord-like structures in both embryos and neonates. Our study has revealed long stretches of interconnected islets located along large blood vessels in the neonatal pancreas. Alpha-cells span the elongated islet-like structures, which we hypothesize represent sites of fission and facilitate the eventual formation of discrete islets. We propose that islet formation occurs by a process of fission following contiguous endocrine cell proliferation, rather than by local aggregation or fusion of isolated beta-cells and islets. Mathematical modeling of the fission process in the neonatal islet formation is also presented."

Furthermore, the emergence of novel H1N1 raises the potential that additional reassortments can occur, resulting in drug resistant virus. Thus, additional antiviral approaches are urgently needed. DAS181 (Fludase®), a sialidase fusion protein, has been shown to have inhibitory activity against a large number of seasonal influenza strains and a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) strain (H5N1). Here, we examine the in vitro activity of DAS181 against a panel of 2009 oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 clinical isolates. The activity of DAS181 against nine 2009, two 2007, and two 2004 clinical isolates of seasonal IFV H1N1 was examined using plaque number reduction assay on MDCK cells. DAS181 strongly inhibited all tested isolates. EC50 values remained constant against isolates from 2004, 2007, and 2009, suggesting that there was no change in DAS181 sensitivity over time. As expected, all 2007 and 2009 isolates were resistant to oseltamivir, consistent with the identification of the H274Y mutation in the NA gene of all these isolates. Interestingly, several of the 2007 and 2009 isolates also exhibited reduced sensitivity to zanamivir, and accompanying HA mutations near the sialic acid binding site were observed. DAS181 inhibits IFV that is resistant to NAIs. Thus, DAS181 may offer an alternative therapeutic option for seasonal or pandemic IFVs that become resistant to currently available antiviral drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2004835343,"CARM1 is one of nine protein arginine methyltransferases that methylate arginine residues in proteins. CARM1 is recruited by many different transcription factors as a positive regulator. Gene targeting of CARM1 in mice has been performed, and knock-out mice, which are smaller than their wild-type littermates, die just after birth. It has been proposed that CARM1 has functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity. Indeed, CARM1 is found to interact with a number of proteins and may have a scaffolding function in this context. However, CARM1 methylates histone H3, PABP1, AIB1, and a number of splicing factors, which strongly suggests that its impact on transcription and splicing is primarily through its ability to modify these substrates. To unequivocally establish the importance of CARM1 enzymatic activity <i>in vivo</i>, we generated an enzyme-dead knock-in of this protein arginine methyltransferase. We determined that knock-in cells and mice have defects similar to those seen in their knock-out counterparts with respect to the time of embryo lethality, T cell development, adipocyte differentiation, and transcriptional coactivator activity. CARM1 requires its enzymatic activity for all of its known cellular functions. Thus, small molecule inhibitors of CARM1 will incapacitate all of the enzyme's cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W2023270609,"Background The zebrafish is an increasingly popular model for studying many aspects of biology. Recently, ztert, the zebrafish homolog of the mammalian telomerase gene has been cloned and sequenced. In contrast to humans, it has been shown that the zebrafish maintains telomerase activity for much of its adult life and has remarkable regenerative capacity. To date, there has been no longitudinal study to assess whether this retention of telomerase activity equates to the retention of chromosome telomere length through adulthood. Methodology/Principal Findings We have systematically analyzed individual organs of zebrafish with regard to both telomere length and telomerase activity at various time points in its adult life. Heart, gills, kidney, spleen, liver, and intestine were evaluated at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, and 2 years of age by Southern blot analysis. We found that telomeres do not appreciably shorten throughout the lifespan of the zebrafish in any organ. In addition, there was little difference in telomere lengths between organs. Even when cells were under the highest pressure to divide after fin-clipping experiments, telomere length was unaffected. All aged (2 year old) tissues examined also expressed active amounts of telomerase activity as assessed by TRAP assay. Conclusions/Significance In contrast to several other species including humans, the retention of lifelong telomerase and telomeres, as we have reported here, would be necessary in the zebrafish to maintain its tremendous regenerative capacity. The ongoing study of the zebrafish's ability to maintain telomerase activity may be helpful in unraveling the complexity involved in the maintenance (or lack thereof) of telomeres in other species such the mouse or human."

As researchers demand molecular resolution of cellular events in the context of whole organisms, correlation of non-invasive live-organism imaging with electron microscopy in complex three-dimensional samples becomes critical. The developing blood vessels of vertebrates form a highly complex network which cannot be imaged at high resolution using traditional methods. Here we show that the point of fusion between growing blood vessels of transgenic zebrafish, identified in live confocal microscopy, can subsequently be traced through the structure of the organism using Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM) and Serial Block Face/Scanning Electron Microscopy (SBF/SEM). The resulting data give unprecedented microanatomical detail of the zebrafish and, for the first time, allow visualization of the ultrastructure of a time-limited biological event within the context of a whole organism."
https://openalex.org/W2076663174,"The molecular mechanisms that enable cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and its mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to inhibit transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling during mammary tumorigenesis remain unknown. We show here that TGF-β selectively stimulated the expression of the PGE2 receptor EP2, which increased normal and malignant mammary epithelial cell (MEC) invasion, anchorage-independent growth, and resistance to TGF-β-induced cytostasis. Mechanistically, elevated EP2 expression in normal MECs inhibited the coupling of TGF-β to Smad2/3 activation and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI1) expression, while EP2 deficiency in these same MECs augmented Smad2/3 activation and PAI expression stimulated by TGF-β. Along these lines, engineering malignant MECs to lack EP2 expression prevented their growth in soft agar, restored their cytostatic response to TGF-β, decreased their invasiveness in response to TGF-β, and potentiated their activation of Smad2/3 and expression of PAI stimulated by TGF-β. More important, we show that COX-2 or EP2 deficiency both significantly decreased the growth, angiogenesis, and pulmonary metastasis of mammary tumors produced in mice. Collectively, this investigation establishes EP2 as a potent mediator of the anti-TGF-β activities elicited by COX-2/PGE2 in normal and malignant MECs. Our findings also suggest that pharmacological targeting of EP2 receptors may provide new inroads to antagonize the oncogenic activities of TGF-β during mammary tumorigenesis.—Tian, M., Schiemann, W.

Mitochondria have their own genome that encodes a few (13 in mammals and 8 in yeast) of the 100 proteins necessary for oxidative phosphorylation (5Grivell L.A. Nature. 1989; 341: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The remaining proteins necessary for the biogenesis of oxidative phosphorylation complexes are encoded by the nuclear genome. Mitochondrial biogenesis thus depends on the coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial events. Moreover, mitochondria to nucleus signaling has been a longstanding question. In mammalian cells, it has been shown that the mitochondrial reactive oxygen species are involved in the activation of the serine/threonine protein kinase D, which in turn activates NF-κB, leading to induction of SOD2 (mitochondrial superoxide dismutase) and consequently efficient detoxification from mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (6Storz P.

Furthermore, during aging, it has been shown that while mitochondrial ROS production increases, there is a concomitant decrease in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complex amount and activity (9Shigenaga M.K.

Altogether, these results point to a possible role of ROS as signaling molecules in the cross-talk between mitochondria and nucleus. reactive oxygen species. In living cells, growth is the result of coupling between substrate catabolism and multiple metabolic processes taking place during net biomass formation and cell maintenance. A crucial parameter for growth description is its yield (i.e. the efficiency of the transformation from substrate consumption to biomass formation). When yeast cells are grown on a purely respiratory substrate, biomass generation is entirely connected to substrate oxidation through oxidative phosphorylation and, hence, to oxygen consumption. In a previous paper (1Devin A. Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Chevtzoff C. Avéret N. Bunoust O. Rigoulet M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 26779-26784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), we have shown that, in non-fermentable media, the growth yield is identical regardless of the strain, growth phase, and respiratory substrate used. This homeostasis is the consequence of a strict linear relationship between growth and respiratory rates. Moreover, the oxygen consumption rate was strictly controlled by the cellular content in respiratory chains in such a way that, in vivo, the steady state of oxidative phosphorylation was kept constant. The cAMP signaling pathway is now well known to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis, both in mammalian cells and in yeast, although the molecular mechanisms of this process are not well defined. It has been shown that treatment of human preadipocytes with forskolin (which leads to an overactivation of the cAMP pathway) increased mitochondrial DNA copy number (10Bogacka I. Ukropcova B.

In yeast, there is now a growing amount of evidence showing that overactivation of the Ras/cAMP pathway leads to an increase in the cell mitochondrial content (11Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Bunoust O.

Although they are redundant for viability and functions such as glycogen storage regulation, the three A kinases are not redundant for other functions (15Robertson L.S. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

We have shown that in the absence of the yeast protein kinase Tpk3p, there is a significant decrease in cellular mitochondrial content, when cells are grown in non-fermentable medium (19Chevtzoff C. Vallortigara J. Avéret N. Rigoulet M. Devin A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This generates a drastic decrease in cell growth in the Δtpk3 cells versus the wild type cells, because when yeast cells are grown on respiratory substrate, energy transformation processes involve oxidative phosphorylation (1Devin A.

Briefly, our previous study has allowed us to show that in Δtpk3 cells, (i) respiratory rates are decreased in these cells when compared with the wild type cells, (ii) cellular mitochondrial content that was assessed quantitatively by measuring the amount of mitochondrial cytochromes (namely aa3, b, and cc1) is decreased, and (iii) growth rate is decreased. Here, we investigated the mechanisms involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis via the yeast protein kinase Tpk3p. We show that the decrease in mitochondrial content in the Δtpk3 cells originates in a decrease in mitochondrial biogenesis. Indeed, the activity of the transcription factors (HAP2/3/4/5 complex) involved in this process is decreased in the Δtpk3 cells. Moreover, we show that the activity of this complex is modulated by mitochondrial ROS production, which is increased in the mitochondria isolated from the Δtpk3 cells. This is the first report showing that the activity of the HAP2/3/4/5 complex is sensitive to ROS signaling, thus clearly involving ROS in mitochondria to nucleus signaling.

Cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in the following medium: 0.175% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.2% casein hydrolysate (Merck), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.2% dl-lactate (w/v) (Prolabo), pH 5.5, 20 mg/liter l-tryptophan (Sigma), 40 mg/liter adenine hydrochloride (Sigma), and 20 mg/liter uracil (Sigma). When cells carried a plasmid, the relevant amino acid was taken out of the medium. Growth was measured at 600 nm in a Safas spectrophotometer (Monaco). Dry weight determinations were performed on samples of cells harvested throughout the growth period and washed twice in distilled water. The oxygen consumption was measured polarographically at 28 °C using a Clark oxygen electrode in a 1-ml thermostatically controlled chamber. Respiratory rates (JO2) were determined from the slope of a plot of O2 concentration versus time. Respiration assays of growing cells were performed in the growth medium except in the case of uncoupled respiration, which was performed after cells were harvested in the following buffer: 2 mm magnesium sulfate, 1.7 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm potassium sulfate, 10 mm glucose, and 100 mm ethanol, pH 6.8 (20Beauvoit B. Rigoulet M. Bunoust O. Raffard G. Canioni P. Guérin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cellular and mitochondrial content of c + c1, b, and a + a3 hemes were calculated as described by Dejean et al. (2Dejean L. Beauvoit B. Guérin B. Rigoulet M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1457: 45-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), taking into account the respective molar extinction coefficient values and the reduced minus oxidized spectra recorded using a dual beam spectrophotometer (Aminco DW2000). Cells were grown aerobically at 28 °C in the following medium: 0.175% yeast nitrogen base (Difco), 0.2% casein hydrolysate (Merck), 0.5% (NH4)2SO4, 0.1% KH2PO4, 0.2% lactate (w/v) (Prolabo) as carbon source, pH 5.5, 20 mg/liter l-tryptophan (Sigma), 40 mg/liter adenine hydrochloride (Sigma), and 20 mg/liter uracil (Sigma). Yeast cells were harvested in the exponential growth phase, and mitochondria were isolated from protoplasts as described (21Guérin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured by the biuret method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Yeast mitochondria were suspended in the following medium: 0.65 m mannitol, 0.36 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris-maleate, 5 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 6.8. Cells were washed and then broken by vigorous shaking with an equal volume of glass beads in the following buffer: 0.65 m mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-maleate (pH 6.8), and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-freeTM, Roche Applied Science). Centrifugation (700 × g, 2 min) allowed the elimination of pelleted unbroken cells and glass beads. Cellular proteins were quantified by the biuret method. To assess catalase activity, proteins were suspended in 90 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) and dispatched in the cuvettes of a double beam Safas spectrophotometer; 0.03% hydrogen peroxide was added in the sample cuvette, and the absorbance difference between the cuvettes was measured at 240 nm. Catalase activity was determined from the slope of a plot of H2O2 concentration versus time. The rate of H2O2 production was determined by monitoring the oxidation of the fluorogenic indicator amplex red in the presence of horseradish peroxidase. The concentrations of horseradish peroxidase and amplex red in the incubation medium were 0.06 unit/ml and 1 μm, respectively. Fluorescence was recorded at the following wavelengths: excitation, 560 nm; emission, 584 nm. A standard curve was obtained by adding known amounts of H2O2 to the assay medium in the presence of the reactants. Mitochondria (0.3 mg of protein/ml) were incubated in the respiratory medium at 28 °C, and H2O2 production was initiated by substrate (glycerol 3-phosphate, 5 mm) addition. Phosphorylating conditions were obtained by the addition of 1 mm ADP. Antimycin A (0.6 μg/mg of protein) was added into the incubation medium in order to inhibit the activity of complex III. The H2O2 production rate was determined from the slope of a plot of the fluorogenic indicator versus time (22Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). A standard permeabilization procedure was used as described (23Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar). After the preincubation period, 0.4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside was added, and the tube was briefly vortexed. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.5 m Na2CO3. The samples were centrifuged for 30 s at 14,000 × g, and the absorbance of the supernatant was read at 420 nm. Activity is given in arbitrary units. Frozen mitochondria were used to measure oxidized and reduced coenzyme Q6 contents. After dissolving and extraction in 2-propanol, CoQ6 was detected by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection as described (24Galinier A. Carrière A. Fernandez Y. Bessac A.M. Caspar-Bauguil S. Periquet B. Comtat M. Thouvenot J.P. Casteilla L. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 53-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The amount of proteins indicated in Fig. 4 was derivatized, using the Chemicon OxyBlot kit, to 2,4-dinitrophenolhydrazone by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (25Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2267) Google Scholar). The 2,4-dinitrophenol-derivatized crude protein extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE onto polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) membrane filters. The membranes were incubated with a primary antibody, specific to the 2,4-dinitrophenol moiety of the proteins, and subsequently incubated with a secondary (IgG goat anti-rabbit) horseradish peroxidase-antibody conjugate directed against the primary antibody. Filters were then treated with chemiluminescence blotting substrate (horseradish peroxidase) for detection. The filters were exposed to a blue-sensitive film that was subsequently developed. Yep352-SOD1 was kindly provided by P. Fabrizio (26Fabrizio P. Liou L.L. Moy V.N. Diaspro A. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Longo V.D. Genetics. 2003; 163: 35-46Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yep351-URA-SOD2 was constructed by switching the original auxotrophic marker with an URA3-HpAI/KasI fragment. Both genes are driven by their natural promoters. The plasmid carrying the HAP4 gene expressed under control of the TET promoter was constructed by inserting a BamHI/PstI fragment amplified from the HAP4 locus with the oligonucleotides CCCGGATCCATCATGACCGCAAAGACT and CGCCTGCAGCTATTTCAAAATACTTGTACC, in pCM189 (27Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar) linearized with BamHI/PstI. Glycogen was quantitated according to Ref. 28Parrou J.L. François J. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 248: 186-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar on 4–10 mg of cell dry weight. Cells were suspended in 50 μl of a mixture of 3.5% β-mercaptoethanol in 2 m NaOH. After a 15-min incubation on ice, proteins were precipitated with 50 μl of 3 m trichloroacetic acid for 15 min on ice. After a rapid centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of 10% SDS and sample buffer (0.1 m Tris, 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 25% glycerol, 0.002% bromphenol blue). After quantification with a Bio-Rad kit, proteins were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE performed according to the method of Laemmli. After electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), blots were probed with the desired antibodies. The proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Biosciences), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-green fluorescent protein antibody was purchased from Roche Applied Science, and anti-Ade4 antibody was a gift from Dr. B. Daignan-Fornier. Fig. 1 shows that (i) growth rate is decreased in Δtpk3 cells when compared with the wild type cells (A), (ii) cellular mitochondrial content that was assessed quantitatively by measuring the amount of mitochondrial cytochromes (namely aa3, b, and cc1) is decreased (B), and (iii) respiratory rates are decreased in these cells (C). In the Δtpk3 cells, we have shown (Fig. 1B) that cytochrome b (and thus the bc1 complex, assuming a constant b/c1 stoichiometry in this complex) is decreased by 20%, and cytochrome c is drastically decreased (50%), whereas cytochrome aa3 is slightly decreased (Fig. 1B). We hypothesized that the decreased amount of cytochrome c in the Δtpk3 cells would represent a bottleneck for electron transfer. If this were the case, one would expect the quinones (which are upstream of the cytochrome c) to be in a more reduced state. We thus determined the quinone redox states on isolated mitochondria under different conditions: non-phosphorylating (substrate oxidation), phosphorylating (oxidation coupled to phosphorylation), or fully inhibited (respiratory chain inhibition). Fig. 2 clearly shows that in the mitochondria isolated from the wild type cells, under non-phosphorylating (substrate oxidation) conditions, the quinones were about 50% reduced, and as expected, this redox state decreased under phosphorylating conditions. In the presence of antimycin A, a bc1 complex inhibitor, 80% of the quinone pool was reduced due to the well known site of inhibition of this inhibitor. Indeed, antimycin A acts in the Q-cycle directly downstream of the ubisemiquinone, thus not allowing the whole pool of quinones to be reduced. In the presence of potassium cyanide, a well known cytochrome oxidase inhibitor, as expected, over 90% of the quinone pool was reduced. In the mitochondria isolated from the Δtpk3 cells, the quinone redox state under non-phosphorylating conditions was comparable with the one determined in the presence of potassium cyanide, indicating that in this condition, the quinones were fully reduced. This redox state was only slightly decreased under phosphorylating conditions. Moreover, these quinones are involved in one-electron transfer processes that are well known to participate in reactive oxygen species production (29Chance B. Sies H. Boveris A. Physiol. Rev. 1979; 59: 527-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (4830) Google Scholar, 30Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 31Casteilla L. Rigoulet M. Pénicaud L. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Since yeast mitochondria do not harbor any complex I, ubisemiquinone is the most likely candidate as a superoxide generator at the level of complex III. Because the quinone redox state was very much increased in the Δtpk3 isolated mitochondria, we investigated ROS production in these mitochondria. Table 1 shows that the rate of H2O2 production in these mitochondria was 4–5 times higher than the rate in the wild type mitochondria, establishing that the mutant mitochondria produce high levels of ROS. It is noteworthy that whereas in the wild type mitochondria, coupling oxidation to phosphorylation decreased the ROS production rate by 40%, in the mutant mitochondria, there was no significant decrease when substrate oxidation was coupled to ATP synthesis.TABLE 1H2O2 production in isolated mitochondriaRate of H2O2 productionWild typeΔtpk3pmol/min/mg proteinNon-phosphorylating59 ± 5238 ± 38Phosphorylating42 ± 4230 ± 47Antimycin A283 ± 65417 ± 34 Open table in a new tab One of the questions raised by this study is how Tpk3p deficiency led to an increase in mitochondrial ROS production. The activity of some of the respiratory chain complexes has been shown to be regulated by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of one of their subunits (32Bender E. Kadenbach B. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This process leads to a regulation of the flux through the respiratory chain and might have an impact on the rate of ROS production. In order to decipher whether mitochondrial ROS generation was regulated by Tpk3p, their production rate was assessed in the presence of cAMP. Fig. 3 clearly shows that cAMP induces a decrease in ROS production rate on isolated wild type mitochondria, whereas there is no significant decrease of this rate on isolated Δtpk3 mitochondria. Because the Δtpk3 isolated mitochondria produced more ROS, we investigated the status of the ROS protection enzymes that allow the cells to avoid the deleterious effects of these species. Superoxide (O2̇̄) produced by the mitochondrial respiratory chain can be dismutated to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase. There are two superoxide dismutases, SOD1 (copper-zinc superoxide dismutase), which is cytosolic and present in the mitochondrial intermembrane space, and SOD2 (manganese superoxide dismutase), which is located within the mitochondrial matrix. Further, mitochondrial and cytosolic catalases convert the hydrogen peroxide generated by the activity of these enzymes in water and oxygen. The activity of these enzymes was investigated on whole cells. There was only a slight increase in mitochondrial SOD activity, whereas the cytosolic SOD was significantly increased in the Δtpk3 cells (see Fig. 6B), and catalase activity was doubled in the mutant cells (35 × 106 units/mg proteins for the wild type and 72 × 106 units/mg proteins for the Δtpk3 cells), indicating an oxidative stress in these cells. However, data relative to ROS production at the mitochondrial level (see above) indicate that this increase is not sufficient to prevent the increase in ROS production in the Δtpk3 mitochondria. The oxidative stress was further confirmed by the level of carbonylation of the mitochondrial proteins from both strains (Fig. 4). Indeed, due to its irreversible nature, the level of protein carbonylation is considered a good indicator of oxidative stress. Fig. 4 further strengthens the finding that the Δtpk3 cells are subjected to an oxidative stress. Oxidative stress has long been considered an “accident” of aerobic metabolism, a stochastic process of free radical production and nonspecific tissue damage that is fundamentally unregulated aside from the antioxidant defense mechanisms. In recent years, a paradigm shift has been occurring, wherein certain ROS have become appreciated as signaling molecules whose production may be regulated as a part of routine cellular signal transduction (33Suzuki Y.J. Forman H.J. Sevanian A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 269-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). Because ROS production was largely increased in the mutant mitochondria, we hypothesized that these species might be involved in the signaling leading to a decrease in the mitochondrial enzymatic content. We thus monitored the growth of both wild type and Δtpk3 cells in the presence of a potent antioxidant: N-acetylcysteine. Fig. 5A clearly shows that growth was fully restored in the mutant cells in the presence of an antioxidant. Cellular mitochondrial content was assessed quantitatively by measuring the amount of mitochondrial cytochromes, namely aa3, b, and cc1. Fig. 5B shows that there was a full restoration in the mitochondrial cytochrome content of the Δtpk3 cells when grown in the presence of N-acetylcysteine. Furthermore, metabolic activity of these cells grown on respiratory substrate was assessed through respiratory rate measurement. Fig. 5C unequivocally shows that any respiratory rate in the mutant cells in the presence of N-acetylcysteine was comparable with the wild type cells with N-acetylcysteine. This clearly indicates that the decrease in mitochondrial enzymatic content of the Δtpk3 cells is due to an increase in ROS production. Moreover, the bc1 complex can produce reactive oxygen species both on the matrix side of the membrane and on the intermembranal side (34Sun J. Trumpower B.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 419: 198-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Because the diffusible and thus signaling species of ROS is thought to be hydrogen peroxide, either matricial and/or inner membrane ROS could be involved in the signaling process. To sort out whether the localization of the ROS produced was of importance in the signaling process, we overexpressed either the matricial SOD (SOD2) or the cytosolic SOD (SOD1) in the Δtpk3 strain. Fig. 6A clearly shows that overexpression of the cytosolic SOD (which is mostly located in the mitochondrial inner membrane space) led to an almost complete abrogation of the respiratory defect in Δtpk3 cells. Matricial SOD overexpression had little effect on the Δtpk3 cell respiratory rate. Fig. 6B shows that both SOD1 and -2 are indeed overexpressed under our experimental conditions. Because SOD1 is overexpressed 2.5 times in Δtpk3-SOD1 cells versus Δtpk3 cells and SOD2 is overexpressed about 3 times in Δtpk3-SOD2 cells versus SOD2 cells, their overexpression level is comparable (see Fig. 6B). Fig. 6C shows that cellular cytochrome content is almost completely restored in the Δtpk3-SOD1 cells. In order to ensure that the ROS-induced decrease of mitochondrial content and its sensitivity to an antioxidant in the Δtpk3 cells was indeed specific to the mitochondrial compartment, we assessed cellular glycogen content. It is well known that glycogen storage is impaired in mutants of the yeast Ras/cAMP pathway (35Smith A. Ward M.P. Garrett S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3556-3564Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), a decrease in the activity of this pathway being associated with an increase in cellular glycogen content. Table 2 shows that there is an important increase in cellular glycogen content in the Δtpk3 cells versus the wild type cells and that this increase is not affected by an antioxidant, such as N-acetylcysteine. This strengthens the fact that the ROS signaling here is indeed specific to the mitochondrial compartment.TABLE 2Cellular glycogen content in wild type and Δtpk3 cellsGlycogenNon-treatedN-Acetylcysteineμg/mg proteinWild type3.5 ± 1.33.2 ± 1.1Δtpk326 ± 3.424 ± 3.8 Open table in a new tab Microorganisms adapt their metabolism to environmental conditions and, particularly, to nutrient availability. The yeast has a clear preference for glucose as a carbon source, with subsequent conversion to ethanol by fermentation. During this shift from fermentation to respiration, gene expression is largely reprogrammed (36DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O. Science. 1997; 278: 680-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (3699) Google Scholar). This is achieved by derepression of glucose-repressed genes and specific induction of genes involved in gluconeogenesis, metabolism of alternate carbon sources, respiration, and mitochondrial development (37Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The Hap2/3/4/5p transcription factor has been shown to be involved in these transcriptional changes. Indeed, disruption of any subunits of this complex renders the cells unable to grow"
https://openalex.org/W2006709045,"The aim of this study was to search for lipid signatures in blood plasma from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients using a novel MALDI-TOF-ClinProTools™ strategy, initially developed for protein analysis, and thin layer chromatography coupled to MALDI-TOF (TLC-MALDI). Samples from 33 CF patients and 18 healthy children were subjected to organic extraction and column chromatography separation of lipid classes. Extracts were analyzed by MALDI-TOF, ion signatures were compared by the ClinProTools™ software and by parallel statistical analyses. Relevant peaks were identified by LC-MSn. The ensemble of analyses provided 11 and 4 peaks differentially displayed in CF vs healthy and in mild vs severe patients respectively. Ten ions were significantly decreased in all patients, corresponding to 4 lysophosphatidylcholine (18∶0, 18∶2, 20∶3, and 20∶5) and 6 phosphatidylcholine (36∶5, O-38∶0, 38∶4, 38∶5, 38∶6, and P-40∶1) species. One sphingolipid, SM(d18∶0), was significantly increased in all patients. Four PC forms (36∶3, 36∶5, 38∶5, and 38∶6) were consistently downregulated in severe vs mild patients. These observations were confirmed by TLC-MALDI. These results suggest that plasma phospholipid signatures may be able to discriminate mild and severe forms of CF, and show for the first time MALDI-TOF-ClinProTools™ as a suitable methodology for the search of lipid markers in CF."
https://openalex.org/W2093519904,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3K4) is methylated by the Set1 complex (Set1C or COMPASS). Besides the catalytic Set1 subunit, several proteins that form the Set1C (Swd1, Swd2, Swd3, Spp1, Bre2, and Sdc1) are also needed to mediate proper H3K4 methylation. Until this study, it has been unclear how individual Set1C members interact and how this interaction may impact histone methylation and gene expression. In this study, Bre2 and Sdc1 are shown to directly interact, and it is shown that the association of this heteromeric complex is needed for proper H3K4 methylation and gene expression to occur. Interestingly, mutational and biochemical analysis identified the C terminus of Bre2 as a critical protein-protein interaction domain that binds to the Dpy-30 domain of Sdc1. Using the human homologs of Bre2 and Sdc1, ASH2L and DPY-30, respectively, we demonstrate that the C terminus of ASH2L also interacts with the Dpy-30 domain of DPY-30, suggesting that this protein-protein interaction is maintained from yeast to humans. Because of the functionally conserved nature of the C terminus of Bre2 and ASH2L, this region was named the SDI (Sdc1 Dpy-30 interaction) domain. Finally, we show that the SDI-Dpy-30 domain interaction is physiologically important for the function of Set1 in vivo, because specific disruption of this interaction prevents Bre2 and Sdc1 association with Set1, resulting in H3K4 methylation defects and decreases in gene expression. Overall, these and other mechanistic studies on how H3K4 methyltransferase complexes function will likely provide insights into how human MLL and SET1-like complexes or overexpression of ASH2L leads to oncogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2029896871,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway regulates many biological processes, including insulin-regulated GLUT4 insertion into the plasma membrane. However, Akt operates well below its capacity to facilitate maximal GLUT4 translocation. Thus, reconciling modest changes in Akt expression or activity as a cause of metabolic dysfunction is complex. To resolve this, we examined insulin regulation of components within the signaling cascade in a quantitative kinetic and dose-response study combined with hierarchical cluster analysis. This revealed a strong relationship between phosphorylation of Akt substrates and GLUT4 translocation but not whole cell Akt phosphorylation. In contrast, Akt activity at the plasma membrane strongly correlated with GLUT4 translocation and Akt substrate phosphorylation. Additionally, two of the phosphorylated sites in the Akt substrate AS160 clustered separately, with Thr(P)-642 grouped with other Akt substrates. Further experiments suggested that atypical protein kinase Czeta phosphorylates AS160 at Ser-588 and that these two sites are mutually exclusive. These data indicate the utility of hierarchical cluster analysis for identifying functionally related biological nodes and highlight the importance of subcellular partitioning of key signaling components for biological specificity."
https://openalex.org/W2146062002,"18Beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), the major bioactive component of licorice root extract, has a protective effect on hepatic injury and exhibits antiinflammatory activity. Here, we investigate the effect of GA in Propionibacterium acnes-induced acute inflammatory liver injury. C57BL/6 mice were primed with P. acnes followed by lipopolysaccharide challenge to induce fulminant hepatitis. GA (75 mg/kg) or vehicle control was administered intraperitoneally daily 1 day after P. acnes priming, and GA significantly improved mouse mortality. Then, to investigate the underlying mechanisms of GA in this acute inflammatory liver injury model, we primed C57BL/6 mice with P. acnes only. We propose that GA ameliorates acute P. acnes-induced liver injury through reduced macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha expression in Kupffer cells by down-regulating MyD88 expression and inhibiting NF-kappaB activation. Reduced MIP-1alpha expression lowered the recruitment of CD11c(+)B220(-) dendritic cell precursors into the liver. Consequently, GA treatment inhibits the activation and proliferation of liver-infiltrating CD4(+) T cells and reduces the production of serum alanine aminotransferase and proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Moreover, anti-MIP-1alpha treatment in P. acnes-primed mice inhibits the recruitment of dendritic cell precursors into the liver and suppresses mouse mortality as GA does. Taken together, our results suggest that GA exhibits antiinflammatory effects through inhibition of MIP-1alpha in a mouse model of acute P. acnes-induced inflammatory liver injury."

Experiments in this report indicate that BCL10 is required for activation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB by both canonical and noncanonical pathways, following stimulation by the sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan (CGN). In wild type and IκB-kinase (IKK)α−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, increases in phospho-IκBα, nuclear NF-κB p65 (RelA) and p50, and KC, the mouse analog of human interleukin-8, were markedly reduced by silencing BCL10 or by exposure to the free radical scavenger Tempol. In IKKβ−/− cells, BCL10 silencing, but not Tempol, reduced the CGN-induced increases in KC, phospho-NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), cytoplasmic NF-κB p100, and nuclear NF-κB p52 and RelB, suggesting a BCL10 requirement for activation of the noncanonical pathway. In NCM460 cells, derived from normal, human colonic epithelium, the CGN-induced increases in NF-κB family members, p65, p50, p52, and RelB, were inhibited by BCL10 silencing. Although enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confocal images demonstrated no change in total NIK following CGN, increases in phospho-NIK in the wild type, IKKβ−/− and IKKα−/− cells were inhibited by silencing BCL10. These findings indicate an upstream signaling role for BCL10, in addition to its effects on IKKγ, the regulatory component of the IKK signalosome, and a requirement for BCL10 in both canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation.

In this report, we demonstrate that BCL10 was required for NF-κB activation by both canonical and noncanonical pathways, following stimulation by the sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan (CGN) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in human colonic epithelial cells. Previously, we reported that CGN significantly up-regulated transcription of BCL10 in NCM460 cells (6Borthakur A. Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

B-cell lymphoma/CLL 10 carrageenan wild type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reactive oxygen species fast-activated cell-based small interfering RNA NF-κB-inducing kinase IκB kinase Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. mouse embryonic fibroblast. The sulfated polysaccharide carrageenan has been widely used for decades to induce inflammation in animal and tissue culture models. In our previous work, CGN was shown to induce an inflammatory cascade in human colonic epithelial cells by two distinct mechanisms: an immune-mediated mechanism involving TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4), IRAK (IL-1β receptor activating kinase), BCL10, phospho-IκBα (inhibitor of κB), NF-κB (nuclear factor κB), and IL-8 (interleukin-8); and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated mechanism involving phospho-Hsp27, IκB kinase (IKK)-β, phospho-IκBα, BCL10, NF-κB, and IL-8 (6Borthakur A.

Carrageenan activation of these pathways was attributable to its distinctive chemical structure, including its resemblance to the naturally occurring glycosaminoglycans, its highly sulfated galactose residues, and its unusual α-Gal(1→3)Gal bond that is a known immune epitope (10Bhattacharyya S. Liu H. Zhang Z. Jam M. Dudeja P.K. Michel G. Linhardt R.J. Tobacman J.K. J. Nutr. Biochem. 2009; (Epub ahead of print)PubMed Google Scholar, 11Galili U. Immunol. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Because CGN is a commonly used food additive in the Western diet, these pathways may induce inflammation and disease in the human colon and implicate a role for BCL10 in human disease, in addition to the MALT lymphomas. To further define the BCL10-mediated activation of NF-κB and the interactions between the ROS and TLR4-BCL10 pathways, the requirements for different components of the IKK signaling complex and the responses of different members of the NF-κB family were investigated. The IKK signaling complex, including the catalytic components IKKα and IKKβ and the regulatory component IKKγ, also known as NEMO (NF-κB essential modifying factor), integrates upstream signals and leads to the phosphorylation of IκBα. Subsequently, phospho-IκBα is ubiquitinated, and the localization signal for NF-κB nuclear translocation is exposed. These events represent critical signals in the progression of the inflammatory cascade from a series of membrane events to a cellular reaction with transcriptional responses. To clarify the role of BCL10 with different components of the IKK signalosome and the subsequent effects on members of the NF-κB family, experiments with mouse embryonic fibroblasts that lack either IKKα or IKKβ were performed, and the inter-relationships among BCL10, phospho-NIK, and NF-κB family members, including p65, p100, p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel, were determined. NCM460 is a nontransfected human colonic epithelial cell line that was derived from the normal colonic mucosa of a 68-year-old Hispanic male (12Moyer M.P. Manzano L.A. Merriman R.L. Stauffer J.S. Tanzer L.R. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1996; 32: 315-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). NCM460 cells were grown in M3:10TM media (INCELL, San Antonio, TX) and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO2 environment with media changes at 2-day intervals. Confluent cells were harvested by trypsinization, and subcultured in multiwell tissue culture clusters (Costar). Cells were treated with λ-carrageenan (CGN) 1 μg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich), for 1–24 h, and spent media were collected from control and treated wells and stored at −80 °C. Cells were harvested by scraping. Total cell protein was measured by BCATM protein assay kit (Pierce), using bovine serum albumin as standard. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including wild type (WT), IKKα−/−, and IKKβ−/− were a generous gift from the laboratory of Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego). These cell lines were obtained from transgenic mice in which IKKα and IKKβ genes were deleted and homozygous mice were bred (13Li Z.W. Chu W. Hu Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R.

The superoxide scavenger Tempol (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyolpiperidinyloxy; Axxora, San Diego, CA) was used to inhibit the effects of free oxygen radicals generated by CGN. Tempol was used at a concentration of 100 nm and coadministered with CGN (1 μg/ml) for 24 h as described previously (8Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 973-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The secretion of IL-8 in the spent medium of control and treated NCM460 cells was measured using the DuoSet ELISA kit for human IL-8 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), as described previously (9Bhattacharyya S. Gill R. Chen M.L. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10550-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). KC, the mouse homolog of IL-8, was measured by ELISA (R&D Systems) in spent medium, and the results were compared with standards. The sample values were normalized with the total cell protein concentrations determined by BCATM Protein assay kit (Pierce), and KC values were expressed as pg/mg protein. Expression of BCL10 protein in control and CGN-treated NCM460 cells was determined by a solid-phase ELISA, previously developed by our laboratory for quantitative determination of BCL10 (15Bhattacharyya S. Pant N. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2007; 28: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Control or treated cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4), and the cell extracts were stored at −80 °C until assayed, using ELISA as reported previously (16Bhattacharyya S. Borthakur A. Pant N. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 293: G429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phospho-IκBα was determined using an ELISA assay in NCM460 cells and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, including WT, IKKα−/−, and IKKβ−/− cells, as described previously (6Borthakur A. Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G829-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). IκBα phosphorylated at Ser32 was detected by the PathScan® Sandwich ELISA kit (Cell Signaling), which is a solid-phase sandwich ELISA with a mouse monoclonal antibody against IκBα coated onto the microwells of a 96-well plate. Total and phospho-NIK in control and treated human cell samples were measured by a fast-activated cell-based (FACE) ELISA (Active Motif) (17Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2009; 15: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using a primary goat antibody for NIK (sc-7211; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) against the epitope 700-947 and phospho-NIK (sc-12957; SCBT) that recognized Thr559. Measurements of optical density were compared between control and treated samples. Specific antibody for phospho-BCL10 (Ser 138; SCBT) and BCL10 antibody (QED Biosciences Inc., San Diego, CA; epitope AA 5–19) were used to detect the content of phospho-BCL10 (Ser138) and total BCL10 present in the NCM460 cells following exposure to λCGN (1 μg/ml for 24 h) and to compare with untreated control cells. Nuclear extracts were prepared from treated and control NCM460 cells as described previously, using a nuclear extraction kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Activated NF-κB family members in the samples were determined by oligonucleotide-based ELISA (Active Motif). The specificity of the binding of NF-κB of the samples with the coated nucleotide sequence was determined by comparison to the control binding, determined by adding either free consensus nucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) or mutated nucleotide (5′-AGTTGAGGCCACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) to the reaction buffer, as described previously (17Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2009; 15: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The sample values were normalized with the total cell protein determined by protein assay kit (Pierce). Cells treated with vehicle or carrageenan (1 μg/ml) for 24 h were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) (Cell Signaling). The cell lysates were precleared with protein A/G plus-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with anti-ubiquitin antibody (SCBT) at 4 °C for 16 h, followed by incubation with protein A/G plus-agarose for 5 h. Parallel control experiments were performed by incubating the precleared cell lysate with normal rabbit IgG followed by incubation with protein A/G plus-agarose. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed four times with lysis buffer and heated to 95 °C for 5 min after adding Laemmli buffer. For the immunoblots, the resulting immunoprecipitates or the proteins in the nuclear extracts or in the whole cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with the indicated human or mouse antibodies (anti-IKKγ, anti-ubiquitin, anti-NF-κB p100, or anti-BCL10; SCBT) and the immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). NCM460 cells were grown in compartment slides for 24 h until 50% confluent. Then, cells were treated with either control small interfering RNA (siRNA), BCL10 siRNA, or control IgG2α antibody. After 24 h, test cells were exposed to λCGN (1 μg/ml) for 24 h. Methods for staining and examination of cells by confocal microscopy were described previously (9Bhattacharyya S. Gill R. Chen M.L. Zhang F. Linhardt R.J. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 10550-10558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once in 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm calcium chloride, pH 7.4, fixed for 1.5 h with 2% paraformaldehyde, and then permeabilized with 0.08% saponin. Preparations were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, blocked in 5% normal goat serum, incubated overnight with NIK or phospho-NIK antibody at 4 °C, and then washed and stained with either Alexa Fluor® 568 donkey anti-goat or goat-anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) (1:100, Invitrogen). Cells were exposed for 1 h to Alexa Fluor® 488 phalloidin (Invitrogen) diluted 1:40 to stain actin and coverslipped using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole-mounting medium (Vectashield®, Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) for nuclear staining. Preparations were washed thoroughly, mounted, and observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope equipped with excitation at 488 and 534 nm from an Ar/Kr laser and at 361 nm from a UV laser. Green and red fluorescence were detected through LP505 and 585 filters. The fluorochromes were scanned sequentially, and the collected images were exported with Zeiss LSM Image Browser software as TIFF files for analysis and reproduction. Silencing BCL10 was performed as described previously (6Borthakur A. Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G829-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Bhattacharyya S. Borthakur A. Pant N. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 293: G429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Effectiveness of BCL10 silencing in the NCM460 cells and the MEF was determined by BCL10 ELISA, following exposure to BCL10 siRNA for 24 h. In the NCM460 cells, silencing reduced baseline BCL10 protein by ∼82% (from 1.30 (±0.07) to 0.24 (±0.02) ng/mg protein). Bcl10 was reduced by ∼81% in the WT MEF cells, but precise quantification was not possible due to a lack of mouse recombinant Bcl10. Unless stated otherwise, statistical significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance, followed by post hoc Tukey-Kramer test for multiple comparisons using Instat software. Measurements are the mean of at least three independent biological experiments with technical replicates ± S.D. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. One asterisk indicates statistical significance at the 0.01 < p ≤ 0.05 level, two asterisks 0.001 < p ≤ 0.01, and three asterisks, p ≤ 0.001. Error bars designate S.D. Silencing BCL10 reduced the increases in KC that followed exposure to λCGN (1 μg/ml × 24 h) in the MEF cells, including WT (Fig. 1A), IKKα−/− (B), and IKKβ−/− (C). The ROS inhibitor Tempol also reduced the increase in KC in the IKKα−/− (IKKβ-containing) cells, but not in the IKKβ−/− (IKKα-containing) cells. The combination of BCL10 silencing and Tempol completely inhibited the increase in KC in the WT and IKKα−/− cells. KC increased by ∼1.78 ng/mg protein in the WT cells, ∼1.09 ng/mg protein in the IKKα−/− cells, and least (∼0.50 ng/mg protein) in the IKKβ−/− cells, following CGN exposure. At baseline in the WT MEF, BCL10 cellular concentration was 2.05 (±0.17) ng/mg protein, increasing to 4.85 (±0.11) ng/mg protein following exposure to λCGN 1 μg/ml for 24 h (data not shown). In IKKα−/− cells following CGN exposure, BCL10 increased from 1.59 (±0.09) ng/mg protein to 3.78 (±0.33) ng/mg protein. In the IKKβ−/− cells, BCL10 increased from 1.74 (±0.18) ng/mg protein to 4.22 (±0.59) ng/mg protein following CGN. These results demonstrate ∼2–3-fold increases in BCL10 protein expression following CGN exposure, and the response occurred in both IKKα and IKKβ cells, as well as the WT cells. NF-κB components include p65 (RelA), RelB, and c-Rel, which have a transactivating domain, and p50 and p52, which are products of proteasomal degradation of p105 and p100, respectively. In the IKKβ−/− and WT MEF cells, BCL10 silencing markedly reduced the CGN-induced increases in p100, as detected by Western blot and by densitometry (Fig. 2A). Consistent with this, the CGN-induced increases of nuclear p52 shown by ELISA in the WT and IKKβ−/− cells declined when BCL10 was silenced, but with no change in the IKKα−/− cells (Fig. 2, B–D). In the WT MEF cells, CGN exposure produced significant increases in p65, p50, p52, and RelB (Fig. 2B). In the IKKα−/− cells, p52 and RelB did not increase (Fig. 2C), and in the IKKβ−/− cells, p65 and p50 did not increase (D). BCL10 silencing completely reduced the increases in p52 and RelB and significantly reduced the declines in p65 and p50. In NCM460 cells, CGN exposure produced increases in p65, p50, p52, RelB, but not c-Rel. Again, BCL10 silencing completely abrogated the increases in p52 and RelB and significantly reduced the increases in p65 and p50 (Fig. 2E). BCL10 silencing had no effect on c-Rel. When WT (Fig. 3A) or IKKα−/− (B) cells, were exposed to CGN, phospho-IκBα production increased to 2.6 times the baseline. These increases were reduced by Tempol or by BCL10 silencing, and completely inhibited by their combination. In the IKKβ−/− cells (Fig. 3C), phospho-IκBα did not increase following CGN exposure. These results are consistent with CGN induction through IKKα of a phospho-IκBα independent pathway of NF-κB activation. In the MEF and NCM460 cells, no significant changes in total NIK followed CGN treatment (Fig. 4, A–D). However, following CGN, phospho-NIK, increased in the WT (Fig. 4A) to 2.5× the baseline, in IKKα−/− to 3.1× the baseline (B), in the IKKB−/− (C) cells to 2.3× the baseline and in the NCM460 cells to 2.2× the baseline (D), as measured by the FACE assay. BCL10 silencing blocked these increases, demonstrating a requirement for BCL10 to phosphorylate NIK following CGN exposure. CGN exposure produced a 4-fold increase (n = 6, p < 0.001) in phospho(Ser138)-BCL10, compared with baseline in the NCM460 cells, when measured by FACE assay. Because BCL10 was required for NIK phosphorylation, the findings suggest that activation of BCL10 by phosphorylation preceded NIK phosphorylation and was independent of IKKα and IKKβ in these experiments. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor-α-induced NIK phosphorylation was found to be independent of BCL10 (data not shown). Images by confocal microscopy of total NIK (Fig. 5, A–F) and phospho-NIK (G–M) in NCM460 cells support the finding that CGN-induced NIK phosphorylation is dependent on BCL10. Total NIK images demonstrate diffuse cytoplasmic, as well as membrane localization of NIK in the untreated control (Fig. 5, A–B). Staining intensity did not increase following CGN either in the presence of control siRNA (Fig. 5, C–D) or BCL10 siRNA (E–F). An increase in membrane-associated NIK staining is seen following CGN with control siRNA, but not with BCL10 siRNA treatment. When fluorescent immunostaining with phospho-NIK was performed and confocal images were acquired, no phospho-NIK was seen in the untreated control (Fig. 5, G–H) or following BCL10 siRNA (K–L), in contrast to the appearance following CGN exposure in the presence of control siRNA (I–J). The presence of cell membrane-associated phospho-NIK is demonstrated in the z-stack images (Fig. 5M), in which phospho-NIK immunostaining appeared only along the outer membrane of NCM460 cells and did not penetrate to the interior of the cells. Following NCM460 cell treatment with CGN, immunoprecipitation with ubiquitin and Western blot with IKKγ were performed. Increase in ubiquitinated IKKγ was apparent, with increased density of the higher molecular mass band and reduction in density of the baseline IKKγ band (Fig. 6A). Also, IKKγ co-immunoprecipitated with BCL10 in the NCM460 cells, and the BCL10 that co-immunoprecipitated with the IKKγ increased in response to CGN (Fig. 6B). These findings demonstrate that in addition to the observed effects of BCL10 and CGN on the catalytic components IKKα and IKKβ of the IKK signalosome, there is also an impact on the ubiquitination of IKKγ, the regulatory component of the IKK signalosome. BCL10 emerges as an important mediator of both the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation stimulated by CGN in NCM460 cells and MEF (Fig. 7). BCL10 was increased by CGN in both IKKα−/− and IKKβ−/− MEF, and BCL10 silencing by siRNA reduced CGN-induced stimulation of p65, p50, p100, p52, and RelB in MEF and NCM460 cells. These effects implicate BCL10 in the inflammatory cascade beyond its interaction with IKKγ and emphasize that BCL10 has a key role as a mediator of the innate immune response in epithelial, as well as its more established role in immune cells (18Zhou H.

Karin M. Ghosh G. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 12482-12490Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, the studies presented in this report revealed that CGN stimulated both the noncanonical, as well as the canonical pathway of NF-κB activation and that BCL10 was required for these effects upstream of the IKK signalosome. CGN joins the small group of known mediators of both the noncanonical and canonical pathways that includes lymphotoxin and B-cell activating factor (20Yilmaz Z.B. Weih D.S. Sivakumar V. Weih F. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 21Endo T. Nishio M. Enzler T. Cottam H.B. Fukuda T. James D.F. Karin M. Kipps T.J. Blood. 2007; 109: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). By induction of both the canonical and noncanonical pathways of NF-κB activation, BCL10 and CGN are positioned to influence a wide range of NF-κB transcriptional effects. The p52/RelB heterodimer appears to bind to a broader spectrum of κB sites than the p50/RelA heterodimer and may even bind to a modified consensus sequence (22Fusco A.J. Huang D.B. Miller D. Wang V.Y. Vu D. Ghosh G. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 152-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Wharry C.E. Haines K.M. Carroll R.G. May M.J. Cancer Biol.

By activation of the noncanonical pathway, CGN and BCL10 may evoke responses similar to those of tumor necrosis factor-α, as well as those elicited by inflammatory mediators such as dextran sulfate sodium that act through ROS (17Bhattacharyya S. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Inflamm Bowel Dis. 2009; 15: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The complexity of the negative feedback on NF-κB, involving mediators such as IκBδ, as well as IκB-α, -β, and -ϵ, may include stimulus specific responses and different, but specified kinetic rate constants (25Shih V.F.

Immunol. 2001; 167: 5895-5903Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Also, the protein content of RelB was reported to be significantly reduced when p105 and p100 were absent, suggesting that the noncanonical pathway may be affected by intricate protein-protein relationships that exist among NF-κB components, as well as by transcriptional events. The interaction of these regulatory mechanisms with BCL10 poses an additional series of mechanistic interactions that require further investigation. The study findings demonstrated an increase in phospho-NIK following stimulation by CGN and showed localization of phospho-NIK to the outer cell membrane. BCL10 silencing inhibited the CGN-induced effects on phospho-NIK. These data challenge some previous observations about NIK activation, because previously, the LPS-activated TLR-mediated pathway was not associated with NIK (29Fusco A.J. Savinova O.V. Talwar R. Kearns J.D. Hoffmann A. Ghosh G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12324-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and we have found that the TLR4-BCL10 mediated pathway resembles the CGN-activated pathway (16Bhattacharyya S. Borthakur A. Pant N. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 293: G429-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The data demonstrated that BCL10 silencing inhibited the increase in phospho-NIK, consistent with a vital role for BCL10 in the IKKα-mediated pathway, although the role of phospho-NIK in the IKKβ-mediated pathway remains obscure. The translocation of phospho-NIK to the outer cell membrane was unexpected but resembles changes shown upon activation of other molecules, including the catalytic subunit of (Na+ + K+)-ATPase and sphingosine kinase (SphK1) (30Myers A.C.

SphK1 translocation to the plasma membrane from the cytosol involved activation of G(q)-coupled receptors, stimulation by platelet-derived growth factor, nerve growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, tumor necrosis factor-α, IgE, lysophosphatidic acid, or methacholine, and phosphorylation of Ser225. The phenomenon of “signaling inside out” has been associated with the SphK1 translocation, leading to the secretion of sphingosine-1-phosphate with subsequent cross-activation of sphingosine-1-phosphate G-protein-coupled receptors. No evidence exists at this time for involvement of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling or altered signaling dynamic of pNIK, although the SphK1 paradigm is provocative in consideration of how a localized stimulus can propagate. Altered cellular localization of pNIK following activation of NIK was observed previously in renal tubular cells from tissue preparations in models of ischemia-reperfusion (32Loverre A. Ditonno P. Crovace A. Gesualdo L. Ranieri E. Pontrelli P. Stallone G. Infante B. Schena A. Di Paolo S. Capobianco C. Ursi M. Palazzo S. Battatglia M. Selvaggi F.P. Schena F.P. Grandaliano G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 2675-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The distinct localization along the outer surface of the cells is attributable to the large size of the carrageenan molecule, limiting its direct effect to cells on the surface, as noted previously with the CGN-TLR4 interaction (9Bhattacharyya S.

Vital questions remain regarding BCL10 interactions with other known mediators of inflammatory mechanisms in both immune and nonimmune cells. The CBM complex, comprised of Carma1 (CARD 11) or Carma3 (CARD 10), BCL10, and MALT1, has been identified as critical to propagation of the inflammatory stimulation, yet the precise mechanism of the CARD-CARD interaction between CARMA and BCL10 and the relationship to MALT1 and other mediators require further elucidation of the precise protein-protein interactions involved. In addition, other important mediators of the inflammatory cascade(s), including TRAFs 2, 3, 4, and 6, TAB1 and 2, as well as RIP, are intimately involved in the cellular inflammatory response, yet their activating or regulating functions with regard to BCL10 require further investigation. Interestingly, BCL10 silencing does not inhibit the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α (15Bhattacharyya S. Pant N. Dudeja P.K. Tobacman J.K. J. Immunoassay Immunochem. 2007; 28: 173-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), implying that there may be multiple upstream mechanisms by which NIK is activated prior to interaction with IKKα. This combination of specificity and redundancy is consistent with a somewhat limited repertoire of cellular inflammatory responses to a more unlimited variety of extracellular stimuli that are integrated at the level of the IKK signalosome. Recent findings in our lab indicate that the BCL10 promoter contains a sequence that has a very high score (>90%) for likelihood as an NF-κB binding site (33Borthakur A. Bhattacharyya S. Alrefai W. Tobacman J. Ramaswamy K. Dudeja P.K. Inflam. Bowel Dis. 2009; 8 (Epub ahead of print): 27Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that CGN may induce the constitutive activation of a BCL10/NF-κB loop, in which increases in BCL10 lead to increases in NF-κB and increases in NF-κB lead to increases in BCL10. This may lead to an ongoing cycle of inflammation, perhaps autonomous once initiated. Previously, in the MALT lymphomas, constitutive activation of NF-κB arose following chromosomal translocations that affected BCL10 (1Zhang Q. Siebert R. Yan M. Hinzmann B. Cui X. Xue L.

In the setting of exogenous stimulation by CGN, it is possible that constitutive activation of NF-κB and BCL10 follows stimulation due to specific characteristics of the CGN related to its chemical structure, rather than to effects of a specific activating translocation.

We examined whether rats exposed to hypoxia had altered keratin IF expression in their alveolar epithelial type II (ATII) cells. There was a significant decrease in keratin protein levels in hypoxic ATII cells compared with those in ATII cells isolated from normoxic rats. To define the mechanisms regulating this process we studied changes to the keratin IF network in A549 cells (an alveolar epithelial cell line) exposed to 1.5% oxygen. We observed a time-dependent disassembly-degradation of keratin 8 and 18 proteins, which was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Hypoxia-treated A549 cells deficient in mitochondrial DNA or A549 cells treated with a small interfering RNA against the Rieske iron-sulfur protein of mitochondrial complex III did not have increased levels of ROS nor was the keratin IF network disassembled and degraded. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)/catalase mimetic (EUK-134) prevented the hypoxia-mediated keratin IF degradation as did the overexpression of SOD1 but not of SOD2. Accordingly, we provide evidence that hypoxia promotes the disassembly and degradation of the keratin IF network via mitochondrial complex III-generated reactive oxygen species.-Na, N., Chandel, N.

https://openalex.org/W2033131290,"Mutation of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is a key early event in the development of most colorectal tumors. APC promotes degradation of beta-catenin and thereby negatively regulates Wnt signaling, whereas mutated APCs present in colorectal tumor cells are defective in this activity. APC also stimulates the activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Asef and regulates cell morphology and migration. Truncated mutant APCs constitutively activate Asef and induce aberrant migration of colorectal tumor cells. Furthermore, we have recently found that Asef and APC function downstream of hepatocyte growth factor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. We show here that Asef is required for basic fibroblast growth factor- and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced endothelial cell migration. We further demonstrate that Asef is required for basic fibroblast growth factor- and vascular endothelial growth factor-induced microvessel formation. Furthermore, we show that the growth as well as vascularity of subcutaneously implanted tumors are markedly impaired in Asef(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice. Thus, Asef plays a critical role in tumor angiogenesis and may be a promising target for cancer chemotherapy."

Recent experiments using two photon laser microscopy indicate that dendritic cells (DCs) are central to Treg cell function and that the in vivo mechanisms of T cell regulation are more complex than those described in vitro.Here we have sought to determine whether and how modulation of Treg numbers modifies the lymph node (LN) microenvironment. We found that pro-inflammatory chemokines -- CCL2 (MCP-1) and CCL3 (MIP-la) -- are secreted in the LN early (24 h) after T cell activation, that this secretion is dependent on antigen-specific DC-T cell interactions, and that it was inversely related to the frequency of Tregs specific for the same antigen. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Tregs modify the chemoattractant properties of antigen-presenting DCs, which, as the frequency of Tregs increases, fail to produce CCL2 and CCL3 and to attract antigen-specific T cells.These results substantiate a major role of Tregs in LN patterning during antigen-specific immune responses."

A recent study of this system by Leal and Ishida (2008) made two major claims, the validity and significance of which we examine here. After reviewing existing literature, analyzing the methods and results of Leal and Ishida (2008), and generating new data from one of their study sites, we conclude that their claim that polygyny can occur in Solenopsis invicta in the U.S.A. in the absence of expression of the b-like allele Gp-9b is unfounded. Moreover, we argue that available information on insect OBPs (the family of proteins to which GP-9 belongs), on the evolutionary/population genetics of Gp-9, and on pheromonal/behavioral control of fire ant colony queen number fails to support their view that GP-9 plays no role in the chemosensory-mediated communication that underpins regulation of social organization.

https://openalex.org/W2060453331,"Long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons has stages that correspond to the stages of learning and memory. Early-phase (10–30 min) potentiation is accompanied by rapid increases in clusters or puncta of presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, which depend on actin polymerization but not on protein synthesis. We have now examined changes in pre- and postsynaptic puncta and structures during glutamate-induced late-phase (3 hr) potentiation in cultured hippocampal neurons. We find that (1) the potentiation is accompanied by long-lasting maintenance of the increases in puncta, which depends on protein synthesis, (2) most of the puncta and synaptic structures are very dynamic, continually assembling and disassembling at sites that are more stable than the puncta or structures themselves, (3) the increase in presynaptic puncta appears to be due to both rapid and more gradual increases in the number of sites where the puncta may form, and also to the stabilization of existing puncta, (4) under control conditions, puncta of postsynaptic proteins behave similarly to puncta of presynaptic proteins and share sites with them, and (5) the increase in presynaptic puncta is accompanied by a similar increase in presumably presynaptic structures, which may form at distinct as well as shared sites.

This ensured a non-linear mode of signal transmission with the output being shaped by the balance between the strength of input signal and the activity gradient along the phosphatase axis. Shifts in this balance yielded modulations in topology of the motif, thereby expanding the repertoire of output responses.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), like all malignancies, is considered to result from the sequential acquisition of multiple genetic lesions in a normal, likely long-lived cell. This paradigm presents a conundrum, however, since emerging evidence increasingly indicates that the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) responsible for sustaining AML exhibit features of downstream myeloid progenitors, cells which under normal circumstances are irreversibly committed to becoming terminally differentiated within days to weeks (Somervaille and Cleary, 2006Somervaille T.C. Cleary M.L. Cancer Cell. 2006; 10: 257-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, Krivtsov et al., 2006Krivtsov A.V. Twomey D. Feng Z. Stubbs M.C. Wang Y. Faber J.

A critical component of the model is the presumed requirement for self-renewal, a type of cell division occurring in stem cells which results in at least one daughter cell with essentially the same extensive proliferative potential and differentiation status as its parent. One possibility is that key leukemia-initiating mutations occur in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the only normal blood cells that undergo self-renewal, resulting in a population of preleukemic HSCs with a proliferative and/or survival advantage over their nonmutated counterparts. The accumulation of further mutations in these initiated cells over time results in full-fledged leukemia, associated with aberrant self-renewal in downstream myeloid progenitors. An alternative possibility is that leukemia-initiating mutations may directly confer the capacity of inappropriate self-renewal on downstream cells. A new study (Bereshchenko et al., 2009Bereshchenko O. Mancini E. Moore S. Bilbao D. Månsson R. Luc S. Grover A. Jacobsen S.W. Bryder D. Nerlov C. Cancer Cell. 2009; 16: 390-400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) provides insight into this issue by demonstrating in a knockin mouse model that CEBPA mutations can prime HSCs to generate downstream myeloid leukemia stem cells. CEBPA (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha) is a leucine zipper transcription factor (expressed as two isoforms of either 30 kD or 42 kD) that regulates myeloid differentiation in hematopoiesis, as well as the differentiation of other tissue-specific cell types in liver, fat, and lung. It functions in part through repression of E2F and MYC activity, and its complete absence in hematopoietic cells induces pleiotropic effects, including a block in myeloid differentiation accompanied by profound reductions in mature myeloid cell populations, an accumulation of myeloblasts in the bone marrow without progression to AML, and an enhanced self-renewal capacity of HSCs (Koschmieder et al., 2009Koschmieder S. Halmos B. Levantini E. Tenen D.G. J. Clin. Oncol. 2009; 27: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). CEBPA mutations are present in 7%–10% of human AML and are mostly associated with a normal karyotype. The mutation patterns observed are generally biallelic (∼70% of cases) and almost always combine an N-terminal frameshift mutation on one allele with a C-terminal in-frame insertion/deletion mutation on the other allele (Pabst and Mueller, 2007Pabst T. Mueller B.U. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). N-terminal mutations prohibit expression of the 42 kD protein isoform, whereas C-terminal mutations disrupt DNA binding and dimerization by both isoforms (Figure 1). The molecular mechanisms through which CEBPA mutations promote AML are not entirely clear, although the 30 kD isoform binds and transactivates target genes with lower efficiency than the 42 kD isoform, suggesting that hypomorphic mutant alleles have an impaired capacity to couple cell-cycle arrest to terminal myeloid lineage differentiation. Bereshchenko et al. generated two knockin mutations of the mouse CEBPA locus that correspond to each of the two common alterations observed in human AML samples. The “K allele” (a K313KK mutation) generated a C-terminal mutant, while the “L allele” (a nonsense codon in the p42-specific region of CEBPA) mimicked the human N-terminal mutation (Figure 1A). To study the cell-intrinsic potential of these CEBPA mutations to initiate AML, the authors transplanted fetal liver cells from K/L knockin mice that expressed one of each of the two mutant alleles or cells from L/L mice or K/K mice into irradiated, wild-type recipients. Recipients in all three cohorts succumbed to AML with a median latency of 40–50 weeks. Four weeks following transplantation and prior to overt leukemia development, mice that received K/K or K/L cells (but not those that received L/L cells) exhibited a modest relative expansion of the immunophenotypic HSC compartment, and a much more substantial expansion of multipotent progenitors (MPPs) downstream of HSCs. Both preleukemic HSCs and MPPs were less quiescent. Thus, the presence of the K mutation promotes proliferation and expansion of HSCs and MPPs in the early stages of leukemogenesis, although it is unclear if the mutant MPPs at this preleukemic stage have already acquired unlimited self-renewal potential. The myeloid differentiation block observed in the K/K AMLs, a mutation combination not found in human AML, appeared more profound than in the K/L and L/L AMLs, resulting in some cases in erythroleukemia rather than AML, a phenotype reminiscent of that observed in CEBPA null blood cells. Thus, there may be a critical hypomorphic range of CEBPA activity that is leukemogenic in humans, with either too little or too much being insufficient to induce disease, explaining the prevalent mutation combination observed in CEBPA mutated AML patients. Despite preleukemic expansion and elevated cycling activity of the HSC and MPP populations, the LSCs responsible for sustaining AML did not exhibit features of HSCs or MPPs. Rather, LSCs had a downstream myeloid precursor immunophenotype (CD117+, Sca1−, Mac1+) similar to that reported previously in mice with leukemias initiated by MLL fusion oncogenes (Somervaille et al., 2009Somervaille T.C. Matheny C.J. Spencer G.J. Iwasaki M. Rinn J.L. Witten D.M. Chang H.Y. Shurtleff S.A. Downing J.R. Cleary M.L. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 129-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Thus, the preleukemic HSCs appear to spawn downstream myeloid cells that are predisposed to complete LSC conversion by acquisition of secondary genetic or epigenetic changes that remain undefined. In addition to their proliferative expansion, mutant HSCs also displayed alterations in their differentiation programming. Gene-expression profiling of K/L mutant HSCs revealed that granulocyte-macrophage gene sets were significantly downregulated, whereas erythroid lineage gene sets were significantly upregulated, suggesting both the presence of skewed lineage priming and that CEBPA actively regulates expression of multiple myeloid lineage-specific genes even in uncommitted HSCs. This finding also suggests that in CEBPA mutant HSCs, the prevailing transcriptional state predicts the subsequent block in myeloid differentiation in a downstream cell. Thus, mutant HSCs appear primed for leukemogenesis, ready for the acquisition of further changes that contribute to the generation of inappropriately self-renewing downstream LSCs. Although it is not currently clear what potential selective advantage a single CEBPA mutation might confer on an HSC, this study provides support for the model in which certain leukemia initiating mutations have the capacity to convert HSCs to proliferative, developmentally skewed, preleukemic HSCs, whose downstream progeny subsequently acquire the requisite secondary genetic or epigenetic changes necessary to become full-fledged AML LSCs (Figure 1B). This model is somewhat reminiscent of acute blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia, where BCR-ABL-positive HSCs in the chronic phase of the disease eventually generate granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (GMPs) with enhanced in vitro proliferative potential in the acute phase (Jamieson et al., 2004Jamieson C.H. Ailles L.E. Dylla S.J. Muijtjens M. Jones C. Zehnder J.L. Gotlib J. Li K. Manz M.G. Keating A. et al.N. Engl. J. Med. 2004; 351: 657-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar), and also AML1-ETO-associated AML, where the fusion oncogene may be found expressed in the HSC compartment for years following apparent cure of the disease (Miyamoto et al., 2000Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. Akashi K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 7521-7526Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). However, this priming model does not appear to be generalized for AML pathogenesis or necessary, since it is not a feature of several other mouse models of AML. For example, powerful oncogenes such as MLL-AF9 or MOZ-TIF2 (Huntly et al., 2004Huntly B.J. Shigematsu H. Deguchi K. Lee B.H. Mizuno S. Duclos N. Rowan R. Amaral S. Curley D. Williams I.R. et al.Cancer Cell. 2004; 6: 587-596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) have the capacity to confer self-renewal directly on downstream myeloid progenitors such as GMPs as an alternative pathway for AML initiation. It remains to be determined how accurately the different mouse models reflect human AML. A future challenge will be to identify and isolate preleukemic and leukemic clones from patients with AML, aiming to compare the mutational status of these functionally distinct populations."
