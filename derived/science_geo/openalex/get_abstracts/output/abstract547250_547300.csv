https://openalex.org/W2181882767,"Introduction Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major risk factor in the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, the mechanisms linking AKI to CKD remain unclear. We examined the alteration of macrophage phenotypes during an extended recovery period following ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) and determine their roles in the development of fibrosis. Methods The left renal pedicle of mice was clamped for 40 min. To deplete monocyte/macrophage, liposome clodronate was injected or CD11b-DTR and CD11c-DTR transgenic mice were used. Results Throughout the phase of IRI recovery, M2-phenotype macrophages made up the predominant macrophage subset. On day 28, renal fibrosis was clearly shown with increased type IV collagen and TGF-β. The depletion of macrophages induced by the liposome clodronate injection improved renal fibrosis with a reduction of kidney IL-6, type IV collagen, and TGF-β levels. Additionally, the adoptive transfer of the M2c macrophages partially reversed the beneficial effect of macrophage depletion, whereas the adoptive transfer of the M1 macrophages did not. M2 macrophages isolated from the kidneys during the recovery phase expressed 2.5 fold higher levels of TGF-β than the M1 macrophages. The injection of the diphtheria toxin into CD11b or CD11c-DTR transgenic mice resulted in lesser depletion or no change in M2 macrophages and had little impact on renal fibrosis. Conclusion Although M2 macrophages are known to be indispensible for short-term recovery, they are thought to be main culprit in the development of renal fibrosis following IRI."

Secreted frizzled-related protein 5 (Sfrp5) has been shown to function as an extracellular inhibitor of non-canonical Wnt signaling that is expressed at relatively high levels in white adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Sfrp5 in the heart under ischemic stress. Sfrp5 KO and WT mice were subjected to ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Although Sfrp5-KO mice exhibited no detectable phenotype when compared with WT control at baseline, they displayed larger infarct sizes, enhanced cardiac myocyte apoptosis, and diminished cardiac function following I/R. The ischemic lesions of Sfrp5-KO mice had greater infiltration of Wnt5a-positive macrophages and greater inflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression when compared with WT mice. In bone marrow-derived macrophages, Wnt5a promoted JNK activation and increased inflammatory gene expression, whereas treatment with Sfrp5 blocked these effects. These results indicate that Sfrp5 functions to antagonize inflammatory responses after I/R in the heart, possibly through a mechanism involving non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK signaling.

Inflammation is widely recognized to be involved in the pathogenesis, severity, and outcome of ischemic heart disease (1Ridker P.M. Lüscher T.F. Anti-inflammatory therapies for cardiovascular disease.Eur. Heart J. 2014; 35: 1782-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Obesity is thought to contribute to cardiovascular disorders, at least in part, through the systemic release of pro-inflammatory adipokines by dysfunctional white adipose tissue (WAT) 2The abbreviations used are: WAT, white adipose tissue; I/R, ischemia/reperfusion; Sfrp, secreted frizzled-related protein; BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; NRVM, neonatal rat ventricular myocyte; AAR, area at risk; IA, infarction area; LV, left ventricular; LVEDD, LV end diastolic diameter; LVESD, LV end systolic diameter; %FS, percentage of fractional shortening; qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase 3β.

Inflammasome activation of cardiac fibroblasts is essential for myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.Circulation. 2011; 123: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), and the acute healing and eventual outcome of ischemic myocardial injury are dependent upon the appropriately choreographed regulation of numerous pro- and anti-inflammatory modulators. In this regard, immune modulators produced by adipose tissue can either facilitate or impair the myocardial healing process, depending on the status of adipose tissue function and the composition of its inflammatory secretome (3Nakamura K.

Thus, a better understanding of the links between obesity-mediated inflammatory processes and post-infarct remodeling of the heart is warranted. At the cellular level, inflammatory processes are tightly orchestrated by secreted signaling molecules that bind to specific cell surface receptors and activate intracellular signaling pathways. Signaling by Wnt ligands is a major regulator of several biological processes, but its roles in modulating inflammatory responses are relatively understudied. The 19 Wnt family proteins contain cysteine-rich domains and activate signaling by binding to one or more of the 10 frizzled family receptors (10Kikuchi A. Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Multiplicity of the interactions of Wnt proteins and their receptors.Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Wnt signaling can be classified as canonical or a non-canonical (10Kikuchi A. Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Multiplicity of the interactions of Wnt proteins and their receptors.Cell.

Biol. 2004; 20: 781-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (4221) Google Scholar). Canonical Wnt signaling involves activation of the β-catenin signaling pathway. Non-canonical Wnt signaling involves other pathways including planar cell polarity and Ca2+ pathways (10Kikuchi A. Yamamoto H. Kishida S. Multiplicity of the interactions of Wnt proteins and their receptors.Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Rao T.P. Kühl M.

Alternative Wnt pathways and receptors.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2012; 4: a007914Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Wnt3a is the prototypical ligand that induces canonical signaling, whereas Wnt5a has mostly been associated with non-canonical signaling. Canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways are generally thought to functionally oppose each other. It is reported that both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways play an important role in cardiac development and myocyte differentiation (12Rao T.P. Kühl M.

Res. 2010; 107: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Both canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling pathways can be regulated by several endogenous antagonists, including Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF), Cerberus (CER), and Dickkopf (Dkk) (18Kawano Y. Kypta R. Secreted antagonists of the Wnt signalling pathway.J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 2627-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar). Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) represent a family of decoy receptors that negatively modulate Wnt signaling (19Finch P.W. He X. Kelley M.J. Uren A. Schaudies R.P. Popescu N.C. Rudikoff S.

Accumulating evidence implicates the participation of Sfrps in ischemic cardiovascular diseases. It is reported that Sfrp2 activates mesenchymal stem cells and promotes cardiac repair following myocardial infarction via inhibition of bone morphogenic protein (BMP) and canonical Wnt signaling (24Alfaro M.P.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 21110-21115Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Sfrp1 has also been shown to have a protective role in post-infarct left ventricular (LV) remodeling (26Barandon L. Casassus F. Leroux L. Moreau C. Allières C. Lamazière J.M. Dufourcq P. Couffinhal T. Duplàa C.

Biol. 2011; 31: e80-e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the combined blockade of Wnt/frizzled signaling by Wnt3a/Wnt5a homologues suppresses development of heart failure following myocardial infarction (27Laeremans H. Hackeng T.M. van Zandvoort M.A. Thijssen V.L. Janssen B.J. Ottenheijm H.C. Smits J.F. Blankesteijn W.M.

Although these studies provide compelling evidence for the importance of Sfrp/Wnt signaling in cardiac development and disease, the role of this signaling pathway in the context of inflammatory cardio-metabolic disease has not been investigated. We and other groups have reported that Sfrp5 is highly expressed in WAT and is involved in obesity and metabolic function (28Ouchi N. Higuchi A. Ohashi K. Oshima Y. Gokce N. Shibata R. Akasaki Y.

Most of these reports are consistent with the interpretation that Sfrp5 has an anti-inflammatory effect and that it exerts these effects through the suppression of non-canonical Wnt5a/JNK signaling pathway. To date, nothing has been reported about the role of Sfrp5 in ischemic heart disease. Here, we investigate whether Sfrp5 affects the inflammatory response of the heart to acute ischemic injury. Specifically, we tested the effects of Sfrp5 on myocardial infarct size, apoptotic activity, and inflammatory responses following ischemia reperfusion (I/R) injury. We also tested the effects of Sfrp5 on mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDM) phenotype in vitro. Our observations indicate that Sfrp5 is cardio-protective in the context of I/R injury. This protection is associated with the inhibition of Wnt5a/JNK-dependent anti-inflammatory actions of Sfrp5. Antibodies against phospho-JNK (Thr-172), JNK, phospho-GSK-3β, total GSK-3β, and GAPDH were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Galectin3 (also known as Mac2) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Wnt5a antibody was obtained from R&D Systems. Recombinant Sfrp5, TNFα, Wnt5a, and Wnt3a proteins (expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, endotoxin level is <1.0 enzyme units per 1 μg of the protein by the Limulus amebocyte lysate method) were obtained from R&D Systems. SP600125, which is a JNK inhibitor, tunicamycin, and hydrogen peroxide were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. DMEM and RPMI 1640 medium were purchased from Life Technologies. Sfrp5-deficient mice are viable and fertile and do not display overt abnormalities at baseline. Mice lacking Sfrp5 were backcrossed and maintained on the C57BL/6 background (Charles River Laboratories). Sfrp5−/− (Sfrp5-KO) mice were generated by replacing the first protein coding exon with the PGKneobpAloxA cassette as described previously (34Satoh W. Matsuyama M. Takemura H. Aizawa S. Shimono A. Sfrp1, Sfrp2, and Sfrp5 regulate the Wnt/β-catenin and the planar cell polarity pathways during early trunk formation in mouse.Genesis. 2008; 46: 92-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sfrp5-KO mice and littermate WT C57BL/6 mice were used. All experiments were performed in adherence with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines on the Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Boston University. Ten-to-twelve-week-old male WT and Sfrp5-KO mice underwent I/R injury as described previously (9Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Adiponectin protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through AMPK- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Following anesthetization (pentobarbital 50 mg/kg intraperitoneal) and intubation, a suture was ligated around the proximal left coronary artery using a snare occluder. Ischemia followed by reperfusion was accomplished by tightening the snare occluder for 30 min and then loosening it. Myocardial reperfusion was confirmed by changes in ECG as well as by changes in the appearance of the heart from pale to bright red. The suture was left in place, and the chest was closed. During the surgical procedure, ECG and the rectal temperature were monitored, and the rectal temperature was maintained at 37 ± 0.5 °C. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, the chest was re-opened and the suture was re-tied. Evans Blue dye was injected at the aortic root to determine the area at risk (AAR). The heart was then excised and incubated with 1.5% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride for 10 min at 37 °C to determine the infarction area (IA). LV area, AAR, and IA were determined by computerized planimetry using ImageJ. To measure LV systolic function and chamber dimensions, echocardiography was performed with a Vevo 770 machine using a probe 707B (30 MHz). Mice were anesthetized with 1–2% isoflurane and placed on the heating pad (37 °C) during observation. The heart was first visualized in long/short axis views followed by M-mode analysis of the short axis. The symmetrical short axis images were obtained at the level of papillary muscles. Diastolic intraventricular septum, diastolic posterior wall thickness (PWd), LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and LV end systolic diameter (LVESD) were assessed from M-mode images. %LV fractional shortening (%FS) was calculated by the following equation: %FS = LVESD/(LVEDD − LVESD) × 100. At least three measurements were obtained and averaged for every data point from each mouse. Myocardial tissues from WT or Sfrp5-KO mice were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. Fixed tissues were replaced sucrose solution before embedding by OCT compound. Cryostat sections were cut at a thickness of 5 μm. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with 0.3% H2O2 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% horse serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Samples were incubated with goat polyclonal Wnt5a antibody (R&D Systems; 1:100) overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with biotin-conjugated secondary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-avidin. After incubation, a VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunofluorescence, tissues were blocked with BSA and then incubated with Wnt5a (R&D Systems) antibody and Mac2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody, followed by incubation with anti-goat IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Life Technologies) for detection of Wnt5a and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Life Technologies) for detection of Mac2. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Images were recorded using a Zeiss LSM 710-Live Duo scan confocal microscope. Tissue samples were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Thermo Scientific) with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Thermo Scientific). Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Thermo Scientific). Equal amounts of protein (10–50 μg) were separated in denaturing SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dried skim milk or BSA in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with the primary antibodies(1:100–1:1000) at 4 °C overnight, followed by incubation with the secondary antibody conjugated with HRP (1:2500–1:10000) at room temperature for 1 h. Proteins were visualized using the ECL Plus Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNA was prepared from mouse tissues and cultured cells by using an RNeasy mini or micro kit (Qiagen), respectively. cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of total RNA using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was carried out on a ViiA7 (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green real-time PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The Δ-Δ Ct method using 36B4 or GAPDH RNA and sham/control as the reference and calibrator, respectively, was employed for relative quantification of gene expression. Primary cultures of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) were prepared as described previously (9Shibata R. Sato K. Pimentel D.R. Takemura Y. Kihara S. Ohashi K. Funahashi T. Ouchi N. Walsh K. Adiponectin protects against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury through AMPK- and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 1096-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). NRVMs were incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 18 h after preparation. Assays were performed after 24–48 h of serum deprivation. A GasPak system (BD Biosciences) was used to create hypoxic conditions. BMDMs were obtained by in vitro differentiation of mouse bone marrow progenitors. Bone marrow cells were aseptically flushed from femurs and tibias of mice through a 27-gauge needle. Cells were then plated and cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 2 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 10% heat-inactivated FBS (low endotoxin level), and 10 ng/ml M-CSF (R&D Systems). Assays were performed at day 5 after plating and induction of BMDM differentiation by M-CSF treatment. Mouse 3T3-L1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and differentiated into adipocytes by treatment with DMEM supplemented with 5 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutyl-xanthine, and 1 μm dexamethasone (35Maeda N. Takahashi M. Funahashi T. Kihara S. Nishizawa H. Kishida K. Nagaretani H. Matsuda M. Komuro R. Ouchi N. Kuriyama H. Hotta K. Nakamura T. Shimomura I. Matsuzawa Y. PPARγ ligands increase expression and plasma concentrations of adiponectin, an adipose-derived protein.Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2094-2099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). At day 7 after differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with tunicamycin, H2O2, TNFα, or vehicle for 24 h. TUNEL staining for both hearts after I/R and cultured NRVMs after hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) with or without pretreatment (Wnt5a, Sfrp5, or SP600125), was performed using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science). For heart tissues, specimens were fixed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then incubated with anti-sarcomeric actinin antibody (Sigma; clone EA53, 1:100) for 60 min followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Life Technologies). Specimens were then incubated with TUNEL staining solution for 1 h according to the manufacturer's protocol. For NRVMs, equal numbers of cells were exposed to 12 h of hypoxia followed by 24 h of reoxygenation, and then treated as described above with the 4% paraformaldehyde fixation for 15 min at room temperature. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. TUNEL-positive cardiomyocytes were counted in randomly selected three fields of the slide. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Analyses were performed using StatView software. To compare three or more groups, a one- or two-way analysis of variance was performed with post hoc Student's t tests. For echocardiographic analysis, a two-way repeated measured analysis of variance was performed with Bonferroni post hoc tests. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Consistent with prior studies (28Ouchi N. Higuchi A. Ohashi K. Oshima Y. Gokce N. Shibata R. Akasaki Y. Shimono A. Walsh K.

Sfrp5 mRNA expression in the myocardium is low when compared with epididymal WAT (Fig. 1B). In contrast to Sfrp5, levels of Sfrp1, Sfrp3, and Sfrp4 were low or undetectable in epididymal WAT, whereas Sfrp2 showed modest expression (Fig. 1C). Deficiency of Sfrp5 did not detectably affect the expression of other Sfrp family members (Fig. 1C). WT and Sfrp5-KO mice were subjected to 30 min of left anterior descending artery ligation followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Myocardial I/R in WT mice led to a marked reduction in Sfrp5 transcript expression in epididymal and pericardial fat (Fig. 2).

https://openalex.org/W2195629512,"Intestinal stem cells (ISCs) drive small intestinal epithelial homeostasis and regeneration. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulates stem and progenitor cell metabolism and is frequently dysregulated in human disease, but its physiologic functions in the mammalian small intestinal epithelium remain poorly defined. We disrupted the genes mTOR, Rptor, Rictor, or both Rptor and Rictor in mouse ISCs, progenitors, and differentiated intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) using Villin-Cre. Mutant tissues and wild-type or heterozygous littermate controls were analyzed by histologic immunostaining, immunoblots, and proliferation assays. A total of 10 Gy irradiation was used to injure the intestinal epithelium and induce subsequent crypt regeneration. We report that mTOR supports absorptive enterocytes and secretory Paneth and goblet cell function while negatively regulating chromogranin A-positive enteroendocrine cell number. Through additional Rptor, Rictor, and Rptor/Rictor mutant mouse models, we identify mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 as the major IEC regulatory pathway, but mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 also contributes to ileal villus maintenance and goblet cell size. Homeostatic adult small intestinal crypt cell proliferation, survival, and canonical wingless-int (WNT) activity are not mTOR dependent, but Olfm4(+) ISC/progenitor population maintenance and crypt regeneration postinjury require mTOR. Overall, we conclude that mTOR regulates multiple IEC lineages and promotes stem and progenitor cell activity during intestinal epithelium repair postinjury."
https://openalex.org/W2189475346,"B cell malignancies comprise a diverse group of cancers that proliferate in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and peripheral blood. SIRT3 (sirtuin 3) is the major deacetylase within the mitochondrial matrix that promotes aerobic metabolism and controls reactive oxygen species (ROS) by deacetylating and activating isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). There is controversy as to whether SIRT3 acts as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor, and here we investigated its role in B cell malignancies. In mantle cell lymphoma patient samples, we found that lower SIRT3 protein expression was associated with worse overall survival. Further, SIRT3 protein expression was reduced in chronic lymphocytic leukemia primary samples and malignant B cell lines compared to primary B cells from healthy donors. This lower level of expression correlated with hyperacetylation of IDH2 and SOD2 mitochondrial proteins, lowered enzymatic activities, and higher ROS levels. Overexpression of SIRT3 decreased proliferation and diminished the Warburg-like phenotype in SIRT3-deficient cell lines, and this effect is largely dependent on deacetylation of IDH2 and SOD2. Lastly, depletion of SIRT3 from malignant B cell lines resulted in greater susceptibility to treatment with an ROS scavenger but did not result in greater sensitivity to inhibition of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α pathway, suggesting that loss of SIRT3 increases proliferation via ROS-dependent but hypoxia-inducible factor-1α-independent mechanisms. Our study suggests that SIRT3 acts as a tumor suppressor in B cell malignancies, and activating the SIRT3 pathway might represent a novel therapeutic approach for treating B cell malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2265332191,"Severe thermal injury induces a pathophysiological response that affects most of the organs within the body; liver, heart, lung, skeletal muscle among others, with inflammation and hyper-metabolism as a hallmark of the post-burn damage. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a key component in development of inflammatory and metabolic responses induced by burn. The goal of the current study was to evaluate several critical mitochondrial functions in a mouse model of severe burn injury. Mitochondrial bioenergetics, measured by Extracellular Flux Analyzer, showed a time dependent, post-burn decrease in basal respiration and ATP-turnover but enhanced maximal respiratory capacity in mitochondria isolated from the liver and lung of animals subjected to burn injury. Moreover, we detected a tissue-specific degree of DNA damage, particularly of the mitochondrial DNA, with the most profound effect detected in lungs and hearts of mice subjected to burn injury. Increased mitochondrial biogenesis in lung tissue in response to burn injury was also observed. Burn injury also induced time dependent increases in oxidative stress (measured by amount of malondialdehyde) and neutrophil infiltration (measured by myeloperoxidase activity), particularly in lung and heart. Tissue mononuclear cell infiltration was also confirmed by immunohistochemistry. The amount of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers decreased in the liver, but increased in the heart in later time points after burn. All of these biochemical changes were also associated with histological alterations in all three organs studied. Finally, we detected a significant increase in mitochondrial DNA fragments circulating in the blood immediately post-burn. There was no evidence of systemic bacteremia, or the presence of bacterial DNA fragments at any time after burn injury. The majority of the measured parameters demonstrated a sustained elevation even at 20-40 days post injury suggesting a long-lasting effect of thermal injury on organ function. The current data show that there are marked time-dependent and tissue-specific alterations in mitochondrial function induced by thermal injury, and suggest that mitochondria-specific damage is one of the earliest responses to burn injury. Mitochondria may be potential therapeutic targets in the future experimental therapy of burns."
https://openalex.org/W2186929894,"Dredging poses a potential risk to tropical ecosystems, especially in turbidity-sensitive environments such as coral reefs, filter feeding communities and seagrasses. There is little detailed observational time-series data on the spatial effects of dredging on turbidity and light and defining likely footprints is a fundamental task for impact prediction, the EIA process, and for designing monitoring projects when dredging is underway. It is also important for public perception of risks associated with dredging. Using an extensive collection of in situ water quality data (73 sites) from three recent large scale capital dredging programs in Australia, and which included extensive pre-dredging baseline data, we describe relationships with distance from dredging for a range of water quality metrics. Using a criterion to define a zone of potential impact of where the water quality value exceeds the 80th percentile of the baseline value for turbidity-based metrics or the 20th percentile for the light based metrics, effects were observed predominantly up to three km from dredging, but in one instance up to nearly 20 km. This upper (~20 km) limit was unusual and caused by a local oceanographic feature of consistent unidirectional flow during the project. Water quality loggers were located along the principal axis of this flow (from 200 m to 30 km) and provided the opportunity to develop a matrix of exposure based on running means calculated across multiple time periods (from hours to one month) and distance from the dredging, and summarized across a broad range of percentile values. This information can be used to more formally develop water quality thresholds for benthic organisms, such as corals, filter-feeders (e.g. sponges) and seagrasses in future laboratory- and field-based studies using environmentally realistic and relevant exposure scenarios, that may be used to further refine distance based analyses of impact, potentially further reducing the size of the dredging footprint."
https://openalex.org/W2187775989,"The objectives of this study were to evaluate the formation of lymphvascular niches in lymph nodes of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and investigate the roles of lymphangiogenic and angiogenic factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, and VEGF-D, expressed in the primary tumors.Forty-four patients with previously untreated clinically late T2 or T3 OSCC of cN0 were evaluated for primary tumors and 166 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Primary tumors were immunohistochemically analyzed for expressions of VEGFs. Densities of lymphatic vessels (LVDpodoplanin) and high endothelial venules (HEVD) in the SLNs were also calculated using antibodies for each marker, podoplanin and MECA-79, respectively.In 25 patients, all lymph nodes were metastasis-negative, whereas, in 19 patients, metastasis was positive for at least one lymph node (either at SLN, non-SLN, or nodal recurrence). From the analyses of 140 SLNs without metastasis, LVDpodoplanin in 50 SLNs of metastasis-positive cases was significantly higher than that in 90 SLNs of metastasis-negative cases (p = 0.0025). HEVD was not associated with lymph node metastasis. The patients with VEGF-A-High or VEGF-D-High tumors had significantly higher LVDpodoplanin than patients with their Low counterparts (p = 0.0233 and p = 0.0209, respectively). In cases with lymph node metastasis, the VEGF-D-expression score was significantly higher than in those without lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0006).These results suggest that lymph node lymphangiogenesis occurs before metastasis in OSCC. VEGF-A and VEGF-D play critical roles in this process. VEGF-D is a potential predictive marker of positive lymph node metastasis in cN0 patients."
https://openalex.org/W2181931718,"BMP10 is highly expressed in the developing heart and plays essential roles in cardiogenesis. BMP10 deletion in mice results in embryonic lethality because of impaired cardiac development. In adults, BMP10 expression is restricted to the right atrium, though ventricular hypertrophy is accompanied by increased BMP10 expression in a rat hypertension model. However, reports of BMP10 activity in the circulation are inconclusive. In particular, it is not known whether in vivo secreted BMP10 is active or whether additional factors are required to achieve its bioactivity. It has been shown that high-affinity binding of the BMP10 prodomain to the mature ligand inhibits BMP10 signaling activity in C2C12 cells, and it was proposed that prodomain-bound BMP10 (pBMP10) complex is latent. In this study, we demonstrated that the BMP10 prodomain did not inhibit BMP10 signaling activity in multiple endothelial cells, and that recombinant human pBMP10 complex, expressed in mammalian cells and purified under native conditions, was fully active. In addition, both BMP10 in human plasma and BMP10 secreted from the mouse right atrium were fully active. Finally, we confirmed that active BMP10 secreted from mouse right atrium was in the prodomain-bound form. Our data suggest that circulating BMP10 in adults is fully active and that the reported vascular quiescence function of BMP10 in vivo is due to the direct activity of pBMP10 and does not require an additional activation step. Moreover, being an active ligand, recombinant pBMP10 may have therapeutic potential as an endothelial-selective BMP ligand, in conditions characterized by loss of BMP9/10 signaling.

During cardiogenesis, BMP10 is exclusively expressed in the ventricular trabecular myocardium (1Neuhaus H. Rosen V. Thies R.S. Heart specific expression of mouse BMP-10 a novel member of the TGF-β superfamily.Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) of mouse embryos at E9.0–13.5, a critical time for cardiac growth and chamber maturation. The hearts from BMP10−/− mice, which die during embryogenesis, show hypoplastic and thin ventricles with little trabeculation (2Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z.

BMP10 is essential for maintaining cardiac growth during murine cardiogenesis.Development. 2004; 131: 2219-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Overexpression of BMP10 in the postnatal myocardium leads to smaller hearts within 6 weeks after birth, significant reduction in ventricular chamber dimensions, thickening of the ventricular wall, and narrowing in the subaortic region (3Chen H.

In adults, BMP10 expression is restricted to the right atrium (2Chen H. Shi S. Acosta L. Li W. Lu J. Bao S. Chen Z. Yang Z. Schneider M.D. Chien K.R. Conway S.J. Yoder M.C. Haneline L.S. Franco D. Shou W. BMP10 is essential for maintaining cardiac growth during murine cardiogenesis.Development. 2004; 131: 2219-2231Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar) and its role in cardiac physiology is not known. However, increased BMP10 expression was observed in the hypertrophied ventricles in a rat model of hypertension (4Nakano N. Hori H. Abe M. Shibata H. Arimura T. Sasaoka T. Sawabe M. Chida K. Arai T. Nakahara K. Kubo T. Sugimoto K. Katsuya T. Ogihara T. Doi Y. Izumi T. Kimura A. Interaction of BMP10 with Tcap may modulate the course of hypertensive cardiac hypertrophy.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 293: H3396-H3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Such restricted and highly regulated expression of BMP10 in adult hearts strongly suggests that it plays an important role in physiology. To better define the function of BMP10 in vivo, it is essential to identify whether the atrium-secreted BMP10 is fully active or under additional regulation at the protein level. BMP10 is a member of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily. These ligands initiate cellular signaling by forming a signaling complex comprising two type I and two type II receptors, both of which are serine/threonine kinases. Upon signaling complex formation, the type I receptor is activated due to the phosphorylation by the constitutively active type II receptor, and phosphorylates the downstream transcription factors to control gene expression. There are five type I receptors: activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), ALK2, ALK3, ALK6, and ALK7, and three type II receptors: BMP receptor type II (BMPR-II), activin receptor type IIA (ActR-IIA), and ActR-IIB, that mediate BMP signaling. BMP9 and BMP10 belong to the same subgroup of the TGFβ superfamily based on amino acid sequence similarities (5Mazerbourg S. Sangkuhl K. Luo C.W. Sudo S. Klein C. Hsueh A.J.

Chem. 2005; 280: 32122-32132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and they are also the only two known ligands that can specifically activate ALK1. The ALK1-mediated signaling pathway plays important roles in normal and tumor angiogenesis and ALK1-Fc (Dalantercept, ALK1 extracellular domain-Fc fusion protein acting as a ligand trap) is currently in clinical trials for treating solid tumors (6Bendell J.C. Gordon M.S. Hurwitz H.I. Jones S.F. Mendelson D.S. Blobe G.C. Agarwal N. Condon C.H. Wilson D. Pearsall A.E. Yang Y. McClure T. Attie K.M. Sherman M.L. Sharma S.

Cancer Res. 2014; 20: 480-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since ALK1 is almost exclusively expressed on vascular endothelial cells (7Seki T. Yun J. Oh S.P. Arterial endothelium-specific activin receptor-like kinase 1 expression suggests its role in arterialization and vascular remodeling.Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 682-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), BMP9 and BMP10 signaling pathways are likely to play important roles in endothelial cell biology. TGFβ/BMP family ligands are synthesized as the pre-proprotein and processed into the prodomain and mature growth factor domain (GFD). Two major roles have been described for the prodomains. First, they interact with fibrillin-1 or other extracellular matrix components to target the growth factors to the specific extracellular space (8Sengle G. Ono R.N. Sasaki T. Sakai L.Y.

Chem. 2011; 286: 5087-5099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Secondly, the prodomain can regulate the activity of the mature growth factor by either conferring latency to the growth factor (9Shi M. Zhu J. Wang R. Chen X. Mi L. Walz T. Springer T.A. Latent TGF-β structure and activation.Nature. 2011; 474: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 10Wolfman N.M. McPherron A.C. Pappano W.N. Davies M.V. Song K. Tomkinson K.N. Wright J.F.

For example, prodomain-bound TGFβ and myostatin exist in latent forms and require further mechanisms to activate their signaling activity, such as the proteolytic cleavage of prodomain by BMP1 (10Wolfman N.M.

Travis M.A. TGFβ: a sleeping giant awoken by integrins.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2011; 36: 47-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, the prodomains of BMP4, 5, and 7 have been shown to bind to their cognate GFD with very high affinities, but do not affect their signaling activity (8Sengle G. Ono R.N. Sasaki T. Sakai L.Y. Prodomains of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members specify different functions: extracellular matrix interactions and growth factor bioavailability.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5087-5099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, using a mouse C2C12 myoblast cell-based activity assay with inhibitor of DNA-binding 3 (ID3) gene induction as a readout, the prodomain from BMP10 has been shown to potently inhibit BMP10 activity, and it was thus proposed that the pBMP10 complex might be similar to TGFβ and myostatin in that it is latent and requires additional factors to achieve activation (8Sengle G. Ono R.N. Sasaki T. Sakai L.Y. Prodomains of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members specify different functions: extracellular matrix interactions and growth factor bioavailability.J.

Apparently consistent with this observation, BMP10 GFD protein has been detected in human and mouse sera by ELISA (12Ricard N. Ciais D. Levet S. Subileau M. Mallet C. Zimmers T.A. Lee S.J. Bidart M.

This controversy on circulating BMP10 activity needs to be resolved since it is difficult to study BMP10 function in vivo without knowing whether there are additional activation mechanisms involved. Extensive studies on BMP9 have been reported in the past decade. It has been shown that BMP9 is a vascular quiescence factor, circulating at active concentrations, which inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and VEGF-induced angiogenesis (14Bidart M. Ricard N.

In contrast, studies on BMP10 are more limited, partially because its activity has not been consistently detected in human serum or plasma. Interestingly, using BMP10 GFD, in vitro cell biology studies show that BMP10 regulates a similar set of genes to BMP9, and with similar potency (12Ricard N. Ciais D. Levet S. Subileau M. Mallet C.

More intriguingly, BMP9 null mice are viable and it has been proposed that BMP9 and BMP10 can mediate functionally redundant signals in vivo and BMP10 can substitute BMP9 in postnatal retinal vascular remodeling (12Ricard N. Ciais D. Levet S. Subileau M. Mallet C. Zimmers T.A. Lee S.J. Bidart M. Feige J.J. Bailly S. BMP9 and BMP10 are critical for postnatal retinal vascular remodeling.Blood. 2012; 119: 6162-6171Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast, BMP9 cannot replace BMP10 in cardiac development even when it is expressed under a BMP10 promoter, indicating a unique signaling capacity of BMP10 in cardiac development (16Chen H. Brady Ridgway J. Sai T. Lai J. Warming S. Chen H. Roose-Girma M. Zhang G. Shou W. Yan M. Context-dependent signaling defines roles of BMP9 and BMP10 in embryonic and postnatal development.Proc. Natl.

This implies that either circulating BMP10 is active, or an additional BMP10 activation mechanism is in place in the BMP9−/− mice. Whether the pBMP10 complex is latent or biologically active is directly relevant to this question. More importantly, if pBMP10 is not latent, the high level expression of BMP10 in the adult right atrium might indicate an important physiological role for BMP10 in the adult heart that is yet to be identified. In addition, whether pBMP10 is active or not is of significant translational interest. For example, based on the observation that the prodomain is inhibitory, it has been proposed that the BMP10 prodomain could be developed into a ligand trap for anti-tumor therapy (8Sengle G. Ono R.N. Sasaki T. Sakai L.Y. Prodomains of transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) superfamily members specify different functions: extracellular matrix interactions and growth factor bioavailability.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 5087-5099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if pBMP10 itself is active, it might have therapeutic potential, because administration of the ALK1-specific ligand, BMP9, has been shown to be beneficial in preclinical models of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (21Long L. Ormiston M.L. Yang X. Southwood M. Gräf S. Machado R.D. Mueller M. Kinzel B. Yung L.M. Wilkinson J.M. Moore S.D. Drake K.M. Aldred M.A. Yu P.B. Upton P.D. Morrell N.W. Selective enhancement of endothelial BMPR-II with BMP9 reverses pulmonary arterial hypertension.Nat. Med. 2015; 21: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). In this report, we showed that the prodomain of BMP10 did not inhibit its activity in multiple endothelial cell lines. In addition, recombinant human pBMP10 expressed in mammalian cells and purified under native conditions was fully active, despite pBMP10 being a very stable complex. Furthermore, we provided evidence that BMP10 derived from endogenous sources, including cultured mouse right atrium or human plasma, was fully active on endothelial cells. Finally, we demonstrated that active BMP10 secreted from the mouse right atrium was the prodomain-bound complex. Anti-BMP9 antibody (MAB3209), anti-BMP10 antibody (MAB2926), BMP10 prodomain (3956-BP-050), anti-BMP10 propeptide antibody (AF3956), biotinylated anti-BMP10 propeptide antibody (BAF3956), ALK1-Fc (370-AL), human BMP10 GFD (2926-BP-025) were all purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. Anti-phosphoSmad1/5/8 and anti-phosphoSmad1/5 antibody were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-ID1 (M085) and anti-ID3 (M100) antibodies were purchased from CalBioreagents (San Mateo, CA). HiTrap Q FF and Superdex 200 10/30 columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. Human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs) and endothelial growth medium were purchased from Lonza, UK. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were purchased from PromoCell. All other tissue culture medium were purchased from Life Technologies. All plasmid and RNA purification kits were purchased from Qiagen. The Gel Filtration Calibration Kit was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Because of different cells having different sensitivities to BMP10, 10 ng/ml of BMP10 was used to treat C2C12 mouse myoblasts and 1 ng/ml used for endothelial cells. BMP10 GFD was pre-incubated with a 4-fold increased molar ratio of BMP10 prodomain with 0.5% (v/v) BSA as a carrier protein. The mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature before being added dropwise onto serum-starved cells. Cells were snap-frozen after 1 h of treatment and harvested in SDS-lysis buffer for subsequent immunoblot analysis as described previously (22Wei Z. Salmon R.M. Upton P.D. Morrell N.W. Li W. Regulation of bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) by redox-dependent proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 31150-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Human full-length proBMP10 cDNA was cloned into pCEP4 between XhoI and BamHI sites and verified by DNA sequencing. Plasmids containing proBMP10 were transfected into HEK EBNA cells using polyethylenimine as described previously (22Wei Z. Salmon R.M. Upton P.D. Morrell N.W. Li W. Regulation of bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) by redox-dependent proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 31150-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To facilitate processing, human full-length furin cDNA, cloned in the same vector, was co-transfected. To purify pBMP10, 5 liters of conditioned medium were loaded onto a 100 ml of Q Sepharose column, pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, and bound proteins were washed and eluted using NaCl gradients from 100 mm to 2 m. After another step of Q-Sepharose high performance column separation, fractions containing pBMP10 were pooled, concentrated in a VivaSpin column, and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 200 pg column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing pBMP10 were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8, 25 mm NaCl and further purified on a MonoP 5/200 GL column pre-equilibrated in 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.8. A final Superdex 200 column, pre-equilibrated in 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, was used to separate the pBMP10 from excess prodomain. To compare the activity of in-house purified pBMP10 with the commercial BMP10 GFD from R&D Systems, pBMP10 was quantified as the concentration of mature BMP10 GFD in two steps. In the initial step, pBMP10 was quantified by Coomassie Blue staining on an SDS-PAGE using BSA as a standard. The result of this initial quantification was used as a guide to prepare the samples in the second round of quantification using immunoblotting and commercial BMP10 GFD as a standard. The concentrations of pBMP10 in all the cell assays described here refer to the concentrations of mature GFD in the pBMP10 complex. Human BMPR2 (NM_001204) ECD, containing residues 27–150, was cloned into pET39b (Novagen) between NcoI and NotI sites to generate a construct expressing DsbA-(His)6-BMPR2 ECD fusion protein. A TEV protease (Tobacco Etch Virus nuclear inclusion A endopeptidase) cleavage site was introduced at the N terminus of BMPR2 ECD to facilitate the cleavage of the fusion protein. The insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid was transformed into bacterial strain Rosetta DE3 for protein expression. In brief, cells were grown at 37 °C until mid-log phase followed by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside induction at 25 °C overnight. Total proteins in the periplasmic compartment were extracted following the pET System Manual (Novagen) and applied to a 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled, dialyzed into TBS, and incubated with His-tagged TEV protease overnight before being loaded again onto a precharged nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column to remove the DsbA tag and TEV protease. BMPR-II ECD, which was in the flowthrough of the column, was concentrated and further purified on a S75 gel filtration chromatography. The final BMPR-II is over 99% pure on an SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Surgical samples of tissues were obtained from normal hearts not suitable for further transplantation with informed consent from the Papworth Hospital Research Tissue Bank and experiments performed with local ethical approval (REC 05/Q0104/142). Mouse left atrium (LA) and right atrium (RA) were dissected from adult C57BL/6 mice (12–16 weeks old) and either snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen for RNA extraction or kept in ice-cold PBS for ex vivo cultures. All animal procedures in this study were carried out according to Home Office regulations and approved by the local animal care committee. After two additional washing steps with PBS, pooled fresh atria were transferred into T25 flasks containing DMEM (0.8 ml medium per atrium, LA and RA from the same mouse were cultured in parallel) supplemented with Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Life Technologies). The ex vivo culture were kept at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Conditioned medium was harvested between 48 to 72 h and BMP activity in the conditioned medium was evaluated in the endothelial cell signaling assays in the presence or absence of anti-BMP9 antibody, anti-BMP10 antibody, or ALK1-Fc, respectively. Cells were grown in 6-well plates and serum-restricted overnight prior to treatments. At the end of time courses, cells were washed with PBS and snap-frozen on dry ice. Extraction of total RNA was performed using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). Total RNA from mouse atrium was extracted using RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription was carried out following the manufacturer's instructions (High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit, Applied Biosystems). Q-PCR reactions were prepared with 4.5 μl of diluted cDNA samples and 10.5 μl of master mix containing 7.5 μl of the SYBR Green Jumpstart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma-Aldrich), 200 nm of each forward and reverse primers and 10 nm of Rox Reference Dye. The following forward and reverse primers were used to amplify the corresponding human genes: ID1: 5′-CTGCTCTACGACATGAACGGC, 5′-TGACGTGCTGGAGAATCTCCA; β-2-microglobulin (B2M): 5′-CTCGCGCTACTCTCTCTTTCT, 5′-CATTCTCTGCTGGATGACGTG; BMPR2: 5′-CAAATCTGTGAGCCCAACAGTCAA, 5′-GAGGAAGAATAATCTGGATAAGGACCAAT. QuantiTect Q-PCR primers for human BMP10 (Hs_BMP10_1_SG), mouse BMP9 (Mm_Gdf2_1_SG), BMP10 (Mm_Bmp10_1_SG) and B2M (Mm_B2m_2_SG) were purchased from Qiagen. Reactions were amplified on a StepOnePlusTMthermal cycler (Applied Biosystems) and the relative expression of target mRNAs was normalized to B2M using the ΔΔCT method, expressed as the fold-change relative to control samples, and shown as mean ± S.E. where applicable. A Superdex 200 10/300 GL column was equilibrated in PBS and proteins of known molecular weights from the Gel Filtration Calibration Kit were fractionated to obtain the elution volumes for proteins of different sizes. Conditioned medium from RA or diluted in-house purified pBMP10 were passed though the same column under identical conditions, and the eluate was collected as 250-μl fractions after the void volume. Every second fraction was assessed for BMP10-activity using BMP-responsive element (BRE)-Luciferase Assay in C2C12 cells as described previously (22Wei Z. Salmon R.M. Upton P.D. Morrell N.W. Li W. Regulation of bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9) by redox-dependent proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 31150-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: C2C12 cells were seeded in 24-well plate at 3 × 104 cells/well. All wells were transfected with 400 ng of plasmid containing BRE-luciferase (kind gift from Professor P. ten Dijke), 40 ng of Renilla luciferase, and 5 ng of pcDNA3:hALK1 per well. Cells were quiesced for 16 h in serum-free DMEM and then treated in triplicate for 6 h with an appropriate dilution of each fraction. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured and analyzed as described previously. A high binding 96-well ELISA plate was coated with anti-BMP10 monoclonal antibody (2 μg/ml) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. After washing with PBS, wells were blocked with 1% BSA in PBS for 2 h, washed with PBS, and 100 μl of undiluted fractions were applied in duplicate. After 2 h of incubation at room temperature, wells were washed again and probed with biotinylated anti-BMP10 propeptide antibody (0.4 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature. After further washing, ExtraAvidin-Alkaline Phosphatase conjugate (Sigma Aldrich E2636, 1:400 in 1% BSA/PBS) was applied. Two hours later, wells were washed and pNPP solution (Sigma Aldrich NP2640) was added. Development was carried out in the dark at 37 °C with readings taken every 15 min at 405 nm in a Bio-Rad 680 microplate reader until the signals were fully developed. Based on initial titrations (data not shown), 1% (v/v) freshly frozen human plasma or 0.4% (v/v) mouse RA-conditional medium was used in the assays. Stimuli were mixed with neutralizing reagents or PBS as controls and pre-incubated for 1 h at room temperature to allow neutralization. The solution was added"
https://openalex.org/W2265872837,"Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are widespread units on genome sequences, and play many important roles in plants. In order to reveal the evolution of plant genomes, we investigated the evolutionary regularities of SSRs during the evolution of plant species and the plant kingdom by analysis of twelve sequenced plant genome sequences. First, in the twelve studied plant genomes, the main SSRs were those which contain repeats of 1–3 nucleotides combination. Second, in mononucleotide SSRs, the A/T percentage gradually increased along with the evolution of plants (except for P. patens). With the increase of SSRs repeat number the percentage of A/T in C. reinhardtii had no significant change, while the percentage of A/T in terrestrial plants species gradually declined. Third, in dinucleotide SSRs, the percentage of AT/TA increased along with the evolution of plant kingdom and the repeat number increased in terrestrial plants species. This trend was more obvious in dicotyledon than monocotyledon. The percentage of CG/GC showed the opposite pattern to the AT/TA. Forth, in trinucleotide SSRs, the percentages of combinations including two or three A/T were in a rising trend along with the evolution of plant kingdom; meanwhile with the increase of SSRs repeat number in plants species, different species chose different combinations as dominant SSRs. SSRs in C. reinhardtii, P. patens, Z. mays and A. thaliana showed their specific patterns related to evolutionary position or specific changes of genome sequences. The results showed that, SSRs not only had the general pattern in the evolution of plant kingdom, but also were associated with the evolution of the specific genome sequence. The study of the evolutionary regularities of SSRs provided new insights for the analysis of the plant genome evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2497663452,"Background Research has shown that health differences exist between urban and rural areas. Most studies conducted, however, have focused on single health outcomes and have not assessed to what extent the association of urbanity with health is explained by population composition or socioeconomic status of the area. Our aim is to investigate associations of urbanity with four different health outcomes (i.e. lung function, metabolic syndrome, depression and anxiety) and to assess whether these associations are independent of residents’ characteristics and area socioeconomic status. Methods Our study population consisted of 74,733 individuals (42% males, mean age 43.8) who were part of the baseline sample of the LifeLines Cohort Study. Health outcomes were objectively measured with spirometry, a physical examination, laboratory blood analyses, and a psychiatric interview. Using multilevel linear and logistic regression models, associations of urbanity with lung function, and prevalence of metabolic syndrome, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder were assessed. All models were sequentially adjusted for age, sex, highest education, household equivalent income, smoking, physical activity, and mean neighborhood income. Results As compared with individuals living in rural areas, those in semi-urban or urban areas had a poorer lung function (β -1.62, 95% CI -2.07;-1.16), and higher prevalence of major depressive disorder (OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.35;2.00), and generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35;1.84). Prevalence of metabolic syndrome, however, was lower in urban areas (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44;0.59). These associations were only partly explained by differences in residents’ demographic, socioeconomic and lifestyle characteristics and socioeconomic status of the areas. Conclusions Our results suggest a differential health impact of urbanity according to type of disease. Living in an urban environment appears to be beneficial for cardiometabolic health but to have a detrimental impact on respiratory function and mental health. Future research should investigate which underlying mechanisms explain the differential health impact of urbanity."
https://openalex.org/W2188007068,"Objective To quantify the impact of service provider characteristics on young people’s choice of family planning (FP) service provider in rural Malawi in order to identify strategies for increasing access and uptake of FP among youth. Methods and Findings A discrete choice experiment was developed to assess the relative impact of service characteristics on preferences for FP service providers among young people (aged 15–24). Four alternative providers were included (government facility, private facility, outreach and community based distribution of FP) and described by six attributes (the distance between participants’ home and the service delivery point, frequency of service delivery, waiting time at the facility, service providers’ attitude, availability of FP commodities and price). A random parameters logit model was used to estimate preferences for service providers and the likely uptake of services following the expansion of outreach and community based distribution (CBDA) services. In the choice experiment young people were twice as likely to choose a friendly provider (government service odds ratio [OR] = 2.45, p<0.01; private service OR = 1.99, p<0.01; CBDA OR = 1.88, p<0.01) and more than two to three times more likely to choose a provider with an adequate supply of FP commodities (government service OR = 2.48, p<0.01; private service OR = 2.33, p<0.01; CBDA = 3.85, p<0.01). Uptake of community based services was greater than facility based services across a variety of simulated service scenarios indicating that such services may be an effective means of expanding access for youth in rural areas and an important tool for increasing service uptake among youth. Conclusions Ensuring that services are acceptable to young people may require additional training for service providers in order to ensure that all providers are friendly and non-judgemental when dealing with younger clients and to ensure that supplies are consistently available."
https://openalex.org/W2188669773,"Deregulated cell migration and invasion are hallmarks of metastatic cancer cells. Phosphorylation on residue Ser5 of the actin-bundling protein L-plastin activates L-plastin and has been reported to be crucial for invasion and metastasis. Here, we investigate signal transduction leading to L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation using 4 human breast cancer cell lines. Whole-genome microarray analysis comparing cell lines with different invasive capacities and corresponding variations in L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation level revealed that genes of the ERK/MAPK pathway are differentially expressed. It is noteworthy that in vitro kinase assays showed that ERK/MAPK pathway downstream ribosomal protein S6 kinases α-1 (RSK1) and α-3 (RSK2) are able to directly phosphorylate L-plastin on Ser5. Small interfering RNA- or short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown and activation/inhibition studies followed by immunoblot analysis and computational modeling confirmed that ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) is an essential activator of L-plastin. Migration and invasion assays showed that RSK knockdown led to a decrease of up to 30% of migration and invasion of MDA-MB-435S cells. Although the presence of L-plastin was not necessary for migration/invasion of these cells, immunofluorescence assays illustrated RSK-dependent recruitment of Ser5-phosphorylated L-plastin to migratory structures. Altogether, we provide evidence that the ERK/MAPK pathway is involved in L-plastin Ser5 phosphorylation in breast cancer cells with RSK1 and RSK2 kinases able to directly phosphorylate L-plastin residue Ser5."
https://openalex.org/W2186776201,"Purpose To determine whether 5-methylenetetrahydrofolate (MTHF) is more effective than folic acid supplementation in treatment of recurrent abortion in different MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. Methods A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted April 2011-September 2014 in recurrent abortion clinics in Tehran, Iran. The participants were women with three or more idiopathic recurrent abortion, aged 20 to 45 years. Two hundred and twenty eligible women who consented to participate were randomly assigned to receive either folic acid or 5-MTHF according to the stratified blocked randomization by age and the number of previous abortions. Participants took daily 1 mg 5-methylentetrahydrofolate or 1 mg folic acid from at least 8 weeks before conception to the 20th week of the pregnancy. The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy rate at 20th week of pregnancy, and the secondary outcomes were serum folate and homocysteine at the baseline, after 8 weeks, and at the gestational age of 4, 8, 12, and 20 weeks, MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C polymorphisms. Results There was no significant difference in abortion rate between two groups. Serum folate increased significantly in both groups over time; these changes were significantly higher in the group receiving 5-MTHF than the group receiving folic acid (value = 2.39, p<00.1) and the result was the same by considering the time (value = 1.24, p<0.01). Plasma tHcys decreased significantly in both groups over time; however these changes were not significantly different between the groups (value = 0.01, p = 0.47). Conclusion The results do not support any beneficial effect of 5-MTHF vs. folate supplementation in women with recurrent abortion with any MTHFR C677T and/or A1298C polymorphism.

https://openalex.org/W2186556741,"To analyze the impact of the 11q deleted (11q-) cells in CLL patients on the time to first therapy (TFT) and overall survival (OS), 2,493 patients with CLL were studied. 242 patients (9.7%) had 11q-. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies showed a threshold of 40% of deleted cells to be optimal for showing that clinical differences in terms of TFT and OS within 11q- CLLs. In patients with ≥40% of losses in 11q (11q-H) (74%), the median TFT was 19 months compared with 44 months in CLL patients with <40% del(11q) (11q-L) (P<0.0001). In the multivariate analysis, only the presence of 11q-L, mutated IGHV status, early Binet stage and absence of extended lymphadenopathy were associated with longer TFT. Patients with 11q-H had an OS of 90 months, while in the 11q-L group the OS was not reached (P = 0.008). The absence of splenomegaly (P = 0.02), low LDH (P = 0.018) or β2M (P = 0.006), and the presence of 11q-L (P = 0.003) were associated with a longer OS. In addition, to detect the presence of mutations in the ATM, TP53, NOTCH1, SF3B1, MYD88, FBXW7, XPO1 and BIRC3 genes, a select cohort of CLL patients with losses in 11q was sequenced by next-generation sequencing of amplicons. Eighty % of CLLs with 11q- showed mutations and fewer patients with low frequencies of 11q- had mutations among genes examined (50% vs 94.1%, P = 0.023). In summary, CLL patients with <40% of 11q- had a long TFT and OS that could be associated with the presence of fewer mutated genes."
https://openalex.org/W2293294922,"Structure of Cupiennius salei venom hyaluronidase Hyaluronidases are important venom components acting as spreading factor of toxic compounds. In several studies this spreading effect was tested on vertebrate tissue. However, data about the spreading activity on invertebrates, the main prey organisms of spiders, are lacking. Here, a hyaluronidase-like enzyme was isolated from the venom of the spider Cupiennius salei. The amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined by cDNA analysis of the venom gland transcriptome and confirmed by protein analysis. Two complex N-linked glycans akin to honey bee hyaluronidase glycosylations, were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. A C-terminal EGF-like domain was identified in spider hyaluronidase using InterPro. The spider hyaluronidase-like enzyme showed maximal activity at acidic pH, between 40–60°C, and 0.2 M KCl. Divalent ions did not enhance HA degradation activity, indicating that they are not recruited for catalysis. Function of venom hyaluronidases Besides hyaluronan, the enzyme degrades chondroitin sulfate A, whereas heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate are not affected. The end products of hyaluronan degradation are tetramers, whereas chondroitin sulfate A is mainly degraded to hexamers. Identification of terminal N-acetylglucosamine or N-acetylgalactosamine at the reducing end of the oligomers identified the enzyme as an endo-β-N-acetyl-D-hexosaminidase hydrolase. The spreading effect of the hyaluronidase-like enzyme on invertebrate tissue was studied by coinjection of the enzyme with the Cupiennius salei main neurotoxin CsTx-1 into Drosophila flies. The enzyme significantly enhances the neurotoxic activity of CsTx-1. Comparative substrate degradation tests with hyaluronan, chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate, and heparan sulfate with venoms from 39 spider species from 21 families identified some spider families (Atypidae, Eresidae, Araneidae and Nephilidae) without activity of hyaluronidase-like enzymes. This is interpreted as a loss of this enzyme and fits quite well the current phylogenetic idea on a more isolated position of these families and can perhaps be explained by specialized prey catching techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2184814300,"Glucose is a primary stimulator of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. High concentration of glucose has been thought to exert its action solely through its metabolism. In this regard, we have recently reported that glucose also activates a cell-surface glucose-sensing receptor and facilitates its own metabolism. In the present study, we investigated whether glucose activates the glucose-sensing receptor and elicits receptor-mediated rapid actions. In MIN6 cells and isolated mouse β-cells, glucose induced triphasic changes in cytoplasmic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]c); glucose evoked an immediate elevation of [Ca(2+)]c, which was followed by a decrease in [Ca(2+)]c, and after a certain lag period it induced large oscillatory elevations of [Ca(2+)]c. Initial rapid peak and subsequent reduction of [Ca(2+)]c were independent of glucose metabolism and reproduced by a nonmetabolizable glucose analogue. These signals were also blocked by an inhibitor of T1R3, a subunit of the glucose-sensing receptor, and by deletion of the T1R3 gene. Besides Ca(2+), glucose also induced an immediate and sustained elevation of intracellular cAMP ([cAMP]c). The elevation of [cAMP]c was blocked by transduction of the dominant-negative Gs, and deletion of the T1R3 gene. These results indicate that glucose induces rapid changes in [Ca(2+)]c and [cAMP]c by activating the cell-surface glucose-sensing receptor. Hence, glucose generates rapid intracellular signals by activating the cell-surface receptor."

https://openalex.org/W2193491018,"Heat shock protein (HSP)90 inhibitors have shown significant anti-tumor activities in preclinical settings in both solid and hematological tumors. We previously reported that the novel, orally available HSP90α/β inhibitor TAS-116 shows significant anti-MM activities. In this study, we further examined the combination effect of TAS-116 with a RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway inhibitor in RAS- or BRAF-mutated MM cell lines. TAS-116 monotherapy significantly inhibited growth of RAS-mutated MM cell lines and was associated with decreased expression of downstream target proteins of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway. Moreover, TAS-116 showed synergistic growth inhibitory effects with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor tipifarnib, the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib, and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. Importantly, treatment with these inhibitors paradoxically enhanced p-C-Raf, p-MEK, and p-ERK activity, which was abrogated by TAS-116. TAS-116 also enhanced dabrafenib-induced MM cytotoxicity associated with mitochondrial damage-induced apoptosis, even in the BRAF-mutated U266 MM cell line. This enhanced apoptosis in RAS-mutated MM triggered by combination treatment was observed even in the presence of bone marrow stromal cells. Taken together, our results provide the rationale for novel combination treatment with HSP90α/β inhibitor and RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway inhibitors to improve outcomes in patients with in RAS- or BRAF-mutated MM."
https://openalex.org/W2187547792,"Background Changes in tumor DNA mutation status during chemotherapy can provide insights into tumor biology and drug resistance. The purpose of this study is to analyse the presence or absence of mutations in cancer-related genes using baseline breast tumor samples and those obtained after exposure to one cycle of chemotherapy to determine if any differences exist, and to correlate these differences with clinical and pathological features. Methods Paired breast tumor core biopsies obtained pre- and post-first cycle doxorubicin (n = 18) or docetaxel (n = 22) in treatment-naïve breast cancer patients were analysed for 238 mutations in 19 cancer-related genes by the Sequenom Oncocarta assay. Results Median age of patients was 48 years (range 32–64); 55% had estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and 60% had tumor reduction ≥25% after cycle 1. Mutations were detected in 10/40 (25%) pre-treatment and 11/40 (28%) post-treatment samples. Four mutation pattern categories were identified based on tumor mutation status pre- → post-treatment: wildtype (WT)→WT, n = 24; mutant (MT)→MT, n = 5; MT→WT, n = 5; WT→MT, n = 6. Overall, the majority of tumors were WT at baseline (30/40, 75%), of which 6/30 (20%) acquired new mutations after chemotherapy. Pre-treatment mutations were predominantly in PIK3CA (8/10, 80%), while post-treatment mutations were distributed in PIK3CA, EGFR, PDGFRA, ABL1 and MET. All 6 WT→MT cases were treated with docetaxel. Higher mutant allele frequency in baseline MT tumors (n = 10; PIK3CA mutations n = 8) correlated with less tumor reduction after cycle 1 chemotherapy (R = -0.667, p = 0.035). No other associations were observed between mutation pattern category with treatment, clinicopathological features, and tumor response or survival. Conclusion Tumor mutational profiles can change as quickly as after one cycle of chemotherapy in breast cancer. Understanding of these changes can provide insights on potential therapeutic options in residual resistant tumors. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00212082"

The peroxisome number and metabolism strongly increased in chondrocytes during endochondral ossification from the reserve to the hypertrophic zone, whereas in bone, metabolically active osteoblasts contained a higher numerical abundance of this organelle than osteocytes. The high abundance of peroxisomes in these skeletal cell types is reflected by high levels of Pex11β gene expression. During culture, calvarial pre-osteoblasts differentiated into secretory osteoblasts accompanied by peroxisome proliferation and increased levels of peroxisomal genes and proteins. Since many peroxisomal genes contain a PPAR-responsive element, we analyzed the gene expression of PPARɑ/ß/ɣ in calvarial osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 cells, revealing higher levels for PPARß than for PPARɑ and PPARɣ. Treatment with different PPAR agonists and antagonists not only changed the peroxisomal compartment and associated gene expression, but also induced complex alterations of the gene expression patterns of the other PPAR family members. Studies in M3CT3-E1 cells showed that the PPARß agonist GW0742 activated the PPRE-mediated luciferase expression and up-regulated peroxisomal gene transcription (Pex11, Pex13, Pex14, Acox1 and Cat), whereas the PPARß antagonist GSK0660 led to repression of the PPRE and a decrease of the corresponding mRNA levels. In the same way, treatment of calvarial osteoblasts with GW0742 increased in peroxisome number and related gene expression and accelerated osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, our results suggest that PPARß regulates the numerical abundance and metabolic function of peroxisomes via Pex11ß in parallel to osteoblast differentiation."

One prediction, based on evolutionary considerations, was that reminders of death increase the value of the present. Another prediction, based in part on construal level theory, was that reminders of death increase the value of the future. One-hundred eighteen participants thought about personal mortality or a control topic and then completed an inter-temporal choice task pitting the chance to gain $50 now against increasingly attractive rewards three months later. Consistent with the hypothesis inspired by construal theory, participants in the mortality salience condition traded $50 now for $66.67 in three months, whereas participants in the dental pain salience condition required $72.84 in three months in lieu of $50 now. Thus, participants in the mortality salience condition discounted future monetary gains less than other participants, suggesting that thoughts of death may increase the subjective value of the future."
https://openalex.org/W2185125703,"Aging is associated with an increased risk of seizures/epilepsy. Stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and cardiac arrest related brain injury are two major causative factors for seizure development in this patient population. With either etiology, seizures are a poor prognostic factor. In spite of this, the underlying pathophysiology of seizure development is not well understood. In addition, a standardized treatment regimen with anticonvulsants and outcome assessments following treatment has yet to be established for these post-ischemic seizures. Previous studies have modeled post-ischemic seizures in adult rodents, but similar studies in aging/aged animals, a group that mirrors a higher risk elderly population, remain sparse. Our study therefore aimed to investigate early-onset seizures in aging animals using a hypoxia-ischemia (HI) model. Male C57 black mice 18-20-month-old underwent a unilateral occlusion of the common carotid artery followed by a systemic hypoxic episode (8% O2 for 30 min). Early-onset seizures were detected using combined behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring. Brain injury was assessed histologically at different times post HI. Convulsive seizures were observed in 65% of aging mice post-HI but not in control aging mice following either sham surgery or hypoxia alone. These seizures typically occurred within hours of HI and behaviorally consisted of jumping, fast running, barrel-rolling, and/or falling (loss of the righting reflex) with limb spasms. No evident discharges during any convulsive seizures were seen on cortical-hippocampal EEG recordings. Seizure development was closely associated with acute mortality and severe brain injury on brain histological analysis. Intra-peritoneal injections of lorazepam and fosphenytoin suppressed seizures and improved survival but only when applied prior to seizure onset and not after. These findings together suggest that seizures are a major contributing factor to acute mortality in aging mice following severe brain ischemia and that early anticonvulsive treatment may prevent seizure genesis and improve overall outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W2189436152,"Nitrate (NO3−) and nitrite (NO2−) are the physiological sources of nitric oxide (NO), a key biological messenger molecule. NO3−/NO2− exerts a beneficial impact on NO homeostasis and its related cardiovascular functions. To visualize the physiological dynamics of NO3−/NO2− for assessing the precise roles of these anions, we developed a genetically encoded intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based indicator, named sNOOOpy (sensor for NO3−/NO2− in physiology), by employing NO3−/NO2−-induced dissociation of NasST involved in the denitrification system of rhizobia. The in vitro use of sNOOOpy shows high specificity for NO3− and NO2−, and its FRET signal is changed in response to NO3−/NO2− in the micromolar range. Furthermore, both an increase and decrease in cellular NO3− concentration can be detected. sNOOOpy is very simple and potentially applicable to a wide variety of living cells and is expected to provide insights into NO3−/NO2− dynamics in various organisms, including plants and animals."

https://openalex.org/W2182351176,"Soil hydraulic principles suggest that post-infiltration hypoxic conditions would be induced in the plant root-zone for drip-irrigated tomato production in small pots filled with natural soil. No previous study specifically examined the response of tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum) at different growth stages to low soil aeration under these conditions. A 2 × 6 factorial experiment was conducted to quantify effects of no post-infiltration soil aeration versus aeration during 5 different periods (namely 27-33, 34-57, 58-85, 86-99, and 27-99 days after sowing), on growth and fruit quality of potted single tomato plants that were sub-surface trickle-irrigated every 2 days at 2 levels. Soil was aerated by injecting 2.5 liters of air into each pot through the drip tubing immediately after irrigation. Results showed that post-infiltration aeration, especially during the fruit setting (34-57 DAS) and enlargement (58-85 DAS) growth stages, can positively influence the yield, root dry weight and activity, and the nutritional (soluble solids and vitamin C content), taste (titratable acidity), and market quality (shape and firmness) of the tomato fruits. Interactions between irrigation level and post-infiltration aeration on some of these fruit quality parameters indicated a need for further study on the dynamic interplay of air and water in the root zone of the plants under the conditions of this experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2185841205,"Treatment initiation rates following fragility fractures have often been reported to be low and in recent years numerous programs have been implemented worldwide to increase them. This study aimed at describing osteoporosis (OP) treatment initiation in a representative sample of women who were hospitalized for a distal forearm fracture (DFF) or proximal humerus fracture (PHF) in 2009-2011 in France. The data source was a nationwide sample of 600,000 individuals, extracted from the French National Insurance Healthcare System database. All women aged 50 years and older who were hospitalized for a DFF or PHF between 2009 and 2011 and who had not received any OP treatment in the preceding 12 months were included in a retrospective cohort study. OP treatments initiated during the year following the fracture were analyzed. From 2009 to 2011, 729 women were hospitalized for a DFF or a PHF and 284 were on OP treatment at the time of the fracture occurrence. Among the 445 women who had no prevalent OP treatment, 131 (29.4%) received supplementation treatment only (vitamin D and/or calcium) and 42 (9.4%) received a pharmacologic OP treatment in the year following their fracture. Pharmacological OP treatments included bisphosphonates (n = 21), strontium ranelate (n = 14), hormone replacement therapy (n = 4), or raloxifene (n = 3). General practitioners prescribed 75% of initial OP treatments. Despite the guidelines published in 2006 and the numerous initiatives to promote post-fracture OP treatment, OP treatment initiation rate in women who were hospitalized for a fragility fracture remained low in 2009-2011 in France."

https://openalex.org/W2255437162,"Northern hemisphere rockweeds (Fucus) are thought to have evolved in the North Pacific and then spread to the North Atlantic following the opening of the Bering Strait. They have dispersed and widely speciated in the North Atlantic and its tributary seas. Fucus distichus is likely near the ancestral member of this genus, and studies have shown that there are several species/subspecies in this complex (i.e. F. evanescens and F. gardneri). We used phylogenetic and haplotype analyses to test the phylogenetic relationships and biogeography of F. distichus. Our data and subsequent analyses demonstrate that, unlike previous studies that lacked samples from an extensive geographical area of the Arctic and Subarctic, there is a distinct Arctic haplotype that is the source of subspecies in both the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Fucus distichus occupies a low tide zone habitat, and in Arctic/Subarctic regions it is adapted to the severe stress of sea ice coverage and disturbance during many months per year. We hypothesize that the very large geographic area of Arctic and Subarctic rocky shores available to this species during interglacials, supported by large Arctic/Subarctic fringe areas as well as unglaciated refugia during glacial cycles, provided a robust population and gene pool (described by the Thermogeographic Model). This gene pool dilutes that of the more fragmented and area-limited Temperate/Boreal area populations when they are brought together during glacial cycles. We suggest that similar subspecies complexes for a variety of Arctic/Subarctic shore biota should be examined further in this context, rather than arbitrarily being split up into numerous species."
https://openalex.org/W2269776196,"Proliferative retinopathic diseases often progress in 2 phases: initial regression of retinal vasculature (phase 1) followed by subsequent neovascularization (NV) (phase 2). The immune system has been shown to aid in vascular pruning in such retinopathies; however, little is known about the role of the alternative complement pathway in the initial vascular regression phase. Using a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), we observed that alternative complement pathway-deficient mice (Fb(-/-)) exhibited a mild decrease in vascular loss at postnatal day (P)8 compared with age- and strain-matched controls (P = 0.035). Laser capture microdissection was used to isolate the retinal blood vessels. Expression of the complement inhibitors Cd55 and Cd59 was significantly decreased in blood vessels isolated from hyperoxic retinas compared with those from normoxic control mice. Vegf expression was measured at P8 and found to be significantly lower in OIR mice than in normoxic control mice (P = 0.0048). Further examination of specific Vegf isoform expression revealed a significant decrease in Vegf120 (P = 0.00032) and Vegf188 (P = 0.0092). In conjunction with the major modulating effects of Vegf during early retinal vascular development, our data suggest a modest involvement of the alternative complement pathway in targeting vessels for regression in the initial vaso-obliteration stage of OIR."
https://openalex.org/W2275822324,"In sickle cell disease (SCD), treatment of recurrent vasoocclusive episodes, leading to pain crises and organ damage, is still a therapeutic challenge. Vasoocclusion is caused primarily by adherence of homozygous for hemoglobin S (SS) red blood cells (SSRBCs) and leukocytes to the endothelium. We tested the therapeutic benefits of MEK1/2 inhibitors in reversing vasoocclusion in nude and humanized SCD mouse models of acute vasoocclusive episodes using intravital microscopy. Administration of 0.2, 0.3, 1, or 2 mg/kg MEK1/2 inhibitor to TNF-α-pretreated nude mice before human SSRBC infusion inhibited SSRBC adhesion in inflamed vessels, prevented the progression of vasoocclusion, and reduced SSRBC organ sequestration. By use of a more clinically relevant protocol, 0.3 or 1 mg/kg MEK1/2 inhibitor given to TNF-α-pretreated nude mice after human SSRBC infusion and onset of vasoocclusion reversed SSRBC adhesion and vasoocclusion and restored blood flow. In SCD mice, 0.025, 0.05, or 0.1 mg/kg MEK1/2 inhibitor also reversed leukocyte and erythrocyte adhesion after the inflammatory trigger of vasoocclusion and improved microcirculatory blood flow. Cell adhesion was reversed by shedding of endothelial E-selectin, P-selectin, and αvβ3 integrin, and leukocyte CD44 and β2 integrin. Thus, MEK1/2 inhibitors, by targeting the adhesive function of SSRBCs and leukocytes, could represent a valuable therapeutic intervention for acute sickle cell vasoocclusive crises."

https://openalex.org/W2294730555,"Human embryonic stem cell differentiation towards various cell types belonging to ecto-, endo- and mesodermal cell lineages has been demonstrated, with high efficiency rates using standardized differentiation protocols. However, germ cell differentiation from human embryonic stem cells has been very inefficient so far. Even though the influence of various growth factors has been evaluated, the gene expression of different cell lines in relation to their differentiation potential has not yet been extensively examined. In this study, the potential of three male human embryonic stem cell lines to differentiate towards male gonadal cells was explored by analysing their gene expression profiles. The human embryonic stem cell lines were cultured for 14 days as monolayers on supporting human foreskin fibroblasts or as spheres in suspension, and were differentiated using BMP7, or spontaneous differentiation by omitting exogenous FGF2. TLDA analysis revealed that in the undifferentiated state, these cell lines have diverse mRNA profiles and exhibit significantly different potentials for differentiation towards the cell types present in the male gonads. This potential was associated with important factors directing the fate of the male primordial germ cells in vivo to form gonocytes, such as SOX17 or genes involved in the NODAL/ACTIVIN pathway, for example. Stimulation with BMP7 in suspension culture resulted in up-regulation of cytoplasmic SOX9 protein expression in all three lines. The observation that human embryonic stem cells differentiate towards germ and somatic cells after spontaneous and BMP7-induced stimulation in suspension emphasizes the important role of somatic cells in germ cell differentiation in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2184245599,"Vection, a feeling of self-motion while being physically stationary, and postural sway can be modulated by various visual factors. Moreover, vection and postural sway are often found to be closely related when modulated by such visual factors, suggesting a common neural mechanism. One well-known visual factor is the depth order of the stimulus. The density, i.e. number of objects per unit area, is proposed to interact with the depth order in the modulation of vection and postural sway, which has only been studied to a limited degree.We therefore exposed 17 participants to 18 different stimuli containing a stationary pattern and a pattern rotating around the naso-occipital axis. The density of both patterns was varied between 10 and 90%; the densities combined always added up to 100%. The rotating pattern occluded or was occluded by the stationary pattern, suggesting foreground or background motion, respectively. During pattern rotation participants reported vection by pressing a button, and postural sway was recorded using a force plate.Participants always reported more vection and swayed significantly more when rotation was perceived in the background and when the rotating pattern increased in density. As hypothesized, we found that the perceived depth order interacted with pattern density. A pattern rotating in the background with a density between 60 and 80% caused significantly more vection and postural sway than when it was perceived to rotate in the foreground.The findings suggest that the ratio between fore- and background pattern densities is an important factor in the interaction with the depth order, and it is not the density of rotating pattern per se. Moreover, the observation that vection and postural sway were modulated in a similar way points towards a common neural origin regulating both variables."
https://openalex.org/W2185720811,"Taxonomic delimitation of Disepalum (Annonaceae) is contentious, with some researchers favoring a narrow circumscription following segregation of the genus Enicosanthellum. We reconstruct the phylogeny of Disepalum and related taxa based on four chloroplast and two nuclear DNA regions as a framework for clarifying taxonomic delimitation and assessing evolutionary transitions in key morphological characters. Maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods resulted in a consistent, well-resolved and strongly supported topology. Disepalum s.l. is monophyletic and strongly supported, with Disepalum s.str. and Enicosanthellum retrieved as sister groups. Although this topology is consistent with both taxonomic delimitations, the distribution of morphological synapomorphies provides greater support for the inclusion of Enicosanthellum within Disepalum s.l. We propose a novel infrageneric classification with two subgenera. Subgen. Disepalum (= Disepalum s.str.) is supported by numerous synapomorphies, including the reduction of the calyx to two sepals and connation of petals. Subgen. Enicosanthellum lacks obvious morphological synapomorphies, but possesses several diagnostic characters (symplesiomorphies), including a trimerous calyx and free petals in two whorls. We evaluate changes in petal morphology in relation to hypotheses of the genetic control of floral development and suggest that the compression of two petal whorls into one and the associated fusion of contiguous petals may be associated with the loss of the pollination chamber, which in turn may be associated with a shift in primary pollinator. We also suggest that the formation of pollen octads may be selectively advantageous when pollinator visits are infrequent, although this would only be applicable if multiple ovules could be fertilized by each octad; since the flowers are apocarpous, this would require an extragynoecial compitum to enable intercarpellary growth of pollen tubes. We furthermore infer that the monocarp fruit stalks are likely to have evolved independently from those in other Annonaceae genera and may facilitate effective dispersal by providing a color contrast within the fruit."

The results revealed an improvement in T-cell proliferation activity and some other immunological indices. In addition, the intestinal microbiota changed, with an increase in Bifidobacterium and a decrease in Clostridium bacteria.

Methods and Materials A total of 140 lung cancer patients were included in this institutional review board approved study: 25 treated with DCAT, 70 with IMRT and 45 with VMAT. All plans were generated in a same commercial treatment planning system and have been clinically accepted and delivered. The dose distribution to the heart and the effects of tumor laterality, the irradiated heart volume and the beam-to-heart distance on the cardiac exposure were investigated. Results The mean dose to the heart among all 140 plans was 4.5 Gy. Specifically, the heart received on average 2.3, 5.2 and 4.6 Gy in the DCAT, IMRT and VMAT plans, respectively. The mean heart doses for the left and right lung tumors were 4.1 and 4.8 Gy, respectively. No patients died with evidence of cardiac disease. Three patients (2%) with preexisting cardiac condition developed cardiac disease after treatment. Furthermore, the cardiac exposure was found to increase linearly with the irradiated heart volume while decreasing exponentially with the beam-to-heart distance. Conclusions Compared to old technologies for lung cancer treatment, modern radiotherapy treatment modalities demonstrated better heart sparing. But the heart dose in lung cancer radiotherapy is still higher than that in the radiotherapy of breast cancer and Hodgkin’s disease where cardiac complications have been extensively studied. With strong correlations of mean heart dose with beam-to-heart distance and irradiated heart volume, cautions should be exercised to avoid long-term cardiac toxicity in the lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy."

Although we have defined the post-P2Y2R signaling mechanism in control of TF expression, the exact transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms remain to be determined. TF is a membrane-bound transmembrane glycoprotein that is normally not exposed to the blood circulation. It facilitates both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of coagulation and is a crucial protein in thrombotic diseases. In a normal blood vessel, TF is present mostly in tunica adventitia (fibroblasts), moderately in tunica media (smooth muscle cells), but virtually undetectable in endothelium (9Wilcox J.N. Smith K.M.

Some are endogenous molecules, such as TNF-α, interleukin-1β, CD40 ligand (10Steffel J. Lüscher T.F. Tanner F.C.

Among them, the MAPKs p38, p42/44 (ERK1/2), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and protein kinase C are commonly discussed as the positive regulatory pathways. In contrast, the PI3K/AKT pathway is shown to negatively regulate TF expression through an unknown mechanism (10Steffel J. Lüscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Tissue factor in cardiovascular diseases: molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.Circulation. 2006; 113: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar).

However, the transcriptional molecular mechanism in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation, i.e. P2Y2R, remains largely unknown. Increased TF expression and activity are characterized in unstable atherosclerotic plaques and correlated with a higher risk of atherothrombosis, which leads to myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke (17Moons A.H. Levi M. Peters R.J. Tissue factor and coronary artery disease.Cardiovasc. Res. 2002; 53: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Elevated levels of TF are also characterized in patients with other cardiovascular complications such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia (10Steffel J. Lüscher T.F. Tanner F.C. Tissue factor in cardiovascular diseases: molecular mechanisms and clinical implications.Circulation. 2006; 113: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). To understand how TF expression is up-regulated at the transcriptional level after P2Y2R activation, we have performed a bioinformatics search and found a new distal AP-1-binding site beyond the conventional ∼300-bp TF promoter region. Thus, the principal goal of this study was to determine whether this new AP-1 site is active in response to P2Y2R activation and, if so, to identify the exact AP-1 components controlled by P2Y2R signaling. Our findings demonstrate that in HCAEC, this new distal AP-1 site plays a significant role in P2Y2R-mediated TF transcription by recruiting c-Jun and a new positive regulator ATF-2. Furthermore, a negative regulator Fra-1 for the TF gene was also identified for the first time. HCAEC were cultured in EBM-2 medium supplemented with VEGF, FGF, EGF, IGF, ascorbic acid, GA 1000 (Lonza), and 5% FBS at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. HCAEC were used between the third and eighth passages. Before stimulation, cells were seeded to grow for 24 h and starved overnight. Where inhibitors were used, cells were pretreated with inhibitors for 1 h before stimulation. Total RNA and DNA were extracted from HCAEC using the RNeasy and DNeasy kits, respectively (Qiagen). On-column DNA digestion was carried out during RNA extraction. For the synthesis of the first strand of cDNA, 1 μg of total RNA after DNase (Ambion) treatment was reverse-transcribed using a cDNA synthesis kit (Applied Biosystems). The cDNA samples were then amplified by PCR using 2.5 units of TaqDNA polymerase (Qiagen). Real time PCR was performed on an iCycler iQ5 detection system (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen). The sequences of primers are as follows: TF mature mRNA: forward, 5′-ACGCTCCTGCTCGGCTGGGT-3′, and reverse, 5′-CGTCTGCTTCACATCCTTCA-3′; TF hnRNA (pre-mRNA): forward, 5′-CCCCTGGGTTGCTATGAGG-3′, reverse, 5′-CCTGGCTGTGGTGTTCTGTGC-3′; GAPDH: forward, 5′-TCAACAGCGACACCCACTCC-3′, and reverse, 5′-TGAGGTCCACCACCCTGTTG-3′. After stimulation, cells were lysed, and standard Western blotting was performed as described previously (18Ma W. Liu Y. Ellison N. Shen J.

The individual primary antibodies used were anti-p-c-Jun, anti-p-c-Fos, anti-p-ATF-2, anti-c-Jun, anti-Fra-1, anti-ATF-2 (Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-tissue factor (10H10, Calbiochem). Equal protein loading was verified by stripping off the original antibodies and re-probing the membranes with the primary antibody anti-GAPDH, anti-β-tubulin, or anti-β-actin (Cell Signaling Technology). Promoter constructs encompassing the region from −1427 to +207 relative to the transcription starting site of the human TF gene were amplified from human genomic DNA using specifically designed forward and reverse primers containing the EcoRV restriction enzyme site. The forward primer is 5′-GCTAGCCTCGAGGATATCCTACCTTCAATCCCAGAG-3′, and the reverse primer is AGGCCAGATCTTGATATCTCCATGTCTACCAGTTGGCG-3′. The promoter region was cloned into pGL4.12 vector (Promega) with In-Fusion HD EcoDry cloning kit (Clontech). Deleted, truncated, or mutated constructs were built with same method but with different primers as follows: deletion forward primer, 5′-CTCTTAGGGAAAAGGCTAGAGCCTGCATAAAAAGAG-3′, and deletion reverse primer, 5′-CCTTTTCCCTAAGAGATCTTCAGCTCCACCTGGGAT-3′; truncation forward primer, 5′-GCTAGCCTCGAGGATATCGGCTAGAGCCTGCATAAAAAG-3′, and truncation reverse primer is same as wild-type reverse primer; mutation forward primer, ′-GGAAAAGTCAGACGGC-TAGAGCCTGCATAAAAAGAG-3′, and mutation reverse primer, 5′-CCGTATGACTTTTCCCTAAGAGATCTTCAGCTCCAC-3′. HCAEC were seeded in 48-well plates and transiently transfected with various pGL4.12 vector constructs with Xfect Transfection Reagent (Clontech) following the manufacturer's instruction. Transfection efficiency was corrected by co-transfection with a plasmid containing the β-galactosidase gene driven by the SV40 promoter (Promega). β-Galactosidase activity was measured with β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured for reporter expression in triplicate according to the instructions provided in the Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed using the Agarose ChIP kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HCAEC were treated with or without UTP stimulation, after which cells were cross-linked in formaldehyde. Micrococcal nuclease was used to digest the chromatin. Approximately 10% of the resulting sample was kept to serve as an input genomic DNA control, and the rest was incubated with candidate antibody overnight with rotation, followed by 1 h of incubation with protein A-agarose beads for ChIP. The precipitated chromatin-protein complexes were washed and eluted, and the cross-links were reversed. The genomic DNA fragments were amplified by real time quantitative PCR. For the sequence containing the new AP-1 site, the primer sequences were as follows: forward, 5′-CTACCTTCAATCCCAGAG-3′, and reverse, 5′-CCTTGTAGACTTTCCTTCC-3′. DNA probe fragments were ordered from IDT and labeled with biotin at the 3′ end with the DNA 3′ end biotinylation kit (Pierce). Nuclear proteins were isolated from HCAEC with NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce). Each binding reaction contained 10 μg of nuclear extract proteins. To distinguish specific from nonspecific protein-DNA complex formation, incubations were also performed in the presence of 200-fold excess unlabeled probes. After incubation, the reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a pre-casted 6% TBE polyacrylamide gel (Lonza). The reactions were transferred to a nylon membrane and detected with LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce). The sequence of the human TF promoter −1363 AP-1 site is as follows: 5′-GGAAAATGACTCAGGCTAGA-3′. Antibodies against the individual AP-1 subunits (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C before adding biotin-labeled probe to the reaction. The binding reactions then follow the steps as described for EMSA. To confirm the specificity of the antibodies, two different amounts of antibodies were used, and corresponding IgG was used in place of antibodies as negative controls. HCAEC were starved overnight and treated with or without UTP for 30 min, lysed, and sonicated on ice. Cell lysate was pre-cleared and then incubated with 1 μg of rabbit anti-c-Jun antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose beads (Cell Signaling Technology) were added to the lysate/antibody mixture and incubated for another 2 h. The beads were then washed five times with cell lysis buffer and resuspended with 3× SDS sample buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C, loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by standard Western blotting. HCAEC were seeded in 8-chamber glass slides (Nunc), starved overnight, and then treated with or without UTP. After a 30-min treatment, the medium was aspirated, and cells were fixed for 15 min in cold methanol. The fixed cells were washed with PBS three times and blocked with 5% horse serum for 1 h at room temperature. Then the cells were incubated with rabbit monoclonal antibodies to human p-c-Jun, p-Fra-1, and p-ATF-2 (1:50) (Cell Signaling Technology) or rabbit polyclonal antibodies to human total c-Jun, Fra-1, and ATF-2 (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) for 90 min at room temperature in darkness. For negative controls, cells were incubated with non-immune rabbit IgG in place of the specific primary antibody or only the FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells were then washed with PBS three times and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555 phalloidin (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h. Finally, mounting medium containing DAPI was added to seal the slides. Images with fluorescent signals in random fields were acquired and captured using an AMG EVOS digital inverted multifunctional microscope. To knock down the three AP-1 subunits, c-Jun, Fra-1, and ATF-2, HCAEC were transfected with the four sequence pool (ON-TARGET plus Human SMARTpool L-003268-00-0005; L-004341-00-0005; L-009871-00-0005, Dharmacon) using DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent following the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, HCAEC were seeded in 6-well plates at 80–90% confluence; the medium was replaced with complete EBM-2 without antibiotics before transfection. DharmaFECT 4 and siRNA products were incubated separately in EBM-2 at room temperature for 5 min. Mixtures were combined, incubated another 20 min, and added to cells at a final concentration of 2 μl/ml DharmaFECT 4 and 25 nm siRNAs. Cells in the control group were treated with DharmaFECT 4 plus a scramble control siRNA. For UTP stimulation of the cells, siRNA and transfection reagent were removed 24 h post-transfection, and complete culture medium was added. After overnight starvation, cells were stimulated by UTP for 30 min or not. Western blotting was employed to verify knockdown efficiency 24 h post-transfection. Real time quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect TF pre-mRNA level after knockdown of the individual AP-1 subunits. DNA primers were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. EcoRV was purchased from Takara Bio Inc. Anti-c-Jun, anti-ATF-2, and anti-Fra1 antibodies used in ChIP assay were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. TNF-α was purchased from R&D Systems. Actinomycin D, U0126, Y-27632, SB203580, SP600125, 2-thio-UTP tetrasodium salt were purchased from Tocris Bioscience. PP2 was from EMD. Purified UTP was obtained from Sigma. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. The means of two groups were compared using Student's t test (unpaired, two tailed), and one-way analysis of variance was used for comparison of more than two groups with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. Unless otherwise indicated, all experiments were repeated at least three times. Because our previous study demonstrated that P2Y2R is the only UTP-sensitive nucleotide receptor expressed in HCAEC (11Ding L. Ma W. Littmann T. Camp R. Shen J. The P2Y(2) nucleotide receptor mediates tissue factor expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27027-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), UTP was routinely used to activate the P2Y2R throughout this study. Two pairs of primers were designed to selectively amplify non-spliced TF pre-mRNA (also termed hnRNA) and mature TF mRNA, respectively. The pair for mature mRNA spans from exon 1 to exon 3 with two introns in the middle. The amplicon length is 233 bp for the TF mature mRNA after splicing (Fig. 1A). The pair of primers for pre-mRNA is located in the same intron (intron 2), which will be spliced away before forming the mature mRNA. This pair of primers produces a 244-bp amplicon from the non-spliced pre-mRNA pool (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows that activation of HCAEC by TNF-α increased the TF expression levels of pre-mRNA and mature mRNA, which peaked at 30 min and 1 h, respectively. A similar pattern of time-dependent induction of both TF pre-mRNA and mature mRNA by UTP stimulation of the P2Y2R was observed (Fig. 1, C and D). To rule out possible DNA contamination in TF pre-mRNA amplification, we performed PCR using DNA samples with or without DNase treatment that we routinely used in total RNA isolation. Fig. 1E (lanes 2 and 3) shows that the PCR experiment using the DNA sample produced an expected band, but DNA sample treated with DNase generated no band, indicating the effectiveness of our protocol in DNA removal. Fig. 1E further shows that UTP stimulation significantly induced TF pre-mRNA expression (lane 6 versus lane 4), but omission of reverse transcriptase in our RT-PCR assay generated no amplicons (lane 7), suggesting no DNA contamination. These data indicate that TF pre-mRNA and mature mRNA are changed similarly over time by TNF-α and UTP stimulation and that HCAEC is an appropriate cell model for studying TF transcriptional mechanisms. A classic proximate TF promoter model (up to −227 bp) has been established through the years and is consistently used to study TF transcription (Fig. 2A) (21Li Y.D. Ye B.Q. Zheng S.X. Wang J.T. Wang J.G. Chen M. Liu J.G. Pei X.H. Wang L.J. Lin Z.X. Gupta K. Mackman N. Slungaard A. Key N.S. Geng J.G. NF-κB transcription factor p50 critically regulates tissue factor in deep vein thrombosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4473-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). There are binding sites for four transcription factors in this region as follows: AP-1, NF-κB, Egr-1, and Sp1. Sp1 is required for constitutive TF gene transcription, although the other three are responsible for inducible TF gene transcription (21Li Y.D. Ye B.Q. Zheng S.X. Wang J.T. Wang J.G. Chen M. Liu J.G. Pei X.H. Wang L.J. Lin Z.X. Gupta K. Mackman N. Slungaard A. Key N.S. Geng J.G. NF-κB transcription factor p50 critically regulates tissue factor in deep vein thrombosis.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 4473-4483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Although Egr-1 is an immediate early gene product, our previous study showed that de novo protein synthesis is not required for P2Y2R-mediated TF induction (11Ding L. Ma W. Littmann T. Camp R. Shen J. The P2Y(2) nucleotide receptor mediates tissue factor expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27027-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, our prior study also excluded the involvement of the NF-κB pathway (11Ding L. Ma W. Littmann T. Camp R. Shen J. The P2Y(2) nucleotide receptor mediates tissue factor expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 27027-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), leaving AP-1 as an attractive candidate. However, when we searched through TF promoter/enhancer region up to −5000 bp, we found another 100% consensus AP-1-binding site at −1363 bp (Fig. 2A). We also located the TF gene promoter in other mammalian species and found significant conservation of this new AP-1 site among them (Fig. 2B). To investigate this new AP-1-binding site, HCAEC were transfected with a luciferase construct and a plasmid containing β-galactosidase driven by the SV40 promoter to normalize the transfection efficiency. The TF promoter region up to −1427 bp containing the new AP-1 site or its deleted/truncated/mutated forms was cloned into a luciferase vector. 12 h after transfection, cells were starved overnight and then treated with 100 μm UTP for 4 h. Then luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined. Fig. 2C shows that UTP induced ∼8-fold of increase in luciferase activity over non-stimulated cells. Deletion, truncation, and mutation of this new AP-1 site all significantly decreased the promoter activity (Fig. 2C). In addition, treatment of HCAEC with the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D abolished UTP-induced TF promoter activity, suggesting transcription as the major mechanism (Fig. 2C). These data indicate that the new AP-1 site at −1363 bp has significant impact on TF gene transcription. An EMSA was conducted with the biotin-labeled AP-1 probe equivalent to the region −1369 to −1350 bp in the human TF promoter to confirm our luciferase activity assay. We found that nuclear extract from HCAEC has higher occupancy over this TF AP-1 site after UTP stimulation of the cells for 30 min. In addition, excessive unlabeled probes competed against labeled ones and eliminated the signal, indicating the specificity of the protein-DNA complex. Moreover, TNF-α stimulation for 30 min caused the same change as UTP, which suggests that the same site may also be taken up in TNF-α-induced TF induction (Fig. 3A). Quantitative data indicate that both UTP and TNF-α treatment increased probe occupancy about 4-fold (Fig. 3B). AP-1 components bind to the DNA promoter in a dimerized form (23Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor c-Fos-c-Jun bound to DNA.Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The two subunits come from members of the Jun protein family (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), Fos protein family (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), and some members of the activating transcription factor (ATF) subfamily (ATFa, ATF-2, and ATF-3) (23Glover J.N. Harrison S.C. Crystal structure of the heterodimeric bZIP transcription factor c-Fos-c-Jun bound to DNA.Nature. 1995; 373: 257-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). To determine the roles of different subunits, we first assessed the effect of P2Y2R activation on their phosphorylation status. Fig. 4, A–C and E–G, show that UTP or its analog 2-thio-UTP caused rapid phosphorylation of c-Jun, Fra-1, and ATF-2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. However, UTP failed to induce phosphorylation of c-Fos, one of the most classic AP-1 subunits in a timely fashion (Fig. 4D). JunB and JunD, in contrast, were not detectable (data not shown). It is known that the Jun protein is mainly in charge of binding affinity, whereas the others rely on dimerizing with a Jun protein to influence the promoter activity (24Hess J. Angel P.

https://openalex.org/W2193963360,"Synaptic abnormalities are prominent in prion disease pathogenesis and are responsible for functional deficits. The microtubule associated protein, Tau, binds to and stabilizes microtubules in axons ensuring axonal transport of synaptic components. Tau phosphorylation reduces its affinity for microtubules leading to their instability and resulting in disrupted axonal transport and synaptic dysfunction. We report on the levels of total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau), measured by highly sensitive laser-based immunoassays, in the central nervous system and biofluids from experimentally transmitted prion disease in mice and natural cases of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (sCJD) in humans. We found that, in contrast to sCJD where only the levels of T-Tau in brain are increased, both T-Tau and P-Tau are increased in the brains of symptomatic mice experimentally infected with the ME7, 139A and 22L mouse-adapted scrapie strains. The increased levels of T-Tau in sCJD brain, compared to control samples, were also observed in patient plasma. In contrast, there was no detectable increase in T-Tau and P-Tau in plasma from symptomatic experimentally infected mice. Furthermore, our data suggests that in mice showing clinical signs of prion disease the levels and/or ratios of T-Tau and P-Tau are only a useful parameter for differentiating the mouse-adapted scrapie strains that differ in the extent of disease. We conclude that the neuropathogenesis associated with P-Tau and synaptic dysfunction is similar for at least two of the mouse-adapted scrapie strains tested but may differ between sporadic and experimentally transmitted prion diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2186225951,"The clinical expression of type 1 von Willebrand disease may be modified by co-inheritance of other mild bleeding diatheses. We previously showed that mutations in the platelet P2Y12 ADP receptor gene (P2RY12) could contribute to the bleeding phenotype in patients with type 1 von Willebrand disease. Here we investigated whether variations in platelet G protein-coupled receptor genes other than P2RY12 also contributed to the bleeding phenotype. Platelet G protein-coupled receptor genes P2RY1, F2R, F2RL3, TBXA2R and PTGIR were sequenced in 146 index cases with type 1 von Willebrand disease and the potential effects of identified single nucleotide variations were assessed using in silico methods and heterologous expression analysis. Seven heterozygous single nucleotide variations were identified in 8 index cases. Two single nucleotide variations were detected in F2R; a novel c.-67G>C transversion which reduced F2R transcriptional activity and a rare c.1063C>T transition predicting a p.L355F substitution which did not interfere with PAR1 expression or signalling. Two synonymous single nucleotide variations were identified in F2RL3 (c.402C>G, p.A134 =; c.1029 G>C p.V343 =), both of which introduced less commonly used codons and were predicted to be deleterious, though neither of them affected PAR4 receptor expression. A third single nucleotide variation in F2RL3 (c.65 C>A; p.T22N) was co-inherited with a synonymous single nucleotide variation in TBXA2R (c.6680 C>T, p.S218 =). Expression and signalling of the p.T22N PAR4 variant was similar to wild-type, while the TBXA2R variation introduced a cryptic splice site that was predicted to cause premature termination of protein translation. The enrichment of single nucleotide variations in G protein-coupled receptor genes among type 1 von Willebrand disease patients supports the view of type 1 von Willebrand disease as a polygenic disorder."

Consistent with higher basal expression, leukocytes rolled more slowly on P-selectin in trauma-stimulated venules of SelpKI/KI mice. However, TNF-α did not further reduce P-selectin-dependent rolling velocities. Blunted up-regulation of P-selectin mRNA during contact hypersensitivity reduced P-selectin-dependent inflammation in SelpKI/− mice.

https://openalex.org/W2253723186,"The purpose of this study is to clarify the effects of chronic powder diet feeding on sleep patterns and other physiological/anatomical changes in mice. C57BL/6 male mice were divided into two groups from weaning: a group fed with solid food (SD) and a group fed with powder food (PD), and sleep and physiological and anatomical changes were compared between the groups. PD exhibited less cranial bone structure development and a significant weight gain. Furthermore, these PD mice showed reduced number of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Sleep analysis showed that PD induced attenuated diurnal sleep/wake rhythm, characterized by increased sleep during active period and decreased sleep during rest period. With food deprivation (FD), PD showed less enhancement of wake/locomotor activity compared to SD, indicating reduced food-seeking behavior during FD. These results suggest that powder feeding in mice results in a cluster of detrimental symptoms caused by abnormal energy metabolism and anatomical/neurological changes."

This study seeks to explore heart performance and cardiac remodeling likely to define cardiac parameters which influence specific performance in male handball players across different age ranges. Forty three players, with a regular training and competitive background in handball separated into three groups aged on average 11.78 ± 0.41 for youth players aka ""schools"", ""elite juniors"" 15.99 ± 0.81 and ""elite adults"" 24.46 ± 2.63 years, underwent echocardiography and ECG examinations. Incremental ergocycle and specific field (SFT) tests have also been conducted. With age and regular training and competition, myocardial remodeling in different age ranges exhibit significant differences in dilatation's parameters between ""schools"" and ""juniors"" players, such as the end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and the end-systolic diameter of the left ventricle (LVESD), the root of aorta (Ao) and left atrial (LA), while significant increase is observed between ""juniors"" and ""adults"" players in the interventricular septum (IVS), the posterior wall thicknesses (PWT) and LV mass index. ECG changes are also noted but NS differences were observed in studied parameters. For incremental maximal test, players demonstrate a significant increase in duration and total work between ""schools"" and ""juniors"" and, in total work only, between ""juniors"" and ""seniors"". The SFT shows improvement in performance which ranged between 26.17 ± 1.83 sec to 31.23 ± 2.34 sec respectively from ""seniors"" to ""schools"". The cross-sectional approach used to compare groups with prior hypothesis that there would be differences in exercise performance and cardiac parameters depending on duration of prior handball practice, leads to point out the early cardiac remodeling within the heart as adaptive change. Prevalence of cardiac chamber dilation with less hypertrophy remodeling was found from ""schools"" to ""juniors"" while a prevalence of cardiac hypertrophy with less pronounced chamber dilation remodeling was noted later."
https://openalex.org/W2183397565,"Introduction Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDK), conserved across bacteria to humans, synthesises NTP from NDP and ATP. The eukaryotic homologue, the NDPK, uses ATP to phosphorylate the tubulin-bound GDP to GTP for tubulin polymerisation. The bacterial cytokinetic protein FtsZ, which is the tubulin homologue, also uses GTP for polymerisation. Therefore, we examined whether NDK can interact with FtsZ to convert FtsZ-bound GDP and/or free GDP to GTP to trigger FtsZ polymerisation. Methods Recombinant and native NDK and FtsZ proteins of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis were used as the experimental samples. FtsZ polymersation was monitored using 90° light scattering and FtsZ polymer pelleting assays. The γ32P-GTP synthesised by NDK from GDP and γ32P-ATP was detected using thin layer chromatography and quantitated using phosphorimager. The FtsZ bound 32P-GTP was quantitated using phosphorimager, after UV-crosslinking, followed by SDS-PAGE. The NDK-FtsZ interaction was determined using Ni2+-NTA-pulldown assay and co-immunoprecipitation of the recombinant and native proteins in vitro and ex vivo, respectively. Results NDK triggered instantaneous polymerisation of GDP-precharged recombinant FtsZ in the presence of ATP, similar to the polymerisation of recombinant FtsZ (not GDP-precharged) upon the direct addition of GTP. Similarly, NDK triggered polymerisation of recombinant FtsZ (not GDP-precharged) in the presence of free GDP and ATP as well. Mutant NDK, partially deficient in GTP synthesis from ATP and GDP, triggered low level of polymerisation of MsFtsZ, but not of MtFtsZ. As characteristic of NDK’s NTP substrate non-specificity, it used CTP, TTP, and UTP also to convert GDP to GTP, to trigger FtsZ polymerisation. The NDK of one mycobacterial species could trigger the polymerisation of the FtsZ of another mycobacterial species. Both the recombinant and the native NDK and FtsZ showed interaction with each other in vitro and ex vivo, alluding to the possibility of direct phosphorylation of FtsZ-bound GDP by NDK. Conclusion Irrespective of the bacterial species, NDK interacts with FtsZ in vitro and ex vivo and, through the synthesis of GTP from FtsZ-bound GDP and/or free GDP, and ATP (CTP/TTP/UTP), triggers FtsZ polymerisation. The possible biological context of this novel activity of NDK is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2187628853,Scientists now have several tools to edit the genomes of living organisms. One of the most recent is revolutionizing research and has thrust two of its creators into the limelight.

https://openalex.org/W2184380227,"Genome editing uses enzymes that are targeted to sequences of DNA to make cuts. These cuts are then repaired by the cell's machinery. This technology allows scientists to disrupt or modify genes with unprecedented precision. By Amy Maxmen, infographic by Denis Mallet."
https://openalex.org/W2195423926,"Many advances in synthetic biology require the removal of a large number of genomic elements from a genome. Most existing deletion methods leave behind markers, and as there are a limited number of markers, such methods can only be applied a fixed number of times. Deletion methods that recycle markers generally are either imprecise (remove untargeted sequences), or leave scar sequences which can cause genome instability and rearrangements. No existing marker recycling method is automation-friendly. We have developed a novel openly available deletion tool that consists of: 1) a method for deleting genomic elements that can be repeatedly used without limit, is precise, scar-free, and suitable for automation; and 2) software to design the method's primers. Our tool is sequence agnostic and could be used to delete large numbers of coding sequences, promoter regions, transcription factor binding sites, terminators, etc in a single genome. We have validated our tool on the deletion of non-essential open reading frames (ORFs) from S. cerevisiae. The tool is applicable to arbitrary genomes, and we provide primer sequences for the deletion of: 90% of the ORFs from the S. cerevisiae genome, 88% of the ORFs from S. pombe genome, and 85% of the ORFs from the L. lactis genome."
