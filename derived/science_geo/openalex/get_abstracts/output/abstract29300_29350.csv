https://openalex.org/W1636221253,"A novel cytokine, interleukin-8 (IL-8), may play major roles in the inflammatory process by recruiting neutrophils and T cells into inflammatory sites. The production of this cytokine is not constitutive and is induced in a variety of cell types by stimulation with mitogens and cytokines. Among cytokines, only IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can induce IL-8 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Transfection of a human fibrosarcoma cell line with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression plasmids linked to a 5'-flanking deletion mutants of the IL-8 gene demonstrated that the nucleotides between -94 and -71 base pairs from the start of the first exon are essential and sufficient for the IL-8 induction by either IL-1, TNF, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This sequence is composed of two cis-elements; one is the potential binding site for a nuclear factor-kappa B-like factor and the other for a cis-regulatory enhancer binding protein-like factor. Mutations in either elements abolished IL-1, TNF, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate responsiveness. This report provides the first evidence that cooperation between two distinct cis-elements may be required for induction of gene expression by either IL-1 or TNF."
https://openalex.org/W2067694850,CD4 glycoprotein on the surface of T cells helps in the immune response and is the receptor for HIV infection. The structure of a soluble fragment of CD4 determined at 2.3 A resolution reveals that the molecule has two intimately associated immunoglobulin-like domains. Residues implicated in HIV recognition by analysis of mutants and antibody binding are salient features in domain D1. Domain D2 is distinguished by a variation on the beta-strand topologies of antibody domains and by an intra-sheet disulphide bridge.

https://openalex.org/W1563095952,"Steroid 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) is absent or defective in more than 90% of patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This disorder of cortisol biosynthesis occurs in a wide spectrum of clinical severity; specific mutations in the 21-hydroxylase gene (CYP21) have been found in association with particular clinical phenotypes. To determine the functional effects of mutations causing amino acid substitutions, normal P450c21 and three mutagenized P450c21 enzymes were expressed at high levels in cultured COS-1 cells using recombinant vaccinia virus. A single amino acid substitution (Val281----Leu) present in patients with mild nonclassical 21-hydroxylase deficiency resulted in an enzyme with 20-50% of normal activity. A mutation (Ile172----Asn) identified in patients with the simple virilizing form (poor cortisol synthesis but adequate aldosterone synthesis) resulted in an enzyme with less than 2% of normal activity. Finally, a cluster mutation (Ile-Val-Glu-Met234-238----Asn-Glu-Glu-Lys) found in a patient with severe salt wasting 21-hydroxylase deficiency (inadequate aldosterone synthesis) results in an enzyme with no detectable activity. These data indicate that the severity of 21-hydroxylase deficiency correlates with the degree of enzymatic compromise."
https://openalex.org/W1503934385,"Time courses for NO, O2, CO, methyl and ethyl isocyanide rebinding to native and mutant sperm whale myoglobins were measured at 20 degrees C following 17-ns and 35-ps laser excitation pulses. His64 (E7) was replaced with Gly, Val, Leu, Phe, and Gln, and Val68 (E11) was replaced with Ala, Ile, and Phe. For both NO and O2, the effective picosecond quantum yield of unliganded geminate intermediates was roughly 0.2 and independent of the amino acids at positions 64 and 68. Geminate recombination of NO was very rapid; 90% rebinding occurred within 0.5-1.0 ns for all of the myoglobins examined; and except for the Gly64 and Ile68 mutants, the fitted recombination rate parameters were little influenced by the size and polarity of the amino acid at position 64 and the size of the residue at position 68. The rates of NO recombination and ligand movement away from the iron atom in the Gly64 mutant increased 3-4-fold relative to native myoglobin. For Ile68 myoglobin, the first geminate rate constant for NO rebinding decreased approximately 6-fold, from 2.3 x 10(10) s-1 for native myoglobin to 3.8 x 10(9) s-1 for the mutant. No picosecond rebinding processes were observed for O2, CO, and isocyanide rebinding to native and mutant myoglobins; all of the observed geminate rate constants were less than or equal to 3 x 10(8) s-1. The rebinding time courses for these ligands were analyzed in terms of a two-step consecutive reaction scheme, with an outer kinetic barrier representing ligand movement into and out of the protein and an inner barrier representing binding to the heme iron atom by ligand occupying the distal portion of the heme pocket. Substitution of apolar amino acids for His64 decreased the absolute free energies of the outer and inner kinetic barriers and the well for non-covalently bound O2 and CO by 1 to 1.5 kcal/mol, regardless of size. In contrast, the His64 to Gln mutation caused little change in the barrier heights for all ligands, showing that the polar nature of His64 inhibits both the bimolecular rate of ligand entry into myoglobin and the unimolecular rate of binding to the iron atom from within the protein. Increasing the size of the position 68(E11) residue in the series Ala to Val (native) to Ile caused little change in the rate of O2 migration into myoglobin or the equilibrium constant for noncovalent binding but did decrease the unimolecular rate for iron-O2 bond formation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1580206398,"The cardiac m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is a sialoglycosylated transmembrane protein which has three potential sites for N-glycosylation (namely, Asn2, Asn3, and Asn6). To investigate the role of N-linked oligosaccharide(s) in the expression and function of the receptor, we constructed glycosylation-defective mutant receptor genes in which the three asparagine codons were substituted by codons for either aspartate (Asp2,3,6), lysine (Lys2,3,6), or glutamine (Gln2,3,6). The glycosylation-defective and wild-type receptor genes were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Binding experiments with the membrane-permeable radioligand [3H]quinuclidinyl-benzilate and the membrane-impermeable radioligand [3H]N-methylscopolamine revealed that the Asp2,3,6, Gln2,3,6, and wild-type receptors were located exclusively on the cell surface and expressed in similar numbers. The Lys2,3,6 mutant receptor was expressed at a relatively low level and was therefore not included in subsequent experiments. Wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that the wild-type receptor, but not the Asp2,3,6 and Gln2,3,6 mutant receptors were N-glycosylated. The Asp2,3,6 and Gln2,3,6 mutant receptors had the same affinities for mAChR ligands as wild-type receptors. The time courses for degradation of the Asp2,3,6, Gln2,3,6, and wild-type receptors were also similar. In vivo functional analysis of the ability of the glycosylation mutant receptors to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation revealed that maximal inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity was similar in the mutant and wild-type receptors. The Asp2,3,6 mutant receptor had an unaltered IC50 value for carbachol while the IC50 value of the Gln2,3,6 mutant receptor was 2-fold higher than that of the wild-type receptor. These results indicate that N-glycosylation of the m2 mAChR is not required for cell surface localization or ligand binding and does not confer increased stability against receptor degradation. Furthermore, N-glycosylation of the m2 mAChR is not required for functional coupling of the m2 mAChR to inhibition of adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W4793426,"N-Acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase (NAALA dipeptidase) is a membrane-bound metallopeptidase that cleaves glutamate from the endogenous neuropeptide N-acetyl-L-aspartyl-L-glutamate. In this report, we have solubilized NAALA dipeptidase activity from synaptosomal membranes with Triton X-100 and purified it to apparent homogeneity by sequential column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, CM-Sepharose, and lentil lectin-Sepharose. This procedure resulted in a 720-fold purification with 1.6% yield. The purified ezyme migrated as a single silver-stained band on a sodium dodecyl sulfate gel with an apparent molecular weight of 94 kDa. Using an enzymatic stain to visualize NAALA dipeptidase activity within a gel matrix, we have confirmed that the 94-kDa band is, indeed, NAALA dipeptidase. The purified enzyme was characterized and found to be pharmacologically similar to NAALA dipeptidase activity described previously in synaptosomal membrane extracts. Using the purified NAALA dipeptidase as antigen, we have raised specific and high titer polyclonal antibodies in guinea pig. Immunocytochemical studies show intense NAALA dipeptidase immunoreactivity in the cerebellar and renal cortices."
https://openalex.org/W1512264218,"We have isolated from B16 mouse melanoma cells a complementary DNA (Mel-18), whose deduced amino acid sequence possesses a characteristic zinc finger structure. Immunostaining with antibodies raised against partial Mel-18 peptide sequences demonstrated nuclear localization of the gene product. We have also demonstrated that this protein has DNA-binding capacity, and the zinc finger is responsible for the DNA binding. At the transcriptional level the Mel-18 mRNA was detected in all tumor cells examined as well as melanoma cells (ontogenically of neural origin) but was scarcely present in normal tissues except neural organs. The transcript is developmentally regulated. These data suggest that Mel-18 may play a role in transcriptional regulation and also in control of cell proliferation and/or neural cell development."
https://openalex.org/W2067110717,"Little is currently known about the mechanisms by which the cellular glycosylation machinery is regulated to produce cell type-specific glycosylation sequences on glycoprotein and glycolipid sugar chains. Previously, we have shown that one enzyme involved in terminal glycosylation, beta-galactoside alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase, is expressed in a tissue-specific fashion, with the highest enzyme activity as well as mRNA levels being found in the liver. In addition, the liver mRNA was found to be 4.3 kilobases (kb) in size as compared to a larger message of 4.7 kb in other tissues. To understand the cellular regulation of expression of this sialyltransferase, we have cloned the rat gene encoding the 4.3-kb liver mRNA and found that it spans 40 kb of genomic DNA and contains 6 exons. The gene was found to be very similar in size and exon organization to the murine beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase gene, even though this enzyme has no sequence homology to alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase. The promoter responsible for the production of the liver alpha 2,6-sialyltransferase mRNA is approximately 50-fold more active in a hepatoma cell line known to express this enzyme (HepG2) than in a cell line shown not to express this enzyme (Chinese hamster ovary) and contains consensus binding sites for the liver restricted transcription factors HNF-1 and DBP as well as the transcription factors AP-1 and AP-2. These observations are in accord with the restricted expression of the 4.3-kb mRNA, and provides evidence for the cellular regulation of glycosylation at the level of transcription."

https://openalex.org/W61532108,"The thyrotropin (TSH) receptor belongs to a family of guanine nucleotide protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane-spanning regions joined regulatory together by extracellular and intracellular loops. The cytoplasmic domain comprises three cytoplasmic loops and a cytoplasmic tail that are likely to be important in coupling of the receptor to the guanine nucleotide proteins. To address the question of which portions of the cytoplasmic domain of the TSH receptor are important in this process, we have altered groups of amino acids in the region of the TSH receptor by site-directed mutagenesis. Because of the low affinity of TSH binding to the TSH receptor mutated in the amino terminus of the second cytoplasmic loop and the amino terminus of the cytoplasmic tail, definitive conclusions cannot be made regarding the roles of these regions in signal transduction. However, our data indicate that the first cytoplasmic loop (residues 441-450), the carboxyl-terminal region of the second cytoplasmic loop (residues 528-537), and the carboxyl-terminal (but not the amino-terminal) region of the third cytoplasmic loop (residues 617-625) are important in the ability of the TSH receptor to mediate an increase in intracellular cAMP production. Furthermore, two-thirds of the carboxyl-terminal end of the cytoplasmic tail (residues 709-764; corresponding to the region not conserved between the TSH and lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin receptors) can be removed without functional impairment of the TSH receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1488743900,"Maltose transport in Escherichia coli is regulated at the protein level by the glucose-specific enzyme III (IIIglc) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, by a mechanism known as inducer exclusion. We have isolated and characterized four mutants in the maltose transport system, all of which are in malK, which are resistant to inducer exclusion. The mutations in three of these mutants fall within the COOH-terminal domain of MalK and suggest the first reported function for this domain. Two of these are in a region which shows sequence similarity to lacY and melB, both of which are also regulated by IIIglc, and thus may define a IIIglc-binding domain. We have also reconstituted inducer exclusion in proteoliposomes made from membranes overexpressing the maltose permease. Maltose transport is inhibited by 50-60% when IIIglc is included in the intravesicular space. The inhibition is due to a decrease in the Vmax of transport by a factor of 2. IIIglc does not affect the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to maltose transport, since the ratio of ATP hydrolyzed/maltose transported remained constant in the presence and absence of IIIglc. Finally, the Ki for IIIglc was 40 microM, roughly the same as the in vivo concentration of IIIglc."
https://openalex.org/W1576291976,"We have subdivided the components of the basic RNA polymerase II machinery from Drosophila embryos into three fractions and RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II was 90% homogeneous and possessed the IIa form of the largest subunit. By substitution of these factors with their mammalian homologues in reconstituted transcription reactions, we have determined that the three Drosophila fractions contain transcription factor (TF)IIB, TFIIE/F, and TFIID. In addition, the fraction with TFIID contains another essential activity, which we have tentatively designated as TFIIZ. There was no apparent requirement for TFIIA. The reconstituted transcription factors accurately transcribe both Drosophila and mammalian genes. This fractionated system should serve as a source of general transcription factors for the study of RNA polymerase II transcription in Drosophila as well as other eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W136318563,"Two different mannose-binding proteins (MBP-A and MBP-C), which show 56% sequence identity, are present in rat serum and liver. It has previously been shown that MBP-A binds to a range of monosaccharide-bovine serum albumin conjugates, and that, among oligosaccharide ligands tested, preferential binding is to terminal nonreducing N-acetylglucosamine residues of complex type N-linked oligosaccharides. In order to compare the binding specificity of MBP-C, an expression system has been developed for production of a fragment of this protein which contains the COOH-terminal carbohydrate-recognition domain. After radioiodination, the domain has been used to probe natural glycoproteins, neoglycoproteins, and neoglycolipids. Like MBP-A, MBP-C binds several different monosaccharides conjugated to bovine serum albumin, including mannose, fucose, and N-acetylglucosamine, although binding to the last of these is relatively weaker than observed for MBP-A. The results of binding to natural glycoproteins and to neoglycolipids containing oligosaccharides derived from these proteins are most compatible with the interpretation that MBP-C interacts primarily with the trimannosyl core of complex N-linked oligosaccharides, with additional ligands being terminal fucose and perhaps also peripheral mannose residues of high mannose type oligosaccharides. This binding specificity is thus quite distinct from that of MBP-A. The presence of multiple MBPs with distinct binding specificities in preparations derived from serum and liver explains conflicting conclusions which have been reached about carbohydrate recognition by these proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1502544270,"Abstract Escherichia coli KK313, which was deficient in spermidine transport, was isolated by treatment of E. coli MA261 with N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. E. coli NH1596, which was deficient in spermidine transport and has a 90% decreased putrescine transport activity, was obtained by a second treatment of E. coli KK313 with the same mutagen. Genes for polyamine transport systems were isolated by transforming E. coli NH1596 through DNA fragments from E. coli DR112 using pACYC184 as a vector. One clone for the gene of protein(s) catalyzing both putrescine and spermidine uptake (pPT104) was isolated. Two clones for the genes of protein(s) catalyzing only putrescine uptake (pPT79 and pPT71) were obtained. The genes encoded by pPT104, pPT79, and pPT71 were mapped at 15, 19, and 16 min of E. coli chromosome, respectively. Spermidine uptake by NH1596 carrying pPT104, and by MA261, was not inhibited by putrescine and several polyamine analogues, and the Kt values of these two systems were both approximately 0.1 microM. Putrescine transport by NH1596 carrying pPT104 was inhibited completely by spermidine, N,N-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridylium (paraquat), and N1-acetyl-spermidine, and the Kt value was 1.4 microM. Putrescine uptake by NH1596 carrying pPT79 or pPT71 was not inhibited by spermidine and several polyamine analogues, and the Kt values were 0.5 and 1.8 microM, respectively. In MA261, the putrescine uptake was inhibited by 25-35% by paraquat and N1-acetyl-polyamines and showed two Kt values, 0.5 and 1.5 microM. Based on these findings, the polyamine transport systems of E. coli are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1537644103,"The lepidopteran-specific, insecticidal crystal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis vary in toxicity to different species of lepidopteran larvae. We report studies of CryIA(a) and CryIA(c), two related proteins that have different degrees of toxicity to Heliothis virescens yet very similar degrees of toxicity to Manduca sexta. The amino acid differences between these proteins are located primarily between residues 280 and 722. We have constructed a series of chimeric proteins and determined their toxicities to both insects. The most significant findings arise from the replacement of three segments of the cryIA(c) gene with homologous portions of the cryIA(a) gene: codons 332-428, 429-447, and 448-722. Each of these segments contributed substantially and largely additively toward efficacy for H. virescens. However, replacement of the 429-447 segment of cryIA(c) gene with the cryIA(a) sequence resulted in a 27-50-fold reduction in toxicity toward M. sexta whereas the reduction in toxicity to H. virescens was only 3-4-fold. Subdivision of the 429-447 segment and replacements involving residues within this segment reduced toxicity to M. sexta by 5- to more than 2000-fold whereas toxicity to H. virescens was only reduced 3-10-fold. These observations indicate that: 1) different but overlapping regions of the cryIA(c) gene determine specificity to each of the two test insects; 2) some of the examined gene segments interact in determining specificity; and 3) different sequences in the cryIA(a) and cryIA(c) genes are required for maximal toxicity to M. sexta."

https://openalex.org/W1506007337,"The constitutive secretory pathway has been reconstituted in mechanically permeabilized Chinese hamster ovary cells using two secretory markers, an acyltripeptide (N-octanoyl-Asn-Tyr-Thr-NH2) that is glycosylated at Asn in the endoplasmic reticulum and a truncated ceramide that is converted to sphingomyelin. Secretion of these bulk phase markers is dependent on cytosolic proteins and ATP. Secretion of both the glycosylated tripeptide and truncated sphingomyelin was inhibited at 15 degrees C. These results are taken as evidence that the vesicle flow to the plasma membrane (rather than artificial lysis of endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi cisternae) is required for the release of markers to the medium. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), a nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP, inhibited secretion, resulting in an accumulation of both the glycosylated tripeptide and truncated sphingomyelin in the semi-intact cell. Inhibition of secretion by GTP gamma S was not observed in the presence of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin."
https://openalex.org/W1498244267,"S-Antigen (S-Ag) is a major soluble photoreceptor protein involved in the visual transduction cascade. Several S-Ag cDNAs and a gene coding for human S-Ag were isolated from cDNA and gene libraries. The gene sequences of the coding, noncoding, and 5'-flanking regions of the gene were determined. The S-Ag gene was approximately 50 kbp (kilobase pairs) in length and contained 16 exons and 15 introns. The length of most exons was less than 100 base pairs (bp) and the smallest one was only 10 bp. In contrast, the length of most introns was larger than 2 kbp, and the gene comprised 97% intron and 3% exon. The splice sites for donor and acceptor were in good agreement with the GT/AG rule. The S-Ag protein of 403 amino acid residues was translated from a mRNA of 1.9 kbp, and the mRNA was transcribed from a gene of 50 kbp. The 5'-flanking region of the gene, approximately 1.1 kbp long, had no known regulatory elements for transcription such as TATA, GC, and CCAAT boxes. Interestingly, the 5'-flanking region had promoter activity in an in vitro transcription assay using a nuclear extract of rat brain. A major transcription start site was found at 387 bp upstream from the translation start site ATG. Our results indicate that the sequence of S-Ag promoter differs from other known promoters and may, perhaps, be specific for photoreceptor rod cells and pinealocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1505355353,"Abstract The involvement of the ethanolamine-linked phosphoglyceride fraction (PE) in neutrophil signal transduction is suggested by the stimulus-induced release of arachidonic acid from PE (Chilton, F. H., and Connell, T. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 5260-5265) and by the synthesis of acetylated PE species, predominantly 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (alkenylacetyl-GPE; Tessner, T. G., and Wykle, R. L. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 12660-12664) in stimulated cells. In the studies reported here, we investigated the relationship between arachidonic acid release from PE and generation of the lysophospholipid precursor required in the biosynthesis of alkenylacetyl-GPE. In order to follow these reactions, we prelabeled neutrophils with 1-O-[3H]alk-1'-enyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (alkenyl-acyl-GPE). We also followed the hydrolysis of endogenous PE by analysis as the dinitrophenyl derivative using a high pressure liquid chromatography method we developed. Our results coupled with those of Chilton et al. (Chilton, F. H., Ellis, J. M., Olson, S. C., and Wykle, R. L. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12014-12019) indicate that in human neutrophils the metabolism of alkenylacyl-GPE and alkylacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (GPC) are strikingly similar with regard to arachidonate metabolism. When added to neutrophils, both 1-O-[3H]alkenyl-2-lyso-GPE and 1-O-[3H]alkyl-2-lyso-GPC are acylated predominantly with arachidonic acid, and the resulting arachidonoyl-containing phospholipids are extensively deacylated upon stimulation. However, hydrolysis of PE in the neutrophil differs from hydrolysis of choline-containing phosphoglycerides in that stimulation leads to a greater accumulation of the ethanolamine-linked lysophospholipid. A comparison of the molecular species of endogenous PE (based on molar concentrations measured as the dinitrophenyl derivative) from resting and stimulated neutrophils indicated that only those species which contain arachidonate are significantly hydrolyzed."
https://openalex.org/W1575291807,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the ribosomal RNA genes are present in a single tandem array. A transcriptional enhancer element lies within the spacer region between each rRNA gene, 2.2 kilobases upstream from the transcription initiation site. We have identified previously two proteins, REB1 and REB2, that bind to specific sites within the enhancer (Morrow, B. E., Johnson, S. P., and Warner, J. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 9061-9068). REB1 binds also to a second, higher affinity site near the promoter, 210 base pairs upstream from the initiation site. This report describes the purification and further characterization of REB1. REB1 is a single polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 125,000 Da that binds to the sequence CCGGGTAA. It has been found to bind also within transcriptional control regions of several genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, such as the UASG of the GAL1-GAL10 spacer. Immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that REB1 is phosphorylated."

https://openalex.org/W1549916910,"ADP is an important regulator of hepatic metabolism. Despite its importance the level of free ADP in the liver remains controversial. Recently, we engineered transgenic mice which express high levels of creatine kinase in liver. The reaction catalyzed by creatine kinase was assumed to be at equilibrium and used to calculate a free ADP level of 0.059 mumol/g wet weight. In this report we test the equilibrium assumption by studying the free ADP level as a function of enzyme activity or substrate content. Over a 5-fold range of creatine kinase activity, from 150-800 mumol/min/g wet weight, there was no change in the free ADP level. The average value of ADP for these mice was 0.061 +/- 0.016 mumol/g wet weight. Similarly, altering hepatic creatine content from 1.6 to 30 mumol/g wet weight had no effect on the calculated total free ADP level. The average value of ADP for the creatine levels was 0.048 +/- 0.015 mumol/g wet weight. Finally, the free ADP level was calculated using the equilibrium with cyclocreatine rather than creatine as substrate. The equilibrium of the reaction with cyclocreatine lies 30 times more toward phosphorylation than does the equilibrium with creatine. A free ADP level of 0.063 +/- 0.031 mumol/g wet weight was calculated using cyclocreatine. This value is not different from that found with creatine. These results show that the equilibrium assumption used to calculate free ADP levels in transgenic mouse liver is valid, and the presence of creatine kinase does not affect ADP levels."
https://openalex.org/W52918786,"Effects of the tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), on expression of pulmonary surfactant proteins, SP-A and SP-B, were determined in a human pulmonary adenocarcinoma cell line (H441-4). TPA decreased cellular SP-A content in association with decreased de novo synthesis of SP-A as assessed by [35S]methionine incorporation. Effects of TPA were time (0-72 h) and dose (IC50 0.5-1.0 nM)-dependent. Phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), and 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol also decreased SP-A content in these cells. Characteristics of inhibition of SP-A content by PDBu were similar to those of [3H]PDBu binding to H441-4 cells. Inhibitory effects of TPA on SP-A synthesis were associated with concomitant decreases in SP-A mRNA. Expression of a distinct surfactant protein, SP-B, was also markedly decreased after exposure to TPA. SP-A and SP-B mRNA contents decreased more rapidly after treatment with TPA than after actinomycin D. Actinomycin D completely blocked the rapid decrease in SP-A and SP-B mRNAs caused by the phorbol ester, consistent with the concept that the inhibitory effect of TPA on the surfactant protein mRNAs required continued gene transcription and was not mediated solely by changes in SP-A or SP-B transcription. Inhibitory effects of phorbol esters on SP-A and SP-B synthesis support the concept that protein kinase C modulates surfactant protein expression in this cell."

The nuclear, chloroplast ribosome-deficient mutant of C. reinhardtii, ac20, overaccumulates a approximately 3.6-kilobase unspliced 23 S preRNA compared to wild-type cells. We have used [alpha-32P]GTP labeling of total RNA preparations from ac20 to rapidly determine that 23 S preRNA is capable of self-splicing. The ability of the 23 S intron (with flanking exon sequences) to correctly catalyze its own splicing was confirmed using RNA produced by in vitro transcription of cloned DNA. These results identify the first example of a self-splicing RNA of chloroplast origin."
https://openalex.org/W1490031381,"The mitochondrial protein synthesis translocase elongation factor Gmt (EF-Gmt) from bovine liver has been purified to greater than 90% homogeneity by a combination of conventional gravity and high performance liquid chromatography. The purification scheme results in an approximate overall 14,000-fold purification with 2% total recovery of EF-Gmt activity. Gel filtration chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicate that the mitochondrial factor is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 80,000. EF-Gmt displays similar levels of activity on its homologous mitochondrial ribosomes and on Escherichia coli ribosomes. The mitochondrial translocase is sensitive to temperatures above 37 degrees C, but the factor is partially protected from heat inactivation in the presence of GTP or GDP. The activity of EF-Gmt is inhibited by treatment of the factor with N-ethylmaleimide. In contrast to all other translocases tested to date, EF-Gmt is completely resistant to the inhibiting effect of fusidic acid when tested on its homologous ribosomes. It displays weak sensitivity to this antibiotic when assayed in the presence of heterologous E. coli ribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1492235426,"IgE-binding protein (epsilon BP) is a protein which has affinity for IgE and was originally identified in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells. Subsequently, it was found to be the rat homolog of CBP35, a murine beta-galactoside-specific lectin. This protein is also designated as L-34 and RL-29 and studied independently by several laboratories. More recently, CBP35 (epsilon BP) was found to be equivalent to Mac-2, a surface marker on activated macrophages. Using rat epsilon BP cDNA, we have succeeded in expressing recombinant epsilon BP in Escherichia coli. Milligram quantities of homogeneous epsilon BP could be obtained from bacterial lysate in a one-step affinity purification procedure utilizing lactosyl-Sepharose 4B and elution with a lactose gradient. The recombinant epsilon BP (r epsilon BP) binds mouse IgE and retains reactivity to anti-peptide antibodies specific for a sequence within rat epsilon BP. The purified r epsilon BP exhibits binding activity to various saccharides, with affinity for N-acetyllactosamine greater than thiodigalactoside greater than lactose much greater than D-galactose greater than L-arabinose, an order identical to that exhibited by native epsilon BP isolated from RBL cells. The recombinant lectin displayed hemagglutination activity when tested with rabbit erythrocytes. Although epsilon BP shares sequence homology to other lectins containing S-type (thiol-dependent) carbohydrate-recognition domains, r epsilon BP is resistant to air oxidation and does not require reducing agents for maintaining its activity. Furthermore, the single cysteine residue appears to be unexposed and can be alkylated only when the protein is denatured in 5.6 M guanidinium hydrochloride. The availability of a source for a large quantity of epsilon BP should facilitate the analysis of biological function(s) and structure-activity relationships of this lectin."
https://openalex.org/W1560930203,"Structure-function relationships of recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (CHE) variants were investigated by Xenopus oocyte microinjection. A Ser-425 to Pro-425 mutation failed to modify ligand binding properties. In contrast, Asp-70 to Gly-70 substitution significantly reduced CHE binding capacity for succinylcholine and specific inhibitors, demonstrating Asp-70 as a key anionic site component for certain ligands. Furthermore, the presence of both mutations rendered CHE totally resistant to succinylcholine and dibucaine inhibition, while all mutant proteins bound butyrylthiocholine, benzoylcholine, and propionylcholine normally. These findings imply structural interactions between the conserved Asp-70 and Ser-425 regions in cholinesterases and suggest the contribution of additional electronegative amino acids to anionic site binding."
https://openalex.org/W80983735,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) transfectants expressing human insulin receptors that were mutated at tyrosines 1162 and 1163 (CHO-Y2 cells) exhibit decreased insulin stimulation of both receptor tyrosine kinase and 2-deoxyglucose uptake compared with transfectants expressing wild-type human insulin receptors (CHO-R cells). We now provide evidence that insulin stimulation of myristoyl-diacylglycerol (DAG) production is also markedly impaired in CHO-Y2 cells; this is manifested as a decreased responsiveness and sensitivity to insulin as compared with CHO-R and parental CHO cells. Further, we report that (i) the concentration-response curves of insulin-stimulated myristoyl-DAG production and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were superimposable within each of the three cell lines. (ii) The insulin-induced increase in myristoyl-DAG production preceded that in 2-deoxyglucose uptake, and the time course was altered for both responses in CHO-Y2 cells. (iii) Insulin also increased the phosphorylation of a 40-kDa protein known to be a substrate for protein kinase C, but to a much lesser extent in CHO-Y2 cells than in CHO-R cells. (iv) Exogenously added 1,2-dimyristoyl-glycerol and 4 beta-phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate (PMA) again stimulated both the phosphorylation of the 40-kDa protein and 2-deoxyglucose uptake, but in contrast to insulin, they elicited the same level of response in both CHO-R and CHO-Y2 cells. (v) Finally, in protein kinase C-depleted CHO-R cells, insulin and PMA stimulation of 40-kDa protein phosphorylation as well as PMA stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake were completely abolished whereas insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose uptake was only partially decreased. Taken together, these results suggest that insulin stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake involves myristoyl-DAG production and, at least in part, protein kinase C activation, all three of these processes being controlled by receptor tyrosines 1162 and 1163."
https://openalex.org/W1564751166,"The gene 32 protein of the bacteriophage T4 is required for efficient genetic recombination in infected Eschericia coli cells and strongly stimulates in vitro pairing catalyzed by the phage uvsX protein, a RecA-like strand transferase. This helix-destabilizing factor is known to bind tightly and cooperatively to single-stranded DNA and to interact specifically with the uvsX protein as well as other phage gene products. However, its detailed role in homologous pairing is not well understood. I show here that when the efficiency of uvsX protein-mediated pairing is examined at different gene 32 protein and duplex DNA concentrations, a correlation between the two is found, suggesting that the two interact in a functionally important manner during the reaction. These and other data are consistent with a model in which the gene 32 protein binds to the strand displaced from the recipient duplex during pairing, thereby stabilizing the heteroduplex product. An alternative model in which the gene 32 protein replaces UvsX on the invading strand, thereby freeing the strand transferase to bind to the displaced strand, is also considered."
https://openalex.org/W1485912696,"N-Hydroxytyrosine, (E)- and (Z)-p-hydroxyphenyl-acetaldehyde oxime, p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile, and p-hydroxymandelonitrile are established intermediates in the biosynthesis of the tyrosine-derived cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin (Halkier, B. A., Olsen, C. E., and Moller, B. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 19487-19494. Simultaneous measurements of oxygen consumption and biosynthetic activity using a microsomal enzyme system isolated from etiolated sorghum seedlings demonstrate a requirement for three oxygen molecules in the conversion of tyrosine to p-hydroxymandelonitrile. Two oxygen molecules are consumed in the conversion of tyrosine to (E)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime, indicating the existence of a previously undetected hydroxylation step in addition to that resulting in the formation of N-hydroxytyrosine. Radioactively labeled 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane was chemically synthesized and tested as a possible intermediate. Biosynthetic experiments demonstrate that the microsomal enzyme system metabolizes the nitro compound to the subsequent intermediates in dhurrin synthesis (Km = 0.05 mM; Vmax = 14 nmol/mg of protein/h). Low amounts of 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane are produced in the microsomal reaction mixtures when tyrosine is used as substrate. These data support the involvement of 1-nitro-2-(p-hydroxyphenyl)ethane or more likely its aci-nitro tautomer as an intermediate between N-hydroxytyrosine and p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime. The conversion of (E)-p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehydeoxime to p-hydroxymandelonitrile requires a single oxygen molecule. The oxygen molecule is utilized for hydroxylation of p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile into p-hydroxymandelonitrile. This indicates that the conversion of p-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde oxime into p-hydroxyphenylacetonitrile proceeds by a simple dehydration reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1495512922,"The aggregating cartilage proteoglycan core protein contains two globular domains near the N terminus (G1 and G2) and one near the C terminus (G3). The G1-G3 domains contain 10, 8, and 10 cysteine residues, respectively. The disulfide assignments of the G1 domain have previously been deduced (Neame, P. J., Christner, J. E., and Baker, J. R. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 17768-17778) as Cys1-Cys2, Cys3-Cys6, Cys4-Cys5, Cys7-Cys10, and Cys8-Cys9, in which the numbers cited after the half-cystine residues are their relative positions from the N terminus. Here we describe a method for the isolation of disulfide-bonded peptides from tryptic digests of bovine nasal cartilage monomer. Sequence analysis of these peptides has allowed us to confirm the pairings previously determined for the G1 domain and to assign a disulfide pattern for the G2 domain of Cys11-Cys14, Cys12-Cys13, Cys15-Cys18, and Cys16-Cys17, in which the Cys15-Cys18 pairing was deduced indirectly. Similarly, for the G3 domain, a pattern of Cys19-Cys20, Cys21-Cys24, Cys22-Cys23, Cys25-Cys27, and Cys26-Cys28 was assigned, in which the Cys22-Cys23 pair was deduced indirectly. The G2 domain therefore contains disulfide bonding which is characteristic of the tandem repeat structures found in the G1 domain and link protein, and the G3 domain contains the three disulfide linkages previously assigned to the family of C-type animal lectins. The method described here, which combines anion-exchange, cation-exchange, and reversed-phase chromatography, should have broad application to the isolation of disulfide-bonded peptides from other heavily glycosylated proteins and proteoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W1562643651,"Protein phosphorylation was investigated in the bacterium Acinetobacter calcoaceticus both in vivo and in vitro. In cells grown with [32P]orthophosphate, several radioactive phosphoproteins were detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. These proteins were shown to contain phosphoserine, phosphothreonine, and a relatively large proportion of phosphotyrosine residues. Incubation of cellular extracts with [gamma-32P] ATP also resulted in the phosphorylation of several proteins. At least four of them, namely an 81-kDa protein, were modified at tyrosine. No protein labeling occurred when extracts were incubated with [gamma-32P] ATP or [14C]ATP. Moreover, phosphoproteins were insensitive to snake venom phosphodiesterase. All together these results indicate that A. calcoaceticus harbors different protein kinases including a protein-tyrosine kinase activity. Further analysis of this activity showed that it has little, if any, functional similarity with eukaryotic protein-tyrosine kinases."
https://openalex.org/W2264655299,"Basic amino acid residues were introduced into an extracellular (periplasmic) domain, preceding a membrane-spanning hydrophobic domain, of SecY, an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein. The localization of the domain was monitored as to the alkaline phosphatase activity of TnPhoA fused adjacent to the domain. The alkaline phosphatase activity of such Escherichia coli cells drastically decreased when positive charges were introduced, indicating that on the introduction the SecY domain showed a change in localization from the periplasm to the cytoplasm. In another experiment, positive charges were introduced to the same periplasmic domain of another SecY-PhoA fusion protein, in which PhoA is fused to the cytoplasmic domain of SecY following the particular hydrophobic domain. The alkaline phosphatase activity increased drastically when positive charges were introduced, indicating that the SecY domain fused to PhoA showed a change in localization from the cytoplasm to the periplasm. In both experiments, the removal of a large amino-terminal portion of the SecY domain did not alter the effect of the positive charge introduction. Changes in localization of SecY domains thus demonstrated were also supported by a protease accessibility test on spheroplasts. It is proposed that a positively charged region adjacent to a membrane-embedded hydrophobic region tends to be stabilized on the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane, which in turn endows the hydrophobic region with the ability to act as a stop-transfer sequence or a signal sequence and consequently determines the orientation of the hydrophobic region in the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1529351261,"Molecular cloning and sequencing of a full-length cDNA encoding the rat liver mitochondrial phosphate transporter (H+/Pi symporter) has revealed its primary structure (Ferreira, G. C. Pratt, R. D., and Pedersen, P. L. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 15628-15633). To date, no experimental data pertinent to the membrane topology of this transporter are available. For this reason, four different peptides which represent different regions of the H+/Pi symporter were synthesized and used to raise polyclonal antibodies. Each of the antipeptide antibodies exhibits immunoreactivity with its synthetic peptide antigen, but only antiserum against a COOH-terminal peptide reacts with the native transporter, suggesting that the other peptides are either conformally restricted or located in the interior of the protein. Competitive radioimmunoassays, using intact (outer membrane-free mitochondria) and inverted inner membrane vesicles, show that the COOH-terminal antibodies bind only to the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane, indicating that the COOH terminus of the protein is normally exposed to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. In support of this conclusion, tryptic digestion of mitoplasts but not of the inside-out vesicles, cleaves the antigenic site for the COOH-terminal antibodies. In other experiments, it was shown that N-ethylmalemide, a sulfhydryl alkylating agent known to inhibit the mitochondrial phosphate transporter, markedly reduces the accessibility of the COOH terminus to trypsin. These studies provide the first direct experimental data relevant to the membrane topology of the mitochondrial H+/Pi symporter. In addition, they support the view that alkylation of a reactive cysteine residue induces a significant conformational change in the transporter."
https://openalex.org/W1519428363,"Abstract The products derived from the metabolism of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) by mouse peritoneal macrophages were characterized by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and GC-mass spectrometry. HPLC analysis demonstrated two predominant polar products and several minor ones. The proportion and amounts of these products were dependent on the concentration of 12-HETE, the number of macrophages incubated with the monohydroxy fatty acid, and the time of incubation. The products identified by GC-mass spectrometry suggested that 12-HETE had undergone beta-oxidation. The intermediates identified were: 3,12-dihydroxy-5,8,10,14, 20:4; 10-hydroxy-3,6,8,12, 18:4; 3,10-dihydroxy-6,8,12, 18:3; 8-hydroxy-4,6,10, 16:3; 6-hydroxy-4,8, 14:2; and 4-hydroxy, 12:1. The major products, as identified by HPLC and GC-mass spectrometry, were 8-hydroxy-4,6,10, 16:3 and 4-hydroxy, 12:1. A minor product, 10-hydroxy-6,8,12, 18:3 was postulated to arise from either the isomerization and reduction of 10-hydroxy-3,6,8,12, 18:4 or from chain elongation of 8-hydroxy-4,6,10, 16:3. Inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase activities by ibuprofen and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, respectively, did not inhibit the formation of these products. 82% to 98% of 12-HETE was converted and released into the medium as products of beta-oxidation. The remainder was taken up into cellular lipids. beta-Oxidation of 12-HETE was decreased by only 12 and 21% after inhibiting mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation by 89 and 93% by 5 and 100 microM concentrations of the mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation inhibitor, methyl palmoxirate, respectively. It is thus postulated that the beta-oxidation of 12-HETE by mouse peritoneal macrophages occurs in peroxisomes."
https://openalex.org/W206493861,"[5,8-13C2]Spermidine was prepared by synthesis, and its binding to macromolecular structures of Escherichia coli was studied. When added to E. coli cells, the two signals of [13C]spermidine (C-5, 47.8 ppm, and C-8, 39.6 ppm; JC-C = 5.8 Hz) were strongly broadened due to binding to macromolecules. When [13C]spermidine was added to E. coli tRNA, the C-5 resonance broadened to v1/2 = 4.7 Hz, whereas the C-8 resonance broadened to v1/2 = 2.7 Hz. tRNA-bound [13C]spermidine could be chased by [12C]spermidine or spermine, but not by putrescine or cadaverine. By using mixtures of [5-13C]- and [8-13C]spermidines (where 13C-13C coupling was avoided), it was possible to estimate a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3 x 10(-3) M using the C-5 v1/2obs values and a Kd of 2.10(-3) M using the C-8 v1/2obs values. The number of spermidine-binding sites (n) could also be estimated by fitting the bound spermidine molar fraction versus tRNA concentration. Values of n = 12 +/- 2 and 14 +/- 3 were obtained for C-5 and C-8, respectively. Measurements of line narrowing at increasing Mg2+ concentrations indicated that approximately 11 spermidines (of the 12-14 bound ones) could be displaced by the former, whereas 3 spermidines remain strongly bound to the tRNA backbone. Measurements of free and bound T1 allowed the determination of a correlation time of 10(-10)s for tRNA-bound spermidine."
https://openalex.org/W1559020696,"Kidney, ureter, kidney artery, and kidney vein tissue were obtained from a single human transplant specimen. The donors erythrocyte blood group phenotype was A1Le(a-b+). Total non-acid glycolipid fractions were isolated and individual glycolipid components were identified by immunostaining thin layer plates with a panel of monoclonal antibodies and by mass spectrometry of the permethylated and permethylated-reduced total glycolipid fractions. The dominating glycolipids in all tissues were mono- to tetraglycosylceramides. In the kidney, ureter, and artery tissue less than 1% of the glycolipids were of blood group type, having more than 4 sugar residues. In contrast, 14% of the vein glycolipids were of blood group type, and the dominating components were type 1 chain blood group H pentaglycosylceramides and A hexaglycosylceramides. Trace amounts of structurally different blood group A glycolipids (type 1 to 4 core saccharide chains) with up to 10 sugar residues were found in the kidney, ureter, and vein tissues, including evidence for a novel blood group A heptaglycosylceramide based on the type 3 chain in the vein. The only detected A glycolipid antigen in the artery tissue was the blood group A difucosyl type 1 chain heptaglycosylceramide (ALeb) structure. Blood group Lewis and related antigens (Lea, Leb, and ALeb) were expressed in the kidney, ureter, and artery, but were completely lacking in the vein, indicating that the Le gene-coded alpha 1-4-fucosyltransferase was not expressed in this tissue. The X and Y antigens (type 2 chain isomers of the Lea and Leb antigens) were detected only in the kidney tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1506735593,"Differential scanning calorimetry has been used to investigate the thermal stability of three different ceruloplasmins (from sheep, chicken, and turtle) in their native state and after limited proteolysis. The three undegraded proteins showed a similar structural organization in three calorimetric domains, although their temperature of unfolding varied from 57.8 degrees C (turtle) to 71.2 degrees C (sheep) to 82.1 degrees C (chicken). The spectroscopic and the catalytic properties were totally lost at temperatures corresponding to the unfolding of the less thermostable domain in the case of sheep and chicken ceruloplasmins and to the unfolding of the most thermostable domain in the turtle protein. Trypsin, but not plasmin, digestion caused a significant decrease of the thermal stability of sheep and chicken ceruloplasmins. Turtle ceruloplasmin was insensitive to both proteases. Comparing the thermodynamic parameters of the sheep protein in its undegraded and cleaved states revealed a mismatch between the three calorimetric domains and the 3-fold internal replication of the primary structure, which is evident in the highly homologous, fully sequenced human protein. Copper removal caused the rearrangement of the molecule in only two calorimetric domains, suggesting a role of the metal atoms in organizing a new calorimetric domain, which was tentatively assigned to the less thermostable cooperative unit of the native protein."
https://openalex.org/W1573905713,"The mechanism of lead toxicity at the cellular level remains unknown, although an effect of lead on intracellular Ca2+ has been described. Since bone is a major target for lead, we have investigated the effect of lead on bioenergetic rates and on the intracellular free Mg2+ concentration in cultured osteoblastic bone cells. Using 31P NMR and the saturation transfer technique we have detected a sizable (18%) transfer of saturation from gamma ATP to Pi in a perfused osteoblastic osteosarcoma bone cell line, Ros 17/2.8, and have found a large (greater than 82%) reduction in the Pi—-ATP rate upon treatment with 10 microM Pb2+. The NMR-measured unidirectional rate was much greater than the net rate of ATP synthesis through glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. By using iodoacetate we investigated the mechanism of the saturation transfer and found that it is catalyzed by the glycolytic enzyme couple glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase/phosphoglycerate kinase. The net rate of glycolysis as measured by lactate production and that of oxidative phosphorylation as measured by O2 consumption were found to be significantly decreased by 18 and 74%, respectively, with lead treatment. In addition, from the chemical shifts of intracellular ATP resonances, we found a significant reduction of 21% in the intracellular free Mg2+ concentration upon Pb2+ treatment. The observed lead-induced reduction in ATP synthesis/utilization and the decrease in intracellular free Mg2+ may contribute to the impairment of bone formation during lead intoxication."

https://openalex.org/W1501151513,"Two mutant lactose repressors, each containing a single tryptophan, were generated by site-specific mutagenesis. Tyrosine was substituted for tryptophan to be analogous to amber suppression mutants reported previously (Sommer, H., Lu, P., and Miller, J. H. (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 3774-3779). Unlike the amber suppression mutants, plasmids containing the mutant sequences produce large quantities of stable, easily isolable protein. The binding properties of the site-specific mutant repressors (W201Y, W220Y) differ from those reported for the corresponding suppression mutants (A201, A220). Whereas minimal effects on operator dissociation rate from lambda plac DNA were noted for the suppression mutants, purified W201Y and W220Y proteins exhibit 10- and 5-fold reduced affinity for a 40-base pair operator, respectively, compared with wild-type. Inducer binding of the A201 and W201Y mutants was similar to that for wild-type repressor, but the inducer affinity of W220Y was approximately 2-fold lower than A220 (approximately 30-fold lower than wild-type). Fluorescence spectra and iodide quenching of the mutant proteins were similar to the suppression mutants, but the absorption coefficient differed significantly from the values reported previously. Acrylamide and iodide quenching results indicate that Trp201 is relatively buried whereas Trp220 is exposed to solvent; inducer binding reduces quenching of Trp220 significantly. CD spectra indicate that the mutant proteins have secondary structural features similar to those of wild-type. Inducer UV difference spectra showed that the major features reported for the wild-type isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside difference spectrum were attributable to both tryptophans. In the presence of melibiose, a new minimum appeared in the difference spectra of wild-type and W201Y which was not evident when these proteins bound isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside. It is possible that this new feature results from Trp220 involvement in a direct contact with the second sugar in disaccharide inducer molecules such as melibiose and 1,6-allolactose."
https://openalex.org/W1646986799,"Renin is produced from a larger, inactive precursor, prorenin, through endoproteolytic cleavage at paired basic amino acids. Recently, we have purified and characterized an enzyme, which catalyzes the endoproteolytic process, from mouse submandibular gland. The enzyme, named prorenin converting enzyme, specifically cleaves the peptide bond on the COOH-side of the Arg residue at the Lys-Arg pair of mouse Ren 2 prorenin, but does not cleave mouse Ren 1 and human prorenins. In this study, by synthesizing a series of mutant mouse prorenins using site-directed mutagenesis and the Xenopus oocyte expression system, we have investigated the role of the basic pair as the recognition signal for the enzyme as well as the determinant of the substrate specificity. The results indicate that the basic amino acid at the COOH-side but not at the NH2-side of the basic pair of Ren 2 prorenin is essential for processing directed by prorenin converting enzyme, and that the Arg residue at the COOH-side is more preferable for processing than the Lys. The results also demonstrated that the presence of a Pro residue next to the Lys-Arg pair prevents the processing of Ren 1 prorenin."
https://openalex.org/W1665774172,"Abstract Liver glutaminase is stimulated by an increase in NH4+ concentration and NH4+ is an absolute requirement for activity at approximate physiological concentrations of phosphate and glutamine. Increases in the concentration of NH4+ cannot, however, overcome the inhibitory effect of a decrease in pH. In addition, the concentration of NH4+ required for half-maximal rate decreases as pH increases. This decrease is the result of two factors: a direct effect of pH on the apparent affinity of the enzyme for NH4+, and an indirect effect of pH brought about by an increase in the apparent affinity of the enzyme for phosphate which results in a further decrease in the M0.5 for NH4+. In addition, liver glutaminase responds strongly to the concentration of citrate over a physiologically relevant range at approximate physiological concentrations of NH4+, phosphate, and glutamine. An increase in citrate concentration stimulates glutaminase by increasing the affinity of the enzyme for glutamine. The apparent affinity of the enzyme for citrate increases as pH increases. The strong response of liver glutaminase to pH, NH4+, and citrate and the fact that the hydrolysis of glutamine can supply metabolites and effectors for urea synthesis suggest a possible regulatory role of glutaminase in ureagenesis."
