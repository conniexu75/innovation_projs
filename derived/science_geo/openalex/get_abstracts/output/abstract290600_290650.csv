https://openalex.org/W2013401864,"The worldwide distribution of volcanic ash has been determinmined from 320 deep-sea sections drilled during the Deep Sea Drilling Project. The ash distribution in the deep-sea sections, which span the last 20 million years, indicates that there has been a much higher rate of explosive volcanism from both island arc and hot spot volcanoes during the last 2 million years. This episode, and perhaps another in the Middle Miocene cprrelates with previously reported widespread synchronism in increased volcanicity in certain oceanic islands. Increased Quaternary volcanism coincides approximately with that episode of the Cenozoic marked by major and rapidly fluctuating climatic change."

The reduction could be as large as 3 percent by 1980, or 16 percent by 2000, if Freon consumption were to grow at 10 percent per year. Even if Freon use were terminated as early as 1990, it could leave a significant effect which might endure for several hundred years."

The OH-OD exchange for the inner-surface hydroxyls varies from 60 to 67 percent, whereas it is only 22 percent for the inner hydroxyls."
https://openalex.org/W2035269487,"Nitrogen fixation is associated with four shipworl species. A bacterium capable of fixing nitrogen under anaerobic conditions and of liquefying cellulose in culture has been isolated from the gut of one species. High fixation rates (up to 1.5 micrograms of nitrogen per milligram dry weight per hour), which resulted in a doubling of cellular nitrogen in as little as 1.4 days, was associated with Teredora malleolus from the Sargasso Sea. Three species from coastal waters were assayed, and of these juveniles showed the highest fixation rates. Nitrogen fixation activity appeared to be inversely related to the ability of shipworms to obtain combined-nitrogen compounds in their diet. It could be a significant source of nitrogen for shipwornms and perhaps other oceanic organisms that ingest terrestrial plant material."
https://openalex.org/W1972354037,"The low-density minerals that make up the bulk of rocks in the earth's crust, such as quartz and the feldspars, are transformed by high pressure into much denser phases. In some cases the products of these transitions are new phases that were first discovered in the laboratory; in other cases they are minerals such as kyanite, jadeite, and pyrope, which have long been known as constituents of metamorphic rocks. Determinations of the stability fields of these high-pressure minerals show that either metamorphism of sedimentary rocks takes place at much greater depth than has hitherto been supposed or pressures generated by orogenic forces may have significantly augmented the hydrostatic pressure. The second alternative seems unlikely, but lack of information on the strength of rocks during metamorphism makes the matter uncertain. Geophysical and petrological observations indicate that the dominant rock type in the upper mantle is garnet peridotite. However, there is reason to believe that the mantle is inhomogeneous and that a variety of rocks ranging in bulk composition from eclogite to peridotite are present. Hydrous phases, such as amphiboles, are possible constituents in the upper 100 kilometers. The hypothesis that the MohoroviciÄ‡ discontinuity is a dynamic equilibrium between basalt and eclogite seems improbable. The transition zone between the upper and lower mantle can be explained as a series of reactions in which silicates with the silicon ion in fourfold coordination are transformed into phases in which silicon is in six-fold coordination. This interpretation is supported by synthesis of stishovite, a polymorph of SiO(2) with rutile structure, and by syntheses of germanate pyroxenes with ilmenite structure. Data on the melting of silicates at pressures up to 50 kilobars show that the initial dT/dP slopes of silicate melting curves are much steeper than those of metals but that they show considerable curvature. The increase of melting temperature with pressure should be much more pronounced near the top of the mantle than at greater depth."
https://openalex.org/W2089050473,"Soviet observations of anomalously low values of the ratio of the compressional wave velocity to the shear wave velocity (V(p)/ V(s)) in a restricted volume around the locus of a future earthquake are duplicated by models based on the dilatancy hypothesis. In nature the cracks that cause the dilation may be oriented, leading to anisotropic seismic wave propagation in the anomalous region. The models show that vertical cracks are most effective in producing the observed effects, but that a slightly higher density of randomly oriented cracks will yield similar effects. The premonitory observations at Blue Mountain Lake, New York, are also duplicated by the models. These models demonstrate that V(p)/V(s) measured at the surface is not that of the anomalous zone, but is related to it by a transfer function, involving the shape and velocity gradient of the zone boundary."

https://openalex.org/W2029047206,"Sediment fall-velocities measured by the Woods Hole Rapid Sediment Analyzer can now be obtained directly on punched paper tape in a form suitable for processing by a computer. This technique saves much time because it eliminates manual card punching, a step in which an operator transfers values from sediment analyses to punch cards in order to make the data acceptable tocomputers."

https://openalex.org/W2088482806,"It is demonstrated that the empirical relationship between activation energy of viscosity and the melting point of a metal is also true for the energy of self-diffusion, in view of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The provision is that viscosity and self-diffusion be expressed in a self-consistent manner, as provided, for example, by the J. Frenkel's theory of liquids. Thus, one can now estimate either the viscosity or the self-diffusion of any metal over a substantial temperature range from its known melting point."
