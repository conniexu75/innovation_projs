https://openalex.org/W3162218953,"The isocortex and hippocampal formation (HPF) in the mammalian brain play critical roles in perception, cognition, emotion, and learning. We profiled ∼1.3 million cells covering the entire adult mouse isocortex and HPF and derived a transcriptomic cell-type taxonomy revealing a comprehensive repertoire of glutamatergic and GABAergic neuron types. Contrary to the traditional view of HPF as having a simpler cellular organization, we discover a complete set of glutamatergic types in HPF homologous to all major subclasses found in the six-layered isocortex, suggesting that HPF and the isocortex share a common circuit organization. We also identify large-scale continuous and graded variations of cell types along isocortical depth, across the isocortical sheet, and in multiple dimensions in hippocampus and subiculum. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian isocortex and hippocampal formation and begins to shed light on its underlying relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity, and function of these two brain structures."
https://openalex.org/W3162916603,"Glycans modify lipids and proteins to mediate inter- and intramolecular interactions across all domains of life. RNA is not thought to be a major target of glycosylation. Here, we challenge this view with evidence that mammals use RNA as a third scaffold for glycosylation. Using a battery of chemical and biochemical approaches, we found that conserved small noncoding RNAs bear sialylated glycans. These ""glycoRNAs"" were present in multiple cell types and mammalian species, in cultured cells, and in vivo. GlycoRNA assembly depends on canonical N-glycan biosynthetic machinery and results in structures enriched in sialic acid and fucose. Analysis of living cells revealed that the majority of glycoRNAs were present on the cell surface and can interact with anti-dsRNA antibodies and members of the Siglec receptor family. Collectively, these findings suggest the existence of a direct interface between RNA biology and glycobiology, and an expanded role for RNA in extracellular biology."

Here we report Day 42 interim safety and immunogenicity data from an observer-blinded, dose escalation, randomized controlled study of a virus-like particle vaccine candidate produced in plants that displays the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (CoVLP: NCT04450004 ). The co-primary outcomes were the short-term tolerability/safety and immunogenicity of CoVLP formulations assessed by neutralizing antibody (NAb) and cellular responses. Secondary outcomes in this ongoing study include safety and immunogenicity assessments up to 12 months after vaccination. Adults (18-55 years, n = 180) were randomized at two sites in Quebec, Canada, to receive two intramuscular doses of CoVLP (3.75 μg, 7.5 μg, and 15 μg) 21 d apart, alone or adjuvanted with AS03 or CpG1018. All formulations were well tolerated, and adverse events after vaccination were generally mild to moderate, transient and highest in the adjuvanted groups. There was no CoVLP dose effect on serum NAbs, but titers increased significantly with both adjuvants. After the second dose, NAbs in the CoVLP + AS03 groups were more than tenfold higher than titers in Coronavirus 2019 convalescent sera. Both spike protein-specific interferon-γ and interleukin-4 cellular responses were also induced. This pre-specified interim analysis supports further evaluation of the CoVLP vaccine candidate."

Low et al. defined and estimated the CD4 + T cell repertoire of convalescent COVID-19 patients. After sorting various CD4 + T cell subsets, they generated numerous T cell clones that reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. A large number of T cell clones from almost all individuals recognized a small conserved immunodominant region within the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD). The researchers isolated T cell clones that broadly reacted to the spike protein of other coronaviruses, providing evidence for the recall of preexisting cross-reactive memory T cells after SARS-CoV-2 infection.

https://openalex.org/W3161732928,"<h2>Summary</h2> Understanding lineage specification during human pre-implantation development is a gateway to improving assisted reproductive technologies and stem cell research. Here we employ pseudotime analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data to reconstruct early mouse and human embryo development. Using time-lapse imaging of annotated embryos, we provide an integrated, ordered, and continuous analysis of transcriptomics changes throughout human development. We reveal that human trophectoderm/inner cell mass transcriptomes diverge at the transition from the B2 to the B3 blastocyst stage, just before blastocyst expansion. We explore the dynamics of the fate markers IFI16 and GATA4 and show that they gradually become mutually exclusive upon establishment of epiblast and primitive endoderm fates, respectively. We also provide evidence that NR2F2 marks trophectoderm maturation, initiating from the polar side, and subsequently spreads to all cells after implantation. Our study pinpoints the precise timing of lineage specification events in the human embryo and identifies transcriptomics hallmarks and cell fate markers."

Spatiotemporal control of gene expression is essential for appropriate organismal development and to direct functional responses to a range of intrinsic and extrinsic cellular cues (Roeder, 2019Roeder R.G. 50+ years of eukaryotic transcription: an expanding universe of factors and mechanisms.Nat.

Following transcription initiation, RNAPII arrests shortly after transcribing the first 60–100 base pairs (bp) of most genes and acquires a “paused” conformation, stabilized by the DRB sensitivity inducing factor (DSIF) and the negative elongation factor (NELF) (Chen et al., 2018Chen F.X.

P-TEFb activity is mediated by its recruitment to the transcriptional pause site by transcription factors such as c-MYC (Eberhardy and Farnham, 2001Eberhardy S.R.

The observation that transcriptional processes are fundamentally dysregulated in cancer and that P-TEFb interacts with oncogenic transcription factors such as c-MYC and MLL-fusion proteins (Bradner et al., 2017Bradner J.E.

P-TEFb as A Promising Therapeutic Target.Molecules. 2020; 25: 8385Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar). Despite extensive literature on the various RNAPII-CTD kinases including the “transcriptional kinases” (CDK7–CDK9 and CDK11–CDK13), less is known about the phosphatases that target RNAPII-CTD and oppose P-TEFb kinase activity (Jeronimo et al., 2016Jeronimo C. Collin P. Robert F. The RNA Polymerase II CTD: The Increasing Complexity of a Low-Complexity Protein Domain.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 2607-2622Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A dedicated set of phosphatases have been demonstrated to de-phosphorylate RNAPII-CTD in mammals and lower organisms, which is particularly important for RNAPII recycling (Mayfield et al., 2016Mayfield J.E. Burkholder N.T. Zhang Y.J. Dephosphorylating eukaryotic RNA polymerase II.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1864: 372-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Recently, CDK9-mediated phosphorylation of SPT5, a component of DSIF, was shown to be opposed by PP1 and PP4 during the transition from elongation to termination and at promoter proximal regions, respectively (Parua et al., 2018Parua P.K. Booth G.T. Sansó M. Benjamin B. Tanny J.C. Lis J.T. Fisher R.P.

Commun. 2020; 11: 4338Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This provides evidence for functional interplay between kinases and phosphatases to dynamically regulate the core transcriptional machinery. Here, we used genome-wide CRISPR-screens to identify genes that regulate CDK9i-induced cell death and override the block in productive elongation. Deletion of INTS6, a component of the Integrator complex, suppressed CDK9i-induced cell death and allowed for transcriptional elongation in transformed and untransformed cell lines and across species. The 14-subunit Integrator complex associates with the RNAPII-CTD and cleaves nascent RNA species such as U small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) (Lai et al., 2015Lai F. Gardini A.

Integrator complex and transcription regulation: Recent findings and pathophysiology.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2016; 1859: 1269-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, Integrator was reported to regulate RNAPII pausing and elongation through its RNA-directed catalytic subunits INTS11/INTS9 (Elrod et al., 2019Elrod N.D. Henriques T. Huang K.L. Tatomer D.C. Wilusz J.E. Wagner E.J. Adelman K. The Integrator Complex Attenuates Promoter-Proximal Transcription at Protein-Coding Genes.Mol.

Cell. 2014; 56: 128-139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here, we uncovered that INTS6, INTS8, and the PP2A phosphatase (Int-PP2A) form a distinct functional module of Integrator that is recruited to actively transcribed genes to oppose CDK9 activity by controlling the phosphorylation turnover of key CDK9 substrates, including the RNAPII-CTD and DSIF. These discoveries provided a molecular rationale to combine CDK9i with small molecule activators of PP2A (SMAPs), which led to enhanced transcriptional pausing and synergistic therapeutic efficacy in MLL-rearranged AML and solid tumors. We reveal how RNAPII-driven transcription is fine-tuned through the PP2A-Integrator-CDK9 axis, and the opposing enzymatic activities of CDK9 and PP2A present a viable therapeutic target for solid and hematopoietic malignancies. To identify proteins that functionally antagonize CDK9 activity on both the phenotypic and transcriptional level, we performed a series of genome-wide CRISPR-screens on MLL-rearranged leukemia cell lines THP-1 and MV4;11 treated with CDK9 inhibitors (CDK9i) using the following readouts: (1) long-term cell survival, and (2) nascent RNA transcription (Figure 1A). Cell survival screens performed in THP-1 cells treated with the CDK9i AZ5576, A159, or Dinaciclib (Wu et al., 2020Wu T. Qin Z. Tian Y. Wang J. Xu C. Li Z. Bian J. Recent Developments in the Biology and Medicinal Chemistry of CDK9 Inhibitors: An Update.J. Med. Chem. 2020; 63: 13228-13257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) revealed selective enrichment of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) targeting the Integrator complex subunit INTS6 (Figure 1B, left). This was reproduced in analogous screens in MV4;11 cells (Figures 1B, right, and S1A; Table S1), confirming that deletion of INTS6 conferred resistance to CDK9i. To directly assess antagonism to CDK9 inhibition on a transcriptional level, we used a flow cytometry-based readout of nascent RNA production using click chemistry-based fluorescent 5-ethynyl uridine (EU) labeling (Figure S1B). As expected, CDK9i treatment of THP-1 cells resulted in a time- and dose-dependent reduction of EU incorporation (Figure S1C). Using genome-wide CRISPR-KO libraries, we screened for THP-1 cells that retained EU incorporation, and therefore transcription, in the presence of CDK9i (Figure S1D). sgRNAs targeting INTS6 were significantly enriched (Figures 1C, 1D, and S1E), revealing INTS6 as the only gene consistently identified across all screens (Figure 1E; Table S1). In contrast, the majority of Integrator subunits did not score significantly, although enrichment of sgRNAs targeting INTS8 and INTS12 was observed in individual phenotypic and transcription screens (Figure S1F), suggesting a possible role in regulating the CDK9i response. In competitive proliferation assays, INTS6 deletion conferred a strong survival advantage to THP-1 and MV4;11 cells treated with AZ5576 (CDK9i) compared to scrambled sgRNA-expressing control cells, with no competitive advantage to DMSO-treated cells (Figures 1F–1H and S1G). INTS6 deletion desensitized cells to CDK9i-induced apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner (Figures 1I and S1H), and conferred a survival advantage to targeted degradation of CDK9 using a proteolysis targeting chimera (22-533) (Figures S1I and S1J). Finally, INTS6 loss conferred resistance to CDK9 inhibition using the ATP analog 1-NA-PP1 in THP-1 cells engineered to express analog-sensitive CDK9 alleles (CDK9AS/AS) (Figures 1J, 1K, and S1K), demonstrating that the resistance observed is not the result of off-target effects of the small molecule CDK9i (Gressel et al., 2017Gressel S. Schwalb B. Decker T.M. Qin W. Leonhardt H. Eick D. Cramer P. CDK9-dependent RNA polymerase II pausing controls transcription initiation.eLife. 2017; 6: e29736Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Disruption of the Integrator complex through deletion of INTS3 and INTS11 did not confer resistance to CDK9 inhibition (Figures S1L and S1M). INTS6 loss did not provide a competitive advantage for small molecule inhibition of other transcriptional CDKs (t-CDKs) CDK7, CDK11, or CDK12/13 and did not confer resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine (Figures 1L and S1N), highlighting the specificity of the INTS6 deletion phenotype. Importantly, ectopic expression of INTS6 re-sensitized cells with INTS6 loss to CDK9i (Figures S1O–S1Q), and INTS6 deletion allowed for efficient EU incorporation in the presence of CDK9i compared to control cells (Figure S1R). Moreover, INTS6 loss was associated with acquired resistance to CDK9i in MV4;11 cells cultured under selective pressure of increasing CDK9i doses for 11 weeks (Figure S1S). INTS6 deletion also provided competitive advantage to CDK9i in HeLa, MM1.S, and two non-transformed cell lines (HS-5 and BJ-T) (Figures 1M–1P and S1T). Analogous results were obtained following deletion of IntS6 in D. melanogaster-derived S2 cells, a phenotype that was rescued by ectopic expression of full-length IntS6 protein (Figures 1Q, S1U, and S1V). These data show that experimental or acquired loss of INTS6 confers a selective resistance to CDK9i across species and cell lines, which is independent from disruption of the Integrator complex, off-target effects, or general antagonism of t-CDKs. To determine how INTS6 regulates the transcriptional and biological responses to CDK9i, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed to investigate the INTS6/Integrator interactome. Immunoprecipitation (IP) of INTS6 from THP-1 and MV4;11 whole cell lysates revealed co-purification of the other 13 Integrator complex members, RNAPII core subunits, and enrichment of PP2A phosphatase complex subunits PPP2R1A/PPP2R1B and PP2A-C/PPP2CB (Figures 2A, S2A, and S2B; Fowle et al., 2019Fowle H. Zhao Z. Graña X. PP2A holoenzymes, substrate specificity driving cellular functions and deregulation in cancer.Adv. Cancer Res. 2019; 144: 55-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Affinity purification of PP2A-C from HeLa nuclear extracts identified Integrator and RNAPII as the most abundant interactors of nuclear PP2A, with the reciprocal IP for INTS6 identifying all Integrator complex subunits, RNAPII, PPP2R1A, and PP2A-C (Figure 2B). Similar results were obtained in epitope tagged IntS6 IP-MS experiments in D. melanogaster S2 cells, attesting to the evolutionary conservation of the Integrator, PP2A, and RNAPII association (Figure S2C). Altogether, these data reveal an interaction network between Integrator, RNAPII and PP2A as well as the catalytic subunit of the PP1 phosphatase (Figures 2A–2C). The interaction between endogenous PP2A and INTS6 was validated by coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) in THP-1 cells through endogenous V5-tagged PPP2R1A and in HeLa cells through endogenous INTS6 (Figures 2D and 2E).Figure S2INTS6 bridges the interaction between Integrator and PP2A, related to Figure 2Show full captionLog2 iBAQ scores of proteins identified in INTS6 IP versus mouse IgG isotype control IP mass spectrometry experiments for A.

Although most PP2A is cytoplasmic, sub-cellular fractionation of HeLa cells indicated that a substantial fraction of the phosphatase complex is found in the nuclear compartment and the insoluble chromatin fraction, where the Integrator complex is also detected (Figure S2D). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated depletion of INTS6 in HeLa cells abrogated the interaction between PP2A-C and components of Integrator complex and RNAPII compared to shLuciferase (LUC) control cells (Figure 2F). Depletion of INTS6 and Integrator subunits 5, 8, and 12 revealed that the PP2A-C interaction was unperturbed by depletion of either INTS5 or INTS12, but was greatly diminished following loss of INTS6 and INTS8 (Figures 2G and S2E), suggesting that INTS8 also contributes to PP2A recruitment to Integrator. Loss of the Integrator-PP2A interaction was similarly observed in THP-1 cells on deletion of INTS6 in coIP experiments between INTS11 and PP2A-C (Figures 2H and S2F). INTS6 or INTS8 loss did not impact the catalytic activity or structural integrity of the Integrator complex because their depletion did not increase misprocessed UsnRNAs or perturb migration of the Integrator complex on a glycerol gradient, in contrast to the depletion of the core-subunit INTS2 (Figures 2I, 2J, S2G, and S2H). Interestingly, although INTS8 was required for INTS6 recruitment, depletion of INTS6 did not impact INTS8 incorporation into the Integrator complex (Figures S2H–S2J). These data demonstrate that INTS6 and INTS8 are part of an Integrator module responsible for recruitment of PP2A that is functionally and structurally distinct from the catalytic INTS4/9/11 module. To investigate co-localization of Integrator, PP2A, and CDK9 complexes across the genome, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) was performed in THP-1 cells for CDK9, BRD4, RNAPII, INTS6, INTS11, and PPP2R1A. Similar to BRD4, RNAPII, and CDK9, Integrator subunits INTS6 and INTS11 and the PP2A subunit PPP2R1A localized to regions at or around transcription start sites (TSS) (Figure 3A). CDK9i treatment resulted in retention of RNAPII at TSS-proximal regions, consistent with the induction of transcriptional pausing concomitant with an increase in chromatin-bound CDK9 (Figures 3A, 3B, and S3A). CDK9i-induced CDK9 recruitment was also observed in INTS6 KO cells, albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting that resistance mediated by INTS6 loss does not arise from increased CDK9 recruitment to chromatin (Figure S3B). BRD4 and INTS11 also accumulated at the TSS following CDK9i treatment, consistent with the physical interaction between either BRD4 (Jang et al., 2005Jang M.K. Mochizuki K. Zhou M. Jeong H.S.

In the United States, allocation frameworks are determined by each of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s 64 jurisdictions (50 states, the District of Columbia, five cities and eight territories). In this study, we analyzed vaccine allocation plans published by 8 November 2020, tracking updates through to 30 March 2021. We evaluated whether jurisdictions adopted proposals to reduce inequity using disadvantage indices and related place-based measures. By 30 March 2021, 14 jurisdictions had prioritized specific zip codes in combination with metrics such as COVID-19 incidence, and 37 jurisdictions (including 34 states) had adopted disadvantage indices, compared to 19 jurisdictions in November 2020. Uptake of indices doubled from 7 to 14 among the jurisdictions with the largest shares of disadvantaged communities. Five applications were distinguished: (1) prioritizing disadvantaged groups through increased shares of vaccines or vaccination appointments; (2) defining priority groups or areas; (3) tailoring outreach and communication; (4) planning the location of dispensing sites; and (5) monitoring receipt. To ensure that equity features centrally in allocation plans, policymakers at the federal, state and local levels should universalize the uptake of disadvantage indices and related place-based measures. An analysis of COVID-19 vaccine allocation frameworks in the United States across 64 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention jurisdictions reveals that, as of 31 March 2021, 37 jurisdictions had adopted disadvantage indices to reduce health disparities. The analysis also highlights the importance of vaccine prioritization based on health and place."

Some studies have found that COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse mental health consequences. Individual differences such as personality could contribute to people’s behaviors during a pandemic. In the current study, we examine how personality traits of neuroticism and extroversion (using the Five-Factor Model as our framework) are related to the mental health of Canadians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from an online survey with 1096 responses, this study performed multiple regression analysis to explore how personality traits of neuroticism and extroversion predict the effects of COVID-19 on the mental health of Canadians. The results showed that personality traits of neuroticism and extroversion are associated with the current mental health of Canadians during COVID-19 pandemic, with extroversion positively related to mental health and neuroticism negatively related to it. Results contribute to the management of individual responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and could help public health services provide personality-appropriate mental health services during this pandemic."

Therapeutics targeting different components and processes of the viral infection replication cycle are being investigated, particularly to repurpose already approved drugs. Spike protein is an important target for both vaccines and therapeutics. Insights into the mechanisms of spike-ACE2 binding and cell fusion could support the identification of compounds with inhibitory effects. Here, we demonstrate that the integrity of disulfide bonds within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) plays an important role in the membrane fusion process although their disruption does not prevent binding of spike protein to ACE2. Several reducing agents and thiol-reactive compounds are able to inhibit viral entry. N-acetyl cysteine amide, L-ascorbic acid, JTT-705, and auranofin prevented syncytia formation, viral entry into cells, and infection in a mouse model, supporting disulfides of the RBD as a therapeutically relevant target."
https://openalex.org/W3160390118,"Understanding how the brain allocates resources to match the demands of active neurons under physiological conditions is critically important. Increased metabolic demands of active brain regions are matched with hemodynamic responses known as neurovascular coupling (NVC). Several methods that allow noninvasive assessment of brain activity in humans detect NVC and early detection of NVC impairment may serve as an early marker of cognitive impairment. Therefore, non-invasive NVC assessments may serve as a valuable tool to detect early signs of cognitive impairment and dementia. Working memory tasks are routinely employed in the evaluation of cognitive task-evoked NVC responses. However, recent attempts that utilized functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) or transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) while using a similar working memory paradigm did not provide convincing evidence for the correlation of the hemodynamic variables measured by these two methods. In the current study, we aimed to compare fNIRS and TCD in their performance of differentiating NVC responses evoked by different levels of working memory workload during the same working memory task used as cognitive stimulation. Fourteen healthy young individuals were recruited for this study and performed an n -back cognitive test during TCD and fNIRS monitoring. During TCD monitoring, the middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow was bilaterally increased during the task associated with greater cognitive effort. fNIRS also detected significantly increased activation during a more challenging task in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and in addition, widespread activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was also revealed. Robust changes in prefrontal cortex hemodynamics may explain the profound change in MCA blood flow during the same cognitive task. Overall, our data support our hypothesis that both TCD and fNIRS methods can discriminate NVC evoked by higher demand tasks compared to baseline or lower demand tasks."

In March 2020, the World Health Organization determined that the COVID–19 outbreak is a global pandemic. The urgency and magnitude of this pandemic demanded immediate action and coordination between local, regional, national, and international actors. In that mission, researchers require access to high-quality biological materials and data from SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected patients, covering the spectrum of disease manifestations. The “Biobanque québécoise de la COVID-19” (BQC19) is a pan–provincial initiative undertaken in Québec, Canada to enable the collection, storage and sharing of samples and data related to the COVID-19 crisis. As a disease-oriented biobank based on high-quality biosamples and clinical data of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive and negative individuals. The BQC19 follows a legal and ethical management framework approved by local health authorities. The biosamples include plasma, serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and DNA and RNA isolated from whole blood. In addition to the clinical variables, BQC19 will provide in-depth analytical data derived from the biosamples including whole genome and transcriptome sequencing, proteome and metabolome analyses, multiplex measurements of key circulating markers as well as anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses. BQC19 will provide the scientific and medical communities access to data and samples to better understand, manage and ultimately limit, the impact of COVID-19. In this paper we present BQC19, describe the process according to which it is governed and organized, and address opportunities for future research collaborations. BQC19 aims to be a part of a global communal effort addressing the challenges of COVID–19."
https://openalex.org/W3160426715,"Abstract The Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 22 (USP22) is a deubiquitinating subunit of the mammalian SAGA transcriptional co-activating complex. USP22 was identified as a member of the so-called “death-from-cancer” signature predicting therapy failure in cancer patients. However, the importance and functional role of USP22 in different types and subtypes of cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we leveraged human cell lines and genetic mouse models to investigate the role of USP22 in HER2-driven breast cancer (HER2 + -BC) and demonstrate for the first time that USP22 is required for the tumorigenic properties in murine and human HER2 + -BC models. To get insight into the underlying mechanisms, we performed transcriptome-wide gene expression analyses and identified the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) as a pathway deregulated upon USP22 loss. The UPR is normally induced upon extrinsic or intrinsic stresses that can promote cell survival and recovery if shortly activated or programmed cell death if activated for an extended period. Strikingly, we found that USP22 actively suppresses UPR induction in HER2 + -BC cells by stabilizing the major endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone HSPA5. Consistently, loss of USP22 renders tumor cells more sensitive to apoptosis and significantly increases the efficiency of therapies targeting the ER folding capacity. Together, our data suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting USP22 activity may sensitize tumor cells to UPR induction and could provide a novel, effective approach to treat HER2 + -BC."
https://openalex.org/W3163687381,"With the change of social economic system and the rapid growth of agricultural economy in China, the amount of agricultural energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions has increased dramatically. Based on the estimation of agricultural carbon dioxide emissions from 1991 to 2018 in China, this paper uses EKC model to analyze economic growth and agricultural carbon dioxide emissions. The Kaya method is used to decompose the factors affecting agricultural carbon dioxide emissions. The experimental results show that there is a co-integration relationship between economic growth and the total intensity of agricultural carbon emissions, and between economic growth and the intensity of carbon emissions caused by five types of carbon sources: fertilizer, pesticide, agricultural film, agricultural diesel oil and tillage. Economic growth is the main driving factor of agricultural carbon dioxide emissions. In addition, technological progress has a strong role in promoting carbon emission reduction, but it has a certain randomness. However, the impact of energy consumption structure and population size on carbon emissions is not obvious."
https://openalex.org/W3161630515,"Climate change is having profound effects on the distributions of species globally. Trait-based assessments predict that specialist and range-restricted species are among those most likely to be at risk of extinction from such changes. Understanding individual species’ responses to climate change is therefore critical for informing conservation planning. We use an established Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) protocol to describe the curious range-restriction of the globally threatened White-tailed Swallow ( Hirundo megaensis ) to a small area in southern Ethiopia. We find that, across a range of modelling approaches, the distribution of this species is well described by two climatic variables, maximum temperature and dry season precipitation. These same two variables have been previously found to limit the distribution of the unrelated but closely sympatric Ethiopian Bush-crow ( Zavattariornis stresemanni ). We project the future climatic suitability for both species under a range of climate scenarios and modelling approaches. Both species are at severe risk of extinction within the next half century, as the climate in 68–84% (for the swallow) and 90–100% (for the bush-crow) of their current ranges is predicted to become unsuitable. Intensive conservation measures, such as assisted migration and captive-breeding, may be the only options available to safeguard these two species. Their projected disappearance in the wild offers an opportunity to test the reliability of SDMs for predicting the fate of wild species. Monitoring future changes in the distribution and abundance of the bush-crow is particularly tractable because its nests are conspicuous and visible over large distances."

All p's < .05.Within African Americans, older, male individuals with lower SES experienced greater racial, lifetime, and multiple social status-based discrimination, but this pattern was not observed in Whites. Among Whites, women reported greater frequency of discrimination across multiple social statuses and other factors (i.e., gender, income, appearance, and health status) than men.

The current study explored the association between physical activity and self-regulation longitudinally and the indirect relationship this may have on academic achievement, using secondary data on primary and secondary school children from the Millennium Cohort Study, a cohort of infants born in 2000-2001 in the United Kingdom. There are two main findings. First, there is a positive link between physical activity and emotional (not behavioural) regulation both concurrently and longitudinally across all three time points, 7-years-old, 11-years-old and 14-years-old. The relationship was negative for emotional regulation and negligible for behavioural regulation when controlling for socioeconomic status. Second, across two time points (due to data availability), physical activity positively predicted academic achievement through emotional regulation for 7-year-olds and behavioural regulation in 11-year-olds. The impact of this relationship was more pronounced when controlling for socioeconomic status. Together these findings indicate that emotional regulation is linked to physical activity in early childhood. Subsequently, emotion regulation predicts academic attainment, suggesting that early interventions might focus on attention rather than behaviour."

This study aimed to investigate the associations between linguistic features in individuals' blog data and their symptoms of depression, generalised anxiety, and suicidal ideation. Individuals who blogged were invited to participate in a longitudinal study in which they completed fortnightly symptom scales for depression and anxiety (PHQ-9, GAD-7) for a period of 36 weeks. Blog data published in the same period was also collected, and linguistic features were analysed using the LIWC tool. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the correlations between the linguistic features and symptoms between subjects. Multivariate regression models were used to predict longitudinal changes in symptoms within subjects. A total of 153 participants consented to the study. The final sample consisted of the 38 participants who completed the required number of symptom scales and generated blog data during the study period. Between-subject analysis revealed that the linguistic features ""tentativeness"" and ""non-fluencies"" were significantly correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, but not suicidal thoughts. Within-subject analysis showed no robust correlations between linguistic features and changes in symptoms. The findings may provide evidence of a relationship between some linguistic features in social media data and mental health; however, the study was limited by missing data and other important considerations. The findings also suggest that linguistic features observed at the group level may not generalise to, or be useful for, detecting individual symptom change over time."
https://openalex.org/W3161130967,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is an inflammatory condition that affects the posterior of the eye; yet, there are limited published data on techniques measuring the expression of growth and inflammatory factors (GIF) from the posterior segment. The purpose of the current study was two-fold: to sample the vitreous fluid from the eyes of patients with DR and assess the expression of GIF. As DR is an inflammatory disease, the second objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the status of DR and the expression of vitreous GIF. This non-randomized clinical trial was approved by BfARM for the analysis and evaluation of 12 eyes from patients with diabetic macular edema. Vitreous sampling was performed before treatment with fluocinolone acetonide and the extracted vitreous material was examined for the determination of GIF including interleukins 6 (IL-6) and 8 (IL-8), interferon gamma-inducible protein (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), placental growth factor (PIGF), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and intercellular adhesion molecule (CD54). These were linearly compared with the grade of inflammation in the vitreous assessed via DR score and ART. Additionally, all eyes were grouped based on their diabetic retinopathy status. All cytokine levels, except MCP-1 and PEDF, were numerically higher in DME patients with proliferative DR than those with non-proliferative DR. DR grade was found to linearly correlate with the expression of CD54 (p = 0.02, rho = 0.64), IL-8 (p = 0.03, rho = 0.64) and PIGF (p = 0.007, rho = 0.76). A correlation was found between ART and CD54 (p = 0.02, rho = 0.66) and also between ART and IL-8 (p = 0.04, rho = 0.60). A trend was found between ART and PIGF (p = 0.08, rho 0.52). For IL-6, there appeared to be a trend with DR grade (p = 0.14, rho = 0.45) and ART (p = 0.09, rho = 0.51). Proliferative DR was shown to be associated with a significant higher expression of CD54, IL-8 and PIGF, thus suggesting that they are potentially important in defining and monitoring the effectiveness of a patients’ therapy. Vitreous probes may be helpful in deciding which therapy to administer (i.e. anti-VEGF or corticosteroid or both) based on the expression of GIF.

https://openalex.org/W3161156483,"This is an epidemiological study on the gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) and Eimeria coccidia infections in Kazakh sheep and the F1 and F2 generations of Kazakh × Texel sheep crosses. A total of 7599 sheep fecal samples were collected from the Zhaosu County and Nilka County in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture in the four seasons-spring, summer, autumn, and winter of 2019. The parasite causing the infection was identified by the saturated saline floating method, and the infection intensity was calculated by the modified McMaster method. SPSS19.0 was used to evaluate the differences in the fecal egg count (FEC) of for GIN and the fecal oocyst count (FOC) value of for coccidia per sample. The results showed that there were nine types of sheep GIN infections and Eimeria coccidia in these two counties of Ililocations, with the dominant parasite species of Haemonchus contortus, Trichostrongylus spp., and Ostertagia spp as the predominant parasites in the sheep. Most of the GIN and coccidia infections in these two regions were mild and moderate. The mean log (FEC) of GIN infection in the Zhaosu area was significantly higher than that in the Nilka area, whereas the mean log (FOC) of coccidia infection in Zhaosu was significantly lower than that of Nilka. The mean log (FEC) of GIN infection in the four seasons was the highest in spring, followed by in summer, then in autumn, and the lowest in winter. The mean log (FOC) of coccidia infection was the highest in spring, followed by in autumn, and was the lowest in summer and winter. The mean log (FEC) of GIN infection and log (FOC) of coccidia infection of Kazakh sheep was significantly higher than the F1 generation, which was then significantly higher than the F2 generation of summer. A positive correlation was found between the EPG and OPG levels in the sheep. These results showed that the GIN and coccidia infection intensities of the F1 generation sheep of Kazakh ×Texel crosses were significantly lower than that of Kazakh sheep paving the way for marker-based resistance selection."
https://openalex.org/W3162134105,"By focusing on high experimental control and realistic presentation, the latest research in expertise assessment of soccer players demonstrates the importance of perceptual skills, especially in decision making. Our work captured omnidirectional in-field scenes displayed through virtual reality glasses to 12 expert players (picked by DFB), 10 regional league intermediate players, and13 novice soccer goalkeepers in order to assess the perceptual skills of athletes in an optimized manner. All scenes were shown from the perspective of the same natural goalkeeper and ended after the return pass to that goalkeeper. Based on the gaze behavior of each player, we classified their expertise with common machine learning techniques. Our results show that eye movements contain highly informative features and thus enable a classification of goalkeepers between three stages of expertise, namely elite youth player, regional league player, and novice, at a high accuracy of 78.2%. This research underscores the importance of eye tracking and machine learning in perceptual expertise research and paves the way for perceptual-cognitive diagnosis as well as future training systems."
https://openalex.org/W3162675866,"Background Granular data related to the likelihood of individuals of different ages accessing acute and critical care services over time is lacking. Methods We used population-based, administrative data from Ontario to identify residents of specific ages (20, 30, 40, etc. to 100) on January 1 st every year from 1995–2019. We assessed rates of emergency department (ED) visits (2003–19), hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions (2003–19), and mechanical ventilation. Findings Overall the 25-year study period, ED were the most common acute healthcare encounter with 100-year-olds having the lowest rate (138.7/1,000) and 90-year-olds the highest (378.5/1,000). Rates of hospitalization ranged from 24.2/1,000 for those age 20 up to 224.9/1,000 for those age 90. Rates of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation were lowest for those age 20 (1.0 and 0.4/1,000), more than tripled by age 50 (3.3 and 1.7/1,000) and peaked at age 80 (20.3 and 10.1/1,000). Over time rates of ED visits increased (164.3 /1,000 in 2003 vs 199.1 /1,000 in 2019) as did rates of invasive mechanical ventilation (2.0/1,000 in 1995 vs 2.9/1,000 in 2019), whereas rates of ICU admission remained stable (4.8/1,000 in 2003 vs 4.9/1,000 in 2019) and hospitalization declined (66.8/1,000 in 1995 vs 51.5/1,000 in 2019). Age stratified analysis demonstrated that rates of ED presentation increased for those age 70 and younger while hospitalization decreased for all age groups; ICU admission and mechanical ventilation rates changed variably by age, with increasing rates demonstrated primarily among people under the age of 50. Interpretation Rates of hospitalizations have decreased over time across all age groups, whereas rates of ED presentation, ICU admissions, and mechanical ventilation have increased, primarily driven by younger adults. These findings suggest that although the delivery of healthcare may be moving away from inpatient medicine, there is a growing population of young adults requiring significant healthcare resources."
https://openalex.org/W3161560259,"Background Despite progress in vaccination coverage, timeliness of childhood vaccination remains a challenge in many settings. We aimed to assess if mobile phone-based reminders and incentives to health workers and caregivers could increase timely neonatal vaccination in a rural, low-resource setting. Methods We conducted an open-label cluster randomized controlled 1:1:1 trial with three arms in 15 communities in Northern Ghana. Communities were randomized to 1) a voice call reminder intervention; 2) a community health volunteer (CHV) intervention with incentivized rewards; 3) control. In the voice call reminder arm, a study staff member made voice calls to mothers shortly after birth to encourage vaccination and provide personalized information about available vaccination services. In the incentive arm, CHVs promoted infant vaccination and informed women with recent births about available vaccination opportunities. Both CHVs and women were provided small monetary incentives for on-time early infant vaccination in this arm, delivered using mobile phone-based banking applications. No study activities were conducted in control communities. A population-based survey compared vaccination coverage across arms in the pre-intervention and intervention periods. The primary endpoint was completion of at least one dose of Polio vaccine within 14 days of life and BCG vaccination within 28 days of life. Results Six-hundred ninety births were identified; 106, 88, and 88 from pre-intervention and 150, 135, and 123 in the intervention period, in the control, voice call reminder and CHV incentive arms, respectively. In adjusted intent-to-treat analysis, voice call reminders were associated with 10.5 percentage point (95% CI: 4.0, 17.1) higher coverage of on-time vaccination, while mobile phone-based incentives were associated with 49.5 percentage point (95% CI: 26.4, 72.5) higher coverage. Conclusion Community-based interventions using mobile phone technologies can improve timely early vaccination coverage. A CHV approach with incentives to community workers and caregivers was a more effective strategy than voice call reminders. The impact of vaccination “nudges” via voice calls may be constrained in settings where network coverage and phone ownership are limited.

https://openalex.org/W3161845404,"Methylation of the HLTF gene in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells occurs more frequently in men than women. Progressive epigenetic silencing of HLTF in tumor cells is accompanied by negligible expression in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Cell line-derived xenografts (CDX) were established in control ( Hltf +/+ ) and Hltf -deleted male Rag2 -/- IL2rg -/- mice by direct orthotopic cell microinjection (OCMI) of HLTF +/+ HCT116 Red-FLuc cells into the submucosa of the cecum. Combinatorial induction of IL6 and S100A8/A9 in the Hltf -deleted TME with ICAM-1 and IL8 in the primary tumor activated a positive feedback loop. The proinflammatory niche produced a major shift in CDX metastasis to peritoneal dissemination compared to controls. Inducible nitric oxide ( iNOS ) gene expression and transactivation of the iNOS-S100A8/A9 signaling complex in Hltf -deleted TME reprogrammed the human S-nitroso-proteome. POTEE, TRIM52 and UN45B were S-nitrosylated on the conserved I/L-X-C-X 2 -D/E motif indicative of iNOS-S100A8/A9-mediated S-nitrosylation. 2D-DIGE and protein identification by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry authenticated S-nitrosylation of 53 individual cysteines in half-site motifs (I/L-X-C or C-X-X-D/E) in CDX tumors. POTEE in CDX tumors is both a general S-nitrosylation target and an iNOS-S100A8/A9 site-specific (Cys 638 ) target in the Hltf -deleted TME. REL is an example of convergence of transcriptomic-S-nitroso-proteomic signaling. The gene is transcriptionally activated in CDX tumors with an Hltf -deleted TME, and REL-SNO (Cys 143 ) was found in primary CDX tumors and all metastatic sites. Primary CDX tumors from Hltf -deleted TME shared 60% of their S-nitroso-proteome with all metastatic sites. Forty percent of SNO-proteins from primary CDX tumors were variably expressed at metastatic sites. Global S-nitrosylation of proteins in pathways related to cytoskeleton and motility was strongly implicated in the metastatic dissemination of CDX tumors. Hltf -deletion from the TME played a major role in the pathogenesis of inflammation and linked protein S-nitrosylation in primary CDX tumors with spatiotemporal continuity in metastatic progression when the tumor cells expressed HLTF."
https://openalex.org/W3161590432,"Because sexual attraction is a key driver of human mate choice and reproduction, we descriptively assess relative sex differences in the level of attraction individuals expect in the aesthetic, resource, and personality characteristics of potential mates. As a novelty we explore how male and female sexual attractiveness preference changes across age, using a dataset comprising online survey data for over 7,000 respondents across a broad age distribution of individuals between 18 and 65 years. In general, we find that both males and females show similar distribution patterns in their preference responses, with statistically significant sex differences within most of the traits. On average, females rate age, education, intelligence, income, trust, and emotional connection around 9 to 14 points higher than males on our 0-100 scale range. Our relative importance analysis shows greater male priority for attractiveness and physical build, compared to females, relative to all other traits. Using multiple regression analysis, we find a consistent statistical sex difference (males relative to females) that decreases linearly with age for aesthetics, while the opposite is true for resources and personality, with females exhibiting a stronger relative preference, particularly in the younger aged cohort. Exploring non-linearity in sex difference with contour plots for intelligence and attractiveness across age (mediated by age) indicates that sex differences in attractiveness preferences are driven by the male cohort (particularly age 30 to 40) for those who care about the importance of age, while intelligence is driven by females caring relatively more about intelligence for those who see age as very important (age cohort 40 to 55). Overall, many of our results indicate distinct variations within sex at key life stages, which is consistent with theories of selection pressure. Moreover, results also align with theories of parental investment, the gender similarities hypothesis, and mutual mate choice-which speaks to the fact that the broader discipline of evolutionary mate choice research in humans still contains considerable scope for further inquiry towards a unified theory, particularly when exploring sex-difference across age."
https://openalex.org/W3162043066,"In the marathon, how runners pace and fuel their race can have a major impact on race outcome. The phenomenon known as hitting the wall (HTW) refers to the iconic hazard of the marathon distance, in which runners experience a significant slowing of pace late in the race, typically after the 20-mile mark, and usually because of a depletion of the body's energy stores.This work investigates the occurrence of significant late-race slowing among recreational marathoners, as a proxy for runners hitting the wall, to better understand the likelihood and nature of such slowdowns, and their effect on race performance.Using pacing data from more than 4 million race records, we develop a pacing-based definition of hitting the wall, by identifying runners who experience a sustained period of slowing during the latter stages of the marathon. We calculate the cost of these slowdowns relative to estimates of the recent personal-best times of runners and compare slowdowns according to runner sex, age, and ability.We find male runners more likely to slow significantly (hit the wall) than female runners; 28% of male runners hit the wall compared with 17% of female runners, χ2(1, N = 1, 928, 813) = 27, 693.35, p < 0.01, OR = 1.43. Such slowdowns are more frequent in the 3 years immediately before and after a recent personal-best (PB) time; for example, 36% of all runners hit the wall in the 3 years before a recent PB compared with just 23% in earlier years, χ2(1, N = 509, 444) = 8, 120.74, p < 0.01, OR = 1.31. When runners hit the wall, males slow more than females: a relative slowdown of 0.40 vs. 0.37 is noted, for male and female runners, when comparing their pace when they hit the wall to their earlier race (5km-20km) pace, with t(475, 199) = 60.19, p < 0.01, d = 0.15. And male runners slow over longer distances than female runners: 10.7km vs. 9.6km, respectively, t(475, 199) = 68.44, p < 0.01, d = 0.17. Although, notably the effect size of these differences is small. We also find the finish-time costs of hitting the wall (lost minutes) to increase with ability; r2(7) = 0.91, p < 0.01 r2(7) = 0.81, p < 0.01 for male and female runners, respectively.While the findings from this study are consistent with qualitative results from earlier single-race or smaller-scale studies, the new insights into the risk and nature of slowdowns, based on the runner sex, age, and ability, have the potential to help runners and coaches to better understand and calibrate the risk/reward trade-offs that exist as they plan for future races."
https://openalex.org/W3162351592,"Introduction Since the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, wearing surgical face masks has become mandatory for healthcare staff in many countries when interacting with patients. Recently, it has been shown that wearing face masks impairs social interaction by diminishing a person’s ability to read the emotion of their counterparts, an essential prerequisite to respond adequately in social situations. It is easily conceivable that this may have a tangible negative influence on the communication and relationship between patients and healthcare personnel. We therefore investigated whether it has an effect on how patients perceive healthcare professionals when physicians and nursing staff wear portrait photos with their smiling faces in addition to face masks. Methods During the study period of 16 days, the medical staff of our Department wore surgical face masks at all times during any kind of interaction with patients. In a pseudorandomized order, all members of our staff additionally affixed their portrait photos to their work clothes on 8 of the 16 days. After completion of their visit, 226 patients were interviewed anonymously in a cross-sectional study design using a questionnaire in which they rated the following three items: friendliness of staff, medical quality of treatment, and how well they felt taken care of during treatment in our Department. Results On days, on which staff wore photos, mean scores of the questionnaires were significantly higher than on non-photo days (p = 0.013; mean ± standard deviation = 92.8 ± 11.3 vs. 91.0 ± 12.6; median (range) = 97 (98) vs. 96 (76)). When analyzed separately, the increased scores were only significant for the item friendliness of staff (p = 0.009; mean ± standard deviation = 95.8 ± 6.3 vs. 92.2 ± 11.5; median (range) = 98 (39) vs. 97 (54)). Conclusion Our study suggests that the use of portrait photos with smiling faces has a positive effect on how patients perceive healthcare staff."
https://openalex.org/W3160797279,"Dam removal is an increasingly important method of stream restoration, but most removal efforts are under-studied in their effects. In order to better understand the effects of such removals on the stream ecosystem, we examined changes in stream macroinvertebrate communities from 2011–2016. Comparisons were focused above, below, and before and after the October 2012 removal of the Brown Bridge Dam on the Boardman River in Michigan (USA), as well as to new channel sites created in its former reservoir (2013–2015). Using linear mixed-effect models on the percent abundance of ecologically sensitive taxa (% Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT)), total density of all macroinvertebrates, overall taxa richness, and Functional Feeding Groups, along with multivariate analyses on the community matrix, we examined differences in community composition among sites and years. EPT declined downstream of the dam immediately after dam removal, but recovered in the second year, becoming dominant within 2–4 years. Downstream sites before removal had different community composition than upstream sites and downstream sites after removal (p&lt;0.001), while upstream and downstream sites after removal converged towards similarity. New channel (restored) %EPT, density, and taxa richness were not different from upstream sites in any year following removal, but new channel sites were the most distinct in community composition, possessing multiple indicator taxa characteristic of unique new conditions. The invasive New Zealand mud snail ( Potamopyrgus antipodarum ) was absent from all sites prior to dam removal, but appeared at low densities in upstream sites in 2013, had spread to all sites by 2015, and showed large increases at all sites by 2016. Managers employing dam removal for stream restoration should include post-removal monitoring for multiple years following removal and conduct risk analysis regarding potential effects on colonization of invasive invertebrate species."
https://openalex.org/W3162764010,"Quantitative evaluation of piano performance is of interests in many fields, including music education and computational performance rendering. Previous studies utilized features extracted from audio or musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) files but did not address the difference between hands (DBH), which might be an important aspect of high-quality performance. Therefore, we investigated DBH as an important factor determining performance proficiency. To this end, 34 experts and 34 amateurs were recruited to play two excerpts on a Yamaha Disklavier. Each performance was recorded in MIDI, and handcrafted features were extracted separately for the right hand (RH) and left hand (LH). These were conventional MIDI features representing temporal and dynamic attributes of each note and computed as absolute values (e. g., MIDI velocity) or ratios between performance and corresponding scores (e. g., ratio of duration or inter-onset interval (IOI)). These note-based features were rearranged into additional features representing DBH by simple subtraction between features of both hands. Statistical analyses showed that DBH was more significant in experts than in amateurs across features. Regarding temporal features, experts pressed keys longer and faster with the RH than did amateurs. Regarding dynamic features, RH exhibited both greater values and a smoother change along melodic intonations in experts that in amateurs. Further experiments using principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector machine (SVM) verified that hand-difference features can successfully differentiate experts from amateurs according to performance proficiency. Moreover, existing note-based raw feature values (Basic features) and DBH features were tested repeatedly via 10-fold cross-validation, suggesting that adding DBH features to Basic features improved F1 scores to 93.6% (by 3.5%) over Basic features. Our results suggest that differently controlling both hands simultaneously is an important skill for pianists; therefore, DBH features should be considered in the quantitative evaluation of piano performance."
https://openalex.org/W3189726472,"Since 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) has moved rapidly across the United States, resulting in tens of thousands of human cases. Both the number of human cases and the minimum infection rate (MIR) in vector mosquitoes vary across time and space and are driven by numerous abiotic and biotic forces, ranging from differences in microclimates to socio-demographic factors. Because the interactions among these multiple factors affect the locally variable risk of WNV illness, it has been especially difficult to model human disease risk across varying spatial and temporal scales. Cook and DuPage Counties, comprising the city of Chicago and surrounding suburbs, experience some of the highest numbers of human neuroinvasive cases of WNV in the United States. Despite active mosquito control efforts, there is consistent annual WNV presence, resulting in more than 285 confirmed WNV human cases and 20 deaths from the years 2014-2018 in Cook County alone.A previous Chicago-area WNV model identified the fifty-five most high and low risk locations in the Northwest Mosquito Abatement District (NWMAD), an enclave ¼ the size of the combined Cook and DuPage county area. In these locations, human WNV risk was stratified by model performance, as indicated by differences in studentized residuals. Within these areas, an additional two-years of field collections and data processing was added to a 12-year WNV dataset that includes human cases, MIR, vector abundance, and land-use, historical climate, and socio-economic and demographic variables, and was assessed by an ultra-fine-scale (1 km spatial x 1 week temporal resolution) multivariate logistic regression model.Multivariate statistical methods applied to the ultra-fine-scale model identified fewer explanatory variables while improving upon the fit of the previous model. Beyond MIR and climatic factors, efforts to acquire additional covariates only slightly improved model predictive performance.These results suggest human WNV illness in the Chicago area may be associated with fewer, but increasingly critical, key variables at finer scales. Given limited resources, these findings suggest large variations in model performance occur, depending on covariate availability, and provide guidance in variable selection for optimal WNV human illness modeling."
https://openalex.org/W3160364545,"From infancy, humans have the ability to distinguish animate agents from inert objects, and preschoolers map biological and mechanical insides to their appropriate kinds. However, less is known about how identifying something as an animate agent shapes specific inferences about its internal properties. Here, we test whether preschool children (N = 92; North American population) have specifically biological expectations about animate agents, or if they have more general expectations that animate agents should have an internal source of motion. We presented preschoolers with videos of two puppets: a ""self-propelled"" fur-covered puppet, and a fur-covered puppet that is seen to be moved by a human actor. In addition, we presented preschoolers with images of a familiar artifact (motorcycle) and familiar animal (sheep). For each item, we asked them to choose what they thought was inside each of these entities: nothing, biological insides, or mechanical insides. Preschoolers were less likely to say that a self-propelled fur-covered object was empty, compared to a fur-covered object that was moved by a human actor, which converges with past work with infants. However, preschoolers showed no specifically biological expectations about these objects, despite being able to accurately match biological insides to familiar animals and mechanical insides to familiar artifacts on the follow-up measure. These results suggest that preschoolers do not have specifically biological expectations about animate agents as a category, but rather general expectations that such agents should not be empty inside."
https://openalex.org/W3162077463,"We have previously shown that leucine deprivation stimulates browning and lipolysis in white adipose tissue (WAT), which helps to treat obesity. Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) significantly influence WAT browning and lipolysis. However, it is unclear whether ATMs are involved in leucine deprivation-induced browning and lipolysis in WAT; the associated signals remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of ATMs and the possible mechanisms involved in WAT browning and lipolysis under leucine-deprivation conditions. In this study, macrophages were depleted in mice by injecting clodronate-liposomes (CLOD) into subcutaneous white adipose tissues. Then, mice lacking general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2), which is a sensor of amino acid starvation, specifically in Lyz2-expressing cells, were generated to investigate the changes in leucine deprivation-induced WAT browning and lipolysis. We found leucine deprivation decreased the accumulation and changed the polarization of ATMs. Ablation of macrophages by CLOD impaired WAT browning and lipolysis under leucine-deprivation conditions. Mechanistically, leucine deprivation activated GCN2 signals in macrophages. Myeloid-specific abrogation of GCN2 in mice blocked leucine deprivation-induced browning and lipolysis in WAT. Further analyses revealed that GCN2 activation in macrophages reduced the expression of monoamine oxidase A (MAOA), resulting in increased norepinephrine (NE) secretion from macrophages to adipocytes, and this resulted in enhanced WAT browning and lipolysis. Moreover, the injection of CL316,243, a β3-adrenergic receptor agonist, and inhibition of MAOA effectively increased the level of NE, leading to the enhancement of browning and lipolysis of WAT in myeloid GCN2 knockout mice under leucine deprivation. Collectively, our results demonstrate a novel function of GCN2 signals in macrophages, that is, regulating WAT browning and lipolysis under leucine deprivation. Our study provides important hints for possible treatment for obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3161111963,"This study aimed to evaluate improvement of tongue-palatal contact patterns during swallowing after orthognathic surgery in mandibular prognathism patients. Thirty patients with mandibular prognathism treated by orthognathic surgery (average age of 27 years, 3 months) and 10 controls (average age 29 years, 6 months) participated in this study. Tongue-palatal contact patterns of patients before and three months after surgery were evaluated by electropalatography (EPG) as well as controls. Whole total of tongue-palatal contact at 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 sec before complete tongue-palatal contact during swallowing were evaluated. The duration of swallowing phases was also examined. Complete contact of tongue-tip in the alveolar part of individual artificial EPG plate were shown at 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1 sec before complete tongue-palatal contact in the controls, although incomplete contact in the alveolar part were shown at 0.3 sec in mandibular prognathism patients. Whole total of tongue-palatal contact at 0.3 and 0.2 sec before complete tongue-palatal contact was significantly lower in the patients before surgery than in the controls (p<0.05). However, these values increased after surgery. The duration of oral and pharyngeal phase was significantly longer in the patients before surgery than in the controls and the patients after surgery (p<0.01). This study demonstrated that the tongue-palatal contact pattern improved and the duration of oral and pharyngeal phase was shortened in mandibular prognathism patients during swallowing after orthognathic surgery. It is suggested that changes in maxillofacial morphology by orthognathic surgery can induce normal tongue movement during swallowing.

https://openalex.org/W3161220067,"We describe the first reported intergeneric, which naturally occurs between two subspecies belonging to different genera, Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. sooana (genus Dactylorhiza ) and Pseudorchis albida subsp. tricuspis (genus Pseudorchis ), as × Pseudorhiza nieschalkii (Senghas) P.F.Hunt nothosubsp. siculorum H.Kertész &amp; N.Anghelescu, 2020. The hybrid was found and digitally photographed for the first time by Hajnalka Kertész in June, 2020, within Terra Siculorum, in one of the Natura 2000 protected areas, known as Harghita Mădăraș, ROSCI00090. Following detailed morphometric analysis using 67 characters and molecular karyological analyses, we identified this unique specimen as an intergeneric hybrid, new to science. The hybrid, an F 1 generation plant, most likely representing a single intergeneric pollination event, is phenotypically intermediate between its parental species in most of the characters scored, but it significantly closely resembles Pseudorchis albida subsp. tricuspis parent. Since several individuals of the parental species occurred in near proximity, within 1–10 meters distance, we suggest that the production of this hybrid required a minimum travel distance of ca 1–10 meters, by the pollinators and frequent exchange of pollen between the parental species was very likely. The parental species and the hybrid, which display a considerable synchronicity in their flowering time, overlap in the pollinator community, sharing various species of Hymenopterans and Dipterans, very abundant in the heathland. This Terra Siculorum hybrid is thus best described as a rarely occurring intergeneric hybrid that shows strong Pseudorchis albida subsp. tricuspis parental dominance in inheritance patterns."
https://openalex.org/W3162611415,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), an arbovirus belonging to the Phlebovirus genus of the Phenuiviridae family, causes the zoonotic and mosquito-borne RVF. The virus, which primarily affects livestock (ruminants and camels) and humans, is at the origin of recent major outbreaks across the African continent (Mauritania, Libya, Sudan), and in the South-Western Indian Ocean (SWIO) islands (Mayotte). In order to be better prepared for upcoming outbreaks, to predict its introduction in RVFV unscathed countries, and to run efficient surveillance programmes, the priority is harmonising and improving the diagnostic capacity of endemic countries and/or countries considered to be at risk of RVF. A serological inter-laboratory proficiency test (PT) was implemented to assess the capacity of veterinary laboratories to detect antibodies against RVFV. A total of 18 laboratories in 13 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, South Africa, and the Indian Ocean participated in the initiative. Two commercial kits and two in-house serological assays for the detection of RVFV specific IgG antibodies were tested. Sixteen of the 18 participating laboratories (88.9%) used commercial kits, the analytical performance of test sensitivity and specificity based on the seroneutralisation test considered as the reference was 100%. The results obtained by the laboratories which used the in-house assay were correct in only one of the two criteria (either sensitivity or specificity). In conclusion, most of the laboratories performed well in detecting RVFV specific IgG antibodies and can therefore be considered to be prepared. Three laboratories in three countries need to improve their detection capacities. Our study demonstrates the importance of conducting regular proficiency tests to evaluate the level of preparedness of countries and of building a network of competent laboratories in terms of laboratory diagnosis to better face future emerging diseases in emergency conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3162707028,"Effective and timely disease surveillance systems have the potential to help public health officials design interventions to mitigate the effects of disease outbreaks. Currently, healthcare-based disease monitoring systems in France offer influenza activity information that lags real-time by one to three weeks. This temporal data gap introduces uncertainty that prevents public health officials from having a timely perspective on the population-level disease activity. Here, we present a machine-learning modeling approach that produces real-time estimates and short-term forecasts of influenza activity for the twelve continental regions of France by leveraging multiple disparate data sources that include, Google search activity, real-time and local weather information, flu-related Twitter micro-blogs, electronic health records data, and historical disease activity synchronicities across regions. Our results show that all data sources contribute to improving influenza surveillance and that machine-learning ensembles that combine all data sources lead to accurate and timely predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3163934828,"Several past studies indicated that religious beliefs, orientation, and practice are protective of suicide. Findings from recent studies in China suggest that religiosity may contribute to increased suicidality. However, few studies have examined the associations between religious affiliation across different faiths and suicidality in China.The current study examines the association between religious affiliation and suicidality among college students in six provinces in China.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 11,407 college students from six universities in Ningxia, Shandong, Shanghai, Jilin, Qinghai, and Shaanxi. We collected the data between October 2017 and March 2018 using self-report questionnaires. They included self-report measures of depression, psychache, hopelessness, self-esteem, social support, and life purpose.Participants with a Christian affiliation had 1.5 times (95% CI: 1.14, 1.99, p = 0.004) higher odds of indicating an elevated suicide risk, 3.1 times (95% CI: 1.90, 5.04, p<0.001) higher odds of indicating a previous suicide attempt, and increased overall suicidality (B = 0.105, p < 0.001) after accounting for demographic and risk/protective factors. Christians also scored the highest in depression, psychache, hopelessness, and the lowest social support, self-esteem, and purpose in life. Muslims reported decreased suicidality (B = -0.034, p = 0.031). Buddhism/Daoism yielded non-significant results in the multivariate analyses.Christian college students reported increased suicidality levels, perhaps due to public policies on religion. The decreased suicidality levels among Muslims may be attributed to higher perceived social support. The associations between religious affiliation and suicidality, depression, and hopelessness contrast sharply with US samples. This finding may be influenced by interactions between the religious denomination, individual, and social/political factors. This conclusion includes the possibility of anti-religious discrimination, which this paper did not investigate as a possible mediator and therefore remains a conjecture worthy of future investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3162285048,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory rheumatic disease, mediated in part by TNFα and associated with bone loss. Anti-TNFα treatment should inhibit this phenomenon and reduce the systemic bone loss. Ultra-high field MRI (UHF MRI) may be used to quantify bone microarchitecture (BM) in-vivo. In this study, we quantified BM using UHF MRI in a PsA patient and followed up the changes related to anti-TNFα treatment.A non-treated PsA patient with knee arthritis and 7 gender-matched controls were scanned using a gradient re-echo sequence at UHF MRI. After a year of Adalimumab treatment, the patient underwent a second UHF MRI. A PET-FNa imaging was performed before and after treatment to identify and localize the abnormal metabolic areas. BM was characterized using typical morphological parameters quantified in 32 regions of interest (ROIs) located in the patella, proximal tibia, and distal femur.Before treatment, the BM parameters were statistically different from controls in 24/32 ROIs with differences reaching up to 38%. After treatment, BM parameters were normalized for 15 out of 24 ROIs. The hypermetabolic areas disclosed by PET-FNa before the treatment partly resumed after the treatment.Thanks to UHF MRI, we quantified in vivo BM anomalies in a PsA patient and we illustrated a major reversion after one year of treatment. Moreover, BM results highlighted that the abnormalities were not only localized in hypermetabolic regions identified by PET-FNa, suggesting that the bone loss was global and not related to inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3162434880,"To determine the intrinsic role of Orai1 in osteoclast development, Orai1-floxed mice were bred with LysMcre mice to delete Orai1 from the myeloid lineage. PCR, in situ labelling and Western analysis showed Orai1 deletion in myeloid-lineage cells, including osteoclasts, as expected. Surprisingly, bone resorption was maintained in vivo, despite loss of multinucleated osteoclasts; instead, a large number of mononuclear cells bearing tartrate resistant acid phosphatase were observed on cell surfaces. An in vitro resorption assay confirmed that RANKL-treated Orai1 null cells, also TRAP-positive but mononuclear, degraded matrix, albeit at a reduced rate compared to wild type osteoclasts. This shows that mononuclear osteoclasts can degrade bone, albeit less efficiently. Further unexpected findings included that Orai1fl/fl -LysMcre vertebrae showed slightly reduced bone density in 16-week-old mice, despite Orai1 deletion only in myeloid cells; however, this mild difference resolved with age. In summary, in vitro analysis showed a severe defect in osteoclast multinucleation in Orai1 negative mononuclear cells, consistent with prior studies using less targeted strategies, but with evidence of resorption in vivo and unexpected secondary effects on bone formation leaving bone mass largely unaffected."
https://openalex.org/W3021736008,"We examine crime patterns in Santa Monica, California before and after passage of Proposition 47, a 2014 initiative that reclassified some non-violent felonies to misdemeanors. We also study how the 2016 opening of four new light rail stations, and how more community-based policing starting in late 2018, impacted crime. A series of statistical analyses are performed on reclassified (larceny, fraud, possession of narcotics, forgery, receiving/possessing stolen property) and non-reclassified crimes by probing publicly available databases from 2006 to 2019. We compare data before and after passage of Proposition 47, city-wide and within eight neighborhoods. Similar analyses are conducted within a 450 meter radius of the new transit stations. Reports of monthly reclassified crimes increased city-wide by approximately 15% after enactment of Proposition 47, with a significant drop observed in late 2018. Downtown exhibited the largest overall surge. The reported incidence of larceny intensified throughout the city. Two new train stations, including Downtown, reported significant crime increases in their vicinity after service began. While the number of reported reclassified crimes increased after passage of Proposition 47, those not affected by the new law decreased or stayed constant, suggesting that Proposition 47 strongly impacted crime in Santa Monica. Reported crimes decreased in late 2018 concurrent with the adoption of new policing measures that enhanced outreach and patrolling. These findings may be relevant to law enforcement and policy-makers. Follow-up studies needed to confirm long-term trends may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic that drastically changed societal conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3161505305,"Baroreflex dysfunction is partly implicated in hypertension and one responsible region is the dorsal medulla oblongata including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). NTS neurons receive and project glutamatergic inputs to subsequently regulate blood pressure, while G-protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play a modulatory role for glutamatergic transmission in baroreflex pathways. Stimulating group II mGluR subtype 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) in the brainstem can decrease blood pressure and sympathetic nervous activity. Here, we hypothesized that the chronic stimulation of mGluR2/3 in the dorsal medulla oblongata can alleviate hypertensive development via the modulation of autonomic nervous activity in young, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Compared with that in the sham control group, chronic LY379268 application (mGluR2/3 agonist; 0.40 μg/day) to the dorsal medulla oblongata for 6 weeks reduced the progression of hypertension in 6-week-old SHRs as indicated by the 40 mmHg reduction in systolic blood pressure and promoted their parasympathetic nervous activity as evidenced by the heart rate variability. No differences in blood catecholamine levels or any echocardiographic indices were found between the two groups. The improvement of reflex bradycardia, a baroreflex function, appeared after chronic LY379268 application. The mRNA expression level of mGluR2, but not mGluR3, in the dorsal medulla oblongata was substantially reduced in SHRs compared to that of the control strain. In conclusion, mGluR2/3 signaling might be responsible for hypertension development in SHRs, and modulating mGluR2/3 expression/stimulation in the dorsal brainstem could be a novel therapeutic strategy for hypertension via increasing the parasympathetic activity."
https://openalex.org/W3162327270,"Purpose The objective of the investigation was to determine the concomitant effects of upper arm blood flow restriction (BFR) and inversion on elbow flexors neuromuscular responses. Methods Randomly allocated, 13 volunteers performed four conditions in a within-subject design: rest (control, 1-min upright position without BFR), control (1-min upright with BFR), 1-min inverted (without BFR), and 1-min inverted with BFR. Evoked and voluntary contractile properties, before, during and after a 30-s maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) exercise intervention were examined as well as pain scale. Results Inversion induced significant pre-exercise intervention decreases in elbow flexors MVC (21.1%, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M1""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = 0.48, p = 0.02) and resting evoked twitch forces (29.4%, <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M2""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = 0.34, p = 0.03). The 30-s MVC induced significantly greater pre- to post-test decreases in potentiated twitch force ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M3""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = 0.61, p = 0.0009) during inversion (↓75%) than upright (↓65.3%) conditions. Overall, BFR decreased MVC force 4.8% ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M4""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = 0.37, p = 0.05). For upright position, BFR induced 21.0% reductions in M-wave amplitude ( <mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"" display=""inline"" id=""M5""><mml:msubsup><mml:mi mathvariant=""normal"">η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math> = 0.44, p = 0.04). There were no significant differences for electromyographic activity or voluntary activation as measured with the interpolated twitch technique. For all conditions, there was a significant increase in pain scale between the 40–60 s intervals and post-30-s MVC (upright&lt;inversion, and without BFR&lt;BFR). Conclusion The concomitant application of inversion with elbow flexors BFR only amplified neuromuscular performance impairments to a small degree. Individuals who execute forceful contractions when inverted or with BFR should be cognizant that force output may be impaired."
https://openalex.org/W3162705026,"Patients with inactive acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) are at high risk for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HPSCC). The acetaldehyde breath test (ABT) may demonstrate ALDH2 gene polymorphisms. We evaluated the usefulness of the ABT in patients with ESCC and HPSCC. The squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) group consisted of 100 patients who were treated with endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for ESCC or HPSCC, and the control group (HC) consisted of 275 healthy subjects. The SCC group comprised the ""single subgroup"" (n = 63), in which a single lesion was initially treated with ESD, and the ""multiple subgroup"" (n = 31), in which multiple lesions were initially treated with ESD. First, we compared the groups' risk factors for carcinogenesis and measured the acetaldehyde-to-ethanol (A/E) ratio. Then we tested the groups' differences in the abovementioned carcinogenic risk factors. We found that the proportion of individuals in the SCC group with inactive ALDH2 (A/E ratio ≥ 23.3) was significantly higher than that in the HC group (p = 0.035), as was the A/E ratio (p < 0.001). Also, the proportion of individuals with inactive ALDH2 in the multiple subgroup was significantly higher than that in single subgroup (p = 0.015), as was the A/E ratio (p = 0.008). In conclusion, ABT may be a potential screening tool for detecting people at risk of ESCC and HPSCC. In addition, it could be a useful tool in detecting patients at risk of multiple or double carcinomas among patients with ESCC and HPSCC.

https://openalex.org/W3163271315,"With the recent advent of genetic engineering, numerous genetically modified (GM) crops have been developed, and field planting has been initiated. In open-environment cultivation, the cross-pollination (CP) of GM crops with wild relatives, conventional crops, and organic crops can occur. This exchange of genetic material results in the gene flow phenomenon. Consequently, studies of gene flow among GM crops have primarily focused on the extent of CP between the pollen source plot and the adjacent recipient field. In the present study, Black Pearl Waxy Corn (a variety of purple glutinous maize) was used to simulate a GM-maize pollen source. The pollen recipient was Tainan No. 23 Corn (a variety of white glutinous maize). The CP rate (%) was calculated according to the xenia effect on kernel color. We assessed the suitability of common empirical models of pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) for GM maize, and the field border (FB) effect of the model was considered for small-scale farming systems in Asia. Field-scale data were used to construct an optimal model for maize PMGF in the maize-producing areas of Chiayi County, southern Taiwan (R.O.C). Moreover, each model was verified through simulation and by using the 95% percentile bootstrap confidence interval length. According to the results, a model incorporating both the distance from the source and the FB can have optimal fitting and predictive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W3161932290,"To measure the effects of air pollution on human activities, this study applies statistical/econometric modeling to hourly data of 9 million mobile phone users from six cities in China's Zhejiang Province from December 18 to 21, 2013. Under a change in air quality from ""Good"" (Air Quality Index, or AQI, between 51 and 100) to ""Heavily Polluted"" (AQI between 201 to 300), the following effects are demonstrated. (i) Consistent with the literature, for every one million people, 1, 482 fewer individuals are observed at parks, 95% confidence interval or CI (-2, 229, -735), which represents a 15% decrease. (ii) The number of individuals at shopping malls has no statistically significant change. (iii) Home is the most important location under worsening air quality, and for every one million people, 63, 088 more individuals are observed at home, 95% CI (47, 815, 78, 361), which represents a 19% increase. (iv) Individuals are on average 633 meters closer to their home, 95% CI (529, 737); as a benchmark, the median distance from home ranges from 300 to 1900 meters across the cities in our sample. These effects are not due to weather or government regulations. We also provided provisional evidence that individuals engage in inter-temporal activity substitutions within a day, which leads to mitigated (but not nullified) effects of air pollution on daily activities."
https://openalex.org/W3163104143,"Postoperative early oral nutrition has increasingly been adopted for patients undergoing gastrectomy. However, intolerability to early oral nutrition remains a major concern, especially in older patients. This study aimed to investigate early oral nutrition intolerability in older patients who had undergone gastrectomy.We retrospectively reviewed 825 patients who had undergone gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma between 2017 and 2019. All patients received an oral diet on postoperative day 1. Patients were divided into older (≥70 years) and younger (<70 years) adult groups, and short-term outcomes and intolerability to oral nutrition were compared. Intolerability to early oral nutrition was defined as oral diet cessation due to adverse gastrointestinal symptoms.Among the 825 patients (≥70 years, n = 286; <70 years, n = 539), 151 (18.3%) developed intolerability to early oral nutrition, of whom 100 patients were < 70 years old and 51 were ≥70 years old. The most common symptom causing intolerability was abdominal distension. The mean duration of fasting after developing intolerability was 2.8 ± 2.4 days. The incidence of intolerability in the older and younger adult groups was 17.8% and 18.6%, respectively (p = 0.799). In terms of sex, operative approach, gastric resection, lymph node dissection, reconstruction, and tumor stage subgroups, the older adult group did not exhibit a significant increase in intolerability. Postoperatively, the older adult group showed a higher incidence of systemic complications; however, anastomotic complications did not significantly differ between the two groups.Postoperative early oral nutrition can safely be adopted for older patients undergoing gastrectomy, with acceptable intolerability and surgical outcomes."
