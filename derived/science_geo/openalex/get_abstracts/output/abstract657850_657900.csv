https://openalex.org/W3049406819,"Efficient strategies to contain the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are peremptory to relieve the negatively impacted public health and global economy, with the full scope yet to unfold. In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities. As such, our model warrants further validation studies."
https://openalex.org/W3049763962,"Objective Serological testing is needed to investigate the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from front-line essential workers to their household members. However, the requirement for serum/plasma limits serological testing to clinical settings where it is feasible to collect and process venous blood. To address this problem we developed a serological test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies that requires only a single drop of finger stick capillary whole blood, collected in the home and dried on filter paper (dried blood spot, DBS). We describe assay performance and demonstrate its utility for remote sampling with results from a community-based study. Methods An ELISA to the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was optimized to quantify IgG antibodies in DBS. Samples were self-collected from a community sample of 232 participants enriched with health care workers, including 30 known COVID-19 cases and their household members. Results Among 30 individuals sharing a household with a virus-confirmed case of COVID-19, 80% were seropositive. Of 202 community individuals without prior confirmed acute COVID-19 diagnoses, 36% were seropositive. Of documented convalescent COVID-19 cases from the community, 29 of 30 (97%) were seropositive for IgG antibodies to the receptor binding domain. Conclusion DBS ELISA provides a minimally-invasive alternative to venous blood collection. Early analysis suggests a high rate of transmission among household members. High rates of seroconversion were also noted following recovery from infection. Serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in DBS samples can facilitate seroprevalence assessment in community settings to address epidemiological questions, monitor duration of antibody responses, and assess if antibodies against the spike protein correlate with protection from reinfection."

The biomass of two varieties of Saussurea costus (Qustal hindi and Qustal bahri) were used in the green synthesis of MgONPs. The physical and chemical features of nanoparticles were confirmed by spectroscopic and microscopic techniques. The surface morphology of the obtained nanoparticles was detected at different magnifications by SEM and TEM microscopy and the size of nanoparticles were found to be 30 and 34 nm for Qustal hindi and Qustal bahri, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of the prepared MgONPs was screened against six pathogenic strains. The synthesized nanoparticles by Qustal bahri biomass exerted significant inhibition zones 15, 16, 18, 17, 14, and 10 mm against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, C. tropicalis and C. glabrata, S. aureus and B. subtilis as compared to those from Qustal hindi 12, 8 and 17 mm against B. subtilis, E. coli and C. tropicalis, respectively. MgONPs showed a potential cytotoxicity effect against MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. Cellular investigations of MgONPs revealed that the prepared nanoparticles by Qustal bahri exhibited high cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cancer cell lines. IC50 values in MCF-7 cells were found to be 67.3% and 52.1% for MgONPs of Saussurea costus biomasses, respectively. Also, the photocatalytic activity of MgONPs of each Saussurea costus variety was comparatively studied. They exhibited an enhanced photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue after UV irradiation for 1 h as 92% and 59% for those prepared by Qustal bahri and Qustal hindi, respectively. Outcome of results revealed that the biosynthesized MgONPs showed promising biomedical potentials."
https://openalex.org/W3049521066,"Bone metastasis is one of the most frequent diseases in prostate cancer; scintigraphy imaging is particularly important for the clinical diagnosis of bone metastasis. Up to date, minimal research has been conducted regarding the application of machine learning with emphasis on modern efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) algorithms, for the diagnosis of prostate cancer metastasis from bone scintigraphy images. The advantageous and outstanding capabilities of deep learning, machine learning's groundbreaking technological advancement, have not yet been fully investigated regarding their application in computer-aided diagnosis systems in the field of medical image analysis, such as the problem of bone metastasis classification in whole-body scans. In particular, CNNs are gaining great attention due to their ability to recognize complex visual patterns, in the same way as human perception operates. Considering all these new enhancements in the field of deep learning, a set of simpler, faster and more accurate CNN architectures, designed for classification of metastatic prostate cancer in bones, is explored. This research study has a two-fold goal: to create and also demonstrate a set of simple but robust CNN models for automatic classification of whole-body scans in two categories, malignant (bone metastasis) or healthy, using solely the scans at the input level. Through a meticulous exploration of CNN hyper-parameter selection and fine-tuning, the best architecture is selected with respect to classification accuracy. Thus a CNN model with improved classification capabilities for bone metastasis diagnosis is produced, using bone scans from prostate cancer patients. The achieved classification testing accuracy is 97.38%, whereas the average sensitivity is approximately 95.8%. Finally, the best-performing CNN method is compared to other popular and well-known CNN architectures used for medical imaging, like VGG16, ResNet50, GoogleNet and MobileNet. The classification results show that the proposed CNN-based approach outperforms the popular CNN methods in nuclear medicine for metastatic prostate cancer diagnosis in bones."
https://openalex.org/W3049013229,"The role of white matter in reading has been established by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), but DTI cannot identify specific microstructural features driving these relationships. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) and multicomponent driven equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1/T2 (mcDESPOT) can be used to link more specific aspects of white matter microstructure and reading due to their sensitivity to axonal packing and fiber coherence (NODDI) and myelin (ihMT and mcDESPOT). We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to combine DTI, NODDI, ihMT and mcDESPOT measures (10 in total), identify major features of white matter structure, and link these features to both reading and age. Analysis was performed for nine reading-related tracts in 46 neurotypical 6-16 year olds. We identified three principal components (PCs) which explained 79.5% of variance in our dataset. PC1 probed tissue complexity, PC2 described myelin and axonal packing, while PC3 was related to axonal diameter. Mixed effects regression models did not identify any significant relationships between principal components and reading skill. Bayes factor analysis revealed that the absence of relationships was not due to low power. Increasing PC1 in the left arcuate fasciculus with age suggest increases in tissue complexity, while increases of PC2 in the bilateral arcuate, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, and splenium suggest increases in myelin and axonal packing with age. Multimodal white matter imaging and PCA provide microstructurally informative, powerful principal components which can be used by future studies of development and cognition. Our findings suggest major features of white matter undergo development during childhood and adolescence, but changes are not linked to reading during this period in our typically-developing sample."

https://openalex.org/W3049053171,"The use and management of single use plastics is a major area of concern for the public, regulatory and business worlds. Focusing on the most commonly occurring consumer plastic items present in European freshwater environments, we identified and evaluated consumer-based actions with respect to their direct or indirect potential to reduce macroplastic pollution in freshwater environments. As the main end users of these items, concerned consumers are faced with a bewildering array of choices to reduce their plastics footprint, notably through recycling or using reusable items. Using a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis approach, we explored the effectiveness of 27 plastic reduction actions with respect to their feasibility, economic impacts, environmental impacts, unintended social/environmental impacts, potential scale of change and evidence of impact. The top ranked consumer-based actions were identified as: using wooden or reusable cutlery; switching to reusable water bottles; using wooden or reusable stirrers; using plastic free cotton-buds; and using refill detergent/ shampoo bottles. We examined the feasibility of top-ranked actions using a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) to explore the complexities inherent in their implementation for consumers, businesses, and government to reduce the presence of plastic in the environment."
https://openalex.org/W3049425842,"Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are the leading causes of neonatal and child mortality. Despite several national efforts to reduce the incidence of mortality among children, India is one of the largest contributors to under-five mortality in the world. In this study, we examined the effects of indoor pollution on ARI among under-five children in India.A cross-sectional study was carried using nationally representative data from the 2015-2016 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). This study is based on 247,743 living children under the age of five years. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the impact of indoor air pollution on children's ARI.Almost two-thirds of households (65.2%) used biomass fuels for cooking, 54.9% of households had a separate kitchen, and 47.2% of households had a smoker. About 2.7% of children suffered from ARI in the past two weeks preceding the survey. The use of biomass fuels (OR [odds ratio]: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), households having no separate kitchen (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.14-1.30), and smoking behavior of household members (OR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.00-1.12) were associated with greater risk of ARI among under-five children even after adjusting for age of child, sex of child, birth order, maternal age, maternal education, caste, religion, wealth quintile, any HH members suffer from tuberculosis (TB), and household crowding. Furthermore, the results revealed that the combined effects of biomass fuels and households without separate kitchen increased the likelihood of children's ARI by 36% (Adjusted OR: 1.35, 95% CI: 1.21-1.51).The findings of this study suggest policy interventions to reduce the exposure of indoor air pollution, particularly among the impoverished groups. The government should ensure cleaner fuels for cooking, such as LPG and electricity, to minimize the risk of respiratory diseases among children."
https://openalex.org/W3049320235,"Data prioritization of heterogeneous data in wireless sensor networks gives meaning to mission-critical data that are time-sensitive as this may be a matter of life and death. However, the standard IEEE 802.15.4 does not consider the prioritization of data. Prioritization schemes proffered in the literature have not adequately addressed this issue as proposed schemes either uses a single or complex backoff algorithm to estimate backoff time-slots for prioritized data. Subsequently, the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance scheme exhibits an exponentially increasing range of backoff times. These approaches are not only inefficient but result in high latency and increased power consumption. In this article, the concept of class of service (CS) was adopted to prioritize heterogeneous data (real-time and non-real-time), resulting in an optimized prioritized backoff MAC scheme called Class of Service Traffic Priority-based Medium Access Control (CSTP-MAC). This scheme classifies data into high priority data (HPD) and low priority data (LPD) by computing backoff times with expressions peculiar to the data priority class. The improved scheme grants nodes the opportunity to access the shared medium in a timely and power-efficient manner. Benchmarked against contemporary schemes, CSTP-MAC attained a 99% packet delivery ratio with improved power saving capability, which translates to a longer operational lifetime."
https://openalex.org/W3049657557,"The reconstruction and application of genome-scale metabolic network models is a central topic in the field of systems biology with numerous applications in biotechnology, ecology, and medicine. However, there is no agreed upon standard for the definition of the nutritional environment for these models. The objective of this article is to provide a guideline and a clear paradigm on how to translate nutritional information into an in-silico representation of the chemical environment. Step-by-step procedures explain how to characterise and categorise the nutritional input and to successfully apply it to constraint-based metabolic models. In parallel, we illustrate the proposed procedure with a case study of the growth of Escherichia coli in a complex nutritional medium and show that an accurate representation of the medium is crucial for physiological predictions. The proposed framework will assist researchers to expand their existing metabolic models of their microbial systems of interest with detailed representations of the nutritional environment, which allows more accurate and reproducible predictions of microbial metabolic processes."

https://openalex.org/W3049072483,"As part of a partnership between the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health, woreda-based quality improvement collaboratives took place between November 2016 and December 2017 aiming to accelerate reduction of maternal and neonatal mortality in Lemu Bilbilu, Tanqua Abergele and Duguna Fango woredas. Before starting the collaboratives, assessments found inaccuracies in core measures obtained from Health Management Information System reports.Building on the quality improvement collaborative design, data quality improvement activities were added and we used the World Health Organization review methodology to drive a verification factor for the core measures of number of pregnant women that received their first antenatal care visit, number of pregnant women that received antenatal care on at least four visits, number of pregnant women tested for syphilis and number of births attended by skilled health personnel. Impact of the data quality improvement was assessed using interrupted time series analysis. We found accurate data across all time periods for Tanqua Abergele. In Lemu Bilbilu and Duguna Fango, data quality improved for all core metrics over time. In Duguna Fango, the verification factor for number of pregnant women that received their first antenatal care visit improved from 0.794 (95%CI 0.753, 0.836; p<0.001) pre-intervention by 0.173 (95%CI 0.128, 0.219; p<0.001) during the collaborative; and the verification factor for number of pregnant women tested for syphilis improved from 0.472 (95%CI 0.390, 0.554; p<0.001) pre-intervention by 0.460 (95%CI 0.369, 0.552; p<0.001) during the collaborative. In Lemu Bilbilu, the verification factor for number of pregnant women receiving a fourth antenatal visit rose from 0.589 (95%CI 0.513, 0.664; p<0.001) at baseline by 0.358 (95%CI 0.258, 0.458; p<0.001) post-intervention; and skilled birth attendance rose from 0.917 (95%CI 0.869, 0.965) at baseline by 0.083 (95%CI 0.030, 0.136; p<0.001) during the collaborative.A Data quality improvement initiative embedded within woreda clinical improvement collaborative improved accuracy of data used to monitor maternal and newborn health services in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3048445447,"Tripartite motif-containing protein 21 (TRIM21) is a cytosolic antibody receptor that targets the internalized virus-antibody complex to the proteasome for degradation. However, the precise mechanism regulating TRIM21 activity is unknown. Here we show that TRIM21 is a substrate of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) and that its function is regulated by acetylation. HDAC6 interacts with TRIM21 through its PRYSPRY motif and deacetylates TRIM21 at lysine 385 and lysine 387, thus promoting its homodimerization. Inhibiting HDAC6 activity increases TRIM21 acetylation, and hyperacetylation blocks TRIM21 dimerization and ubiquitination, preventing its binding to the virus-antibody complex and its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. HDAC6 depletion or inhibition increases virus accumulation in cells, indicative of an impaired capacity for antibody-dependent intracellular neutralization of viruses, whereas TRIM21 acetylation-deficient K385/387R mutant rescues HDAC6 depletion-caused ADIN impairment. These findings provide evidence for HDAC6 as a novel regulator of TRIM21-mediated intracellular innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3049403055,"Background Up to 50% of ischemic strokes in the young after thorough diagnostic work-up remain cryptogenic or associated with low-risk sources of cardioembolism such as patent foramen ovale (PFO). We studied with cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, whether left ventricular (LV) non-compaction—a possible source for embolic stroke due to sluggish blood flow in deep intertrabecular recesses—is associated with cryptogenic strokes in the young. Methods Searching for Explanations for Cryptogenic Stroke in the Young: Revealing the Etiology, Triggers, and Outcome (SECRETO; NCT01934725) is an international prospective multicenter case-control study of young adults (aged 18–49 years) presenting with an imaging-positive first-ever ischemic stroke of undetermined etiology. In this pilot substudy, 30 cases and 30 age- and sex-matched stroke-free controls were examined with CMR. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) bubble test was performed to evaluate the presence and magnitude of right-to-left shunt (RLS). Results There were no significant differences in LV volumes, masses or systolic function between cases and controls; none of the participants had non-compaction cardiomyopathy. Semi-automated assessment of LV non-compaction was highly reproducible. Non-compacted LV mass (median 14.0 [interquartile range 12.6–16.0] g/m2 vs. 12.7 [10.4–16.6] g/m2, p = 0.045), the ratio of non-compacted to compacted LV mass (mean 25.6 ± 4.2% vs. 22.8 ± 6.0%, p = 0.015) and the percentage of non-compacted LV volume (mean 17.6 ± 2.9% vs. 15.7 ± 3.8%, p = 0.004) were higher in cases compared to controls. In a multivariate conditional logistic regression model including non-compacted LV volume, RLS and body mass index, the percentage of non-compacted LV volume (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–2.18, p = 0.011) and the presence of RLS (OR 11.94, 95% CI 1.14–124.94, p = 0.038) were independently associated with cryptogenic ischemic stroke. Conclusions LV non-compaction is associated with a heightened risk of cryptogenic ischemic stroke in young adults, independent of concomitant RLS and in the absence of cardiomyopathy.

https://openalex.org/W3049516871,"The Western North-Pacific (WNP) gray whale feeding grounds are off the northeastern coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia and is comprised of a nearshore and offshore component that can be distinguished by both depth and location. Spatial movements of gray whales within their foraging grounds were examined based on 13 years of opportunistic vessel and shore-based photo-identification surveys. Site fidelity was assessed by examining annual return and resighting rates. Lagged Identification Rates (LIR) analyses were conducted to estimate the residency and transitional movement patterns within the two components of their feeding grounds. In total 243 individuals were identified from 2002–2014, among these were 94 calves. The annual return rate over the period 2002–2014 was 72%, excluding 35 calves only seen one year. Approximately 20% of the individuals identified from 2002–2010 were seen every year after their initial sighting (including eight individuals that returned for 13 consecutive years). The majority (239) of the WNP whales were observed in the nearshore area while only half (122) were found in the deeper offshore area. Within a foraging season, there was a significantly higher probability of gray whales moving from the nearshore to the offshore area. No mother-calf pairs, calves or yearlings were observed in the offshore area, which was increasingly used by mature animals. The annual return rates, and population growth rates that are primarily a result of calf production with little evidence of immigration, suggest that this population is demographically self-contained and that both the nearshore and offshore Sakhalin feeding grounds are critically important areas for their summer annual foraging activities. The nearshore habitat is also important for mother-calf pairs, younger individuals, and recently weaned calves. Nearshore feeding could also be energetically less costly compared to foraging in the deeper offshore habitat and provide more protection from predators, such as killer whales."
https://openalex.org/W3049606037,"We have demonstrated that exposing human breast tumour xenografts to ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles enhances tumour cell death and vascular disruption resulting from hyperthermia treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of varying the hyperthermia and ultrasound-stimulated microbubbles treatment parameters in order to optimize treatment bioeffects. Human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) tumour xenografts in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice were exposed to varying microbubble concentrations (0%, 0.1%, 1% or 3% v/v) and ultrasound sonication durations (0, 1, 3 or 5 min) at 570 kPa peak negative pressure and central frequency of 500 kHz. Five hours later, tumours were immersed in a 43°C water bath for varying hyperthermia treatment durations (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 or 60 minutes). Results indicated a significant increase in tumour cell death reaching 64 ± 5% with combined treatment compared to 11 ± 3% and 26 ± 5% for untreated and USMB-only treated tumours, respectively. A similar but opposite trend was observed in the vascular density of the tumours receiving the combined treatment. Optimal treatment parameters were found to consist of 40 minutes of heat with low power ultrasound treatment microbubble parameters of 1 minute of sonification and a 1% microbubble concentration."
https://openalex.org/W3049643677,"Background Research on HIV testing in Thailand has largely focused on at-risk population groups, with limited information about the prevalence of correlates of HIV testing among the Thai general population. This study addresses this gap in research by using a population-based probability sample to examine correlates of HIV testing experience and intention to test. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey in Nonthaburi, Thailand during October-December 2012 using tablet computers to collect self-administered questionnaires from 2138 men and women (aged 15–59 years) identified through three-stage stratified cluster sampling. Findings Almost half of the respondents, 962 (45%), reported having been tested for HIV while an almost equal proportion, 1032 (48.3%), indicated their intention to test for HIV. Being sexually experienced, having a history of sexually transmitted infection, personally knowing someone infected with HIV, and youth were associated with both history of HIV testing and intention to test for HIV. High perceived risk of HIV, knowledge of an HIV testing location, and having been married were associated with having been tested for HIV. Having been tested for HIV and HIV/AIDS education were associated with intention to test for HIV. The most common reasons for testing were routine medical checkup and antenatal care. The major reasons for not testing were perception of having no or low risk. Conclusion A substantially low proportion of the respondents reported a history of HIV testing and intention to test for HIV. Culturally appropriate programs that address HIV risk perception and provide accurate information related to HIV infection and HIV testing may be beneficial in increasing uptake of HIV testing among the general population in Thailand."
https://openalex.org/W3049232647,"Streptococcus suis is part of the pig commensal microbiome but strains can also be pathogenic, causing pneumonia and meningitis in pigs as well as zoonotic meningitis. According to genomic analysis, S. suis is divided into asymptomatic carriage, respiratory and systemic strains with distinct genomic signatures. Because the strategies to target pathogenic S. suis are limited, new therapeutic approaches are needed. The virulence factor S. suis adhesin P (SadP) recognizes the galabiose Galα1-4Gal-oligosaccharide. Based on its oligosaccharide fine specificity, SadP can be divided into subtypes PN and PO We show here that subtype PN is distributed in the systemic strains causing meningitis, whereas type PO is found in asymptomatic carriage and respiratory strains. Both types of SadP are shown to predominantly bind to pig lung globotriaosylceramide (Gb3). However, SadP adhesin from systemic subtype PN strains also binds to globotetraosylceramide (Gb4). Mutagenesis studies of the galabiose-binding domain of type PN SadP adhesin showed that the amino acid asparagine 285, which is replaced by an aspartate residue in type PO SadP, was required for binding to Gb4 and, strikingly, was also required for interaction with the glycomimetic inhibitor phenylurea-galabiose. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insight into the role of Asn-285 for Gb4 and phenylurea-galabiose binding, suggesting additional hydrogen bonding to terminal GalNAc of Gb4 and the urea group. Thus, the Asn-285-mediated molecular mechanism of type PN SadP binding to Gb4 could be used to selectively target S. suis in systemic disease without interfering with commensal strains, opening up new avenues for interventional strategies against this pathogen."

https://openalex.org/W3049745076,"Mixtures of drugs often have greater therapeutic value than any of their constituent drugs alone, and such combination therapies are widely used to treat diseases such as cancer, malaria, and viral infections. However, developing useful drug mixtures is challenging due to complex interactions between drugs. Natural substances can be fruitful sources of useful drug mixtures because secondary metabolites produced by living organisms do not often act in isolation in vivo. In order to facilitate the study of interactions within natural substances, a new analytical method to quantify interactions using data generated in the process of bioassay-guided fractionation is presented here: the extract fractional inhibitory concentration index (EFICI). The EFICI method uses the framework of Loewe additivity to calculate fractional inhibitory concentration values by which interactions can be determined for any combination of fractions that make up a parent extract. The EFICI method was applied to data on the bioassay-guided fractionation of Lechea mucronata and Schinus terebinthifolia for growth inhibition of the pathogenic bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii. The L. mucronata extract contained synergistic interactions (EFICI = 0.4181) and the S. terebinthifolia extract was non-interactive overall (EFICI = 0.9129). Quantifying interactions in the bioassay-guided fractionation of natural substances does not require additional experiments and can be useful to guide the experimental process and to support the development of standardized extracts as botanical drugs."

The research question of this study was ""to what extent can an interactive and open dialogue about substance use, queer health, and social responsibility foster transformative learning?""A collaborative and interdisciplinary project engaged the community as a teacher over the Summer and Fall of 2019 to address issues of substance use, queer health, and social responsibility and was delivered to 55 first-year undergraduate dental and 23 third-year dental hygiene students over three educational sessions. Dental and dental hygiene students were asked to reflect, in writing, on each session using between 200 and 400 words. Textual information from students' self-reflections and from the community's feedback were analyzed thematically for content (e.g., codes and themes).In total, 128 written reflections-for an average of 42 reflections per session-were gathered and analyzed interactively by the authors. Three major themes emerged: feeling privileged, breaking stereotypes, and coalescing learning. Feedback from the participating community members highlighted changes to be implemented in these sessions in the future, including more opportunities for small group activities in class.The three major themes that emerged from the thematic analysis of the self-reflections and community member feedback (feeling privileged, breaking stereotypes, and coalescing leaning) further highlighted the impact of community-driven curricula on students' learning in regard to substance use, queer health, and social responsibility.

https://openalex.org/W3049595678,"The setts of the European badger Meles meles can be cohabited during reproductive season by the red fox Vulpes vulpes and raccoon dog Nyctereutes procyonoides. There is no information on the possible impact of both species on the size of badgers’ litter. The aim of the study was to show the influence of cohabitation of the same setts by badger, raccoon dog and fox on the litter size. The research was conducted in 2012–2014 and 2018 in the lowland forests of western Poland. We conducted the survey of setts by direct observations and analysis of photographic material from trap cameras during mid-April–July each year. We recorded 85 badger litters, 18 fox litters, and 15 raccoon dog litters. Average litter size was 1.71 (±0.90), 2.44 (±1.34) and 4.93 (±2.76) litter mates in badgers, foxes and raccoon dogs, respectively for all observed pairs. Badger litter size did not differ between setts used only by badgers including pairs with no cubs (1.66 ± 0.98) and cohabited with foxes (1.90 ± 0.32) or raccoon dogs (1.88 ± 0.81). However, foxes reared even more cubs in setts cohabited with badgers than when badger was absent (2.90 ± 1.37 vs. 1.88 ± 1.13 respectively). In the case of raccoon dogs, there were no differences in the mean number of their cubs in setts with badgers (5.25 ± 2.92) and without badgers (4.57 ± 2.76). The results indicate that the cohabitation of setts by badgers, foxes and raccoon dogs does not affect litter size negatively."
https://openalex.org/W3048980008,"Troxerutin (TRX) is a water-soluble flavonoid which occurs commonly in the edible plants. Recent studies state that TRX improves the functionality of the nervous system and neutralizes Amyloid-ß induced neuronal toxicity. In this study, an in vitro assay based upon Neural stem cell (NSCs) isolated from the subventricular zone of the postnatal balb/c mice was established to explore the impact of TRX on individual neurogenesis processes in general and neuroprotective effect against ß-amyloid 1–42 (Aß42) induced inhibition in differentiation in particular. NSCs were identified exploiting immunostaining of the NSCs markers. Neurosphere clonogenic assay and BrdU/Ki67 immunostaining were employed to unravel the impact of TRX on proliferation. Differentiation experiments were carried out for a time span lasting from 48 h to 7 days utilizing ß-tubulin III and GFAP as neuronal and astrocyte marker respectively. Protective effects of TRX on Aß42 induced depression of NSCs differentiation were determined after 48 h of application. A neurosphere migration assay was carried out for 24 h in the presence and absence of TRX. Interestingly, TRX enhanced neuronal differentiation of NSCs in a dose-dependent manner after 48 h and 7 days of incubation and significantly enhanced neurite growth. A higher concentration of TRX also neutralized the inhibitory effects of Aß42 on neurite outgrowth and length after 48 h of incubation. TRX significantly stimulated cell migration. Overall, TRX not only promoted NSCs differentiation and migration but also neutralized the inhibitory effects of Aß42 on NSCs. TRX, therefore, offers an interesting lead structure from the perspective of drug design especially to promote neurogenesis in neurological disorders i.e. Alzheimer’s disease."
https://openalex.org/W3049054615,"Accurate dosimetry for a real wireless power transfer system (WPT) using electromagnetic resonance and electromagnetic induction requires an accurate description of the field formed by the system. In particular, the electromagnetic field depends on factors such as the construction of the transmitting and receiving coils, the circuit configuration, the input source of the front end of the transmitting coil, and the input impedance of the rear end of receiving coil. However, both circuit and electromagnetic simulations need to be performed to analyze the entire system, which is a difficult task. In order to overcome this difficulty, a method using an equivalent circuit model is proposed and verified through experiments. Moreover, the worst exposure condition to a magnetic field was examined by considering three variables: the charging mode, the state of charge, and the alignment and misalignment between the transmitting and receiving coils. Accordingly, the strongest magnetic field was created in the constant current mode in the fully charged state with misalignment. For example, the magnetic field strength in the case of 80% state of charge and misalignment was 1.397 times greater than in the case of 20% state of charge and alignment at a point 10 mm from the transmission pad. Finally, the induced electric fields and induced current densities were calculated by using a Japanese adult male whole-body voxel human model, and the results were compared with the values recommended by international guidelines to ascertain their compliance."

The objective of this study is to describe the types, prevalence and correlates of social violence among Thai secondary school students, with a focus on gender role non-conformity. Methods This article uses secondary data from a national study of 2070 secondary school students aged 13–20 years representing Bangkok and all four regions of Thailand. Students were asked about their gender/sexual identity, self-perception of their masculinity or femininity, and experiences of social violence. Correlates of social violence were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Results Prevalence of social violence victimization was high (57%). Most students considered themselves to be as masculine or as feminine as other members of their sex (82.6%), while 9.1% thought that they were less masculine/less feminine, and 8.3% thought they were more masculine/more feminine. Students who considered themselves less masculine or less feminine than others of their sex (AOR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.13, 2.25) were more likely to experience social violence, compared to students who considered themselves equally masculine/feminine. Students who self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.86) were also more likely to experience social violence, compared to students who did not identify as LGBT. However, students who considered themselves more masculine or feminine than other students of their sex (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.88) were less likely to experience social violence. Discussion Students who identified as LGBT, or considered themselves to be less masculine or less feminine than other students of their sex, had higher odds of social violence victimization. Anti-bullying campaigns need to emphasize that perpetrating social violence is not tolerated, and gender-based violence needs to be included in comprehensive sexuality education curricula."
https://openalex.org/W3049205897,"RNA interference (RNAi), a technique used to investigate gene function in insects and other organisms, is attracting attention as a potential new technology for mosquito control. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) was recently engineered to produce interfering RNA molecules that silence genes required for mosquito survival, but which do not correspond to genes in humans or other non-target organisms. The resulting yeast pesticides, which facilitate cost-effective production and delivery of interfering RNA to mosquito larvae that eat the yeast, effectively kill mosquitoes in laboratory and semi-field trials. In preparation for field evaluation of larvicides in Trinidad, a Caribbean island with endemic diseases resulting from pathogens transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, adult residents living in the prospective trial site communities of Curepe, St. Augustine, and Tamana were engaged. Open community forums and paper surveys were used to assess the potential acceptability, societal desirability, and sustainability of yeast interfering RNA larvicides. These assessments revealed that Trinidadians have good working knowledge of mosquitoes and mosquito-borne illnesses. A majority of the respondents practiced some method of larval mosquito control and agreed that they would use a new larvicide if it were proven to be safe and effective. During the community engagement forums, participants were educated about mosquito biology, mosquito-borne diseases, and the new yeast larvicides. When invited to provide feedback, engagement forum attendees were strongly supportive of the new technology, raised few concerns, and provided helpful advice regarding optimal larvicide formulations, insecticide application, operational approaches for using the larvicides, and pricing. The results of these studies suggest that the participants are supportive of the potential use of yeast interfering RNA larvicides in Trinidad and that the communities assessed in this investigation represent viable field sites."
https://openalex.org/W3049226858,"Wildlife ranching, although not considered a conventional conservation system, provides a sustainable model for wildlife utilization and could be a source of valuable genetic material. However, increased fragmentation and intensive management may threaten the evolutionary potential and conservation value of species. Disease-free Cape buffalo (Syncerus caffer caffer) in southern Africa exist in populations with a variety of histories and management practices. We compared the genetic diversity of buffalo in national parks to private ranches and found that, except for Addo Elephant National Park, genetic diversity was high and statistically equivalent. We found that relatedness and inbreeding levels were not substantially different between ranched populations and those in national parks, indicating that breeding practices likely did not yet influence genetic diversity of buffalo on private ranches in this study. High genetic differentiation between South African protected areas highlighted their fragmented nature. Structure analysis revealed private ranches comprised three gene pools, with origins from Addo Elephant National Park, Kruger National Park and a third, unsampled gene pool. Based on these results, we recommend the Addo population be supplemented with disease-free Graspan and Mokala buffalo (of Kruger origin). We highlight the need for more research to characterize the genetic diversity and composition of ranched wildlife species, in conjunction with wildlife ranchers and conservation authorities, in order to evaluate the implications for management and conservation of these species across different systems."
https://openalex.org/W3049715207,"T-cell activation is a critical part of the adaptive immune system, enabling responses to foreign cells and external stimulus. In this process, T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) activation stimulates translocation of the downstream kinase PKCθ to the membrane, leading to NF-κB activation and thus transcription of relevant genes. However, the details of how PKCθ is recruited to the membrane remain enigmatic. It is known that annexin A5 (ANXA5), a calcium-dependent membrane-binding protein, has been reported to mediate PKCδ activation by interaction with PKCδ, a homologue of PKCθ, which implicates a potential role of ANXA5 involved in PKCθ signaling. Here we demonstrate that ANXA5 does play a critical role in the recruitment of PKCθ to the membrane during T-cell activation. ANXA5 knockout in Jurkat T cells substantially inhibited the membrane translocation of PKCθ upon TCR engagement and blocked the recruitment of CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1 signalosome, which provides a platform for the catalytic activation of IKKs and subsequent activation of canonical NF-κB signaling in activated T cells. As a result, NF-κB activation was impaired in ANXA5-KO T cells. T-cell activation was also suppressed by ANAX5 knockdown in primary T cells.

Engagement of TCR-CD3 complex with co-receptor CD28 recruits large signaling complexes to signal transduction cascades. The serine/threonine-specific protein kinase C (PKC) activity is required for TCR/CD3-induced T-cell activation (2Gaud G. Lesourne R. Love P.E. Regulatory mechanisms in T cell receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 (29789755): 485-49710.1038/s41577-018-0020-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). PKCθ, a novel calcium-independent member of the PKC family, is proved to selectively mediate several essential functions in TCR-linked signaling, leading to cell activation (3Gerondakis S. Fulford T.S. Messina N.L. Grumont R.J. NF-κB control of T cell development.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 (24352326): 15-2510.1038/ni.2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). PKCθ-deficient T cells displayed defects in TCR-induced proliferation and differentiation (4Sun Z. Arendt C.W. Ellmeier W. Schaeffer E.M. Sunshine M.J. Gandhi L. Annes J. Petrzilka D. Kupfer A.

PKCθ is usually found in the cytosol when inactive. Upon TCR stimulation, PKCθ rapidly translocates to membrane lipid rafts and activates the downstream signaling, which subsequently results in NF-κB activation (5Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Antigen-induced translocation of PKC-θ to membrane rafts is required for T cell activation.Nat.

PKCθ translocation to lipid rafts plays a pivotal role in T-cell activation, but the molecular basis of PKCθ translocation has not been elucidated. There have been some investigations on the molecular events of triggering the membrane-bound PKCθ in T-cell activation. PKCθ has no obvious raft-targeting motif, so the lipid raft localization of PKC needs the association with another raft-targeted signaling protein. The cysteine-rich C1 domain of PKCθ can bind membrane-containing second messenger DAG upon stimulation (7Carrasco S. Merida I. Diacylglycerol-dependent binding recruits PKCθ and RasGRP1 C1 domains to specific subcellular localizations in living T lymphocytes.Mol. Biol.

Although much is known about PKCθ activation, the process of PKCθ translocation and the proteins that regulate it need further identification. The annexin superfamily (Anx) is a calcium (Ca2+)- and phospholipid-binding protein family. Annexin A5 (ANXA5) belongs to the annexin family, which is well-known for its high affinity to phosphatidylserine (PS) and widely used in apoptosis detection (12Volker G. Moss S.E. Annexins: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82 (11917092): 331-37110.1152/physrev.00030.2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar), even in molecular imaging for disease diagnosis in clinical applications (13Sebastian S. Denise P. Ursula R. Annexins in translational research: hidden treasures to be found.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2018; 19 (29914106): 1781-179810.3390/ijms19061781Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ANXA5 is involved in various intra- and extracellular processes, including blood coagulation, anti-inflammatory processes, membrane trafficking, and signal transduction (14Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Annexins: linking Ca2+ signalling to membrane dynamics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 (15928709): 449-46110.1038/nrm1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar). However, the biological functions of ANXA5 are believed to depend primarily on its interactions with lipids in membranes. Several annexins have been reported to interact with different PKC isozymes, such as AnxA1, -A2, -A5, and -A6 (15Hoque M. Rentero C. Cairns R. Tebar F. Enrich C. Grewal T. Annexins—scaffolds modulating PKC localization and signaling.Cell. Signal. 2014; 26 (24582587): 1213-122510.1016/j.cellsig.2014.02.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It has been shown that ANXA5 interacts with PKCδ as an essential step in PKCδ translocation and activation (16Kheifets V. Bright R. Inagaki K. Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Protein kinase C δ (δPKC)-annexin V interaction: a required step in δPKC translocation and function.J. Biol.

PKCθ is most closely related to PKCδ, because the V1 domains of these two enzymes share 49% homology (17Spitaler M. Cantrell D.A. Protein kinase C and beyond.Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5 (15282562): 785-79010.1038/ni1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Ponting C.P. Parker P.J. Extending the C2 domain family: C2s in PKCs δ, ε, η, θ, phospholipases, GAPs, and perforin.Protein Sci. 1996; 5 (8771209): 162-16610.1002/pro.5560050120Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, the V1 domain of PKCδ is required for interaction with ANXA5, so we hypothesize that ANXA5 might be involved in PKCθ membrane translocation and PKCθ-mediated function by interaction with PKCθ. In this study, we demonstrate that ANXA5 is involved in T-cell activation by ANXA5-PKCθ interaction. ANXA5 deficiency selectively inhibited PKCθ-mediated NF-κB activation via blocking the recruitment of CARMA1/BCL10/MALT1 complex. Our results present a novel role of ANXA5 on PKCθ signaling in T-cell activation. To investigate the role of ANXA5 in T-cell activation, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1A). There are three main types of stimulus for T-cell activation: anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and concanavalin A (ConA) (1Smith-Garvin J.E. Koretzky G.A. Jordan M.S. T cell activation.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27 (19132916): 591-61910.1146/annurev.immunol.021908.132706Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar, 19Chen L. Flies D.B. Molecular mechanisms of T cell co-stimulation and co-inhibition.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2013; 13 (23470321): 227-24210.1038/nri3405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). With the treatment of each stimulus, T-cell activation was examined in both ANXA5-KO and WT Jurkat T cells. CD69 as a T-cell activation marker is always used to evaluate the degree of T-cell activation by FACS analysis. After 24 h of stimulation, the induction of CD69 expression was readily apparent in WT Jurkat T cells, but not in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1, B and C). By CCK8 assay, ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells were also shown to be defective in cell proliferation upon anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (Fig. 1D). During T-cell activation, TCR-CD3 engagement leads to increased production of interleukin-2 (IL-2) (20Spolski R. Li P. Leonard W.J. Biology and regulation of IL-2: from molecular mechanisms to human therapy.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 (30089912): 648-65910.1038/s41577-018-0046-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that the production of IL-2 was effectively up-regulated in Jurkat T cells responding to various stimulus, but little change was detected in ANXA5-KO cells (Fig. 1E). Collectively, our data suggested that ANXA5 plays an important role in T-cell activation. To explore the signal transduction pathway of ANXA5 in T-cell activation, three major signaling pathways ERK, p38 MAPK, and NF-κB, were examined. In response to anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation, the activations of ERK and MAPK pathways were intact in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells, but NF-κB activation was impaired (Fig. 2A). The defects on the NF-κB pathway were reconfirmed in two other clones of ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells (Fig. S1). Similarly, with the treatment of ConA or TPA, ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells also showed impaired NF-κB activation but normal ERK and p38 MAPK pathways (Fig. 2, B and C). When the expression of ANXA5 was recovered by transfection in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells, partial rescue of the IKK activation was observed (Fig. 2D). Together, these results suggested that ANXA5 modulated T-cell activation via the NF-κB signaling pathway. A number of studies have indicated that PKC isozymes play a critical role in mature T-cell activation. We examined the kinase activity of PKC isozymes in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells. Upon TPA stimulation, PKC activity was weaker in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells compared with the parent Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3A), suggesting that ANXA5 deletion partially suppressed PKC activation. By examination of various PKC isoforms, we found that ANXA5 knockout selectively inhibited PKCθ activation, whereas it had no impact on PKCα and PKCμ activations (Fig. 3B). PKCθ is mainly expressed in T cells and involved in TCR-induced proliferation, cytokine production, and differentiation (21Hayashi K. Altman A. Protein kinase C θ (PKCθ): a key player in T cell life and death.Pharmacol. Res. 2007; 55 (17544292): 537-54410.1016/j.phrs.2007.04.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Differing from other PKCs in T cells, PKCθ is unique in its translocation to the site of the immunological synapse on the plasma membrane (3Gerondakis S. Fulford T.S. Messina N.L. Grumont R.J. NF-κB control of T cell development.Nat. Immunol. 2014; 15 (24352326): 15-2510.1038/ni.2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Membrane translocation of cytosolic PKC is the hallmark of PKC activation (22Gould C. Newton A. The life and death of protein kinase C.Curr. Drug Targets. 2008; 9 (18691009): 614-62510.2174/138945008785132411Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Based on the above finding, we speculated a possibility that ANXA5 acts as a PKCθ membrane target. To test this hypothesis, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay in Jurkat T cells. There was ANXA5-PKCθ interaction in normal T cells, and their interaction was significantly enhanced in activated T cells (Fig. 3C), suggesting that ANXA5 is involved in T-cell activation by association with PKCθ. The Ca2+ increase is an early signaling following the engagement of TCR (2Gaud G. Lesourne R. Love P.E. Regulatory mechanisms in T cell receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2018; 18 (29789755): 485-49710.1038/s41577-018-0020-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). ANXA5 can rapidly translocate from the cytosol to the plasma membrane upon Ca2+ elevation (the elevation of calcium ion concentration) (15Hoque M. Rentero C. Cairns R. Tebar F. Enrich C. Grewal T. Annexins—scaffolds modulating PKC localization and signaling.Cell. Signal. 2014; 26 (24582587): 1213-122510.1016/j.cellsig.2014.02.012Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). There was no obvious difference in the increase of Ca2+ initiated by anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation between ANXA5-KO and WT Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3D). Next, we tested whether ANXA5 is required for PKCθ translocation. By immunofluorescence observation, ANXA5 and PKCθ were distributed in the cytoplasm in resting Jurkat T cells and rapidly translocated and co-localized in the plasma membrane upon anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (Fig. 3E). However, in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells, PKCθ was predominately located in the cytosol, and there was almost no localization on the membrane in response to TCR stimulus, supporting ANXA5 as a binding target for PKCθ translocation in the process of T-cell activation (Fig. 3E). Further confirmation was performed using cellular fractionation for Western blotting analysis. Consistent with the immunofluorescence observation, PKCθ was not detected in the membrane fraction, indicating that PKCθ translocation was lost in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells. In contrast, the presence of ANXA5 in Jurkat T cells led to membrane-bound PKCθ following anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (Fig. 3F). Together, our data suggested that ANXA5 was a PKCθ-binding protein required for PKCθ translocation on the membrane. Recent reports have shown that PKCθ cooperates with CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex to activate the NF-κB pathway. To validate the importance of ANXA5-PKCθ association for NF-κB activation, we generated PKCθ knockout cells on the basis of Jurkat T cells for investigation (Fig. S2A). As expected, NF-κB activation was inhibited, but ERK and p38 activations were unaffected in PKCθ-KO Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4), just like the same phenotype in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells. Next, we examined the effect of ANXA5 on PKCθ-mediated function. The PKCθ-mediated CARMA1 phosphorylation is crucial for the assembly of CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 (CBM) signaling complex in T cells (23David L. Li Y. Ma J. Garner E. Zhang X. Wu H. Assembly mechanism of the CARMA1-BCL10-MALT1-TRAF6 signalosome.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115 (29382759): 1499-150410.1073/pnas.1721967115Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consistent with this report, the phosphorylation of CARMA1 was actually inhibited in PKCθ-KO Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4B), which was reconfirmed by another clone of PKCθ-KO cells (Fig. S2B). Similar to PKCθ-KO Jurkat T cells, ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells also showed the inhibition on the phosphorylation of CARMA1 in response to anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (Fig. 4C) or TPA (Fig. 4D) or ConA treatment (Fig. 4E). Phosphorylated CARMA1 acts as a seed for CBM complex assembly in TCR-mediated cell activation. Consistently, we found that there were normal translocations of CARMA1, Bcl10, and MALT1 from the soluble to the cell membrane fraction in WT Jurkat T cells, but little in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells (Fig. 4F). Furthermore, we validated the involvement of ANXA5 in the CBM complex formation by a co-immunoprecipitation assay. The result showed that the formation of the CBM complex was weakened in the absence of ANXA5 but strengthened in the presence of ANXA5, especially in activated T cells (Fig. 4G). Finally, we verified the role of ANXA5 in primary T-cell activation. T lymphocytes isolated from lymph nodes were electrotransfected with ANXA5 siRNAs to knock down endogenous ANXA5 level. With about 16–20% transfection efficiency, the reduced endogenous ANXA5 was detected by Western blotting (Fig. S3). Then these ANXA5 siRNA–treated T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 co-stimulation and analyzed for CD69 expression by FACS. In both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the increased CD69 expression induced by TCR stimulation was clearly inhibited by ANXA5 knockdown and, importantly, was rescued by the recovery expression of ANXA5 (Fig. 4H). These results demonstrate that ANXA5 is an important regulator linked to T-cell activation. T-cell activation is accompanied by the clustering of lipid rafts to the site of T-cell engagement and the recruitment of different intracellular signaling proteins into these rafts. Lipid raft recruitment is required for PKCθ to activate NF-κB (5Bi K. Tanaka Y. Coudronniere N. Sugie K. Hong S. van Stipdonk M.J. Altman A. Antigen-induced translocation of PKC-θ to membrane rafts is required for T cell activation.Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2 (11376344): 556-56310.1038/88765Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The details of PKCθ translocation are not completely defined in T-cell activation. DAG weakly recruited PKCθ to the membrane, and the PS binding of PKCθ phosphorylation was reported to enhance its binding to DAG, resulting in PKCθ activation (21Hayashi K. Altman A. Protein kinase C θ (PKCθ): a key player in T cell life and death.Pharmacol. Res. 2007; 55 (17544292): 537-54410.1016/j.phrs.2007.04.009Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). ANXA5 has high PS-binding ability and translocates to membranes, dependent on the increased intracellular Ca2+ levels (14Gerke V. Creutz C.E. Moss S.E. Annexins: linking Ca2+ signalling to membrane dynamics.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6 (15928709): 449-46110.1038/nrm1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar, 24Moss S.E. Morgan R.O. The annexins.Genome Biol. 2004; 5 (15059252): 21910.1186/gb-2004-5-4-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). In this study, we reveal an important role of ANXA5 in T-cell activation and provide evidence that ANXA5 may act as an early sensor in PKCθ translocation and activation. As we all know, TCR-stimulated PLCγ1 activity stimulates Ca2+-permeable ion channel receptors (IP3R) on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, leading to the release of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores into the cytoplasm. We found that ANXA5 translocated to the membrane along with Ca2+ elevation during T-cell activation, which was essential for the lipid raft recruitment of PKCθ. ANXA5 was previously reported to play a prominent scaffolding role for PKCδ in various signal transduction pathways relevant in cancer (16Kheifets V. Bright R. Inagaki K. Schechtman D. Mochly-Rosen D. Protein kinase C δ (δPKC)-annexin V interaction: a required step in δPKC translocation and function.J. Biol.

Here we demonstrate that ANXA5 interacts with PKCθ and contributes to the membrane translocation of PKCθ in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 3). Our studies indicate that the ANXA5-PKCθ interaction precedes PKCθ translocation and is an essential step in the function of PKCθ. ANXA5 knockout inhibited TCR-induced PKCθ activity. Like the downstream signal transduction of PKCθ, the assembly of CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex and NF-κB activation were both inhibited by ANXA5 knockout in T-cell activation (Fig. 4). Consistently, the formation of CARMA1-Bcl10-MALT1 complex in the membrane-bound state was undetected in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells. Furthermore, there were the same phenotypes between ANXA5-KO and PKCθ-KO T cells, such as the defective NF-κB activation and intact ERK and p38 MAPK pathways, suggesting a functional link between ANXA5 and PKCθ on NF-κB signaling in T cell activation. Recent studies have highlighted the essential role of PKCθ in activating the NF-κB signaling pathway in T cells. PKCθ, but not other PKCs, mediates the activation of the NF-κB complex induced by TCR/CD28 co-stimulation via selective activation of IκB kinase β (IKKβ) (25Xin L. O'Mahony A. Yajun M. Romas G. Warner C. Protein kinase C-θ participates in NF-κB activation induced by CD3-CD28 costimulation through selective activation of IκB kinase β.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20 (10733597): 2933-294010.1128/mcb.20.8.2933-2940.2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, NF-κB activation represents the most critical target of PKCθ in the TCR signal leading to production of IL-2, a major T-cell growth factor. In ANXA5-KO T cells, IL-2 production was significantly inhibited, supporting the involvement of ANXA5 in TCR-induced PKCθ activity. Notably, the phosphorylation of PKCθ, not PKCα and PKCμ, was inhibited in the absence of ANXA5, suggesting the selective regulation of ANXA5 on PKCθ function. Studies on PKCθ-deficient mice showed apparently relieved symptoms of multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and asthma (26Healy A.M. Izmailova E. Fitzgerald M. Walker R.

Future research on ANXA5 in modulating PKCθ activation might serve as a new target for the selective regulation of PKC signaling in health and disease. Several annexins have been reported in immunological process, such as ANXA1, ANXA2, and ANXA6 (31Bruschi M. Petretto A. Vaglio A. Santucci L. Candiano G. Ghiggeri G.M.

Our study fills a gap in this knowledge about an important role of ANXA5 in T-cell activation. ANXA5 as a PKCθ association partner will provide new clues to the complicated molecular mechanism of PKCθ function during T-cell activation. The human acute T-cell leukemia cell line Jurkat (ATCC TIB-152™) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco), 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin (Gibco). Primary T cells were prepared from lymph node of mice. Cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. All experiments were approved by the State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University. Gene knockout was conducted with a CRISPR/Cas9 system as described previously (34Qian X. Li X. Shi Z. Xia Y. Cai Q. Xu D. Tan L. Du L. Zheng Y. Zhao D. Zhang C. Lorenzi P.L. You Y. Jiang B.H. Jiang T. et al.PTEN suppresses glycolysis by dephosphorylating and inhibiting autophosphorylated PGK1.Mol.

Single guide RNAs targeting the ANXA5 (5′-AGGGTACTACCAGCGGATGT-3′) and PKCθ (5′-GCCGCCATGTTTACCGACAC-3′) genes were designed using an online CRISPR design platform (https://zlab.bio/guide-design-resources), and each was cloned into pLentiCRISPRv2. Briefly, HEK-293T cells were co-transfected with constructed pLentiCRISPRv2 plasmid and lentiviral envelope plasmids (PL3, PL4, and PL5). The viruses were harvested by ultracentrifugation 3 days after transfection. Viruses were then added into the cultures of Jurkat T cells, followed by selection with puromycin (2 μg/ml). Finally, single-cell clones were separated by serial dilutions in a 96-well plate and then transferred to 6-well plates. The knockout cell clones were identified by Western blotting. For the recovery expression in ANXA5-KO Jurkat T cells, human ANXA5 cDNA was cloned into the plenti6/v5-D-Topo expression vector (Invitrogen). Then ANXA5 expression plasmid and lentiviral envelope plasmids (PL3, PL4, and PL5) were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells. The viruses were harvested on day 3. Then ANXA5-KO cells were treated with lentiviral transduction. 24 h after transduction, 10 μg/ml blasticidin was added into the medium for selection. Finally, the expression of ANAX5 was detected by Western blotting. Cells were cytospun, fixed with 3.75% formaldehyde/PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After blocking with 10% goat serum, sections were incubated with anti-human PKCθ and ANXA5 primary antibodies (1:50; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, USA) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, slides were incubated with appropriate fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Slides were counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). All images were visualized and captured by a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss AX10, Carl Zeiss AG, Jena, Germany). Cells were seeded at a density of 1000 cells/plate and were maintained in culture for 0, 48, 72, and 108 h. Cell proliferation was detected by a CCK8 cell proliferation kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China). Cell activation was measured by a flow cytometer (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences, Mississauga, Canada) equipped with Cell Quest software (BD Biosciences). Antibodies against human CD69 or mouse CD69 were purchased from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Cells were fractionated using a membrane protein extraction kit (Beyotime). Briefly, cells were lysed using lysis buffer A provided by the kit and then homogenized in ice. The lysates were centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and spun at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellets were suspended using extraction buffer B and incubated for 20 min. After centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was used as the membranous fraction. The samples were then analyzed by Western blotting. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen Life Technologies). Reverse transcription was accomplished with a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara). Quantitative PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vazyme) on a StepOne/StepOne PlusTM real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). Sequence-specific primers for human IL-2 (forward primer, 5′-TACAAGAATCCCAAACTCACCAG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GGCACAAAAAGAATCATAAAAGA-3′) and human actin (forward primer, 5′-TGGTGATGGAGGAGGTTTAGTAAGT-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AACCAATAAAACCTACTCCTCCCTTAA-3′) were used. 6–12-week-old mice were purchased from the Model Animal Research Center of Nanjing University. All the animal experiments were approved by the Nanjing University Animal Care and Use Committee. The mice were sacrificed and sterilized with 75% ethanol. Lymph nodes were isolated and prepared for single-cell suspension. Primary murine T cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 10% fetal calf serum. For primary murine T-cell transfection, the mouse T Cell NucleofectorTM kit (Lonza) was used for electrotransfection with the Amaxa transfection device NucleofectorTM II according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of room temperature Nucleofector® solution (Lonza) and electroporated with 40 pmol of negative control siRNAs, 40 pmol of ANXA5 siRNA, or 40 pmol of ANXA5 siRNAs together with 2 μg of plasmid pCMV-ANXA5, respectively. CD69 expression was examined by flow cytometer 24 h after electrotransfection. The transfection of 2 μg of pmax-GFP (Lonza) was used as a positive control for indicating the transfection efficiency measured by flow cytometer. Negative control siRNA (5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT-3′) and mouse ANXA5 siRNA (5′-AUGCUCCGAAUAGACUUCACGTT-3′) were purchased from GenePharma. The plasmid of pCMV-ANXA5 was constructed and stored by our laboratory. All experiments were conducted at least three times.

https://openalex.org/W3049751217,"The source-sink relationship determines the ultimate grain yield of rice. In this study, we used a set of reciprocal introgression lines (ILs) derived from Xuishui09 × IR2061 to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that were associated with sink-, source-, and grain yield-related traits. A total of 95 QTLs influencing eight measured traits were identified using 6181 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Nine background-independent QTLs were consistently detected in seven chromosomal regions in different genetic backgrounds. Seven QTLs clusters simultaneously affected sink-, source-, and grain yield-related traits, probably due to the genetic basis of significant correlations of grain yield with source and sink traits. We selected 15 candidate genes in the four QTLs consistently identified in the two populations by performing gene-based association and haplotype analyses using 2288 accessions from the 3K project. Among these, LOC_Os03g48970 for qTSN3b, LOC_Os06g04710 for qFLL6a, and LOC_Os07g32510 for qTGW7 were considered as the most likely candidate genes based on functional annotations. These results provide a basis for further study of candidate genes and for the development of high-yield rice varieties by balancing source-sink relationships using marker-assisted selection."

Thus in this paper, we propose a deep neural network for diagnose on MR Images of tumors of the hand in order to better define preoperative diagnosis and standardize surgical treatment.We collected MRI figures of 221 patients with hand tumors from one medical center from 2016 to 2019, invited medical experts to annotate the images to form the annotation data set. Then the original image is preprocessed to get the image data set. The data set is randomly divided into ten parts, nine for training and one for test. Next, the data set is input into the neural network system for testing. Finally, average the results of ten experiments as an estimate of the accuracy of the algorithm.This research uses 221 images as dataset and the system shows an average confidence level of 71.6% in segmentation of hand tumors. The segmented tumor regions are validated through ground truth analysis and manual analysis by a radiologist.With the recent advances in convolutional neural networks, vast improvements have been made for image segmentation, mainly based on the skip-connection-linked encoder decoder deep architectures. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an automatic segmentation method based on DeepLab v3+ and achieved a good diagnostic accuracy rate."
https://openalex.org/W3049181340,"Although an impact of processing on immunogenicity of food proteins has clearly been demonstrated, the underlying mechanisms are still unclear. We applied 3 different processing methods: wet heating (60 °C) and low- or high-temperature (50 °C or 130 °C, respectively) dry-heating in absence or presence of reducing sugars, to β-lactoglobulin (BLG), lysozyme and thyroglobulin, which represent dietary proteins with different pI or molecular weight. Uptake of the soluble fraction of the samples was tested in two types of, genetically homogeneous, antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells derived from THP-1 monocytes). This revealed a strong correlation between the uptake of the different protein samples by macrophages and dendritic cells, and confirmed the key role of hydrophobicity, over aggregation, in determining the uptake. Several uptake routes were shown to contribute to the uptake of BLG by macrophages. However, cytokine responses following exposure of macrophages to BLG samples were not related to the levels of uptake. Together, our results demonstrate that heat-treatment-induced increased hydrophobicity is the prime driving factor in uptake, but not in cytokine production, by THP-1 macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W3049379905,"Mammalian olfactory receptor neurons in the nasal cavity are stimulated by odorants carried by the inhaled air and their activation is therefore tied to and driven by the breathing or sniffing frequency. Sniffing frequency can be deliberately modulated to alter how odorants stimulate olfactory receptor neurons, giving the animal control over the frequency of odorant exposure to potentially aid odorant detection and discrimination. We monitored sniffing behaviors and odorant discrimination ability of freely-moving mice while they sampled either decreasing concentrations of target odorants or sampled a fixed target odorant concentration in the presence of a background of increasing odorant concentrations, using a Go-NoGo behavioral paradigm. This allowed us to ask how mice alter their odorant sampling duration and sampling (sniffing) frequency depending on the demands of the task and its difficulty. Mice showed an anticipatory increase in sniffing rate prior to odorant exposure and chose to sample for longer durations when exposed to odorants as compared to the solvent control odorant. Similarly, mice also took more odorant sampling sniffs when exposed to target odorants compared to the solvent control odorant. In general, odorant sampling strategies became more similar the more difficult the task was, e.g. the lower the target odorant concentration or the lower the target odorant contrast relative to the background odorant, suggesting that sniffing patterns are not preset, but are dynamically modulated by the particular task and its difficulty."

CT (Somatom Definition Flash, Siemens Healthineers) was performed at 120kVp and 80kVp, each combined with current-time products of 120, 60, 30, and 12mAs, and was reconstructed with filtered back projection (FBP) and IR (Safire, Siemens Healthineers). Mean lung density (LD), air density (AD) and noise were measured by semi-automated region-of interest (ROI) analysis, with 120kVp/120 mAs serving as the standard of reference.Using IR, noise in lung parenchyma was reduced by ~ 31% at high attenuating chest wall and by ~ 22% at low attenuating chest wall compared to FBP, respectively (p<0.05). IR induced changes in the order of ±1 HU to mean absolute LD and AD compared to corresponding FBP reconstructions which were statistically significant (p<0.05).Densitometry is influenced by acquisition parameters and reconstruction algorithms to a degree that may be clinically negligible. However, in longitudinal studies and clinical research identical protocols and potentially other measures for calibration may be required."
https://openalex.org/W3049313253,"Pelagic seabirds are elusive species which are difficult to observe, thus determining their spatial distribution during the migration period is a difficult task. Here we undertook the first long-term study on the distribution of migrating shearwaters from data gathered within the framework of citizen science projects. Specifically, we collected daily abundance (only abundance given presence) of Balearic shearwaters from 2005 to 2017 from the online databases Trektellen and eBird. We applied machine-learning techniques, specifically Random Forest regression models, to predict shearwater abundance during migration using 15 environmental predictors. We built separated models for pre-breeding and post-breeding migration. When evaluated for the total data sample, the models explained more than 52% of the variation in shearwater abundance. The models also showed good ability to predict shearwater distributions for both migration periods (correlation between observed and predicted abundance was about 70%). However, relative variable importance and variation among the models built with different training data subsamples differed between migration periods. Our results showed that data gathered in citizen science initiatives together with recently available high-resolution satellite imagery, can be successfully applied to describe the migratory spatio-temporal patterns of seabird species accurately. We show that a predictive modelling approach may offer a powerful and cost-effective tool for the long-term monitoring of the migratory patterns in sensitive marine species, as well as to identify at sea areas relevant for their protection. Modelling approaches can also be essential tools to detect the impacts of climate and other global changes in this and other species within the range of the training data."
https://openalex.org/W3049417129,"Objective The study was aimed to explore patient safety culture of community pharmacists working in Dessie and Gondar towns, Northern Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from 1st to 31st March 2018. In this cross-sectional survey, the Pharmacy Survey on Patient Safety Culture (PSOPSC), developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), was used to collect data. PSOPSC is a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed among staffs who work in community pharmacies of Dessie and Gondar towns. All staffs available on data collection period in the pharmacy were included. The Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software version 25 was used to enter and analyze the data. Results A total of 120 participants were approached and completed the questionnaire. Results from the study showed that high positive response rate was demonstrated in the domains of “Teamwork” (90.2%) followed by physical space and environment (83.1%). On the other hand, the result also identified that there is an enormous problem related to mistake communication (44.8%) and work pressure (45%). In addition, significant difference of percent positive responses were obtained across towns and staff working hours. Conclusions The patient safety culture of community pharmacists is appreciable especially with respect to their teamwork. Besides, urgent attention should be given to areas of weakness, mainly in the domain of “mistake communication” and “staffing and work pressure”."
https://openalex.org/W3049444857,"We present normative data for an expanded set of stimuli designed to investigate past experience effects on object detection. The stimuli are vertically-elongated ""bipartite"" displays comprising two equal-area regions meeting at an articulated central border. When the central border is assigned to one side, a shaped figure (i.e., an object) is detected on that side. Participants viewing brief masked exposures typically detect figures more often on the critical side of Intact displays where a common (""familiar"") object is depicted than on a matched critical side of Part-Rearranged (PR) displays comprising the same parts arranged in novel configurations. This pattern of results showed that past experience in the form of familiar configuration rather than familiar parts is a prior for figure assignment. Spurred by research implicating a network involving the perirhinal cortex of the medial temporal lobe in these familiar configuration effects, we enlarged the stimulus set from 24 to 48 base stimuli to increase its usefulness for behavioral, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging experiments. We measured the percentage of participants who agreed on a single interpretation for each side of Intact, Upright PR, and Inverted PR displays (144 displays; 288 sides) under long exposure conditions. High inter-subject agreement is taken to operationally define a familiar configuration. This new stimulus set is well-suited to investigate questions concerning how parts and wholes are integrated and how high- and low-level brain areas interact in object detection. This set also allows tests of predictions regarding cross-border competition in figure assignment and assessments of individual differences. The displays, their image statistics, and normative data are available online (https://osf.io/j9kz2/)."
https://openalex.org/W3049544329,"The aim of the project was to investigate the effects of two strategies of teaching new sport actions on performance of eight-year-old children: observational-imitative method (OIM) and descriptive-directive method (DDM). The OIM group was provided with a pre-practice instruction in the form of expert modeling observation by an expert athlete. The DDM group received only verbal explanations of few selected static images. Thirty-six children (18 males and 18 females, mean age = 8,8) participated in the experiment. Subjects were randomly assigned to the OIM or DDM groups. Participants were instructed to perform four sport motor sequences never performed before (shoulder stand, soccer action, vortex howler throw, step action). Actions were videotaped and 2D kinematic analysis performed. A 10-point Likert questionnaire was administered to blind sport experts to assess the correctness and accuracy of each action. Results suggest that the OIM is the most effective instruction method when participants have no experience with the sport action to be performed. On the contrary, if the athlete needs to learn specific aspects of an exercise (such as grasping a tool) the best method is the DDM. In fact, detailed information on how to grab the vortex helped children in throwing it. We also found gender differences which might reflect cultural influences in specific sports (e.g. soccer). Finally, repetition of the exercise also improved the DDM group's performance. This has potential applications in sport teaching, suggesting that in the absence of a model performing the action to be imitated, the DDM can be as effective as the OIM if the observer repeats the sport action many times."
https://openalex.org/W3049562802,"Counterfactual thoughts center on how the past could have been different. Such thoughts may be differentiated in terms of direction of comparison, such that upward counterfactuals focus on how the past could have been better, whereas downward counterfactuals focus on how the past could have been worse. A key question is how such past-oriented thoughts connect to future-oriented individual differences such as optimism. Ambiguities surround a series of past studies in which optimism predicted relatively greater downward counterfactual thinking. Our main study (N = 1150) and six supplementary studies (N = 1901) re-examined this link to reveal a different result, a weak relation between optimism and upward (rather than downward) counterfactual thinking. These results offer an important correction to the counterfactual literature and are informative for theory on individual differences in optimism."
https://openalex.org/W3049228738,"Piano is a complex instrument, which humans learn to play after many years of practice. This paper investigates the complex dynamics of the embodied interactions between a human and piano, in order to gain insights into the nature of humans' physical dexterity and adaptability. In this context, the dynamic interactions become particularly crucial for delicate expressions, often present in advanced music pieces, which is the main focus of this paper. This paper hypothesises that the relationship between motor control for key-pressing and the generated sound is a manifold problem, with high-degrees of non-linearity in nature. We employ a minimalistic experimental platform based on a robotic arm equipped with a single elastic finger in order to systematically investigate the motor control and resulting outcome of piano sounds. The robot was programmed to run 3125 key-presses on a physical digital piano with varied control parameters. The obtained data was applied to a Gaussian Process (GP) inference modelling method, to train a network in terms of 10 playing styles, corresponding to different expressions generated by a Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI). By analysing the robot control parameters and the output sounds, the relationship was confirmed to be highly nonlinear, especially when the rich expressions (such as a broad range of sound dynamics) were necessary. Furthermore this relationship was difficult and time consuming to learn with linear regression models, compared to the developed GP-based approach. The performance of the robot controller was also compared to that of an experienced human player. The analysis shows that the robot is able to generate sounds closer to humans' in some expressions, but requires additional investigations for others."
https://openalex.org/W3049411500,"Advancements in statistical ecology offer the opportunity to gain further inferences from existing data with minimal financial cost. Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models extend traditional capture-recapture models to incorporate spatial position of capture and enable direct estimation of animal densities across a region of interest. The additional inferences provided are both ecologically interesting and valuable for decision making, which has resulted in traditional capture-recapture data being repurposed using SCR. Yet, many capture-recapture studies were not designed for SCR and the limitations of repurposing data from such studies are rarely assessed in practice. We used simulation to evaluate the robustness of SCR for retrospectively estimating large mammal densities over a variety of scenarios using repurposed capture-recapture data collected by an asymmetrical sampling grid and covering a broad spatial extent in a heterogenous landscape. We found performance of SCR models fit using repurposed data simulated from the existing grid was not robust, but instead bias and precision of density estimates varied considerably among simulations scenarios. For example, while the smallest relatives bias of density estimates was 3%, it ranged by 14 orders of magnitude among scenarios and was most strongly influenced by detection parameters. Our results caution against the casual repurposing of non-spatial capture-recapture data using SCR and demonstrate the importance of using simulation to assessing model performance during retrospective applications."
https://openalex.org/W3049502771,"Plant-derived fuels and chemicals from renewable biomass have significant potential to replace reliance on petroleum and improve global carbon balance. However, plant biomass contains significant fractions of oligosaccharides that are not usable natively by many industrial microorganisms, including Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zymomonas mobilis. Even after chemical or enzymatic hydrolysis, some carbohydrate remains as non-metabolizable oligosaccharides (e.g., cellobiose or longer cellulose-derived oligomers), thus reducing the efficiency of conversion to useful products. To begin to address this problem for Z. mobilis, we engineered a strain (Z. mobilis GH3) that expresses a glycosyl hydrolase (GH) with β-glucosidase activity from a related α-proteobacterial species, Caulobacter crescentus, and subjected it to an adaptation in cellobiose medium. Growth on cellobiose was achieved after a prolonged lag phase in cellobiose medium that induced changes in gene expression and cell composition, including increased expression and extracellular release of GH. These changes were reversible upon growth in glucose-containing medium, meaning they did not result from genetic mutation but could be retained upon transfer of cells to fresh cellobiose medium. After adaptation to cellobiose, our GH-expressing strain was able to convert about 50% of cellobiose to glucose within 24 h and use it for growth and ethanol production. Alternatively, pre-growth of Z. mobilis GH3 in sucrose medium enabled immediate growth on cellobiose. Proteomic analysis of cellobiose- and sucrose-adapted strains revealed upregulation of secretion-, transport-, and outer membrane-related proteins, which may aid release or surface display of GHs, entry of cellobiose into the periplasm, or both. Our two key findings are that Z. mobilis can be reprogrammed to grow on cellobiose as a sole carbon source and that this reprogramming is related to a natural response of Z. mobilis to sucrose that promotes sucrase production."
https://openalex.org/W3049626457,"DUF328 family proteins are present in many prokaryotes; however, their molecular activities are unknown. The Escherichia coli DUF328 protein YaaA is a member of the OxyR regulon and is protective against oxidative stress. Because uncharacterized proteins involved in prokaryotic oxidative stress response are rare, we sought to learn more about the DUF328 family. Using comparative genomics, we found a robust association between the DUF328 family and genes involved in DNA recombination and the oxidative stress response. In some proteins, DUF328 domains are fused to other domains involved in DNA binding, recombination, and repair. Cofitness analysis indicates that DUF328 family genes associate with recombination-mediated DNA repair pathways, particularly the RecFOR pathway. Purified recombinant YaaA binds to dsDNA, duplex DNA containing bubbles of unpaired nucleotides, and Holliday junction constructs in vitro with dissociation equilibrium constants of 200-300 nm YaaA binds DNA with positive cooperativity, forming multiple shifted species in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The 1.65-Å resolution X-ray crystal structure of YaaA reveals that the protein possesses a new fold that we name the cantaloupe fold. YaaA has a positively charged cleft and a helix-hairpin-helix DNA-binding motif found in other DNA repair enzymes. Our results demonstrate that YaaA is a new type of DNA-binding protein associated with the oxidative stress response and that this molecular function is likely conserved in other DUF328 family members."
https://openalex.org/W3049138881,"Umbrella trials have been suggested to increase trial conduct efficiency when investigating different biomarker-driven experimental therapies. An overarching platform is used for patient screening and subsequent subtrial allocation according to patients' biomarker status. Two subtrial allocation schemes for patients with a positive test result for multiple biomarkers are (i) the pragmatic allocation to the eligible subtrial with the currently fewest included patients and (ii) the random allocation to one of the eligible subtrials. Obviously, the subtrials compete for such patients which are consequently underrepresented in the subtrials. To address questions of the impact of an umbrella design in general as well as with respect to subtrial allocation and analysis method, we investigate an umbrella trial with two parallel group subtrials and discuss generalisations. First, we analytically quantify the impact of the umbrella design with random allocation on the number of patients needed to be screened, the biomarker status distribution and treatment effect estimates compared to the corresponding gold standard of an independent parallel group design. Using simulations and real data, we subsequently compare both allocation schemes and investigate weighted linear regression modelling as possible analysis method for the umbrella design. Our results show that umbrella designs are more efficient than the gold standard. However, depending on the biomarker status distribution in the disease population, an umbrella design can introduce differences in estimated treatment effects in the presence of an interaction between treatment and biomarker status. In principle, weighted linear regression together with the random allocation scheme can address this difference though it is difficult to assess if such an approach is applicable in practice. In any case, caution is required when using treatment effect estimates derived from umbrella designs for e.g. future trial planning or meta-analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2798430448,"The present paper proposes generalized Gaussian kernel adaptive filtering, where the kernel parameters are adaptive and data-driven. The Gaussian kernel is parametrized by a center vector and a symmetric positive definite (SPD) precision matrix, which is regarded as a generalization of the scalar width parameter. These parameters are adaptively updated on the basis of a proposed least-square-type rule to minimize the estimation error. The main contribution of this paper is to establish update rules for precision matrices on the SPD manifold in order to keep their symmetric positive-definiteness. Different from conventional kernel adaptive filters, the proposed regressor is a superposition of Gaussian kernels with all different parameters, which makes such regressor more flexible. The kernel adaptive filtering algorithm is established together with a l1-regularized least squares to avoid overfitting and the increase of dimensionality of the dictionary. Experimental results confirm the validity of the proposed method."
https://openalex.org/W3049351814,"High-flow low-expansion backfill materials have been developed to improve difficult slurry pipeline transport and poor roof-contact effect of many filling materials. The fly ash content was fixed at 80%, with 8.5% - 9.5% mineral powder content, 8.5% - 9.5% lime, 2% - 3% desulfurized gypsum, 0.9% - 1.2% sodium carbonate, and 0.01% - 0.02% aluminum powder content. The prepared backfill material processed good fluidity, with the expansion rate of the hardened material reaching 2% - 3%, and compressive strength on 90 d reaching 4 MPa-5.5 MPa. SEM observations indicated that as the aluminum content increased, ettringite on bubble walls transformed from a fine-needle to needle-rod shape. Secondly, the hydration products of the system were mainly hydrated calcium silicate gel and ettringite, which interconnected and promoted the formation of the structure. The backfill material has extensive sources of raw materials, low cost, simple filling process, and good filling effect."
https://openalex.org/W3049450900,"Response to simultaneous stressors is an important facet of plant ecology and land management. In a greenhouse trial, we studied how eight plant species responded to single and combined effects of three soil concentrations of the phytotoxic munitions constituent RDX and two levels of water-resourcing. In an outdoor trial, we studied the effects of high RDX soil concentration and two levels of water-resourcing in three plant species. Multiple endpoints related to RDX fate, plant health, and plant survival were evaluated in both trials. Starting RDX concentration was the most frequent factor influencing all endpoints. Water-resourcing also had significant impacts, but in fewer cases. For most endpoints, significant interaction effects between RDX concentration and water-resourcing were observed for some species and treatments. Main and interaction effects were typically variable (significant in one treatment, but not in another; associated with increasing endpoint values for one treatment and/or with decreasing endpoint values in another). This complexity has implications for understanding how RDX and water-availability combine to impact plants, as well as for applications like phytoremediation. As an additional product of these greenhouse and outdoor trials, three plants native or naturalized within the southeastern United States were identified as promising species for further study as in situ phytoremediation resources. Plumbago auriculata exhibited relatively strong and markedly consistent among-treatment mean proportional reductions in soil RDX concentrations (112% and 2.5% of the means of corresponding values observed within other species). Likewise, across all treatments, Salvia coccinea exhibited distinctively low variance in mean leaf chlorophyll content index levels (6.5% of the means of corresponding values observed within other species). Both species also exhibited mean wilting and chlorosis levels that were 66% and 35%, and 67% and 84%, of corresponding values observed in all other plants, respectively. Ruellia caroliniensis exhibited at least 43% higher mean survival across all treatments than any other test species in outdoor trials, despite exhibiting similar RDX uptake and bioconcentration levels."
https://openalex.org/W3049658389,"Compared to the integer-order modeling, the fractional-order modeling can achieve higher accuracy for designing and analyzing the DC-DC power converters. However, its applications in pulse width modulation (PWM) converters are limited due to the computational complexities. In this paper, a modified fractional-order modeling methodology for DC-DC converters is proposed, and its effectiveness is verified on the fractional-order positive Luo converters. Instead of using fractional-order calculus, the proposed methodology analyzes the harmonic components of the PWM converters by utilizing the non-linear vector differential equations of the periodically time-variant system. The final solution of the state variables is composed of two parts: the steady-state solution and the transient solution. The approximate steady state solution can be obtained by using the equivalent small parameter (ESP) method and the harmonic balance theory, while the main part of the transient solution can be obtained according to the explicit Grünwald-Letnikov (GL) approximation. In addition, the influence of the fractional orders on the performance of the DC-DC converters, and on the dynamic behaviors of the fractional-orders systems are also discussed in this paper. Compared to the conventional fractional-order numerical models, the proposed model is able to present the time-domain information more precisely, which helps to better reveal and analyze the non-linear behaviors of the DC-DC converters. The effectiveness of the work is demonstrated by the simulation and experimental results of the equivalent circuits built with fractional-order components."
https://openalex.org/W3049102233,"In high malaria transmission settings, the use of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine-based intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP) has resulted in decreased antibody (Ab) levels to VAR2CSA. However, information of Ab levels in areas of low or intermediate malaria transmission after long-term implementation of IPTp-SP is still lacking. The present study sought to evaluate antibody prevalence and levels in women at delivery in Etoudi, a peri-urban area in the capital of Yaoundé, Cameroon, that is a relatively low-malaria transmission area. Peripheral plasma samples from 130 pregnant women were collected at delivery and tested for IgG to the full-length recombinant VAR2CSA (FV2) and its most immunogenic subdomain, DBL5. The study was conducted between 2013 and 2015, approximately ten years after implementation of IPTp-SP in Cameroon. About 8.6% of the women attending the clinic had placental malaria (PM). One, two or 3 doses of SP did not impact significantly on either the percentage of women with Ab to FV2 and DBL5 or Ab levels in Ab-positive women compared to women not taking SP. The prevalence of Ab to FV2 and DBL5 was only 36.9% and 36.1%, respectively. Surprisingly, among women who had PM at delivery, only 61.5% and 57.7% had Ab to FV2 and DBL5, respectively, with only 52.9% and 47.1% in PM-positive paucigravidae and 77.7% of multigravidae having Ab to both antigens. These results suggest that long-term implementation of IPTp-SP in a low-malaria transmission area results in few women having Ab to VAR2CSA."
https://openalex.org/W3049597102,"Planning and execution are two important parts of the problem-solving process. Based on related research, it is expected that planning speed and execution speed are positively correlated because of underlying individual differences in general mental speed. While there could also be a direct negative dependency of execution time on planning time, given the hypothesis that an investment in planning contributes to more efficient execution. The positive correlation and negative dependency are not contradictory since the former is a relationship across individuals (at the latent variable level) and the latter is a relationship within individuals (at the manifest variable level) after controlling for across-individual relationships. With two linear mixed model analyses and a factor model analysis, these two different kinds of relationships were examined using dependency analysis. The results supported the above hypotheses. The correlation between the latent variables of planning and execution was found to be positive and the dependency of execution time on planning time was found to be negative in all analyses. Moreover, the negative dependency varied among items and to some extent among persons as well. In summary, this study provides a clearer picture of the relationship between planning and execution and suggests that analyses at different levels may reveal different relationships."
