https://openalex.org/W2005208156,"Some future gravitational-wave antennas will be cylinders of mass approximately 100 kilograms, whose end-to-end vibrations must be measured so accurately (10(-19) centimeter) that they behave quantum mechanically. Moreover, the vibration amplitude must be measured over and over again without perturbing it (quantum nondemolition measurement). This contrasts with quantum chemistry, quantum optics, or atomic, nuclear, and elementary particle physics, where one usually makes measurements on an ensemble of identical objects and does not care whether any single object is perturbed or destroyed by the measurement. This article describes the new electronic techniques required for quantum nondemolition measurements and the theory underlying them. Quantum nondemolition measurements may find application elsewhere in science and technology."

The insertion site of the lux transposon was the nahG gene encoding for salicylate hydroxylase. Luciferasemediated light production from P. fluorescens strains harboring this plasmid was induced on exposure to naphthalene or the regulatory inducer metabolite, salicylate. In continuous culture, light induction was rapid (15 minutes) and was highly responsive to dynamic changes in naphthalene exposure. Strains harboring pUTK21 were responsive to aromatic hydrocarbon contamination in Manufactured Gas Plant soils and produced sufficient light to serve as biosensors of naphthalene exposure and reporters of naphthalene biodegradative activity. The robust and sensitive nature of the bioluminescent reporter technology suggests that new sensing methods can be developed for on-line process monitoring and control in complex environmental matrices."
https://openalex.org/W2132082727,"Climate control of nutricline depth in the equatorial Atlantic can be monitored by variations in the abundance of the phytoplankton species Florisphaera profunda. A conceptual model, based on in situ evidence, associates high abundances of F. profunda with a deep nutricline and low abundances with a shallow nutricline. A 200,000-year record of F. profunda relative abundances, obtained from a deep-sea core sited beneath the region of maximum equatorial divergence at 10 degrees W, has 52 percent of its variance centered on the 23,000-year precessional band. Cross-spectral analysis between the signals of F. profunda and sea-surface temperature, independently derived from zooplankton species, shows their 23,000-year cycles to be coherent and nearly in phase. Abundance minima of F. profunda coincide with times of December perihelion, whereas abundance maxima coincide with June perihelion. These relations indicate that nutricline dynamics in the divergence region of the equatorial Atlantic are controlled by variations in the tropical easterlies, forced by the precessional component of orbital insolation, on time scales greater than 10,000 years."

These wave trains are interpreted as fault zone-trapped seismic modes. Parkfield earthquakes exciting trapped modes have been located as deep as 10 kilometers, as shallow as 4 kilometers, and extend 12 kilometers along the fault on either side of the recording station. Selected Oroville and Parkfield wave forms are modeled as the fundamental and first higher trapped SH modes of a narrow low-velocity layer at the fault. Modeling results suggest that the Oroville fault zone is 18 meters wide at depth and has a shear wave velocity of 1 kilometer per second, whereas at Parkfield, the fault gouge is 100 to 150 meters wide and has a shear wave velocity of 1.1 to 1.8 kilometers per second. These low-velocity layers are probably the rupture planes on which earthquakes occur."

https://openalex.org/W2083977527,"The transition of the Somali Current from northeast monsoon conditions to southwest monsoon conditions was observed from April through August 1979. The northeastward flow associated with the Somali Current of the southwest monsoon progressed from the equator in April to 4 degrees N in August. The separation of the current from the coast, as observed at the northern boundary of the northeastward flow, did not intrude north continuously, but rather in distinct steps. South of 4 degrees N, the circulation was characterized by the incorporation of increasing amounts of somewhat more saline water from the south and east into the boundary current. A clockwise gyre with northeastward flow along the coast developed between 6 degrees and 10 degrees N during June."

https://openalex.org/W2003161160,On July 24 1980 The Carter Administration issued the Global 2000 Report prepared by the Council on Environmental Quality and the Department State with the assistance of 11 other agencies. The report depicted a gloomy future for the world by the year 2000. Based on current projections by the year 2000 the disparities between the rich and the poor will be greater than they are now. The gap between the per capita gross national product for the developing countries and the developed countries will grow from $4000-$7900 from 1975-2000. Per capita petroleum resources will decline by more than 50% and the per capita water supply will decrease by 35%. Desertification and deforestation will create serious problems. The real price of food and energy will increase respectively by 100% and 150% by the year 2000. The report did not provide recommendations for confronting these problems; however Gus Speth the chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality was asked by President Carter to head a task force for the purpose of developing policy recommendations. Apparently Speth plans to formulate specific recommendations to deal with each problem instead of calling for major overall shifts in basic government policy. In contrast the North-South Report recently issued by an international commission headed by Willy Brandt called for major economic policy changes. The report called on countries to greatly increase their developmental aid expenditures and to drastically cut their defense expenditures. The Carter Administration is currently studying the North-South report but in view of the countrys current concern about its defense system it is unlikely that Carter will act on the report.

https://openalex.org/W2083524436,"Copper, largely in the mineral chalcocite, is found in the lowermost beds of the Nonesuch shale over many square miles near White Pine, Ontonagon County, Mich. The Nonesuch shale, of late Keweenawan age, is about 600 feet thick and is composed largely of gray siltstone. It overlies 2,300 to 5,500 feet of red sandstones and conglomerates, the Copper Harbor conglomerate. This formation, in turn, overlies the middle Keweenawan Portage Lake lava series, in which occur the famous native-copper deposits of the south shore of Lake Superior. The White Pine mine is 45 to 70 miles west-southwest of the principal native copper mines.The copper-bearing beds at White Pine are primarily in the lower 20to 25 feet of the Nonesuch shale. This cupriferous zone is divided in local usage into four stratigraphic units, which are, in ascending order, the lower sandstone (the uppermost bed of the Copper Harbor conglomerate), the parting shale, the upper sandstone, and the upper shale. The sequence of beds is almost identical in the upper and parting shales, suggesting cyclic sedimentation. This sequence and the distribution of sedimentary facies are attributed to two submergences, separated by an emergence, of a deltaic area.Practically all the copper occurs in the upper and parting shales, except in a small area near the White Pine fault where it is abundant in the upper and lower sandstones. It is present in five different layers in amounts that average from 1 to 3 percent. The total amount of copper in each bed is generally higher where the bed is thick, and thickness, in turn, seems to be greatest in areas that were hollows away from the main channel or channels of the ancient delta. Copper content of the shale beds typically decreases as their sand content increases. The extent of individual copper-bearing beds 1 to 3 feet thick is measurable in square miles.The local occurrence of copper in the upper and lower sandstone beds can be reasonably explained as the result of hydrothermal transportation from the White Pine fault up the dip of the relatively permeable sandstone to the crest of an adjacent anticline. Distribution of copper in the parting and upper shales, on the other hand, seems to be completely independent of local structure, faults, and rock permeability. For the area as a whole the control is lithologic and stratigraphic. Probably the copper was dropped into or precipitated within the original mud; it may conceivably have replaced with exquisite detail something else that was so deposited."
