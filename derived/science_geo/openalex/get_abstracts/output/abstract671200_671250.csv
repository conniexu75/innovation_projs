https://openalex.org/W3141891109,"Objectives Existing literature on how employment loss affects depression has struggled to address potential endogeneity bias caused by reverse causality. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique natural experiment because the source of unemployment is very likely to be exogenous to the individual. This study assessed the effect of job loss and job furlough on the mental health of individuals in South Africa during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data and methods The data for the study came from the first and second waves of the national survey, the National Income Dynamics-Coronavirus Rapid Mobile Survey (NIDS-CRAM), conducted during May-June and July-August 2020, respectively. The sample for NIDS-CRAM was drawn from an earlier national survey, conducted in 2017, which had collected data on mental health. Questions on depressive symptoms during the lockdown were asked in Wave 2 of NIDS-CRAM, using a 2-question version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). The PHQ-2 responses (0–6 on the discrete scale) were regrouped into four categories making the ordered logit regression model the most suited for assessing the impact of employment status on depressive symptoms. Results The study revealed that adults who retained paid employment during the COVID-19 lockdown had significantly lower depression scores than adults who lost employment. The benefits of employment also accumulated over time, underscoring the effect of unemployment duration on mental health. The analysis revealed no mental health benefits to being furloughed (on unpaid leave), but paid leave had a strong and significant positive effect on the mental health of adults. Conclusions The economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented job losses, which impaired mental wellbeing significantly. Health policy responses to the crisis therefore need to focus on both physical and mental health interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3141280895,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genotyped with arrays, have become a widely used marker type in population genetic analyses over the last 10 years. However, compared to whole genome re-sequencing data, arrays are known to lack a substantial proportion of globally rare variants and tend to be biased towards variants present in populations involved in the development process of the respective array. This affects population genetic estimators and is known as SNP ascertainment bias. We investigated factors contributing to ascertainment bias in array development by redesigning the Axiom ™ Genome-Wide Chicken Array in silico and evaluating changes in allele frequency spectra and heterozygosity estimates in a stepwise manner. A sequential reduction of rare alleles during the development process was shown. This was mainly caused by the identification of SNPs in a limited set of populations and a within-population selection of common SNPs when aiming for equidistant spacing. These effects were shown to be less severe with a larger discovery panel. Additionally, a generally massive overestimation of expected heterozygosity for the ascertained SNP sets was shown. This overestimation was 24% higher for populations involved in the discovery process than not involved populations in case of the original array. The same was observed after the SNP discovery step in the redesign. However, an unequal contribution of populations during the SNP selection can mask this effect but also adds uncertainty. Finally, we make suggestions for the design of specialized arrays for large scale projects where whole genome re-sequencing techniques are still too expensive."

Yet, their benefits are often questioned by the population and the level of adherence to the measures is variable. We examined in representative samples across eight countries ( N = 7,568) whether adherence reported around June 1, 2020 predicted the increase in Covid-19 mortality by August 31, 2020. Mortality increased 81.3% in low adherence countries (United States, Sweden, Poland, Russia), 8.4% in high adherence countries (Germany, France, Spain, United Kingdom). Across countries adherence and subsequent mortality increases correlated with r = -0.91. No African or South American countries were included in the present study, which limits the generalizability of the findings. While reported Covid-19 mortality is likely to be influenced by other factors, the almost tenfold difference in additional mortality is significant, and may inform decisions when choosing whether to prioritize individual liberty rights or health-protective measures."
https://openalex.org/W3133079835,"Background and objective Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an on-going epidemic with a multitude of long-ranging effects on the physiological balance of the human body. It can cause several effects on thyroid functions as well. We aimed to assess the lasting sequelae of COVID-19 on thyroid hormone and the clinical course of the disease as a result. Methods Out of 76 patients, 48 patients of COVID-19 positive and 28 patients of COVID-19 negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were assessed for thyroid functions, IL-6, and Procalcitonin between moderate, severe, and critical pneumonia on HRCT. Results Seventy-five percent of patients with COVID-19 had thyroid abnormalities and higher IL-6 levels (76.10 ± 82.35 vs. 6.99 ± 3.99, 95% CI 52.18–100.01, P-value &lt;0.01). Logistic regression analysis suggested TT3 (P-value 0.01), IL-6 (P-value &lt;0.01), and Procalcitonin (P-value 0.03) as independent risk factors for COVID-19. ROC curve demonstrated IL-6 as the most sensitive marker (P-value &lt;0.01), and TT3, and Procalcitonin as the predictor for COVID-19 disease. Conclusion This pilot study from Pakistan demonstrates that changes in serum TSH and TT3 levels may be important manifestations of the courses of COVID-19 pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3091724813,"Background In dealing with community spread of COVID-19, two active interventions have been attempted or advocated—containment, and mitigation. Given the extensive impact of COVID-19 globally, there is international interest to learn from best practices that have been shown to work in controlling community spread to inform future outbreaks. This study explores the trajectory of COVID-19 infection in Singapore had the government intervention not focused on containment, but rather on mitigation. In addition, we estimate the actual COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore, given that confirmed cases are publicly available. Methods and findings We developed a COVID-19 infection model, which is a modified SIR model that differentiate between detected (diagnosed) and undetected (undiagnosed) individuals and segments total population into seven health states: susceptible (S), infected asymptomatic undiagnosed (A), infected asymptomatic diagnosed (I), infected symptomatic undiagnosed (U), infected symptomatic diagnosed (E), recovered (R), and dead (D). To account for the infection stages of the asymptomatic and symptomatic infected individuals, the asymptomatic infected individuals were further disaggregated into three infection stages: (a) latent (b) infectious and (c) non-infectious; while the symptomatic infected were disaggregated into two stages: (a) infectious and (b) non-infectious. The simulation result shows that by the end of the current epidemic cycle without considering the possibility of a second wave, under the containment intervention implemented in Singapore, the confirmed number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic cases) is projected to be 52,053 (with 95% confidence range of 49,370–54,735) representing 0.87% (0.83%-0.92%) of the total population; while the actual number of Singaporeans infected with COVID-19 (diagnosed and undiagnosed asymptomatic and symptomatic infected cases) is projected to be 86,041 (81,097–90,986), which is 1.65 times the confirmed cases and represents 1.45% (1.36%-1.53%) of the total population. A peak in infected cases is projected to have occurred on around day 125 (27/05/2020) for the confirmed infected cases and around day 115 (17/05/2020) for the actual infected cases. The number of deaths is estimated to be 37 (34–39) among those infected with COVID-19 by the end of the epidemic cycle; consequently, the perceived case fatality rate is projected to be 0.07%, while the actual case fatality rate is estimated to be 0.043%. Importantly, our simulation model results suggest that there about 65% more COVID-19 infection cases in Singapore that have not been captured in the official reported numbers which could be uncovered via a serological study. Compared to the containment intervention, a mitigation intervention would have resulted in early peak infection, and increase both the cumulative confirmed and actual infection cases and deaths. Conclusion Early public health measures in the context of targeted, aggressive containment including swift and effective contact tracing and quarantine, was likely responsible for suppressing the number of COVID-19 infections in Singapore."
https://openalex.org/W3145141719,"Based on combined data from the China Patent Database, China Industrial Enterprise Database, and China Customs Import and Export Database for the period 2004–2010, this study investigates the impact of heterogeneous environmental regulations on the export technological sophistication of manufacturing enterprises. Given deepening international market segmentation of production and the increasing proportion of intermediate trade, and compared with the traditional method based on exports, the export technological sophistication calculated here, based on value-added, is closer to the true level. Since there has been no in-depth comparative study on the relationship between heterogeneous environmental regulation and export technological sophistication, this study fills the gap. The results show that all three regulation types bear a U-shaped impact on export technological sophistication. Command-control regulation exhibits a restraining effect on mixed trade, eastern, and foreign-funded enterprises. Market-incentive regulation promotes processing and mixed trade enterprises as well as domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. Voluntary-participation regulation promotes all enterprises with different trade patterns and ownership. The mechanism analysis shows that command-control and market-participation environmental regulations affect export technological sophistication through the green invention and green utility innovation channels, while, additionally, market-incentive environmental regulation affects export technological sophistication through the green design innovation channel. Considering the environmental governance issues, the policy implications for enhancing the entire industrial chain and enterprises’ export competitiveness are clear. Due to the unclear functions and powers of competent departments and a rigid threshold, command-control regulation is not conducive to cleaner production technology and the promotion of enterprises’ export competitiveness; it should thus be discouraged. Although both market-incentive and voluntary-participation regulations have promoted cleaner production technology and enterprises’ competitiveness significantly, the environmental tax system requires continuous improvement. The government should continue to raise public involvement in environmental protection to enrich the channels and forms of environmental management."
https://openalex.org/W3142002785,"“Principal Component Analysis” (PCA) is an established linear technique for dimensionality reduction. It performs an orthonormal transformation to replace possibly correlated variables with a smaller set of linearly independent variables, the so-called principal components, which capture a large portion of the data variance. The problem of finding the optimal number of principal components has been widely studied for offline PCA. However, when working with streaming data, the optimal number changes continuously. This requires to update both the principal components and the dimensionality in every timestep. While the continuous update of the principal components is widely studied, the available algorithms for dimensionality adjustment are limited to an increment of one in neural network-based and incremental PCA. Therefore, existing approaches cannot account for abrupt changes in the presented data. The contribution of this work is to enable in neural network-based PCA the continuous dimensionality adjustment by an arbitrary number without the necessity to learn all principal components. A novel algorithm is presented that utilizes several PCA characteristics to adaptivly update the optimal number of principal components for neural network-based PCA. A precise estimation of the required dimensionality reduces the computational effort while ensuring that the desired amount of variance is kept. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is investigated and it is benchmarked in an experimental study against other neural network-based and incremental PCA approaches where it produces highly competitive results."
https://openalex.org/W3149155580,"Global warming is predicted to result in upslope shifts in the elevational ranges of bird species in montane habitats. Yet few studies have examined changes over time in the elevational distribution of species along fragmented gradients in response to global warming. Here, we report on a resurvey of an understory bird community in the Usambara Mountains in Tanzania, along a forested elevational gradient that has been fragmented over the last 200 years. In 2019, we resurveyed seven sites, ranging in elevation from 360 m to 2110 m, that were originally surveyed between 1979 and 1981. We calculated differences in mean elevation and lower and upper range limits for 29 species between the two time periods and corrected for possible differences in elevation due to chance. Over four decades, we documented a significant mean upslope shift across species of 93 m. This shift was smaller than the 125 m expected shift due to local climate warming. Of the 29 focal species, 19 shifted upslope, eight downslope, and two remained unchanged. Mean upslope shifts in species were driven largely by contracting lower range limits which moved significantly upslope on average across species by 183 m, while upper range limits shifted non-significantly upslope by 72 m, leading to a mean range contraction of 114 m across species. Community composition of understory bird species also shifted over time, with current communities resembling communities found historically at lower elevations. Past forest fragmentation in combination with the limited gap-crossing ability of many tropical understory bird species are very likely important contributory factors to the observed asymmetrical shifts in lower and upper elevational range limits. Re-establishing forested linkages among the largest and closest forest fragments in the Eastern Arc Mountains are critical to permitting species to shift upslope and to reduce further elevational range contractions over time."
https://openalex.org/W3143808558,"The leaf equivalent water thickness (EWT, g cm −2 ) and fuel moisture content (FMC, %) are key variables in ecological and environmental monitoring. Although a variety of hyperspectral vegetation indices have been developed to estimate the leaf EWT and FMC, most of these indices are defined considered two or three specific bands for a specific plant species, which limits their applicability. In this study, we proposed three new spectral absorption indices (SAI 970 , SAI 1200 , and SAI 1660 ) for various plant types by considering the symmetry of the spectral absorption at 970 nm, 1200 nm and 1660 nm and spectral heterogeneity of different leaves. The indices were calculated considering the absorption peak and shoulder bands of each leaf instead of the same specific bands for all leaves. A pooled dataset of three tree species (camphor (VX), capricorn (VJ), and red-leaf plum (VL)) was used to test the performance of the SAIs in terms of the leaf EWT and FMC estimation. The results indicated that, first, SAI 1200 was more suitable for estimating the EWT than FMC, whereas SAI 970 and SAI 1660 were more suitable for estimating the FMC. Second, SAI 1200 achieved the most accurate estimation of the EWT with a cross-validation coefficient of determination ( R cv 2 ) of 0.845 and relative cross-validation root mean square error ( rRMSE cv ) of 8.90%. Third, SAI 1660 outperformed the other indices in estimating the FMC at the leaf level, with an R cv 2 of 0.637 and rRMSE cv of 8.56%. Fourth, SAI 970 achieved a moderate accuracy in estimating the EWT ( R cv 2 of 0.25 and rRMSE cv of 19.68%) and FMC ( R cv 2 of 0.275 and rRMSE cv of 12.10%) at the leaf level. These results can enrich the application of the SAIs and demonstrate the potential of using SAI 1200 to determine the leaf EWT and SAI 1660 to obtain the leaf FMC among various plant types."
https://openalex.org/W3151728914,"Since the word2vec model was proposed, many researchers have vectorized the data in the research field based on it. In the field of social network, the Node2Vec model improved on the basis of word2vec can vectorize nodes and edges in social networks, so as to carry out relevant research on social networks, such as link prediction, and community division. However, social network is a network with homogeneous structure. When dealing with heterogeneous networks such as knowledge graph, Node2Vec will lead to inaccurate prediction and unreasonable vector quantization data. Specifically, in the Node2Vec model, the walk strategy for homogeneous networks is not suitable for heterogeneous networks, because the latter has distinguishing features for nodes and edges. In this paper, a Heterogeneous Network vector representation method is proposed based on random walks and Node2Vec, called KG2vec (Heterogeneous Network to Vector) that solves problems related to the inadequate consideration of the full-text semantics and the contextual relations that are encountered by the traditional vector representation of the knowledge graph. First, the knowledge graph is reconstructed and a new random walk strategy is applied. Then, two training models and optimizing strategies are proposed, so that the contextual environment between entities and relations is obtained, semantically providing a full vector representation of the Heterogeneous Network. The experimental results show that the KG2VEC model solves the problem of insufficient context consideration and unsatisfactory results of one-to-many relationship in the vectorization process of the traditional knowledge graph. Our experiments show that KG2vec achieves better performance with higher accuracy than traditional methods."
https://openalex.org/W3151891324,"Synthetic lethality is a successful strategy employed to develop selective chemotherapeutics against cancer cells. Inactivation of RAD52 is synthetically lethal to homologous recombination (HR) deficient cancer cell lines. Replication protein A (RPA) recruits RAD52 to repair sites, and the formation of this protein-protein complex is critical for RAD52 activity. To discover small molecules that inhibit the RPA:RAD52 protein-protein interaction (PPI), we screened chemical libraries with our newly developed Fluorescence-based protein-protein Interaction Assay (FluorIA). Eleven compounds were identified, including FDA-approved drugs (quinacrine, mitoxantrone, and doxorubicin). The FluorIA was used to rank the compounds by their ability to inhibit the RPA:RAD52 PPI and showed mitoxantrone and doxorubicin to be the most effective. Initial studies using the three FDA-approved drugs showed selective killing of BRCA1-mutated breast cancer cells (HCC1937), BRCA2-mutated ovarian cancer cells (PE01), and BRCA1-mutated ovarian cancer cells (UWB1.289). It was noteworthy that selective killing was seen in cells known to be resistant to PARP inhibitors (HCC1937 and UWB1 SYr13). A cell-based double-strand break (DSB) repair assay indicated that mitoxantrone significantly suppressed RAD52-dependent single-strand annealing (SSA) and mitoxantrone treatment disrupted the RPA:RAD52 PPI in cells. Furthermore, mitoxantrone reduced radiation-induced foci-formation of RAD52 with no significant activity against RAD51 foci formation. The results indicate that the RPA:RAD52 PPI could be a therapeutic target for HR-deficient cancers. These data also suggest that RAD52 is one of the targets of mitoxantrone and related compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3145214542,"Few studies have investigated fathers’ roles in child care in Madagascar. This study explored the perceptions, attitudes, and practices regarding fathers’ involvement in child care using qualitative methods. Ten focus group discussions were conducted among parents of children aged 6–23 months; seven were among mothers, and three among fathers. In-depth semi-structured interviews (n = 8) were also conducted with key informants. Discussions and interviews were audio-recorded and the verbatim transcripts in Malagasy were translated into English. Data were analyzed using the thematic analysis approach. Provision of financial and material support as well as teaching and playing with the child were the main perceived roles of fathers. In practice, fathers spent their time alone with their children playing and holding them when the mother was unavailable. Busy schedules and separation due to work were major barriers to fathers’ involvement. Traditional gender roles for child care in which the mother is seen as primarily responsible for the child were salient across the data. Consequently, men involved in child care activities and their wives were often criticized by the community. Nevertheless, there was self-reported interest from both mothers and fathers in involving men more in child care. Interventions aimed to increase fathers’ involvement in child care may be more successful when they focus on shifting the community perceptions on the division of responsibilities between fathers and mothers."
https://openalex.org/W3147023537,"Background While motorcycles are essential for moving people and goods, they are also, a significant contributor to Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs), making it a public health issue of concern globally. The Hohoe Municipal Hospital records increasing RTAs due to commercial motorcycles. Determining motorcycle riders’ compliance with road safety regulations is critical in helping to curb this menace. Method A cross-sectional study was employed involving a multistage sample of 238 motorcycle riders. Data were collected using a pretested structured questionnaire and entered into Epi Data version 3.2 software and exported to STATA software version 12 for analysis. Descriptive and inferential analyses were done while statistical significance was determined at 95% reliability interval and p-value of 0.05. Findings The level of compliance with road safety regulations among respondents was 59.2%. The mean age of respondents was 29.9 ± 7.9 years, and all respondents were males. Respondents who did not own their motorbikes were 0.39 times less likely to comply with road safety regulations compared to their counterparts who owned one, while those without alternate occupations were 0.51times less likely to comply with road safety regulations compared to those with an additional occupation. Those aged between 30–39 years and 40–49 years were 2.37 and 4.1 times more likely to comply with road safety regulations, respectively, compared to those aged ≤29 years, and those who did not smoke were 3.15 times more likely to comply with road safety regulations than those who smoked. Conclusion Compliance to safety regulations are fairly low and although motorcycle usage on a commercial basis is yet to be legalised in Ghana, routine education targeting riders who smoke, do not have alternate occupations, do not own motorbikes and younger riders will improve their compliance. Also, riders should be encouraged to obtain their license from the appropriate authorities."
https://openalex.org/W3150877790,"The red fox is a highly adaptable mammal that has established itself world-wide in many different environments. Contributing to its success is a social structure based on chemical signalling between individuals. Urine scent marking behaviour has long been known in foxes, but there has not been a recent study of the chemical composition of fox urine. We have used solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to analyze the urinary volatiles in 15 free-ranging wild foxes (2 female) living in farmlands and bush in Victoria, Australia. Foxes here are routinely culled as feral pests, and the urine was collected by bladder puncture soon after death. Compounds were identified from their mass spectra and Kovats retention indices. There were 53 possible endogenous scent compounds, 10 plant-derived compounds and 5 anthropogenic xenobiotics. Among the plant chemicals were several aromatic apocarotenoids previously found in greater abundance in the fox tail gland. They reflect the dietary consumption of carotenoids, essential for optimal health. One third of all the endogenous volatiles were sulfur compounds, a highly odiferous group which included thiols, methylsulfides and polysulfides. Five of the sulfur compounds (3-isopentenyl thiol, 1- and 2-phenylethyl methyl sulfide, octanethiol and benzyl methyl sulfide) have only been found in foxes, and four others (isopentyl methyl sulfide, 3-isopentenyl methyl sulfide, and 1- and 2-phenylethane thiol) only in some canid, mink and skunk species. This indicates that they are not normal mammalian metabolites and have evolved to serve a specific role. This role is for defence in musteloids and most likely for chemical communication in canids. The total production of sulfur compounds varied greatly between foxes (median 1.2, range 0.4–32.3 μg ‘acetophenone equivalents’/mg creatinine) as did the relative abundance of different chemical types. The urinary scent chemistry may represent a highly evolved system of semiochemicals for communication between foxes."

https://openalex.org/W3140262342,"This study aimed to estimate the incidence of KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF mutations in the Moroccan population, and investigate the associations of KRAS and NRAS gene mutations with clinicopathological characteristics and their prognosis value. To achieve these objectives, we reviewed medical and pathology reports for 210 patients. RAS testing was investigated by Sanger sequencing and Pyrosequencing technology. BRAF (exon 15) status was analyzed by the Sanger method. The expression of MMR proteins was evaluated by Immunohistochemistry. KRAS and NRAS mutations were found in 36.7% and 2.9% of 210 patients, respectively. KRAS exon 2 mutations were identified in 76.5% of the cases. RAS-mutated colon cancers were significantly associated with female gender, presence of vascular invasion, classical adenocarcinoma, moderately differentiated tumors, advanced TNM stage III-IV, left colon site, higher incidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnostic, microsatellite stable phenotype, lower number of total lymph nodes, and higher means of positive lymph nodes and lymph node ratio. KRAS exon 2-mutated colon cancers, compared with KRAS wild-type colon cancers were associated with the same clinicopathological features of RAS-mutated colon cancers. NRAS-mutated patients were associated with lower total lymph node rate and the presence of positive lymph node. Rare RAS-mutated tumors, compared with wild-type tumors were more frequently moderately differentiated and associated with lower lymph node rate. We found that KRAS codon 13-mutated, tumors compared to codon 12-mutated tumors were significantly correlated with a higher death cases number, a lower rate of positive lymph, lower follow-up time, and poor overall survival. Our findings show that KRAS and NRAS mutations have distinct clinicopathological features. KRAS codon 13-mutated status was the worst predictor of prognosis at all stages in our population."
https://openalex.org/W3140849179,"Wildlife-related accidents, especially deer-vehicle accidents, pose a serious problem for road safety and animal protection in many countries. Knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns of deer-vehicle accidents is inevitable for accident analysis and mitigation efforts with temporal deer-vehicle accident data being much more difficult to obtain in sufficient data quality. We described the temporal patterns of roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) roadkills occurring in the period 2002-2006 in southeastern Austria. Using a comprehensive dataset, consisting of 11.771 data points, we examined the influence of different time units (i.e. season, month, day of week, day of year), illumination categories (coarse and fine temporal resolution) and lunar phases on deer-vehicle accidents by performing linear and generalized additive models. Thereby, we identified peak accident periods within the analyzed time units. Highest frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents occurred in November, May and October, on Fridays, and during nights. Relationships between lunar phases and roe deer-vehicle accidents were analysed, providing evidence for high frequencies of deer-vehicle accidents during full moon phases. We suggest that deer-vehicle accidents are dependent both on human activity in traffic and wildlife activity, which is in turn affected by phenology, intra- and interspecific competition, climatic and astronomical events. Our results highlight, that short-term mitigation measures (e.g. traffic controls and speed limits) can be highly effective to reduce deer-vehicle accidents, but should be flexibly adapted to specific temporal periods."
https://openalex.org/W3141026955,"Strontium isotope ( 87 Sr/ 86 Sr) analysis of human skeletal remains is an important method in archaeology to examine past human mobility and landscape use. 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures of a given location are largely determined by the underlying bedrock, and these geology specific isotope signatures are incorporated into skeletal tissue through food and water, often permitting the differentiation of local and non-local individuals in past human populations. This study presents the results of a systematic survey of modern flora and fauna (n = 100) from 14 locations to map the bioavailable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr signatures of the Conchucos region, an area where the extent of geologic variability was previously unknown. We illustrate the necessity to examine the variation in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of the different geological formations available to human land use to document the range of possible local 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values. Within the Conchucos region we found significant variation in environmental 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values (0.7078–0.7214). The resulting isoscape represents the largest regionally specific bioavailable 87 Sr/ 86 Sr map (3,840 km 2 ) to date for the Andes, and will serve as a baseline for future archaeological studies of human mobility in this part of the Peruvian highlands."

(L. rhinocerotis) is a medicinal mushroom traditionally used in the treatment of asthma and several other diseases by the indigenous communities in Malaysia. In this study, the effects of L. rhinocerotis on allergic airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness were investigated. L. rhinocerotis extract (LRE) was prepared by hot water extraction using soxhlet. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) study was performed in house dust mite (HDM)-induced asthma in Balb/c mice while airway inflammation study was performed in ovalbumin (OVA)-induced asthma in Sprague-Dawley rats. Treatment with different doses of LRE (125, 250 and 500 mg/kg) significantly inhibited AHR in HDM-induced mice. Treatment with LRE also significantly decreased the elevated IgE in serum, Th2 cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and ameliorated OVA-induced histological changes in rats by attenuating leukocyte infiltration, mucus hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia in the lungs. LRE also significantly reduced the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in BALF. Interestingly, a significant reduction of the FOXP3+ regulatory T lymphocytes was observed following OVA induction, but the cells were significantly elevated with LRE treatment. Subsequent analyses on gene expression revealed regulation of several important genes i.e. IL17A, ADAM33, CCL5, IL4, CCR3, CCR8, PMCH, CCL22, IFNG, CCL17, CCR4, PRG2, FCER1A, CLCA1, CHIA and Cma1 which were up-regulated following OVA induction but down-regulated following treatment with LRE. In conclusion, LRE alleviates allergy airway inflammation and hyperresponsiveness, thus suggesting its therapeutic potential as a new armamentarium against allergic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W3144214258,"Semi-natural grasslands occupy large parts of the European landscape but little information exists about seasonal variations in their nutritive value during the growing season. This paper presents results of novel data showing the effect of 13 years of previous contrasting management intensities on herbage nutritional value in relation to different dates of first defoliation (by grazing or haymaking). The treatments were: extensive management and intensive management from previous years (1998–2011). Both treatments were cut in June followed by intensive/extensive grazing for the rest of the grazing season (July–October). To evaluate forage quality in the first defoliation date, biomass sampling was performed in the year 2012 for 23 weeks from May to mid-October, and in 2013 for seven weeks from May to mid-June. Sampling was performed from plots that were not under management during the sampling year. Previous extensive management was associated with significantly reduced forage quality for in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD), crude protein, neutral detergent fibre, acid detergent fibre and reduced divalent cations (Ca, Mg) and Na during the first seven weeks of the grazing season and the forage was suitable only for beef cattle. Due to low forage IVOMD, the forage is suitable only for cattle maintenance or for low quality hay when the start of grazing was postponed from seven weeks of vegetative growth to 13 weeks, regardless of the previous intensity. Herbage harvested after 13 weeks of the grazing season was of very low quality and was unsuitable as a forage for cattle when it was the only source of feed. Agri-environmental payments are necessary to help agricultural utilisation to maintain semi-natural grasslands by compensating for deterioration of forage quality, not only for the postponement of the first defoliation (either as cutting or grazing) after mid-June, but also when extensive management is required."

Multilevel regression analysis showed that ventilator-associated pneumonia (OR = 2.034, 95%CI: 1.256, 3.296, p = 0.004), pressure injuries (OR = 2.202, 95%CI: 1.258, 3.852, p = 0.006), number of comorbidities (OR = 1.076, 95%CI: 1.016,1.140, p = 0.013) and adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index score (OR = 1.210, 95%CI: 1.090, 1.343, p<0.001) were associated with an increased risk of mortality, while undergoing surgery with general anaesthesia (OR = 0.582, 95%CI: 0.368, 0.920, p = 0.021) was associated with a decreased risk of mortality.The identification of risk factors associated with mortality is an important step towards individualizing care plans. Our findings may help healthcare workers select high-risk patients for specific interventions. Further study is needed to explore whether appropriate interventions against modifiable risk factors, such as reduced immobility complications or ventilator-associated pneumonia, could improve the prognoses."
https://openalex.org/W3148722418,"The learned helplessness (LH) model is one of the most commonly used acute stress models to explain depression and it has shown good face and predictive validity. However, despite being able to induce depressed-like behaviors and corresponding psychophysiological changes, there is little evidence showing that the LH paradigm can produce anhedonia, a core symptom seen in all forms of depression in humans. So far a couple of studies showed that rodents bred for helplessness develop anhedonic-like behaviors in response to stress; yet, to the best of our knowledge, no similar human research has tried to investigate the direct relationship between the LH model and anhedonia. In the present study, we use a modified version of the original LH task to experimentally and temporarily induce learned helplessness in college students and then examine if the human LH paradigm induces anhedonia. We aim to 1: address the ill-defined connection between the LH model and anhedonia, and 2: directly assess helplessness in humans as opposed to the majority of non-human animal subjects used in the helplessness literature. We believe that our study will fill an important gap in the learned helplessness model literature, and will advance our understanding of the relationship between depression and perceived control, as well as place limitations to what can and cannot be inferred from non-human animal data in this topic."
https://openalex.org/W3148785549,"Aggressive high-grade, estrogen receptor negative (ER-) breast cancer is more common among American women of African ancestry (AA) than those of European ancestry (EA). Epigenetic mechanisms, particularly DNA methylation and altered microRNA (miRNA) expression, may contribute to racial differences in breast cancer. However, few studies have specifically characterized genome-wide DNA methylation-based modifications at the miRNA level in relation to ER+ and ER- subtype, and their functional role in the regulation of miRNA expression, especially among high risk AA women. In this study, we evaluated DNA methylation patterns of miRNA encoding genes and their effect on expression in breast tumors from both AA and EA women. The genome-wide methylation screen identified a total of 7,191 unique CpGs mapped to 1,292 miRNA genes, corresponding to 2,035 unique mature miRNAs. We identified differentially methylated loci (DMLs: (|delta β|)>0.10, FDR<0.05) between ER- and ER+ tumor subtypes, including 290 DMLs shared in both races, 317 and 136 were specific to AA and EA women, respectively. Integrated analysis identified certain DMLs whose methylation levels were significantly correlated with the expression of relevant miRNAs, such as multiple CpGs within miR-190b and miR-135b highly negatively correlated with their expression. These results were then validated in the TCGA dataset. Target prediction and pathway analysis showed that these DNA methylation-dysregulated miRNAs are involved in multiple cancer-related pathways, including cell cycle G1-S growth factor regulation, cytoskeleton remodeling, angiogenesis, EMT, and ESR1-mediated signaling pathways. In summary, our results suggest that DNA methylation changes within miRNA genes are associated with altered miRNA expression, which may contribute to the network of subtype- and race-related tumor biological differences in breast cancer. These findings support the involvement of epigenetic regulation of miRNA expression and provide insights into the relations of clinical-relevant miRNAs to their target genes, which may serve as potential preventative and therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W3103684317,"Income inequality is known to have negative impacts on an economic system, thus has been debated for a hundred years past or more. Numerous ideas have been proposed to quantify income inequality, and the Gini coefficient is a prevalent index. However, the concept of perfect equality in the Gini coefficient is rather idealistic and cannot provide realistic guidance on whether government interventions are needed to adjust income inequality. In this paper, we first propose the concept of a more realistic and 'feasible' income equality that maximizes total social welfare. Then we show that an optimal income distribution representing the feasible equality could be modeled using the sigmoid welfare function and the Boltzmann income distribution. Finally, we carry out an empirical analysis of four countries and demonstrate how optimal income distributions could be evaluated. Our results show that the feasible income equality could be used as a practical guideline for government policies and interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3147375748,"Compared to emblematic large carnivores, most species of the order Carnivora receive little conservation attention despite increasing anthropogenic pressure and poor understanding of their status across much of their range. We employed systematic camera trapping and spatially explicit capture-recapture modelling to estimate variation in population density of serval, striped hyaena and aardwolf across the mixed-use Ruaha-Rungwa landscape in southern Tanzania. We selected three sites representative of different habitat types, management strategies, and levels of anthropogenic pressure: Ruaha National Park’s core tourist area, dominated by Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets; the Park’s miombo woodland; and the neighbouring community-run MBOMIPA Wildlife Management Area, also covered in Acacia-Commiphora . The Park’s miombo woodlands supported a higher serval density (5.56 [Standard Error = ±2.45] individuals per 100 km 2 ) than either the core tourist area (3.45 [±1.04] individuals per 100 km 2 ) or the Wildlife Management Area (2.08 [±0.74] individuals per 100 km 2 ). Taken together, precipitation, the abundance of apex predators, and the level of anthropogenic pressure likely drive such variation. Striped hyaena were detected only in the Wildlife Management Area and at low density (1.36 [±0.50] individuals per 100 km 2 ), potentially due to the location of the surveyed sites at the edge of the species’ global range, high densities of sympatric competitors, and anthropogenic edge effects. Finally, aardwolf were captured in both the Park’s core tourist area and the Wildlife Management Area, with a higher density in the Wildlife Management Area (13.25 [±2.48] versus 9.19 [±1.66] individuals per 100 km 2 ), possibly as a result of lower intraguild predation and late fire outbreaks in the area surveyed. By shedding light on three understudied African carnivore species, this study highlights the importance of miombo woodland conservation and community-managed conservation, as well as the value of by-catch camera trap data to improve ecological knowledge of lesser-studied carnivores."
https://openalex.org/W3147543085,"The estimation of the entropy of a random system or process is of interest in many scientific applications. The aim of this article is the analysis of the entropy of the famous Kumaraswamy distribution, an aspect which has not been the subject of particular attention previously as surprising as it may seem. With this in mind, six different entropy measures are considered and expressed analytically via the beta function. A numerical study is performed to discuss the behavior of these measures. Subsequently, we investigate their estimation through a semi-parametric approach combining the obtained expressions and the maximum likelihood estimation approach. Maximum likelihood estimates for the considered entropy measures are thus derived. The convergence properties of these estimates are proved through a simulated data, showing their numerical efficiency. Concrete applications to two real data sets are provided."

https://openalex.org/W3121812926,"The association between prolong metformin usage and B12 deficiency has been documented. However, the prevalence estimates of metformin-induced vitamin B12 deficiency showed substantial disparity among studies due to varied study definitions of vitamin B12 deficiency. Metformin blocks the calcium dependent absorption of the vitamin B12-Intrinsic Factor complex at the terminal ileum. Lack of intrinsic factor due to the presence of auto-antibodies to parietal cells (IFA) could lead to vitamin B12 deficiency and subsequently cause peripheral neuropathy. We investigated the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency using more sensitive, combined markers of vitamin B12 status (4cB12) and the immuno-biochemical mediators of vitamin B12 deficiency.In this observational study, 200 consecutive consenting metformin-treated T2DM patients, aged 35 and above, attending the diabetic clinic at KATH were recruited. Vitamin B12 deficiency was classified based on the Fedosov age-normalized wellness quotient. Anthropometric measurement was taken as well as blood samples for immunological and biochemical mediators. Peripheral neuropathy was assessed using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (MNSI). Statistical analysis was performed using the R Language for Statistical Computing.Using the combined indicator (4cB12), the prevalence of metformin induced vitamin B12 deficiency was 40.5% whilst the prevalence of MNSI-Q and MNSI-PE diabetic neuropathy was 32.5% and 6.5% respectively. Participants with vitamin B12 deficiency had significantly higher levels of IFA, GPA, TNF-α, TC, LDL and albumin compared to those with normal vitamin B12 levels (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant negative association between 4cB12 and the immunological markers [IFA (rs = -0.301, p<0.0001), GPA (rs = -0.244, p = 0.001), TNF-α (rs = -0.242, p = 0.001) and IL-6 (rs = -0.145, p = 0.041)]. Likewise, 4cB12 was negatively associated with TC (rs = -0.203, p = 0.004) and LDL (rs = -0.222, p = 0.002) but positively correlated with HDL (rs = 0.196, p = 0.005).Vitamin B12 deficiency and diabetic neuropathy are very high among metformin-treated T2DM patients and it is associated with increased GPA, IFA, TNF-α and cardiometabolic risk factors (higher LDL and TC and lower HDL). Upon verification of these findings in a prospective case-control study, it may be beneficial to include periodic measurement of Vitamin B12 using the more sensitive combined indicators (4cB 12) in the management of patients with T2DM treated with metformin in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3140489778,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The major bacterial cause of COPD exacerbations is non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). 25 to over 80% of cases are associated with NTHi. This susceptibility to infection involves a defective production of interleukin (IL)-22 which plays an important role in mucosal defense. Prophylactic administration of flagellin, a Toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5) agonist, protects healthy mice against respiratory pathogenic bacteria. We hypothesized that TLR5-mediated stimulation of lung immunity might prevent COPD exacerbations. Mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke (CS), which presented COPD symptoms, were infected with NTHi and intraperitoneally treated with recombinant flagellin following a prophylactic or therapeutic protocol. Compared with control, cigarette smoke-exposed mice treated with flagellin showed a lower bacterial load in the airways, the lungs and the blood. This protection was associated with an early neutrophilia, a lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and an increased IL-22 production. Flagellin treatment decreased the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the lung damages related to exacerbation. Morover, the protective effect of flagellin against NTHi was altered by treatment with anti-IL-22 blocking antibodies in cigarette smoke-exposed mice and in Il22 -/- mice. The effect of flagellin treatment did not implicated the anti-bacterial peptides calgranulins and defensin-β2. This study shows that stimulation of innate immunity by a TLR5 ligand is a potent antibacterial treatment in CS-exposed mice, suggesting innovative therapeutic strategies against acute exacerbation in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W3141175481,"Hyaline membrane disease (HMD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm newborn babies. Though, there are studies related to Hyaline membrane disease inclusive of all neonates, studies related to the burden among preterm neonates were limited. In addition, increasing neonatal mortality in Ethiopia could be related to increase in the burden of hyaline membrane disease among preterm neonates. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the burden of hyaline membrane disease, mortality and its associated factors among preterm neonate admitted at neonatal intensive care unit, North Central Ethiopia.An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 535 preterm neonates admitted at neonatal intensive care unit from January 1, 2014-December 30, 2017. Data were entered into EPi-data 4.2.0.0 and transferred to STATA version 14 statistical software for statistical analysis. Binary logistic regression was used for the analysis. All variables with P-value < 0.25 during bi-variable analysis were considered for multivariable logistic regression. Level of statistical significance was declared at P value ≤0.05.In the current study, proportion of hyaline membrane disease was 40% (95% CI; 35.8, 44.3) of which 49.5% died. Preterm neonate born with Gestational age of less than 34 weeks of age (Adjusted odd ratio (AOR = 2.64; 95 CI: 1.49, 4.66)), 5th minute Apgar score less than 7 (AOR = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.20, 4.07), and newborn with birth weight of less than 1500 gram (AOR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3, 4.3) were predictors of hyaline membrane disease.The mean gestational age (±) was 33.46 (±2.55) weeks. The incidence of hyaline membrane disease among preterm admissions was high. Preterm neonate born with gestational age of less than 34 weeks of age, asphyxiated newborns and newborn with birth weight of less than 1500 gram were predictors of hyaline membrane disease. So, emphasis should be given on early screening, follow up and timely interventions for preterm neonate."
https://openalex.org/W3143002541,"Background Combustible cigarettes have detrimental effects on periodontal disease. However, little evidence is available regarding new heated tobacco product (HTP) use and combined product use (both combustible cigarettes and HTPs). This study aimed to examine the association of combustible cigarettes, HTPs, and combined product use with periodontal disease simultaneously. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study was conducted using data from the 2019 arm of the longitudinal Japan “Society and New Tobacco” Internet Survey. Combustible cigarette users, HTP users, combined product users, never-users, and former users’ data were separately obtained. In the present study, the primary outcome was self-reported periodontal disease. We estimated adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) and confidence intervals (CIs) using multivariable modified Poisson regression analysis after adjusting for 12 confounders. Results Of the 10,439 JASTIS respondents, the numbers of users of combustible cigarettes only, HTPs only, and both products were 1,304, 437, and 1,049, respectively. Compared with never-users, HTP use was significantly associated with the prevalence of self-reported periodontal diseases (PR 1.43, 95% CI 1.03–1.62). Moreover, former users, combustible cigarette users, and combined product users also showed significant associations (PR 1.56, 95% CI 1.35–1.80; PR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03–1.62; and PR 1.55, 95% CI 1.20–1.99, respectively). Conclusions Users of HTPs, combustible cigarettes, and combined products as well as former users were all significantly associated with a higher prevalence of periodontal diseases compared to never-users."

Little is known about web 2.0 such as social networking sites (SNS) and instant messaging (IM) and experiences of HISBs.We surveyed representative Hong Kong Chinese adults (N = 10143, 54.9% female; 72.3% aged 25-64 years) on frequency of HISBs using traditional sources, internet websites, SNS (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and IM (e.g., WhatsApp, WeChat) and experiences measured using Information Seeking Experience Scale. Adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) for HISBs and experiences by sociodemographic and health-related characteristics were yielded using multivariable Poisson regression with robust variance estimators. aPRs for experiences by HISBs using internet websites, SNS, and IM adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics were also yielded.Being female, higher educational attainment, not smoking, and being physically active were associated with HISBs using any source (all P<0.05). Older age had decreased aPRs for HISBs using traditional sources (P for trend = 0.03), internet websites (P for trend<0.001), and SNS (P for trend<0.001) but not for IM (aged 45-64 years: aPR = 1.48, 95% CI 1.07, 2.03). Lower educational attainment and income were associated with negative experiences including feelings of effort and difficulties in understanding the information (all P for trend<0.05). Older age had increased aPRs for difficulties in understanding the information (P for trend = 0.003). Compared with internet websites, HISBs using IM was associated with feelings of frustration (aPR = 1.39, 95% CI 1.08, 1.79), difficulties in understanding the information (aPR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.12, 1.65), and quality concern (aPR = 1.20, 95% CI 1.08, 1.32).We identified correlates of web-based health information seeking and experiences in Hong Kong Chinese adults. Providing greater access to and improved information environment of web 2.0 to the target groups may help address digital inequalities."

Nowadays, although increasing the number of sEMG measurement positions and extracting more features are common methods to increase the accuracy of grasp force estimation, it will increase the computational burden. In this paper, an approach based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN) for optimal measurement positions and features is proposed, with the purpose of using fewer measurement positions or features to achieve higher estimation accuracy. Firstly, we captured six channels of sEMG from subjects’ forearm and grasp force synchronously. Then, four kinds of features in time domain are extracted from each channel of sEMG. By combining different measurement position sets (MPSs) and feature set (FSs), we construct 945 data sets. These data sets are fed to GRNN to realize grasp force estimation. Normalized root mean square error (NRMS), normalized mean of absolute error (NMAE), and correlation coefficient (CC) between estimated grasp force and actual force are introduced to evaluate the performance of grasp force estimation. Finally, ANOVA and Tukey HSD testing are introduced to analyze grasp force estimation results so as to obtain the optimal measurement positions and features. We obtain the optimal MPSs for grasp force estimation when different FSs are employed, and the optimal FSs when different MPSs are utilized."
https://openalex.org/W3148210330,"The protein POT1 ( P rotection o f T elomeres 1) is an integral part of the shelterin complex that protects the ends of human chromosomes from degradation or end fusions. It is the only component of shelterin that binds single-stranded DNA. We describe here the application of two separate fluorescent thermal shift assays (FTSA) that provide quantitative biophysical characterization of POT1 stability and its interactions. The first assay uses Sypro Orange™ and monitors the thermal stability of POT1 and its binding under a variety of conditions. This assay is useful for the quality control of POT1 preparations, for biophysical characterization of its DNA binding and, potentially, as an efficient screening tool for binding of small molecule drug candidates. The second assay uses a FRET-labeled human telomeric G-quadruplex structure that reveals the effects of POT1 binding on thermal stability from the DNA frame of reference. These complementary assays provide efficient biophysical approaches for the quantitative characterization of multiple aspects of POT1 structure and function. The results from these assays provide thermodynamics details of POT1 folding, the sequence selectivity of its DNA binding and the thermodynamic profile for its binding to its preferred DNA binding sequence. Most significantly, results from these assays elucidate two mechanisms for the inhibition of POT1 –DNA interactions. The first is by competitive inhibition at the POT1 DNA binding site. The second is indirect and is by stabilization of G-quadruplex formation within the normal POT1 single-stranded DNA sequence to prevent POT1 binding."
https://openalex.org/W3141500000,"Trade agreements are thought to raise trade integration, but existing preferential trade agreements (PTAs) are insufficient in measuring market access of products. This study develops a product-based coverage index of PTAs using the World Trade Organization (WTO) preferential trade agreements and calculates bilateral trade measures using the EORA multi-regional input-output (MRIO) tables covering 189 countries worldwide over the period 1990-2015; the structural gravity model is employed to test how PTAs affect bilateral trade. Our findings show that countries sharing a common PTA could boost the trade volume compared to those without PTAs, supporting the trade creation effect. However, the trade promotion effect of the product-based coverage index of PTAs is significant only if the member countries are low-and middle-income countries. Further, the wide range of product liberalization brought by PTAs can promote global production networks by stimulating the trade of intermediate goods. Our results are important for understanding the market access effect of PTAs with the increasing development of trade integration and global value chains (GVCs)."
https://openalex.org/W3148079437,"Global warming is predicted to exert negative impacts on plant growth due to the damaging effect of high temperatures on plant physiology. Revealing the genetic architecture underlying the heat stress response is therefore crucial for the development of conservation strategies, and for breeding heat-resistant plant genotypes. Here we investigated the transcriptional changes induced by heat in Nothofagus pumilio , an emblematic tree species of the sub-Antarctic forests of South America. Through the performance of RNA-seq of leaves of plants exposed to 20°C (control) or 34°C (heat shock), we generated the first transcriptomic resource for the species. We also studied the changes in protein-coding transcripts expression in response to heat. We found 5,214 contigs differentially expressed between temperatures. The heat treatment resulted in a down-regulation of genes related to photosynthesis and carbon metabolism, whereas secondary metabolism, protein re-folding and response to stress were up-regulated. Moreover, several transcription factor families like WRKY or ERF were promoted by heat, alongside spliceosome machinery and hormone signaling pathways. Through a comparative analysis of gene regulation in response to heat in Arabidopsis thaliana , Populus tomentosa and N. pumilio we provide evidence of the existence of shared molecular features of heat stress responses across angiosperms, and identify genes of potential biotechnological application."
https://openalex.org/W3152287990,"Biome conservatism is often regarded as common in diversifying lineages, based on the detection of low biome shift rates or high phylogenetic signal. However, many studies testing biome conservatism utilise a single-biome-per-species approach, which may influence the detection of biome conservatism. Meta-analyses show that biome shift rates are significantly lower (less than a tenth), when single biome occupancy approaches are adopted. Using New Zealand plant lineages, estimated biome shifts were also significantly lower (14–67% fewer biome shifts) when analysed under the assumption of a single biome per species. Although a single biome approach consistently resulted in lower biome shifts, it detected fewer instances of biome conservatism. A third of clades (3 out of 9) changed status in biome conservatism tests between single and multiple biome occupancy approaches, with more instances of significant biome conservatism when using a multiple biome occupancy approach. A single biome approach may change the likelihood of finding biome conservatism because it assumes biome specialisation within species, falsely recognises some biome shift types and fails to include other biome shift types. Our results indicate that the degree of biome fidelity assumed has a strong influence on analyses assessing biome shift rates, and biome conservatism testing. We advocate analyses that allow species to occupy multiple biomes."
https://openalex.org/W3139893717,"Research shows that retrospective memory is often more extreme than in-the-moment experiences. While investigations into this phenomenon have mostly focused on distinct, one-time experiences, we examined it with respect to recurring day-to-day experiences in the eating domain, focusing on variables of the snapshot model—i.e., the most intense and the final experience. We used a smartphone-based Ecological Momentary Assessment to assess the food intake and eating happiness of 103 participants (82.52% female, M age = 21.97 years) over eight days, and then calculated their best (positive peak), worst (negative peak) and final experiences. Remembered eating happiness was assessed immediately after the study (immediate recall) and after four weeks (delayed recall). A significant memory-experience gap was revealed at immediate recall ( d = .53). Remembered eating happiness was predicted by the worst eating experience (β = .41, p &lt; .001), but not by the best or final eating experience. Analyzing changes over time did not show a significant memory-experience gap at delayed recall, but did reveal a similar influence of the worst eating experience (β = .39, p &lt; .001). Findings indicate that, in the domain of eating, retrospective memory is mainly influenced by negative experiences. Overall, the results indicate that the snapshot model is a valid conceptualization to explain recall of both outstanding and day-to-day experiences."

Given that the dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways are involved in the etiology of psychiatric disease, this study evaluated the genetic association of dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) and serotonin transporter (SLC6A4) genes with psychiatric symptom susceptibility among HD patients. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) was used to assess anxiety and depressive symptoms among patients (n = 265). Genetic polymorphisms of DRD4 (48 bp VNTR) and SLC6A4 (5-HTTLPR VNTR and rs25531) were examined using a conventional polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique, as appropriate. Significant differences were observed in the distribution of 5-HTTLPR genotypes, SLC6A4 tri-allelic-phased genotype, and DRD4-Exon III VNTR genotypes/alleles between patients with anxiety symptoms versus those with normal/borderline conditions (p<0.05). Binary logistic regression analyses showed that the heterozygous 4,5 VNTR genotype of DRD4 was associated with a higher risk of anxiety symptoms after adjusting for other covariates (odds ratio = 4.25, p = 0.028). None of the studied polymorphisms was linked to depression in HD patients. Collectively, the current findings provide genetic clues to psychopathology in HD patients and suggest that the DRD4 exon III VNTR polymorphism is involved in the etiology of anxiety in this patient population."
https://openalex.org/W3144329388,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease affecting 1% of the world population. RA is associated with the presence of autoantibodies, of which anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) are most prominent. ACPA are produced by citrullinated antigen-binding B cells that have presumably survived tolerance checkpoints. So far, it is unclear how and when such autoreactive B cells emerge. Light chain (LC) rearrangement and mutation rates can be informative with regard to selection steps during B-cell development. Therefore, we studied LC characteristics of ACPA-expressing B cells and secreted ACPA with the aim to better understand the development of this disease-specific, autoreactive B-cell response. Paired ACPA-IgG and ACPA-depleted IgG were isolated from serum (n = 87) and synovial fluid (SF, n = 21) of patients with established RA. We determined the LC composition for each fraction by ELISA using kappa(Igκ)- and lambda(Igλ) LC-specific antibodies. Cellular LC expression was determined using flow cytometry. In addition, we used a B-cell receptor (BCR)-specific PCR to obtain LC variable region sequences of citrullinated antigen- and tetanus toxoid (TT)-binding B cells. In serum, we observed an increased frequency of lambda LC in ACPA-IgG (1.64:1) compared to control IgG (2.03:1) and to the κ/λ ratio reported for healthy individuals (2:1). A similar trend towards higher frequencies of lambda LCs was observed for ACPA-IgG in SF (1.84:1). Additionally, the percentage of Igλ-expressing B cells was higher for citrullinated antigen-binding B cells (51%) compared to TT-specific (43%) and total CD19 + CD20 + B cells (36%). Moreover, an increased Igλ percentage was observed in BCR-sequences derived from ACPA-expressing (49%) compared to TT-specific B cells (34%). Taken together, we report an enhanced frequency of lambda LCs in the secreted ACPA-IgG repertoire and, on the cellular level, in BCR sequences of ACPA-expressing B cells compared to control. This skewing in the autoreactive B-cell repertoire could reflect a process of active selection."

Herein, we report the first structural and kinetic characterization of a novel alkyl diamine N-hydroxylase DesB from Streptomyces sviceus (SsDesB). This enzyme catalyzes the first committed step in the biosynthesis of desferrioxamine B, a clinical drug used to treat iron overload disorders. X-ray crystal structures of the SsDesB holoenzyme with FAD and the ternary complex with bound NADP+ were solved at 2.86 Å and 2.37 Å resolution, respectively, providing a structural view of the active site environment. SsDesB crystallized as a tetramer and the structure of the individual protomers closely resembles the structures of homologous N-hydroxylating FMOs from Erwinia amylovora (DfoA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PvdA), and Aspergillus fumigatus (SidA). Using NADPH oxidation, oxygen consumption, and product formation assays, kinetic parameters were determined for various substrates with SsDesB. SsDesB exhibited typical saturation kinetics with substrate inhibition at high concentrations of NAD(P)H as well as cadaverine. The apparent kcat values for NADPH in steady-state NADPH oxidation and oxygen consumption assays were 0.28 ± 0.01 s-1 and 0.24 ± 0.01 s-1, respectively. However, in product formation assays used to measure the rate of N-hydroxylation, the apparent kcat for NADPH (0.034 ± 0.008 s-1) was almost 10-fold lower under saturating FAD and cadaverine concentrations, reflecting an uncoupled reaction, and the apparent NADPH KM was 33 ± 24 μM. Under saturating FAD and NADPH concentrations, the apparent kcat and KM for cadaverine in Csaky assays were 0.048 ± 0.004 s-1 and 19 ± 9 μM, respectively. SsDesB also N-hydroxylated putrescine, spermidine, and L-lysine substrates but not alkyl (di)amines that were branched or had fewer than four methylene units in an alkyl chain. These data demonstrate that SsDesB has wider substrate scope compared to other well-studied ornithine and lysine N-hydroxylases, making it an amenable biocatalyst for the production of desferrioxamine B, derivatives, and other N-substituted products."
https://openalex.org/W3148750384,"Citizen science programs can be powerful drivers of knowledge and scientific understanding and, in recent decades, they have become increasingly popular. Conducting successful research with the aid of citizen scientists often rests on the efficacy of a program’s outreach strategies. Program evaluation is increasingly recognized as a critical practice for citizen science practitioners to ensure that all efforts, including outreach, contribute to the overall goals of the program. The Peregrine Fund’s American Kestrel Partnership (AKP) is one such citizen science program that relies on outreach to engage participants in effective monitoring of a declining falcon species. Here, we examine whether various communication strategies were associated with desired outreach goals of the AKP. We demonstrate how social media, webcams, discussion boards, and newsletters were associated with perception of learning, agreement with our conservation messaging, and participation in our box monitoring program. Our results thus help us to improve our outreach methodology, suggest areas where other citizen science programs might improve their outreach efforts, and highlight future research priorities."

It is, therefore, critical to establish region-specific reference values in order to inform clinical decision-making.We analyzed data from a prospective observational HIV incidence cohort study in Kombewa, Kenya. Study participants were healthy males and females, aged 18-35 years, without HIV. Median and 95% reference values (2.5th percentile to 97.5th percentile) were calculated for laboratory parameters including hematology, chemistry studies, and CD4 T cell count. Standard Deviation Ratios (SDR) and Bias Ratios (BR) are presented as measures of effect magnitude. Findings were compared with those from the United States and other Kenyan studies.A total of 299 participants were analyzed with a median age of 24 years (interquartile range: 21-28). Ratio of males to females was 0.9:1. Hemoglobin range (2.5th-97.5th percentiles) was 12.0-17.9 g/dL and 9.5-15.3 g/dL in men and women respectively. In the cohort, MCV range was 59-95fL, WBC 3.7-9.2×103/μL, and platelet 154-401×103/μL. Chemistry values were higher in males; the creatinine RI was 59-103 μmol/L in males vs. 46-76 μmol/L in females (BRUL>.3); and the alanine transferase range was 8.8-45.3 U/L in males vs. 7.5-36.8 U/L in females (SDR>.3). The overall CD4 T cell count RI was 491-1381 cells/μL. Some parameters including hemoglobin, neutrophil, creatinine and ALT varied with that from prior studies in Kenya and the US.This study not only provides clinical reference intervals for a population in Kisumu County but also highlights the variations in comparable settings, accentuating the requirement for region-specific reference values to improve patient care, scientific validity, and quality of clinical trials in Africa."
https://openalex.org/W3141168514,"The Swiss Alpine environments are poorly described from a microbiological perspective. Near the Greina plateau in the Camadra valley in Ticino (southern Swiss Alps), a green-turquoise-coloured water spring streams off the mountain cliffs. Geochemical profiling revealed naturally elevated concentrations of heavy metals such as copper, lithium, zinc and cadmium, which are highly unusual for the geomorphology of the region. Of particular interest, was the presence of a thick biofilm, that was revealed by microscopic analysis to be mainly composed of Cyanobacteria. A metagenome was further assembled to detail the genes found in this environment. A multitude of genes for resistance/tolerance to high heavy metal concentrations were indeed found, such as, various transport systems, and genes involved in the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). EPS have been evoked as a central component in photosynthetic environments rich in heavy metals, for their ability to drive the sequestration of toxic, positively-charged metal ions under high regimes of cyanobacteria-driven photosynthesis. The results of this study provide a geochemical and microbiological description of this unusual environment in the southern Swiss Alps, the role of cyanobacterial photosynthesis in metal resistance, and the potential role of such microbial community in bioremediation of metal-contaminated environments."
https://openalex.org/W3145448013,"Prey size selection in some bird species is determined by the size of the beak. However, we assumed for bird species swallowing whole prey that a cognitive process may be involved. As cognitive feature, brain mass was used. We hypothesized that the mass of the brain was more strongly positively correlated with prey size than morphological features such as beak volume, gizzard mass and body mass. We tested this hypothesis on eiders Somateria mollissima that swallow the prey whole, by using mean and maximum size of nine prey categories. Eiders were collected at the main wintering grounds in Denmark. As index of brain mass we used head volume, which is positively correlated with brain mass (r2 = 0.73). Head volume of eiders was significantly, positive correlated with mean and maximum size of blue mussels Mytilus edulis, razor clams Ensis directus and all prey sizes combined and the maximum size of draft whelk Hinia reticulata and conch Buccinum undatum. Gizzard mass was also significantly positively correlated with maximum size of draft whelk and conch. Beak volume and body mass was not significantly correlated with the size of any of the nine food items. Analyses of effect size for organs showed that head volume was positively related to prey size, whereas beak volume, gizzard mass and body mass did not show a significant positive relationship. These results indicate that cognitive processes connected to brain mass may be involved in prey size selection by eiders."
https://openalex.org/W3148797809,"Ethiopia launched free access for antiretroviral therapy in 2005. The number of patients on second line antiretroviral treatment has increased with each passing year. The objectives of this study were to describe the clinical, immunological and virologic outcomes of children and adolescents receiving second line anti-retroviral therapy in two referral hospitals, Yekatit 12 and Zewditu Memorial Hospitals, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.This was a hospital based retrospective cohort study conducted among children and adolescents aged 18 years and less and receiving a second line antiretroviral drugs. Data was collected using structured questionnaires. Means and percentages were used for nominal variables. Statistical analysis was made using statistical software-SPSS 23.0. Kaplan Meier analysis, long rank test and multivariate Cox proportion model were used to identify factors affecting survival.A total of 75 children and adolescents were studied with a mean age of 13.28 years (SD: 4) with a mean treatment period on second line regimens of 35.2 months (SD: 21.8 months). Forty-eight participants were experiencing successful measures (in all three parameters) for their second line anti-retroviral treatment. Ten had virologic treatment failure while seven had died. Both treatment failure and death rates were higher within the first two years of treatment. Poor treatment adherence (Adjusted hazard ratio: 5.1 (95% CI: 1.1-23.2; p-value = 0.02)) and advanced World Health Organization clinical stage at start of the second line antiretrovirals (Adjusted hazard ratio: 7.51 (95% CI: 1.35-18.02; p-value = 0.002)) correlated significantly with survival of children and adolescents receiving treatment.The study describes clinical, immunological and virologic outcomes of second line antiretroviral treatment in a pediatric cohort under care in two hospitals in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Poor adherence and pre-treatment advanced clinical stages were predictors of survival."
https://openalex.org/W3149328040,"Governmental measures aiming at social protection, with components of disease control, have potential positive impacts in the nutritional and health outcomes of the beneficiaries. The concomitant presence of these measures with environmental sanitation interventions may increase their positive effect. The context of simultaneous improvement of social protection and environmental sanitation is found in Brazil since 2007 and an assessment of the combined effects of both programs has not been performed so far.To evaluate whether interaction effects between improvement of access to water, sanitation and solid waste collection with the Bolsa Família Program [PBF] were related to better responses in the reduction of morbidity due to diarrhea and malnutrition in children less than five years of age, acknowledging the positive results of these improved conditions and the PBF separately in coping with these diseases.Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed through Generalized Linear Models of the Negative Binomial type of fixed effects, with and without addition of zeros. Interaction models were inserted in order to evaluate the outcomes when the two public policies of interest in the current study were present simultaneously in the municipalities.Interaction with negative effect when a concomitantly high municipal coverage of the Bolsa Família Program and adequate access to sanitation and solid waste collection were present. In contrast, regardless of municipal coverage by the PBF, the simultaneous presence of water and sanitation (0.028% / 0.019%); water and solid waste collection (0.033% / 0.014%); sanitation and solid waste collection (0.018% / 0.021%), all resulted in a positive effect, with a decrease in the average morbidity rates for both diseases.Investments aimed at universalizing water, sanitation and solid waste collection services should be priorities, aiming at reducing the incidence of morbidity due to malnutrition and diarrhea and preventing deaths from these poverty-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3149349986,"In this paper, we investigate the outage probability and ergodic sum capacity of the downlink of the integrated satellite-terrestrial networks (ISTN) with a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (CNOMA) scheme, in which a user with better channel condition acts as a relay node and forwards information to the other users. In this paper, a pilot-based channel estimation method is considered which can verify the performance of this scheme with the imperfect channel state information. In this model, all these users are equipped with multi-antennas, and all of them are both in the coverage of a same beam of the satellite. Specifically, the exact analytical expression for the outage probability and ergodic sum capacity of the system is derived. The result shows that this coordinated non-orthogonal multiple access (CNOMA) scheme performs better than that of OMA (TDMA) in this model. Finally, the future research directions are given to further enhance the system capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3149993337,"Considering the high clinical and forensic relevance of pharmaco-adherence during lisdexamphetamine (LDX) treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the aim here was to evaluate hair analysis as a tool for monitoring compliance in patients currently undergoing long term treatment with LDX, by detecting possible interruptions of medication intake or changes in dosage. For this purpose, a total of 24 patients from an outpatient clinic for ADHD were recruited. Hair and urine samples were taken after three consecutive therapy sessions over a 7-month period and analyzed for amphetamine (AMP) enantiomers and other drugs, using chiral and achiral liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Participants also provided information on the condition of their hair, the consumption of illegal psychotropic substances and the regularity of taking LDX. Two participants withdrew from the study early. Urine analyses were positive for D-AMP in all urine samples and therapy sessions, except in two patients who did not take LDX on a daily basis. D-AMP was detected in all hair samples; however, no correlation was found between prescribed dose/day and D-AMP concentrations in proximal hair segments. Qualitative interpretation of hair analysis showed that 18 of the 22 study completers were compliant concerning the intake of LDX without additional consumption of illegal D,L-AMP. Analysis of urine taken during the therapy sessions showed no correlation between D-AMP concentrations and prescribed dosage, with or without normalization for creatinine. In conclusion, chiral LC-MS/MS hair analysis might represent a non-invasive way to confirm LDX use within the approximate period covered by the hair segment tested, but it does not allow for quantitative therapeutic drug monitoring because of interindividual variability of concentrations in hair. Drug concentrations in hair at different stages of long-term treatment should thus be interpreted with caution by clinicians and forensic experts alike when making assessments of treatment adherence."
https://openalex.org/W3150772686,"Reciprocity motivates to reward those who are kind (= positive reciprocity) and to punish those who are unkind (= negative reciprocity). The neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT) modulates human behavior in numerous social situations, such as retaliation in response to perceived unfairness. In a placebo-controlled study, we used acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) to investigate the influence of available serotonin on choice behavior and reciprocity in the Hawk-Dove game. This game illustrates a conflict situation and incorporates two potential strategies: the cooperative Dove strategy and the uncooperative, more aggressive Hawk strategy. After strategic choices, we elicited the subjects’ expectations (= beliefs) regarding the opponent’s choices and controlled for risk preferences and current mood. We defined strategy choices as negative reciprocity when the participants opted for Hawk in response to an expected Hawk. We hypothesized that the ATD-induced reduction of 5-HT availability would increase participants’ preferences for negative reciprocity. Generalized estimating equations reveal no significant main effect of ATD on assessed belief, mood, or risk attitude. But assessment of ATD’s marginal effects over beliefs suggests that ATD significantly increases the tendency for negative reciprocity, whereas positive reciprocity (Dove in response to an expected Dove) is unaffected. We could therefore demonstrate that 5-HT availability mediates (negative) reciprocal behavior in social decision-making."
