https://openalex.org/W2106200048,"Huntington's disease is caused by an abnormal polyglutamine expansion within the protein huntingtin and is characterized by microscopic inclusion bodies of aggregated huntingtin and by the death of selected types of neuron. Whether inclusion bodies are pathogenic, incidental or a beneficial coping response is controversial. To resolve this issue we have developed an automated microscope that returns to precisely the same neuron after arbitrary intervals, even after cells have been removed from the microscope stage. Here we show, by survival analysis, that neurons die in a time-independent fashion but one that is dependent on mutant huntingtin dose and polyglutamine expansion; many neurons die without forming an inclusion body. Rather, the amount of diffuse intracellular huntingtin predicts whether and when inclusion body formation or death will occur. Surprisingly, inclusion body formation predicts improved survival and leads to decreased levels of mutant huntingtin elsewhere in a neuron. Thus, inclusion body formation can function as a coping response to toxic mutant huntingtin."
https://openalex.org/W1985534077,"Muscle wasting accompanies aging and pathological conditions ranging from cancer, cachexia, and diabetes to denervation and immobilization. We show that activation of NF-kappaB, through muscle-specific transgenic expression of activated IkappaB kinase beta (MIKK), causes profound muscle wasting that resembles clinical cachexia. In contrast, no overt phenotype was seen upon muscle-specific inhibition of NF-kappaB through expression of IkappaBalpha superrepressor (MISR). Muscle loss was due to accelerated protein breakdown through ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Expression of the E3 ligase MuRF1, a mediator of muscle atrophy, was increased in MIKK mice. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the IKKbeta/NF-kappaB/MuRF1 pathway reversed muscle atrophy. Denervation- and tumor-induced muscle loss were substantially reduced and survival rates improved by NF-kappaB inhibition in MISR mice, consistent with a critical role for NF-kappaB in the pathology of muscle wasting and establishing it as an important clinical target for the treatment of muscle atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W2084761863,Proficiency in a second language and age at acquisition affect grey-matter density. Humans have a unique ability to learn more than one language — a skill that is thought to be mediated by functional (rather than structural) plastic changes in the brain1. Here we show that learning a second language increases the density of grey matter in the left inferior parietal cortex and that the degree of structural reorganization in this region is modulated by the proficiency attained and the age at acquisition. This relation between grey-matter density and performance may represent a general principle of brain organization.

https://openalex.org/W2095267065,"Glutamate transporters are integral membrane proteins that catalyse the concentrative uptake of glutamate from the synapse to intracellular spaces by harnessing pre-existing ion gradients. In the central nervous system glutamate transporters are essential for normal development and function, and are implicated in stroke, epilepsy and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we present the crystal structure of a eukaryotic glutamate transporter homologue from Pyrococcus horikoshii. The transporter is a bowl-shaped trimer with a solvent-filled extracellular basin extending halfway across the membrane bilayer. At the bottom of the basin are three independent binding sites, each cradled by two helical hairpins, reaching from opposite sides of the membrane. We propose that transport of glutamate is achieved by movements of the hairpins that allow alternating access to either side of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2022527641,"Mosaic variegated aneuploidy is a rare recessive condition characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, childhood cancer and constitutional mosaicism for chromosomal gains and losses. In five families with mosaic variegated aneuploidy, including two with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, we identified truncating and missense mutations of BUB1B, which encodes BUBR1, a key protein in the mitotic spindle checkpoint. These data are the first to relate germline mutations in a spindle checkpoint gene with a human disorder and strongly support a causal link between aneuploidy and cancer development."
https://openalex.org/W1966584984,"The liver X receptors (LXRs) are nuclear receptors with established roles in the regulation of lipid metabolism. We now show that LXR signaling not only regulates macrophage cholesterol metabolism but also impacts antimicrobial responses. Mice lacking LXRs are highly susceptible to infection with the intracellular bacteria Listeria monocytogenes (LM). Bone marrow transplant studies point to altered macrophage function as the major determinant of susceptibility. LXR-null macrophages undergo accelerated apoptosis when challenged with LM and exhibit defective bacterial clearance in vivo. These defects result, at least in part, from loss of regulation of the antiapoptotic factor SPalpha, a direct target for regulation by LXRalpha. Expression of LXRalpha or SPalpha in macrophages inhibits apoptosis in the setting of LM infection. Our results demonstrate that LXR-dependent gene expression plays an unexpected role in innate immunity and suggest that common nuclear receptor pathways mediate macrophage responses to modified lipoproteins and intracellular pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2110107454,"RNA interference is a conserved mechanism by which double-stranded RNA is processed into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that can trigger both post-transcriptional and transcriptional gene silencing. In fission yeast, the RNA-induced initiation of transcriptional gene silencing (RITS) complex contains Dicer-generated siRNAs and is required for heterochromatic silencing. Here we show that RITS components, including Argonaute protein, bind to all known heterochromatic loci. At the mating-type region, RITS is recruited to the centromere-homologous repeat cenH in a Dicer-dependent manner, whereas the spreading of RITS across the entire 20-kb silenced domain, as well as its subsequent maintenance, requires heterochromatin machinery including Swi6 and occurs even in the absence of Dicer. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that RNA interference machinery operates in cis as a stable component of heterochromatic domains with RITS tethered to silenced loci by methylation of histone H3 at Lys9. This tethering promotes the processing of transcripts and generation of additional siRNAs for heterochromatin maintenance."

https://openalex.org/W2066795345,"Distinct classes of GABAergic synapses are segregated into subcellular domains (i.e., dendrite, soma, and axon initial segment-AIS), thereby differentially regulating the input, integration, and output of principal neurons. In cerebellum, for example, basket interneurons make exquisitely precise ""pinceau synapses"" on AIS of Purkinje neurons, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Using BAC transgenic reporter mice, we found that basket axons always contacted Purkinje soma before innervating AIS. This synapse targeting process followed the establishment of a subcellular gradient of neurofascin186 (NF186), an L1 family immunoglobulin cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), along the Purkinje AIS-soma axis. This gradient was dependent on ankyrinG, an AIS-restricted membrane adaptor protein that recruits NF186. In the absence of neurofascin gradient, basket axons lost directional growth along Purkinje neurons and precisely followed NF186 to ectopic locations. Disruption of NF186-ankyrinG interactions at AIS reduced pinceau synapse formation. These results implicate ankyrin-based localization of L1CAMs in subcellular organization of GABAergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2134735295,"The Drosophila transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) homolog Decapentaplegic (Dpp) acts as a morphogen that forms a long-range concentration gradient to direct the anteroposterior patterning of the wing. Both planar transcytosis initiated by Dynamin-mediated endocytosis and extracellular diffusion have been proposed for Dpp movement across cells. In this work, we found that Dpp is mainly extracellular, and its extracellular gradient coincides with its activity gradient. We demonstrate that a blockage of endocytosis by the dynamin mutant shibire does not block Dpp movement but rather inhibits Dpp signal transduction, suggesting that endocytosis is not essential for Dpp movement but is involved in Dpp signaling. Furthermore, we show that Dpp fails to move across cells mutant for dally and dally-like (dly), two Drosophila glypican members of heparin sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG). Our results support a model in which Dpp moves along the cell surface by restricted extracellular diffusion involving the glypicans Dally and Dly."
https://openalex.org/W1979256988,"The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb) regulates gene transcription by binding E2F transcription factors. pRb can recruit several repressor complexes to E2F bound promoters; however, native pRb repressor complexes have not been isolated. We have purified E2F/RBF repressor complexes from Drosophila embryo extracts and characterized their roles in E2F regulation. These complexes contain RBF, E2F, and Myb-interacting proteins that have previously been shown to control developmentally regulated patterns of DNA replication in follicle cells. The complexes localize to transcriptionally silent sites on polytene chromosomes and mediate stable repression of a specific set of E2F targets that have sex- and differentiation-specific expression patterns. Strikingly, seven of eight complex subunits are structurally and functionally related to C. elegans synMuv class B genes, which cooperate to control vulval differentiation in the worm. These results reveal an extensive evolutionary conservation of specific pRb repressor complexes that physically combine subunits with established roles in the regulation of transcription, DNA replication, and chromatin structure."

https://openalex.org/W2027533313,"Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARS) catalyze the ligation of amino acids to cognate tRNAs. Chordate ARSs have evolved distinctive features absent from ancestral forms, including compartmentalization in a multisynthetase complex (MSC), noncatalytic peptide appendages, and ancillary functions unrelated to aminoacylation. Here, we show that glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (GluProRS), a bifunctional ARS of the MSC, has a regulated, noncanonical activity that blocks synthesis of a specific protein. GluProRS was identified as a component of the interferon (IFN)-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation (GAIT) complex by RNA affinity chromatography using the ceruloplasmin (Cp) GAIT element as ligand. In response to IFN-γ, GluProRS is phosphorylated and released from the MSC, binds the Cp 3′-untranslated region in an mRNP containing three additional proteins, and silences Cp mRNA translation. Thus, GluProRS has divergent functions in protein synthesis: in the MSC, its aminoacylation activity supports global translation, but translocation of GluProRS to an inflammation-responsive mRNP causes gene-specific translational silencing."
https://openalex.org/W2106013763,"To cover the receptive field completely but without redundancy, neurons of certain functional groups exhibit tiling of their dendrites via dendritic repulsion. Here we show that two evolutionarily conserved proteins, the Tricornered (Trc) kinase and Furry (Fry), are essential for tiling and branching control of Drosophila sensory neuron dendrites. Dendrites of fry and trc mutants display excessive terminal branching and fail to avoid homologous dendritic branches, resulting in significant overlap of the dendritic fields. Trc control of dendritic branching involves regulation of RacGTPase, a pathway distinct from the action of Trc in tiling. Timelapse analysis further reveals a specific loss of the ability of growing dendrites to turn away from nearby dendritic branches in fry mutants, suggestive of a defect in like-repels-like avoidance. Thus, the Trc/Fry signaling pathway plays a key role in patterning dendritic fields by promoting avoidance between homologous dendrites as well as by limiting dendritic branching."

https://openalex.org/W2154448714,"Malformations of the septum, outflow tract and aortic arch are the most common congenital cardiovascular defects and occur in mice lacking Cited2, a transcriptional coactivator of TFAP2. Here we show that Cited2(-/-) mice also develop laterality defects, including right isomerism, abnormal cardiac looping and hyposplenia, which are suppressed on a mixed genetic background. Cited2(-/-) mice lack expression of the Nodal target genes Pitx2c, Nodal and Ebaf in the left lateral plate mesoderm, where they are required for establishing laterality and cardiovascular development. CITED2 and TFAP2 were detected at the Pitx2c promoter in embryonic hearts, and they activate Pitx2c transcription in transient transfection assays. We propose that an abnormal Nodal-Pitx2c pathway represents a unifying mechanism for the cardiovascular malformations observed in Cited2(-/-) mice, and that such malformations may be the sole manifestation of a laterality defect."

https://openalex.org/W2027084558,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are crucial for asymmetric cell division, but the mechanisms of signal activation remain poorly understood. Here, we establish that the evolutionarily conserved protein RIC-8 is required for proper asymmetric division of one-cell stage C. elegans embryos. Spindle severing experiments demonstrate that RIC-8 is required for generation of substantial pulling forces on astral microtubules. RIC-8 physically interacts with GOA-1 and GPA-16, two Gα subunits that act in a partially redundant manner in one-cell stage embryos. RIC-8 preferentially binds to GDP bound GOA-1 and is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for GOA-1. Our analysis suggests that RIC-8 acts before the GoLoco protein GPR-1/2 in the sequence of events leading to Gα activation. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation and in vivo epistasis demonstrate that inactivation of the Gβ subunit GPB-1 alleviates the need for RIC-8 in one-cell stage embryos. Our findings suggest a mechanism in which RIC-8 favors generation of Gα free from Gβγ and enables GPR-1/2 to mediate asymmetric cell division."

https://openalex.org/W2122212389,"Biochemical probes positioned on the surface of the general transcription factor TFIIB were used to probe the architecture of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription preinitiation complex (PIC). In PICs, the TFIIB linker and core domains are positioned over the central cleft and wall of Pol II. This positioning is not observed in the smaller Pol II-TFIIB complex. These results lead to a new model for the structure of the PIC, which agrees with most previously documented protein-DNA interactions within Pol II and archaea PICs. Specific interaction of the TFIIB core domain with Pol II positions and orients the promoter DNA over the Pol II central cleft, and TBP-DNA bending leads to bending of the promoter around the surface of Pol II. The TFIIF subunit Tfg1 was found in close proximity to the TFIIB B finger, linker, and core domains, suggesting that these two factors closely cooperate during initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2170192548,"Although PS-341 (bortezomib) is a promising agent to improve multiple myeloma (MM) patient outcome, 65% of patients with relapsed and refractory disease do not respond. We have previously shown that heat shock protein (Hsp)27 is upregulated after PS-341 treatment, that overexpression of Hsp27 confers PS-341 resistance, and that inhibition of Hsp27 overcomes PS-341 resistance. Since Hsp27 is a downstream target of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/MAPK-mitogen-activated protein kinase-2 (MAPKAPK2), we hypothesized that inhibition of p38 MAPK activity could augment PS-341 cytotoxicity by downregulating Hsp27. Although p38 MAPK inhibitor SCIO-469 (Scios Inc, CA, USA) alone did not induce significant growth inhibition, it blocked baseline and PS-341-triggered phosphorylation of p38 MAPK as well as upregulation of Hsp27, associated with enhanced cytotoxicity in MM.1S cells. Importantly, SCIO-469 enhanced phosphorylation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and augmented cleavage of caspase-8 and poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase. Moreover, SCIO-469 downregulated PS-341-induced increases in G2/M-phase cells, associated with downregulation of p21Cip1 expression. Importantly, SCIO-469 treatment augmented cytotoxicity of PS-341 even against PS-341-resistant cell lines and patient MM cells. These studies therefore provide the framework for clinical trials of SCIO-469 to enhance sensitivity and overcome resistance to PS-341, thereby improving patient outcome in MM."

https://openalex.org/W1998269481,"An oscillatory increase in pancreatic beta cell cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, is a key feature in glucose-induced insulin release. The role of the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel beta3 subunit in the molecular regulation of these [Ca2+]i oscillations has now been clarified by using beta3 subunit-deficient beta cells. beta3 knockout mice showed a more efficient glucose homeostasis compared to wild-type mice due to increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. This resulted from an increased glucose-induced [Ca2+]i oscillation frequency in beta cells lacking the beta3 subunit, an effect accounted for by enhanced formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and increased Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores. Hence, the beta3 subunit negatively modulated InsP3-induced Ca2+ release, which is not paralleled by any effect on the voltage-gated L type Ca2+ channel. Since the increase in insulin release was manifested only at high glucose concentrations, blocking the beta3 subunit in the beta cell may constitute the basis for a novel diabetes therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2115734013,"Heterotrimeric G proteins promote microtubule forces that position mitotic spindles during asymmetric cell division in C. elegans embryos. While all previously studied G protein functions require activation by seven-transmembrane receptors, this function appears to be receptor independent. We found that mutating a regulator of G protein signaling, RGS-7, resulted in hyperasymmetric spindle movements due to decreased force on one spindle pole. RGS-7 is localized at the cell cortex, and its effects require two redundant Gαo-related G proteins and their nonreceptor activators RIC-8 and GPR-1/2. Using recombinant proteins, we found that RIC-8 stimulates GTP binding by Gαo and that the RGS domain of RGS-7 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by Gαo, demonstrating that Gαo passes through the GTP bound state during its activity cycle. While GTPase activators typically inactivate G proteins, RGS-7 instead appears to promote G protein function asymmetrically in the cell, perhaps acting as a G protein effector."
https://openalex.org/W1989690022,"mRNA transport and local translation in the neuronal dendrite is implicated in the induction of synaptic plasticity. Recently, we cloned an RNA-interacting protein, SYNCRIP (heterogeneous nuclear ribonuclear protein Q1/NSAP1), that is suggested to be important for the stabilization of mRNA. We report here that SYNCRIP is a component of mRNA granules in rat hippocampal neurons. SYNCRIP was mainly found at cell bodies, but punctate expression patterns in the proximal dendrite were also seen. Time-lapse analysis in living neurons revealed that the granules labeled with fluorescent protein-tagged SYNCRIP were transported bi-directionally within the dendrite at ∼0.05 μm/s. Treatment of neurons with nocodazole significantly inhibited the movement of green fluorescent protein-SYNCRIP-positive granules, indicating that the transport of SYNCRIP-containing granules is dependent on microtubules. The distribution of SYNCRIP-containing granules overlapped with that of dendritic RNAs and elongation factor 1α. SYNCRIP was also found to be co-transported with green fluorescent protein-tagged human staufen1 and the 3′-untranslated region of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 mRNA.

In this study we performed a proteomic analysis of the protein complexes that associate with SYNCRIP in human kidney cell line 293EBNA and found that SYNCRIP preferentially associated with ribosomal proteins and RNA-binding proteins. We also found that SYNCRIP is a component of mRNA granules containing IP3R1 mRNA transported within the dendrites in a microtubule-dependent manner.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProteomic Analysis—Proteomics analysis of the proteins that associate with SYNCRIP was performed as previously described (25Yanagida M.

After vacuum-drying, the precipitate was digested with Achromobacter protease I. The digested peptide mixture were analyzed using a Direct nano flow LCMSM system as described (26Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and protein identification was performed according to the criteria described previously (26Natsume T. Yamauchi Y. Nakayama H. Shinkawa T. Yanagida M. Takahashi N. Isobe T. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 4725-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).Construction of Fusion Proteins—FLAG-tagged SYNCRIP was generated by subcloning PCR-amplified DNA fragment coding mouse SYNCRIP (19Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) fused with FLAG tag to its N terminus into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). To construct a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged SYNCRIP, the coding sequence of mouse SYNCRIP was subcloned into the PstI/KpnI site of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP)-tagged SYNCRIP (mRFP-SYNCRIP) was generated by fusing a mRFP, a gift from Dr. R. Tsien (28Campbell R.E. Tour O. Palmer A.E. Steinbach P.A. Baird G.S. Zacharias D.A. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7877-7882Crossref PubMed Scopus (1987) Google Scholar), to the N terminus of SYNCRIP with the amino acids Glu-Phe as a linker, which was then subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo+ (Invitrogen). To construct GFP-fused human staufen1 (GFP-hStau1), the coding region of hStau1 was amplified from HEP22160 (a gift from Dr. S. Sugano) and subcloned into the XhoI/HindIII site of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech).NLS-MS2-Venus was generated from pGA14-MS2-GFP (a gift from Dr. R. Singer (29Bertrand E. Chartrand P. Schaefer M. Shenoy S.M. Singer R.H. Long R.M. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar)) and pCS2-Venus (a gift from Dr. A. Miyawaki). A coding sequence of “Venus” (a variant of yellow fluorescent protein (30Nagai T. Ibata K. Park E.S. Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar)) was PCR-amplified with 5′-GTGCGGCCGCTGGTATGAGCAAGGGCGAGG-3′and 5′-CTTGAATTCTTACTTGTACAG-3′ using pCS2-Venus as a template. The NotI-EcoRI digest of the resultant cDNA fragment and the BamHI-NotI digest of pG14-MS2-GFP that corresponded to the coding sequence of MS2 coat protein and nuclear localization signal (NLS) were then introduced into the BamHI/EcoRI site of a mammalian expression vector pCS2+.To construct the RNA expression vector of the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTR) of IP3R1 (IP3R1 3′-UTR-MS2bs), we amplified a cDNA fragment of 3′-UTR of mouse IP3R1 (bases 8579–9041) by PCR using primers 5′-GGCTCGAGGCAAATGAGGCAGAGGGAC-3′, and 5′-GCGGGCCCAACCATTTATTACACGAGTATCAAC-3′. The resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the XhoI/ApaI site of pcDNA3.1/Zeo+, upstream of which 12 copies of MS2 phage coat protein binding sequences (MS2bs) and the coding sequence of alkaline phosphatase were inserted, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal downstream to the multicloning site was removed.Cell Culture and Transfection—Primary cultures of neurons were prepared from hippocampi of 1-day-old Wistar rats by a standard method as described previously (31Higgins D. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 37-78Google Scholar, 32Bannai H. Inoue T. Nakayama T. Hattori M. Mikoshiba K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and plated on poly-l-lysine (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan)-coated coverslips at a density of 4.6 × 104-1.3 × 105 cells/cm2. Cells were cultured in Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2.5 mm l-glutamine (Nacalai Tesque), 2.5% (v/v) B-27 (Invitrogen), and antibiotics (250 units/ml penicillin and 250 μg/ml streptomycin). The cultures were transfected with 10 μg of DNAs by a standard calcium phosphate method (33Köhrmann M. Haubensak W. Hemraj I. Kaether C. Leβmann V.J. Kiebler M.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 831-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or 2.5 μg of DNAs by lipofection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) (34Blanpied T.A. Scott D.B. Ehlers M.D. Neuron. 2002; 36: 435-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) on days 5–6 in vitro. For the labeling of 3′-UTR of IP3R1 mRNA, 0.6 μg of NLS-MS2-Venus and 1.8 μg of IP3R1 3′-UTR-MS2bs were co-transfected by lipofection. The transfected cells were used for immunohistochemistry or imaging experiments 2–3 days after the transfection, which corresponded to days 7–9 in vitro.Antibodies—The rabbit antibody recognizing the N-terminal region of SYNCRIP, anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody, was obtained as described previously (19Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-SYNCRIP-N was used after affinity purification, and the specificity of this antibody has been confirmed by parallel experiments using preimmune serum or anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody preincubated with an excess amount of antigenic polypeptide (19Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Anti-elongation factor1α (EF1α) antibody was from Upstate Biotechnology (Charlottesville, VA, clone CBP-KK1). Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR).Immunohistochemistry, Cell Labeling Experiments, and Confocal Imaging—For immunohistochemistry of native hippocampus, Wistar rats were deeply anesthetized on postnatal day 7 and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Whole brains were removed and post-fixed in the same fixative overnight at 4 °C. Sagittal sections (thickness, 100 μm) were cut with a Vibratome-type micro slicer (DTK-1500; Dosaka EM, Kyoto, Japan), collected in PBS, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100. After incubating with blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) sections were incubated with anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody (1:1000 dilution) in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C and subsequently with Alexa 488-conjugated anti rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) for 3 h at room temperature. Finally, sections were mounted on slides with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and observed under a confocal-scanning microscope (FV-300; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) attached to an inverted microscope (IX70; Olympus) with a ×10 objective (NA 0.30; Olympus) and a ×40 objective (NA 0.85; Olympus).For immunostaining of cultured neurons, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min. After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocking with 5% skim milk in PBS, the cells were incubated with the primary antibodies at 1:1000 dilution for anti-SYNCRIP-N antibody and at 1:400 dilution for anti-EF1α antibody. Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated IgGs (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. RNA labeling with ethidium bromide (EtBr) was performed as described previously (35Tang S.J. Meulemans D. Vazquez L. Colaco N. Schuman E. Neuron. 2001; 32: 463-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). RNase treatment was conducted by incubating neurons with 20 μg/ml RNase A (Nippongene, Tokyo, Japan) for 15 min after the EtBr staining. For labeling hippocampal neurons with endosomal and lysosomal markers, cells were incubated with 1 mg/ml Texas Red-dextran (Mr 3000; Molecular Probes) overnight. Fluorescence images of cultured neurons were taken under a confocal-scanning microscope (FV-300) using a 60× objective (NA 1.4; Olympus).All of the images taken by the confocal microscope were digitally smoothed to reduce the noise level. The smoothing filter was implemented using 3 × 3 spatial convolutions, where the value of each pixel in the selection was replaced with the weighted average of its 3 × 3 neighborhood. Center pixels are 4-fold weighted over surrounding pixels.Time-lapse Imaging and Data Analysis—The culture medium was supplemented with 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.3) for the time-lapse imaging experiments. The temperature was maintained at ∼37 °C by a heating chamber that surrounded the microscope stage. For single color time-lapse imaging, the cells were visualized under an inverted microscope (IX70, Olympus) and a 60× objective (NA 1.45, Olympus) using standard filter sets and a mercury lamp. Sequential images were acquired with a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (ORCA-ER; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) with a 58- or 117-ms exposure time every 10 s. For multicolor time-lapse imaging, neurons were visualized under an inverted microscope (IX81; Olympus) equipped with a motorized fluorescence mirror unit exchanger, standard filter sets, and a 60× objective (NA 1.4; Olympus). Images were taken with a cooled CCD camera (ORCA-ER) with a 200-ms exposure time every 10 s.Data were analyzed using TI Workbench, which is a custom-made software written by T. Inoue. Positions of fluorescent vesicles were plotted against time, and velocity of the granular movements was obtained by linear fitting of the slope. Only structures moving in more than three image frames were taken into account. The velocities were calculated for each period of consecutive movement. Images of time-lapse (Figs. 3A, 6B, and 7C) presented in this study were subjected to digital smoothing with the same algorithm as the confocal images (see above) to reduce the noise level.Fig. 6The GFP-SYNCRIP protein co-localized with the components of mRNA granules.

Neurons were incubated with nocodazole (30 μg/ml) and latrunculin A (1 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. To confirm that the cytoskeleton was disrupted, fixed cells were stained with anti-tubulin antibody (Lab Vision, CA) or Alexa 594-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). We found no changes in the microtubules or actin structure from control cells exposed to 0.1–0.3% Me2SO (data not shown).RESULTSProteomic Analysis of SYNCRIP-associated Proteins—Proteins associated with SYNCRIP were isolated by immunoprecipitation from human 293EBNA cells expressing FLAG-tagged SYNCRIP by using anti-FLAG antibody. The 111 proteins listed in supplemental Table SI were identified as components of protein complexes containing FLAG-tagged SYNCRIP. Among these 111 proteins, 44 were identified as ribosomal proteins (39.6%) and 26 were mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (23.4%), which are encoded by nuclear genes and synthesized in the cytosol (36O'Brien T.W. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 286: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 and supplemental Table SI). In addition, 26 RNA-binding proteins (23.4%) including 8 hnRNPs (7.2%), 4 DEAD box helicases (3.6%), and 4 splicing factors (3.6%) were also identified as SYNCRIP-associated proteins. These results suggest that SYNCRIP preferentially associates with protein complexes involved in mRNA processing and translation.Fig. 1Classification of the 111 proteins identified as components of the SYNCRIP-associated protein complexes in 293EBNA cells. Detailed compositions of each class are shown in supplemental Table SI.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Distribution and Dynamics of SYNCRIP in Hippocampal Neurons—mRNA granules, the ribonucleoprotein complexes present in neuronal dendrites, have been reported to contain ribosomes and other components of translation machinery (9Knowles R.B.

The above results of proteomic analysis in 293EBNA cells indicate that SYNCRIP preferentially associates with the major component of mRNA granules, that is, ribosomal proteins and RNA-binding proteins (Fig. 1, supplemental Table SI). In addition, SYNCRIP itself has the ability to bind to RNA, preferentially to poly(A) and poly(U) sequences in vitro (19Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol.

These findings led us to hypothesize that SYNCRIP is a component of the mRNA granules in neuronal dendrites.To test this hypothesis, we investigated the expression pattern and dynamics of SYNCRIP in the dendrites of rat hippocampal neurons. Expression of SYNCRIP within the hippocampus of rats was investigated by immunohistochemistry using anti-SYCNRIP-N antibodies. SYNCRIP was expressed in the pyramidal cell layer and granular cell layer (Fig. 2A), and SYNCRIP signals were mainly observed in the cell bodies of hippocampal neurons (Fig. 2B). In addition, the proximal dendrites of pyramidal cells were also labeled with the SYNCRIP antibody (Fig. 2B, arrowheads). To investigate the localization and dynamics of SYNCRIP in detail, we transfected cultured rat hippocampal neurons with plasmid DNAs encoding mouse SYNCRIP (19Mizutani A. Fukuda M. Ibata K. Shiraishi Y. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9823-9831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) tagged with GFP (GFP-SYNCRIP). To confirm that GFP-SYNCRIP reflects the localization of endogenous SYNCRIP in cultured hippocampal neurons, we compared the immunocytochemical patterns of endogenous SYNCRIP and the distribution of GFP-SYNCRIP signals. Endogenous SYNCRIP was distributed in the dendrites as well as in the cell body of cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 3A, left) as was observed in native tissue. SYNCRIP was found in granules of various sizes in the dendrites (Fig. 3A, right, arrowheads). GFP-SYNCRIP also exhibited a distribution pattern very similar to that of endogenous SYNCRIP (Fig. 3B), indicating that the expression pattern of GFP-SYNCRIP reliably reflects that of endogenous SYNCRIP in cultured neurons.Fig. 2Distribution pattern of endogenous SYNCRIP in rat hippocampus.

https://openalex.org/W2135187058,"Thyroid cancer includes three types of carcinomas classified as differentiated thyroid carcinomas (DTC), medullary thyroid carcinomas, and undifferentiated carcinomas (UTC). DTC and medullary thyroid carcinomas generally have a good prognosis, but UTC are usually fatal. Consequently, there is a need for new effective therapeutic modalities to improve the survival of UTC patients. Here we show that NF-κB is activated in human thyroid neoplasms, particularly in undifferentiated carcinomas. Thyroid cell lines, reproducing in vitro the different thyroid neoplasias, also show basal NF-κB activity and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, which correlates with the level of NF-κB activation. Activation of NF-κB in the DTC cell line NPA renders these cells resistant to drug-induced apoptosis. Stable expression of a super-repressor form of IκBα (IκBαM) in the UTC cell line FRO results in enhanced sensitivity to drug-induced apoptosis, to the loss of the ability of these cells to form colonies in soft agar, and to induce tumor growth in nude mice. In addition, we show that FRO cells display a very low JNK activity that is restored in FRO-IκBαM clones. Moreover, inhibition of JNK activity renders FRO-IκBαM clones resistant to apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents. Our results indicate that NF-κB plays a pivotal role in thyroid carcinogenesis, being required for tumor growth and for resistance to drug-induced apoptosis, the latter function very likely through the inhibition of JNK activity. Furthermore, the strong constitutive NF-κB activity in human anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, besides representing a novel diagnostic tool, makes NF-κB a target for the development of novel therapeutic strategies.

Thyroid carcinomas are one of the most common neoplasias of the endocrine system (1Figge J. Wartofsky L. Thyroid Cancer: A Comprehensive Guide to Clinical Management. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 515-535Google Scholar). Four types of thyroid cancer comprise more than 98% of all thyroid tumors: papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma, both of which may be summarized as differentiated thyroid carcinoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), 1The abbreviations used are: MTC, medullary thyroid carcinoma; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; IKK, IκB kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; DTC, differentiated thyroid carcinomas; UTC, undifferentiated carcinomas; ATC, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma; EMSA, electromobility shift assay; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; XIAP, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis; CFSE, 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester; GADD, growth arrest and DNA damage; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt. and undifferentiated anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) (2Sherman S.I. The Lancet. 2003; 361: 501-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar). Papillary thyroid carcinoma, follicular thyroid carcinoma, and ATC are derived from the thyroid follicular epithelial cells, whereas MTC is derived from the parafollicular C cells (3Gimm O. Cancer Lett. 2001; 163: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignant thyroid neoplasm in countries with sufficient iodine diets and comprises up to 80% of all thyroid malignancies. Follicular thyroid carcinoma is more common in regions with insufficient iodine diets and represents ∼10–20% of all thyroid malignancies. The overall 5–10 year survival rate of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma is about 80–95%, whereas that of patients with follicular thyroid carcinoma is about 70–95% (3Gimm O. Cancer Lett. 2001; 163: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The incidence of MTC is not well known because epidemiologic studies are rare. Generally, it is believed that MTC comprises about 5–10% of all thyroid malignancies (2Sherman S.I. The Lancet. 2003; 361: 501-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar, 3Gimm O. Cancer Lett. 2001; 163: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 4Ball D.W.

ATC is one of the most aggressive human malignancies, with a very poor prognosis. Although rare, accounting for up to 10% of clinically recognized thyroid cancers, the overall median survival is limited to months (2Sherman S.I.

Consequently, there is a need for new therapeutic tools for the treatment of these tumors. The NF-κB family of transcription factors regulates the expression of a wide spectrum of genes involved in inflammation, immune response, cellular stress, cancer, and apoptosis (7Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4611) Google Scholar, 8Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin.

In most cell types, NF-κB is present in a latent form in the cytoplasm and bound to NF-κB inhibitory proteins collectively termed IκBs (10Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). A wide variety of extracellular signals, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, bacterial and viral infections, oxidative stress, etc., initiate signaling cascade that culminates in the phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBs, through a proteasome-dependent pathway (11Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar, 12Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB frees NF-κB to enter the nucleus and to activate transcription of target genes (11Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3448) Google Scholar). IκB phosphorylation is mediated by a large complex referred to as the IκB kinase complex (IKK complex), composed of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ (13Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar) as well as a regulatory protein, named NEMO/IKKγ (14Yamaoka S. Courtois G. Bessia C. Whiteside S.T. Weil R. Agou F.

Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2580) Google Scholar), those that preserve function of mitochondria, such as Bcl-XL (21Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L.

Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Because it has been proposed that suppression of apoptosis is associated with oncogenic potential, and given the ability of NF-κB inhibitors to increase susceptibility to apoptosis in transformed cells (23Orlowski R.Z. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Trends Mol. Med. 2002; 8: 385-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), one role for NF-κB activation could be to suppress transformation-associated apoptosis. The NF-κB signal transduction pathway is misregulated in a variety of human cancers, especially ones of lymphoid origin, due either to genetic changes (such as chromosomal rearrangements, amplifications, and mutations) or to chronic activation of the pathway by epigenetic mechanisms (24Gilmore T. Gapuzan M.E. Kalaitzidis D. Starczynowski D. Cancer Lett. 2002; 181: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Basal activation of the NF-κB pathway can contribute to the oncogenic state in several ways: by driving proliferation (25Bargou R.C. Emmerich F. Krappmann D. Bommert K. Mapara M.Y. Arnold W. Royer H.D. Grinstein E. Greiner A. Scheidereit C. Dörkin B. J. Clin. Investig. 1997; 100: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar), by enhancing cell survival (26Duffey D.C. Chen Z. Dong G. Ondrey F.G. Wolf J.S. Brown K. Siebenlist U. Van Waes C. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 3468-3474PubMed Google Scholar), by promoting angiogenesis, or by metastasis (27Huang S. Pettaway C.A. Uehara H. Bucana C.D. Fidler I.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4188-4197Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Because the development of a highly malignant tumor requires several changes in cellular metabolism, including ones affecting apoptosis, it is not surprising that the NF-κB signal transduction pathway, which influences various aspects of cellular physiology, has emerged as playing a major role in many human cancers. c-Jun NH2-terminal protein kinase (JNK), also known as stress-activated protein kinase (28Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase superfamily (29Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar), having three isoforms, JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3, with splicing variants (30Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that JNK signaling is involved in stress-induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway (30Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar, 31Tournier C. Hess P. Yang D.D. Xu J. Turner T.K. Nimnual A. Bar-Sagi D. Jones S.N. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Science. 2000; 288: 870-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar), even though some studies have indicated that JNK may also contribute to cell survival (30Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3646) Google Scholar). From different experimental evidence, it seems clear that the duration of JNK activation affects its role in apoptosis: i.e. prolonged but not transient JNK activation promotes TNF-α-induced apoptosis (32De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 33Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). However, it has also been demonstrated that prolonged JNK activation alone may not be sufficient to induce apoptosis (33Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Thus, the dual role of JNK in both apoptotic and antiapoptotic signaling pathways suggests that the function of JNK is complex and that the physiological response most likely reflects a balance between the ability of JNK to signal both apoptosis and cell survival. It has long been speculated that the role of the JNK pathway in apoptosis is affected by other signaling pathways. This has been recently demonstrated by two different groups (32De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 33Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) in two independent ways. Both of them showed that NF-κB is able to inhibit TNF-α-induced apoptosis by negatively regulating activation of the JNK pathway. They also demonstrated that the negative regulation of JNK activity exerted by NF-κB is mediated by two genes, GADD45β (32De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) and XIAP (33Tang G. Minemoto Y. Dibling B. Purcell N.H. Li Z. Karin M. Lin A. Nature. 2001; 414: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), both of them under the transcriptional control of NF-κB. Very little is known about the role that NF-κB plays in thyroid physiology. There is little evidence that NF-κB may be important in RET-mediated carcinogenesis and that may be involved in maintaining the transformed phenotype of thyroid cell lines (34Pang X.P. Hershman J.M. Chung M. Pekary A.E. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1783-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 35Visconti R. Cerutti J. Battista S. Fedele M. Trapasso F. Zeki K. Miano M.P. de Nigris F. Casalino L. Curcio F. Santoro M. Fusco A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the role that NF-κB plays “in vivo” in human thyroid neoplasia has not been fully investigated. Here we show that NF-κB is aberrantly expressed in primary human thyroid carcinomas, and we provide evidence that NF-κB is required for maintaining the transformed phenotype of UTC cells. Cell Lines—NPA is a cell line derived from human papillary thyroid carcinoma (36Ludwig L. Kessler H. Wagner M. Hoang-vu C. Dralle H. Adler G. Böhm B.O. Schmid R.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4526-4535PubMed Google Scholar); FRO is a cell line derived from human anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (37Fagin J.A. Matsuo K. Karmakar A. Chen D.L. Tang S.H. Koeffler H.P. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 179-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar); and WRO is a cell line derived from human follicular thyroid carcinoma (38Estour B. Van Herle A.J. Juillard G.J. Totanes T.L. Sparkes R.S. Giuliano A.E. Klandorf H. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. Incl. Mol. Pathol. 1989; 57: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). They were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma). FRO cells were transfected with the empty expression vector pcDNA3.1-FLAG (Invitrogen) (FRO Neo cells) or with the expression vector pcDNA3.1-FLAG vector encoding a mutant form (S32A/S36A) of IκBα (FRO IκBαM cells) (a kindly gift of Dr. G. Franzoso) (32De Smaele E. Zazzeroni F. Papa S. Nguyen D.U. Jin R. Jones J. Cong R. Franzoso G. Nature. 2001; 414: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). NPA cells were transfected with the empty expression vector pcDNA3.1-FLAG (Invitrogen) (NPA Neo cells) or with the expression vector pcDNA3.1-FLAG vector encoding human IKKβ (39Leonardi A. Chariot A. Claudio E. Cunningham K. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10494-10499Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (NPA IKKβ cells). The stable transfected clones were selected and maintained in the presence of geneticin (200 μg/ml). Immunohistochemical Analysis—Specimens from normal and pathological human thyroid were isolated, rinsed with PBS, fixed in 4% buffered neutral formalin, and embedded in paraffin. 5–6-μm-thick paraffin sections were then deparaffinized and placed in a solution of absolute methanol and 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 30 min and then washed in PBS before immunoperoxidase staining. Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber with antibody anti-p65 diluted 1:100 in PBS and subsequently incubated, first with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 20 min (Vectostain ABC kits, Vector Laboratories) and then with pre-mixed reagent ABC (Vector Laboratories) for 20 min. The antibody anti-p65 used was a rabbit polyclonal antibody from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (SC 7151). The same results were obtained by using a mouse monoclonal anti-nuclear localization signal from Roche Applied Science. The immunostaining was performed by incubating slides in diaminobenzidine (Dako) solution containing 0.06 mm diaminobenzidine and 2 mm hydrogen peroxide in 0.05% PBS (pH 7.6) for 5 min, and after chromogen development, slides were washed, dehydrated with alcohol and xylene, and mounted with coverslips using a permanent mounting medium (Permount). Electromobility Shift Assays—To analyze NF-κB DNA binding activity, total cell extracts were prepared using a detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)). Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in cold PBS, and resuspended in detergent lysis buffer (30 μl/5 × 106 cells). The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was determined, and equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 100,000 cpm of a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, containing specific binding sites for NF-κB, in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and run on a 4% acrylamide gel. To analyze AP-1 DNA binding activity, nuclear extracts were prepared as follows: cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed once in cold PBS, and resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA). The cells were then centrifuged for 5 min at 1,000 × g and resuspended in cold buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 25% glycerol). The cell resuspension was subjected to strong shaking for 30 min at 4 °C and then centrifuged for 15 min at 1,000 × g. The protein content of the supernatant was determined, and equal amounts of protein (10 μg) were added to a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), 10 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and 100,000 cpm of wild-type or mutant 32P-labeled AP-1 oligonucleotides, in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and run on a 4% acrylamide gel. Luciferase Assays—4 × 105 cells/well were seeded in a 6-well plate. After 12 h, cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of the Ig-κB-luciferase reporter gene plasmid. Cell extracts were prepared 24 h after transfection, and reporter gene activity was determined by the luciferase system (Promega). A pRSV-β-galactosidase vector (0.2 μg) was used to normalize for transfection efficiencies. Cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (400 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (2 μm) for 3 h before lysis. In Vitro and in Vivo Tumorigenicity Assays—To analyze the ability of the various FRO clones to form colonies in soft agar, 1 × 104 cells were seeded in 60-mm dishes onto 0.3% Noble Agar (Difco) on top of a 0.6% bottom layer. Colonies larger than 50 cells were scored after 2 weeks incubation at 37 °C (40Macpherson I. Montagnier I. Virology. 1964; 23: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar). To analyze the ability of the various FRO clones to induce tumor growth in nude mice, 2 × 107 cells were injected subcutaneously on a flank of each 6-week-old nude mouse (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Lecco, Italy). Thirty days later, mice were killed, and tumors were excised. Tumors weight was determined, and their diameters were measured with calipers. Tumors volumes were calculated by the formula: a2 × b × 0.4, where a is the smallest diameter, and b is the diameter perpendicular to a. No mouse showed signs of wasting or other visible indications of toxicity. The mice were maintained at the Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Molecolare animal facility and housed in barrier facilities on a 12-h light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal experiments described here were conducted in accordance with accepted standards of animal care and in accordance with the Italian regulations for the welfare of animals used in studies of experimental neoplasia, and the study was approved by our institutional committee on animal care. Cytotoxic Treatments and Measurements of Apoptosis—1 × 103 cells/well were seeded in 96-well culture plates and incubated for 48 h at 37 °C with different concentrations of cisplatin or doxorubicin and, where indicated, with/without 10 μm JNK inhibitor SP600125 (BioMol Research Laboratories Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA). Cell survival was examined by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS), and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Cell death was assessed by staining of exposed phosphatidylserine on cell membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated annexin V (Pharmingen) or by propidium iodide staining according to Nicoletti et al. (41Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4426) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), equipped with ModFit Software. Results were mean ± S.D. of at least three separate experiments. Western Blot Analysis—Subconfluent monolayers of parental and transfected FRO cells were washed three times with PBS and then lysed in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Sigma). An aliquot of the cell lysates was used to evaluate the protein content by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad). Total proteins from cell lysates (50 μg) were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting of gels onto polyvinylidene difluoride sheets (Millipore, Bedford, MA), filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 10% non-fat dry milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl). The filters were then incubated in the same buffer for 14–16 h at 4 °C with 1:2000 dilution of the Ab-FLAG (F 7425) polyclonal antibody (Sigma). After TBST washing, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in TBST buffer and then revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). A similar procedure was achieved to analyze phospho-JNK and total JNK levels on lysates from parental and transfected FRO cells after treatment with 10 μg/ml anisomycin (Sigma) at different time intervals. In this case, the monoclonal Ab-pJNK1/2 (9255) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) recognizing phosphorylated JNK or the polyclonal Ab-JNK1/2 (9252) (Cell Signaling Technology Inc.) recognizing total JNK were used at 1:1000 dilution. After TBST washing, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies horseradish peroxidase-conjugated (Amersham Biosciences), diluted 1:5000 in TBST buffer, and then revealed by ECL (Amersham Biosciences). [3H]Thymidine DNA Incorporation—5 × 104 cells/well were seeded in 12-well culture plates and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C with 0.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences). After three washings with cold PBS, cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of 20% trichloroacetic acid. The trichloroacetic acid was removed, and cells were lysed with gentle shaking for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1 n NaOH (0.5 ml/well). An aliquot of lysates (0.1 ml) was used to evaluate the protein content by colorimetric assay (Bio-Rad), whereas the remnant was analyzed at the β-counter (Beckman Instruments) after adding an equal volume (0.4 ml) of 1 n HCl to neutralize the samples. Results were the means ± S.D. of two separate experiments. CFSE Cell Proliferation Assay—The analysis of cell proliferation was performed by labeling cells with CFSE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as originally described (42Lyons A.B. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 516-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry and data analysis were performed by using a two laser equipped FACSCalibur apparatus and the Cellquest analysis software (BD Biosciences), as described (43Lanier L.L. Recktenweld D.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1991; 2: 192-195Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Basal NF-κB Activity in Human Thyroid Carcinomas—To determine the activation state of NF-κB in primary thyroid cancer tissues, human specimens from normal thyroid, papillary, follicular and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas were collected and stained with anti-p65 (RelA) antibodies. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table I. No nuclear staining for RelA was detected in normal thyroid follicular cells (Fig. 1A), whereas few nuclei from papillary carcinoma cells were positive for RelA. Follicular carcinoma cells showed ∼50% of their nuclei stained for NF-κB, whereas anaplastic carcinoma cells showed almost 100% of their nuclei strongly positive for NF-κB (Fig. 1, B–D, and Table I). Most interestingly, the increased nuclear localization of NF-κB correlates with the increased malignant phenotype of thyroid carcinomas, suggesting that sustained activation of NF-κB confers an advantage for clonal selectivity. These results indicate that the nuclear localization of p65 is a characteristic of human anaplastic thyroid carcinomas and suggest a role of NF-κB in human thyroid carcinomas.Table INF-κB nuclear localization in normal and pathological human thyroid tissuesHistological type of thyroid samplesNo. positive cases/no. total cases analyzed by immunohistochemistryNF-κB staining scoreNormal thyroid0/40Papillary carcinoma6/61+Follicular carcinoma5/52+Anaplastic carcinoma4/43+ Open table in a new tab NF-κB Transcriptional"

https://openalex.org/W2061516414,"Amino acids are nutrients responsible for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) regulation in mammalian cells. The mTOR protein is mainly known for its role in regulating cell growth, notably via protein synthesis. In addition to amino acids, mTOR is regulated by insulin via a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase)-dependent pathway. mTOR mediates crosstalk between amino acids and insulin signaling. We show that in freshly isolated rat adipocytes, insulin stimulates the phosphorylation of mTOR on serine 2448, a protein kinase B (PKB) consensus phosphorylation site. This site is also phosphorylated by amino acids, which in contrast to insulin do not activate PKB. Moreover, insulin and amino acids have an additive effect on mTOR phosphorylation, indicating that they act via two independent pathways. Importantly, amino acids, notably leucine, permit insulin to stimulate PKB when PI 3-kinase is inhibited. They also rescue glucose transport and the mTOR pathway. Further, leucine alone can improve insulin activation of PKB in db/db mice. Our results define the importance of amino acids in insulin signaling and reveal leucine as a key amino acid in disease situations associated with insulin-resistance in adipocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1991493135,"Thioredoxin (Trx) is a cellular redox enzyme that plays multiple roles in regulating cell growth and apoptosis. Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1) was originally identified as a coactivator of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription and was also shown to promote degradation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27Kip1. Recently, Jab1 expression was associated with the progression and poor prognosis of pituitary, epithelial ovarian, and breast cancers, suggesting that it plays a role in oncogenesis. Here, we report that Trx specifically interacts with and modulates the function of Jab1. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation studies revealed that Trx and Jab1 colocalize and directly interact with each other. Further, Trx negatively regulates two important Jab1-controlled signaling pathways, activation of AP-1 transcription and degradation of p27Kip1, probably through a direct interaction between Trx and C-terminal of Jab1. The negative effect of Trx on AP-1 activity is Jab1-dependent, as it disappears when Jab1 levels are suppressed by an antisense approach. In addition, Trx competes with p27Kip1 for Jab1 binding. Taken together, our results suggest that Trx may regulate cell cycle and growth through a novel modulation of Jab1-mediated proliferation signals, further indicating that Trx may have the ability to control tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2043449896,"Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are classic lesions of Alzheimer's disease. NFTs are bundles of abnormally phosphorylated tau, the paired helical filaments. The initiating mechanisms of NFTs and their role in neuronal loss are still unknown. Accumulating evidence supports a role for the activation of proteolytic enzymes, caspases, in neuronal death observed in brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Alterations in tau phosphorylation and tau cleavage by caspases have been previously reported in neuronal apoptosis. However, the links between the alterations in tau phosphorylation and its proteolytic cleavage have not yet been documented. Here, we show that, during staurosporine-induced neuronal apoptosis, tau first undergoes transient hyperphosphorylation, which is followed by dephosphorylation and cleavage. This cleavage generated a 10-kDa fragment in addition to the 17- and 50-kDa tau fragments previously reported. Prior tau dephosphorylation by a glycogen synthase kinase-3β inhibitor, lithium, enhanced tau cleavage and sensitized neurons to staurosporine-induced apoptosis. Caspase inhibition prevented tau cleavage without reversing changes in tau phosphorylation linked to apoptosis. Furthermore, the microtubule depolymerizing agent, colchicine, induced tau dephosphorylation and caspase-independent tau cleavage and degradation. Both phenomena were blocked by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) by okadaic acid. These experiments indicate that tau dephosphorylation precedes and is required for its cleavage and degradation. We propose that the absence of cleavage and degradation of hyperphosphorylated tau (due to PP2A inhibition) may lead to its accumulation in degenerating neurons. This mechanism may contribute to the aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau into paired helical filaments in Alzheimer's disease where reduced PP2A activity has been reported.

Among these kinases, glycogen synthase kinase-3 and particularly the glycogen synthase kinase-3β isoform have been most implicated in tau hyperphosphorylation (6Baum L. Seger R. Woodgett J.R.

Tau, in its hyperphosphorylated form, is the major component of PHF, the building block of neurofibrillary tangle lesions observed in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) (7Lee V.M.

Apoptosis, a form of cell death is classically divided into three sequential phases: the induction phase, the commitment phase, and the execution phase, which is considered as the final stage. During the execution phase, all morphological hallmarks of apoptosis occur, and the cell loses viability. Once this phase begins, death becomes irreversible (10McCarthy M.J. Rubin L.L. Philpott K.L. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2165-2173PubMed Google Scholar). This phase is initiated by the activation of several subsets of proteases, including caspases, calpains, cathepsin D, and proteasomes (for review see Ref. 11Martinou J.C. Sadoul R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of cellular proteins is one of the critical mechanisms of apoptosis (12Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 443-446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1930) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins are cytoskeletal proteins such as actin, fodrin, and gelsolin (13Brancolini C. Benedetti M. Schneider C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5179-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Martin S.J. O'Brien G.A. Nishioka W.K. McGahon A.J. Mahboubi A. Saido T.C. Green D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Tau and other cytoskeletal proteins play an important role in facilitating the cytoskeletal reorganization that occurs during apoptotic cell death (15Levee M.G. Dabrowska M.I. Lelli Jr., J.L. Hinshaw D.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: 1981-1992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given its role in the stabilization of microtubules, it is therefore not surprising that changes in tau phosphorylation states (which alter its binding to microtubules) play an important role in cell fate. In fact, several studies reported that tau is hyperphosphorylated during neuronal apoptosis and that this phosphorylation occurs in a site-specific manner and results in decreased tau binding to microtubules (16Davis P.K. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35686-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using primary neuronal cultures from embryonic rat cortices, Lesort et al. (19Lesort M. Blanchard C. Yardin C. Esclaire F. Hugon J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) demonstrated that, in situ, tau was dephosphorylated at the Tau-1 epitope in apoptotic neurons. This finding was then confirmed in apoptosis of human cell lines (16Davis P.K. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35686-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 20Mills J. Lee V.M. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 625-636PubMed Google Scholar) and cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (18Canu N. Dus L. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Brancolini C. Rinaldi A.M. Novak M. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, in a more detailed study, Mills et al. (20Mills J. Lee V.M. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 625-636PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in individual PC-12 cells undergoing apoptosis, tau dephosphorylation takes place early in the execution phase of apoptosis. Using cerebellar granule cell cultures deprived of potassium or serum, Canu et al. (18Canu N. Dus L. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Brancolini C. Rinaldi A.M. Novak M. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that tau dephosphorylation at the Tau-1 epitope is associated with tau cleavage giving rise to a final 17-kDa dephosphorylated tau fragment, which resulted from tau proteolysis by calpain. Whether tau dephosphorylation preceded or followed tau cleavage was not investigated. To understand the opposing data concerning the modifications in tau phosphorylation during neuronal apoptosis and to situate these modifications in relation to tau cleavage and apoptosis, we analyzed the sequential modifications of tau phosphorylation during apoptotic processes. We also assessed the effects of tau phosphorylation/dephosphorylation on its cleavage and on the vulnerability of neurons to apoptosis. Material—To assess tau phosphorylation, the following antibodies were used: AT-8, AT-180, and AT-270 were purchased from Innogenetics (Belgium); Tau-1 from Chemicon and distributed by Euromedex (France); and T46, AD-2, 12E8, and TauC3 monoclonal antibodies were kindly provided by Dr. V. M.-Y. Lee (University of Pennsylvania), Dr. C. Mourton-Gilles (Montpellier, France), Dr. P. Seubert (San Francisco, CA), and Prof. L. I. Binder (Chicago, IL), respectively. According to the residue numbering of the longest human tau isoform of 441 amino acids (21Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Jakes R. Rutherford D. Crowther R.A. Neuron. 1989; 3: 519-526Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1780) Google Scholar), Tau-1 recognizes tau only when serines 195, 198, 199, and 202 are not phosphorylated. AT-8 recognizes tau when phosphorylated at Ser202 and Thr205. AT180 recognizes tau protein when phosphorylated at threonines 231 and 235. AT-270 recognizes tau phosphorylated at Thr181. AD-2 recognizes a phosphorylated epitope, including Ser396, and, to a lesser extent, Ser404 (22Buee-Scherrer V. Buee L. Hof P.R. Leveugle B. Gilles C. Loerzel A.J. Perl D.P. Delacourte A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 924-932PubMed Google Scholar). 12E8 detects tau phosphorylated at Ser262 and to a lesser extent at Ser356 (23Seubert P. Mawal-Dewan M. Barbour R. Jakes R. Goedert M. Johnson G.V.

T46 recognizes an epitope located at the C terminus (residues 404–441). The phospho-independent antibody Tau-5 (residues 210–230) was purchased from Calbiochem. Polyclonal anti-global tau antibody (Tau-G) and anti-actin antibody were obtained from Sigma. TauC3 antibody specifically recognizes residues 412–421 of tau cleaved at Asp421 (24Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Staurosporine, LiCl, and okadaic acid (OKA) were purchased from Sigma. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Cell Cultures—Cortical cultures were prepared from embryonic Wistar rats (E17) as previously described (25Terro F. Esclaire F. Yardin C. Hugon J. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Induction and Assessment of Apoptosis—Eight-day in vitro cultures were exposed to staurosporine, a well known trigger of apoptosis (26Boix J. Llecha N. Yuste V.J. Comella J.X. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 811-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Staurosporine (1 mm stock solution) was dissolved in Me2SO and kept in aliquots at -20 °C until use. Working solutions were prepared in bathing culture medium. To analyze time-dependent changes in tau phosphorylation occurring during staurosporine-induced apoptosis, cultures were exposed to a single dose of staurosporine (0.5 μm) for different time periods (15, 30, and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 16, and 24 h). Control cultures were incubated in bathing culture medium containing <0.1% vehicle Me2SO. Cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde were stained with the specific nuclear dye, 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Nuclear staining was examined under epifluorescence microscope (Eclipse E-800, Nikon) using an appropriate filter. Cells with fragmented nuclei (three to four lobes) were considered apoptotic. At least 500 cells were assessed, and the percentage of apoptotic neurons was calculated. Role of Caspases in Tau Cleavage and Apoptosis—To assess the involvement of caspases in tau cleavage and apoptosis, caspases were inhibited by 50 and 100 μm pan caspase inhibitor, t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp (OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Boc-d-FMK) (Enzyme Systems Products, CA). Boc-d-FMK was added to cultures 2 h prior to and once during staurosporine exposure. Relationship between Tau Dephosphorylation and Cleavage—Tau dephosphorylation was previously demonstrated to occur during the execution phase of apoptosis (20Mills J. Lee V.M. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 625-636PubMed Google Scholar). To induce tau dephosphorylation, cultures were preincubated with 10 or 15 mm LiCl for 6 h. After two washes with minimum essential medium, apoptosis was induced by 0.5 μm staurosporine for 3 h, and tau cleavage was analyzed by Western blot. Tau dephosphorylation and cleavage were also assessed in cultures exposed for different time periods (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h) to 1 μm colchicine. Colchicine is a toxin known to depolymerize microtubules, to destabilize the cytoskeleton, and to dephosphorylate tau (27Merrick S.E. Demoise D.C. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5589-5594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 28Bonfoco E. Ceccatelli S. Manzo L. Nicotera P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 218: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Colchicine exposure was also carried out with 25 or 50 nm OKA for 8 h. Tau Fractionation—Fractionation was performed as described by Jenkins et al. (29Jenkins S.M. Zinnerman M. Garner C. Johnson V.W. Biochem. J. 2000; 275: 263-270Crossref Google Scholar). To determine whether tau cleavage occurred during fractionation into soluble and bound tau, fractionation was carried out at 37 °C for 10 and 20 min in buffer with or without the pan caspase inhibitor, Boc-d-FMK. This buffer also contained protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures. Protein extracts were then mixed with 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heat-denatured for 8 min at 90 °C. Western Blot—Cells in 35-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and total proteins were extracted by scraping the cells in 100 μl of modified Laemmli sample buffer (60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, phosphatase inhibitor mixture I, protease inhibitor mixture I (Sigma), 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μm okadaic acid, 1 μg/ml N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml Nα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were then sonicated on ice and centrifuged. The resulting supernatants were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Samples were mixed with 50 mm dithiothreitol and 0.5% β-mercaptoethanol and heated at 90 °C for 5–8 min. Depending on the primary antibody used in Western blot, 25–50 μg of total protein was separated by electrophoresis on 4–20% gradient SDS-acrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and probed with the indicated antibodies. After incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (DAKO, Denmark), Western blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham Biosciences). Western blots were analyzed by densitometry (Bio-Rad gel doc 2000 imaging system). Phosphorylated and dephosphorylated tau levels (detected by phospho-dependent anti-tau antibodies) were normalized to total tau (detected by Tau-5 antibody), which in turn was normalized to β-actin. Immunohistochemistry—Cell cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. Double immunostainings were carried out using AT-8 and Tau-1 antibodies. These two monoclonal antibodies were simultaneously revealed by goat secondary antibodies (Clinisciences, France), which recognize mouse IgG subclasses. AT-8 (IgG1κ) was revealed by an anti-IgG1 antibody coupled to TRITC and Tau-1 (IgG2a) with an anti-IgG2a antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate. To determine whether apoptosis-altered localization of dephosphorylated tau was due to tau cleavage or to its dephosphorylation, we carried out double immunostainings with the polyclonal anti-total (phosphorylation-independent epitope) tau antibody, Tau-G, and with the anti-dephosphorylated tau antibody, Tau-1. Tau staining with Tau-G was detected by a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody coupled to TRITC, and labeling with Tau-1 was revealed by goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Jackson Laboratories). To visualize apoptosis, all immunostainings were combined to the nuclear staining with DAPI. Image acquisition was monitored with a charge-coupled device camera (Photonic science) using Visiolab 2000 software (Biocom, France). Data were statistically analyzed using Student's t test and considered significantly different when p < 0.05. During Neuronal Apoptosis, for the Majority of Phospho-Tau Epitopes Analyzed, an Increase in Tau Phosphorylation Precedes Tau Dephosphorylation and Cleavage—It is largely admitted that tau phosphorylation increases during neuronal apoptosis (16Davis P.K. Johnson G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35686-35692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Johnson G.V. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 2346-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). On the other hand, data from several previous studies (18Canu N. Dus L. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Brancolini C. Rinaldi A.M. Novak M. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lesort M. Blanchard C. Yardin C. Esclaire F. Hugon J. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Mills J. Lee V.M. Pittman R.N. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 625-636PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that apoptosis is more closely associated with increased tau dephosphorylation. To understand these apparently conflicting data, we analyzed the alterations in tau phosphorylation during the time course of neuronal apoptosis. Western blots shown in Fig. 1 were carried out using proteins extracted in modified Laemmli sample buffer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In control cultures all anti-tau antibodies detected a 55- to 56-kDa major band and a 60- to 62-kDa minor band. These bands represent uncleaved tau proteins (full-length tau = Tau FL) (Fig. 1A). Only the 55- to 56-kDa band was semi-quantified by densitometry. Western blots using anti-phosphorylated tau antibodies, AT-8, AT-180, AT-270, and AD-2 showed that 0.5 μm staurosporine induced transient increases in phosphorylated tau. The changes in tau phosphorylation depended upon the phosphorylation epitope analyzed. At AT-8, AT-180, and AT-270 epitopes, the increase in phosphorylated tau occurred after 15 min of staurosporine exposure (Fig. 1A) and peaked after 45 min of exposure (see Fig. 1B for densitometric analysis of Western blots presented in Fig. 1A). For example, at the AT-8 epitope, phosphorylated tau comprised 175% of controls following 45-min staurosporine exposure. Similarly, for the AD-2 epitope, the increase in phosphorylated tau was observed at 15 min, but peaked only at 2-h staurosporine exposure. For all tau phosphorylation epitopes analyzed, except at the 12E8 epitope, a decrease in phosphorylated tau was observed after the initial increase. For the AT-8 epitope, this decrease occurred 1 h after staurosporine exposure (compared with the increase seen at 45 min). At 24-h staurosporine exposure, no AT-8 immunoreactivity was detected. These variations (increase and then decrease) in phosphorylated tau were then confirmed by Western blots using Tau-1 antibody, which recognizes tau only when serines 195, 198, 199, 202, and threonine 205 are not phosphorylated. Dephosphorylated tau detected by Tau-1 antibody showed an early (within 15-min staurosporine exposure compared with controls) decrease and then started to increase after 1 h and continued until 24-h staurosporine exposure (Fig. 1, A and C). In contrast to what was observed for the majority of tau phosphorylation epitopes, staurosporine induced a decrease in tau phosphorylation at the 12E8 epitope. This decrease was observed at 15-min staurosporine exposure and was maintained even when exposure to staurosporine was prolonged until 24 h (Fig. 1, A and B). Tau Cleavage Is Associated with Its Dephosphorylation and Is Correlated with the Occurrence of Apoptotic Features—Western blots using anti-dephosphorylated tau antibody, Tau-1, showed that tau dephosphorylation increased greatly following 8-h staurosporine exposure compared with 45-min exposure (Fig. 1C). This increase was associated with tau cleavage, which coincided with the occurrence of morphological features of apoptosis (chromatin fragmentation, cell body retraction, and loss of neurite outgrowth, see below). Following 8-, 16-, and 24-h staurosporine exposures, Tau-1 detected a laddering of dephosphorylated tau, including a final tau fragment of ∼15 kDa (Fig. 1A). This fragment was already detected following 4-h exposure, and its levels increased with the percentages of apoptotic neurons (Fig. 1C). Apoptosis was 23.6% (p < 0.01), 51.2% (p < 0.001), and 70.8%, following 4-, 8-, and 16-h staurosporine exposures, respectively, and the corresponding intensity values of the 15-kDa fragment were 14 (arbitrary units), 28, and 106. There was no correlation between the increase in tau phosphorylation and the percentage of apoptotic neurons. Chung et al. (30Chung C.W. Song Y.H. Kim I.K. Yoon W.J. Ryu B.R. Jo D.G. Woo H.N. Kwon Y.K. Kim H.H. Gwag B.J. Mook-Jung I.H. Jung Y.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) demonstrated that tau cleavage occurred during staurosporine-induced neuronal apoptosis of cultured cortical neurons. This cleavage led to a 50-kDa fragment, which represented residues 1–421. In addition, using an acellular system, these authors demonstrated that recombinant tau protein could be cleaved by caspase-3 at Asp421. These data were recently confirmed by Gamblin et al. (24Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In that study, tau cleavage was reported to occur during apoptosis of cultured neurons exposed to amyloid β-(1–42). This cleavage generated a truncated tau protein that lacked its 20 C-terminal amino acids. The truncated protein corresponded to the 50-kDa fragment and had an increased ability to assemble into filaments compared with wild-type tau. Both studies showed that the 50-kDa fragment could be detected by Tau-5 antibody, which reacts with residues 210–230 of tau independently of its phosphorylation states. This fragment was also specifically detected by TauC3, a monoclonal anti-cleaved tau antibody directed against residues 412–421 (24Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In our study, when Western blots were carried out using 50 μg of total cellular proteins extracted with modified Laemmli buffer, we detected a faint 45-kDa tau fragment with anti-phosphorylated tau antibody AD-2 within 15 min of staurosporine exposure (Fig. 1A). Anti-phosphorylated tau antibody, AT-8, and anti-phospho-independent tau antibody, Tau-5, barely detected a 50-kDa tau fragment, by contrast with what was reported by Chung et al. (30Chung C.W. Song Y.H. Kim I.K. Yoon W.J. Ryu B.R. Jo D.G. Woo H.N. Kwon Y.K. Kim H.H. Gwag B.J. Mook-Jung I.H. Jung Y.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and Gamblin et al. (24Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N.

In accordance with data reported by Canu et al. (18Canu N. Dus L. Barbato C. Ciotti M.T. Brancolini C. Rinaldi A.M. Novak M. Cattaneo A. Bradbury A. Calissano P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7061-7074Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we showed that only the anti-dephosphorylated tau antibody (Tau-1) was able to detect a sharp laddering of apoptosis-generated fragments, mainly a 15-kDa tau fragment (Fig. 1A) (17 kDa for Canu et al.). When normalized to actin, total tau detected by Tau-5 decreased time-dependently during staurosporine exposure (Fig. 1D). We then tried to understand why we failed to detect sharp tau fragments with phospho-dependent and phospho-independent tau antibodies as previously described (24Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In particular, we investigated whether this result could be to differences under “Experimental Procedures” used in the different studies. Western blots presented in Fig. 1 of the present work were carried out in modified Laemmli sample buffer containing 2% ionic detergent SDS and phosphatase and protease inhibitors. Chung et al. (30Chung C.W. Song Y.H. Kim I.K. Yoon W.J. Ryu B.R. Jo D.G. Woo H.N. Kwon Y.K. Kim H.H. Gwag B.J. Mook-Jung I.H. Jung Y.K. Neurobiol. Dis. 2001; 8: 162-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) used Laemmli sample buffer without phosphatase and protease inhibitors, whereas Gamblin et al. (24Gamblin T.C. Chen F. Zambrano A. Abraha A. Lagalwar S. Guillozet A.L. Lu M. Fu Y. Garcia-Sierra F. LaPointe N. Miller R. Berry R.W. Binder L.I. Cryns V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10032-10037Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) carried out cell extracts in stabilizing buffer that contained 1% non-ionic detergent Triton and a small amount of SDS (0.1%). The difference between the buffer that we used and the buffer used by Chung et al. is the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. We first performed Western blots on cells lysed with Laemmli buffer without protease and phosphatase inhibitors. However, we again failed to observe sharp and easily detectable tau fragments with anti-phospho-independent and phospho-dependent tau antibodies, as described by Chung et al. (data not shown). We then used a buffer containing Triton as detergent and protease and phosphatase inhibitors to carry out cell extracts as described by Jenkins et al. (29Jenkins S.M. Zinnerman M. Garner C.

https://openalex.org/W2066308207,"To gain insight into the mechanisms of molecular recognition and humoral immune response in ovarian cancer, we used fingerprinting, a phage display-based combinatorial selection to isolate peptide ligands to tumor-related antibodies present in ascites from patients with advanced disease. First, we have isolated a consensus motif (sequence CVPELGHEC) in 86% of the peptides screened; this enriched motif was selected from a total of 10(8)-10(9) unique random sequences present in the library. Next, we identified the heat-shock protein 90 kDa (HSP90) as the native antigen mimicked by the motif. Finally, we evaluated the expression of HSP90 and the presence of antibodies against the HSP90-mimic peptide in a large panel of ovarian cancer patients and controls. In tissue microarrays, we show that the expression of HSP90 is ubiquitous. However, the corresponding humoral immune response against HSP90 is restricted to a subset of patients with stage IV disease. Together, these results show that screening humoral response can identify tumor antigens that may serve as molecular targets in ovarian cancer. Recognition of such relevant proteins in the immunobiology of malignant tumors may lead to the development of therapies"

https://openalex.org/W1965321324,"On nociceptive neurons, one important mechanism to generate pain signals is the activation of P2X(3) receptors, which are membrane proteins gated by extracellular ATP. In the presence of the agonist, P2X(3) receptors rapidly desensitize and then recover slowly. One unique property of P2X(3) receptors is the recovery acceleration by extracellular Ca(2+) that can play the role of the gain-setter of receptor function only when P2X(3) receptors are desensitized. To study negatively charged sites potentially responsible for this action of Ca(2+), we mutated 15 non-conserved aspartate or glutamate residues in the P2X(3) receptor ectodomain with alanine and expressed such mutated receptors in human embryonic kidney cells studied with patch clamping. Unlike most mutants, D266A (P2X(3) receptor numbering) desensitized very slowly, indicating that this residue is important for generating desensitization. Recovery appeared structurally distinct from desensitization because E111A and D266A had a much faster recovery and D220A and D289A had a much slower one despite their standard desensitization. Furthermore, E161A, E187A, or E270A mutants showed lessened sensitivity to the action of extracellular Ca(2+), suggesting that these determinants were important for the effect of this cation on desensitization recovery. This study is the first report identifying several negative residues in the P2X(3) receptor ectodomain differentially contributing to the general process of receptor desensitization. At least one residue was important to enable the development of rapid desensitization, whereas others controlled recovery from it or the facilitating action of Ca(2+). Thus, these findings outline diverse potential molecular targets to modulate P2X(3) receptor function in relation to its functional state."

https://openalex.org/W2158605824,"Flat colorectal tumors, characterized by high-grade dysplasia from early small flat mucosal lesions, exhibit a relatively aggressive clinical behavior and are known for their infrequent K-ras mutations. In this study, we investigated the methylation status of the RASSF1A promoter in association with 3p LOH and K-ras mutations in 48 flat colorectal tumors (39 early carcinomas and nine intramucosal high-grade dysplasias). RASSF1A hypermethylation was detected in 39 of 48 (81.3%) tumors and RASSF1A methylation was also detected in 19 of 39 (49%) normal colonic mucosal tissues. 3p21.3 LOH was detected in 20 of 42 (47.6%) cases, but RASSF1 methylation was detected in cases with LOH (14 cases) and retention of 3p21.3 (20 cases). K-ras mutations were detected in seven of 48 (14.6%) tumors and the concordant occurrence of K-ras mutation and RASSF1A methylation was detected in three of 48 cases (6.3%). Overall, there was a statistically significant mutually exclusive relationship between K-ras mutations and RASSF1A methylation. In conclusion, promoter hypermethylation of RASSF1A is a frequent event and may start early in the background normal mucosa in this tumor type. An alternative cascade of abnormalities in RAS transduction pathways may be responsible for the flat morphology and aggressive nature of flat colorectal neoplasms."
https://openalex.org/W1967814083,"Deletions of the 3p arm have been detected in various solid tumors, but no study to date has investigated this deletion in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Recently, we demonstrated that 3p14.2 was deleted in approximately 30% of DLBCL cases by use of a genome-wide array-comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). For a more detailed examination of the genomic losses at 3p14.2, here we made use of contig BAC array for 3p14.2, and found that 12 DLBCL samples displayed losses. All of the deleted regions were located within the fragile histidine triad (FHIT) gene, and the most frequent region of loss was mapped to 0.4 Mbp of the region encompassing the introns 4 and 5 and exon 5 of the FHIT gene. Concomitant analysis of transcripts showed that the FHIT gene was aberrantly transcribed in 31% of the DLBCL samples examined and that the lost exons of the aberrant transcripts were correlated with genomic deletions. These findings indicate that (1) loss of genomic material at 3q14.2 is responsible for exon losses of the FHIT gene, and (2) genomic loss of the FHIT gene is one of the causes of the generation of aberrant transcripts."
https://openalex.org/W2060299714,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent regulator of vascular function through its control of multiple endothelial cell functions. In addition to its key role in vascularization, VEGF has recently been shown to have neurotrophic activity during hypoxic stress. In the central and peripheral motor nervous system, VEGF treatment increased neuronal vascularization and perfusion, as well as having direct trophic effects on neurons and Schwann cells. However, the role of VEGF in the sensory nervous system remains unclear. To characterize the differential effects of VEGF on endothelial cells and neurons in sensory ganglia, we used explanted mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a culture system containing neurons and endothelial cells in close apposition. We show that VEGF is expressed by neurons and satellite cells, but not by endothelial cells or pericytes. On the other hand, the tyrosine kinase VEGF receptor VEGFR-2 was robustly expressed by endothelial cells throughout the extensive DRG capillary network, but not found at either the transcript or protein level in sensory neurons or other nonendothelial cells of the DRG. Both soluble receptor sequestration of VEGF and small molecule kinase inhibition of VEGFR-2 signaling rapidly disrupted the connectivity, branching, and structural integrity of the capillary network of embryonic DRG; this effect was no longer evident postnatally. However, VEGF inhibition showed no detectable effect on neuronal health at any stage analyzed. These data suggest that endogenous VEGF is a strict requirement for vascular, but not neuronal, maintenance in developing sensory ganglia."
https://openalex.org/W2041975075,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a highly malignant tumor that is histologically related to skeletal muscle, yet genetic and molecular lesions underlying its genesis and progression remain largely unknown. In this study we have compared the molecular profiles of two different mouse models of RMS, each associated with a defined primary genetic defect known to play a role in rhabdomyosarcomagenesis in man. We report that RMS of heterozygous Patched1 (Ptch1) mice show less aggressive growth and a greater degree of differentiation than RMS of heterozygous p53 mice. By means of cDNA microarray analysis we demonstrate that RMS in Ptch1 mutants predominantly express a number of myogenic markers, including myogenic differentiation 1, myosin heavy chain, actin, troponin and tropomyosin, as well as genes associated with Hedgehog/Patched signaling like insulin-like growth factor 2, forkhead box gene Foxf1 and the growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible gene Gadd45a. In sharp contrast, RMS in p53 mutants display higher expression levels of cell cycle-associated genes like cyclin B1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and the proliferation marker Ki-67. These results demonstrate that different causative mutations lead to distinct gene expression profiles in RMS, which appear to reflect their different biological characteristics. Our results provide a first step towards a molecular classification of different forms of RMS. If the described differences can be confirmed in human RMS our results will contribute to a new molecular taxonomy of this cancer, which will be critical for gene mutation- and expression-specific therapy."

https://openalex.org/W1993631612,"Stem cell factor, also known as Kit ligand (Kitl), belongs to the family of dimeric transmembrane growth factors. Efficient cell surface presentation of Kitl is essential for the migration, proliferation, and survival of melanocytes, germ cells, hemopoietic stem cells, and mastocytes. Here we demonstrate that intracellular transport of Kitl to the cell surface is driven by a motif in the cytoplasmic tail that acts independently of the previously described basolateral sorting signal. Transport of Kitl to the cell surface is controlled at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and requires a C-terminal valine residue positioned at a distance of 19–36 amino acids from the border between the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Deletion or substitution of the valine with other hydrophobic amino acids results in ER accumulation and reduced cell surface transport of Kitl at physiological expression levels. When these mutant proteins are overexpressed in the ER, they are transported by bulk flow to the cell surface albeit at lower efficiency. A fusion construct between Kitl and the green fluorescent protein-labeled extracellular domain of a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein revealed the valine-dependent recruitment into coat protein complex II-coated ER exit sites and vesicular ER to Golgi transport in living cells. Thus the C-terminal valine defines a specific ER export signal in Kitl. It is responsible for the capture of Kitl at coat protein complex II-coated ER exit sites, leading to subsequent cell surface transport under physiological conditions."

https://openalex.org/W2009824664,"To disclose mechanisms of colorectal carcinogenesis and identify novel diagnostic markers and drug targets for treatment of these tumors, we previously analysed the expression profiles of 11 colorectal cancers using a genome-wide cDNA microarray containing 23 040 genes. Among the genes commonly transactivated in the cancers, we identified a novel human gene, which we termed CLUAP1 (clusterin-associated protein 1). It encodes a nuclear protein of 413 amino acids containing a coiled-coil domain. To investigate its function, we searched for CLUAP1-interacting proteins using yeast two-hybrid system and identified nuclear Clusterin. Expression of CLUAP1 was gradually increased in the late S to G2/M phases of cell cycle and it returned to the basal level in the G0/G1 phases. Suppression of this gene by short interfering RNAs resulted in growth retardation in the transfected cells. These data provide better understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis, and inactivation of CLUAP1 may conceivably serve in the future as a novel therapeutic intervention for treatment of colon cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2348955214,"The mutant of Ras protein with serine to asparagine mutation at residue 17 (Ras–17N) is known to interfere with the signaling function of the wild-type Ras protein by sequestering its guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). The similar mutant of another Ras family protein Rap1 (Rap1–17N) fails to effectively interfere with the interaction between the wild-type Rap1 and one of its GEFs, C3G, in vitro. In the present study, we have attempted to isolate Rap1 mutants with increased affinity for C3G using random mutagenesis and yeast two-hybrid screening. Based on the pattern of mutations found among these mutants, we could design a potent C3G-binder, named Rap1-AGE, harboring mutations in three sites (17A, 29G, and 117E). The association of Rap1-AGE with C3G in the cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. The ability of Rap1-AGE to inhibit C3G-mediated Rap1-activation and cell spreading was also demonstrated. On the other hand, Rap1 activation mediated by two other GEFs, Epac and smgGDS, was not inhibited by Rap1-AGE. These results suggest that Rap1-AGE acts as a dominant interfering factor against C3G and serves as a useful tool in analyzing the roles of C3G-Rap1 signaling pathway in various biological processes."
