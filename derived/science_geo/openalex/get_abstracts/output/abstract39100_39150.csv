https://openalex.org/W1969176764,The invasion of tumor cells through basement membranes is a critical step in the formation of metastases. The binding of the malignant cells to laminin in the basement membranes allows their attachment and activates their invasiveness. Recently a synthetic nonapeptide from the B1 chain sequence of laminin was identified as a major site for cell binding. A pentapeptide within the nonapeptide sequence was found to reduce the formation of lung colonies in mice injected with melanoma cells and also to inhibit the invasiveness of the cells in vitro.

(1984) Diabetes 33, 401-404). In screening the regenerating islet-derived cDNA library, we came across a novel gene encoding a 165-amino acid protein. The gene was expressed in regenerating islets but not in normal pancreatic islets, insulinomas, or regenerating liver. In 90% depancreatized and nicotinamide-injected rats, the expression of the gene was increased 1 month after the partial pancreatectomy and reached a peak 3 months after the operation. The increase in expression of the gene was temporally correlated with the increase in size of regenerating islets and the decrease in urinary glucose level. The gene was also found to be activated in hyperplastic islets of aurothioglucose-treated mice. Thus, the expression of the gene in both regenerating and hyperplastic islets suggests possible roles for this gene in replication, growth, and maturation of islet beta-cells. We also found that a human pancreas-derived cDNA library contained a homologue to the gene."

https://openalex.org/W2052436795,"We establish that the position-specific antigen 2 (PS2), a Drosophila cell surface glycoprotein complex, is an invertebrate member of the vertebrate fibronectin receptor (integrin) family. New monoclonal antibodies show that in Drosophila embryos and larvae PS2 α subunits have a size of ca. 140 kd. Analysis of cDNA and genomic clones revealed that the canonical PS2 α subunit contains 1394 amino acids and has extensive homology to the heavy and light chains of integrin α subunits. The distribution of the PS2 antigen is regulated at the level of PS2 α subunit mRNA. In early Drosophila development the protein is restricted to mesoderm and appears to be involved in muscle attachment. We suggest that PS2, like vertebrate fibronectin receptors, mediates changes in cell shape and cell-extracellular matrix adhesion by binding to a basement membrane protein."
https://openalex.org/W1482593432,"Exposure of the purified Ca2+ pump of human erythrocytes to chymotrypsin led to the rapid loss of calmodulin activation. A fragment of about 12 kDa was removed from the ATPase in 1-2 min. Blotting experiments with 125I-labeled calmodulin showed that this fragment contains the calmodulin binding region. The remainder of the ATPase molecule was degraded to a number of fragments ranging from 3 to 120 kDa; none of them bound calmodulin. To isolate the calmodulin binding domain, calmodulin which had been coupled to the Denny-Jaffe reagent (a cleavable radioactive photoaffinity cross-linker) was allowed to bind to the Ca2+ pump. After illumination to couple the cross-linker to the pump, the cleavable bond was split and the calmodulin removed, leaving the pump radioactively labeled. This pump was digested with chymotrypsin, and the products were separated by gel permeation chromatography. The only radioactive peak (migrating at about 12 kDa) was further purified on reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Amino acid analysis showed the fragment to have a minimal molecular mass of 12.4 kDa and to contain a single methionine. After attempts to sequence the peptide directly failed. CNBr digestion was carried out on the labeled ATPase, producing both soluble and insoluble labeled material. After reverse-phase HPLC purification of the soluble material, a single radioactive peak was collected. Its sequence was (Formula: see text). A portion of this peak was passed through a microcalmodulin column; it bound in the presence of Ca2+ and was eluted by EDTA, and by a mixture of EDTA and urea. Staphylococcal V8 protease digestion of the eluted peak produced the same sequence as shown above, but starting at Leu-2 and ending at Glu-32. Structural analysis of this peptide showed that it shares features with the calmodulin binding domains of other enzymes which are regulated by calmodulin."
https://openalex.org/W1597157477,"We have cloned and sequenced the full-length cDNA for the human cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor from four overlapping clones. The 9104-nucleotide sequence contains 7473 nucleotides which encode a protein of 2491 amino acids. The amino acid sequence includes a putative signal sequence of 40 amino acids, an extracytoplasmic domain consisting of 15 homologous repeat sequences of 134-167 amino acids, a transmembrane region of 23 amino acids, and a cytoplasmic domain of 164 amino acids. The predicted molecular size is greater than 270 kDa. Repeats 7-15 of the extracytoplasmic domain of the human receptor are highly homologous with the sequence recently reported for the partial cDNA for the bovine receptor (Lobel, P., Dahms, N. M., Breitmeyer, J., Chirgwin, J. M., and Kornfeld, S. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 2233-2237). The nucleotide sequence for the full-length cDNA and the deduced amino acid sequence for the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, which are reported here, are strikingly similar (99.8% identical at the nucleotide level and 99.4% identical at the amino acid level) to those recently reported for the human insulin-like growth factor II receptor from HepG2 hepatoma cells (Morgan, D. O., Edman, J.D., Standring, D. N., Fried, V. A., Smith, M. C., Roth, R. A., and Rutter, W. J. (1987) Nature 329, 301-307). These findings support the suggestion that the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor for lysosomal enzymes is a multifunctional binding protein which is identical with the insulin-like growth factor II receptor. A cDNA construct containing the full coding sequence for the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor in the expression vector pSVL was used to transfect COS cells. Expression of the cDNA in transfected COS cells produced a cell-surface protein which co-migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with authentic human receptor, bound to an affinity column and was specifically eluted with mannose 6-phosphate, mediated cell-surface binding and endocytosis of beta-glucuronidase, and targeted the endocytosed enzyme to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1498772725,"We have isolated and sequenced cDNA clones encoding the entire sequence of the bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. The deduced 2499-amino acid precursor has a calculated molecular mass of 275 kDa. Analysis of the sequence indicates that the protein has a 44-residue amino-terminal signal sequence, a 2269-residue extracytoplasmic region, a single 23-residue transmembrane region, and a 163-residue carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic region. The extra-cytoplasmic region consists of 15 contiguous repeating domains, one of which contains a 43-residue insertion that is similar to the type II repeat of fibronectin. The 15 domains have an average size of 147 amino acids and a distinctive pattern of 8 cysteine residues. Alignment of the 15 domains and the extracytoplasmic domain of the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor shows that all have sequence similarities and suggests that all are homologous."
https://openalex.org/W1530754259,"The bovine cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) and the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) receptor have recently been shown to be 80% identical in their amino acid sequences as deduced from cDNA clones (Morgan, D. O., Edman, J. C., Standring, D. N., Fried, V. A., Smith, M. C., Roth, R. A., and Rutter, W. J. (1987) Nature 329, 301-307). We have studied the binding of IGF-II to affinity-purified CI-MPR in order to obtain direct evidence that the same protein binds mannose 6-phosphate-containing ligands and IGF-II. In equilibrium binding studies, the CI-MPR bound 0.95 mol of IGF-II/mol of receptor with a Kd of 0.2 nM. The pH optimum of binding was 7.4. The addition of mannose 6-phosphate did not affect binding, indicating that the two ligands interact with different binding sites on the receptor. IGF-I bound to the receptor with a much lower affinity (Kd of 0.4 microM), and insulin binding could not be detected. IGF-II did not bind to the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor. We conclude that the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor and the IGF-II receptor are the same protein."
https://openalex.org/W2048630205,"The RNA8 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes an unusually large (260 kd) protein required for pre-mRNA splicing. Immunological procedures have been used to demonstrate that the RNA8 protein is in stable association with the small nuclear RNAs snR7L and snR7S, which are also known to be required for splicing and which are present in spliceosomal complexes. RNA8 is also involved in an ATP-dependent association with two other small nuclear RNAs, snR14 and snR6. It is proposed that this represents an ATP-dependent interaction between small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles that precedes their entry into the spliceosome."
https://openalex.org/W2034926697,"Two human helper T cell determinants in influenza have been identified, one in the hemagglutinin and the other in the matrix protein (M1). Both were shown to be DR1 restricted by using transfected L cells to present antigen. Comparison of the sequences of the two peptides revealed a similar pattern that could account for their DR1 specificity if the peptides adopt a helical conformation. The model was supported by the demonstration that hybrid peptides, composed of the amino acids that interact with DR1 from one determinant and the residues that interact with the T cell receptor from the other, were recognized by each clone. The generality of the motif was confirmed by the finding that DR1 individuals respond to a ragweed peptide containing the defined pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1578846125,"We have previously shown that inhibition of the ATPase activity of skeletal muscle myosin subfragment 1 (S1) by caldesmon is correlated with the inhibition of S1 binding in the presence of ATP or pyrophosphate (Chalovich, J., Cornelius, P., and Benson, C. (1987) J. Biol Chem. 262, 5711-5716). In contrast, Lash et al. (Lash, J., Sellers, J., and Hathaway, D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 16155-16160) have shown that the inhibition of ATPase activity of smooth muscle heavy meromyosin (HMM) by caldesmon is correlated with an increase in the binding of HMM to actin in the presence of ATP. We now show, in agreement, that caldesmon does increase the binding of smooth muscle HMM to actin-tropomyosin while decreasing the ATPase activity. The effect of caldesmon on the binding of smooth HMM is reversed by Ca2+-calmodulin. Caldesmon strengthens the binding of smooth S1.ATP and skeletal HMM.ATP to actin-tropomyosin but to a lesser extent than smooth HMM.ATP. Furthermore, this increase in binding of smooth S1.ATP and skeletal HMM.ATP does not parallel the inhibition of ATPase activity. In contrast, in the absence of ATP, all smooth and skeletal myosin subfragments compete with caldesmon for binding to actin. Thus, the effect that caldesmon has on the binding of myosin subfragments to actin-tropomyosin depends on the source of myosin, the type of subfragment, and the nucleotide present. The inhibition of actin-activated ATP hydrolysis by caldesmon, however, is not greatly different for different smooth and skeletal myosin subfragments. Evidence is presented that caldesmon inhibits actin-activated ATP hydrolysis by attenuating the productive interaction between myosin and actin that normally accelerates ATP hydrolysis. The increased binding seen by some myosin subfragments, in the presence of ATP, may be due to binding of these subfragments to a nonproductive site on actin-caldesmon. The subfragments which show an increase in binding in the presence of ATP and caldesmon appear to bind directly to caldesmon as demonstrated by affinity chromatography."
https://openalex.org/W1523252823,"Using either inside-out vesicles (IOV) prepared from human erythrocytes or purified Ca2+-ATPase from the same source, the effects of protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) on Ca2+ transport and Ca2+-ATPase activity were measured. Incubation of IOV with protein kinase C in the presence, but not absence, of either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or diolein led to a Ca2+-dependent stimulation of ATP-dependent calcium uptake. The effect was a 5-7-fold increase of Vmax without a significant change in the apparent Km for Ca2+. By comparison, the effect of calmodulin was a 14-fold stimulation of Vmax and a 4-fold reduction in apparent Km. The effect of protein kinase C and calmodulin on Ca2+ uptake were nearly additive. Stimulation of IOV Ca2+ transport by protein kinase C was entirely reversible by treatment of activated IOV with alkaline phosphatase. Incubation of purified Ca2+-ATPase with protein kinase C in the presence of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or diolein led to a stimulation of Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity. These results indicate that protein kinase C stimulates the activity of the plasma membrane Ca2+ pump by a direct effect on the pump protein."
https://openalex.org/W1659495956,"Cooperative calcium binding (apparent Kd = 1.04 X 10(-6) M) to the ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles occurs with a maximal stoichiometry of 2 mols of divalent cation/mol of enzyme in the absence of ATP. The bound calcium is distributed into two pools which undergo fast or slow isotopic exchange, respectively. The two pools retain a 1:1 molar ratio under various conditions and are both located within a protein crevice, as suggested by their cooperative interaction and exchange kinetics. Following enzyme phosphorylation by ATP, both pools of bound calcium are (cannot be displaced by quench reagents). If following 45Ca2+ binding, isotopic dilution is obtained in the medium by adding 40Ca2+ with ATP, internalization of both pools of bound 45Ca2+ (2 mol/mol of phosphoenzyme) is still observed within the first enzyme cycle. When the cycle is reversed by addition of excess ADP soon after ATP, only half of the internalized 45Ca2+ is released from the enzyme into the medium outside the vesicles, while the other half remains with the vesicles. If half of the bound 45Ca2+ is exchanged (fast exchange) with 40Ca2+ previous to the addition of ATP, none of the remaining 45Ca2+ is released outside the vesicles upon reversal of the enzyme cycle. Therefore, the pool of bound calcium which undergoes slower exchange with the outside medium, is the first to be released inside the vesicles upon enzyme phosphorylation. A sequential mechanism of calcium binding and translocation is proposed, that accounts for binding cooperativity and exchange kinetics, presteady state transients following addition of ATP, and the Ca2+ concentration dependence of ATPase activity in steady state."
https://openalex.org/W1504192843,"Functionally mature human T lymphocytes express a cell-surface receptor for antigen (T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3) composed of at least six polypeptides (TCR-alpha and -beta; T3-gamma, -delta, -epsilon, and -zeta). Immature thymocytes and variants of T cell lines lacking one of the TCR.CD3 polypeptide chains fail to express surface receptor and accumulate the other chains intracellularly. Here we show that the assembly of the TCR.CD3 complex within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) began with a core of CD3-gamma, -delta, and -epsilon to which TCR-alpha and -beta bound. A recently described intracellular protein, CD3-omega, participated in the assembly since it was found to be associated with the free TCR-alpha or -beta chains or with the CD3 chains. CD3-omega dissociated as TCR.CD3 complexes were formed in the ER. Association of non-disulfide-linked TCR-alpha and -beta chains with CD3 was detected before that of disulfide-bridged TCR-alpha/beta heterodimers. These data suggest that during assembly, the association of TCR-alpha and -beta chains with the CD3 complex precedes the formation of a TCR-alpha/beta dimer. The existence of intermediates consisting of CD3-gamma, -delta, and -epsilon chains and a single TCR-alpha or -beta chain was also confirmed by using a series of variant T cell lines lacking the TCR-beta or -alpha chain, respectively. Once the single TCR-alpha and -beta chains were associated with CD3, disulfide linkages were formed, and a 70-kDa form of the TCR was detected within the ER. This intracellular precursor of the TCR.CD3 complex was subsequently processed into the mature 90-kDa TCR as the TCR.CD3 complex passed through the Golgi apparatus. Assembly of the TCR.CD3 complex is a rather rapid process, whereas export from the ER occurs at a slow rate. After 1 h, 75% of the receptor complex remained within the ER."

https://openalex.org/W1564094331,"The rat thoracic aortic smooth muscle cell line, A-10, expresses vasopressin receptors of the V1 subtype. Vasopressin treatment of these cells stimulated the release of arachidonic acid and the formation of diacylglycerol and phosphocholine. These responses to vasopressin were inhibited by the V1-specific antagonist SK&F 100273, indicating that these were receptor-mediated phenomena. The mechanisms by which V1 receptors mediate arachidonic acid release appeared to be unaffected by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, suggesting that the release is independent of protein and RNA synthesis. The V1 receptors also appeared to be coupled to a phospholipase C which can hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine, a possible source of the released arachidonic acid. Phosphocholine and diacylglycerol were also generated. The release of arachidonic acid, phosphocholine, or diacylglycerol was not affected by prior treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin (islet-activating protein). Thus, the release of these second messengers is not mediated by the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gi or other pertussis toxin-sensitive substrates. We conclude that V1 receptors induce the release of arachidonic acid and the formation of diacylglycerol and phosphocholine via the activation of both a phosphatidylinositol- and phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C."

A., and Gibbons, I. R. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2337-2342). The decrease in intact heavy chain material is biphasic; in 10 microM Vi, approximately 80% occurs with a half-time of 7 min and the remainder with a half-time of about 90 min, and the yield of cleavage peptides is better than 90%. Loss of dynein ATPase activity appears to be a direct result of the cleavage process and is not significantly affected by the presence of up to 0.1 M cysteamine (CA, 60-23-1) or 2-aminoethyl carbamimidothioic acid dihydrobromide (CA, 56-10-0) as free radical trapping agents. The concentration of Vi required for 50% maximal initial cleavage rate is 4.5 microM, while that for 50% ATPase inhibition is 0.8 microM, both in a 0.6 M NaCl medium. In the presence of 20 microM Vi, CTP and UTP support cleavage at about half the rate of ATP, whereas GTP and ITP support cleavage only if the Vi concentration is raised to about 200 microM. Substitution of any of the transition metal cations Cr2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, or Co2+ for the usual Mg2+ suppresses the photocleavage, presumably by quenching the excited chromophore prior to scission of the heavy chain. The photocleaved dynein 1 binds to dynein-depleted flagella similarly to intact dynein 1, but upon reactivation of the flagella with 1 mM ATP their motility is partially inhibited, rather than being augmented as with intact dynein. These results indicate that Vi acts as a photosensitizing catalyst and suggest that the cleavage proceeds through excitation of Vi bound to dynein at the hydrolytic ATP binding site on each heavy chain, probably in a dynein X MgADP X Vi complex. The exquisite specificity of Vi-sensitized photocleavage will aid the peptide mapping of dynein heavy chains and may be of broader use in studies of protein structure."

This macromolecule will self-assemble into dimers and lesser amounts of oligomers when incubated in neutral isotonic buffer. These molecular species can be separated by zonal velocity sedimentation and assembly is seen to be time- and concentration-dependent. In rotary-shadowed platinum replicas the binding region is found at or near the end of the core at the pole opposite the origin of the heparan sulfate chains. Dimers are double-length structures and oligomers are seen as stellate clusters: in both, the heparan sulfate chains appear peripherally oriented. While isolated cores self-assemble, isolated heparan sulfate chains do not bind intact proteoglycans. Furthermore, proteolytic removal of a non-heparan sulfate containing core moiety destroys the ability of the proteoglycan monomer to form larger species or bind intact proteoglycan, further supporting the binding topography determined morphologically. These negatively charged macromolecular complexes may be important contributors to basement membrane structure and function."

(1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10235-10242), was determined in hepatic nodules of rats initiated by administration of a single dose of carcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine.2HCl (100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) 18 h after partial hepatectomy and promoted by feeding a diet supplemented with 1% orotic acid for 32-40 weeks. N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase III was assayed using glycopeptide GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha 1,6(GlcNAc beta 1,2Man alpha 1,3)Man beta 1, 4GlcNAc beta 1,4GlcNAc-Asn as substrate and, as enzyme sources, microsomal membranes of the hepatic nodules, surrounding liver, regenerating liver, and age- and sex-matched control liver. The nodules had significant N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III activity (0.78-2.18 nmol GlcNAc transferred/h/mg of protein), while the surrounding liver, the regenerating liver (24 h after partial hepatectomy), and the control liver had negligible activity (0.02-0.03 nmol/h/mg of protein). Product isolated from a large scale N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III incubation with hepatic nodules as enzyme source showed the presence of the bisecting GlcNAc residue by 500 MHz proton NMR spectroscopy. Concomitant with the appearance of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III activity in the preneoplastic nodules, the activities of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I and II were decreased in these membranes when compared to those from surrounding liver, regenerating liver, and control liver. These results suggest that N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III is induced at the preneoplastic stage in liver carcinogenesis promoted by orotic acid and are consistent with the reported presence of bisecting GlcNAc residues in the Asn-linked oligosaccharides of rat and human hepatoma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and their absence in enzyme from normal liver of rats and humans (Kobata, A., and Yamashita, K.

https://openalex.org/W1601860320,"Skeletal muscle troponin C (TNC) is structured into two separate domains linked by a nine-turn alpha-helix (D/E helix). It has been demonstrated that calcium binding to the regulatory sites within the N-terminal domain induces conformational changes in the C-terminal domain of isolated TNC. Since the only contact between the two domains is the long D/E helix, the transfer of information must involve conformational changes within this helix. The center of the helix is occupied by a glycine (Gly-92). A postulated mechanism for allowing interdomain interaction involves a conformational change of the D/E helix around Gly-92 (Herzberg, O., and James, M. N. G. (1985) Nature 312, 653-659). We tested this hypothesis using site-directed mutants of troponin C. Two separate mutants containing an alanine and a proline replacing Gly-92 were constructed and compared with wild type TNC. Calcium binding studies showed no significant differences among the TNC species. The different TNC were assembled into thin filaments and used to assay the calcium regulation of actin-activated ATPase of myosin. All TNC species were able to mediate the calcium regulation of ATPase. Under the conditions used for the assays, no differences were detected among the TNC species. These results show that Gly-92 is not essential for the proper interaction of the calcium regulatory sites with the other components of the thin filament, and therefore exclude a large rotation around Gly-92 as the mechanism of information transfer between the two domains of troponin C."
https://openalex.org/W2167135214,"Wheat germ calmodulin (CaM) was derivatized at its single cysteine (Cys27) with either the fluorescent reagent, N-(iodoacetylaminoethyl)-5-naphthylamine-1-sulfonic acid (I-EDANS) or the photoactivable cross-linker benzophenone-4-maleimide. Comparison of the native and derivatized wheat germ CaMs with native bovine testis CaM indicates that the concentrations of these proteins required for half-maximal stimulation of either erythrocyte membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity or cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum phosphorylation are very similar. Affinity labeling of troponin subunits with 125I- and benzophenone-4-maleimide-labeled CaM demonstrates CaM binding to troponin I (TnI) and troponin T (TnT) in binary complexes, as well as to both subunits in the CaM.TnI.TnT ternary complex. This suggests that both subunits are within 10 A of Cys27 of calmodulin. Affinity labeling of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles with 125I- and benzophenone-4-maleimide-labeled CaM exhibits a Ca2+- and Mg2+-dependent labeling of phospholamban, as shown previously with bovine calmodulin (Louis, C.F., and Jarvis, B. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 15187-15191). Thus, it appears that Ca2+-binding site I of calmodulin is at or near binding sites of calmodulin for TnI, TnT, and phospholamban. Analysis of the time-resolved fluorescence decay curves of I-EDANS-labeled calmodulin indicates a major component with a lifetime of 11.9 ns (+Ca2+), which accounts for 81% of the total fluorescence. The lifetime decreases slightly to 11.3 ns in the absence of Ca2+. Fluorescence anisotropy experiments indicate that I-EDANS-labeled CaM binds TnI with Kd = 6 x 10(-8) M in the presence of Ca2+. This study suggests that these single-site derivatives will be useful for characterizing a variety of calmodulin-receptor interactions because they lack ambiguities inherent in less specific labeling methods."

In this study, it is demonstrated that the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor from detergent solutions of EL-4 cells can be stably adsorbed to nitrocellulose with full retention of IL-1 binding activity. This assay system was used to monitor the purification of the IL-1 receptor and to investigate the effects of several chemical modifications on receptor binding activity. IL-1 receptors extracted from EL-4 6.1 C10 cells can be bound to and specifically eluted from IL-1 alpha coupled to Sepharose. The affinity chromatography method resulted in the identification by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining of a protein of Mr 82,000 that was present in fractions exhibiting IL-1 binding activity. Experiments in which the cell-surface proteins of EL-4 cells were radiolabeled and 125I-labeled receptor was purified by affinity chromatography suggested that the Mr 82,000 protein was expressed on the plasma membrane. N-Glycanase treatment of this material showed that 23-35% of the total Mr (82,000) of the receptor is N-linked carbohydrate."
https://openalex.org/W1525941447,"The length and amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal region of troponin T (TnT) is regulated by alternative mRNA processing in both mammals and birds. To study the function of this region, three forms of bovine cardiac TnT were compared: isoforms TnT1 and TnT2, which differ by the presence or absence of residues 15-19 and TnT 39-284. TnT 39-284 was prepared by chemical cleavage of TnT1 at Cys-39. All three forms of TnT successfully reconstituted with troponin I and troponin C, resulting in troponins designated Tn1, Tn2, and TnCN. Three properties of the reconstituted troponins were compared. 1) Tn1 and TnCN had indistinguishable effects on tropomyosin polymerization. Addition of either 8 microM Tn1 or 8 microM TnCN increased the viscosity (eta rel) of 5 microM tropomyosin from 1.0 to 1.63 at 10 degrees C. 2) All of the three troponins conferred Ca2+ dependence to the MgATPase rate of myosin S-1-actin-tropomyosin. In the presence of saturating concentrations of Tn2, Tn1, or TnCN, 50% MgATPase activation occurred at pCa 6.0, 5.9, or 5.75, respectively. 3) The affinity of the Ca2+-specific binding site of reconstituted Tn1 was 50% stronger than the affinity of the same site on TnCN. These results suggest that the amino-terminal region of cardiac TnT is not a completely Ca2+-insensitive domain, but rather modulates the interaction of Ca2+ with troponin and with the thin filament. Furthermore, the effects of TnT on tropomyosin-tropomyosin binding are predominantly due to portions of TnT carboxyl-terminal to residue 38."

Radiolabeled [( 14C] methylamine and 36Cl-) and fluorescent (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated low density lipoproteins) probes were used to assess internal pH (pHi) and delta psi. In the absence of ATP, pHi averaged 7.37 +/- 0.05 (extracellular pH 7.31 +/- 0.02), and delta psi ranged from -32 to -71 mV; but neither pHi nor delta psi varied consistently with [Cl-]. In the presence of ATP, pHi decreased progressively with increasing [Cl-] to a plateau value of about 5.89 at greater than or equal to 25 mM Cl-, and MVB exhibited an interior positive delta psi that was maximal at the lowest Cl- concentration (+65.5 mV) and decreased as medium Cl- increased. The total ATP-dependent proton electrochemical gradient (proton-motive force (delta p] averaged 118.0 +/- 4.3 mV and did not change in any consistent manner as [Cl-] varied almost 300-fold. However, initial rates of MVB acidification increased with increasing [Cl-]. These studies indicate that: (a) in the absence of ATP, isolated MVB exhibited a negative delta psi, probably a Donnan potential; (b) in the presence of ATP and at a [Cl-] similar to that in hepatocyte cytoplasm (25 mM), MVB pHi was 5.89, and delta psi was +9.6 mV; and (c) over the range of [Cl-] tested, the magnitudes of delta pH and delta psi were inversely related, apparently related to Cl- availability, but the ATP-dependent delta p did not vary. Therefore, it is concluded that Cl- increases the initial rate of vesicle acidification in MVB and also affects the relative chemical and electrical contributions of the steady-state proton pump-determined delta p. Cl-, however, does not alter steady-state delta p."
https://openalex.org/W1931595926,"Rat liver endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes were investigated for the presence of proteins having structural relationships with sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) proteins. Western immunoblots of ER proteins probed with polyclonal antibodies raised against the 100-kDa SR Ca-ATPase of rabbit skeletal muscle identified a single reactive protein of 100 kDa. Also, the antibody inhibited up to 50% the Ca-ATPase activity of isolated ER membranes. Antisera raised against the major intraluminal calcium binding protein of rabbit skeletal muscle SR, calsequestrin (CS), cross-reacted with an ER peptide of about 63 kDa, by the blotting technique. Stains-All treatment of slab gels showed that the cross-reactive peptide stained metachromatically blue, similarly to SR CS. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (Michalak, M., Campbell, K. P., and MacLennan, D. H. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1317-1326) of ER proteins showed that the CS-like component of liver ER, similarly to skeletal CS, fell off the diagonal line, as expected from the characteristic pH dependence of the rate of mobility of mammalian CS. In addition, the CS-like component of liver ER was released from the vesicles by alkaline treatment and was found to be able to bind calcium, by a 45Ca overlay technique. From these findings, we conclude that a 100-kDa membrane protein of liver ER is the Ca-ATPase, and that the peripheral protein in the 63-kDa range is closely structurally and functionally related to skeletal CS."
https://openalex.org/W1531143993,"The polymerization of actin from rabbit skeletal muscle by myosin subfragment 1 (S-1) from the same source was studied in the depolymerizing G-actin buffer. The polymerization reactions were monitored in light-scattering experiments over a wide range of actin/S-1 molar rations. In contrast to the well resolved nucleation-elongation steps of actin assembly by KC1 and Mg2+, the association of actin in the presence of S-1 did not reveal any lag in the polymerization reaction. Light scattering titrations of actin with S-1 and vice versa showed saturation of the polymerization reaction at stoichiometric 1:1 ratios of actin to S-1. Ultracentrifugation experiments confirmed that only stoichiometric amounts of actin were incorporated into a 1:1 acto-S-1 polymer even at high actin/S-1 ratios. These polymers were indistinguishable from standard complexes of S-1 with F-actin as judged by electron microscopy, light scattering measurements, and fluorescence changes observed while using actin covalently labeled with N-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide. F-actin obtained by polymerization of G-actin by S-1 could initiate rapid assembly of G-actin in the presence of 10 mM KC1 and 0.5 mM MgCl2 and showed normal activation of MgATPase hydrolysis by myosin."
https://openalex.org/W1559456361,"We report here on the UV-induced vanadate-dependent cleavage of the alpha and beta heavy chains of the outer arm dynein from Chlamydomonas flagella. Both polypeptides are cleaved at a single site (termed the V1 site) by UV irradiation in the presence of Mg2+, ATP, and vanadate. The alpha chain yields fragments of Mr 290,000 and 190,000. Fragments of Mr 255,000 and 185,000 are obtained from the beta chain. Ultraviolet irradiation of the alpha and beta chains in the presence of vanadate and Mn2+ (but no nucleotide) induces cleavage of both molecules at sites (termed the V2 sites) distinct from the V1 sites. The single V2 site within the beta chain is located 75,000 daltons from the site of V1 cleavage within the Mr 255,000 V1 fragment. The alpha chain contains three distinct sites of V2 cleavage; all are located within the Mr 290,000 V1 fragment, 60,000, 90,000, and 100,000 daltons from the site of V1 cleavage. From these studies, we estimate the masses of the alpha and beta heavy chains to be 480,000 and 440,000 daltons, respectively."

All fractions contain components that support the formation of splicing intermediates (the cleaved 5′ exon and the intron-exon 2 lariat). At least one of the fractions also contains an activity that is essential for the second step in the splicing reaction, namely cleavage at the 3′ splice site and exon ligation. Two of the fractions are enriched in the major small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles U1, U2, U4/U6, and U5. They participate in the formation of the splicing complexes which precedes the cleavage and ligation reactions. The remaining four fractions appear to contain protein factors, as suggested by their resistance to micrococcal nuclease."
https://openalex.org/W1918126646,"The thr operon of Escherichia coli is regulated by an attenuation mechanism in which regulated transcription termination occurs in response to the levels of charged tRNAthr and tRNAile. Transcription of the thr operon regulatory region in vitro produces a 162-base transcript that is terminated efficiently at the attenuator. The attenuator sequence is similar to other rho-independent terminators. It contains a G + C region of dyad symmetry followed by a run of 9 A + T residues. We have characterized in detail the sequence requirements for efficient transcription termination in vitro. Using a set of point mutations in the G + C region of dyad symmetry of the thr attenuator, we have characterized the effects of these mutations on the efficiency of transcription termination. The efficiency was reduced in all of the mutants analyzed with the greatest effect being an approximate 20% decrease in termination. In some instances the electrophoretic mobilities of the terminated transcripts on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels were shifted substantially relative to the wild type-terminated transcript, but the sites of transcription termination were altered by only a few base pairs. We also constructed a set of deletions removing consecutive thymidines which follow the G + C-rich region of dyad symmetry. Removal of 1 or 3 of the 9 thymidine residues had no effect on termination efficiency in vitro or in vivo. Removal of four to six thymidines caused a linear decrease in the efficiency of termination. When only one or two thymidines were present in the template, termination was completely abolished. These results indicate that both the integrity of the RNA stem and the length of the consecutive thymidine residues are important signals recognized by RNA polymerase during transcription of the thr operon regulatory region."
https://openalex.org/W1523340136,"We have identified high and low affinity insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I)-binding sites with mean dissociation constants of 0.37 and 6.25 nM, respectively, in solubilized placental membranes. We have separated these sites and purified the high affinity IGF I receptor 1,300-fold, with an overall yield of 9.9%, using wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography, insulin affinity chromatography, and IGF I affinity chromatography. The Scatchard plot of IGF I binding to the high affinity receptor is linear, suggesting the purification of a single homogeneous class of binding sites. Insulin is two orders of magnitude less effective than IGF I in competitively inhibiting IGF I binding to this receptor. The high affinity IGF I receptor is composed of alpha and beta subunits with apparent molecular weights of 135,500 and 96,200, respectively. IGF I at concentrations of greater than or equal to 50 ng/ml stimulates autophosphorylation of the beta subunit of the purified high affinity receptor 4.6-fold. Low affinity IGF I-binding sites run through the IGF I affinity column or are eluted from the insulin affinity column. The separation of IGF I receptors with different binding affinities by sequential affinity chromatography will make it possible to examine directly the determinants of receptor affinity."
https://openalex.org/W1514755086,"Oscillatory behavior of glycolysis in cell-free extracts of rat skeletal muscle involves bursts of phosphofructokinase activity due to autocatalytic activation by fructose-1,6-P2. Fructose-2,6-P2 is an even more potent activator of phosphofructokinase and is competitive with fructose-1,6-P2 in binding and kinetic studies. The possible role and effects of fructose-2,6-P2 on the oscillating system were therefore examined. When muscle extracts were provided with 1 mM ATP and 10 mM glucose, fructose-2,6-P2 slowly accumulated to 50 nM in 1 h. The nearly monotonic rise, in contrast to the 50-fold oscillations in fructose-1,6-P2, indicated no involvement of fructose-2,6-P2 in the oscillatory process. Addition of 0.5 microM fructose-2,6-P2 blocked the oscillations, and there was negligible appearance of glycolytic intermediates from fructose-1,6-P2 to phosphoenolpyruvate, although similar amounts of lactate accumulated. In the presence of 0.2 microM fructose-2,6-P2, there were small, transient accumulations of fructose-1,6-P2, suggesting aborted activations of phosphofructokinase. Oscillations were not blocked by 0.1 microM fructose-2,6-P2. The average [ATP]/[ADP] ratio in the presence of 0.2 or 0.5 microM fructose-2,6-P2 was half the value in its absence, demonstrating the advantage of the oscillatory behavior in maintaining a high energy state. In the presence of higher, near physiological levels of ATP and citrate, inhibitors which reduce the affinity of phosphofructokinase for fructose-2,6-P2, glycolytic oscillations were not blocked by 1 microM fructose-2,6-P2, its approximate concentration in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1678115372,"Abstract The cytosolic fraction of insulin-treated adipocytes exhibits a 2-fold increase in protein kinase activity when Kemptide is used as a substrate. The detection of insulin-stimulated kinase activity is critically dependent on the presence of phosphatase inhibitors such as fluoride and vanadate in the cell homogenization buffer. The cytosolic protein kinase activity exhibits high sensitivity (ED50 = 2 X 10(-10) M) and a rapid response (maximal after 2 min) to insulin. Kinetic analyses of the cytosolic kinase indicate that insulin increases the Vmax of Kemptide phosphorylation and ATP utilization without affecting the affinities of this enzyme toward the substrate or nucleotide. Upon chromatography on anion-exchange and gel filtration columns, the insulin-stimulated cytosolic kinase activity is resolved from the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and migrates as a single peak with an apparent Mr = 50,000-60,000. The partially purified kinase preferentially utilizes histones, Kemptide, multifunctional calmodulin-dependent protein kinase substrate peptide, ATP citrate-lyase, and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase as substrates but does not catalyze phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, casein, phosvitin, phosphorylase b, glycogen synthase, inhibitor II, and substrate peptides for casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and cGMP-dependent protein kinase. Phosphoamino acid analyses of the 32P-labeled substrates reveal that the insulin-stimulated cytosolic kinase is primarily serine-specific. The insulin-activated cytosolic kinase prefers Mn2+ to Mg2+ and is independent of Ca2+. Unlike ribosomal protein S6 kinase and protease-activated kinase II, the insulin-sensitive cytosolic kinase is fluoride-insensitive. Taken together, these results indicate that a novel cytosolic protein kinase activity is activated by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1515321682,"Acanthamoeba myosin IB contains a 125-kDa heavy chain that has high actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity when 1 serine residue is phosphorylated. The heavy chain contains two F-actin-binding sites, one associated with the catalytic site and a second which allows myosin IB to cross-link actin filaments but has no direct effect on catalytic activity. Tryptic digestion of the heavy chain initially produces an NH2-terminal 62-kDa peptide that contains the ATP-binding site and the regulatory phosphorylation site, and a COOH-terminal 68-kDa peptide. F-actin, in the absence of ATP, protects this site and tryptic cleavage then produces an NH2-terminal 80-kDa peptide. Both the 62- and the 80-kDa peptides retain the (NH+4,EDTA)-ATPase activity of native myosin IB and both bind to F-actin in an ATP-sensitive manner. However, only the 80-kDa peptide retains a major portion of the actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity. This activity requires phosphorylation of the 80-kDa peptide by myosin I heavy chain kinase but, in contrast to the activity of intact myosin IB, it has a simple, hyperbolic dependence on the concentration of F-actin. Also unlike myosin IB, the 80-kDa peptide cannot cross-link F-actin filaments indicating the presence of only a single actin-binding site. These results allow the assignment of the actin-binding site involved in catalytic activity to the region near, and possibly on both sides of, the tryptic cleavage site 62 kDa from the NH2 terminus, and the second actin-binding site to the COOH-terminal 45-kDa domain. Thus, the NH2-terminal 80 kDa of the myosin IB heavy chain is functionally similar to the 93-kDa subfragment 1 of muscle myosin and most likely has a similar organization of functional domains."
https://openalex.org/W1543827569,"The storage lipids of seeds are packaged into lipid bodies, simple organelles containing a triacylglycerol core surrounded by a layer of phospholipids and proteins. A cDNA encoding the major protein from lipid bodies of maize (L3) was used as a hybridization probe to analyze the regulation of lipid body biosynthesis during seed development and germination. Immunofluorescent microscopy demonstrates that L3 protein accumulation is tissue-specific, confined to the embryo (scutellum and embryonic axis) and the aleurone layer of developing seed. Northern analyses show that L3 mRNA also accumulates to high levels in the embryo and is not found in any nonseed tissue. The steady-state level of L3 mRNA is developmentally regulated, increasing during early seed development and peaking at about the midpoint of seed development. It then decreases slowly, to 20% of the peak level, in the embryo of the mature seed and declines rapidly to undetectable levels as the seed germinates. The high level of L3 gene expression during seed development is not due to amplification of the L3 gene, since Southern analyses of maize genomic DNA indicate that the L3 gene has the same relatively low copy number throughout development (1-4 copies/haploid) genome). Rather, the increase in the steady-state level of L3 mRNA during seed development is transcriptionally regulated. The developmental changes in L3 mRNA levels are paralleled by changes in the transcription of the L3 gene, as measured by run-off transcription in isolated nuclei. The role of the plant growth regulator abscisic acid in regulating L3 gene expression was investigated. When the mature seed is allowed to imbibe in the presence of exogenous abscisic acid, germination is retarded, and the period of L3 gene expression is extended. The extended period of L3 gene expression in the presence of exogenous abscisic acid is due, at least in part, to a dramatic and specific increase in L3 gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1495836051,"Steady state turnover of Ca2+-ATPase of sarcoplasmic reticulum has generally been reported to have a bell-shaped pH profile, with an optimum near pH 7.0. While a free [Mg2+] of 2 mM is optimal for activity at pH 7.0, it was found that this level was markedly inhibitory (K1/2 = 2 mM) at pH 8.0, thus accounting for the generally observed low activity at high pH. High activity was restored at pH 8.0 using an optimum free [Mg2+] of 0.2 mM. The mechanism of the Mg2+-dependent inhibition at pH 8.0 was probed. Inhibition was not due to Mg2+ competition with Ca2+ for cytoplasmic transport sites nor to inhibition of formation of steady state phosphoenzyme from ATP. Mg2+ inhibited (K1/2 = 1.8 mM) decay of steady state phosphoenzyme; thus, the locus of inhibition was one of the phosphoenzyme interconversion steps. Transient kinetic experiments showed that Mg2+ competitively inhibited (Ki = 0.7 mM) binding of Ca2+ to lumenal transport sites, blocking the ability of Ca2+ to reverse the catalytic cycle to form ADP-sensitive, from ADP-insensitive, phosphoenzyme. The data were consistent with a hypothesis in which Mg2+ binds lumenal Ca2+ transport sites with progressively higher affinity at higher pH to form a dead-end complex; its dissociation would then be rate-limiting during steady state turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1527768515,"Although regulatory Ca2+-binding domains of calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C (TnC) are similar, it is interesting that agents that act as CaM antagonists appear to be TnC agonists in that they sensitize cardiac myofilaments to activation by Ca2+ (El-Saleh, S., and Solaro, R. J. (1987) Biophys. J. 51, 325 (abstr.). This indicates that the effects of agents that react with Ca2+-binding proteins may depend on protein-protein interactions involved in a particular Ca2+-dependent process. In experiments described here, we have explored this idea by testing effects of calmidazolium (CDZ), a potent calmodulin antagonist on striated muscle myofilaments regulated by cardiac TnC, skeletal TnC, and CaM. CDZ was shown to increase submaximal calcium activation of myofilament force and ATPase activity in both cardiac and skeletal muscle, but the effect was greater in the case of the cardiac preparations. In the presence of 10 microM CDZ, the free Ca2+ giving half-maximal activation was reduced to about 60% of the control value in the case of cardiac myofilaments. Analogous differential effects of CDZ were also seen in studies in which we measured direct effects of CDZ on Ca2+-dependent fluorescence changes of cardiac TnC and skeletal TnC labeled with probes reporting Ca2+ binding to the regulatory sites. Measurements were also done with myofibrillar preparations of psoas muscle in which the native skeletal TnC was removed and exchanged with cardiac TnC and CaM, both of which could substitute for skeletal TnC as a regulatory protein. CDZ was more effective in sensitizing Ca2+-dependent MgATPase activity of skeletal myofibrils containing CaM than in preparations containing the native TnC. However, CDZ was most effective in its Ca2+-sensitizing effect in the case of the preparations containing cardiac TnC. Our results indicate that effects of agents that bind to Ca2+-binding proteins depend not only on the particular variant, but also on the specific environment in which the Ca2+-binding proteins operate."
https://openalex.org/W1608327340,The positions of RNA processing events mediated by RNase III and of two ribosome binding sites have been defined in an in vitro transcript of 321 nucleotides initiated at the major leftward promoter (PL) of bacteriophage lambda. Purified RNase III makes two specific endonucleolytic cleavages in the transcript at points 88 and 197 nucleotides from the PL start. The positions of these cuts suggest a secondary structure for the RNase III recognition site which is similar to other RNase III sites in which double-stranded cleavage occurs. Structure mapping experiments reveal a pattern of cleavages made in the PL transcript by nucleases specific for single- or double-stranded RNA that support the structure proposed for the RNase III stem and provide clear evidence for the stem-loop formed in the RNA at the position of the N recognition (nutL) site. Our finding that ribosomes bind efficiently in vitro to the region of the PL transcript which includes the AUG codon at position 223 supports other evidence that this triplet is the N protein start codon. The existence of an additional ribosome binding site in the N gene leader region just downstream from the nutL site identifies a second position possibly used for translational initiation or regulation. Its occurrence suggests potential roles for ribosome interaction and/or translation of the leader RNA in regulating phage development and N gene expression.
https://openalex.org/W1550951408,"The receptors for human interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) on peripheral blood monocytes and various cells of nonhematopoietic origin were thoroughly characterized and compared. The receptors of all cell types exhibited a similar affinity for IFN-gamma (Kd approximately 1 x 10(-10) M), and in all cases receptor-mediated endocytosis and ligand degradation were demonstrated. However, the receptors differed in their molecular weights (95,000 in HeLa cells and 140,000 in monocytes, assuming a 1:1 ligand to receptor ratio) as concluded from experiments of cross-linking to 125I-IFN-gamma. Lower molecular weight species were obtained as well, particularly in monocytes. Such species could represent either degradation products or subunit structures. The monocyte and HeLa receptor responded differently to an excess of ligand. A significant receptor down-regulation was observed when monocytes were incubated with an excess of 125I-IFN-gamma, whereas no such down-regulation was observed in HeLa cells or in normal fibroblasts. This differential response was observed both in the presence or in the absence of a protein synthesis inhibitor. The receptor on monocytes was found to be acid-labile whereas that on HeLa cells was resistant to acid treatment. These and additional experiments indicate that the monocyte receptor is inactivated following internalization, whereas the HeLa receptor retains its structure and recycles back to the cell surface. The difference in the properties and fate of these two receptor subtypes is probably related to the differential functions of IFN-gamma in various cell types."
https://openalex.org/W1676276085,"Abstract The mechanism of elongation of poly(ADP-ribose) on poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was examined in two ways. The first technique involved a pulse-chase protocol. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was labeled with radioactive NAD, excess precursor was removed by rapid gel filtration chromatography, and nonradioactive NAD was supplied for a second incubation. The products were released with alkali and digested with venom phosphodiesterase which generates AMP uniquely from the distal terminus. The distal residue that was labeled during the pulse remained at the distal terminus and was not converted to an internal residue during the chase. The second technique employed the NAD analog, 2'-deoxyNAD (dNAD), which can engage in mono-ADP-ribose reactions but lacks the 2'-OH that is required for polymer formation. dNAD inhibits ADP-ribose incorporation competitively but is not incorporated at the enzyme-distal chain terminus. These findings are inconsistent with a model of poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in which new residues are added to the 2'-OH terminus of the growing chain, distal to the polymerase attachment. They are consistent with the alternative possibility that new residues are added at the 1 terminus, adjacent to the polymerase. Any such proximal addition model requires that there be at least two active center sites (akin to the ribosomal A and P sites), which at a certain stage of each elongation cycle will be occupied by ADP-ribose monomers and ADP-ribose polymers, respectively. Although dNAD does not enter poly(ADP-ribose), it does engage in a slow side reaction whereby a single dADP-ribose residue is added covalently to the polymerase itself, thereby inactivating the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582990621,"Abstract The mechanism of ATP hydrolysis was studied at 0 degrees C and pH 7.5 using purified leaky vesicles of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and enzyme solubilized in monomeric form with high concentrations of octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8). The enzyme reaction of membranous Ca2+-ATPase was characterized by an initial burst in the hydrolysis of ATP and modulated by millimolar concentrations of ATP. For detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase no burst and moderate low affinity modulation was observed, but the reaction was activated both at low (phosphorylating) and intermediate (K0.5 = 0.06 mM) ATP concentrations. A study of the partial reactions indicated that the effects of detergent and ATP were attributable to activation of the E1P----E2P transition which was rate-limiting. E32P dephosphorylation of membranous Ca2+-ATPase and the detergent-solubilized monomer comprised both a slow and a rapid component. The inhibitory effect of high Ca2+ was correlated with the development of a dominant contribution of slow phase dephosphorylation and with ATP-induced extra binding of Ca2+ binding which presumably takes place at the phosphorylation site (ECaP). Ca2+ was bound with lesser affinity to detergent-solubilized Ca2+-ATPase but with qualitatively the same characteristics as to membranous ECaP. Either Ca2+ or Mg2+ was required for dephosphorylation, also after detergent solubilization. It is concluded that ATP hydrolysis occurs by the same steps for membranous and monomeric Ca2+-ATPase and involves formation of either EMgP or ECaP as reaction intermediates, leading to biphasic kinetics, which, therefore, cannot be taken as evidence of an oligomeric function of the enzyme."

In this report it is shown that a similar effect is obtained with the methylamines glycine betaine and trimethylamine N-oxide. The apparent Km value for Pi in totally aqueous medium and in the presence of either 6.4 M glycerol, 1.4 M dimethyl sulfoxide, 0.4 M trimethylamine N-oxide, or 1 M glycine betaine were found to be respectively 2.85, 0.52, 0.52, 0.81, and 0.93 mM at pH 6.2 and greater than 10.0, 1.08, 2.53, 3.05, and 2.05 mM at pH 7.5. In contrast to the effect of methylamines, urea caused an increase in the apparent Km for Pi.

Prepro alpha factor and invertase, secretory proteins from yeast, were faithfully translocated and glycosylated by Neurospora microsomes when presence cotranslationally in the Neurospora translation system. When presence cotranslationally in the Neurospora translation system, microsomes from canine pancreas(cRM) could also translocate and glycosylate the secretory proteins. However, salt-extracted cRM, which is depleted of canine signal recognition particle, could not. Furthermore, prepro alpha factor and a truncated form of invertase, containing the first 262-amino acid residues of the secretory invertase, were glycosylated by Neurospora microsomes posttranslationally, whereas only the truncated form of invertase was glycosylated by cRM when added posttranslationally. The full length invertase was not glycosylated posttranslationally. Posttranslational glycosylation of prepro alpha factor and of the truncated form of invertase is dependent on the hydrolysis of a nucleoside triphosphate. These data suggest that posttranslational glycosylation of prepro alpha factor occurs via a novel type of recognition mechanism which is either absent or ineffective in cRM."

https://openalex.org/W1491774606,"Incubation of insulin-treated rat adipocytes with chloroquine, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, was observed to inhibit the insulin-stimulated increase in insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) binding activity, whereas no significant change in IGF-II binding was observed in the absence of insulin. The incremental increase of insulin-stimulated IGF-II binding was inhibited 50% by 0.2 mM chloroquine within 15 min and was nearly completely abolished by 60 min. Interestingly, IGF-II binding was never observed to decrease below the binding value in cells without insulin treatment even when incubation was extended to 180 min. Scatchard analysis of IGF-II binding as well as the specific binding of an anti-IGF-II receptor antibody demonstrated that the loss of IGF-II binding in the insulin-stimulated chloroquine-treated adipocytes was due to a decrease in the number of cell-surface IGF-II receptors, whereas the total number of cellular IGF-II receptors was unaltered. The effect of chloroquine was observed to be reversible, temperature-dependent, and sensitive to the metabolic poison KCN. Furthermore, NH4Cl was also observed to inhibit insulin-stimulated increase in IGF-II binding. In contrast, chloroquine or NH4Cl did not inhibit the basal or insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity. Photoaffinity labeling of the glucose transporter with [3H]cytochalasin B also demonstrated that the basal and insulin-stimulated subcellular distribution of the glucose transporters was unaltered by chloroquine treatment. These results suggest that 1) insulin induces a constitutive, acidotropic agent-sensitive recycling of IGF-II receptor and 2) the glucose transporter and IGF-II receptor do not share the same insulin-regulated intracellular trafficking pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1543733435,"Unfertilized sea urchin eggs provide a reservoir of molecules which later are involved in microtubule-mediated movements during embryonic development. Among these molecules is egg dynein, which has been isolated in two forms, 20 S and 12 S. Evidence obtained previously from our laboratory indicates that 20 S dynein is a latent activity precursor of ciliary dynein. In contrast, others have suggested that 12 S egg dynein functions in the mitotic apparatus. It is therefore important to determine the relationship between these egg dyneins. Here we demonstrate that the sedimentation velocity of the egg dynein is dependent on the ionic strength of the extraction conditions. The 20 S dynein is obtained with low ionic strength extraction, and the 12 S form is obtained in high salt (0.6 M KCl). The 20 S dynein, after collection from a sucrose gradient, can be converted quantitatively to the 12 S form by exposure to salt, and this conversion can be followed over time. Further, the 20 S dynein can be converted entirely to 12 S dynein and then partially reconstituted to a faster sedimenting species. During these conversions, the dynein high Mr heavy chains are always coincident with the MgATPase activity, and antibodies show that the dynein heavy chains of the 20 S, 12 S, and converted species are indistinguishable immunologically. These data suggest that 12 S dynein is an ionic strength-dependent isoform of 20 S dynein that results from a partial dissociation of the 20 S polypeptide complex, similar to the relationship between 12 and 21 S sperm flagellar dynein. If the 20 and 12 S enzymes are isoforms of the same dynein, then there is compelling evidence for only a single dynein in the unfertilized egg, and that dynein is probably a ciliary precursor."
https://openalex.org/W1512802973,"The fine specificity of the T cell repertoire directed against T helper (Th)-inducing and T suppressor (Ts)-inducing determinants was examined with cyanogen bromide and tryptic peptides of Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (GZ), a large tetrameric protein (monomer molecular weight = 116 kDa). Immunization with cyanogen bromide fragment 2 [CB-2, amino acids (a.a.) 3-92] induced both specific Th and Ts cells. Study of the induction of these functionally opposite T cell subpopulations with tryptic peptides of CB-2 indicated that Th and Ts were activated by separate, nonoverlapping determinants. Th-inducing activity resided in a nonapeptide, T6 (a.a. 44-52), whereas T4 (a.a. 27-37) induced Ts cells. The presence of distinct helper and suppressor determinants suggests that the specificity repertoire in these T cell subpopulations may differ, perhaps owing to the expression of antigen-recognizing receptors that are coded by unique gene families. Alternatively, antigen presentation structures may be physicochemically quite different, and bind to distinct parts of the peptide antigen."
https://openalex.org/W1547186519,"Abstract The roe of striped mullet (Mugil cephalus) was found to contain a beta-hexosaminidase different from the beta-hexosaminidases isolated from other sources. The enzyme from mullet roe is able to cleave GalNAc from GM2 without the assistance of either an activator protein or a detergent. It also cleaves the oligosaccharide derived from GM2 and other oligosaccharides containing the GM2 sequence GalNAc beta 4(NeuAc alpha 3)Gal-. However, it is not effective in hydrolyzing neutral glycosphingolipids containing terminal GalNAc or GlcNAc, such as GbOse4Cer, GgOse3Cer, or LcOse3Cer. These results indicate that mullet roe beta-hexosaminidase can specifically cleave GalNAc from the glycoconjugates containing the GM2 sequence. No beta-hexosaminidase with such specificity has been previously described. Thus, this unique enzyme should be very useful for the detection and analysis of glycoconjugates containing the oligosaccharide chains with GM2 sequence."
