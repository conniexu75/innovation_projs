https://openalex.org/W2572710398,"Reactive astrocytes are strongly induced by central nervous system (CNS) injury and disease, but their role is poorly understood. Here we show that a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which we termed A1, is induced by classically activated neuroinflammatory microglia. We show that activated microglia induce A1 astrocytes by secreting Il-1α, TNF and C1q, and that these cytokines together are necessary and sufficient to induce A1 astrocytes. A1 astrocytes lose the ability to promote neuronal survival, outgrowth, synaptogenesis and phagocytosis, and induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Death of axotomized CNS neurons in vivo is prevented when the formation of A1 astrocytes is blocked. Finally, we show that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s and Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Taken together these findings help to explain why CNS neurons die after axotomy, strongly suggest that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes in neurodegenerative disorders, and provide opportunities for the development of new treatments for these diseases. A reactive astrocyte subtype termed A1 is induced after injury or disease of the central nervous system and subsequently promotes the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes. Different types of reactive astrocyte are generated after various injuries and insults to the brain, but less is known about what these astrocyte subtypes do. Here, Shane Liddelow et al. describe how these reactive astrocytes are induced by neuroinflammatory microglia. The authors also explore the functional roles of reactive astrocytes in the progression of disease or damaged states, and show that A1 astrocytes contribute to the death of neurons in the central nervous system under certain conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2579294549,"Temperate viruses can become dormant in their host cells, a process called lysogeny. In every infection, such viruses decide between the lytic and the lysogenic cycles, that is, whether to replicate and lyse their host or to lysogenize and keep the host viable. Here we show that viruses (phages) of the SPbeta group use a small-molecule communication system to coordinate lysis-lysogeny decisions. During infection of its Bacillus host cell, the phage produces a six amino-acids-long communication peptide that is released into the medium. In subsequent infections, progeny phages measure the concentration of this peptide and lysogenize if the concentration is sufficiently high. We found that different phages encode different versions of the communication peptide, demonstrating a phage-specific peptide communication code for lysogeny decisions. We term this communication system the 'arbitrium' system, and further show that it is encoded by three phage genes: aimP, which produces the peptide; aimR, the intracellular peptide receptor; and aimX, a negative regulator of lysogeny. The arbitrium system enables a descendant phage to 'communicate' with its predecessors, that is, to estimate the amount of recent previous infections and hence decide whether to employ the lytic or lysogenic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2522893942,"Finding a conceptually new way to control the magnetic state of media with the lowest possible production of heat and simultaneously at the fastest possible time-scale is a new challenge in fundamental magnetism [1-4] as well as an increasingly important issue in modern information technology [5]. Recent results demonstrate that exclusively in metals it is possible to switch magnetization between metastable states by femtosecond circularly polarized laser pulses [6-8]. However, despite the record breaking speed of the switching, the mechanisms in these materials are directly related to strong optical absorption and laser-induced heating close to the Curie temperature [9-12]. Here we report about ultrafast all-optical photo-magnetic recording in transparent dielectrics. In ferrimagnetic garnet film a single linearly polarized femtosecond laser pulse breaks the degeneracy between metastable magnetic states and promotes switching of spins between them. Changing the polarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net magnetization in the garnet, write ""0"" and ""1"" magnetic bits at will. This mechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read magnetic recording event (< 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load (< 6 J/cm3)."
https://openalex.org/W2576681512,"The genome of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) frequently contains deletions of tumour suppressor gene loci, most notably SMAD4, which is homozygously deleted in nearly one-third of cases. As loss of neighbouring housekeeping genes can confer collateral lethality, we sought to determine whether loss of the metabolic gene malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in the SMAD4 locus would create cancer-specific metabolic vulnerability upon targeting of its paralogous isoform ME3. The mitochondrial malic enzymes (ME2 and ME3) are oxidative decarboxylases that catalyse the conversion of malate to pyruvate and are essential for NADPH regeneration and reactive oxygen species homeostasis. Here we show that ME3 depletion selectively kills ME2-null PDAC cells in a manner consistent with an essential function for ME3 in ME2-null cancer cells. Mechanistically, integrated metabolomic and molecular investigation of cells deficient in mitochondrial malic enzymes revealed diminished NADPH production and consequent high levels of reactive oxygen species. These changes activate AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn directly suppresses sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1)-directed transcription of its direct targets including the BCAT2 branched-chain amino acid transaminase 2) gene. BCAT2 catalyses the transfer of the amino group from branched-chain amino acids to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) thereby regenerating glutamate, which functions in part to support de novo nucleotide synthesis. Thus, mitochondrial malic enzyme deficiency, which results in impaired NADPH production, provides a prime 'collateral lethality' therapeutic strategy for the treatment of a substantial fraction of patients diagnosed with this intractable disease."
https://openalex.org/W2577758672,"Stem cell fate has been linked to the mechanical properties of their underlying substrate, affecting mechanoreceptors and ultimately leading to downstream biological response. Studies have used polymers to mimic the stiffness of extracellular matrix as well as of individual tissues and shown mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) could be directed along specific lineages. In this study, we examined the role of stiffness in MSC differentiation to two closely related cell phenotypes: osteoblast and chondrocyte. We prepared four methyl acrylate/methyl methacrylate (MA/MMA) polymer surfaces with elastic moduli ranging from 0.1 MPa to 310 MPa by altering monomer concentration. MSCs were cultured in media without exogenous growth factors and their biological responses were compared to committed chondrocytes and osteoblasts. Both chondrogenic and osteogenic markers were elevated when MSCs were grown on substrates with stiffness <10 MPa. Like chondrocytes, MSCs on lower stiffness substrates showed elevated expression of ACAN, SOX9, and COL2 and proteoglycan content; COMP was elevated in MSCs but reduced in chondrocytes. Substrate stiffness altered levels of RUNX2 mRNA, alkaline phosphatase specific activity, osteocalcin, and osteoprotegerin in osteoblasts, decreasing levels on the least stiff substrate. Expression of integrin subunits α1, α2, α5, αv, β1, and β3 changed in a stiffness- and cell type-dependent manner. Silencing of integrin subunit beta 1 (ITGB1) in MSCs abolished both osteoblastic and chondrogenic differentiation in response to substrate stiffness. Our results suggest that substrate stiffness is an important mediator of osteoblastic and chondrogenic differentiation, and integrin β1 plays a pivotal role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2575435751,"Background In Australia, there is limited evidence on the impact of antenatal depression on perinatal outcomes. This study investigates the association between maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy and key perinatal outcomes, including birth weight, gestational age at birth, breastfeeding indicators and postnatal depressive symptoms. Method A retrospective cohort of mothers (N = 17,564) of all infants born in public health facilities within South Western Sydney Local Health District and Sydney Local Health District in 2014, in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, was enumerated from routinely collected antenatal data to investigate the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Antenatal depressive symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Logistic regression models that adjusted for confounders were conducted to determine associations between antenatal depressive symptoms and low birth weight, early gestational age at birth (<37 weeks), breast feeding indicators and postnatal depressive symptoms. Results The prevalence of maternal depressive symptoms during pregnancy was 7.0% in the cohort, and was significantly associated with postnatal depressive symptoms [Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 6.4, 95% CI: 4.8–8.7, P<0.001]. Antenatal depressive symptoms was associated with a higher odds of low birth weight [AOR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2–2.3, P = 0.003] and a gestational age at birth of <37 weeks [AOR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1–1.7, P = 0.018] compared to women who reported lower EPDS scores in antenatal period. Antenatal depressive symptoms were not strongly associated with non-exclusive breast feeding in the early postnatal period. Conclusion Maternal depressive symptoms in the antenatal period are strongly associated with postnatal depressive symptoms and adverse perinatal outcomes in Australian infants. Early identification of antenatal and postnatal depressive symptoms, and referral for appropriate management could benefit not only the mother’s mental health, but also the infant’s health and development."
https://openalex.org/W2572480523,"Cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels are essential for vision and olfaction. They belong to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily but their activities are controlled by intracellular cyclic nucleotides instead of transmembrane voltage. Here we report a 3.5-Å-resolution single-particle electron cryo-microscopy structure of a cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel from Caenorhabditis elegans in the cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-bound open state. The channel has an unusual voltage-sensor-like domain, accounting for its deficient voltage dependence. A carboxy-terminal linker connecting S6 and the cyclic-nucleotide-binding domain interacts directly with both the voltage-sensor-like domain and the pore domain, forming a gating ring that couples conformational changes triggered by cyclic nucleotide binding to the gate. The selectivity filter is lined by the carboxylate side chains of a functionally important glutamate and three rings of backbone carbonyls. This structure provides a new framework for understanding mechanisms of ion permeation, gating and channelopathy of cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels and cyclic nucleotide modulation of related channels."
https://openalex.org/W2577159120,"The structural maintenance of chromosome 5/6 complex (Smc5/6) is a restriction factor that represses hepatitis B virus (HBV) transcription. HBV counters this restriction by expressing HBV X protein (HBx), which targets Smc5/6 for degradation. However, the mechanism by which Smc5/6 suppresses HBV transcription and how HBx is initially expressed is not known. In this study we characterized viral kinetics and the host response during HBV infection of primary human hepatocytes (PHH) to address these unresolved questions. We determined that Smc5/6 localizes with Nuclear Domain 10 (ND10) in PHH. Co-localization has functional implications since depletion of ND10 structural components alters the nuclear distribution of Smc6 and induces HBV gene expression in the absence of HBx. We also found that HBV infection and replication does not induce a prominent global host transcriptional response in PHH, either shortly after infection when Smc5/6 is present, or at later times post-infection when Smc5/6 has been degraded. Notably, HBV and an HBx-negative virus establish high level infection in PHH without inducing expression of interferon-stimulated genes or production of interferons or other cytokines. Our study also revealed that Smc5/6 is degraded in the majority of infected PHH by the time cccDNA transcription could be detected and that HBx RNA is present in cell culture-derived virus preparations as well as HBV patient plasma. Collectively, these data indicate that Smc5/6 is an intrinsic antiviral restriction factor that suppresses HBV transcription when localized to ND10 without inducing a detectable innate immune response. Our data also suggest that HBx protein may be initially expressed by delivery of extracellular HBx RNA into HBV-infected cells."
https://openalex.org/W2574709330,"The Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) is witnessing an increase in chronic disorders, including mental illness. With ongoing unrest, this is expected to rise. This is the first study to quantify the burden of mental disorders in the EMR. We used data from the Global Burden of Disease study (GBD) 2013. DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) allow assessment of both premature mortality (years of life lost-YLLs) and nonfatal outcomes (years lived with disability-YLDs). DALYs are computed by adding YLLs and YLDs for each age-sex-country group. In 2013, mental disorders contributed to 5.6% of the total disease burden in the EMR (1894 DALYS/100,000 population): 2519 DALYS/100,000 (2590/100,000 males, 2426/100,000 females) in high-income countries, 1884 DALYS/100,000 (1618/100,000 males, 2157/100,000 females) in middle-income countries, 1607 DALYS/100,000 (1500/100,000 males, 1717/100,000 females) in low-income countries. Females had a greater proportion of burden due to mental disorders than did males of equivalent ages, except for those under 15 years of age. The highest proportion of DALYs occurred in the 25-49 age group, with a peak in the 35-39 years age group (5344 DALYs/100,000). The burden of mental disorders in EMR increased from 1726 DALYs/100,000 in 1990 to 1912 DALYs/100,000 in 2013 (10.8% increase). Within the mental disorders group in EMR, depressive disorders accounted for most DALYs, followed by anxiety disorders. Among EMR countries, Palestine had the largest burden of mental disorders. Nearly all EMR countries had a higher mental disorder burden compared to the global level. Our findings call for EMR ministries of health to increase provision of mental health services and to address the stigma of mental illness. Moreover, our results showing the accelerating burden of mental health are alarming as the region is seeing an increased level of instability. Indeed, mental health problems, if not properly addressed, will lead to an increased burden of diseases in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2576526246,"Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine: it mediates responses to pathogens or tissue damage, and drives autoimmune diseases. Little is known about its role in the nervous system. Here we show that IL-17 has neuromodulator-like properties in Caenorhabditis elegans. IL-17 can act directly on neurons to alter their response properties and contribution to behaviour. Using unbiased genetic screens, we delineate an IL-17 signalling pathway and show that it acts in the RMG hub interneurons. Disrupting IL-17 signalling reduces RMG responsiveness to input from oxygen sensors, and renders sustained escape from 21% oxygen transient and contingent on additional stimuli. Over-activating IL-17 receptors abnormally heightens responses to 21% oxygen in RMG neurons and whole animals. IL-17 deficiency can be bypassed by optogenetic stimulation of RMG. Inducing IL-17 expression in adults can rescue mutant defects within 6 h. These findings reveal a non-immunological role of IL-17 modulating circuit function and behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2576507749,"This study aimed to describe the prevalence and risk factors of prehypertension and hypertension in Jiangxi Province, China. Individuals with prehypertension frequently progress into hypertension and are at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease and stroke.A cross-sectional survey of 15,296 participants (15 years or older) was conducted in Jiangxi Province, China, in 2013, using questionnaire forms and physical measurements.The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension was 32.3% (39.2% in men and 27.6% in women) and 29.0% (30.1% in men and 28.2% in women), respectively. The awareness, treatment, and control rates among all hypertensive participants were 64.8%, 27.1%, and 12.6%, respectively. The prevalence of prehypertension in males declined with age, but the prevalence of hypertension increased in different genders. The prevalence of prehypertension and hypertension increased with increasing body mass index (BMI). The prevalence of prehypertension decreased, in parallel to an increase in the prevalence of hypertension, with increasing waist circumference (WC). A combination of WC and BMI was superior to individual indices in identifying hypertension. A multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that increasing age, high BMI, high visceral adipose index, and high heart rate were risk factors for prehypertension and hypertension. The high body fat percentage was significantly associated with prehypertension. Living in an urban area, male sex, abdominal obesity, and menopause were correlated with hypertension.Prehypertension and hypertension are epidemic in southern China. Further studies are needed to explore an indicator that can represent the visceral fat accurately and has a close relationship with cardiovascular disease."
https://openalex.org/W2572079237,"Recent evidence suggests involvement of biometal homeostasis in the pathological mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). For example, increased intracellular copper or zinc has been linked to a reduction in secreted levels of the AD-causing amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). However, little is known about whether these biometals modulate the generation of Aβ. In the present study we demonstrate in both cell-free and cell-based assays that zinc and copper regulate Aβ production by distinct molecular mechanisms affecting the processing by γ-secretase of its Aβ precursor protein substrate APP-C99. We found that Zn2+ induces APP-C99 dimerization, which prevents its cleavage by γ-secretase and Aβ production, with an IC50 value of 15 μm. Importantly, at this concentration, Zn2+ also drastically raised the production of the aggregation-prone Aβ43 found in the senile plaques of AD brains and elevated the Aβ43:Aβ40 ratio, a promising biomarker for neurotoxicity and AD. We further demonstrate that the APP-C99 histidine residues His-6, His-13, and His-14 control the Zn2+-dependent APP-C99 dimerization and inhibition of Aβ production, whereas the increased Aβ43:Aβ40 ratio is substrate dimerization-independent and involves the known Zn2+ binding lysine Lys-28 residue that orientates the APP-C99 transmembrane domain within the lipid bilayer. Unlike zinc, copper inhibited Aβ production by directly targeting the subunits presenilin and nicastrin in the γ-secretase complex. Altogether, our data demonstrate that zinc and copper differentially modulate Aβ production. They further suggest that dimerization of APP-C99 or the specific targeting of individual residues regulating the production of the long, toxic Aβ species, may offer two therapeutic strategies for preventing AD.

https://openalex.org/W2577931572,"To study the regulation of colorectal adenocarcinoma progression by O-GlcNAc, we have focused on the O-GlcNAc-mediated epigenetic regulation of human colon cancer stem cells (CCSC). Xenograft tumors from colon tumor cells with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase (OGT) knockdown grew significantly slower than those formed from control cells, indicating a reduced proliferation of tumor cells due to inhibition of OGT expression. Significant reduction of the CCSC population was observed in the tumor cells after OGT knockdown, whereas tumor cells treated with the O-GlcNAcase inhibitor showed an increased CCSC population, indicating that O-GlcNAc levels regulated the CCSC compartment. When grown in suspension, tumor cells with OGT knockdown showed a reduced ability to form tumorspheres, indicating a reduced self-renewal of CCSC due to reduced levels of O-GlcNAc. ChIP-sequencing experiments using an anti-O-GlcNAc antibody revealed significant chromatin enrichment of O-GlcNAc-modified proteins at the promoter of the transcription factor MYBL1, which was also characterized by the presence of H3K27me3. RNA-sequencing analysis showed an increased expression of MYBL1 in tumor cells with OGT knockdown. Forced overexpression of MYBL1 led to a reduced population of CCSC and tumor growth in vivo, similar to the effects of OGT silencing. Moreover, two CpG islands near the transcription start site of MYBL1 were identified, and O-GlcNAc levels regulated their methylation status. These results strongly argue that O-GlcNAc epigenetically regulates MYBL1, functioning similarly to H3K27me3. The aberrant CCSC compartment observed after modulating O-GlcNAc levels is therefore likely to result, at least in part, from the epigenetic regulation of MYBL1 expression by O-GlcNAc, thereby significantly affecting tumor progression."
https://openalex.org/W2573569988,"Host genotype can influence the composition of the commensal bacterial community in some organisms. Composition, however, is only one parameter describing a microbial community. Here, we test whether a second parameter-abundance of bacteria-is a heritable trait by quantifying the presence of four commensal bacterial strains within 36 gnotobiotic inbred lines of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that D. melanogaster genotype exerts a significant effect on microbial levels within the fly. When introduced as monocultures into axenic flies, three of the four bacterial strains were reliably detected within the fly. The amounts of these different strains are strongly correlated, suggesting that the host regulates commensal bacteria through general, not bacteria-specific, means. While the correlation does not appear to be driven by simple variation in overall gut dimensions, a genetic association study suggests that variation in commensal bacterial load may largely be attributed to physical aspects of host cell growth and development."
https://openalex.org/W2579882411,"The DNA-binding One Zinc Finger (Dof) genes are ubiquitous in many plant species and are especial transcription regulators that participate in plant growth, development and various procedures, including biotic and abiotic stress reactions. In this study, we identified 41 PtrDof members from Populus trichocarpa genomes and classified them into four groups. The conserved motifs and gene structures of some PtrDof genes belonging to the same subgroup were almost the same. The 41 PtrDof genes were dispersed on 18 of the 19 Populus chromosomes. Many key stress- or phytohormone-related cis-elements were discovered in the PtrDof gene promoter regions. Consequently, we undertook expression profiling of the PtrDof genes in leaves and roots in response to osmotic stress and abscisic acid. A total of seven genes (PtrDof14, 16, 25, 27, 28, 37 and 39) in the Populus Dof gene family were consistently upregulated at point in all time in the leaves and roots under osmotic and abscisic acid (ABA) stress. We observed that 12 PtrDof genes could be targeted by 15 miRNAs. Moreover, we mapped the cleavage site in PtrDof30 using the 5’RLM-RACE. The results showed that PtrDofs may have a role in resistance to abiotic stress in Populus trichocarpa."
https://openalex.org/W2576275886,"Experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) is a CD4+ T-cell-mediated autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system. It has been replicated in an animal model of human inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of a selective inhibitor of the immunoproteasome subunit, low-MW polypeptide 7 (PR-957) in rats with EAN. Our results showed that PR-957 significantly delayed onset day, reduced severity and shortened duration of EAN, and alleviated demyelination and inflammatory infiltration in sciatic nerves. In addition to significantly regulating expression of the cytokine profile, PR-957 treatment down-regulated the proportion of proinflammatory T-helper (Th)17 cells in sciatic nerves and spleens of rats with EAN. Data presented show the role of PR-957 in the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathway. PR-957 not only decreased expression of IL-6 and IL-23 but also led to down-regulation of STAT3 phosphorylation in CD4+ T cells. Regulation of the STAT3 pathway led to a reduction in retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor γ t and IL-17 production. Furthermore, reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation may have directly suppressed Th17-cell differentiation. Therefore, our study demonstrates that PR-957 could potently alleviate inflammation in rats with EAN and that it may be a likely candidate for treating Guillain-Barré syndrome.-Liu, H., Wan, C., Ding, Y., Han, R., He, Y., Xiao, J., Hao, J.

https://openalex.org/W2572498644,"Traditionally, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are thought to be located on the cell surface where they transmit extracellular signals to the cytoplasm. However, recent studies indicate that some GPCRs are also localized to various subcellular compartments such as the nucleus where they appear required for various biological functions. For example, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is concentrated at the inner nuclear membrane (INM) where it mediates Ca2+ changes in the nucleoplasm by coupling with Gq/11. Here, we identified a region within the C-terminal domain (amino acids 852–876) that is necessary and sufficient for INM localization of the receptor. Because these sequences do not correspond to known nuclear localization signal motifs, they represent a new motif for INM trafficking. mGluR5 is also trafficked to the plasma membrane where it undergoes re-cycling/degradation in a separate receptor pool, one that does not interact with the nuclear mGluR5 pool. Finally, our data suggest that once at the INM, mGluR5 is stably retained via interactions with chromatin. Thus, mGluR5 is perfectly positioned to regulate nucleoplasmic Ca2+ in situ.

G-protein-coupled receptor inner nuclear membrane endoplasmic reticulum nuclear exclusion signal nuclear localization signal inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate outer nuclear membrane lamin B receptor plasma membrane nuclear membrane endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H region of interest (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine peptide:N-glycosidase 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 l-quisqualic acid LY53, LY393053 bungarotoxin-binding site 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) fluorescence recovery after photobleaching red fluorescent protein. As many GPCRs are on or in the nucleus, the question arises as to how they get there. Various possibilities exist to transfer membrane proteins from the outer to the inner nuclear membrane (ONM and INM), including vesicle fusion, membrane rupture, and channel-mediated pathways. Most prominently, a diffusion-retention model has been proposed for many INM proteins (e.g. lamin B receptor (LBR)) (20.Zuleger N. Kerr A.R. Schirmer E.C.

Jaspersen S.L. Destination: inner nuclear membrane.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 221-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This model suggests that proteins synthesized in the ER rapidly diffuse laterally in the ONM, pass through peripheral channels existing between the nuclear pore complex and the pore membrane, and then become tethered in the INM via nucleoplasmic interactions with nuclear lamins or chromatin (22.Lusk C.P.

Although the exact signals are unknown, at least 15 proteins have been shown to translocate through peripheral channels to reside on the INM (20.Zuleger N. Kerr A.R. Schirmer E.C.

Current findings show that a wide range of mechanisms underlie transmembrane INM transport, including use of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motifs, use of nucleoporins, and use of the peripheral channels or the central channel or both (20.Zuleger N.

Destination: inner nuclear membrane.Trends Cell Biol. 2014; 24: 221-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Certain INM proteins also contain an NLS, although mutation or deletion does not affect INM localization (20.Zuleger N. Kerr A.R. Schirmer E.C. Many mechanisms, one entrance: membrane protein translocation into the nucleus.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2012; 69: 2205-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Many peptide-activated GPCRs also use an NLS and karyopherins such as importin-β1 for nuclear import after receptor activation on the cell surface (16.Joyal J.S. Nim S. Zhu T. Sitaras N. Rivera J.C. Shao Z. Sapieha P. Hamel D. Sanchez M. Zaniolo K. St-Louis M. Ouellette J. Montoya-Zavala M. Zabeida A. Picard E. et al.Subcellular localization of coagulation factor II receptor-like 1 in neurons governs angiogenesis.Nat. Med. 2014; 20: 1165-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as these receptors are not associated with the INM but rather appear within the nucleoplasm itself (via unknown mechanisms), the nucleoplasm targeting motifs might be quite different. Thus, unlike karyopherin-mediated transport of soluble proteins, targeting proteins to the INM is more varied and complex. One intracellular GPCR found on the INM is the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). mGluR5 plays a key role in normal neurodevelopment as well as in many neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders such as Fragile X syndrome/Autism Spectrum Disorders, anxiety, schizophrenia, drug addiction, Parkinson's disease, dyskinesias, and chronic pain (1.Jong Y.J.

Although mGluR5 is found on the plasma membrane, 60–90% of the receptor is associated with intracellular membranes like the INM (29.Hubert G.W. Paquet M. Smith Y.

Pharmacological isolation and genetic manipulation have allowed us to determine that INM mGluR5 couples to Gq/11 leading to a large sustained release of luminal Ca2+, phosphorylation of nuclear Erk1/2, and activation of immediate early genes such as Elk-1, Fos, Fosl1, and FosL2, and immediate early effector proteins such as Arc (34.Kumar V.

Physiologically, intracellular mGluR5 contributes to long term depression in the hippocampus (19.Purgert C.A. Izumi Y. Jong Y.J. Kumar V. Zorumski C.F. O'Malley K.L. Intracellular mGluR5 can mediate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.J.

Commun. 2016; 7: 10604Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To further dissect mGluR5's subcellular functions, defining the sequence motifs responsible for its localization is necessary. Using molecular, immunological, and optical techniques, here we show that 25 amino acids within the mGluR5 nucleoplasmic domain are necessary and sufficient for its localization to the INM. Moreover, mGluR5 appears to be tethered in place via interactions with chromatin. Thus, mGluR5 appears to use a non-canonical signal sequence-retention strategy to anchor itself on the INM where it is poised to regulate transcription (35.Kumar V. Fahey P.G. Jong Y.J. Ramanan N.

To date, no motifs responsible for maintaining mGluR5 or other INM GPCRs in this location have been described. Because trafficking of GPCRs is often dictated by sequences within the cytoplasmic tail (37.Walther C. Ferguson S.S.

Regulated GPCR trafficking to the plasma membrane: general issues and the CCR5 chemokine receptor example.Subcell. Biochem. 2012; 63: 97-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the mGluR5 C terminus is the domain required for INM localization. To test this idea, we prepared HA-tagged chimeric constructs derived from mGluR5 and the closely related GABAB2 GPCR. Typically, GABAB2 receptors form heterodimers with GABAB1, masking an ER retention signal (42.Margeta-Mitrovic M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. A trafficking checkpoint controls GABA(B) receptor heterodimerization.Neuron. 2000; 27: 97-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar), following which the heterodimer is efficiently transported to the PM (43.White J.H. Wise A. Main M.J. Green A. Fraser N.J. Disney G.H. Barnes A.A. Emson P. Foord S.M. Marshall F.H. Heterodimerization is required for the formation of a functional GABA(B) receptor.Nature. 1998; 396: 679-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Because GABAB2 always traffics to the PM, it serves as a control for PM localization. Thus, chimeric plasmids were created in which the C termini of mGluR5 and GABAB2 were swapped (Fig. 1A). For this experiment and others described below, HA-tagged control and chimeric receptors were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells and subsequently stained for PM expression using antibodies directed against HA on non-permeabilized cells. All constructs showed at least some level of PM expression, although absolute amounts varied as indicated by the line scans and western blots associated with FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2 (and data not shown). Because the HA tag is in the extracellular ligand binding domain, these results suggest that introduced receptors assume the correct orientation within the PM and that regardless of the described manipulation, the receptor could be found on the PM. Immunocytochemical analyses of permeabilized cells revealed that the chimeric receptor, NmG5CGB2, was found predominately at the cell surface whereas NGB2CmG5 was on NM and ER membranes. In particular, NGB2CmG5 co-localized with the NM marker lamin B2 whereas NmG5CGB2 did not (Fig. 1A). Line scan analysis corroborated that mGluR5 and NGB2CmG5 co-localized with lamin B2 on NM (Fig. 1, A–C). We also assessed the intensity of fluorescent signals detected on either the PM or NM across multiple experiments. These results confirmed that the C terminus of mGluR5 prevented the chimeric NGB2CmG5 from going to the cell surface, and in contrast, the GABAB2 C terminus predominantly localized mGluR5 lacking its C terminus at the PM (Fig. 1, A and D). To confirm and extend these results, we used subcellular fractionation. Following transient transfection, mGluR5 was readily visible in NM fractions (Fig. 2A), whereas GABAB2 was not (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the immunocytochemistry, the NmG5CGB2 construct was primarily detected in the PM fraction (Fig. 2C); whereas NGB2CmG5 was detected in both PM and nuclear fractions (Fig. 2D). Quantitation of results from multiple experiments is shown in Fig. 2E. Treatment with 1 mm glutamate or baclofen (mGluR5 and GABAB2 agonists, respectively) did not produce an obvious re-distribution of receptor subtypes in these cultures (Fig. 11B, and not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the C terminus is necessary and sufficient for NM localization of mGluR5. To further define regions critical for NM localization, we prepared three different constructs to examine the involvement of the proximal regions of the mGluR5 C terminus for NM localization. Because the size of the C-terminal region available to go through the nuclear pore might influence its ability to do so (22.Lusk C.P. Blobel G. King M.C. Highway to the inner nuclear membrane: rules for the road.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), additional constructs were deliberately kept within the size range of the original mGluR5 C terminus. Thus, constructs were similar to the NmG5CGB2 construct but carried small C-terminal extensions downstream of the seventh transmembrane domain of mGluR5 before the addition of the GABAB2 C terminus (Fig. 3A). Distribution and orientation of the constructs NmG5_854CGB2, NmG5_896CGB2, and NmG5_966CGB2 were examined by immunostaining and subcellular fractionation methods (Fig. 3, A–G). Lamin B2 co-localization was observed for the NmG5_896CGB2 and NmG5_966CGB2 constructs in HEK293 cells; however, NmG5_854CGB2 was primarily localized on the PM (Fig. 3, A–C). This distribution pattern was further confirmed by subcellular fractionation (Fig. 3, D–G). Occasionally, doublet bands were seen in some PM and NM fractions, which presumably reflect the glycosylation state of the receptor at the time of processing. This interpretation is consistent with results below (Fig. 11A), in which similar doublets were seen prior to PNGase F treatment but not afterward. These results suggest that mGluR5 amino acids 855–896 are required for NM localization. To further define which amino acids were responsible for nuclear targeting, we separately deleted amino acids 852–876 (Δ852–876) and amino acids 877–896 (Δ877–896) from the HA-tagged full-length mGluR5 plasmid (Fig. 4, A and B). HA immunostaining indicated that the Δ852–876 construct was largely in the ER, whereas Δ877–896 still showed strong co-localization with lamin B2 (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, these results suggest that amino acids 852–876 contain the minimal region for NM localization. To determine whether these sequences were sufficient to target the nucleus on their own, we created a construct with an N-terminal Kozak sequence followed by mGluR5 amino acids 827–992, an HA epitope, and then a stop codon. Because there are no transmembrane domains in this construct, it would not be associated with any membrane. However, if nuclear localization signals are found within this stretch of amino acids, then presumably karyopherins will recognize these motifs and promote the transport of the receptor fragment into the nucleoplasm. We also created new constructs, including the Δ852–876 deletion as well as the Δ877–896 deletion in the mG5(827–992) backbone (Fig. 4C). As shown in Fig. 4, C and D, HA staining is only observed within the nucleus for constructs containing amino acids 852–876. In contrast, the construct missing those amino acids is largely found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, C and D). Therefore, these sequences contain sufficient information to be translocated into the nucleus. To confirm and extend these results in a more physiological environment, we tested the localization of constructs in dissociated striatal neurons that endogenously express mGluR5. Thus, rat striatal neurons were transfected with the chimeric constructs, proximal mGluR5 constructs, or deletion constructs (mGluR5, GABAB2, NmG5CGB2, NGB2CmG5, NmG5_854CGB2, NmG5_896CGB2, Δ852–876, and Δ877–896), subsequently immunostained, and then assessed for localization (Fig. 5, A and B). Lamin B2 co-localization was observed for the NGB2CmG5, NmG5_896CGB2, and Δ877–896 constructs, similar to what was observed in HEK293 cells. These data are consistent with mGluR5 requiring amino acids 852–876 for NM localization. To determine whether more distal mGluR5 C-terminal sequences also played a role in NM localization, we prepared additional constructs consisting of the entire GABAB2 receptor fused with distal mGluR5 C-terminal stretches (NGB2CmG5_827–966, NGB2CmG5_967–1036, NGB2CmG5_967–1106, and NGB2CmG5_1107–1171). This strategy kept the total length of the chimeric C terminus a"

Here, we test the hypothesis that otherwise neurotoxic glutamate can be productively metabolized by glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) to maintain cellular energetics and protect the brain from ischemic stroke injury. The GOT-dependent metabolism of glutamate was studied in primary neural cells and in stroke-affected C57-BL6 mice using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and GC-MS. Extracellular Glu sustained cell viability under hypoglycemic conditions and increased GOT-mediated metabolism in vitro Correction of stroke-induced hypoxia using supplemental oxygen in vivo lowered Glu levels as measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy. GOT knockdown abrogated this effect and caused ATP loss in the stroke-affected brain. GOT overexpression increased anaplerotic refilling of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates in mouse brain during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, GOT overexpression not only reduced ischemic stroke lesion volume but also attenuated neurodegeneration and improved poststroke sensorimotor function. Taken together, our results support a new paradigm that GOT enables metabolism of otherwise neurotoxic extracellular Glu through a truncated tricarboxylic acid cycle under hypoglycemic conditions.-Rink, C., Gnyawali, S., Stewart, R., Teplitsky, S., Harris, H., Roy, S., Sen, C.

Starvation provides insights in physiological processes without interference from unknown factors in digestion and nutrient absorption occurring in fed state. Juveniles of amberjack Seriola lalandi were isotopically equilibrated to a formulated diet for 60 days. One treatment consisted of fish that continued to be fed and fish in the other treatment were not fed for 35 days. The isotopic signatures prior to the beginning of and after the starvation period, for fish in the starvation and control treatments, were analysed for lipid content, fatty acid composition and isotopic analysis of bulk (EA-IRMS) and of amino acids (compound specific isotope analysis, CSIA). There were three replicates for the starvation group. Fatty acid content in muscle and liver tissue before and after starvation was determined to calculate percent change. Results showed that crude lipid was the most used source of energy in most cases; the PUFAs and LC-PUFAs were highly conserved. According to the protein signature in bulk (δ15N) and per amino acid (δ13C and δ15N), in muscle tissue, protein synthesis did not appear to occur substantially during starvation, whereas in liver, increases in δ13C and δ15N indicate that protein turnover occurred, probably for metabolic routing to energy-yielding processes. As a result, isotopic values of δ15N in muscle tissue do not change, whereas CSIA net change occurred in the liver tissue.

The chimeric character is not stable during the in vitro tissue culturing. Many regenerated plants lost economic values for the loss of the chimeric character of leaves. In order to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in the albino phenotype of the leaf cells, the physiological and transcriptional differences between complete white (CWh) and green (CGr) leaf cells of A. comosus var. bracteatus were analyzed. A total of 1,431 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) in CGr and CWh leaves were identified using RNA-seq. A comparison to the COG, GO and KEGG annotations revealed DEGs involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, chloroplast development and photosynthesis. Furthermore, the measurement of main precursors of chlorophyll in the CWh leaves confirmed that the rate-limiting step in chlorophyll biosynthesis, and thus the cause of the albino phenotype of the white cells, was the conversion of pyrrole porphobilinogen (PBG) to uroporphyrinogen III (Uro III). The enzyme activity of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) and uroporporphyrinogn III synthase (UROS), which catalyze the transition of PBG to Uro III, was significantly decreased in the CWh leaves. Our data showed the transcriptional differences between the CWh and CGr plants and characterized key steps in chlorophyll biosynthesis of the CWh leaves. These results contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of pigment biosynthesis in the CWh leaf cells of A. comosus var. bracteatus."
https://openalex.org/W2579173001,"Caveolae are protein-dense plasma membrane domains structurally composed of caveolin-1 or -3 along with other proteins. Our previous studies have shown that caveolae enhance calcium signals generated through the Gαq/phospholipase Cβ signaling pathway and that subjecting cells to hypo-osmotic stress reverses this enhancement. In this study, we have used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy supplemented by fluorescence correlation studies to determine the structural factors that underlie this behavior. We find similar and significant population of Gαq and one of its receptors, bradykinin type 2 receptor (B2R), as well as a significant population of Gαi and its coupled β2-adrenergic receptor (βAR), are localized to caveola domains. Although mild osmotic stress deforms caveolae and alters interactions between the caveolae and these proteins, the general structure and the localization of caveola components remain largely unchanged. This deformation eliminates the ability of caveolae to stabilize calcium signals mediated through Gαq-B2R, but does not affect cAMP signals mediated through Gαi and βAR. Structurally, we find that mild osmotic stress corresponding roughly to a pressure of 3.82 newtons/m2 increases the domain diameter by ∼30% and increases the fluorescence intensity in the center of the domain mouth suggesting a flattening of the invagination. Approximate calculations show that caveolae in muscle tissue have the strength to handle the stress of muscle movement."
https://openalex.org/W2255073668,"Objective This study estimates the effect of a targeted early childhood intervention program on global and experienced measures of maternal well-being utilizing a randomized controlled trial design. The primary aim of the intervention is to improve children’s school readiness skills by working directly with parents to improve their knowledge of child development and parenting behavior. One potential externality of the program is well-being benefits for parents given its direct focus on improving parental coping, self-efficacy, and problem solving skills, as well as generating an indirect effect on parental well-being by targeting child developmental problems. Methods Participants from a socio-economically disadvantaged community are randomly assigned during pregnancy to an intensive 5-year home visiting parenting program or a control group. We estimate and compare treatment effects on multiple measures of global and experienced well-being using permutation testing to account for small sample size and a stepdown procedure to account for multiple testing. Results The intervention has no impact on global well-being as measured by life satisfaction and parenting stress or experienced negative affect using episodic reports derived from the Day Reconstruction Method (DRM). Treatment effects are observed on measures of experienced positive affect derived from the DRM and a measure of mood yesterday. Conclusion The limited treatment effects suggest that early intervention programs may produce some improvements in experienced positive well-being, but no effects on negative aspects of well-being. Different findings across measures may result as experienced measures of well-being avoid the cognitive biases that impinge upon global assessments."
https://openalex.org/W2576754463,"Australian rangelands ecosystems cover 81% of the continent but are understudied and continental-scale research has been limited in part by a lack of precise data that are standardised between jurisdictions. We present a new dataset from AusPlots Rangelands that enables integrative rangelands analysis due to its geographic scope and standardised methodology. The method provides data on vegetation and soils, enabling comparison of a suite of metrics including fractional vegetation cover, basal area, and species richness, diversity, and composition. Cover estimates are robust and repeatable, allowing comparisons among environments and detection of modest change. The 442 field plots presented here span a rainfall gradient of 129–1437 mm Mean annual precipitation with varying seasonality. Vegetation measurements include vouchered vascular plant species, growth form, basal area, height, cover and substrate type from 1010 point intercepts as well as systematically recorded absences, which are useful for predictive modelling and validation of remote sensing applications. Leaf and soil samples are sampled for downstream chemical and genomic analysis. We overview the sampling of vegetation parameters and environments, applying the data to the question of how species abundance distributions (SADs) vary over climatic gradients, a key question for the influence of environmental change on ecosystem processes. We found linear relationships between SAD shape and rainfall within grassland and shrubland communities, indicating more uneven abundance in deserts and suggesting relative abundance may shift as a consequence of climate change, resulting in altered diversity and ecosystem function. The standardised data of AusPlots enables such analyses at large spatial scales, and the testing of predictions through time with longitudinal sampling. In future, the AusPlots field program will be directed towards improving coverage of space, under-represented environments, vegetation types and fauna and, increasingly, re-sampling of established plots. Providing up-to-date data access methods to enhance re-use is also a priority."

CRP, in its non-native pentameric structural conformation, binds to a variety of deposited, denatured, and aggregated proteins, in addition to binding to PCh-containing substances. In this study, we investigated the effects of H2O2, a prototypical reactive oxygen species that is also present at sites of inflammation, on the ligand recognition function of CRP. Controlled H2O2 treatment of native CRP did not monomerize CRP and did not affect the PCh binding activity of CRP. In solid phase ELISA-based ligand binding assays, purified pentameric H2O2-treated CRP bound to a number of immobilized proteins including oxidized LDL, IgG, amyloid β peptide 1–42, C4b-binding protein, and factor H, in a CRP concentration- and ligand concentration-dependent manner. Using oxidized LDL as a representative protein ligand for H2O2-treated CRP, we found that the binding occurred in a Ca2+-independent manner and did not involve the PCh-binding site of CRP. We conclude that H2O2 is a biological modifier of the structure and ligand recognition function of CRP. Overall, the data suggest that the ligand recognition function of CRP is dependent on the presence of an inflammatory microenvironment. We hypothesize that one of the functions of CRP at sites of inflammation is to sense the inflammatory microenvironment, change its own structure in response but remain pentameric, and then bind to pathogenic proteins deposited at those sites.

https://openalex.org/W2574563682,"Tropical rainforests harbor extraordinary biodiversity. The Amazon basin is thought to hold 30% of all river fish species in the world. Information about the ecology, reproduction, and recruitment of most species is still lacking, thus hampering fisheries management and successful conservation strategies. One of the key understudied issues in the study of population dynamics is recruitment. Fish larval ecology in tropical biomes is still in its infancy owing to identification difficulties. Molecular techniques are very promising tools for the identification of larvae at the species level. However, one of their limits is obtaining individual sequences with large samples of larvae. To facilitate this task, we developed a new method based on the massive parallel sequencing capability of next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with hybridization capture. We focused on the mitochondrial marker cytochrome oxidase I (COI). The results obtained using the new method were compared with individual larval sequencing. We validated the ability of the method to identify Amazonian catfish larvae at the species level and to estimate the relative abundance of species in batches of larvae. Finally, we applied the method and provided evidence for strong temporal variation in reproductive activity of catfish species in the Ucayalí River in the Peruvian Amazon. This new time and cost effective method enables the acquisition of large datasets, paving the way for a finer understanding of reproductive dynamics and recruitment patterns of tropical fish species, with major implications for fisheries management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2574632721,"B. parapertussis is a whooping cough etiological agent with the ability to evade the immune response induced by pertussis vaccines. We previously demonstrated that in the absence of opsonic antibodies B. parapertussis hampers phagocytosis by neutrophils and macrophages and, when phagocytosed, blocks intracellular killing by interfering with phagolysosomal fusion. But neutrophils can kill and/or immobilize extracellular bacteria through non-phagocytic mechanisms such as degranulation and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). In this study we demonstrated that B. parapertussis also has the ability to circumvent these two neutrophil extracellular bactericidal activities. The lack of neutrophil degranulation was found dependent on the O antigen that targets the bacteria to cell lipid rafts, eventually avoiding the fusion of nascent phagosomes with specific and azurophilic granules. IgG opsonization overcame this inhibition of neutrophil degranulation. We further observed that B. parapertussis did not induce NETs release in resting neutrophils and inhibited NETs formation in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) stimulation by a mechanism dependent on adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA)-mediated inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Thus, B. parapertussis modulates neutrophil bactericidal activity through two different mechanisms, one related to the lack of proper NETs-inducer stimuli and the other one related to an active inhibitory mechanism. Together with previous results these data suggest that B. parapertussis has the ability to subvert the main neutrophil bactericidal functions, inhibiting efficient clearance in non-immune hosts."

In order to evaluate the antioxidant activity of Ginkgo biloba pollen, and rapidly screen its antioxidative components, the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging ability, total flavonoid, total phenol, and proanthocyanidin of Ginkgo biloba pollen were determined and compared with those of Ginkgo biloba leaf and nut, and the off-line DPPH-HPLC-PAD and HPLC-ESI-MS2 were applied for screening and identifying the antioxidant flavonoids in Ginkgo biloba pollen. The results showed that the DPPH scavenging ability of Ginkgo biloba pollen was much higher than Ginkgo biloba nut, but lower than Ginkgo biloba leaf, while the total content of flavonoid in Ginkgo biloba pollen was approximately 4.37 times higher than in Ginkgo biloba leaf. Further studies found that the major flavonol aglycone in Ginkgo biloba pollen was kaempferol, which accounted for 96.71% of the total aglycones (includes quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin), and the main flavonoid components in Ginkgo biloba pollen were flavonoid glycosides. Finally, ten antioxidant peaks were screened and identified to be flavonoids (including kaempferol and nine flavonoid glycosides), so flavonoids were likely to be the main antioxidant components in GP, and among them, three novel kaempferol glycosides (peaks 1, 2, and 3) were found in Ginkgo biloba pollen for the first time, which had never been found in Ginkgo biloba."

HKs result from the rearrangement of a di-endoperoxide intermediate formed in the COX-2-dependent oxygenation of 5S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5S-HETE). We analyzed HK biosynthesis in human leukocytes stimulated ex vivo and defined the biosynthetic roles of 5-LOX and COX-2, using inhibitors and incubations with exogenous substrates. Activation of leukocytes with LPS followed by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187 resulted in the formation of PGE2, 5-HETE, and LTB4 as the principal metabolites of COX-2 and 5-LOX, respectively. The formation of HKD2 and HKE2 was highest after 15 min LPS treatment, and at that time, levels were similar to PGE2, but less than 5-HETE and LTB4 The time course of HK formation paralleled that of 5-HETE and LTB4, implying the availability of the 5S-HETE substrate as a limiting factor in biosynthesis rather than expression levels of COX-2. Specific inhibitors of COX-2 and 5-LOX decreased formation of HKD2 and HKE2 Platelets did not form HKs from exogenous 5S-HETE, implying that COX-1 is not involved. HKs are early products during an inflammatory event and require cells that express 5-LOX and COX-2 for their biosynthesis.-Giménez-Bastida, J. A., Shibata, T., Uchida, K., Schneider, C.

https://openalex.org/W2571953220,"In eukaryotes, the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 onto protein targets is an important post-translational modification. The best understood neddylation targets are the cullins, scaffold subunits of E3 ubiquitin ligases, where neddylation as well as deneddylation, facilitated by the protease activity of the CSN (COP9 signalosome), are required to control ubiquitin ligase assembly, function, and ultimately substrate degradation. Little is known about the role of other deneddylating enzymes besides CSN and the role of neddylation and deneddylation of their substrates. We previously characterized Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with defects in the conserved NEDD8-specific protease DEN1 (DENEDDYLASE1). These mutants display only subtle growth phenotypes despite the strong accumulation of a broad range of neddylated proteins. Specifically, we identified AXR1 (AUXIN-RESISTANT1), a subunit of the heterodimeric NAE (E1 NEDD8-ACTIVATING ENZYME), as highly neddylated in den1 mutants. Here, we examined the mechanism and consequences of AXR1 neddylation in more detail. We find that AXR1 as well as other neddylation enzymes are autoneddylated at multiple lysines. NAE autoneddylation can be linked to reduced NCE (E2 NEDD8-CONJUGATING ENZYME) NEDD8 thioester levels, either by critically reducing the pool of free NEDD8 or by reducing NAE activity. In planta, increasing NEDD8 gene dosage is sufficient to suppress den1 mutant phenotypes. We therefore suggest that DEN1 serves to recover diverted NEDD8 moieties from autoneddylated NAE subunits, and possibly also other neddylated proteins, to maintain NEDD8 pathway activity toward other NEDD8-dependent processes such as cullin E3 ligase regulation.

Like ubiquitin, NEDD8 requires maturation by C-terminal proteolytic processing of NEDD8 precursor forms. DEN1 was originally isolated as a NEDD8-specific C-terminal processing enzyme based on its in vitro activity (26.Gan-Erdene T. Nagamalleswari K. Yin L. Wu K. Pan Z.Q. Wilkinson K.D.

However, NEDD8 processing is not detectably impaired in den1 mutants from fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), fungi (Aspergillus nidulans), Arabidopsis, Drosophila, or mice, suggesting that the in vivo activity of DEN1 may be different from its reported in vitro activity, or that other functionally redundant proteases can process NEDD8 in den1 mutants (27.Christmann M.

Because den1 mutants from different species accumulate high levels of neddylated substrates of a broad molecular range, it was instead concluded that DEN1 serves in vivo to deconjugate NEDD8 from neddylated substrates (27.Christmann M.

Our previous comparative analyses of den1 and csn5 mutants from Arabidopsis thaliana showed that, at least in Arabidopsis, DEN1 is specifically required to remove NEDD8 from neddylated substrates other than cullins (31.Mergner J.

We further identified AXR1 and, indirectly, also the paralogous AXL as prominent NEDD8-modified proteins that depend on DEN1 for deneddylation (31.Mergner J. Heinzlmeir S. Kuster B. Schwechheimer C.

AXR1 and AXL share ∼80% amino acid identity, and both can form a complex with ECR1 (E1 C-TERMINAL RELATED1) (23.Dharmasiri N. Dharmasiri S. Weijers D. Karunarathna N. Jurgens G. Estelle M.

Arabidopsis auxin-resistance gene AXR1 encodes a protein related to ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1.Nature. 1993; 364: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). While den1 mutants show no obvious growth defects, the den1 mutation has a clear effect on plant growth in an AXR1-sensitized background, specifically, an axr1-30 Myc:AXR1 complementation line where the expression of a Myc-tagged AXR1 transgene only partially rescues the axr1-30 mutant phenotype (31.Mergner J.

Biol. 2011; 75: 515-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). This suggests that AXR1 neddylation negatively affects the neddylation pathway in den1 mutant backgrounds. It is, however, not yet understood what mechanisms lead to AXR1 neddylation in the first place, which steps of the neddylation cascade are affected by AXR1 neddylation, and whether this modification serves a regulatory function. Here, we examine the molecular mechanism and consequences of AXR1 neddylation. We show that AXR1 and other neddylation enzymes are autoneddylated in an E2- and E3-independent manner in vitro and that AXR1 autoneddylation impairs NEDD8 E2∼thioester formation in the den1 mutant background in vivo. We further show that increasing NEDD8 gene dosage is sufficient to suppress den1 mutant phenotypes suggesting that the non-covalent NEDD8 pool may be limiting in den1. Taken together, our data indicate that DEN1 functions to maintain NEDD8 pathway activity by recovering diverted NEDD8 moieties from proteins of the NEDD8 conjugation machinery. In Arabidopsis, the heterodimeric NAE is composed of the subunits ECR1 and AXR1 or the paralogous AXL. During NEDD8 activation, a thioester is formed between NEDD8 (NEDD8∼) and ECR1. The activated NEDD8 is then passed on, through a trans-thioester reaction, to the NCE enzyme RCE1 (RUB1-CONJUGATING ENZYME1) (5.Dharmasiri S. Dharmasiri N. Hellmann H. Estelle M. The RUB/Nedd8 conjugation pathway is required for early development in Arabidopsis.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1762-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 35.Pozo J.C. Timpte C. Tan S. Callis J. Estelle M. The ubiquitin-related protein RUB1 and auxin response in Arabidopsis.Science. 1998; 280: 1760-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). We have previously identified AXR1 as a neddylated protein from Arabidopsis wild type extracts and shown that AXR1-NEDD8 accumulates as a prominent neddylated protein in protein extracts from den1 mutants (31.Mergner J. Heinzlmeir S. Kuster B. Schwechheimer C. DENEDDYLASE1 deconjugates NEDD8 from non-cullin protein substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2015; 27: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To understand the molecular mechanism underlying this modification, we performed in vitro neddylation experiments with purified recombinant NEDD8 (His:HA:NEDD8), AXR1 (His:AXR1), and ECR1 (GST:ECR1) (Fig. 1A). Following incubation with both NAE subunits, NEDD8 was, as expected, conjugated to ECR1 but unexpectedly also to AXR1 (Fig. 1B). However, when each NAE subunit was examined individually, neither AXR1 nor ECR1 was NEDD8-modified, indicating that NAE activity was required for these modifications to occur (Fig. 1B). To characterize the biochemical nature of the observed NEDD8 conjugation, the reactions were performed in the presence or absence of DTT, which reduces thioester linkages but has no effect on isopeptide bonds. In the presence of the reducing agent, NEDD8 could be removed from ECR1 but not from AXR1 (Fig. 1B). We thus concluded that AXR1 is NEDD8-modified in vitro, concurrent with our previous report that AXR1 is NEDD8-modified in vivo and that this reaction can occur in an NCE-independent manner (31.Mergner J. Heinzlmeir S. Kuster B. Schwechheimer C. DENEDDYLASE1 deconjugates NEDD8 from non-cullin protein substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2015; 27: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To examine whether the recombinant NAE heterodimer consisting of separately expressed and purified His:AXR1 and GST:ECR1 was formed correctly and functional, we repeated the neddylation reaction and included the NCE conjugation enzyme RCE1 (Fig. 1C). RCE1 was efficiently NEDD8-conjugated in this experiment, thus confirming the functionality of the NAE (Fig. 1C). However, not all of this conjugate was DTT-sensitive suggesting that a fraction of the NEDD8 modification was bound by an isopeptide bond rather than by a thioester (Fig. 1C). Because we had previously shown that the deneddylating enzyme DEN1 could cleave isopeptide bonds, we added DEN1 to the reaction. Although DEN1 treatment only weakly reduced the RCE1∼NEDD8 signal under non-reducing conditions, a complete deneddylation of RCE1 was achieved when DEN1 was combined with the DTT treatment (Fig. 1C). In a subsequent experiment, we pre-incubated recombinant NAE (FLAG:AXR1/ECR1:His) with proteolytically active or inactive DEN1 before the addition of RCE1 and an additional incubation for 5 or 30 min, respectively (Fig. 1D). A quantitative analysis of RCE1∼NEDD8 thioester formation, based on the signal intensities measured from the anti-HA (NEDD8) and anti-FLAG (RCE1) immunoblots, showed only a slight difference in NAE-NCE trans-thiolation efficiency in the presence of active or inactive DEN1 (Fig. 1E). Although we observed reduced signal intensities after the 30-min reaction with DEN1C166A, this could be explained by the covalent neddylation of RCE1 (REC1-NEDD8) because only the RCE1∼NEDD8 thioester band was used for the quantitative analysis (Fig. 1, D and E). This result thus suggests that the covalent NAE-NEDD8 modification has no strong effect on NAE enzymatic activity under these experimental conditions. However, only a small fraction of AXR1 was neddylated in our in vitro reactions, which could potentially lead to an underestimation of its in vivo effect (Fig. 1, D and E). Because our in vitro experiments suggested that RCE1 may also become autoneddylated in vivo, we re-examined mass spectrometric data from a previously published study of a two-step protein purification performed under denaturing conditions of His:StrepII-tagged NEDD8 conjugates purified from Arabidopsis den1 mutant plants (31.Mergner J. Heinzlmeir S. Kuster B. Schwechheimer C. DENEDDYLASE1 deconjugates NEDD8 from non-cullin protein substrates in Arabidopsis thaliana.Plant Cell. 2015; 27: 741-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Similar to AXR1 and CUL1 (cullin 1), RCE1 was enriched during both purification steps suggesting that DEN1-sensitive and DTT-insensitive NEDD8 modifications of RCE1 were present not only in vitro but also in vivo (Fig. 1F). When increasing the NAE input in the in vitro reaction, we detected not only one but two DTT-insensitive bands after an extended incubation time (Fig. 2A). These bands could be explained by the expected molecular weight shift of neddylated AXR1 or ECR1, respectively (Fig. 2A). To confirm the protein identity of the designated bands and to map the residues of AXR1 and ECR1 carrying NEDD8 modifications, we analyzed the excised gel pieces, band A and band B, by mass spectrometry. AXR1 could be identified as the most highly abundant protein in band A and ECR1 as the most highly abundant protein in band B. For AXR1, we detected the typical Gly-Gly (glycine-glycine) footprint that remains after tryptic digest of a NEDD8 isopeptide-conjugated Lys on five different AXR1 Lys residues (Lys-21, -222, -262, -350, and -383) (Figs. 2B and 3A). For ECR1, we detected in total seven different Lys carrying the Gly-Gly footprint (Lys-20, -99, -101, -185, -243, -412, and -424) (Figs. 2B and 3B). Because we observed a discrete band of the modified subunits, we reasoned that AXR1 and ECR1 are interchangeably mononeddylated at different Lys residues rather than being polyneddylated at multiple sites at the same time. We positioned these modified Lys on the predicted structure of AXR1-ECR1, which we had modeled on the structure of the human NAE composed of APPBP1 and UBA3 (AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN-BINDING PROTEIN1 and UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER ACTIVATING ENZYME3; Fig. 2B). There, we found many of the modified Lys to be surface-exposed and close to, but not in absolute vicinity of, the NEDD8-reactive Cys-215 of ECR1. In AXR1, the modified Lys were on average closer to Cys-215 (about 30 Å) than the non-modified Lys (about 45 Å; Fig. 2C). This was not observed in ECR1, but in ECR1 all Lys residues were on average closer to Cys-215 (35–40 Å) than the non-modified Lys found in AXR1 (Fig. 2C). We also examined whether these Lys modifications may interfere with NAE and NCE function. Two of the neddylated Lys of ECR1 (Lys-20 and Lys-185) were positioned at the interface of ECR1 with AXR1 and may therefore disturb the AXR1-ECR1 interaction. In turn, ECR1 Lys-412 was positioned on the UBL domain, which facilitates the interaction with the NCE, and the modification on this residue may thus potentially interfere with the NAE-NCE interaction (8.Walden H.

CRF were defined as incident diagnoses through 2011, by ICD-9 code, of metabolic syndrome, glucose/insulin disorder, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or overweight/obesity (in those not initially overweight/obese). Multivariable-adjusted proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between BMI categories at accession and CRF. Initially underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m2) were 2.4% of Soldiers, 53.5% were normal weight (18.5−<25), 34.2% were overweight (25−<30), and 10.0% were obese (≥30). Mean age range at CRF diagnosis was 24–29 years old, with generally low CRF incidence: 228 with metabolic syndrome, 3,880 with a glucose/insulin disorder, 26,373 with hypertension, and 13,404 with dyslipidemia. Of the Soldiers who were not overweight or obese at accession, 5,361 were eventually diagnosed as overweight or obese. Relative to Soldiers who were normal weight at accession, those who were overweight or obese, respectively, had significantly higher risk of developing each CRF after multivariable adjustment (HR [95% CI]: metabolic syndrome: 4.13 [2.87–5.94], 13.36 [9.00–19.83]; glucose/insulin disorder: 1.39 [1.30–1.50], 2.76 [2.52–3.04]; hypertension: 1.85 [1.80–1.90], 3.31 [3.20–3.42]; dyslipidemia: 1.81 [1.75–1.89], 3.19 [3.04–3.35]). Risk of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and overweight/obesity in initially underweight Soldiers was 40%, 31%, and 79% lower, respectively, versus normal-weight Soldiers. BMI in early adulthood has important implications for cardiometabolic health, even within young, physically active populations."

https://openalex.org/W2575397726,"The bromodomain containing 1 gene, BRD1 is essential for embryogenesis and CNS development. It encodes a protein that participates in histone modifying complexes and thereby regulates the expression of a large number of genes. Genetic variants in the BRD1 locus show association with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and risk alleles in the promoter region correlate with reduced BRD1 expression. Insights into the transcriptional regulation of BRD1 and the pathogenic mechanisms associated with BRD1 risk variants, however, remain sparse. By studying transcripts in human HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells we provide evidence for differences in relative expression of BRD1 transcripts with three alternative 5’ UTRs (exon 1C, 1B, and 1A). We further show that expression of these transcript variants covaries negatively with DNA methylation proportions in their upstream promoter regions suggesting that promoter usage might be regulated by DNA methylation. In line with findings that the risk allele of the rs138880 SNP in the BRD1 promoter region correlates with reduced BRD1 expression, we find that it is also associated with moderate regional BRD1 promoter hypermethylation in both adipose tissue and blood. Importantly, we demonstrate by inspecting available DNA methylation and expression data that these regions undergo changes in methylation during fetal brain development and that differences in their methylation proportions in fetal compared to postnatal frontal cortex correlate significantly with BRD1 expression. These findings suggest that BRD1 may be dysregulated in both the developing and mature brain of risk allele carriers. Finally, we demonstrate that commonly used mood stabilizers Lithium, Valproate, and Carbamazepine affect the expression of BRD1 in SH-SY5Y cells. Altogether this study indicates a link between genetic risk and epigenetic dysregulation of BRD1 which raises interesting perspectives for targeting the mechanisms pharmacologically."
https://openalex.org/W2575733938,"Several studies indicate that the fetal environment plays a significant role in the development of cardiometabolic disease later in life. However, a few studies present conflicting data about the correlation between birth weight and the impairment of cardiac autonomic modulation. The purpose of the present study was to provide further knowledge to elucidate this contradictory relationship. One hundred children aged 5 and 14 years had anthropometric parameters, body composition and blood pressure levels determined. Heart rate variability (HRV) was evaluated by heart rate monitoring, including measurements of both the time and frequency domains. The results showed inverse correlation between the HRV parameters with BMI (RMSSD: P = 0.047; PNN50: P = 0.021; HF: P = 0.041), systolic (RMSSD: P = 0.023; PNN50: P = 0.032) and diastolic (PNN50: P = 0.030) blood pressure levels. On the other hand, there were consistent positive correlations between the HRV parameters and birth weight (RMSSD: P = 0.001; PNN50: P = 0.001; HF: P = 0.002). To determine the effect of birth weight on HRV parameters, we perform multivariate linear regression analysis adjusted for potentially confounding factors (prematurity, gender, age, BMI, physical activity index and SBP levels). These findings were preserved even after adjusting for these confounders. Our results suggested that impaired cardiac autonomic modulation characterized by a reduction in the parasympathetic activity occurs in children with low birth weight. One possible interpretation for these data is that a vagal withdrawal, rather than a sympathetic overactivity, could precede the development of hypertension and other cardiometabolic diseases in children with low birth weight. However, long-term studies should be performed to investigate this possibility."

However, the effect of choline deficiency on the severity of colitis has not been investigated. In the present study, we investigated the role of choline deficiency in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet lowered the levels of type II natural killer T (NKT) cells in the colonic lamina propria, peritoneal cavity, and mesenteric lymph nodes, and increased the levels of type II NKT cells in the livers of wild-type B6 mice compared with that in mice fed a control (CTR) diet. The gene expression pattern of the chemokine receptor CXCR6, which promotes NKT cell accumulation, varied between colon and liver in a manner dependent on the changes in the type II NKT cell levels. To examine the role of type II NKT cells in colitis under choline-deficient conditions, we assessed the severity of DSS-induced colitis in type I NKT cell-deficient (Jα18-/-) or type I and type II NKT cell-deficient (CD1d-/-) mice fed the MCD or CTR diets. The MCD diet led to amelioration of inflammation, decreases in interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-4 secretion, and a decrease in the number of IFN-γ and IL-4-producing NKT cells in Jα18-/- mice but not in CD1d-/- mice. Finally, adaptive transfer of lymphocytes with type II NKT cells exacerbated DSS-induced colitis in Jα18-/- mice with MCD diet. These results suggest that choline deficiency causes proinflammatory type II NKT cell loss and alleviates DSS-induced colitis. Thus, inflammation in DSS-induced colitis under choline deficiency is caused by type II NKT cell-dependent mechanisms, including decreased type II NKT cell and proinflammatory cytokine levels."

The animals were randomly divided into two experimental groups: Control Group (n = 06) injected with a vehicle (sodium citrate buffer solution) and Diabetic Group (n = 06) consisting of rats submitted to intraperitoneal administration of streptozotocin. MR was performed 24 days after the induction of diabetes and images were used for morphometry using ImageJ software. Morphology of the collagen fibers within tendons was examined using Atomic Force microscopy (AFM). An increase in the dimension of the coronal plane area was observed in the diabetic group (8.583 ± 0.646 mm2/100g) when compared to the control group (4.823 ± 0.267 mm2/100g) resulting in a significant difference (p = 0.003) upon evaluating the Achilles tendons. Similarly, our analysis found an increase in the size of the transverse section area in the diabetic group (1.328 ± 0.103 mm2/100g) in comparison to the control group (0.940 ± 0.01 mm2/100g) p = 0.021. The tendons of the diabetic group showed great irregularity in fiber bundles, including modified grain direction and jagged junctions and deformities in the form of collagen fibrils bulges. Despite the morphological changes observed in the Achilles tendon of diabetic animals, IL1 and TNF-α did not change. Our results suggest that DM promotes changes to the Achilles tendon with important structural modifications as seen by MR and AFM, excluding major inflammatory changes."

We selected the best fit models and modified them. The results showed that the published model ln(B(Biomass)) = a + b * ln(D) + c * (ln(H))2 + d * (ln(H))3 + e * ln(WD) had the best fit for estimating the tree biomass of Chinese Fir stands. Furthermore, we observed that variables D(diameter at breast height), H (height), and WD(wood density)were significantly correlated with the total tree biomass estimation model. As a result, a natural logarithm structure gave the best estimates for the tree biomass structure. Finally, when a multi-step improvement on tree biomass model was performed, the tree biomass model with Tree volume(TV), WD and biomass wood density conversion factor (BECF),achieved the highest simulation accuracy, expressed as ln(TB) = -0.0703 + 0.9780 * ln(TV) + 0.0213 * ln(WD) + 1.0166 * ln(BECF). Therefore, when TV, WD and BECF were combined with tree biomass volume coefficient bi for Chinese Fir, the stand biomass (SB)model included both volume(SV) and coefficient bi variables of the stand as follows: bi = Exp(-0.0703+0.9780*ln(TV)+0.0213 * ln(WD)+1.0166*ln(BECF)). The stand biomass model is SB = SV/TV * bi."

Multiple MRIs and CBCT images were registered using a mutual information based algorithm. The articular disc, condylar head and glenoid fossa were segmented at two different occasions, at least one-week apart, by one investigator, and 3D models were reconstructed. Differences between the segmentation at two occasions were automatically measured using the surface contours (Average Perpendicular Distance) and the volume overlap (Dice Similarity Index) of the 3D models. Descriptive analysis of the changes at 2 occasions, including means and standard deviation (SD) were reported to describe the intra-examiner reproducibility.The automatic segmentation of the condyle revealed maximum distance change of 1.9±0.93 mm, similarity index of 98% and root mean squared distance of 0.1±0.08 mm, and the glenoid fossa revealed maximum distance change of 2±0.52 mm, similarity index of 96% and root mean squared distance of 0.2±0.04 mm. The manual segmentation of the articular disc revealed maximum distance change of 3.6±0.32 mm, similarity index of 80% and root mean squared distance of 0.3±0.1 mm.The MRI-CBCT registration provides a reliable tool to reconstruct 3D models of the TMJ's soft and hard tissues, allows quantification of the articular disc morphology and position changes with associated differences of the condylar head and glenoid fossa, and facilitates measuring tissue changes over time."

https://openalex.org/W2573455794,"Sudden death syndrome (SDS) is caused by the fungal pathogen, Fusarium virguliforme, and is a major threat to soybean production in North America. There are two major components of this disease: (i) root necrosis and (ii) foliar SDS. Root symptoms consist of root necrosis with vascular discoloration. Foliar SDS is characterized by interveinal chlorosis and leaf necrosis, and in severe cases by flower and pod abscission. A major toxin involved in initiating foliar SDS has been identified. Nothing is known about how root necrosis develops. In order to unravel the mechanisms used by the pathogen to cause root necrosis, the transcriptome of the pathogen in infected soybean root tissues of a susceptible cultivar, ‘Essex’, was investigated. The transcriptomes of the germinating conidia and mycelia were also examined. Of the 14,845 predicted F. virguliforme genes, we observed that 12,017 (81%) were expressed in germinating conidia and 12,208 (82%) in mycelia and 10,626 (72%) in infected soybean roots. Of the 10,626 genes induced in infected roots, 224 were transcribed only following infection. Expression of several infection-induced genes encoding enzymes with oxidation-reduction properties suggests that degradation of antimicrobial compounds such as the phytoalexin, glyceollin, could be important in early stages of the root tissue infection. Enzymes with hydrolytic and catalytic activities could play an important role in establishing the necrotrophic phase. The expression of a large number of genes encoding enzymes with catalytic and hydrolytic activities during the late infection stages suggests that cell wall degradation could be involved in root necrosis and the establishment of the necrotrophic phase in this pathogen."
https://openalex.org/W2572253247,"Polyembryony-the production of multiple cloned embryos from a single fertilised egg-is a seemingly paradoxical combination of reproductive modes that nevertheless persists in diverse taxa. We document features of polyembryony in the Cyclostomata (Bryozoa)-an ancient order of modular colonial marine invertebrates-that suggest a substantial reduction in the paradoxical nature of this enigmatic reproductive mode. Firstly, we provide molecular evidence for polyembryony in three exemplar species, supporting the widely cited inference that polyembryony characterises the entire order. Secondly, genotyping demonstrates protracted release of cloned offspring from the primary embryo in a given gonozooid (chamber for embryonic incubation), thus exposing the same genotype to changing environmental conditions over time. Finally, we confirm that each gonozooid produces a distinct genotype, with each primary embryo being the result of a separate fertilisation event. We hypothesise that the sustained release of one or a few genotypes against varying environmental conditions achieves levels of risk-spreading similar to those in organisms that release multiple, unique genotypes at a single time. We argue that polyembryony, specifically with the production of a large number of progeny per fertilisation event, has been favoured in the Cyclostomata over long geological periods."

The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of this CAD software during screening for vertebral metastases on follow-up CT images of primary lung cancer patients.The interpretation experiment included 30 sets of follow-up CT scans in primary lung cancer patients and was performed by two readers (readers A and B), who each had 2.5 years' experience reading CT images. In 395 vertebrae from C6 to L3, 46 vertebral metastases were identified as follows: osteolytic metastases (n = 17), osteoblastic metastases (n = 14), combined osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases (n = 6), and pathological fractures (n = 9). Thirty-six lesions were in the anterior component (vertebral body), and 10 lesions were in the posterior component (vertebral arch, transverse process, and spinous process). The area under the curve (AUC) by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the sensitivity and specificity for detecting vertebral metastases were compared with and without CAD for each observer.Reader A detected 47 abnormalities on CT images without CAD, and 33 of them were true-positive metastatic lesions. Using CAD, reader A detected 57 abnormalities, and 38 were true positives. The sensitivity increased from 0.717 to 0.826, and on ROC curve analysis, AUC with CAD was significantly higher than that without CAD (0.849 vs. 0.902, p = 0.021). Reader B detected 40 abnormalities on CT images without CAD, and 36 of them were true-positive metastatic lesions. Using CAD, reader B detected 44 abnormalities, and 39 were true positives. The sensitivity increased from 0.783 to 0.848, and AUC with CAD was nonsignificantly higher than that without CAD (0.889 vs. 0.910, p = 0.341). Both readers detected more osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases with CAD than without CAD.Our temporal 3D-CT subtraction CAD software easily detected vertebral metastases on the follow-up CT images of lung cancer patients regardless of the osteolytic or osteoblastic nature of the lesions."

Research on heterogeneity has been extensive in recent years, but no clear solution has been reached. Heterogeneity is also observed in catalytic antibody κ light chains (CLs). In this study, we investigated how the constant region domain of CLs concerns structural diversity because it is a simple and good example for elucidating heterogeneity. By means of cation-exchange chromatography, SDS-PAGE, and 2-dimensional electrophoresis for the CL, multimolecular forms consisting of different electrical charges and molecular sizes coexisted in the solution, resulting in the similar heterogeneity of the full length of CLs. The addition of copper ion could cause the multimolecular forms to change to monomolecular forms. Copper ion contributed greatly to the enrichment of the dimer form of CL and the homogenization of the differently charged CLs. Two molecules of the CL protein bound one copper ion. The binding affinity of the ion was 48.0 μM-1 Several divalent metal ions were examined, but only zinc showed a similar effect.-Hifumi, E., Taguchi, H., Kato, R., Uda, T.

To further develop the nonhuman primate (NHP) model for investigating B cell dynamics in human aging and infectious disease, a flow cytometric panel was developed to characterize circulating rhesus B cell subsets. Significant differences between human and macaque B cells included the proportions of cells within IgD+ and switched memory populations and a prominent CD21-CD27+ unswitched memory population detected only in macaques. We then utilized the expanded panel to analyze B cell alterations associated with aging and acute simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in the NHP model. In the aging study, distinct patterns of B cell subset frequencies were observed for macaques aged one to five years compared to those between ages 5 and 30 years. In the SIV infection study, B cell frequencies and absolute number were dramatically reduced following acute infection, but recovered within four weeks of infection. Thereafter, the frequencies of activated memory B cells progressively increased; these were significantly correlated with the magnitude of SIV-specific IgG responses, and coincided with impaired maturation of anti-SIV antibody avidity, as previously reported for HIV-1 infection. These observations further validate the NHP model for investigation of mechanisms responsible for B cells alterations associated with immunosenescence and infectious disease."
https://openalex.org/W2574907350,"Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) is crucial to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in two of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway genes, NFKBIK and RELA, are associated with soluble ICAM1 (sICAM1) levels. However, neither of these two gene variants is found in the Asian populations. This study aimed to elucidate whether other candidate gene variants involved in the NF-κB pathway may be associated with sICAM1 levels in Taiwanese. After excluding carriers of the ICAM1 rs5491-T allele, three SNPs in the ICAM1 gene and eight SNPs in six of the NF-κB pathway genes (NFKB1, PDCD11, TNFAIP3, NKAPL, IKBKE, and PRKCB) were analyzed for their association with sICAM1 levels in 480 individuals. Our data showed that two SNPs, rs5498 of ICAM1 and rs1635 of NKAPL, were significantly associated with sICAM1 levels (P = 0.002 and 0.004, respectively) in the Taiwanese population. Using a multivariate analysis, rs5498 and rs1635 as well as the previously reported ABO genotypes and rs12051272 of the CDH13 gene were independently associated with sICAM1 levels (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.006 and 0.031, respectively). An analysis with combined risk alleles of four candidate SNPs in the ICAM1, NKAPL, ABO, and CDH13 genes showed an increase in sICAM1 levels with added numbers of risk alleles and weighted genetic risk score. Our findings thus expanded the repertoire of gene variants responsible for the regulation of sICAM1 levels in the Asian populations."
https://openalex.org/W2575685151,"The success of sustainable crop production depends on our ability to select or create varieties that can allocate resources to both growth and defence. However, breeding efforts have emphasized increases in yields but have partially neglected defence traits against pests. Estimating the costs of multiple defences against tuber herbivores and the tradeoffs among them, as well as understanding the relationship between yield and multiple defences is still unknown but relevant to both basic and applied ecology. Using twenty commercial potato varieties available in Colombia and the tuber herbivore Tecia solanivora, we tested whether high yielding varieties show a reduction in three types of defence: constitutive and induced resistance, as well as tolerance. Specifically, we determined (1) the costs in terms of yield of all three defences, (2) the possible tradeoffs among them, and (3) if oviposition preference was related to the expression of these defences. We detected no costs in terms of yield of constitutive and induced resistance to tuber damage. We did, however, find evidence of costs of being able to tolerate tuber herbivory. While we found no tradeoffs among any of the estimated defences, there was a positive correlation between aboveground compensatory growth and tolerance in terms of tuber production, suggesting that after damage there are no shifts in the allocation of resources from aboveground to belowground biomass. Finally, we found that females laid more eggs on those varieties with the lowest level of constitutive resistance. In conclusion our findings suggest that in potatoes, breeding for higher yields has not caused any reduction in constitutive or induced resistance to tuber damage. This is not the case for tolerance where those varieties with higher yields are also less likely to tolerate tuber damage. Given the high incidence of tuber pests in Colombia, selecting for higher tolerance could allow for high productivity in the presence of herbivores. Finding mechanisms to decouple the tolerance response from yield should be a new priority in potato breeding in Colombia to guarantee a higher yield in both the presence and absence of herbivores."

In the present study, we analyzed whether CT-1 also acts to peripherally regulate metabolic rhythms and adipose tissue core clock genes in mice. Moreover, the circadian pattern of plasma CT-1 levels was evaluated in normal-weight and overweight subjects. The circadian rhythmicity of oxygen consumption rate (VO2) was disrupted in aged obese CT-1-deficient (CT-1−/−) mice (12 mo). Although circadian rhythms of VO2 were conserved in young lean CT-1−/− mice (2 mo), CT-1 deficiency caused a phase shift of the acrophase. Most of the clock genes studied (Clock, Bmal1, and Per2) displayed a circadian rhythm in adipose tissue of both wild-type (WT) and CT-1−/− mice. However, the pattern was altered in CT-1−/− mice toward a lower percentage of the rhythm or lower amplitude, especially for Bmal1 and Clock. Moreover, CT-1 mRNA levels in adipose tissue showed significant circadian fluctuations in young WT mice. In humans, CT-1 plasma profile exhibited a 24-h circadian rhythm in normal-weight but not in overweight subjects. The 24-h pattern of CT-1 was characterized by a pronounced increase during the night (from 02:00 to 08:00). These observations suggest a potential role for CT-1 in the regulation of metabolic circadian rhythms. —Lópeź-Yoldi, M., Stanhope, K. L., Garaulet, M., Chen, X.

https://openalex.org/W2575985988,"The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) have been shown to regulate skeletal muscle function. Previously, we showed that MAPK phosphatase-5 (MKP-5) negatively regulates myogenesis and regeneration of skeletal muscle through inhibition of p38 MAPK and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). However, the identity and contribution of MKP-5-regulated MAPK targets in the control of skeletal muscle function and regenerative myogenesis have not been established. To identify MKP-5-regulated MAPK substrates in skeletal muscle, we performed a global differential phospho-MAPK substrate screen in regenerating skeletal muscles of wild type and MKP-5-deficient mice. We discovered a novel MKP-5-regulated MAPK substrate called guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rab3A (GRAB) that was hyperphosphorylated on a phospho-MAPK motif in skeletal muscle of MKP-5-deficient mice. GRAB was found to be phosphorylated by JNK on serine 169. Myoblasts overexpressing a phosphorylation-defective mutant of GRAB containing a mutation at Ser-169 to Ala-169 (GRAB-S169A) inhibited the ability of C2C12 myoblasts to differentiate. We found that GRAB phosphorylation at Ser-169 was required for the secretion of the promyogenic cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). Consistent with this observation, MKP-5-deficient mice exhibited increased circulating IL-6 expression as compared with wild type mice. Collectively, these data demonstrate a novel mechanism whereby MKP-5-mediated regulation of JNK negatively regulates phosphorylation of GRAB, which subsequently controls secretion of IL-6.

The maintenance of skeletal muscle function is a dynamic process that requires the interplay between skeletal muscle and trophic factors. An imbalance in the equilibrium between the factors that positively and negatively regulate skeletal muscle function is associated with diseases such as atrophy, cancer cachexia, muscular dystrophies, and neuromuscular disorders. Skeletal muscle produces and secretes a variety of cytokines and growth factors that control skeletal muscle growth and regeneration. In particular, interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the most prominent and has been defined as a myokine because of its production from the myofiber (6.Pedersen B.K.

The most abundantly hyperphosphorylated protein in undamaged skeletal muscle of mkp-5−/− mice was the glycogen-targeting subunit of protein phosphatase 1 encoded by the gene PPP1R3A (14.Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach A.A. Molecular cloning and expression of the regulatory (RG1) subunit of the glycogen-associated protein phosphatase.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the focus of this study was specifically on MKP-5 in regenerating skeletal muscle, we chose to focus on GRAB. To validate GRAB as a MKP-5-regulated MAPK substrate, we asked whether MKP-5 overexpression reduced GRAB phosphorylation. These experiments utilized 293 cells because endogenous levels of GRAB are undetectable in these cells, allowing for the indiscriminate detection of exogenously expressed phosphorylated FLAG-tagged GRAB. First, 293 cells were stimulated with anisomycin to increase the levels of phosphorylated MAPK substrates (Fig. 2A). As anticipated, in vector control-expressing 293 cells, anisomycin-induced GRAB phosphorylation was undetectable (Fig. 2A). When MKP-5 was co-overexpressed along with FLAG-GRAB, a reduction in phosphorylation levels of the MAPK substrate motif on GRAB was observed as detected using anti-phospho-MAPK substrate motif antibody (Fig. 2A). Further evidence that MKP-5 reduced GRAB phosphorylation was revealed by the observation that GRAB underwent a mobility shift in response to anisomycin stimulation that was attenuated upon MKP-5 overexpression (Fig. 2A). It remained formally possible that GRAB might be a direct MKP-5 substrate. Far Western immunoblotting showed that purified MKP-5, when incubated with either immobilized phosphorylated p38 MAPK or phosphorylated GRAB, effectively dephosphorylated the MKP-5 substrate p38 MAPK but failed to dephosphorylate GRAB under identical conditions (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that MKP-5 does not act directly on GRAB but rather indirectly affects MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of GRAB. Three putative GRAB phosphorylation sites in the context of the MAPK substrate motif (PXS*P or S*PX(R/K)) were identified, serine 169 (Ser-169), serine 180 (Ser-180), and threonine 182 (Thr-182) (Figs. 1C and 3A). To further validate these phosphorylation sites on GRAB, we mutated Ser-169, Ser-180, and Thr-182 to alanine (Fig. 3A). We found that GRAB-S169A-expressing cells showed undetectable levels of phosphorylation either in the absence or presence of anisomycin stimulation, whereas GRAB-T182A- and GRAB-S180A-expressing cells were readily detectable as phosphorylated (Fig. 3B). Moreover, when co-expressed with MKP-5, wild type GRAB phosphorylation was reduced either in the absence or presence of anisomycin stimulation to levels comparable with that of GRAB-S169A (Fig. 3B). Importantly, both GRAB-S180A and -T182A mutants were still detectably phosphorylated even when MKP-5 was overexpressed, demonstrating that these sites marginally contribute to the net level of MKP-5-regulated GRAB phosphorylation (Fig. 3B). These results suggest the possibility that GRAB Ser-180 and/or Thr-182 sites might be regulated in a MKP-5/MAPK-independent manner. Notably, the GRAB-S169A mutant failed to exhibit a comparable mobility shift following anisomycin stimulation as compared with wild type GRAB, further supporting Ser-169 as a site of stoichiometric GRAB phosphorylation (Fig. 3C). Finally, inspection of the surrounding GRAB Ser-169 amino acid sequence across a variety of species revealed that Ser-169 of GRAB is highly conserved (Fig. 3D). Thus, we conclude that Ser-169 represents a major GRAB phosphorylation site. To further examine Ser-169 phosphorylation, we established stable C2C12 myoblasts expressing either FLAG-tagged GRAB-WT, GRAB-S169A, or vector control (Fig. 4A). C2C12 myoblasts express endogenous GRAB, and the exogenously expressed FLAG-GRAB migrated with a slightly higher molecular weight and at expression levels that were ∼2-fold above that of endogenous GRAB (Fig. 4A). Additionally, we generated a phospho-Ser-169-specific GRAB antibody and showed that this antibody could readily detect phosphorylated GRAB in GRAB-WT cells but not in GRAB-S169A mutant-expressing cells (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, stimulation of GRAB-WT-overexpressing myoblasts with IGF-1, IL-1β, FGF-1, TNF-α, and IL-6 demonstrated that growth factors and cytokines are capable of inducing GRAB Ser-169 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C). Hence, GRAB is a target for phosphorylation at Ser-169 in response to a variety of cytokines and growth factors. To examine which MAPK could phosphorylate GRAB, GRAB-WT was co-expressed in 293 cells with constitutively active mutants of MKK6, MKK7, and MEK1, which activate their downstream cognate MAPK targets p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2, respectively. Each activated MKK or MEK induced the phosphorylation of GRAB-WT on Ser-169 as determined using the phosphoserine 169-specific GRAB (pGRAB) antibodies (Fig. 5, A–C). These results demonstrate the sufficiency of the MAPKs to phosphorylate GRAB on Ser-169. Next, we tested which MAPK is required for the phosphorylation of GRAB. It has been shown that infiltration of macrophages within the damaged muscle releases proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β that stimulate the expression of cytokines such as IL-6 (15.Luo G. Hershko D.D. Robb B.W. Wray C.J. Hasselgren P.O. IL-1β stimulates IL-6 production in cultured skeletal muscle cells through activation of MAP kinase signaling pathway and NF-κB.Am. J. Physiol. Regul.

Pro-inflammatory mediation of myoblast proliferation.PLoS One. 2014; 9: e92363Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). IL-6 subsequently acts to promote the repair process because mice lacking IL-6 fail to undergo regenerative myogenesis (7.Serrano A.L. Baeza-Raja B. Perdiguero E. Jardí M. Muñoz-Cánoves P. Interleukin-6 is an essential regulator of satellite cell-mediated skeletal muscle hypertrophy.Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 33-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). When GRAB-WT myoblasts were stimulated with IL-1β, we found that GRAB underwent phosphorylation on Ser-169 (Fig. 5, D–F). Pretreatment of myoblasts with inhibitors of p38 MAPK, JNK, and ERK1/2 revealed that only JNK inhibition significantly reduced basal GRAB Ser-169 phosphorylation and attenuated IL-1β-induced pGRAB as compared with cells treated with either p38 MAPK or JNK inhibitors (Fig. 5, D–F). These data suggest that JNK plays a predominately greater role than either p38 MAPK or ERK toward the phosphorylation of GRAB on Ser-169. To examine the functional significance of GRAB Ser-169 phosphorylation, we initially analyzed the proliferation and migration of C2C12 myoblasts stably expressing either GRAB-WT or GRAB-S169A mutant. No differences in either proliferation or migration were observed between GRAB-WT- and GRAB-S169A-expressing myoblasts (Fig. 6, A and B). Remarkably, when GRAB-WT and GRAB-S169A myoblasts were induced to undergo differentiation, we found that GRAB-S169A myoblasts were severely impaired in their ability to differentiate as compared with GRAB-WT myoblasts (Fig. 6C). The fusion index in GRAB-S169A-expressing myoblasts was significantly reduced as compared with GRAB-WT myoblasts, and this correlated with reduced expression levels of myosin heavy chain and myogenin (Fig. 6, D and E). These results strongly suggest that the appropriate phosphorylation of GRAB at Ser-169 is required for myogenesis. In an effort to further understand the pathways through which MKP-5/MAPK negatively regulates regenerative myogenesis (3.Shi H. Verma M. Zhang L. Dong C. Flavell R.A. Bennett A.M. Improved regenerative myogenesis and muscular dystrophy in mice lacking Mkp5.J. Clin. Investig. 2013; 123: 2064-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we noted that during skeletal muscle regeneration circulating IL-6 levels in mkp-5−/− mice were significantly increased as compared with mkp-5+/+ mice (Fig. 7A). Although mkp-5−/− mice had enhanced levels of secreted IL-6 during skeletal muscle regeneration compared with mkp-5+/+ mice, we found no difference in IL-6 mRNA expression between regenerating skeletal muscle of mkp-5+/+ and mkp-5−/− mice (Fig. 7, B and C). Consistent with the increased secretion of IL-6 during regeneration, skeletal muscles of mkp-5−/− mice showed enhanced levels of STAT-3 Tyr-705 phosphorylation (Fig. 7D). These data demonstrate that MKP-5 negatively regulates the levels of circulating IL-6 during regenerative myogenesis. GRAB functions as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rab3A small GTPase that is involved in cytokine, growth factor, neurotransmitter, and hormonal secretion (10.Luo H.R. Saiardi A.

Given the functional relevance of GRAB to the secretory pathway, we examined the functional significance of GRAB Ser-169 phosphorylation specifically on IL-6 secretion. Myoblasts expressing GRAB-S169A exhibited significantly reduced levels of IL-6 secretion (Fig. 8A) in the absence of any apparent change in either IL-6 mRNA expression or transcriptional activity of the proximal IL-6 promoter (Fig. 8, B and C). When GRAB-S169A myoblasts were stimulated with IL-1β, the levels of secreted IL-6 were significantly reduced as compared with GRAB-WT myoblasts (Fig. 8D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that GRAB Ser-169 phosphorylation plays an essential role in the secretion of IL-6 from myoblasts. Using a non-biased approach to identify putative MKP-5-regulated MAPK substrates, we performed differential phosphoproteomic analyses targeting the phospho-MAPK substrate motif in regenerating skeletal muscles. We identified GRAB as a major hyperphosphorylated MAPK substrate in regenerating skeletal muscle of mkp-5−/− mice. GRAB (Rab3il1) has been shown to be a GEF for Rab3A (10.Luo H.R. Saiardi A. Nagata E. Ye K. Yu H. Jung T.S. Luo X. Jain S. Sawa A. Snyder S.H.

Rab3A controls vesicular transport, membrane trafficking, and exocytosis (22.Mizuno-Yamasaki E. Rivera-Molina F. Novick P. GTPase networks in membrane traffic.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2012; 81: 637-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Based upon our analysis of other potential top hit substrates (Fig. 1C), we identified the following potential MKP-5-regulated MAPK substrates: 1) MRCKβ, 2) SRm160, 3) ARID1B, and 4) RBMS1. Interestingly, MRCKβ, which is known as the myotonic dystrophy kinase-related Cdc42 binding kinase β, is involved in actin-cytoskeleton signaling and is required for myosin light chain 2 and MYPT2 phosphorylation (23.Wilkinson S.

SRm160 is an RNA-binding protein (25.Blencowe B.J. Issner R. Nickerson J.A. Sharp P.A. A coactivator of pre-mRNA splicing.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 996-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), ARID1B is a Brahma-associated factor-associated protein involved in chromatin remodeling (26.Sim J.C. White S.M. Lockhart P.J. ARID1B-mediated disorders: mutations and possible mechanisms.Intractable Rare Dis. Res. 2015; 4: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and RBMS1 is a transcription factor RNA-binding motif that plays a role in regulating DNA replication, transcription, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression by interacting with c-Myc (27.Takai T. Nishita Y. Iguchi-Ariga S.M. Ariga H.

It is conceivable that these potential MAPK substrates also play additional roles as downstream targets that are regulated through MKP-5/MAPK in the control of skeletal muscle regeneration. Further work will be required to validate and subsequently investigate these MKP-5/MAPK targets for their role in regenerative myogenesis. In addition to demonstrating by mass spectrometry that GRAB is hyperphosphorylated in regenerating skeletal muscles of mkp-5−/− mice, several additional lines of evidence support the conclusion that GRAB is a MKP-5-regulated MAPK substrate. First, we show that overexpression of MKP-5 results in the dephosphorylation of MAPK and a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated GRAB in cells. Second, either activation of MKKs or inhibition of the MAPKs pharmacologically stimulated and inhibited GRAB phosphorylation, respectively. Specifically, JNK inhibition reduced GRAB phosphorylation basally and in response to IL-1β. Our dephosphorylation assays do not support the interpretation that GRAB is a direct substrate for MKP-5. Finally, mutation of Ser-169 to a non-phosphorylatable residue on GRAB that exists within a highly conserved MAPK motif completely abrogated GRAB phosphorylation. These data argue that GRAB is phosphorylated in skeletal muscle by MAPK and that JNK is the likely MAPK responsible for this phosphorylation. The ability of skeletal muscle to register changes in the extracellular environment and coordinately adapt is critical for the maintenance of skeletal muscle physiology. IL-6 can positively regulate regenerative myogenesis and skeletal muscle growth (28.Muñoz-Cánoves P. Scheele C. Pedersen B.K. Serrano A.L. Interleukin-6 myokine signaling in skeletal muscle: a double-edged sword?.FEBS J. 2013; 280: 4131-4148Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). However, understanding of the mechanisms of how the regulation of IL-6 expression is coupled to extracellular signals remains incomplete. In response to skeletal muscle damage, the systemic levels of IL-6 are elevated in MKP-5-deficient mice as compared with wild type mice, demonstrating that MKP-5 negatively regulates IL-6 production during muscle regeneration. Previous reports have demonstrated that IL-6 levels are negatively regulated by MKP-5 (29.Nonn L. Peng L. Feldman D. Peehl D.M.

In those cases, IL-6 expression levels were ascribed to the commensurate increase in IL-6 mRNA expression mainly in macrophages (30.Zhang Y. Blattman J.N. Kennedy N.J. Duong J. Nguyen T. Wang Y.

This key event during red blood cell development has been likened to an asymmetric cell division (ACD), by which the enucleating erythroblast divides into two very different daughter cells of alternate molecular composition, a nucleated cell that will be removed by associated macrophages, and the reticulocyte that will mature to the definitive erythrocyte. Here we investigated gene expression of members of the Par, Scribble and Pins/Gpsm2 asymmetric cell division complexes in erythroid cells, and functionally tested their role in erythroid enucleation in vivo and ex vivo. Despite their roles in regulating ACD in other contexts, we found that these polarity regulators are not essential for erythroid enucleation, nor for erythroid development in vivo. Together our results put into question a role for cell polarity and asymmetric cell division in erythroid enucleation."
