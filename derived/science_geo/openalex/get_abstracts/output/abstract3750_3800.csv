https://openalex.org/W2018080111,"Substance P produces analgesia when administered to mice in very small doses by the intraventricular route (1.25 to 5 nanograms per mouse). The analgesic effect can be blocked by naloxone. At higher doses (greater than 50 nanograms per mouse), this activity is lost. At these higher doses, however, substance P produced hyperalgesia when combined with naloxone and analgesia when combined with baclofen [β-(4-chlorophenyl)-gamma-aminobutyric acid]. Substance P may have dual actions in brain, releasing endorphins at very low doses and directly exciting neuronal activity in nociceptive pathways at higher doses."
https://openalex.org/W1578527572,"A soluble enzymically active cytochrome b.c1 complex has been purified from baker's yeast mitochondria by a procedure involving solubilization in cholate, differential fractionation with ammonium sulfate, and ultracentrifugation. The resulting particle is free of both cytochrome c oxidase and succinate dehydrogenase activities. The complex contains cytochromes b and c1 in a ratio of 2:1 and quinone and iron-sulfur protein in amounts roughly stoichiometric with cytochrome c1. EPR spectroscopy has shown the iron-sulfur protein to be present mainly as the Rieske protein. EPR spectroscopy also shows a heterogeneity in the cytochrome b population with resonances appearing at g = 3.60 (cytochrome bK) and g = 3.76 (cytochrome bT). A third EPR resonance appearing in the region associated with low spin ferric hemes (g = 3.49) is assigned to cytochrome c1. Anaerobic titration of the complex with dithionite confirmed the heterogeneity in the cytochrome b population and demonstrated that the oxidation-reduction potential of the iron-sulfur protein is approximately 30 mV more positive than cytochrome c1. An intense EPR signal assigned to the coenzyme Q free radical appeared midway in the reductive titration; this signal disappeared toward the end of the titration. A conformational change in the iron-sulfur protein attendant on reduction of a low potential species was noted."

https://openalex.org/W2042049668,"The opiate etorphine depresses monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP's) elicited in spinal cord cells by activation of dorsal root ganglion cells in murine neuronal cell culture. The depression is reversed by naloxone. Statistical analysis of the synaptic responses reveals that the opiate reduces EPSP quantal content at this synapse without altering quantal size. Therefore, the opiate action is presynaptic and affects transmitter release rather than postsynaptic responsiveness."

Enkephalin depressed glutamate-evoked responses in a noncompetitive manner independent of any other effects on membrane properties. The results demonstrate a neuromodulatory action of opiate peptide functionally distinct from the conventional neurotransmitter class of operation.

https://openalex.org/W2005737487,"Michigan dairy farm residents ate farm products containing polybrominated biphenyls (PBB's) after the accidental contamination of animal feed with the chemical in that state in 1973. The circulating blood lymphocytes of these residents show significant changes. Abnormalities include decreases in the numbers and percentages of peripheral blood lymphocytes that form rosettes with either sheep erythrocytes alone or with sheep erythrocytes sensitized with antibody and complement, increases in lymphocytes with no detectable surface markers (""null"" cells), and altered responses to tests designed to evaluate functional integrity of the cells. There appears to be no consistent correlation between the concentration of PBB's in the plasma and the altered lymphocytes. Studies showed that in Wisconsin dairy farm residents and healthy individuals in the New York area who were not exposed to PBB's there were no such abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W1978326641,"Sprouting of motor nerve terminals was evoked by functional denervation of skeletal muscles brought about by presynaptic blockade or disuse. The amount of sprouting, determined by morphometric measurement, was correlated with the level of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors. Sprouting was inhibited by blockade of acetylcholine receptors with alpha-bungarotoxin. Extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may play an important role in eliciting motor nerve terminal sprouting."
https://openalex.org/W2057060716,"Fasting decreases the ratio of hepatic nuclear to serum triiodothyronine (T3) by diminishing the binding capacity of nuclear T3 receptors. In combination with the lower serum T3 concentration caused by fasting, the decrease in receptor content results in a marked decrease in nuclear T3-receptor complexes. The changes in T3 receptor content and circulating T3 in fasted animals appear to be independent synergistic adaptations for caloric conservation in the fasted state. Unlike changes in hormonal level, the modification of nuclear receptor content provides a mechanism that may protect cells with a low caloric reserve independently of the metabolic status of the whole animal."
https://openalex.org/W1590988749,"Electrical shock treatment produces a rapid loss of high energy phosphates in rat brain. The [ATP]/[ADP] ratio decreases to one-third of its control value within 10 s. The ammonia content increases 3-fold during the first minute after starting the stimulus. The total adenine nucleotide plus adenosine content of brain decreases an equivalent amount of hypoxanthine-containing compounds appears. Adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine accumulate, and there is a transitory accumulation of adenylosuccinate. The contents of ATP and creatine phosphate, and the [ATP]/[ADP] ratio, are rapidly restored to control values, but other metabolite contents are restored more slowly. The transient rise in adenylosuccinate and IMP provides evidence that the ammonia production is due in part, and possibly in whole, to the operation of the purine nucleotide cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1991450017,Peripheral lymphocytes from human volunteers boosted with tetanus toxoid were cultured after in vitro infection with Epstein-Barr virus. Forty-four continuous lymphoblastoid lines were established which continued to secrete human gamma globulin; seven of these secreted antibody to tetanus toxoid. Subcultures derived from limiting dilution experiments continued to secrete the antibody. Some of these antibody-secreting cells have been in continuous culture for more than 6 months.

https://openalex.org/W1599605175,"Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and optical absorption spectroscopies have been used to monitor the concentrations of oxidized and reduced heme and copper during stoichiometric reductive titrations of purified beef heart cytochrome oxidase. The MCD data are deconvoluted to obtain the concentrations of reduced cytochromes a and a3 during the titrations; analysis of the EPR spectra provides complementary data on the concentrations of the EPR-detectable species. For the native enzyme in the absence of exogenous ligands, cytochromes a and a3 are reduced to approximately the same extent at all points in the titration. The reduction of the EPR-detectable copper, on the other hand, initially lags the reduction of the two cytochromes but in the final stages of the titration is completely reduced prior to either cytochrome a or a3. These non-Nernstian titration results are interpreted to indicate that the primary mode of heme-heme interaction in cytochrome oxidase involves shifts in oxidation-reduction potential for each of the two cytochromes such that a change in oxidation state for one of the hemes lowers the oxidation-reduction potential of the second heme by approximately 135 mV. In these titrations high spin species are detected which account for 0.25 spin/oxidase maximally. Evidence is presented to indicate that at least some of these signals can be attributed to cytochrome a3+ which has undergone a low-spin to high-spin state transition in the course of the titration. In the presence of carbon monoxide the oxidation-reduction properties of cytochromes a and a3 are markedly altered. The a32+. CO complex is fully formed prior to reduction of either cytochrome a3+ or the EPR-detectable copper. The g = 3 EPR signal attributed to cytochrome a3+ decreases as the MCD intensity of cytochrome a2+ increases; no significant high-spin intensity is observed at any intermediate stage of reduction. We interpret these Nernstian titration results to indicate that in the presence of ligands the oxidation-reduction potential of cytochrome a relative to cytochrome a3 is determined by the oxidation-reduction state of the stabilized cytochrome a3 ligand complex; if ligand binding occurs to reduced cytochrome a3 then cytochrome a titrates with a lower potential; cytochrome a titrates with a higher potential if oxidized cytochrome a3 is stabilized by ligand binding."

Pancreatectomy and streptozotocin diabetes the gonadotropin receptors and the administration of insulin restored the binding capacity to normal values. No differences in the association constant as well as the sedimentation coefficients of the luteinizing hormone-human chorionic gonadotropin receptor complexes were observed between normal and diabetic animals.

https://openalex.org/W2336425259,"Phosphoglycolate phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.18) was purified 1500-fold from field-grown tobacco leaves by acetone fractionation, DEAE-cellulose and molecular sieve chromatography, and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Preparations were judged 90 to 95% homogeneous by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and by isoelectric focusing. The highest specific activity obtained was 468 umol of phosphate released/min/ mg of protein. The native protein has a molecular weight of 80,500 by Ferguson plot analysis and 86,300 by sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels gave a molecular weight of 20,700, indicating that P-glycolate phosphatase is a tetramer with identical or near identical subunits. The enzyme, freshly purified or in crude homogenates, had a pi of 3.8 to 3.9 pH units by isoelectric focusing. Phosphoglycolate phosphatase from spinach leaves has a molecular weight of 93,000 and, unlike the enzyme from tobacco leaves, it is extremely unstable after DEAE-cellulose chromatography and is inactivated by lipase (EC 3.1.1.3). The phosphatase from both plants was stabilized by the addition of citrate or isocitrate in the buffers. Ribose 5-phosphate is a competitive inhibitor of phosphoglycolate phosphatase at physiological concentrations, while other phosphate esters of the photosynthetic carbon cycle were without effect."

In both strains, the virus-inducing loci are on chromosome 1, linked to the Dip-1/isozyme locus, but the two may not be at allelic sites."
https://openalex.org/W1542630845,"Abstract A phosphodiesterase activity that preferentially hydrolyzed cytidine 3':5'-monophosphate was partially purified from rat liver extract. The enzyme was best activated by Fe2+ (5 to 10 mM). Mn2+ and Mg2+ were less effective, whereas Zn2+, Co2+, and Ca2+ were ineffective. It exhibited kinetics typical of a high Km phosphodiesterase, with a Km for cycli CMP of 2.4 mM. The enzyme, inhibited by theophylline and 1-methyl-3-isobutyl xanthine to much less extents than cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP phosphodiesterases, was found in all rat tissues examined, with highest levels seen in the liver, kidney, and intestine, and lowest levels found in the skeletal muscle, cerebellum, aorta, and blood cells. The enzyme levels in the regenerating liver were found to be about 40% lower than the control liver of rats; they were also 3 to 10 times lower in the fetal liver, lung, and heart than the corresponding adult tissues of guinea pigs. These findings suggest that depressed cyclic CMP phosphodiesterase may be in part related to cell proliferation, in line with reports that the regenerating liver has higher levels of cyclic CMP (Bloch, A. (1975) Adv. Cycli Nucleotide Res. 5, 331-338) and cytidylate cyclase (Cech, S. Y., and Ignarro, L.J. (1977) Science 198, 1063-1065)."

https://openalex.org/W1660005100,"Intact, viable ultransformed 3T3 and transformed SV101-3T3 cells were labeled with fatty acid spin labels and with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl in order to measure the fluidity properties of membrane lipids. Both cell types were grown in regular calf serum and in a lipid-depleted serum supplemented with either oleate or elaidate. The temperature dependence of the spectra obtained revealed inflections that correlate with the temperature below which agglutination with concanavalin A is inhibited, and another inflection that correlates with the temperature below which agglutination with wheat germ agglutinin is inhibited, suggesting that (a) the lipid phase(s) in the vicinity of the receptor(s) for these two lectins differ, and (b) a fluid membrane in the vicinity of the lectin receptor(s) is necessary for agglutination with either concanavalin A or wheat germ agglutinin. Studies with a partially characterized plasma membrane fraction suggest that the plasma membrane fluidity parameters closely resemble those of the intact cell. 3T3 and SV101-3T3 cells show virtually identical fluidity profiles by all of the tests we have applied."

This suggests that the opiate receptor, mediating the observed cellular depression, and those mediating analgesia are presumably the same."

https://openalex.org/W1981617533,"Cell-mediated and humoral immune responses against antigens associated with primate C-type oncoviruses were evaluated in humans by microcytotoxicity and radioimmunoprecipitation assays. Five of six women tested sequentially during pregnancy developed selective cell-mediated reactivity against baboon endogenous virus (BEV)--infected human fibroblasts. Responsiveness peaked during the second and third trimesters and corresponded temporally with elevated antibody levels to BEV antigens. Similar cell-mediated reactivity was not observed in nonpregnant individuals. Selective cell-mediated reactivity directed against cells infected with the simian sarcoma virus-simian sarcoma associated virus complex (SSV--SSAV) was observed in four of 20 healthy adults (three of 14 nonpregnant, one of six pregnant). These observations suggest that cell-mediated reactivity against primate C-type oncoviruses is occasionally detected in healthy nonpregnant adults, but that during pregnancy both cell-mediated and humoral reactivity against BEV may become selectively expressed."
https://openalex.org/W1490938706,"cCMP-specific phosphodiesterase activity was demonstrated in the 80 to 100% ammonium sulfate fraction obtained from disrupted leukemia L-1210 cells. The activity was linear with time (up to 60 min), was a function of protein concentration, and was markedly stimulated by Mg2+ and by ammonium sulfate. Under identical assay conditions, no significant hydrolysis of cAMP or cGMP was observed, although these cyclic nucleotides served as substrates for phosphodiesterase(s) present in all the fractions obtained by less than 80% ammonium sulfate saturation. This is the first demonstration of a cCMP-specific phosphodiesterase."

https://openalex.org/W2240615390,"3-Aminopicolinate, a metal-chelating agent and a hyperglycemic agent in the rat, permits FeS+ to increase the maximal velocity of purified rat liver cytosolic P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase greater than 3-fold and also enhances activation by Mn”+ when it is incubated with metal ion and the enzyme prior to assaying for activity in the forward or reverse direction. In the presence or absence of added metal ion, 3-aminopicolinate does not alter the Michaelis constant of the enzyme for oxalacetate or MgITP. In the absence of added divalent transition metal ions, it has no effect upon enzyme activity indicating that it is not activating by removal of an inhibitory metal from the enzyme. 3-Aminopicolinate also permits Fe2+ to activate the enzyme in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of inorganic phosphate. Maximal activation is sustained during 5 h of incubation. Thus, 3-aminopicolinate may serve as a model for ferroactivator, a naturally occurring protein which permits Fe2+ to activate the enzyme in uitro. Maximal activation of the enzyme is obtained by incubation with 100 FM or greater metal ion. The concentrations of Fe2+ and iVInY+ in the incubation mixture that activate the enzyme half-maximally (K,,.,) are 20 and 17 PM, respectively. The K,,., of 3aminopicolinate in the incubation mixture ranges between 20 and 50 PM and appears to increase with increasing concentration of Fe2+ or Mn’+. Quinolinate and 3-mercaptopicolinate have previously been reported to be moderately strong and strong inhibitors, respectively, of P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase. 3-Mercaptopicolinate is a more potent inhibitor of the enzyme when it has been incubated with Fez+ with or without 3-aminopicolinate than when it has been incubated with Mn’+ or not incubated with a metal ion. Quinolinate inhibits significantly only when the enzyme has been activated by Fe” and 3-aminopicolinate; it moderately enhances activation of the enzyme by Mn”+.

Preincubation with Na+ or addition of monensin markedly reduced phosphate accumulation. Na+-stimulated phosphate transport was not affected by addition of either dicarboxylic acids, antimycin A, or ouabain and persisted after addition of proton ionophores. The coupling of phosphate transport to Na+ gradients was pH-dependent, with maximal stimulation by Na+ below pH 7. These findings suggest that monovalent phosphate anion moves across the plasma membrane in co-transport with sodium ion."
https://openalex.org/W18392335,"Part of the soluble cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase activity of crude human lung tissue can be attributed to a thermosensitive (37 degrees) enzyme with a high apparent affinity for both adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) and guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP). The enzyme can be partially purified by DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. In the presence of 0.1 mM EDTA or ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), it is eluted from the column immediately before a cyclic GMP-specific phosphodiesterase, but in the presence of 0.2 mM Ca2+, the elution follows that of the cyclic GMP-specific enzyme. The two forms of the nonspecific phosphodiesterase activity are referred to as DEAD-Sephadex Fractions Ia and Ic, respectively. Their apparent molecular weights, recorded at gel filtration, vary with different preparations from 230,000 to 150,000. Occasionally, corresponding recordings for main peaks of activity also cluster round the values 120,000, 105,000, and 78,000. The enzymatic properties of Fractions Ia and Ic closely resemble each other. The enzyme activity is blocked by EDTA, partially inhibited in the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline, but only slightly affected by EGTA. The inhibitory effect of EDTA can be overcome by Mg2+ and Mn2+ and that of 1,10-phenanthroline, in part, by Zn2+; this cation in itself is inhibitory at millimolar concentrations. With submicromolar substrate concentrations, the activity of either fraction obeys linear kinetics displaying an apparent Km of approximately 0.4 micron for both substrates. Reciprocal inhibition experiments suggest that hydrolysis of both cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP is performed by the same active site. Examination of the activity using extended substrate concentration ranges indicates nonlinear kinetics; Hill plots of such data also show nonlinear curvature. The activity is inhibited by micromolar concentrations of inosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic IMP), 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, papervine, and some antiallergic agents. Theophylline and disodium cromoglycate are less potent inhibitors. Inhibition of activity by Lubrol PX follows a biphasic dose response curve. The activity of Fraction Ia can be enhanced 2- to 3-fold by a Ca2+-dependent activator prepared from lung tissue, whose action is counteracted by chlorpromazine, and by lysophosphatidylcholine. It is initially enhanced but subsequently decreased at exposure to trypsin. Fraction Ic is less prone to activation by these agents. The results indicate that the present activity represents an enzyme form that differs from three previously described phosphodiesterases of human lung tissue. It is apparently related to, but also shows distinct differences from the Ca2+-dependent enzyme(s) of brain and heart tissue."

The interaction of the cytochrome c derivatives with beef heart cytochrome c oxidase (ferrocytochrome c:oxygen oxidoreductase, EC 1.9.3.1) in the presence of ultrviolet light results in formation of a covalent complex between cytochrome c and the oxidase. Using the lysine 22 derivative, the polypeptide composition of the oxidase is not modified, nor is its catalytic activity, whereas with the lysine 13 derivative, the gel electrophoretic pattern is altered and the catalytic activity of the complex diminished. The data are consisten with a specfic covalent interaction of the lysine 13 derivative of cytochrome c with the polypeptide of molecular weight 23,700 (Subunit II) of cytochrome c oxidase."

https://openalex.org/W2404287499,"Enzymatic hydrolysis of phosphoglycolate proceeds through O-P bond cleavage as determined by reaction in H218O and analysis of the trimethylsilyl derivatives of the reaction products by mass spectrometry. No phosphate, hydroxyl, or carboxyl exchange occurred. End product inhibition was consistent with an ordered release of products, first the alcoholic product, glycolate, then phosphate. Analysis of the data indicated that the phosphate.enzyme complex dissociated very rapidly, and this was confirmed by use of alternative phosphomonoester substrates. Maximum velocity with these alternate substrates was found to be proportional to the pKa of of the corresponding alcoholic product, indicating the rate-limiting step in the reaction was protonation of the bridge oxygen. The use of substrate analogs further suggested that enzymatic specificity residues in exacting steric requirements for binding, and that large alkyl groups were excluded on this basis. Phosphoglycolate phosphatase catalyzed transphorylation to a wide range of acceptors and was inhibited at the active site by diisopropyl-fluorophosphate. The data suggest that the reaction sequence proceeds via a phosphoenzyme intermediate. N-Ethylmaleimide slowly inactivated the enzyme, the rate being greatly increased by P-glycolate, but not by magnesium or phosphate ions. The data suggest a conformational change is necessary to induce the transition state complex and phosphoenzyme formation. This may account for the phosphate acceptor specificity and is consistent with the failure to observe an enzyme-mediated H2O-phosphate oxygen exchange."

A comparison of the rates of ketone body formation and the acetoacetatelfi-hydroxybutyrate ratio in isolated guinea pig and rat liver mitochondria in State 3 show that in the absence of added citric acid cycle anions, mitochondria from both species will synthesize predominantly acetoacetate. Rat liver mitochondria produced 4 times more total ketone bodies than guinea pig liver mitochondria. The addition of malate dramatically reduced the formation of ketone bodies by supplying oxalacetate for the subsequent synthesis of citrate by mitochondria from both species.

The results obtained are consistent with the existence of a dimer-tetramer equilibrium with the association constant of 2.6 X 10(7) M-1 (deltaG0 = -9.9 kcal/mol of dimer). The limiting partition cross-sections estimated by a three-parameter least squares minimization procedure indicate that the molecular radii of the dimer and tetramer are 53.8 A and 70 A, respectively. Both the dimeric and tetrameric forms of the enzyme possess dehydrogenase activity. Treatment of the enzyme with the chaotropic salts, potassium thiocyanate or potassium trichloroacetate, generates a monomeric form that is devoid of dehydrogenase activity.

The binding proteins detected had approximate molecular weights of 50,000, 36,000, and 10,000. Each of these components bound cyclic [3H]AMP with high affinity (apparent dissociation constants ranging from 2 to 10 nM) and had a similar ability to inhibit the purified catalytic subunit of rat liver protein kinase. Cyclic AMP prevented this inhibition in each instance. These results suggest that the binding site for cyclic AMP and the site for interacting with catalytic subunit occur relatively close to one another on the regulatory subunit and can remain functional when a substantial fraction of the subunit is lost."
