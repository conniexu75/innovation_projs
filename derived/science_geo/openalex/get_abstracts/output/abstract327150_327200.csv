https://openalex.org/W1980861884,A ruby-pulsed laser and high-sensitivity mass spectrometer are used to analyze isotopic abundances of rare gases from microgram samples of polished sections. The feasibility of the technique is demonstrated by the analysis of primordial helium and neon from the Kapoeta and Fayetteville meteorites.
https://openalex.org/W2086610203,"Data on river channel and sediment characteristics were collected at 36 cross sections of stable alluvial river channels in Australia and western United States. These data demonstrate that the meander wavelength of a river is dependent not only on water discharge, but also on the type of sediment load moved through the channel. The meander wavelength of rivers that are transporting a high proportion of their total sediment load as both sand and gravel will be greater than the meander wavelengths of channels of similar discharge which are transporting mainly fine sediment loads."
https://openalex.org/W1991831287,Populations of four species of the planktonic foraminiferal genus Globorotalia from sediments in the Gulf of Mexico show the effects of secondary thickening of the test. Quantitative tabulation of the distribution of thin- and thick-walled specimens illustrates an abrupt and separate depth at which the thickening takes place for each species.
https://openalex.org/W2029489032,"Some decametric radio emissions from Jupiter observed recently exhibit effects which are attributable to Faraday rotation within the earth's ionosphere. We present the evidence for the presence of Faraday rotation and discuss its origin. Identification of the magnetoionic mode in which the emission is generated at Jupiter appears possible, although near the limit of accuracy of our present observations. The emission seems to be generated in the extraordinary mode."
https://openalex.org/W2032807952,A parallel-bedded accumulation of sediments forms a low ridge on the upcurrent side of a partially moated knoll. These sediments were deposited beneath a southwestward-flowing current where it is locally decelerated by the obstructing knoll.

https://openalex.org/W2059381817,"Observations of the 3.4-millimeter radio emission from Mercury during 1965 and 1966 yielded the following relationship between average brightness temperature T(B) of the disk and the planetocentric phase angle i: T(B) = 277 (+/- 12) + 97 (+/- 17) cos [i + 29 deg (+/- 10 deg)] degrees K The errors are statistical standard; the phase shift corresponds to a phase lag-that is, the maximum and minimum of insolation lag the maximum and minimum of planetary radiation."

https://openalex.org/W1974135737,"The situation of graduate students in physics is profoundly influenced by federal support, which has been applied with mixed, and occasionally contradictory, purpose. There are five important goals in the provision of graduate student stipends: (i) maintenance of ""distinction for excellence""; (ii) rational distribution over scientific fields and subfields; (iii) constructive involvement of graduate students in undergraduate teaching; (iv) rational geographic and institutional distribution; and (v) administrative simplicity. These goals may be approached by making several adjustments of the present system. 1) The preeminence of individual predoctoral fellowships should be restored. They should be awarded sparingly to at most five percent of the graduate student population. 2) The great majority of stipends should take the form of traineeships. They should be assigned to departments according to rational criteria. 3) Research assistantships should be continued at a reduced level. Their maintenance will protect research activities of specific public interest when necessary. 4) Teaching should be incorporated into the normal responsibilities of fellows, trainees, and research assistants. Teaching assistance should be regarded as a budgeting category and not as an identifying characteristic of a particular group of students."

https://openalex.org/W4211250799,"A questionnaire prepared and sent by Science to 2000 randomly selected members of the AAAS has produced returns that indicate substantial disagreement with the aims and priorities of the national space program. The questionnaire drew 1134 returns within 3 weeks of mailing, including 548 on which the Ph.D. was listed as the highest degree held. A total of 139 respondents answered ""yes"" to the question: ""Do you receive support directly or indirectly from the federal government in connection with space activities?""The questions and results are tabulated below according to percentage of total responses (""Total""), percentage of responses by Ph.D. holders (""Ph.D.""), and percentage of responses by those who indicated a connection with space activities (""Space""). All percentages have been rounded off."
