https://openalex.org/W3047065127,"Chemical reactions that reliably join two molecular fragments together (cross-couplings) are essential to the discovery and manufacture of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals1,2. The introduction of amines onto functionalized aromatics at specific and pre-determined positions (ortho versus meta versus para) is currently achievable only in transition-metal-catalysed processes and requires halogen- or boron-containing substrates3,4,5,6. The introduction of these groups around the aromatic unit is dictated by the intrinsic reactivity profile of the method (electrophilic halogenation or C–H borylation) so selective targeting of all positions is often not possible. Here we report a non-canonical cross-coupling approach for the construction of anilines, exploiting saturated cyclohexanones as aryl electrophile surrogates. Condensation between amines and carbonyls, a process that frequently occurs in nature and is often used by (bio-)organic chemists7, enables a predetermined and site-selective carbon–nitrogen (C–N) bond formation, while a photoredox- and cobalt-based catalytic system progressively desaturates the cyclohexene ring en route to the aniline. Given that functionalized cyclohexanones are readily accessible with complete regiocontrol using the well established carbonyl reactivity, this approach bypasses some of the frequent selectivity issues of aromatic chemistry. We demonstrate the utility of this C–N coupling protocol by preparing commercial medicines and by the late-stage amination–aromatization of natural products, steroids and terpene feedstocks."
https://openalex.org/W3047501190,"White dwarfs represent the final state of evolution for most stars1–3. Certain classes of white dwarfs pulsate4,5, leading to observable brightness variations, and analysis of these variations with theoretical stellar models probes their internal structure. Modelling of these pulsating stars provides stringent tests of white dwarf models and a detailed picture of the outcome of the late stages of stellar evolution6. However, the high-energy-density states that exist in white dwarfs are extremely difficult to reach and to measure in the laboratory, so theoretical predictions are largely untested at these conditions. Here we report measurements of the relationship between pressure and density along the principal shock Hugoniot (equations describing the state of the sample material before and after the passage of the shock derived from conservation laws) of hydrocarbon to within five per cent. The observed maximum compressibility is consistent with theoretical models that include detailed electronic structure. This is relevant for the equation of state of matter at pressures ranging from 100 million to 450 million atmospheres, where the understanding of white dwarf physics is sensitive to the equation of state and where models differ considerably. The measurements test these equation-of-state relations that are used in the modelling of white dwarfs and inertial confinement fusion experiments7,8, and we predict an increase in compressibility due to ionization of the inner-core orbitals of carbon. We also find that a detailed treatment of the electronic structure and the electron degeneracy pressure is required to capture the measured shape of the pressure–density evolution for hydrocarbon before peak compression. Our results illuminate the equation of state of the white dwarf envelope (the region surrounding the stellar core that contains partially ionized and partially degenerate non-ideal plasmas), which is a weak link in the constitutive physics informing the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars9. Researchers have measured the equation of state of hydrocarbon in a high-density regime, which is necessary for accurate modelling of the oscillations of white dwarf stars."
https://openalex.org/W3047869610,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly spreading global pandemic. The clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been reported; however, there is limited research investigating the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 in the Middle East. This study aims to investigate the clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of patients diagnosed with COVID19 in Saudi Arabia. Methods This study is a retrospective single-centre case series study. We extracted data for patients who were admitted to the Al-Noor Specialist Hospital with a PCR confirming SARS-COV-2 between 12th and 31st of March 2020. Descriptive statistics were used to describe patients’ characteristics. Continuous data were reported as mean ± SD. Chi-squared test/Fisher test were used as appropriate to compare proportions for categorical variables. Results A total of 150 patients were hospitalised for COVID-19 during the study period. The mean age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.3 years). The most common comorbidities were hypertension (28.8%, n = 42) and diabetes mellitus (26.0%, n = 38). Regarding the severity of the hospitalised patients, 105 patients (70.0%) were mild, 29 (19.3%) were moderate, and 16 patients (10.7%) were severe or required ICU care. Conclusion This case series provides clinical, radiological and therapeutic characteristics of hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia."
https://openalex.org/W3048225747,"We conducted an internet survey using Survey Monkey over six weeks to evaluate the impact of the government interventions on social contact patterns in Luxembourg. Participants were recruited via the science.lu website on March 25, April 2, April 16, May 1 during lockdown, and June 12 and June 25 after the lockdown to provide an estimate of their number of contacts within the previous 24 hours. During the lockdown, a total of 5,644 survey participants with a mean age of 44.2 years reported 18,118 contacts (mean = 3.2, IQR 1–4). The average number of contacts per day increased by 24% from 2.9 to 3.6 over the lockdown period. The average number of contacts decreased with age: 4.2 (IQR 2–5) for participants below 25 years and 1.7 (IQR 1–2) for participants above 64 years. Residents of Portuguese nationality reported a higher number of contacts (mean = 4.3, IQR 2–5) than Luxembourgish (mean = 3.5, IQR 2–4) or other foreign residents, respectively. After lockdown, 1,119 participants reported 7,974 contacts with 7.1 (IQR 3–9) contacts per day on average, of which 61.7% (4,917/7,974) occurred without a facemask (mean = 4.9, IQR 2–6). While the number of social contacts was substantially lower during the lockdown by more than 80% compared to the pre-pandemic period, we observed a more recent 121% increase during the post lockdown period showing an increased potential for COVID-19 spread. Monitoring social contacts is an important indicator to estimate the possible impact of government interventions on social contacts and the COVID-19 spread in the coming months."
https://openalex.org/W3047162819,"The study aims were to describe positional differences in the acceleration and sprint profiles of professional football players in match-play, and analyse start speeds required based on the intensity of accelerations and decelerations. This longitudinal study was conducted over thirteen competitive microcycles in a professional football team from LaLiga 123. Data were collected through electronic performance tracking systems. Every player was categorised based on the playing position: central defender (CD), full-back (FB), forward (FW), midfielder (MF), and wide midfielder (WMF). In respect of acceleration profile, positional differences were found for all variables (p < 0.05), except average magnitude of accelerations (ACCAVG, p = 0.56) and decelerations (DECAVG, p = 0.76). The sprint profile also showed positional differences for all variables (p < 0.05), apart from sprint duration (p = 0.07). In addition, although low-intensity accelerations required significantly greater start speeds (Vo) than high-intensity accelerations in WMF (0.4 ± 0.2 km/h; p < 0.05) and FW (0.4 ± 0.2 km/h; p < 0.05), no significant differences (p > 0.05) were found in CD, FB, and MF. However, high-intensity decelerations were performed at significantly higher Vo than low-intensity decelerations in MF (2.65 ± 0.1 km/h; p < 0.05), FW (3.3 ± 0.1 km/h; p < 0.05), FB (3.9 ± 0.4 km/h; p < 0.05), WMF (4.3 ± 0.3 km/h; p < 0.05), and CD (4.1 ± 0.7 km/h; p < 0.05). Therefore, positional differences exist for most variables of the acceleration and sprint profiles. In addition, different Vo were observed between high-intensity and low-intensity accelerations as well as high-intensity and low-intensity decelerations."
https://openalex.org/W3047644145,"The rapid spread of the coronavirus and the strategies to slow it have disrupted just about every aspect of our lives. Such disruption may be reflected in changes in psychological function. The present study used a pre-posttest design to test whether Five Factor Model personality traits changed with the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Participants (N = 2,137) were tested in early February 2020 and again during the President’s 15 Days to Slow the Spread guidelines. In contrast to the preregistered hypotheses, Neuroticism decreased across these six weeks, particularly the facets of Anxiety and Depression, and Conscientiousness did not change. Interestingly, there was some evidence that the rapid changes in the social context had changed the meaning of an item. Specifically, an item about going to work despite being sick was a good indicator of conscientiousness before COVID-19, but the interpretation of it changed with the pandemic. In sum, the unexpected small decline in Neuroticism suggests that, during the acute phase of the coronavirus outbreak, feelings of anxiety and distress may be attributed more to the pandemic than to one’s personality."
https://openalex.org/W3048211190,"Mobile phone use is increasing in Sub-Saharan Africa, spurring a growing focus on mobile phones as tools to increase agricultural yields and incomes on smallholder farms. However, the research to date on this topic is mixed, with studies finding both positive and neutral associations between phones and yields. In this paper we examine perceptions about the impacts of mobile phones on agricultural productivity, and the relationships between mobile phone use and agricultural yield. We do so by fitting multilevel statistical models to data from farmer-phone owners (n = 179) in 4 rural communities in Tanzania, controlling for site and demographic factors. Results show a positive association between mobile phone use for agricultural activities and reported maize yields. Further, many farmers report that mobile phone use increases agricultural profits (67% of respondents) and decreases the costs (50%) and time investments (47%) of farming. Our findings suggest that there are opportunities to target policy interventions at increasing phone use for agricultural activities in ways that facilitate access to timely, actionable information to support farmer decision making."
https://openalex.org/W3048106528,"Recent outbreaks of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has led a global pandemic cross the world. Most countries took two main interventions: suppression like immediate lockdown cities at epicenter or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both strategies have their apparent merits and limitations; it becomes extremely hard to conduct one intervention as the most feasible way to all countries. Targeting at this problem, this paper conducted a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR, it extended traditional SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model by adding two key features: a direct connection between Exposed and Recovered populations, and separating infections into mild and critical cases. It defined parameters to classify two stages of COVID-19 control: active contain by isolation of cases and contacts, passive contain by suppression or mitigation. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan and London during January 2020 and March 2020. The simulated results showed that 1) Immediate suppression taken in Wuhan significantly reduced the total exposed and infectious populations, but it has to be consistently maintained at least 90 days (by the middle of April 2020). Without taking this intervention, we predict the number of infections would have been 73 folders higher by the middle of April 2020. Its success requires efficient government initiatives and effective collaborative governance for mobilizing of corporate resources to provide essential goods. This mode may be not suitable to other countries without efficient collaborative governance and sufficient health resources. 2) In London, it is possible to take a hybrid intervention of suppression and mitigation for every 2 or 3 weeks over a longer period to balance the total infections and economic loss. While the total infectious populations in this scenario would be possibly 2 times than the one taking suppression, economic loss and recovery of London would be less affected. 3) Both in Wuhan and London cases, one important issue of fitting practical data was that there were a portion (probably 62.9% in Wuhan) of self-recovered populations that were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic. This finding has been recently confirmed by other studies that the seroprevalence in Wuhan varied between 3.2% and 3.8% in different sub-regions. It highlights that the epidemic is far from coming to an end by means of herd immunity. Early release of intervention intensity potentially increased a risk of the second outbreak."
https://openalex.org/W3048167751,"Background To avoid a surge of demand on the healthcare system due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we must reduce transmission to individuals with chronic conditions who are at risk of severe illness with COVID-19. We aimed at understanding the perceptions, context and attitudes of individuals with chronic conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic to clarify their potential risk of infection. Methods A cross-sectional survey was nested in ComPaRe, an e-cohort of adults with chronic conditions, in France. It assessed participants’ perception of their risk of severe illness with COVID-19; their context (i.e., work, household, contacts with external people); and their attitudes in situations involving frequent or occasional contacts with symptomatic or asymptomatic people. Data were collected from March 23 to April 2, 2020, during the lockdown in France. Analyses were weighted to represent the demographic characteristics of French patients with chronic conditions. The subgroup of participants at high risk according to the recommendations of the French High Council for Public Health was examined. Results Among the 7169 recruited participants, 63% patients felt at risk because of severe illness. About one quarter (23.7%) were at risk of infection because they worked outside home, had a household member working outside home or had regular visits from external contacts. Less than 20% participants refused contact with symptomatic people and <20% used masks when in contact with asymptomatic people. Among patients considered at high risk according to the recommendations of the French High Council for Public Health, 20% did not feel at risk, which led to incautious attitudes. Conclusion Individuals with chronic conditions have distorted perceptions of their risk of severe illness with COVID-19. In addition, they are exposed to COVID-19 due to their context or attitudes."
https://openalex.org/W3047799610,"Salix matsudana, a member of Salicaceae, is an important ornamental tree in China. Because of its capability to tolerate high salt conditions, S. matsudana also plays an important ecological role when grown along Chinese coastal beaches, where the salinity content is high. Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism of higher salt tolerance in S. matsudana variety ‘9901’ by identifying the associated genes through RNA sequencing and comparing differential gene expression between the S. matsudana salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive samples treated with 150 mM NaCl. Transcriptomic comparison of the roots of the two samples revealed 2174 and 3159 genes responsive to salt stress in salt-sensitive and salt-tolerant sample, respectively. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of 9 of the responsive genes revealed a strong, positive correlation with RNA sequencing data. The genes were enriched in several pathways, including carbon metabolism pathway, plant-pathogen interaction pathway, and plant hormone signal transduction pathway. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) encoding transcription factors associated with abiotic stress responses and salt stress response network were identified; their expression levels differed between the two samples in response to salt stress. Hub genes were also revealed by weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) analysis. For functional analysis of the DEG encoding sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase), the gene was overexpressed in transgenic Arabidopsis, resulting in increased photosynthetic rates, sucrose and starch accumulation, and enhanced salt tolerance. Further functional characterization of other hub DEGs will reveal the molecular mechanism of salt tolerance in S. matsudana and allow the application of S. matsudana in coastal afforestation."
https://openalex.org/W3047860132,"Background Obesity is a major health problem in low and middle income countries (LMICs) and is associated with miscarriage. This study aims to examine the association between obesity and miscarriage among reproductive age women (15–49 years) in Nepal. Methods The combined 19160 cross-sectional pregnancy data from the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) for the years 2001, 2006, 2011 and 2016 was utilized. Miscarriage was defined as a spontaneous loss of pregnancy that occurred before the foetus reached 7 months of gestational age. Logistic regression analyses that adjusted for clustering, stratification and sampling weights were used to examine the association between obesity and miscarriage among women of reproductive age. Results The odds of miscarriage were 1.45 times higher (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.45; 95%Cl: 1.06, 1.98, P = 0.021) among women with obesity. Women who did not use contraception, younger (15–19 years), and older women (35 years or more) were significantly more likely to have miscarriage. Women who smoked tobacco reported higher odds of miscarriage than women who did not smoke tobacco (AOR = 1.27; 95%Cl: 1.07,1.50, P = 0.006). Stratification of maternal smoking status by maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), after adjusting for contraception, mother age and year of survey revealed that tobacco smoking and obesity are associated with miscarriage (AOR = 1.46; 95%Cl: 1.05,2.04, P = 0.025). Conclusions Findings from this study show that obesity and tobacco smoking are associated with miscarriage. Smoking cessation, pregnancy planning and counselling on healthy weight for women of reproductive age in Nepal may help promote healthy behaviours and decrease the likelihood of miscarriage."
https://openalex.org/W3048055966,"Renewable electricity can fully decarbonise the European electricity supply, but large land requirements may cause land-use conflicts. Using a dynamic model that captures renewable fluctuations, I explore the relationship between land requirements and total system cost of different supply-side options in the future. Cost-minimal fully renewable electricity requires some 97,000 km2 (2% of total) land for solar and wind power installations, roughly the size of Portugal, and includes large shares of onshore wind. Replacing onshore wind with offshore wind, utility-scale PV, or rooftop PV reduces land requirements drastically with only small cost penalties. Moving wind power offshore is most cost-effective and reduces land requirements by 50% for a cost penalty of only 5%. Wind power can alternatively be replaced by photovoltaics, leading to a cost penalty of 10% for the same effect. My research shows that fully renewable electricity supply can be designed with very different physical appearances and impacts on landscapes and the population, but at similar cost."
https://openalex.org/W3047983481,"Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, are highly ramified and motile and their morphology is strongly linked to their function. Microglia constantly monitor the brain parenchyma and are crucial for maintaining brain homeostasis and fine-tuning neuronal networks. Besides affecting neurons, anesthetics may have wide-ranging effects mediated by non-neuronal cells and in particular microglia. We thus examined the effect of two commonly used anesthetic agents, ketamine/xylazine and barbiturates, on microglial motility and morphology. A combination of two-photon in vivo imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings in unanesthetized and anesthetized mice as well as automated analysis of ex vivo sections were used to assess morphology and dynamics of microglia. We found that administration of ketamine/xylazine and pentobarbital anesthesia resulted in quite distinct EEG profiles. Both anesthetics reduced microglial motility, but only ketamine/xylazine administration led to reduction of microglial complexity in vivo. The change of cellular dynamics in vivo was associated with a region-dependent reduction of several features of microglial cells ex vivo, such as the complexity index and the ramification length, whereas thiopental altered the size of the cytoplasm. Our results show that anesthetics have considerable effects on neuronal activity and microglial morphodynamics and that barbiturates may be a preferred anesthetic agent for the study of microglial morphology. These findings will undoubtedly raise compelling questions about the functional relevance of anesthetics on microglial cells in neuronal physiology and anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity."

Existing protocols have relied on scientifically questionable evidence and might not lead to the optimal balance between public health safety and airlines' financial viability. Objective To explore the implementation feasibility of Thai Airways International protocol from the perspectives of passengers and aircrews. Design An online questionnaire survey of passengers and an in-depth interview with aircrews. Setting Two randomly selected repatriation flights operated by Thai Airways International using Boeing 777 aircraft (TG476 from Sydney and TG492 from Auckland to Bangkok) Participants 377 Thai passengers and 35 aircrews. Results The mean age of passengers was 28.14 (95%CI 26.72 to 29.55) years old; 57.03% were female. TG492 passengers were mostly students and significantly younger than that of TG476 (p<0.0001) with comparable flying experience (p = 0.1192). The average body temperature was 36.52 (95%CI 36.48 to 36.55) degrees Celsius. Passengers estimated average physical distances of 1.59 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.70), 1.41 (95%CI 1.29 to 1.53), and 1.26 (95%CI 1.12 to 1.41) meters at check-in, boarding, and in-flight, respectively. Passengers were checked for body temperature during the flight 1.97 (95%CI 1.77 to 2.18) times on average which is significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p<0.0001). Passengers moved around or went to the toilet during the flight 2.00 (95%CI 1.63 to 2.37) and 2.08 (95%CI 1.73 to 2.43) times which are significantly more frequent in longer than shorter flight (p = 0.0186 and 0.0049, respectively). The aircrews were satisfied with the protocol and provided several practical suggestions. Conclusion The protocol was well received by the passengers and aircrews of the repatriation flights with some suggestions for improvement."
https://openalex.org/W3047269802,"Maternal anemia is a worldwide public health problem especially in developing countries including Ethiopia. The burden of anemia among lactating mothers in Ethiopia was higher than those who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. To date, there is limited evidence on spatiotemporal patterns of anemia among lactating mothers in the country. Exploring the spatial patterns of maternal anemia is vital to design and monitor effective intervention programs. Therefore this study aimed to explore spatiotemporal patterns of anemia among lactating mothers in Ethiopia over the past one and half-decades.A total of 11,989 lactating mothers were included from the three consecutive Ethiopian Demographic and Health Surveys(2005, 2011, and 2016). The trend of anemia over the three surveys was showed. Furthermore, spatial autocorrelation analysis, cluster and outlier analysis, hotspot analysis, spatial interpolation, and spatial scan statistics were carried out to identify geographically risk areas of anemia among lactating mothers in Ethiopia. Finally, the most anemia risk areas were detected consistently by different spatial analytic methods in each survey.Anemia during lactation had an increasing trend from 2011 to 2016 in all regions of Ethiopia. It was also spatially clustered over three survey periods (Moran's I: 0.102-0.256, P<0.01).The hotspot areas were detected in Afar, Somali, Gambela, Dire Dawa, and Oromia regions during the last fifteen years. In 2005 and 2011, a total of 100 most likely clusters (Loglikelihood Ratio(LLR) = 8.8, P<0.05, and LLR = 45.94, P<0.001, respectively) were identified in the Afar region. However, in the 2016 survey period, primary clusters were shifted to the Somali region where 57 clusters (LLR = 72.73, P<0.001) were detected in the entire region. Besides, the risk prediction map showed that the eastern part of the country was at a higher risk of anemia during lactation.Anemia during lactation was spatially clustered in Ethiopia. High-risk areas were detected in the eastern part of Ethiopia prominently in the Afar and Somali regions. Therefore, public health intervention activities designed in a targeted approach to impact high-risk populations in those hot spot areas wound be helpful to reduce anemia in Ethiopia."
https://openalex.org/W3047718409,"Nipponites is a heteromorph ammonoid with a complex and unique morphology that obscures its mode of life and ethology. The seemingly aberrant shell of this Late Cretaceous nostoceratid seems deleterious. However, hydrostatic simulations suggest that this morphology confers several advantages for exploiting a quasi-planktic mode of life. Virtual, 3D models of Nipponites mirabilis were used to compute various hydrostatic properties through 14 ontogenetic stages. At each stage, Nipponites had the capacity for neutral buoyancy and was not restricted to the seafloor. Throughout ontogeny, horizontally facing to upwardly facing soft body orientations were preferred at rest. These orientations were aided by the obliquity of the shell’s ribs, which denote former positions of the aperture that were tilted from the growth direction of the shell. Static orientations were somewhat fixed, inferred by stability values that are slightly higher than extant Nautilus. The initial open-whorled, planispiral phase is well suited to horizontal backwards movement with little rocking. Nipponites then deviated from this bilaterally symmetric coiling pattern with a series of alternating U-shaped bends in the shell. This modification allows for proficient rotation about the vertical axis, while possibly maintaining the option for horizontal backwards movement by redirecting its hyponome. These particular hydrostatic properties likely result in a tradeoff between hydrodynamic streamlining, suggesting that Nipponites assumed a low energy lifestyle of slowly pirouetting in search for planktic prey. Each computed hydrostatic property influences the others in some way, suggesting that Nipponites maintained a delicate hydrostatic balancing act throughout its ontogeny in order to facilitate this mode of life."
https://openalex.org/W3048294123,"Health is a critical factor for the generation of value by workers. Companies bear substantial costs associated with absenteeism and presenteeism among their employees. This study investigates the impact of the environmental conditions in the workplace on the health and job satisfaction of employees, as core factors of productivity. We provide evidence based on a natural experiment, in which 70% of the workforce of a municipality in the Netherlands was relocated to a building with a design focused on sustainability and health and well-being. We construct a longitudinal dataset based on individual surveys of the entire municipality workforce and include measures before and after the move. The estimation results show a significant improvement in the perceived environmental conditions, as well as in the health and well-being of the relocated workers, measured by the drop in incidence of sick building syndrome symptoms. Results are heterogeneous based on age: older groups of employees enjoy larger health impacts. The relocation effects remain persistent in the medium term (two years after the moving date). Importantly, a mediation analysis suggests that the achieved improvements in health and well-being lead to significantly enhanced job satisfaction and a 2% reduction in the prevalence of sick leave."
https://openalex.org/W3047467811,"LEA3 proteins, a family of abiotic stress proteins, are defined by the presence of a tryptophan-containing motif, which we name the W-motif. We use Pfam LEA3 sequences to search the Phytozome database to create a W-motif definition and a LEA3 sequence dataset. A comprehensive analysis of these sequences revealed four N-terminal motifs, as well as two previously undiscovered C-terminal motifs that contain conserved acidic and hydrophobic residues. The general architecture of the LEA3 sequences consisted of an N-terminal motif with a potential mitochondrial transport signal and the twin-arginine motif cut-site, followed by a W-motif and often a C-terminal motif. Analysis of species distribution of the motifs showed that one architecture was found exclusively in Commelinids, while two were distributed fairly evenly over all species. The physiochemical properties of the different architectures showed clustering in a relatively narrow range compared to the previously studied dehydrins. The evolutionary analysis revealed that the different sequences grouped into clades based on architecture, and that there appear to be at least two distinct groups of LEA3 proteins based on their architectures and physiochemical properties. The presence of LEA3 proteins in non-vascular plants but their absence in algae suggests that LEA3 may have arisen in the evolution of land plants."
https://openalex.org/W3048278684,"Ants (Formicidae) present considerable diversity in chromosome numbers, which vary from n = 1 to n = 60, although this variation is not proportional to that in genome size, for which estimates range from 0.18 pg to 0.77 pg. Intraspecific variation in the chromosome number and karyotype structure has been reported among species, although the variation among populations of the same species has received much less attention, and there are few data on genome size. Here, we studied the karyotype length and genome size of different populations of the fungus-farming ants Mycetophylax conformis (Mayr, 1884) and Mycetophylax morschi (Emery, 1888). We also provide remarks on procedure for the estimation of ant genome size by Flow Cytometry (FCM) analysis. Chromosome number and morphology did not vary among the populations of M. conformis or the cytotypes of M. morschi, but karyotype length and genome size were significantly distinct among the populations of these ants. Our results on the variation in karyotype length and genome size among M. morschi and M. conformis populations reveal considerable diversity that would be largely overlooked by more traditional descriptions of karyotypes, which were also supported by the estimates of genome size obtained using flow cytometry. Changes in the amount of DNA reflect variation in the fine structure of the chromosomes, which may represent the first steps of karyotype evolution and may occur previously to any changes in the chromosome number."
https://openalex.org/W3048044947,"Introduction Unhealthy food environments drive the increase of diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Objective We aimed to examine healthy food environment policies in Kenya and identify priorities for future action. Methods Using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) we collected evidence on the extent of government action to create healthy food environments across 13 policy and infrastructure support domains and 43 related good practice indicators between 2017 and 2018. A panel of 15 national experts rated the extent of government action on each indicator compared to the policy development cycle and international best practice respectively. Based on gaps found, actions to improve food environments in Kenya were identified and prioritized. Results In the policy development cycle, 16/43 (37%) of good practice policy indicators were judged to be in ‘implementation’ phase, including: food composition targets, packaged foods’ ingredient lists/nutrient declarations; systems regulating health claims; restrictions on marketing breast milk substitutes; and school nutrition policies. Infrastructure support actions in ‘implementation’ phase included: food-based dietary guidelines; strong political support to reduce NCDs; comprehensive NCD action plan; transparency in developing food policies; and surveys monitoring nutritional status. Half (22/43) of the indicators were judged to be ‘in development’. Compared to international best practice, the Kenyan Government was judged to be performing relatively well (‘medium’ implementation) in one policy (restrictions on marketing breast milk substitutes) and three infrastructure support areas (political leadership; comprehensive implementation plan; and ensuring all food policies are sensitive to nutrition). Implementation for 36 (83.7%) indicators were rated as ‘low’ or ‘very little’. Taking into account importance and feasibility, seven actions within the areas of leadership, food composition, labelling, promotion, prices and health-in-all-policies were prioritized. Conclusion This baseline assessment is important in creating awareness to address gaps in food environment policy. Regular monitoring using Food-EPI may contribute to addressing the burden of diet-related NCDs in Kenya."
https://openalex.org/W3048203093,"We evaluated the between-cow (b-cow) variation and repeatability in omasal and milk fatty acids (FA) related to methane (CH4) emission. The dataset was originated from 9 studies with rumen-cannulated dairy cows conducted using either a switch-back or a Latin square design. Production of CH4 per mole of VFA (Y_CH4VFA) was calculated based on VFA stoichiometry. Experiment, diet within experiment, period within experiment, and cow within experiment were considered as random factors. Empirical models were developed between the variables of interest by univariate and bivariate mixed model regression analysis. The variation associated with diet was higher than the b-cow variation with low repeatability (< 0.25) for milk odd- and branch-chain FA (OBCFA). Similarly, for de novo synthesized milk FA, diet variation was ~ 3-fold greater than the b-cow variation; repeatability for these FA was moderate to high (0.34-0.58). Also, for both cis-9 C18:1 and cis-9 cis-12 cis-15 C18:3 diet variation was more than double the b-cow variation, but repeatability was moderate. Among the de novo milk FA, C4:0 was positively related with stoichiometric Y_CH4VFA, while for OBCFA, anteiso C15:0 and C15:0 were negatively related with it. Notably, when analyzing the relationship between omasal FA and milk FA we observed positive intercept estimates for all the OBCFA, which may indicate endogenous post-ruminal synthesis of these FA, most likely in the mammary gland. For milk iso C13:0, iso C15:0, anteiso C15:0, and C15:0 were positively influenced by omasal proportion of their respective FA and by energy balance. In contrast, the concentration of milk C17:0, iso C18:0, C18:0, cis-11 C18:1, and cis-9 cis-12 cis-15 C18:3 were positively influenced by omasal proportion of their respective FA but negatively related to calculated energy balance. Our findings demonstrate that for most milk FA examined, a larger variation is attributed to diet than b-cow differences with low to moderate repeatability. While some milk FA were positively or negatively related with Y_CH4VFA, there was a pronounced effect of calculated energy balance on these estimates. Additionally, even though OBCFA have been indicated as markers of rumen function, our results suggest that endogenous synthesis of these FA may occur, which therefore, may limit the utilization of milk FA as a proxy for CH4 predictions for cows fed the same diet."
https://openalex.org/W3047971855,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a nonsulfated glycosaminoglycan that has been widely used for biomedical applications. Here, we have analyzed the effect of HA on the rescue of primary cells under stress as well as its potential to recover muscle atrophy and validated the developed model in vitro using primary muscle cells derived from rats. The potentials of different HAs were elucidated through comparative analyses using pharmaceutical grade a) high (HHA) and b) low molecular weight (LHA) hyaluronans, c) hybrid cooperative complexes (HCC) of HA in three experimental set-ups. The cells were characterized based on the expression of myogenin, a muscle-specific biomarker, and the proliferation was analyzed using Time-Lapse Video Microscopy (TLVM). Cell viability in response to H2O2 challenge was evaluated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, and the expression of the superoxide dismutase enzyme (SOD-2) was assessed by western blotting. Additionally, in order to establish an in vitro model of atrophy, muscle cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), along with hyaluronans. The expression of Atrogin, MuRF-1, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-kB), and Forkhead-box-(Fox)-O-3 (FoxO3a) was evaluated by western blotting to elucidate the molecular mechanism of atrophy. The results showed that HCC and HHA increased cell proliferation by 1.15 and 2.3 folds in comparison to un-treated cells (control), respectively. Moreover, both pre- and post-treatments of HAs restored the cell viability, and the SOD-2 expression was found to be reduced by 1.5 fold in HA-treated cells as compared to the stressed condition. Specifically in atrophic stressed cells, HCC revealed a noteworthy beneficial effect on the myogenic biomarkers indicating that it could be used as a promising platform for tissue regeneration with specific attention to muscle cell protection against stressful agents."
https://openalex.org/W3047443439,"In May 2010 the large white butterfly, Pieris brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), was discovered to have established in New Zealand. It is a Palearctic species that-due to its wide host plant range within the Brassicaceae-was regarded as a risk to New Zealand's native brassicas. New Zealand has 83 native species of Brassicaceae including 81 that are endemic, and many are threatened by both habitat loss and herbivory by other organisms. Initially a program was implemented to slow its spread, then an eradication attempt commenced in November 2012. The P. brassicae population was distributed over an area of approximately 100 km2 primarily in urban residential gardens. The eradication attempt involved promoting public engagement and reports of sightings, including offering a bounty for a two week period, systematically searching gardens for P. brassicae and its host plants, removing host plants, ground-based spraying of insecticide to kill eggs and larvae, searching for pupae, capturing adults with nets, and augmenting natural enemy populations. The attempt was supported by research that helped to progressively refine the eradication strategy and evaluate its performance. The last New Zealand detection of P. brassicae occurred on 16 December 2014, the eradication program ceased on 4 June 2016 and P. brassicae was officially declared eradicated from New Zealand on 22 November 2016, 6.5 years after it was first detected and 4 years after the eradication attempt commenced. This is the first species of butterfly ever to have been eradicated worldwide."
https://openalex.org/W3047729517,"To compare pain during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) following topical lidocaine jelly and sub-Tenon anesthesia versus peribulbar anesthesia.Prospective, single-center, randomized study. Patients scheduled for PPV for macular hole (MH) or epiretinal membrane (ERM) at the Retina and Vitreous Section of the Department of Ophthalmology, Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo were randomly assigned to one of two groups in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Patients assigned to Group ST received topical anesthesia with 2% lidocaine jelly followed by sub-Tenon anesthesia with 2-4 ml of 1% ropivacaine. Patients assigned to PB received peribulbar anesthesia with 4-6 ml of 1% ropivacaine. After PPV, patients in both groups were asked to rate the level of pain they felt during the entire procedure (including anesthesia administration and PPV) by pointing at a 0-100 Visual Analogue Pain Scale (VAS). Data regarding demographics, patient characteristics and surgical features were also collected.Fifty-four patients were enrolled in the study (26 in Group ST and 28 in Group PB). Baseline characteristics, including age, gender, and presence of comorbidities, were similar in both groups. The surgery performed was PPV alone in 10 and 14 patients in the ST and PB groups, respectively, and combined phacoemulsification and PPV in 16 and 14 patients in the ST and PB groups, respectively (p = 0.39, Pearson). Surgery duration (mean ± SD minutes) was similar in the two groups (62 ± 12 for ST and 70 ± 20 for PB, p = 0.09, t-Test). No patients needed supplemental topical or intravenous anesthesia during surgery. No sight- or life-threatening complication was observed in either group. VAS score was significantly lower in the ST compared to the PB group (median (interquartile range) was 1 (2.25-0) in the ST group compared to 11.5 (29.75-5) in the PB group, p< 0.0001, Wilcoxon).In this study of patients who underwent PPV for MH or ERM, topical followed by sub-Tenon anesthesia was more effective in controlling pain during the whole vitrectomy procedure than peribulbar anesthesia. Compared to peribulbar anesthesia which is administered with a sharp needle, sub-Tenon anesthesia administered with a blunt cannula may be associated with a reduced risk of such adverse events as globe perforation, retrobulbar hemorrhage, and inadvertent injection of anesthesia into the optic nerve sheath."
https://openalex.org/W3048050454,"The smalltail shark, Carcharhinus porosus, was the most abundant elasmobranch species in fisheries off Brazil’s northern coast (BNC) in the 1980s, but its population has been declining since the 1990s. For this reason, a demographic analysis is necessary to determine the extent of this decline and the fishing effect on the BNC’s population. Therefore, we performed a stochastic demographic analysis of the population in the BNC, and considered its global center of abundance. Smalltail shark specimens (n = 937) were collected with gillnets in Maranhão state, eastern BNC, in the 1980s with sizes ranging between 29.6 and 120.0 cm total length. Most of the individuals (90.6%) caught were juveniles (< 6 years-old), and the mortality and exploitation rates showed that the species was overexploited (92.3% above the fishing mortality corresponding to the population equilibrium threshold). The smalltail shark’s biological characteristics, such as slow growth and low fecundity, demonstrate that it is one of the least resilient species among similar sized coastal sharks in the region. All these factors yielded an annual decrease of 28% in the intrinsic population growth rate, resulting in a population decline of more than 90% in only 10 years, and much higher for the current period. This set of features comprising fishing recruitment occurring upon juveniles, overfishing, and intrinsically low resilience make the population unable to sustain fishing pressure and severely hamper biological recruitment, thus causing this drastic population decline. Furthermore, several local extinctions for this species in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil highlight its concerning conservation scenario. Therefore, since similar fisheries characteristics occur throughout its distribution range, C. porosus fits the criteria E of the IUCN Red List for a critically endangered species and urgent conservation measures are needed to prevent its extinction in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W3048270945,"Background This study aimed to investigate the correlation between primary tumor volume and cancer failure patterns in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated with definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) and examine whether increasing radiation dose can improve the outcome. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 124 patients with stage III ESCC treated by definitive CCRT. The primary tumor volume calculated from the radiotherapy planning computed tomography scans was correlated to treatment response, time to disease progression, and overall survival. We further analyzed whether a higher radiation dose correlated with better disease control and patient survival. Results Patients with poor CCRT response had a larger primary tumor volume than those with good response (97.9 vs 64.3 cm3, P = 0.032). The optimal cutoff value to predict CCRT response was 55.3 cm3. Large primary tumor volume (≥ 55.3 cm3) correlated with shorter time to tumor progression in the esophagus (13.6 vs 48.6 months, P = 0.033) compared with small tumor volume (< 55.3 cm3). For the large esophageal tumors (≥ 55.3 cm3), radiation dose > 60 gray significantly prolonged the time to tumor progression in esophagus (20.3 vs 10.1 months, P = 0.036) and overall survival (12.2 vs 8.0 months, P = 0.030), compared with dose ≤ 60 gray. In contrast, higher radiation dose did not benefit local disease control or overall survival in the small esophageal tumors (< 55.3 cm3). Conclusion Large primary tumor volume correlates with poor local control and overall survival in ESCC treated with definitive CCRT. Radiation dose > 60 gray can improve the outcomes in patients with large primary tumor. Further prospective dose escalation trials are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3048356761,"Nutritional status contributes to the regulation of immune responses against pathogens, and malnutrition has been considered as a risk factor for tuberculosis (TB). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB, can modulate host lipid metabolism and induce lipid accumulation in macrophages, where the bacilli adopt a dormant phenotype. In addition, serum lipid components play dual roles in the regulation of and protection from Mtb infection. We analyzed the relationship between nutritional status and the humoral immune response in TB patients. We found that serum HDL levels are positively correlated with the serum IgA specific for Mtb antigens. Analysis of the relationship between serum nutritional parameters and clinical parameters in TB patients showed that serum albumin and CRP levels were negatively correlated before treatment. We also observed reduced serum LDL levels in TB patients following treatment. These findings may provide insight into the role of serum lipids in host immune responses against Mtb infection. Furthermore, improving the nutritional status may enhance vaccination efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W3046972747,"Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV) is a ubiquitous human virus resident in a majority of the global population as a latent infection. Acyclovir (ACV), is the standard of care drug used to treat primary and recurrent infections, supplemented in some patients with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treatment to suppress infection and deleterious inflammatory responses. As many diverse medications have recently been shown to change composition of the gut microbiome, we used Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine the effects of ACV and IVIG on the gut bacterial community. We found that HSV, ACV and IVIG can all independently disrupt the gut bacterial community in a sex biased manner when given to uninfected C57BL/6 mice. Treatment of HSV infected mice with ACV or IVIG alone or together revealed complex interactions between these drugs and infection that caused pronounced sex biased dysbiosis. ACV reduced Bacteroidetes levels in male but not female mice, while levels of the Anti-inflammatory Clostridia (AIC) were reduced in female but not male mice, which is significant as these taxa are associated with protection against the development of graft versus host disease (GVHD) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) patients. Gut barrier dysfunction is associated with GVHD in HSCT patients and ACV also decreased Akkermansia muciniphila, which is important for maintaining gut barrier functionality. Cumulatively, our data suggest that long-term prophylactic ACV treatment of HSCT patients may contribute to GVHD and also potentially impact immune reconstitution. These data have important implications for other clinical settings, including HSV eye disease and genital infections, where ACV is given long-term."

However, it remains unclear whether serum antibody titers for a specific periodontal pathogen are associated with outcome after ischemic stroke, and which kinds of pathogens are associated with ischemic stroke. We examined the relationship between serum IgG titers to periodontal pathogens and outcome in ischemic stroke patients. A total of 445 patients with acute ischemic stroke (194 female [44.0%], mean age 71.9±12.3 years) were registered in this study. Serum IgG titers to 9 periodontal pathogens (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Treponema denticola, Tannerella forsythensis, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens) were evaluated using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. An unfavorable outcome was defined as a 3 or higher on the modified Rankin Scale. The proportion of patients with unfavorable outcome was 25.4% (113 patients). Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, numbers of IgG antibodies positive for periodontal pathogens (odds ratio 1.20, 95% CI 1.02-1.41, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of unfavorable outcome in ischemic stroke patients."

Results indicate that most variables in the central route affect backers' investment behavior positively, while most variables in the periphery route have a negative impact on backers' investment behavior. The Funding Status has a significant negative moderating effect on the explicit variables, and has no significant moderating effect on the implicit information variables of the project. In addition, we upgrade the econometric method used by previous scholars, which could improve the accuracy of the FE model. Furthermore, we find strong support for the herding effect in reward-based crowdfunding and the intensity tends to decrease before the funding goal draws near."
https://openalex.org/W3047665479,"To infer the parameters of mechanistic models with intractable likelihoods, techniques such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are increasingly being adopted. One of the main disadvantages of ABC in practical situations, however, is that parameter inference must generally rely on summary statistics of the data. This is particularly the case for problems involving high-dimensional data, such as biological imaging experiments. However, some summary statistics contain more information about parameters of interest than others, and it is not always clear how to weight their contributions within the ABC framework. We address this problem by developing an automatic, adaptive algorithm that chooses weights for each summary statistic. Our algorithm aims to maximize the distance between the prior and the approximate posterior by automatically adapting the weights within the ABC distance function. Computationally, we use a nearest neighbour estimator of the distance between distributions. We justify the algorithm theoretically based on properties of the nearest neighbour distance estimator. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we apply it to a variety of test problems, including several stochastic models of biochemical reaction networks, and a spatial model of diffusion, and compare our results with existing algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W3047744623,"Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is characterised in early stages by orbital fibroblast inflammation, which can be aggravated by oxidative stress and often leads to fibrosis. Protein tyrosine protein 1B (PTP1B) is a regulator of inflammation and a therapeutic target in diabetes. We investigated the role of PTP1B in the GO mechanism using orbital fibroblasts from GO and healthy non-GO subjects. After 24 hours of transfection with PTPN1 siRNA, the fibroblasts were exposed to interleukin (IL)-1β, cigarette smoke extract (CSE), H2O2, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β stimulations. Inflammatory cytokines and fibrosis-related proteins were analysed using western blotting and/or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) release was detected using an oxidant-sensitive fluorescent probe. IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, bovine thyroid stimulating hormone (bTSH), high-affinity human stimulatory monoclonal antibody of TSH receptor (M22), and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) significantly increased PTP1B protein production in GO and non-GO fibroblasts. PTPN1 silencing significantly blocked IL-1β-induced inflammatory cytokine production, CSE- and H2O2-induced ROS synthesis, and TGF-β-induced expression of collagen Iα, α-smooth muscle actin (SMA), and fibronectin in GO fibroblasts. Silencing PTPN1 also decreased phosphorylation levels of Akt, p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress response proteins in GO cells. PTP1B may be a potential therapeutic target of anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-fibrotic treatment of GO."
https://openalex.org/W3047960571,"Background An association between education and dementia is well-established but it is unclear whether education is associated with dementia after accounting for early life cognitive ability and whether there is a joint effect, such that the risk associated with one of the exposures depends on the value of the other. We examined separate and joint associations of adolescent cognitive ability and educational attainment with risk of dementia among Danish men born between 1939 and 1959. Methods Men (N = 477,421) from the Danish Conscription Database were followed for dementia from the age 60 for up to 17 years via patient and prescription registry linkages. Exposure measures included cognitive ability assessed at the conscript board examination around age 18 and highest educational level (low: 0–10 year, medium: 10–13 years, high: ≥13 years) at age 30 from registry records. Associations with dementia diagnosis were estimated in Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for birth year and age at conscript board examination. Interaction was assessed on the multiplicative scale by including a product term between the two exposure measures and on the additive scale by calculating relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) between different levels of the exposure measures. Results Compared to men in the high education group hazard ratio [HR] for men in the medium and low group were 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13, 1.30) and 1.34 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.45), respectively when not adjusting for cognitive ability. Additional adjustment for cognitive ability attenuated the magnitude of the associations, but they remained significant (education medium: HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.19 and education low: HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.22). A 10% higher cognitive ability score was associated with a 3.8% lower hazard of dementia (HR = 0.962; 95% CI: 0.957, 0.967), and the magnitude of the association only changed marginally after adjustment for education. Men in the low education group with relatively low cognitive ability were identified as a high-risk subgroup for dementia. The increased risk associated with exposure to both risk factors did, however, not significantly depart from the sum of risk experienced by men only exposed to one of the risk factors (estimates of RERI were not significantly different from 0) and no significant evidence of either additive or multiplicative interactions was found. Conclusions In conclusion, the results suggest that education and cognitive ability protect against the risk of dementia independently of one another and that increases in educational attainment may at least partially offset dementia risk due to low cognitive ability."
https://openalex.org/W3048091669,"Advancing age affects the recruitment of task related neural resources thereby changing the efficiency, capacity and use of compensatory processes. With advancing age, brain activity may therefore increase within a region or be reorganized to utilize different brain regions. The different brain regions may be exclusive to old adults or accessible to young and old alike, but non-optimal. Interference during verbal working memory information retention recruits parahippocampal brain regions in young adults similar to brain activity recruited by old adults in the absence of external interference. The current work tests the hypothesis that old adults recruit neural resources to combat increases in age-related intrinsic noise that young adults recruit during high levels of interference during information retention. This experiment administered a verbal delayed item recognition task with low and high levels of an interfering addition task during information maintenance. Despite strong age-related behavioral effects, brain imaging results demonstrated no significant interaction effects between age group and the interference or memory tasks. Significant effects were only found for the interaction between interference level and memory load within the inferior frontal cortex, supplementary motor cortex and posterior supramarginal regions. Results demonstrate that neural resources were shared when facing increasing memory load and interference. The combined cognitive demands resulted in brain activity reaching a neural capacity limit which was similar for both age groups and which brain activation did not increase above. Despite significant behavioral differences the neural capacity limited the detection of age group differences in brain activity."
https://openalex.org/W3048315440,"The Drosophila shaggy gene (sgg, GSK-3) encodes multiple protein isoforms with serine/threonine kinase activity and is a key player in diverse developmental signalling pathways. Currently it is unclear whether different Sgg proteoforms are similarly involved in signalling or if different proteoforms have distinct functions. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to tag eight different Sgg proteoform classes and determined their localization during embryonic development. We performed proteomic analysis of the two major proteoform classes and generated mutant lines for both of these for transcriptomic and phenotypic analysis. We uncovered distinct tissue-specific localization patterns for all of the tagged proteoforms we examined, most of which have not previously been characterised directly at the protein level, including one proteoform initiating with a non-standard codon. Collectively, this suggests complex developmentally regulated splicing of the sgg primary transcript. Further, affinity purification followed by mass spectrometric analyses indicate a different repertoire of interacting proteins for the two major proteoforms we examined, one with ubiquitous expression (Sgg-PB) and one with nervous system specific expression (Sgg-PA). Specific mutation of these proteoforms shows that Sgg-PB performs the well characterised maternal and zygotic segmentations functions of the sgg locus, while Sgg-PA mutants show adult lifespan and locomotor defects consistent with its nervous system localisation. Our findings provide new insights into the role of GSK-3 proteoforms and intriguing links with the GSK-3α and GSK-3β proteins encoded by independent vertebrate genes. Our analysis suggests that different proteoforms generated by alternative splicing are likely to perform distinct functions."

This study aimed to investigate the short-term effects of scapular muscle strengthening exercises with motor-control techniques on neck dissection-related shoulder dysfunction in oral cancer survivors before the initiation of radiotherapy.Thirty-eight participants were randomly allocated into the motor-control and regular-exercise groups. Each group received conventional physical therapy and specific scapular muscle strengthening exercises for 1 month immediately after neck dissection. Motor control techniques were integrated with scapular strengthening exercises for the motor-control group. Shoulder pain, active range of motion (AROM) of shoulder abduction, and scapular muscle activities including upper trapezius (UT), middle trapezius (MT), lower trapezius (LT), and serratus anterior (SA) when performing maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and scapular muscle exercises were evaluated at baseline and after 1 month of training.Both groups reduced shoulder pain and increased muscle activity of maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of each muscle after the intervention. Increased AROM of shoulder abduction was only observed in the motor-control group (95% CI 3.80 to 20.51, p = 0.004). Relative to baseline evaluation, muscle activities of UT decreased in the motor-control group when performing shoulder shrug with 1-kg weight (95% CI -33.06 to -1.29, p = 0.034). Moreover, the SA activity decreased in the motor-control group (95% CI -29.73 to -27.68, p<0.001) but increased in the regular-exercise group (95% CI 28.16 to 30.05, p<0.001) when performing shoulder horizontal adduction and flexion.Early strengthening exercise with motor control techniques has greater benefits for improving AROM of shoulder abduction, muscle economy, and reducing compensatory scapular muscle activities in patients with neck dissection-related shoulder dysfunction before the initiation of radiotherapy."

Alarmingly, there are increased reports of D. immitis isolates with resistance to macrocyclic lactones and the ability to break through prophylaxis. Yet, there is not a well-established laboratory assay that can utilize biochemical phenotypes of microfilariae to predict drug resistance status. In this study we evaluated laboratory assays measuring cell permeability, metabolism, and P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux. Our assays revealed that trypan blue, propidium iodide staining, and resazurin metabolism could detect differences among D. immitis isolates but none of these approaches could accurately predict drug susceptibility status for all resistant isolates tested. P-glycoprotein assays suggested that the repertoire of P-gp expression is likely to vary among isolates, and investigation of pharmacological differences among different P-gp genes is warranted. Further research is needed to investigate and optimize laboratory assays for D. immitis microfilariae, and caution should be applied when adapting cell death assays to drug screening studies for nematode parasites."
https://openalex.org/W3047993529,"Background and objectives The number of patients with pulmonary Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease is increasing worldwide, especially among middle-aged women and never-smokers. However, little is known about the factors causing exacerbations of pulmonary MAC disease in untreated patients. The aim of the present study was to identify the predictors of radiological aggravations of pulmonary MAC disease. Methods From April 2011 to December 2018, 238 MAC patients at our institute were newly diagnosed with pulmonary MAC disease according to the 2007 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Disease Society guideline. Their medical records were examined retrospectively for their clinical findings. The radiological findings at the time of the diagnosis and 1 year later were evaluated. To identify the predictors of radiological aggravation, multivariable analysis was performed with the data of 167 treatment-naïve patients. Results Female, never-smoker, and nodular/bronchiectatic (NB) type were predominant in patients with pulmonary MAC disease. Univariate analysis of data from treatment-naïve subjects showed that no lung diseases other than MAC, extensive radiological findings, and a positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear were significantly associated with radiological aggravations. On multivariate analysis, the radiological factor (larger affected area) and absence of other lung disease were significantly associated with radiological aggravations. In particular, the presence of abnormal shadows in more than 3 lobes was significantly associated with radiological aggravations. Conclusions In this study, the presence of extensive radiological findings and the absence of lung diseases other than MAC were predictors of radiological aggravations of treatment-naïve pulmonary MAC disease. In particular, the presence of abnormal shadows in more than 3 lobes was significantly associated with radiological aggravations."
https://openalex.org/W3048032493,"Crohn’s disease is a pathological condition of the gastro-intestinal tract, causing severe transmural inflammation in the ileum and/or colon. Cigarette smoking is one of the best known environmental risk factors for the development of Crohn’s disease. Nevertheless, very little is known about the effect of prolonged cigarette smoke exposure on inflammatory modulators in the gut. We examined the effect of cigarette smoke on cytokine profiles in the healthy and inflamed gut of human subjects and in the trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid mouse model, which mimics distal Crohn-like colitis. In addition, the effect of cigarette smoke on epithelial expression of transient receptor potential channels and their concurrent increase with cigarette smoke-augmented cytokine production was investigated. Active smoking was associated with increased IL-8 transcription in ileum of controls (p < 0,001; n = 18-20/group). In the ileum, TRPV1 mRNA levels were decreased in never smoking Crohn’s disease patients compared to healthy subjects (p <0,001; n = 20/group). In the colon, TRPV1 mRNA levels were decreased (p = 0,046) in smoking healthy controls (n = 20/group). Likewise, healthy mice chronically exposed to cigarette smoke (n = 10/group) showed elevated ileal Cxcl2 (p = 0,0075) and colonic Kc mRNA levels (p = 0,0186), whereas TRPV1 mRNA and protein levels were elevated in the ileum (p = 0,0315). Although cigarette smoke exposure prior to trinitrobenzene sulphonic acid administration did not alter disease activity, increased pro-inflammatory cytokine production was observed in the distal colon (Kc: p = 0,0273; Cxcl2: p = 0,104; Il1-β: p = 0,0796), in parallel with the increase of Trpv1 mRNA (p < 0,001). We infer that CS affects pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in healthy and inflamed gut, and that the simultaneous modulation of TRPV1 may point to a potential involvement of TRPV1 in cigarette smoke-induced production of inflammatory mediators."

We calculate performance measures, including peak prevalence and total attack rate, while accounting for clinic operations, including timing and location. We find that opening clinics can reduce disease spread and hospitalizations even when visited by the worried-well, open for limited weeks, or open in limited locations, and especially when the clinics are in operation during times of highest prevalence. Specifically, peak prevalence, total attack rate, and hospitalization reduced 0.07-0.32%, 0.40-1.51%, 0.02-0.09%, respectively, by operating clinics for the pandemic duration."

The males and females of five different species of Trichogramma namely, T. brassicae, T. chilotraeae, T. danaidiphaga, T. danausicida and T. dendrolimi were morphometrically analysed. A total of 33 characters in males and 27 in females were taken into consideration for morphometric identification and analysis using principal component method. It was observed that few characters of male like body length, length of flagellar hair, maximum marginal hair length of fore wing, genitalia characters including aedeagus length, distance between chelate structure and gonoforceps, and others were identified as important morphometric characters. Similarly, in females, ovipositor length, body and head length, eye width, antennal club width and number of setae in forewings were found important for taxonomic identification. Male and female of each species are clearly identified from high definition microscopic images."

To minimize this risk, we tested the effectiveness of medical-grade Manuka honey at treating intertrigo as compared to a placebo hydrogel. We additionally characterized the culturable microbial flora of intertrigo and recorded any adverse effect with either treatment. During this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, adaptive group-sequential trial, the owners washed the affected sites on their dog with water, dried and applied a thin film of either the honey or the placebo product once daily for 21 days. Cytological and lesional composite scores, owner-assessed pruritus, and microbial cultures were assessed prior to treatment and on Day-22. The fixed effects of time, treatment, and animal-related variables on the pruritus and on each composite score, accounting for random dog effect, were estimated separately with generalized linear mixed models for repeated count outcomes (α = 0.05). The null hypothesis of equal treatment effects was rejected at the first interim analysis. The placebo (n = 16 dogs) outperformed the medical honey (n = 13 dogs) at improving both the cytological score (Treatment×Time = -0.35±0.17; P = 0.04) and clinical score (Treatment×Time = -0.28±0.13; P = 0.04). A microbial burden score higher than 4 increased the severity of the cytological score (dichotomous score: 0.29±0.11; P = 0.01), which in turn increased the severity of the clinical score and pruritus score. For every unit increase in cytological score, the linear predictor of clinical score increased by 0.042±0.019 (P = 0.03), and the one of pruritus score increased by 0.12±0.05 (P = 0.01). However, medical honey outperformed the placebo at alleviating the dog's owner-assessed pruritus after statistically controlling for masking effects (Time = -0.94±0.24; P = 0.002; and Treatment×Time = 0.80±0.36; P = 0.04). Unilateral tests of the least-square mean estimates revealed that honey only significantly improved the pruritus (Hommel-adjusted P = 0.003), while the placebo only improved the cytological and clinical scores (Hommel-adjusted P = 0.01 and 0.002, respectively). Taken together, these results question the value of Manuka honey at treating nasal intertrigo in dogs."
https://openalex.org/W3047759331,"Otitis media, the most common disease of childhood, is characterized by extensive changes in the morphology of the middle ear cavity. This includes hyperplasia of the mucosa that lines the tympanic cavity, from a simple monolayer of squamous epithelium into a greatly thickened, respiratory-type mucosa. The processes that control this response, which is critical to otitis media pathogenesis and recovery, are incompletely understood. Given the central role of protein phosphorylation in most intracellular processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, we screened a library of kinase inhibitors targeting members of all the major families in the kinome for their ability to influence the growth of middle ear mucosal explants in vitro. Of the 160 inhibitors, 30 were found to inhibit mucosal growth, while two inhibitors enhanced tissue proliferation. The results suggest that the regulation of infection-mediated tissue growth in the ME mucosa involves multiple cellular processes that span the kinome. While some of the pathways and processes identified have been previously implicated in mucosa hyperplasia others are novel. The results were used to generate a global model of growth regulation by kinase pathways. The potential for therapeutic applications of the results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3047168245,"While the internet has democratized and accelerated content creation and sharing, it has also made people more vulnerable to manipulation and misinformation. Also, the received information can be distorted by psychological biases. This is problematic especially in health-related communications which can greatly affect the quality of life of individuals. We assembled and analyzed 364 texts related to nutrition and health from Finnish online sources, such as news, columns and blogs, and asked non-experts to subjectively evaluate the texts. Texts were rated for their trustworthiness, sentiment, logic, information, clarity, and neutrality properties. We then estimated individual biases and consensus ratings that were used in training regression models. Firstly, we found that trustworthiness was significantly correlated to the information, neutrality and logic of the texts. Secondly, individual ratings for information and logic were significantly biased by the age and diet of the raters. Our best regression models explained up to 70% of the total variance of consensus ratings based on the low-level properties of texts, such as semantic embeddings, presence of key-terms and part-of-speech tags, references, quotes and paragraphs. With a novel combination of crowdsourcing, behavioral analysis, natural language processing and predictive modeling, our study contributes to the automated identification of reliable and high-quality online information. While critical evaluation of truthfulness cannot be surrendered to the machine only, our findings provide new insights into automated evaluation of subjective text properties and analysis of morphologically-rich languages in regards to trustworthiness."
https://openalex.org/W3048049998,"To divide replicated chromosomes equally between daughter cells, kinetochores must attach to microtubules emanating from opposite poles of the mitotic spindle (biorientation). An error correction mechanism facilitates this process by destabilizing erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Here we present a stochastic model of kinetochore-microtubule attachments, via an essential protein Ndc80 in budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using the model, we calculate the stochastic dynamics of a pair of sister kinetochores as they transition among different attachment states. First of all, we determine the kinase-to-phosphatase balance point that maximizes the probability of biorientation, while starting from an erroneous attachment state. We find that the balance point is sensitive to the rates of microtubule-Ndc80 dissociation and derive an approximate analytical formula that defines the balance point. Secondly, we determine the probability of transition from low-tension amphitelic to monotelic attachment and find that, despite this probability being approximately 33%, biorientation can be achieved with high probability. Thirdly, we calculate the contribution of the geometrical orientation of sister kinetochores to the probability of biorientation and show that, in the absence of geometrical orientation, the biorientation error rate is much larger than that observed in experiments. Finally, we study the coupling of the error correction mechanism to the spindle assembly checkpoint by calculating the average binding of checkpoint-related proteins to the kinetochore during the error correction process."
https://openalex.org/W3048251433,"Mycobacterium ulcerans, a non-tuberculous mycobacterium responsible for Buruli ulcer, resides in poorly defined environmental niches in the vicinity of stagnant water. Very few isolates have been confirmed. With a view to culturing M. ulcerans from such contaminated environmental specimens, we tested the in vitro susceptibility of the M. ulcerans CU001 strain co-cultivated with XTC cells to anti-infectious molecules registered in the French pharmacopoeia. We used a standardised concentration to identify molecules that were inactive against M. ulcerans and which could be incorporated into a decontaminating solution. Of 116 tested molecules, 64 (55.1%) molecules were ineffective against M. ulcerans CU001. These included 34 (29.3%) antibiotics, 14 (12%) antivirals, eight (6.8%) antiparasitics, and eight (6.8%) antifungals. This left 52 molecules which were active against M. ulcerans CU001. Three of the inactive antimicrobial molecules (oxytetracycline, polymyxin E and voriconazole) were then selected to prepare a decontamination solution which was shown to respect M. ulcerans CU001 viability. These three antimicrobials could be incorporated into a decontamination solution to potentially isolate and culture M. ulcerans from environmental samples."
