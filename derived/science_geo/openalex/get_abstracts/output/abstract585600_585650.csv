However, sites where thousand-year-old bones and other remains can be found are relatively rare. Slon et al. wanted to exploit any trace remains that our ancestors left behind. They looked for ancient DNA of hominids and other mammals in cave sediments, even those lacking skeletal remains. They identified mitochondrial DNA from Neandertal and Denisovan individuals in cave sediments at multiple sites. Science , this issue p. 605"

Zhao et al. examined the regulatory pathways that manage the transition from somatic to germ cell development in the small plant Arabidopsis (see the Perspective by Vielle-Calzada). The transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS) was needed early on for development of ovules. Soon after, a trio of inhibitors that work through a cyclin-dependent kinase allowed a transcriptional repressor to down-regulate WUS. This opened the door to meiosis, while restricting the number of reproductive units per seed to one. Science , this issue p. eaaf6532 ; see also p. 378"

Because RET can only generate ROS when mitochondria are fully polarized, this mechanism is self-limiting once PTP opens during reperfusion. In the accompanying article (Korge, P., Calmettes, G., John, S. A., and Weiss, J. N. (2017) J. Biol. Chem. 292, 9882–9895), we showed that ROS production after PTP opening can be sustained when complex III is damaged (simulated by antimycin). Here we show that complex II can also contribute to sustained ROS production in isolated rabbit cardiac mitochondria following inner membrane pore formation induced by either alamethicin or calcium-induced PTP opening. Two conditions are required to maximize malonate-sensitive ROS production by complex II in isolated mitochondria: (a) complex II inhibition by atpenin A5 or complex III inhibition by stigmatellin that results in succinate-dependent reduction of the dicarboxylate-binding site of complex II (site IIf); (b) pore opening in the inner membrane resulting in rapid efflux of succinate/fumarate and other dicarboxylates capable of competitively binding to site IIf. The decrease in matrix [dicarboxylate] allows O2 access to reduced site IIf, thereby making electron donation to O2 possible, explaining the rapid increase in ROS production provided that site IIf is reduced. Because ischemia is known to inhibit complexes II and III and increase matrix succinate/fumarate levels, we hypothesize that by allowing dicarboxylate efflux from the matrix, PTP opening during reperfusion may activate sustained ROS production by this mechanism after RET-driven ROS production has ceased.

https://openalex.org/W2608001712,"Recent advances in developing opioid treatments for pain with reduced side effects have focused on the signaling cascades of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR). However, few such signaling targets have been identified for exploitation. To address this need, we explored the role of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in opioid-induced MOR signaling and pain, which has only been studied in four previous articles. First, in four cell models of MOR signaling, we found that Hsp90 inhibition for 24 h with the inhibitor 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) had different effects on protein expression and opioid signaling in each line, suggesting that cell models may not be reliable for predicting pharmacology with this protein. We thus developed an in vivo model using CD-1 mice with an intracerebroventricular injection of 17-AAG for 24 h. We found that Hsp90 inhibition strongly blocked morphine-induced anti-nociception in models of post-surgical and HIV neuropathic pain but only slightly blocked anti-nociception in a naive tail-flick model, while enhancing morphine-induced precipitated withdrawal. Seeking a mechanism for these changes, we found that Hsp90 inhibition blocks ERK MAPK activation in the periaqueductal gray and caudal brain stem. We tested these signaling changes by inhibiting ERK in the above-mentioned pain models and found that ERK inhibition could account for all of the changes in anti-nociception induced by Hsp90 inhibition. Taken together, these findings suggest that Hsp90 promotes opioid-induced anti-nociception by an ERK mechanism in mouse brain and that Hsp90 could be a future target for improving the therapeutic index of opioid drugs.

Chronic pain is a serious public health problem in the United States, with an estimated ∼100 million affected people and an annual economic cost of $600 billion (1.Gaskin D.J. Richard P. The economic costs of pain in the United States.J. Pain. 2012; 13: 715-724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar). Moderate to severe cancer and non-cancer chronic pain seriously degrades patient quality of life and interferes with daily activities (2.Breivik H. Cherny N. Collett B. de Conno F. Filbet M.

Oncol. 2009; 20: 1420-1433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). There are multiple drug classes for the treatment of chronic pain, including tricyclic antidepressants and gabapentinoids, but often the only efficacious option for serious pain is opioid drugs such as morphine or fentanyl. Although efficacious, opioid drugs induce a constellation of side effects, including abuse liability, tolerance, constipation, and respiratory depression (3.National Clinical Guideline Centre for Acute and Chronic Conditions (Great Britain) Opioids in Palliative Care: Safe and Effective Prescribing of Strong Opioids for Pain in Palliative Care of Adults.

These limitations have spurred a search for new analgesic drugs with a reduction or elimination of side effects, which has persisted for more than 100 years with little success (5.Woodcock J.

Notably, the ubiquitous signaling regulator β-arrestin2 (βarr2) has been found to reduce anti-nociception (6.Bohn L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Gainetdinov R.R. Peppel K. Caron M.G. Lin F.T.

Although promising, this signal transduction-focused approach is limited by the availability of signaling targets to exploit; some targets such as Raf-1 (12.Yue X. Varga E.V. Stropova D.

To address this need and improve our chances of developing new opioid therapies, we investigated the ubiquitous and crucial signaling regulator Hsp90 as a potential regulator of opioid signaling and behavioral responses. Hsp90 is a chaperone protein that prevents protein aggregation and degradation. However, it can also facilitate the activation of signal transduction molecules, including kinases, by promoting a conformation that is ideal for activation (14.Li J. Buchner J. Structure, function and regulation of the hsp90 machinery.Biomed. J. 2013; 36: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 15.Ota A. Zhang J. Ping P. Han J. Wang Y. Specific regulation of noncanonical p38α activation by Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone complex in cardiomyocyte.Circ. Res. 2010; 106: 1404-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Hsp90, present in all cell types, makes up 2–3% of total cell protein content and up to 4–5% during heat stress. The activity of Hsp90 is regulated and directed by co-chaperone proteins, including Hop/STIP1 and Cdc37, which are more selective by tissue and signaling type than Hsp90 itself (14.Li J. Buchner J. Structure, function and regulation of the hsp90 machinery.Biomed. J. 2013; 36: 106-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 16.Odunuga O.O. Longshaw V.M. Blatch G.L. Hop: more than an Hsp70/Hsp90 adaptor protein.Bioessays. 2004; 26: 1058-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because of this selectivity, co-chaperone proteins may represent future targets for modulation that could decrease the side effects of modulating Hsp90 itself, as has been done for Hsp70 (17.Assimon V.A. Gillies A.T. Rauch J.N. Gestwicki J.E. Hsp70 protein complexes as drug targets.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2013; 19: 404-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Hsp90 has only been studied in two pain models to date. First, it has been found that Hsp90 inhibition reverses diabetes-induced mechanical hypoalgesia (18.Urban M.J. Li C. Yu C. Lu Y. Krise J.M. McIntosh M.P. Rajewski R.A. Blagg B.S. Dobrowsky R.T. Inhibiting heat-shock protein 90 reverses sensory hypoalgesia in diabetic mice.ASN Neuro. 2010; 2: e00040Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Second, it has been shown that Hsp90 inhibition reverses chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced mechanical allodynia and potentiates morphine anti-nociception in this model, whereas Hsp90 activation has the opposite effect when combined with lipopolysaccharide treatment (19.Hutchinson M.R. Ramos K.M. Loram L.C. Wieseler J. Sholar P.W. Kearney J.J. Lewis M.T. Crysdale N.Y. Zhang Y. Harrison J.A. Maier S.F. Rice K.C. Watkins L.R. Evidence for a role of heat shock protein-90 in toll like receptor 4-mediated pain enhancement in rats.Neuroscience. 2009; 164: 1821-1832Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Only two studies have examined the role of Hsp90 specifically in MOR signal transduction and opioid response. One study found in an in vitro model that Hsp90 inhibition reduces adenylyl cyclase superactivation, a cellular marker of dependence (20.Koshimizu T.A. Tsuchiya H. Tsuda H. Fujiwara Y. Shibata K. Hirasawa A. Tsujimoto G. Fujimura A. Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 attenuates adenylate cyclase sensitization after chronic morphine treatment.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2010; 392: 603-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). An article by the Devi group found that Hsp90 is up-regulated by chronic morphine treatment in the presynaptic terminal and that administration of the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin in the periphery immediately prior to naloxone precipitation reduces the somatic signs of withdrawal (21.Abul-Husn N.S. Annangudi S.P. Ma'ayan A. Ramos-Ortolaza D.L. Stockton Jr., S.D. Gomes I. Sweedler J.V. Devi L.A. Chronic morphine alters the presynaptic protein profile: identification of novel molecular targets using proteomics and network analysis.PloS One. 2011; 6: e25535Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This limited evidence from the literature suggests that Hsp90 has a role in regulating MOR signal transduction and opioid behavioral responses. However, in the CCI and dependence in vivo studies (19.Hutchinson M.R. Ramos K.M. Loram L.C. Wieseler J. Sholar P.W. Kearney J.J. Lewis M.T. Crysdale N.Y. Zhang Y. Harrison J.A. Maier S.F. Rice K.C.

In our current studies, we tested the role of Hsp90 in MOR signaling and pain using the selective inhibitor 17-AAG (22.Jhaveri K. Ochiana S.O. Dunphy M.P. Gerecitano J.F. Corben A.D. Peter R.I. Janjigian Y.Y. Gomes-DaGama E.M. Koren 3rd, J. Modi S. Chiosis G. Heat shock protein 90 inhibitors in the treatment of cancer: current status and future directions.Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs. 2014; 23: 611-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) on a 24-h treatment regimen to more closely model chronic pain treatment. The results from both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicated strong impacts of Hsp90 inhibition on opioid-induced signaling and pain behaviors, showing that Hsp90 regulates pain behavior through an ERK mechanism. These findings suggest that Hsp90 could be a target for promoting analgesia and reducing the side effects of opioid therapy. We first sought to explore the role of Hsp90 in regulating MOR signaling in four in vitro models. These include Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), human embryonic kidney (HEK), and human bone osteosarcoma (U2OS) cell lines stably expressing the human MOR (see “Experimental procedures” for cell line details) and the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, which endogenously expresses the MOR and δ-opioid receptor (DOR) (23.Wang Q. Traynor J.R. Modulation of μ-opioid receptor signaling by RGS19 in SH-SY5Y cells.Mol. Pharmacol. 2013; 83: 512-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). All cells were treated with 1 μm 17-AAG for 24 h and then stimulated with the MOR full agonist DAMGO ([d-Ala2, N-MePhe4, Gly2-ol]-enkephalin) for 10 min; signaling protein expression and signal transduction were analyzed by Western blotting. For signaling protein expression changes, we found that Hsp70 was induced in all four cell lines, which is a canonical effect of this class of Hsp90 inhibitors and serves as a marker of Hsp90 inhibition (Fig. 1, A and B) (24.Wang W. Liu Y. Zhao Z. Xie C. Xu Y. Hu Y. Quan H. Lou L. Y-632 inhibits Hsp90 function through disrupting the interaction of Hsp90-Hop and exerts antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo.Cancer Sci. 2016; 107: 782-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25.Kim N. Kim J.Y. Yenari M.A. Pharmacological induction of the 70-kDa heat shock protein protects against brain injury.Neuroscience. 2015; 284: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We also found that Hsp90 inhibition altered the protein expression levels of the MOR itself and of the signaling regulator βarr2 and the kinase Akt. Unlike Hsp70, however, the regulation of these protein levels differed considerably by cell line; the MOR was decreased in CHO cells but unaltered in HEK, βarr2 levels were decreased in U2OS but not CHO cells, and Akt levels were decreased in CHO cells but not U2OS (Fig. 1B). This heterogeneity continued when we analyzed the phosphorylation and activation of ERK (pERK) in these cells in response to DAMGO after Hsp90 inhibition (total ERK levels (tERK) were not altered by Hsp90 inhibition (Fig. 1A)). In CHO cells, the per-unit ERK activation was strongly increased by Hsp90 inhibition in response to DAMGO and the endogenous GPCR agonist lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) (Fig. 1C). However, in HEK cells the pattern of ERK activation was not changed by Hsp90 inhibition, whereas it was decreased in U2OS cells. Lastly, the SH-SY5Y cells displayed an unusual ERK activation pattern whereby the unstimulated baseline was strongly increased but ERK was not stimulated above that elevated baseline by either DAMGO or LPA. As summarized in Table 1, Hsp90 inhibition showed heterogeneous results in different cell lines, which suggested that in vitro models would not be reliable in studying the role of Hsp90 in the opioid system and would necessitate the use of relevant in vivo models for the study of this protein.Table 1Summary of the effects of Hsp90 inhibition in vitro For the in vivo studies, mice were treated with 17-AAG by the i.c.v. route to isolate the role of Hsp90 specifically in the brain, with a 24-h recovery time as described above, to more closely model chronic pain treatment. The i.c.v. route results in higher concentrations of injected drug molecules around the wall of the ventricles and associated areas, which have high levels of opioid receptors and are known to be important in producing various effects of opioid drugs such as morphine (e.g. anti-nociception, physical dependence, etc.). However, we could not find in the literature that 17-AAG had been administered by the i.c.v. route, although Hsp70 is up-regulated in the brain in response to systemic 17-AAG (25.Kim N. Kim J.Y. Yenari M.A. Pharmacological induction of the 70-kDa heat shock protein protects against brain injury.Neuroscience. 2015; 284: 912-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We thus performed a dose-response study of i.c.v. 17-AAG in male CD-1 mice, with a readout of Hsp70 up-regulation by Western blotting (Fig. 2). We found robust dose-dependent Hsp70 up-regulation in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), a region high in MOR expression and critical for pain regulation (26.Kovelowski C.J. Ossipov M.H. Sun H. Lai J. Malan T.P. Porreca F. Supraspinal cholecystokinin may drive tonic descending facilitation mechanisms to maintain neuropathic pain in the rat.Pain. 2000; 87: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), with an approximate A50 of 0.084 nmol. Based on these results, we chose the approximate A90 dose of 0.5 nmol for further studies, which reduced the risk of off-target effects from using the highest dose tested (5 nmol). We then tested the effects of Hsp90 inhibition on opioid response in several pain and dependence/withdrawal models. We first established a clinically relevant post-surgical pain model by paw incision (27.Pogatzki E.M. Raja S.N. A mouse model of incisional pain.Anesthesiology. 2003; 99: 1023-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) with concurrent 17-AAG injection and a 24-h recovery. Pain response and allodynia were measured by mechanical stimulation with Von Frey filaments (28.Chaplan S.R. Bach F.W. Pogrel J.W. Chung J.M. Yaksh T.L. Quantitative assessment of tactile allodynia in the rat paw.J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 53: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5500) Google Scholar). The animals showed a robust allodynia post-surgery that was not altered by 17-AAG treatment (Fig. 3A). The vehicle-treated animals showed a robust time-dependent anti-nociception in response to systemic morphine (1, 3.2, and 10 mg/kg s.c.), which was strongly blocked by 17-AAG treatment (area under the curve (AUC) reduction of 70.2, 81.5, and 67.0% at 1, 3.2, and 10 mg/kg with 17-AAG) (Fig. 3A and Table 2). The AUC values from individual mice at the three dosages were used to construct dose-response curves (Fig. 3B). Analysis of these curves showed an A50 of 3.98 mg/kg for vehicle-treated mice and an A50 of 522.2 mg/kg for 17-AAG-treated mice, a 131.2-fold shift (Table 2). We observed strongly reduced but still present anti-nociception in 17-AAG-treated mice at 10 mg/kg morphine but not at 1 and 3.2 mg/kg, suggesting that this shift represents a change in potency (not efficacy) of the opioid system in this pain model with 17-AAG treatment.Table 2Summary of in vivo anti-nociception assaysTable 2Summary of in vivo anti-nociception assays Seeking to determine whether this effect of 17-AAG was consistent across pain models, we next tested the effects of the inhibitor in a model of thermal tail-flick anti-nociception in naive mice treated with i.c.v. DAMGO. Tail-flick baselines were not altered by 17-AAG treatment, whereas both vehicle- and 17-AAG-treated mice displayed robust anti-nociception in response to 0.01, 0.032, and 0.1 nmol of DAMGO i.c.v. (Fig. 3C). 17-AAG treatment reduced the extent of the anti-nociception but by far less than in the paw-incision model, with an AUC increase of 5.3% at 0.01 nmol and a reduction of 19.6 and 18.2% at 0.032 and 0.1 nmol (Fig. 3C and Table 2 compared with a 67.0–81.5% reduction with paw incision). As described above, the AUC values of the individual mice were used to construct dose-response curves (Fig. 3D). Analysis of these curves revealed an A50 of 0.095 nmol for vehicle-treated mice and an A50 of 0.251 nmol for 17-AAG-treated mice; this was a 2.64-fold shift, far less than the 131.2-fold shift for paw incision (Table 2). Because the magnitude of the anti-nociception was equal for both vehicle- and 17-AAG-treated mice at the low dose of 0.01 nmol, we concluded that 17-AAG treatment reduces the efficacy (not potency) of the opioid system in this pain model. Both the paw-incision and tail-flick models represent acute pain, with durations of 24 h or less. To investigate the role of Hsp90 in chronic pain anti-nociception, we established a mouse model of HIV peripheral neuropathy (29.Yuan S.B. Shi Y. Chen J. Zhou X. Li G. Gelman B.B. Lisinicchia J.G.

The pain state was induced by intrathecal injection of HIV gp120 protein at days 1, 3, and 5, which induced a progressive and strong mechanical allodynia over a 3-week treatment period (Fig. 3E). We injected 17-AAG on day 20 as described above and measured mechanical allodynia as for the paw-incision experiments on day 21 in response to 10 mg/kg morphine. As for the other two pain models, 17-AAG treatment did not alter the pain baseline. However, 17-AAG treatment completely abolished anti-nociception in response to 10 mg/kg morphine s.c. (AUC reduction of 97.6%) (Fig. 3F and Table 2). This result demonstrates that Hsp90 has a strong role in chronic pain anti-nociception, likely stronger than in acute pain. Dose-response experiments could not be completed in this model, as the motor-activating effects of the next half-log dose of morphine (32 mg/kg) were too strong for us to reliably measure mechanical thresholds. We next tested the effects of Hsp90 inhibition on the opioid side effects of dependence and withdrawal. This was performed first in an acute model of dependence and withdrawal, with 17-AAG treatment for 20 h as described above, a single 100 mg/kg s.c. injection of morphine with a 4-h recovery, and the precipitation of withdrawal with 10 mg/kg naloxone i.p. (Fig. 4A). We also tested 17-AAG in a model of chronic dependence and withdrawal, with an escalating dosage protocol over 4 days (see “Experimental procedures”) with daily re-injection of 17-AAG, and precipitation of withdrawal on day 4 with 30 mg/kg naloxone i.p. (Fig. 4B). In both models of dependence and withdrawal, 17-AAG treatment significantly increased the production of withdrawal-associated feces and urine without altering jumping behavior. The above results suggest that Hsp90 inhibition with 17-AAG worsens the opioid therapeutic index by decreasing anti-nociception and increasing side effects. Lastly, to determine whether the above results were due to off-target motor, sedative, or similar effects, we measured the effect of 17-AAG treatment on performance in the rotarod test (30.Vanderah T.W. Largent-Milnes T. Lai J. Porreca F. Houghten R.A. Menzaghi F. Wisniewski K. Stalewski J. Sueiras-Diaz J. Galyean R. Schteingart C. Junien J.L. Trojnar J. Rivière P.J. Novel d-amino acid tetrapeptides produce potent antinociception by selectively acting at peripheral κ-opioid receptors.Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2008; 583: 62-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both 17-AAG and vehicle-treated mice had unaltered performance in this test, suggesting that the above results are specific to the opioid system and are not off-target (Fig. 4C). In an effort to explore the mechanism of Hsp90 regulation of the above-described opioid-induced behaviors, we measured brain protein expression and ERK and Akt signal transduction in the PAG and caudal brain stem (pons and medulla) by Western blotting after 24 h of 17-AAG treatment and 0.1 nmol of DAMGO administered i.c.v. for 10 min. As expected, we found up-regulation of Hsp70 in both brain regions in response to 17-AAG (Fig. 5, A–C). Contrary to some of our in vitro findings shown in Fig. 1B, we did not observe changes in MOR, βarr2, or STAT3. Importantly for our analysis, 17-AAG treatment did not change the protein expression levels of GAPDH, tERK, or tAkt (Fig. 5, A–C, and data not shown). Both brain regions also displayed an unusual pattern of ERK signaling in response to 17-AAG whereby the pERK baseline was increased to the same level as DAMGO stimulation in the vehicle-treated brains, but stimulation above that baseline in response to DAMGO was completely lost (Fig. 5, D and E). This was a similar pattern of signaling as observed in SH-SY5Y cells treated with 17-AAG (Fig. 1C). We also examined pAkt levels in both regions and found a pattern similar to but less robust than the ERK signaling pattern (Fig. 5, F and G). As a control, we also examined ERK activation in mice treated with 5 nmol of 17-AAG, the highest dose tested in our dose-response experiment shown in Fig. 2. The ERK pattern observed in this experiment was identical to that observed with 0.5 nmol of 17-AAG, with no increase in the magnitude of signaling, further justifying the choice of 0.5 nmol of 17-AAG for our studies (Fig. 5H). In our signaling studies of mouse brain, we determined that Hsp70 expression and ERK signaling were altered by 17-AAG treatment. We thus tested these two proteins as mechanisms for Hsp90 regulation of anti-nociception. First, we tested the role of Hsp70 by combining Hsp90 inhibition by 17-AAG with Hsp70 inhibition by pifithrin-μ, a selective Hsp70 inhibitor. 17-AAG and 50 μg of pifithrin-μ, a previously established i.c.v. dose of this inhibitor (31.Qin W.J. Wang Y.T. Zhang M. Wen R.T. Liu Q. Li Y.L. Chen F. Lawrence A.J. Liang J.H.

Neuropsychopharmacol. 2013; 16: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), were co-injected i.c.v. with a 24-h recovery (along with single drug and vehicle controls). The mice were then i.c.v. injected with 0.1 nmol of DAMGO i.c.v., and a tail-flick assay performed as described above. We found that pifithrin-μ had no effect on the tail-flick response, with indistinguishable vehicle and pifithrin groups (AUC of 100 and 100.5%), and indistinguishable 17-AAG and 17-AAG/pifithrin groups (AUC of 76.3 and 78.7%) (Fig. 6A). This finding suggests that up-regulated Hsp70 is not responsible for the anti-nociception changes we observed. For ERK signaling, we reasoned that the loss of DAMGO stimulation seen with 17-AAG treatment (Fig. 5, D and E) was more critical for acute anti-nociception than the elevated baseline. We thus modeled the change in ERK signaling seen with 17-AAG by i.c.v. injection of 5 μg of U0126, a selective ERK inhibitor used at this i.c.v. dose previously (32.Zeni A.L. Zomkowski A.D.

In the present work, the invasive shrub ""Eupatorium adenophorum"" was utilized as a sustainable feedstock for making biochar under different pyrolysis conditions in Nepal. Biochar was produced using several different types of kilns; four sub types of flame curtain kilns (deep-cone metal kiln, steel shielded soil pit, conical soil pit and steel small cone), brick-made traditional kiln, traditional earth-mound kiln and top lift up draft (TLUD). The resultant biochars showed consistent pH (9.1 ± 0.3), cation exchange capacities (133 ± 37 cmolc kg-1), organic carbon contents (73.9 ± 6.4%) and surface areas (35 to 215 m2/g) for all kiln types. A pot trial with maize was carried out to investigate the effect on maize biomass production of the biochars made with various kilns, applied at 1% and 4% dosages. Biochars were either pretreated with hot or cold mineral nutrient enrichment (mixing with a nutrient solution before or after cooling down, respectively), or added separately from the same nutrient dosages to the soil. Significantly higher CEC (P< 0.05), lower Al/Ca ratios (P< 0.05), and high OC% (P<0.001) were observed for both dosages of biochar as compared to non-amended control soils. Importantly, the study showed that biochar made by flame curtain kilns resulted in the same agronomic effect as biochar made by the other kilns (P > 0.05). At a dosage of 1% biochar, the hot nutrient-enriched biochar led to significant increases of 153% in above ground biomass production compared to cold nutrient-enriched biochar and 209% compared to biochar added separately from the nutrients. Liquid nutrient enhancement of biochar thus improved fertilizer effectiveness compared to separate application of biochar and fertilizer."
https://openalex.org/W2608762228,"Background Neonatal sepsis in preterm infants is often due to organisms that colonize the skin including Staphylococcus spp. and Candida spp. Development and maturation of the skin microbiome in the neonatal period, especially in preterm infants, may be critical in preventing colonization with pathogens and subsequent progression to neonatal sepsis. Development of the skin microbiome in preterm infants or its determinants in the first 4 weeks of life has not been evaluated. Methods We evaluated the skin microbiome from three body sites, antecubital fossa, forehead and gluteal region, in a prospective cohort of 15 preterm (birth weight < 1500 g and < 32 weeks of gestation) and 15 term neonates. The microbiome community membership and relative abundance were evaluated by amplification and sequencing the bacterial V3-V5 region of the16S rRNA gene on the 454 GS FLX platform. We used linear mixed effects models to analyze longitudinal data. Results The structure and composition of the skin microbiome did not differ between the three sampling sites for term and preterm infants in the neonatal period. However, skin bacterial richness was positively associated with gestational age in the first four weeks of life. Intravenous antibiotics negatively impacted the bacterial diversity of the skin but we did not see differences with respect to feeding or mode of delivery. Conclusions Gestational age, which influences the maturity of skin structure and function, is associated with the development of the preterm cutaneous microbiome. Understanding the maturation of a healthy skin microbiome, prevention of pathogen colonization and its role in the development of immunity will be pivotal in the development of novel interventions to prevent infections in critically ill preterm infants."

Here, we introduce a new technology based on biomimicry wherein the protein-protein interfaces of two different immunoglobulin (Ig) constant domain pairs are exchanged in part or fully to design new heterodimeric domains. The method can be applied across Igs to design Fc heterodimers and bsAbs. We investigated interfaces from human IgA CH3, IgD CH3, IgG1 CH3, IgM CH4, T-cell receptor (TCR) α/β, and TCR γ/δ constant domain pairs, and we found that they successfully drive human IgG1 CH3 or IgM CH4 heterodimerization to levels similar to or above those of reference methods. A comprehensive interface exchange between the TCR α/β constant domain pair and the IgG1 CH3 homodimer was evidenced by X-ray crystallography and used to engineer examples of bsAbs for cancer therapy. Parental antibody pairs were rapidly reformatted into scalable bsAbs that were free of homodimer traces by combining interface exchange, asymmetric Protein A binding, and the scFv × Fab format. In summary, we successfully built several new CH3- or CH4-based heterodimers that may prove useful for designing new bsAb-based therapeutics, and we anticipate that our approach could be broadly implemented across the Ig constant domain family.

https://openalex.org/W2607796932,"Extra-Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) is a fundamental component of the Mediterranean diet and it may contain several anti-oxidant substances, such as phenols. Previous research has shown that this food may be enriched in phenols by spraying a sodium-selenate solution (100 mg L-1 Se) onto the crop canopy before flowering. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of this Se-fertilization before flowering (cv. Leccino) on the phenolic profile of EVOOs, and test to what extent such effects depend on the weather pattern, as observed in two contrasting experimental seasons (2013 and 2014). Results showed that Se-fertilisation enriched EVOOs both in selenium (up to 120 μg kg-1) and in phenols (up to 401 mg kg-1). This latter enrichment was related to an increase in PAL (L-Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase) activities and it was largely independent on the climatic pattern. Considering the phenolic profile, oleacein, ligustroside, aglycone and oleocanthal were the most affected compounds and were increased by 57, 50 and 32%, respectively. All these compounds, especially oleacein, have been shown to exert a relevant anti-oxidant activity, contributing both to the shelf-life of EVOOs and to positive effects on human health. It is suggested that Se-fertilisation of olive trees before flowering may be an interesting practice, particularly with poor cultivars and cold and rainy weather patterns, which would normally lead to the production of EVOOs with unfavourable phenolic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2607992035,"Aphids are a species rich group comprising many important pests. However, species identification can be very difficult for aphids due to their morphological ambiguity. DNA barcoding has been widely adopted for rapid and reliable species identification as well as cryptic species detection. In this study, we investigated cryptic diversity in the subfamily Calaphidinae (Hemiptera: Aphididae) based on 899 sequences of cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) for 115 morphospecies (78 species collected in this study and sequences of 73 species downloaded from Genbank). Among these 115 morphospecies, DNA barcoding results of 90 (78.3%) species were identical to results of morphological identification. However, 25 (21.7%) morphospecies showed discrepancies between DNA barcoding and traditional taxonomy. Among these 25 discordances, a total of 15 cryptic species were identified from 12 morphospecies. We also found three morphologically distinct species pairs that sharing DNA barcoding. Based on molecular operational taxonomic unit (MOTU) estimation, we discussed on species delimitation threshold value for these taxa. Our findings confirm that Calaphidinae has high cryptic diversity even though aphids are relatively well-studied."
https://openalex.org/W2607891440,"Vitrification is a powerful tool for the efficient production of offspring derived from cryopreserved oocytes or embryos in mammalian species including domestic animals. Genome editing technologies such as transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/ CRISPR-associated (Cas)9 are now available even for domestic species, suggesting that the vitrification of embryos at the pronuclear stage (PN) will be more important because they could provide genomic host cells to be targeted by TALENs or CRISPR/Cas9. Although we reported the successful production of piglets derived from vitrified PN embryos by a solid-surface vitrification method with glutathione supplementation, further improvements are required. The cryoprotective agent (CPA) carboxylated ε-poly-L-lysine (COOH-PLL) was introduced in 2009. COOH-PLL reduces the physical and physiological damage caused by cryopreservation in mammalian stem cells and the vitrification of mouse oocytes and embryos. Those results suggested that vitrification of COOH-PLL may help improve the developmental ability of pig embryos vitrified at the PN stage. However, it remains unclear whether COOH-PLL is available as a CPA for the vitrification of embryos in domestic species. In this study, we evaluated COOH-PLL as a CPA with ethylene glycol (EG) and Cryotop as a device for the vitrification of PN pig embryos. Exposure to vitrification solution supplemented with COOH-PLL up to 30% did not decrease developmental ability to the 2-cell stage and the blastocyst stage. After warming, most of the vitrified embryos survived regardless of the concentration of COOH-PLL (76.0 ± 11.8% to 91.8 ± 4.6%). However, the vitrified embryos without COOH-PLL showed a lower development rate up to the blastocyst stage (1.3 ± 1.0%) compared to the fresh embryos (28.4 ± 5.0%) (p<0.05). In contrast, supplementation of 20% (w/v) COOH-PLL in the vitrification solution dramatically improved the developmental ability to blastocysts of the vitrified embryos (19.4 ± 4.6%) compared to those without COOH-PLL (p<0.05). After the transfer of embryos vitrified with 30% (v/v) EG and 20% (w/v) COOH-PLL, we successfully obtained 15 piglets from 8 recipients. Taken together, our present findings demonstrate for the first time that COOH-PLL is an effective CPA for embryo vitrification in the pig. COOH-PLL is a promising CPA for further improvements in the vitrification of oocytes and embryos in mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W2607688559,"Cellulose synthesis in bacteria is a complex process involving the concerted action of several enzymes whose genes are often organized in operons. This process influences many fundamental physiological aspects such as bacteria and host interaction, biofilm formation, among others. Although it might sound contradictory, the participation of cellulose-degrading enzymes is critical to this process. The presence of endoglucanases from family 8 of glycosyl hydrolases (GH8) in bacterial cellulose synthase (Bcs) complex has been described in different bacteria, including the model organism Komagataeibacter xylinus; however, their role in this process is not completely understood. In this study, we describe the biochemical characterization and three-dimensional structure of a novel GH8 member from Raoultella ornithinolytica, named AfmE1, which was previously identified by our group from the metagenomic analysis of the giant snail Achatina fulica. Our results demonstrated that AfmE1 is an endo-β-1,4-glucanase, with maximum activity in acidic to neutral pH over a wide temperature range. This enzyme cleaves cello-oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization ≥ 5 and presents six glucosyl-binding subsites. The structural comparison of AfmE1 with other GH8 endoglucanases showed significant structural dissimilarities in the catalytic cleft, particularly in the subsite +3, which correlate with different functional mechanisms, such as the recognition of substrate molecules having different arrangements and crystallinities. Together, these findings provide new insights into molecular and structural features of evolutionarily conserved endoglucanases from the bacterial cellulose biosynthetic machinery."

Here, we generated a neuron-targeted Cav-1-overexpressing transgenic (Tg) mouse [synapsin-driven Cav-1 (SynCav1 Tg)] and subjected it to a controlled cortical impact model of brain trauma and measured biochemical, anatomic, and behavioral changes. SynCav1 Tg mice exhibited increased hippocampal expression of Cav-1 and membrane/lipid raft localization of postsynaptic density protein 95, NMDA receptor, and tropomyosin receptor kinase B. When subjected to a controlled cortical impact, SynCav1 Tg mice demonstrated preserved hippocampus-dependent fear learning and memory, improved motor function recovery, and decreased brain lesion volume compared with wild-type controls. Neuron-targeted overexpression of Cav-1 in the adult brain prevents hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits, restores motor function after brain trauma, and decreases brain lesion size induced by trauma. Our findings demonstrate that neuron-targeted Cav-1 can be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to restore brain function and prevent trauma-associated maladaptive plasticity.-Egawa, J., Schilling, J.

We examined the determinants of the use and expenses of formal care among in-home elderly adults in Shanghai. A two-part model based on the data from the Shanghai Long-Term Care Needs Assessment Questionnaire was applied. A total of 8428 participants responded in 2014 and 7100 were followed up in 2015. The determinants of the probability of using formal care were analyzed in the first part of the model and the determinants of formal care expenses were analyzed in the second part. Demographic indicators, living arrangements, physical health status, and care type in 2014 were selected as independent variables. We found that individuals of older age; women; those with higher Activities of Daily Living (ADL) scores; those without spouse; those with higher income; those suffering from stroke, dementia, lower limb fracture, or advanced tumor; and those with previous experience of formal and informal care were more likely to receive formal care in 2015. Furthermore, age, income and formal care fee in 2014 were significant predictors of formal care expenses in 2015. Taken together, the results showed that formal care provision in Shanghai was not determined by ADL scores, but was instead more related to income. This implied an inappropriate distribution of formal care among elderly population in Shanghai. Additionally, it appeared difficult for the elderly to quit the formal care once they begun to use it. These results highlighted the importance of assessing the need for formal care, and suggested that the government offer guidance on formal care use for the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2607826851,"Pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP) is an essential cofactor for numerous enzymes involved in a diversity of cellular processes in living organisms. Previous analysis of the Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae S-8 genome sequence revealed the presence of pdxS and pdxT genes, which are implicated in deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP)-independent pathway of PLP biosynthesis; however, little is known about their roles in A. pleuropneumoniae pathogenicity. Our data demonstrated that A. pleuropneumoniae could synthesize PLP by PdxS and PdxT enzymes. Disruption of the pdxS and pdxT genes rendered the pathogen auxotrophic for PLP, and the defective growth as a result of these mutants was chemically compensated by the addition of PLP, suggesting the importance of PLP production for A. pleuropneumoniae growth and viability. Additionally, the pdxS and pdxT deletion mutants displayed morphological defects as indicated by irregular and aberrant shapes in the absence of PLP. The reduced growth of the pdxS and pdxT deletion mutants under osmotic and oxidative stress conditions suggests that the PLP synthases PdxS/PdxT are associated with the stress tolerance of A. pleuropneumoniae. Furthermore, disruption of the PLP biosynthesis pathway led to reduced colonization and attenuated virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae in the BALB/c mouse model. The data presented in this study reveal the critical role of PLP synthases PdxS/PdxT in viability, stress tolerance, and virulence of A. pleuropneumoniae."
https://openalex.org/W2608699228,"We investigate the influence of intrinsic noise on stable states of a one-dimensional dynamical system that shows in its deterministic version a saddle-node bifurcation between monostable and bistable behaviour. The system is a modified version of the Schlögl model, which is a chemical reaction system with only one type of molecule. The strength of the intrinsic noise is varied without changing the deterministic description by introducing bursts in the autocatalytic production step. We study the transitions between monostable and bistable behavior in this system by evaluating the number of maxima of the stationary probability distribution. We find that changing the size of bursts can destroy and even induce saddle-node bifurcations. This means that a bursty production of molecules can qualitatively change the dynamics of a chemical reaction system even when the deterministic description remains unchanged."

Accumulating data reveal that O-GlcNAcylation as “protein code” or “histone code” may provide recognition platforms or executive instructions for subsequent proteins to carry out biological processes (7Sakabe K.

For example, O-GlcNAcylation by OGT to the specific repeats region of host cell factor 1 (HCF1) may provide instructions for HCF1 proteolysis (8Capotosti F. Guernier S. Lammers F. Waridel P. Cai Y.

TET proteins (including TET1/2/3) regulate gene transcription by catalyzing the conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Research evidence suggests that the coordination of TET2/TET3 and OGT regulates the binding of the SET1-COMPASS histone H3K4 methyltransferase to chromatin, thus further controlling subsequent gene transcription (11Deplus R.

We previously purified and characterized a novel human MOF (hMOF)-containing HAT nonspecific lethal (NSL) complex that was composed of nine subunits including the male-specific lethal (MSL) 1-like protein NSL1, NSL2 (FLJ20436), NSL3 (FLJ10081), HCF1, plant homeodomain-linked finger-containing protein PHF20, O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase, isoform 1 (OGT1), WD repeat protein 5, microspherule protein 1 (15Cai Y.

Chem. 2010; 285: 4268-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and hMOF as a catalytic subunit of the NSL complex (Fig. 1A, left). Compared with the traditional hMOF-containing MSL complex that plays a key role in fly dosage compensation and is specifically responsible for histone H4 Lys-16 acetylation (H4K16ac) (16Rea S. Xouri G. Akhtar A. Males absent on the first (MOF): from flies to humans.Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5385-5394Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), the NSL complex possesses a broader substrate specificity and is able to acetylate H4 residues Lys-16, Lys-5, and Lys-8. Further studies indicate that the NSL complex functions in promoting histone H3 Lys-4 dimethylation activity by MLL-SET complexes in a unidirectional manner (17Zhao X. Su J. Wang F. Liu D. Ding J. Yang Y. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Cao L. Wu D. Wu M. Cai Y. Jin J.

Although biochemical purifications combined multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT) analysis confirmed that OGT1 is closely associated with the NSL complex (15Cai Y. Jin J. Swanson S.K. Cole M.D. Choi S.H. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Subunit composition and substrate specificity of a MOF-containing histone acetyltransferase distinct from the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4268-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), there are many questions yet to be resolved such as (i) whether OGT1's O-GlcNAc transferase activity impacts the HAT activity of the NSL complex in cells, (ii) whether OGT1 physically interacts with the other NSL complex subunits, and (iii) whether any NSL complex subunit can be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT1. In an effort to address the above questions, a series of biochemical and molecular biological experimental approaches were used in this study. As we show below, our results clarify a new collaborative mechanism in which the stability of NSL3 in cells is associated with its O-GlcNAcylation by OGT1, and this modification further impacts the HAT activity of the NSL complex as reflected in changes in global histone H4 acetylation at lysine Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-16 in cells. The hMOF as a catalytic subunit forms two distinct HAT (NSL and MSL) complexes in cells (Fig. 1A, left). We previously identified a novel hMOF-containing HAT NSL complex that can acetylate histone H4 residues Lys-5, Lys-8, and Lys-16 (15Cai Y. Jin J. Swanson S.K. Cole M.D. Choi S.H. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Subunit composition and substrate specificity of a MOF-containing histone acetyltransferase distinct from the male-specific lethal (MSL) complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 4268-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OGT1 as a subunit of the NSL complex was identified by MudPIT analyses in anti-FLAG eluates of several stably expressed FLAG-tagged subunits of the NSL complex (15Cai Y. Jin J. Swanson S.K. Cole M.D. Choi S.H. Florens L. Washburn M.P. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C.

Chem. 2010; 285: 4268-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Conversely, all subunits of the NSL complex were also identified by MudPIT in anti-FLAG eluates from cells stably expressing FLAG-OGT1 (Fig. 1A, right), suggesting that OGT1 is stably assembled in the NSL complex. To know the role of OGT1 in the NSL complex, an in vitro HAT assay was first carried out with anti-FLAG eluates from cells stably expressing FLAG-PHF20 (a subunit of the NSL complex) after knocking down OGT1 with siRNA (Fig. 1B). Compared with non-targeting siRNA, decreased H4K16ac on reconstituted nucleosomes in OGT1 knockdown cells was observed (Fig. 1C). To further investigate whether OGT1 affects the global histone H4 acetylation in cells, experiments involving overexpression or knockdown of OGT1 in HeLa or human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T (293T) cells were performed. As shown in Fig. 1D, a remarkable increase of global H4K16ac by overexpression of OGT1 was visualized with immunofluorescence staining. However, a reduction of global H4K16ac, H4K5ac, and H4K8ac was observed in siOGT1-transfected 293T cells (Fig. 1E), suggesting a role of OGT1 in regulating the global acetylation of histone H4 residues Lys-16, Lys-5, and Lys-8 in cells. Quantified acetylation levels of histone H4 at lysines 5, 8, and 16 are shown in Fig. 1F. The potential importance of OGT1 in the NSL complex was confirmed by previous experiments. This prompted us to further clarify the structural relationship between OGT1 and the other NSL complex subunits. To do that, co-transfection/co-IP experiments were first designed using Myc-tagged OGT1 as bait. Besides HCF1, which has been reported to interact with OGT1 (18Mazars R. Gonzalez-de-Peredo A. Cayrol C. Lavigne A.C. Vogel J.L. Ortega N. Lacroix C. Gautier V. Huet G. Ray A. Monsarrat B. Kristie T.M. Girard J.P. The THAP-Zinc finger protein THAP1 associates with coactivator HCF-1 and O-GlcNAc transferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 13364-13371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), all other NSL complex subunits were tested. Based on the experimental results, the only direct interaction was observed between OGT1 and NSL3, a specific subunit of the NSL complex (Fig. 2A, lane 3) (other negative data not shown). To verify this result, it was further examined whether the endogenous OGT1 or NSL3 protein could be precipitated by overexpressed proteins. As expected, endogenous OGT1 (Fig. 2B, Flag IP/anti-OGT1) was immunoprecipitated by overexpressed FLAG-NSL3. Similarly, the endogenous NSL3 protein (Fig. 2C, Myc IP/anti-NSL3) was specifically immunoprecipitated by overexpressed Myc-OGT1 because no other proteins, such as MSL2 and MSL3, precipitated. Next, to further define the binding region of OGT1 with NSL3, we designed and constructed deletion mutants for OGT1 (Fig. 2D) and NSL3 (Fig. 2E). Co-transfection/co-IP experiments were then carried out. As expected, full-length NSL3 bound to the N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of OGT1 (OGT1-1) (Fig. 2F, lane 3), whereas full-length OGT1 interacted with N-terminal NSL3 (Fig. 2G, Flag IP/anti-Myc). It has been reported that the N terminus of NSL3 contains an abhydrolase domain, but the function of this domain is unclear (19Marchler-Bauer A. Derbyshire M.K. Gonzales N.R. Lu S. Chitsaz F. Geer L.Y. Geer R.C. He J. Gwadz M. Hurwitz D.I. Lanczycki C.J. Lu F. Marchler G.H. Song J.S. Thanki N. et al.CDD: NCBI's conserved domain database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D222-D226Crossref PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Thus, to determine whether the abhydrolase domain of NSL3 affects the binding activity between OGT1 and NSL3, we constructed a plasmid that contains full abhydrolase domain region (NSL3dC) (Fig. 3A, upper) and a plasmid lacking the abhydrolase domain (NSLdD) (Fig. 3B, upper). As shown in Fig. 3A (lower panel), compared with full-length NSL3, apparent increased binding activity between NSL3dC and OGT1-1 was observed (Myc IP/anti-FLAG, lane 5). In contrast, the binding activity between OGT1 and NSL3 was significantly decreased by deletion of the abhydrolase domain of NSL3 (Fig. 3B, lower panel, Flag IP/anti-Myc), suggesting the importance of the abhydrolase domain of NSL3 for binding to OGT1. The physical interaction between OGT1 and NSL3 raises the possibility that NSL3 may be a substrate of OGT1. To confirm our speculation, we first tested whether there were O-GlcNAc-modified proteins in anti-FLAG eluates from cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged NSL3. As shown in Fig. 4A, compared with parental 293FRT cells, multi-O-GlcNAc-modified signals were detected in the FLAG-NSL3 lane, suggesting the existence of O-GlcNAcylated NSL complex subunits, possibly including NSL3 and HCF1 (as has been reported). To further address this result, insect cell-expressed and purified FLAG-OGT1 (Fig. 4B, upper) and FLAG-NSL3 (Fig. 4C, upper) were used in an in vitro O-GlcNAc transferase assay. We first tested the enzyme activity of purified OGT1 by examining the O-GlcNAcylation of Nup62 (a known substrate of OGT1) by OGT1. After confirming the glycosylation activity of purified OGT1 (Fig. 4B, lower), the impact of OGT1 on recombinant NSL3 in an in vitro O-GlcNAc transferase assay was measured. As shown in Fig. 4C (lower, lanes 3 and 4), O-GlcNAc-modified NSL3 by OGT1 was visualized in the presence of donor UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Moreover, this O-GlcNAcylation on NSL3 was removed by adding the O-GlcNAc hydrolase OGA in the presence of either UDP-[3H]GlcNAc (Fig. 4D, upper, lanes 5 and 6) or cold UDP-GlcNAc (Fig. 4D, lower, lane 4). Thus, there is no doubt that OGT1 can O-GlcNAcylate NSL3 protein in vitro. WGA is a lectin that can bind O-GlcNAc residues, and it is often used to detect intracellular O-GlcNAcylated proteins (20Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Detection of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins.Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate the O-GlcNAc modification on NSL3 in cells, WGA lectin affinity purification of total cell lysates from 293T cells (Fig. 4E, upper panel) was carried out. As shown in Fig. 4E (lower panel), NSL3 was detected by immunoblot analysis of the precipitate (lanes 4 and 6). Specificity was shown by adding free GlcNAc during WGA lectin affinity purification (lane 3 and 5). Consistent with this, dose-dependent reduction of O-GlcNAc-modified endogenous NSL3 was confirmed by WGA affinity purification in FLAG-OGA-transfected cells (Fig. 4F). These results suggest the occurrence of O-GlcNAc modification on NSL3 in cells. In fact, during the experiments, higher protein levels of NSL3, either full length or deletion mutants, were observed in Input (Fig. 5A) after co-transfection of OGT1 and NSL3, suggesting a role of OGT1 in stabilizing the NSL3 protein. To confirm this phenomenon, we designed and performed experiments as indicated in Fig. 5A. Compared with NSL3-only transfection (first row, lane 2), the protein levels of NSL3 in Input increased by treating cells with MG132 (first row, lane 3) or co-transfection with OGT1 (first row, lane 4). Similar results were seen after FLAG IP/anti-FLAG (full-length NSL3; lanes 3–5). To further verify this phenomenon, knockdown of OGT1 with siRNA was carried out. There was no obvious change in NSL3 mRNA level (Fig. 5B), but the NSL3 protein level decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C, lanes 2 and 3). This behavior was further confirmed by detecting NSL3 protein at different time points (0, 3, 6, and 9 h) after treating cells with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX; 3 μg/ml). As shown in Fig. 5D, knockdown of OGT1 with siRNA accelerated the degradation of NSL3 (lanes 5–8) compared with that in the non-targeting siRNA group (lanes 1–4), suggesting a role of OGT1 in regulating the stabilization of NSL3 in a post-translational manner. Because NSL3 can be O-GlcNAcylated by OGT1, we hypothesized that the stabilizing function of OGT1 on NSL3 might be associated with its O-GlcNAcylation of NSL3. To address this hypothesis, point mutants of OGT1 (OGT1G598A and OGT1C964A) were expressed and purified from insect cells (Fig. 6A, left). The enzyme activity of both OGT1G598A and OGT1C964A was then tested using in vitro O-GlcNAc transferase assays. Compared with wild-type OGT1 (OGT1-WT) (lanes 3 and 4), no signals were detected in point mutant of OGT1 (OGT1mt) lanes by Western blotting with anti-GlcNAc antibody, suggesting that both OGT1G598A and OGT1C964A mutants lost the enzyme activity (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 6). To further confirm whether the catalytically dead mutants abolish the interaction between OGT1 and NSL3, OGT1G598A and OGT1C964A mutants were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector. Protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. 6C). Then Myc-tagged OGT1C964A was used in co-transfection/IP experiments. As shown in Fig. 6D, although OGT1C964A lost the enzyme activity, like OGT1-WT, OGT1C964A also interacted with NSL3 (lane 5, Flag IP/IB: Myc). However, the ability to stabilize NSL3 was obviously decreased because the expression level of OGT1C964A relative to OGT1-WT was significantly higher (Input/IB: Myc). To further investigate whether OGT1C964A affects the stability of NSL3 protein, increasing amounts of OGT1-WT or OGT1C964A were co-transfected with 1.2 μg of NSL3 with or without CHX treatment. Clearly, the NSL3 was stabilized by OGT1-WT (Fig. 6E, lanes 2 and 3) but not by OGT1C964A (Fig. 6E, lanes 5 and 6) in cells. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism of O-GlcNAcylation of OGT1 is involved in stabilizing NSL3. Because both OGT1 and NSL3 are subunits of the NSL complex, it is necessary to know whether OGT1 regulates the enzyme activity of the NSL complex through stabilization of NSL3. To gain a clear idea of the functions of OGT1 in the NSL complex, the coordination of OGT1 and NSL3 in global histone H4K16ac was investigated. At first, knockdown of either OGT1 or NSL3 with siRNA in 293T (Fig. 7A) or HeLa (Fig. 7B) cells significantly decreased global H4K16ac in a dose-dependent manner. However, overexpression of OGT1-WT (Fig. 7C), but not OGT1C964A (Fig. 7D), in NSL3 knockdown 293T cells restored the global H4K16ac to normal levels (Fig. 7, C, row 5, and D, row 5). Interestingly, although overexpression of OGT1 in 293T cells dramatically increased global H4K16ac (Fig. 7E, lower), reduction or lesser changes of global H4K16ac were observed in NSL3-overexpressing cells (Fig. 7E, upper), and this reduction was more obvious in OGT1 knockdown 293T cells (Fig. 7F, lanes 3 and 4, row 5), suggesting the importance of the O-GlcNAcylation of NSL3 in regulating global H4K16ac in cells. Although both hMOF-containing HAT MSL and NSL complexes can acetylate H4 Lys-16 (21Smith E.R. Cayrou C. Huang R. Lane W.S. Côté J. Lucchesi J.C.

Therefore, to further clarify the coordination of OGT1 and NSL3 in regulating the global H4K16ac, H4K5ac, and H4K8ac, co-transfection of NSL3 and OGT1-WT or OGT1C964A was carried out. As shown in Fig. 8, 1.2 μg of NSL3 was co-transfected with increasing amounts of OGT1-WT or OGT1C964A in the presence or absence of CHX (3 μg/ml). OGT1-WT significantly increased global H4K16ac and H4K5ac in cells with or without CHX. Although the changes of H4K8ac were not obvious in co-transfection of NSL3 and OGT1-WT in the absence of CHX, the global H4K8ac was dose-dependently raised in CHX-exposed cells (Fig. 8A, right panel). However, no obvious increase in NSL3 and no dose-dependent increase in H4K16ac, H4K5ac, or H4K8ac were observed in cells after co-transfection of NSL3 and OGT1C964A in the absence or presence of CHX (3 μg/ml) (Fig. 8B).

Antagomir studies suggest an implication of miR-132 in the functionality of the mammalian circadian clock. miR-212 and miR-132 are tandemly processed from the same transcript and share the same seed region. We found the clock modulator miR-132 and miR-212 to be expressed rhythmically in the central circadian clock. Consequently, mRNAs implicated in circadian functions may likely be targeted by both miRs. To further characterize the circadian role we generated mice with stable deletion of the miR-132/212 locus and compared the circadian behavior of mutant and wild-type control animals on two genetic backgrounds frequently used in chronobiological research, C57BL/6N and 129/Sv. Surprisingly, the wheel-running activity phenotype of miR mutant mice was highly background specific. A prolonged circadian free-running period in constant darkness was found in 129/Sv, but not in C57BL/6N miR-132/212 knockout mice. In contrast, in C57BL/6N, but not in 129/Sv miRNA-132/212 knockout mice a lengthened free-running period was observed in constant light conditions. Furthermore, miR-132/212 knockout mice on 129/Sv background exhibited enhanced photic phase shifts of locomotor activity accompanied by reduced light induction of Period gene transcription in the SCN. This phenotype was absent in miRNA-132/212 knockout mice on a C57BL/6N background. Together, our results reveal a strain and light regimen-specific function of miR-132/212 in the circadian clock machinery suggesting that miR-132 and miR-212 act as background-dependent circadian rhythm modulators."
https://openalex.org/W2608858677,"Phosphate (Pi) limitation is a constraint for plant growth and development in many natural and agricultural ecosystems. In this study, a gene encoding Zea mays L. protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit A, designated ZmPP2AA1, was induced in roots by low Pi availability. The function of the ZmPP2AA1 gene in maize was analyzed using overexpression and RNA interference. ZmPP2AA1 modulated root gravitropism, negatively regulated primary root (PR) growth, and stimulated the development of lateral roots (LRs). A detailed characterization of the root system architecture (RSA) in response to different Pi concentrations with or without indole-3-acetic acid and 1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid revealed that auxin was involved in the RSA response to low Pi availability. Overexpression of ZmPP2AA1 enhanced tolerance to Pi starvation in transgenic maize in hydroponic and soil pot experiments. An increased dry weight (DW), root-to-shoot ratio, and total P content and concentration, along with a delayed and reduced accumulation of anthocyanin in overexpressing transgenic maize plants coincided with their highly branched root system and increased Pi uptake capability under low Pi conditions. Inflorescence development of the ZmPP2AA1 overexpressing line was less affected by low Pi stress, resulting in higher grain yield per plant under Pi deprivation. These data reveal the biological function of ZmPP2AA1, provide insights into a linkage between auxin and low Pi responses, and drive new strategies for the efficient utilization of Pi by maize."

https://openalex.org/W2607936980,"The genus Avena comprises four distinct genomes organized in diploid (AA or CC), tetraploid (AABB or AACC) and hexaploid species (AACCDD), constituting an interesting model for phylogenetic analysis. The aim of this work was to characterize 45S rDNA intergenic spacer (IGS) variability in distinct species representative of Avena genome diversity–A. strigosa (AA), A. ventricosa (CvCv), A. eriantha (CpCp), A. barbata (AABB), A. murphyi (AACC), A. sativa (AACCDD) and A. sterilis (AACCDD) through the assessment of the 5’ external transcribed spacer (5’-ETS), a promising IGS region for phylogenetic studies poorly studied in Avena genus. In this work, IGS length polymorphisms were detected mainly due to distinct 5’-ETS sequence types resulting from major differences in the number and organization of repeated motifs. Although species with A genome revealed a 5’-ETS organization (A-organization) similar to the one previously described in A. sativa, a distinct organization was unraveled in C genome diploid species (C-organization). Interestingly, such new organization presents a higher similarity with other Poaceae species than A-genome sequences, supporting the hypothesis of C-genome being the ancestral Avena genome. Additionally, polyploid species with both genomes mainly retain the A-genome 5’-ETS organization, confirming the preferential elimination of C-genome sequences in Avena polyploid species. Moreover, 5’-ETS sequences phylogenetic analysis consistently clustered the species studied according to ploidy and genomic constitution supporting the use of ribosomal genes to highlight Avena species evolutive pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2622271850,"Local translation of specific mRNAs is regulated by dynamic changes in their subcellular localization, and these changes are due to complex mechanisms controlling cytoplasmic mRNA transport. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is well suited to studying these mechanisms because many of its transcripts are transported from the mother cell to the budding daughter cell. Here, we investigated the translational control of ASH1 mRNA after transport and localization. We show that although ASH1 transcripts were translated after they reached the bud tip, some mRNAs were bound by the RNA-binding protein Puf6 and were non-polysomal. We also found that the DEAD-box helicase Dhh1 complexed with the untranslated ASH1 mRNA and Puf6. Loss of Dhh1 affected local translation of ASH1 mRNA and resulted in delocalization of ASH1 transcript in the bud. Forcibly shifting the non-polysomal ASH1 mRNA into polysomes was associated with Dhh1 dissociation. We further demonstrated that Dhh1 is not recruited to ASH1 mRNA co-transcriptionally, suggesting that it could bind to ASH1 mRNA within the cytoplasm. Of note, Dhh1 bound to the 5′-UTR of ASH1 mRNA and inhibited its translation in vitro. These results suggest that after localization to the bud tip, a portion of the localized ASH1 mRNA becomes translationally inactive because of binding of Dhh1 and Puf6 to the 5′- and 3′-UTRs of ASH1 mRNA."

https://openalex.org/W2607768071,"Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies targeting cell surface or secreted antigens are among the most effective classes of novel immunotherapies. However, the majority of human proteins and established cancer biomarkers are intracellular. Peptides derived from these intracellular proteins are presented on the cell surface by major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) and can be targeted by a novel class of T-cell receptor mimic (TCRm) antibodies that recognise similar epitopes to T-cell receptors. Humoural immune responses to MHC-I tetramers rarely generate TCRm antibodies and many antibodies recognise the α3 domain of MHC-I and β2 microglobulin (β2m) that are not directly involved in presenting the target peptide. Here we describe the production of functional chimeric human-murine HLA-A2-H2Dd tetramers and modifications that increase their bacterial expression and refolding efficiency. These chimeric tetramers were successfully used to generate TCRm antibodies against two epitopes derived from wild type tumour suppressor p53 (RMPEAAPPV and GLAPPQHLIRV) that have been used in vaccination studies. Immunisation with chimeric tetramers yielded no antibodies recognising the human α3 domain and β2m and generated TCRm antibodies capable of specifically recognising the target peptide/MHC-I complex in fully human tetramers and on the cell surface of peptide pulsed T2 cells. Chimeric tetramers represent novel immunogens for TCRm antibody production and may also improve the yield of tetramers for groups using these reagents to monitor CD8 T-cell immune responses in HLA-A2 transgenic mouse models of immunotherapy."

IPK enzymes are classified as a structural subgroup of the protein kinase (PK) family, because they conserve a few features including a fold in two separated lobes (N- and C-lobe) and similar nucleotide recognition mode (22.Cheek S. Zhang H. Grishin N.V. Sequence and structure classification of kinases.J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 855-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In addition, the core of the N-lobe and a few involved in catalysis are conserved. In 2004, the first structure of an IPK was described from IP3 3-K (23.González B. Schell M.J. Letcher A.J.

In summary, the IPK family presents a specific and characteristic fold in the C-lobe different from PKs, having a β-sheet core with helical insertions showing a great range of sizes depending on the IPK class. These helical regions are involved in substrate binding and have been named by us as IP-lobe or CIP-lobe (19.Shears S.B. How versatile are inositol phosphate kinases?.Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, promiscuous IPKs, such as the IP multikinases, have a single helix inserted showing an open active site able to cope with various substrates and products, whereas more specific enzymes as IP3 3-K and IP5 2-K show larger helical scaffolds. In fact, IP5 2-K shows the most elaborated helical region. The full-length structure of IP5 2-K from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtIP5 2-K) is the only one known for this subfamily (25.González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A. Sanz-Aparicio J. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is a distant IPK member with a singular inositide binding site for axial 2-OH recognition.Proc.

It shows the features described above and shows that it is a zinc metallo-enzyme, for which a structural role has been proposed (25.González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A.

The structure of AtIP5 2-K was an important advance for this field, but nevertheless, the specific features of mammal IP5 2-K remain unknown. The IP5 2-K family shows moderate sequence conservation across the species. In particular, mammalian enzymes show different insertions and do not conserve the zinc site found in the plant enzyme, making it difficult to obtain a good sequence alignment. From its sequence motifs, putative zinc-binding residues have been proposed in human IP5 2-K (13.Brehm M.A. Schenk T.M. Zhou X. Fanick W. Lin H. Windhorst S. Nalaskowski M.M. Kobras M. Shears S.B. Mayr G.W. Intracellular localization of human Ins(1,3,4,5,6)P5 2-kinase.Biochem. J. 2007; 408: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, if mammal IP5 2-K is a zinc metallo-enzyme, the putative role for this metal awaits further studies. Because of the significance of IP5 2-K to proper cell functioning and the many roles of its product IP6, it is important to understand the molecular basis that underlies this enzyme function. In this work, we have determined the mouse IP5 2-K structure in the presence of inositide showing that although this enzyme conserves features with the plant enzyme, it differs significantly in many aspects. Our results define the specific features of mammal IP5 2-Ks. In addition, we present here valuable information that could help in understanding IP5 2-K functions beyond its catalytic activity as its role in ribosomal RNA synthesis (12.Brehm M.A. Wundenberg T.

We have solved the structure of Mus musculus IP5 2-K (mIP5 2-K) at 2.4 Å resolution (Table 1) from a truncated form lacking the 21 C-terminal residues (ΔC-mIP5 2-K). Noticeably, mIP5 2-K crystals were not obtained in the absence of the inositide. The structure for mIP5 2-K in the presence of one or both ligands, forming binary complexes (IP6) or ternary complexes (IP5 + ATP), is presented (supplemental Fig. S1). In addition, we present two different crystal forms, including one or two molecules in the asymmetric unit, respectively, the first showing much better resolution (2.4 versus 3.2 Å).

Open table in a new tab Mouse IP5 2-K folds in two lobes, N- and C-terminal lobes, connected by a hinge, thereby conserving the general fold scheme of PKs and IPKs, and in a similar way, both lobes coordinate the nucleotide between them (Fig. 1A). The N-lobe core forms a β-sheet formed by five antiparallel β-strands (β1–β5) showing two helical segments. The first helical segment (N-I) harbors α1, equivalent to the helix αC characterized in all protein kinases, whereas the second one (N-II) is a specific insertion different in every IPK subfamily. A role of this region for substrate binding in the IP5 2-K subfamily has been previously reported by others (29.Gosein V. Miller G.J. Conformational stability of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (IPK1) dictates its substrate selectivity.J. Biol.

Three helical segments are inserted in the β-sheet core. These segments altogether form a large helical ensemble named the CIP lobe in the structure of AtIP5 2-K (25.González B. Baños-Sanz J.I. Villate M. Brearley C.A. Sanz-Aparicio J. Inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is a distant IPK member with a singular inositide binding site for axial 2-OH recognition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9608-9613Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and each of them is consequently named as CIPI, CIPII, and CIPIII. The CIP lobe represents more than half of the protein and is specific to IP5 2-K enzymes. It creates a scaffold that builds up most of the inositide substrate-binding site. The five loops (CL1–CL5) joining the CIP region to the C-lobe β-sheet core are essential because they play a key role in substrate binding and catalysis (Figs. 1B and 2).Figure 2Substrate recognition by mIP5 2-K.

D, zoom showing inositide and nucleotide interaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A general view of IP5 2-K substrate recognition is shown in Fig. 2A and detailed in supplemental Table S1. The adenine is strongly recognized through polar and hydrophobic interactions with both protein lobes and the hinge connecting them (Fig. 2B). In particular, it forms polar interactions with His-14 and the backbones of Pro-116 and Leu-118. The ribose OHs interact with the C-lobe residues Glu-136 and Arg-209. The triphosphate moiety is tightly bound to the N-lobe of the enzyme through polar interactions and to the C-lobe through two magnesium ions. In particular, phosphate interaction with residue Arg-33, with a flexible loop (G-loop, residues Gly-15–Ser-20) and with an acidic residue (Asp-437) through the magnesium ions, is conserved throughout the PK superfamily and is essential for nucleotide binding and kinase activity. Regarding the inositide substrate, IP5 is tightly bound to the enzyme through its five phosphates (Fig. 2C). A total of 14 residues coordinate the phosphate groups, two of them through water molecules and eight of them being lysine or arginine. P1 and P3 are coordinated by both lobes, whereas P4 and P5 are coordinated exclusively by the C-lobe. Residues from the N-lobe involved in P1 and P3 binding come from the segment N-II (Arg-100) and the G-loop (Asn-18 and Lys-19) mentioned above. Residues from the C-lobe involved in coordination of the five phosphates come from the CIP lobe and its CLs. Fig. 2C and supplemental Table S1 show all the polar interactions produced with the inositide phosphates (P1: Asn-18, Arg-100, Lys-138, Lys-173, and Asn-206; P3: Asn-18, Lys-19, and Lys-441; P4: Gln-449; P5: with Lys-140, Arg-160, and His-164 through water molecules; and P6: Lys-138, Lys-140, Lys-168, Asn-206, and water mediated with Asn-207). The tight and extensive recognition explains the high specificity of this enzyme. Human IP5 2-K displays a 0.43 μm Km value for IP5 (31.Verbsky J.W. Wilson M.P. Kisseleva M.V. Majerus P.W. Wente S.R. The synthesis of inositol hexakisphosphate. Characterization of human inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31857-31862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) in good agreement with the value obtained for mIP5 2-K by us (0.29 μm) (Fig. 3A) and in contrast with the low tens of micromolar values reported for the AtIP5 2-K (22 μm) (32.Sweetman D. Johnson S. Caddick S.E. Hanke D.E. Brearley C.A. Characterization of an Arabidopsis inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase (AtIPK1).Biochem. J. 2006; 394: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A possible explanation for the different Km values found in the plant enzyme might be related to some differences found in enzymes from both kingdoms either in the inositide recognition mode or in the constraints introduced by the zinc-binding site (see below). Six residues from the CLs form the interface of substrate recognition, generating a net of interactions, including the magnesium ions (Fig. 2D). Residues Lys-138 and Asp-400 make direct interaction with Pγ and/or the nucleophile 2-OH. The distance between the 2-OH and Pγ oxygen is 3.2 Å suggesting an in-line transference mechanism probably in agreement with an associative mechanism. Pγ is oriented through a magnesium ion (Mg1) coordinated to Asp-437 and to Asp-439 in a second sphere. Asp-437 also coordinates a second magnesium ion (Mg2) together with Ser-402 through a water molecule. Comparison of the ternary and binary complexes (IP5 2-K/IP5/ATP versus IP5 2-K/IP6) shows that there is no significant structural variation among them (r.m.s.d. is 0.377 Å for 403 Cα atoms). The IP6 shows similar interactions, with P2 remaining at the substrate interface regions described above. A BLAST search using mIP5 2-K sequence and limited to mammals (taxid: 40674) shows that all residues coordinating the nucleotide and inositide are absolutely conserved, with just a couple of residues showing a conservative change in some species. Unexpectedly, the formation of the ternary complex (mIP5 2-K + IP5 + ATP) was achieved by protein incubation with IP6 and ADP (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, we checked that our crystallized mIP5 2-K samples are able to catalyze both the forward (Fig. 3B) and reverse (Fig. 3C) reactions in solution. In agreement, the plant enzyme is highly reversible with an equilibrium constant in the forward “kinase” direction of ∼14 (20.Phillippy B.Q. Ullah A.H. Ehrlich K.C. Purification and some properties of inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 2-kinase from immature soybean seeds.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28393-28399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By ion-pair reverse-phase HPLC, we were also able to confirm the production of ATP from IP6 and ADP (data not shown). mIP5 2-K presents two zinc ions in its structure, one in the CIP-lobe (Zn1) and the other close to the hinge region (Zn2) (Figure 1, Figure 4). In fact, Zn1 is present in all the crystals obtained, whereas Zn2 was only detected in the low resolution ΔC-mIP5 2-K crystals in which the two molecules in the asymmetric unit interact through the hinge region probably fixing a conformation captured by crystallography (supplemental Fig. S2). The Zn1 site is formed by residues from two CIP lobe elements: Cys-159, Cys-162, and Cys-181 from CIP-I and Cys-291 from CIP-II (Fig. 4A). This site presents the typical zinc geometry and coordination, although it has no homologues in the structural databases using the DALI server (33.Holm L. Rosenström P. Dali server: conservation mapping in 3D.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: W545-W549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3064) Google Scholar). The two first cysteines from CIP-I are located in a helix, separated by two residues, and could resemble a partial zinc-finger; however, the fourth ligand breaks any resemblance because it comes from a position very distant in sequence. In fact, Cys-291 comes from a very long loop inserted into two helices that cross over the back of the CIP-lobe (Fig. 5). We have selected Cys-181 and Cys-291 as candidates for the mutagenic study (Fig. 4C). However, there was no expression of the C181S mIP5 2-K mutant in the conditions reported herein for the wild-type protein. This suggests that the Zn1 site formation could be essential for proper protein folding. By contrast, C291S mIP5 2-K mutant expression levels are in the same order as the wild type, being only 2-fold decreased. Despite this, the impact of this mutation on enzyme activity is very high, because the mutated sample retains less than 10% of enzyme activity (Fig. 4C). In this line, it is worth mentioning that the two first cysteines of this zinc site are in helix α4, an element that provides four residues for the inositide substrate binding (Fig. 2A). We also consider that this fact could have some effect in obtaining a lower Km value for the substrate in mIP5 2-K. Regarding Zn2, it is created by two residues from the hinge (His-125 and His-129) and one residue from the C-lobe (Cys-410) (Fig. 4B). Mutation of residues His-129 and Cys-410 to serine produces samples with a moderate decrease in enzymatic activity revealing that Zn2 is not critical for protein function (Fig. 4C). A possible explanation for the greater decrease found in the H129S mutant could be its key location in the hinge, an element important for enzyme flexibility. We have subsequently evaluated the metal content in mIP5 2-K samples by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Fig. 4D). We confirmed that mIP5 2-K is a zinc metalloenzyme (supplemental Table S2). Unexpectedly, wild-type samples purified as LSLt-tagged protein exhibit a zinc/protein molar ratio of 0.6:1. An insufficient supply of zinc could also explain the difficulties encountered in the crystallization process of this enzyme due to structural inhomogeneity. However, attempts to add zinc from different salts to the crystallization drops failed because the protein precipitated. We found a zinc/protein molar ratio of 0.8:1, 0.4:1, and 0.7:1 for H129S, C291S, and C410S, mutants, respectively. As expected, mutation on residue Cys-291 (Zn1 site) yields an enzyme with less zinc content than the wild type (Fig. 4D and supplemental Table S2). By contrast, mutation of Zn2-coordinating residues (His-129 and Cys-410) yields samples with no reduction in the zinc content (Fig. 4D and supplemental Table S2). Therefore, we further analyzed the fe"

https://openalex.org/W2609928507,"Bis-dehydroxycurcumin tert-butyl ester (K2T23) is a derivative of the natural spice curcumin. Curcumin is widely studied for its multiple therapeutic properties, including photosensitized cytotoxicity. However, the full exploitation of curcumin phototoxic potential is hindered by the extreme instability of its excited state, caused by very efficient non radiative decay by means of transfer of the enolic proton to the nearby keto oxygen. K2T23 is designed to exhibit a tautomeric equilibrium shifted toward the diketo conformers with respect to natural curcumin. This property should endow K2T23 with superior excited-state stability when excited in the UVB band, i.e., in correspondence of the diketo conformers absorption peaks, making this compound an interesting candidate for topical photodynamic therapy of, e.g., skin tumors or oral infections. In this work, the tautomeric equilibrium of K2T23 between the keto-enolic and diketo conformers is assessed in the ground state in several organic solvents by UV-visible absorption and by nuclear magnetic resonance. The same tautomeric equilibrium is also probed in the excited-state in the same environments by means of steady-state fluorescence and time-correlated single-photon counting measurements. These techniques are also exploited to elucidate the excited state dynamics and excited-state deactivation pathways of K2T23, which are compared to those determined for several other curcuminoids characterized in previous works of ours. The ability of K2T23 in photosensitizing the production of singlet oxygen is compared with that of curcumin."

One of the most important consequences of global warming is sea level rise, and better determining how fast it is occurring is vital for understanding the climate system and formulating adaptive policy. Dieng et al. used 26 separate data sets to determine global mean sea level (GMSL) since October 1992, when satellite altimetry measurements of sea levels began. They find that although the average rate of GMSL rise between January 1993 and December 2015 was close to 3.0 mm/year, the rate was 0.8 mm/year higher during the period 2004–2015 than it was during 1993–2004. Most of that increase was due to mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, but all other components of the budget contributed as well.
