https://openalex.org/W2030831143,"The structure of present-day ferredoxin, with its simple, inorganic active site and its functions basic to photon-energy utilization, suggests the incorporation of its prototype into metabolism very early during biochemical evolution, even before complex proteins and the complete modern genetic code existed. The information in the amino acid sequence of ferredoxin enables us to propose a detailed reconstruction of its evolutionary history. Ferredoxin has evolved by doubling a shorter protein, which may have contained only eight of the simplest amino acids. This shorter ancestor in turn developed from a repeating sequence of the amino acids alanine, aspartic acid or proline, serine, and glycine. We explain the persistence of living relics of this primordial structure by invoking a conservative principle in evolutionary biochemistry: The processes of natural selection severely inhibit any change a well-adapted system on which several other essential components depend."
https://openalex.org/W2093541224,"The temperature at which the interstitial water was squeezed from a marine sediment had a profound effect on the measured interstitial silica concentrations which showed an average increase of 51 percent after the sediment was exposed to a temperature 20 degrees C higher than the in situ temperature. Similar effects were not found for interstitial phosphate or alkalinity, but the pH was slightly higher in the water squeezed at the higher temperature. These tempreature-induced changes were completed in a few hours. The use of filter paper can significantly lower the pH of expressed pore waters. Until some important questions about temperature effects are answered, all future data on the pH and silica concentration of pore waters of marine sediments should be obtained from samples extracted at in situ temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W2015692764,"Events occurring after infection of bacteria with wild-type and a temperature-sensitive mutant phage indicate that there are two enzymatic activities necessary to replicate phage RNA. One converts single strands into double strands, while the other uses double strands to synthesize viral RNA. The mutant is deficient in the first activity, probably because the mutation is in the gene specifying the requisite enzyme. On the basis of these and other results, a model is presented for the replication of phage RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2053957600,"The presence of all five enzymes of the ornithine-urea cycle has been demonstrated in the liver of the African lungfish Protopterus aethiopicus. Levels of activity of the rate-limiting enzymes, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and argininosuccinate synthetase, are similar to those in the premetamorphic tadpole of Rana catesbeiana and considerably lower than the levels reported for other ureotelic animals. They are thus consistent with the predominantly ammonotelic metabolism of the lungfish in an aquatic environment."
https://openalex.org/W2068363548,"The action of erythropoietin on the pool of undifferentiated bone marrow cells has been examined with the aid of a model tested with an analog computer. The model is consistent with reported experimental results. The essential aspects of the action are (i) the effect is exerted during the S phase of the cell's cycle; (ii) "" effective "" erythropoietin is present in the cell only during G(1) and part of S; and, (iii) hormone molecules survive in the cell for only a limited time in effective form and require a certain time to assume this form."
https://openalex.org/W2047858473,"The histochemical localization of glucose-6-phosphatase activity in neonatal mouse liver was studied under electron microscopy. The activity was demonstrated in the tubular endoplasmic reticulum, which pervades the glycogen areas of the cell during glycogenolysis. Activity was also demonstrated in the nuclear envelope and ergastoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2066245567,"Blood pressure was telemetered from transducers chronically implanted in the carotid arteries of two adult, wild, male giraffes captured and released near Kiboko, Kenya. Cerebral perfusion pressure ranged from 280/180 mm-Hg while the animal was lying with its head on the ground to 125/75 mm-Hg when it was standing erect; it varied between these levels during spontaneous activity such as walking, grazing, and running."
https://openalex.org/W2084213816,"The structure of nitrosonium octafluoroxenate(VI), 2NOF . XeF(6), has been determined by means of single-crystal x-ray counter methods (R-index = 0.046, weighted R-index = 0.042). The space group is Pnma, with a = 8.914(10) angstroms, b = 5.945(10) angstroms, and c = 12.83(2) angstroms (the numbers in parentheses are the standard deviations to the least significant digit or digits); the calculated density (rho) is 3.354 grams per cubic centimeter, and there are four formula units per unit cell. The material consists of well-separated NO(+) and (XeF(8))(2-) ions; the structural formula is thus (NO)(2) (XeF(8)). The anion configuration is that of a slightly distorted Archimedean antiprism. The observed distortion appears incompatible with a lone-pair repulsion model. Xenon-fluorine bond lengths of 1.971(7), 1.946(5), 1.958(7), 2.052(5), and 2.099(5) angstroms were found."
https://openalex.org/W2093755038,"Xenon undergoes reaction with protonated methyl fluoride in the gas phase to form abundant quantities of the stable methyl xenonium ion, CH(3)Xe(+). Estimated values for the xenon-carbon and krypton-carbon bond strengths in the rare gas-methyl molecular ions are 43 +/- 8 and 21 +/- 15 kilocalories per mole, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1991498128,"Microearthquakes were monitored by a network of seismographs located on Amchitka and nearby islands; the nature of earthquake activity in this region was found to be consistent with the hypothesis of underthrusting of the Aleutian arc by a rigid lithospheric plate. Seismic effects of the nuclear explosion Milrow were small, of short duration, confined to the region immediate to the explosion, and were apparently independent of this geotectonic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2075205262,Gibberellic acid solutions supplied through micropipettes to explants from dormant branches of white pine (Pinus strobus L.) stimulate changes in the cambial zone. Immature sieve cells expand radially and exhibit cytological changes usually associated with spring maturation. Diflerentiation of sieve cells continues in response to treatment and is recognized by the birefringence of secondary walls when examined with the polarizing microscope.

By sequential illumnination of the columns, the pattern was made to appear to rotate. Optokinetic nystagmus was clearly evoked in 64.7 percent of the subjects, with a weak-positive response in an additional 11.8 percent."
https://openalex.org/W1978551097,"Ribosomal subunits were prepared by means of the Anderson zonal ultracentrifuge. With this technique it is possible to separate more than 300 milligrams of subunits with complete resolution in a single run, as compared with about 2 milligrams with conventional rotors. Superior resolution is achieved in the zonal ultracentrifuge, affording possibilities for the detection and preparation of minor ribosomal components."

https://openalex.org/W2017144766,"Crystallization ages for six rocks from Fra Mauro have been measured by the argon-40-argon-39 method. All six rocks give an age of 3.77 +/- 0.15 x 10(9) years, which is the same as for fragmental rocks from this site. It is concluded that the Imbrium event and the crystallization of a significant portion of the pre-Imbrian basalts were essentially contemporaneous."
https://openalex.org/W1983394466,Significant amounts of adrenocorticotrophin-releasing hormone appear in the peripheral blood under conditions of physiological stress. Associated with the appearance of this neurohormone is an increased antidiuretic activity. The neurohormone presumably enters the general circulation by way of the portal vessels of the anterior pituitary gland.
https://openalex.org/W1989174594,"The scientific advisory system is effective on limited technical questions, and such questions provide much of its work. On broad technical questions, however, the scientific advisory system is not effective. Unfortunately this category includes most of the crucial environmental questions. Finally, the advisory system, as presently constituted, combined with the multiple functions of the scientific establishment, is detrimental in important ways to the process of technical decision-making in this country. This is because the combined effect of the advisory system and the establishment is to impede the development of a more effective and comprehensive role for the scientific community in the technical decision-making process."

https://openalex.org/W2078720863,"A deficiency of the normally prominent alkaline phosphatase zone (by starch-gel electrophoresis) has been discovered in a newly investigated laboratory strain of Drosophila melonogaster. Mating experiments indicate that genetic control is by an allele of a previously described electrophoretic variation. Heterozygotes resulting from crosses of the deficient type and the fast electrophoretic variant show only the fast phenotype. In deficient × slow heterozygotes, however, there is a new band that does not correspond in electrophoretic mobility with any of the bands of other heterozygous or homozygous types. It is suggested that the allele responsible for the deficiency leads to the manufacture of an inactive subunit that is able to hybridize with the subunits of the slow electrophoretic form."
https://openalex.org/W1966308362,"For pottery sherds from an arid region, the ratio of natural thermoluminescence to thermoluminescence induced by a standard dose of radiation corresponds closely to the independently assessed archeologic age. Difficulties in age determination, because of variations among sherds, are reduced by averaging results for samples from the same time period."
https://openalex.org/W2062018361,"Postpartum involution of the uterus was significantly reduced in rabbits by immediate and repeated injections of progesterone. Progesterone had no effect if the injections commenced 24 hours after delivery. The decrease in concentration of progesterone that accompanies birth results in release of proteolytic and other degradative enzymes from subcellular particles; these enzymes cause the involution, and, once the enzymes are released into the cellular milieu, progesterone has no effect."
https://openalex.org/W2011721745,Diurnal solar heating produces an unstable warm zone just off the bottom of the inshore regions of a salt lake. The warm water rises in plumes in which brine shrimp become entrapped through apparently negative photokinetic behavior. The plumes of concentrated shrimp resemble those composed of insects in air.
https://openalex.org/W2001329705,"An asymmetric initial boundary is often formed when a synthetic boundary cell is used in the analytical ultracentrifuge. Model calculations show that, when such a boundary diffuses, the peak of the corresponding gradient pattern moves. The movement of the peak resulting from diffusion, when superimposed on the sedimentation of the boundary, may produce errors in the measurement of the sedimentation coefficient."
https://openalex.org/W2059066199,"In some dogs there are preganglionic fibers leaving the cervical spinal cord through the ventral roots of the lower cervical nerves. When these fibers are stimulated electrically in the anesthetized dog with skeletal muscle paralysis (induced by decamethonium), the effects are vasoconstriction in the front footpad, cardiac acceleration and augmentation, and a rise in arterial blood pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2066239839,"Studies of the metachronal rhythms of Artemia salina reveal that limb movements of the male and female are synchronous during precopulatory coupling. Synchrony is an adaptation which maintains efficiency in locomotion, respiration, and feeding. The male acts as the pacemaker for the pair and drives the female at a higher rate than she exhibits when alone."
