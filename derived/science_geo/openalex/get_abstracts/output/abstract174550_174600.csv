Here we show that hippocampal lesions produce a severe and selective impairment in the capacity of rats to remember the sequential ordering of a series of odors, despite an intact capacity to recognize odors that recently occurred. These findings support the hypothesis that hippocampal networks mediate associations between sequential events that constitute elements of an episodic memory."

In vivo interactions of biglycan and fibromodulin, two SLRPs highly expressed in tendons and bones, were investigated by generating biglycan/fibromodulin double-deficient mice. Here we show that collagen fibrils in tendons from mice deficient in biglycan and/or fibromodulin are structurally and mechanically altered resulting in unstable joints. As a result, the mice develop successively and progressively 1) gait impairment, 2) ectopic tendon ossification, and 3) severe premature osteoarthritis. Forced use of the joints increases ectopic ossification and osteoarthritis in the double-deficient mice, further indicating that structurally weak tendons cause the phenotype. The study shows that mutations in SLRPs may predispose to osteoarthritis and offers a valuable and unique animal model for spontaneous osteoarthritis characterized by early onset and a rapid progression of the disease."

We demonstrated previously that HLA-B27 heavy chains (HC) undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation. We report here that HLA-B27 HC also forms two types of aberrant disulfide-linked complexes (dimers) during the folding and assembly process that can be distinguished by conformation-sensitive antibodies W6/32 and HC10. HC10-reactive dimers form immediately after HC synthesis in the ER and constitute at least 25% of the HC pool, whereas W6/32-reactive dimers appear several hours later and represent less than 10% of the folded HC. HC10-reactive dimers accumulate in the absence of tapasin or β2-microglobulin, whereas W6/32-reactive dimers are not detected. Efficient formation of W6/32-reactive dimers appears to depend on the transporter associated with antigen processing, tapasin, and β2-microglobulin. The unpaired Cys67 and residues at the base of the B pocket that dramatically impair HLA-B27 HC folding are critical for the formation of HC10-reactive ER dimers. Although certain other alleles also form dimers late in the assembly pathway, ER dimerization of HLA-B27 may be unique. These results demonstrate that residues comprising the HLA-B27 B pocket result in aberrant HC folding and disulfide bond formation, and thus confer unusual properties on this molecule that are unrelated to peptide selection per se, yet may be important in disease pathogenesis.

Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). For major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I complexes, newly synthesized unfolded heavy chains (HC) bind to calnexin, with subsequent folding, release, and calreticulin binding coincident with β2-microglobulin (β2m) association (2Cresswell P. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 172: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Further retention of partially folded HC/β2m heterodimers is mediated by tapasin, an MHC class I-specific chaperone which forms a bridge between HC and TAP (transporter associated with antigen processing) in the peptide loading complex. Tapasin-mediated retention serves to optimize peptide loading and thus stability, so that complexes can traffic to the cell surface and display peptides without dissociating prematurely. An important component of HC folding and assembly is the formation of correct intrachain disulfide bonds (3Cresswell P. Arunachalam B. Bangia N. Dick T. Diedrich G. Hughes E. Maric M. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 191-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), as evidenced by mutations in critical Cys residues that interfere with class I expression and antigen presentation (4Warburton R.J. Matsui M. Rowland-Jones S.L. Gammon M.C. Katzenstein G.E. Wei T. Edidin M. Zweerink H.J. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Hum. Immunol. 1994; 39: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). For MHC class I proteins this appears to be mediated by ERp57, a thiol oxidoreductase that catalyzes disulfide bond formation and rearrangement. ERp57 has been found associated with calnexin and calreticulin (5Oliver J.D. Roderick H.L. Llewellyn D.H. High S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2573-2582Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and is also part of the peptide-loading complex (6Hughes E.A. Cresswell P. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 709-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lindquist J.A. Jensen O.N. Mann M. Hammerling G.J.

Biol. 1998; 8: 713-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) where it is linked to tapasin via a disulfide bond (9Dick T. Bangia N. Peaper D.R. Cresswell P. Immunity. 2002; 16: 87-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). When class I HC are synthesized in the absence of β2m or peptide, they misfold and are dislocated from the ER into the cytosol where they are degraded in a process known as ER-associated degradation (10Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). When certain mouse class I alleles are expressed in β2m-deficient cells, misfolding is associated with the formation of HC-HC homodimers in the ER via an unpaired Cys in the cytoplasmic tail (11Capps G.G. Robinson B.E. Lewis K.D. Zuniga M.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies HC dimerization was also observed in cells expressing β2m, but only after β2m had dissociated from previously assembled complexes. This led to the suggestion that HC dimerization might be a mechanism by which dysfunctional molecules are removed (11Capps G.G. Robinson B.E. Lewis K.D. Zuniga M.C. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). HLA-B27 is an unusual allele in that it misfolds even in the presence of a normal supply of β2m and peptide (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.-G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). This characteristic is related to the composition of its B pocket, a region of the peptide-binding groove that plays a dominant role in peptide selection (13Jardetzky T.S. Lane W.S. Robinson R.A. Madden D.R. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1991; 353: 326-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, 14Colbert R.A. Rowland-Jones S.L. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but also has a dramatic influence on HC folding rate (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.-G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). The rim of the B pocket also contains an unpaired and reactive Cys residue (Cys67) (15Whelan M.A. Archer J.R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 3278-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Weiss G.A. Valentekovich R.J. Collins E.J. Garboczi D.N. Lane W.S. Schreiber S.L. Wiley D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10945-10948Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), which is relatively uncommon among MHC class I alleles (HLA-B27, -B38, -B39, -B14, -B15, and B73) (17Kostyu D.D. Hannick L.I. Traweek J.L. Ghanayem M. Heilpern D. Dawson D.V. Hum. Immunol. 1997; 57: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cys67 appears to allow HLA-B27 HC to dimerize when they are refolded in vitro in the absence of β2m, a phenomenon that was also observed in TAP-deficient T2 cells expressing HLA-B27 (18Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar). This residue also has an important affect on the stability of HLA-B27 HC·peptide·β2m complexes (19Reinelt S. Dedier S. Asuni G. Folkers G. Rognan D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18472-18477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These findings have been of interest particularly because HLA-B27 is highly associated with susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis and other human spondyloarthropathies (20Khan A. Calin A. Taurog J.D. The Spondyloarthritides. Oxford University Press, Oxford1998: 17-26Google Scholar), and can cause spondyloarthropathy-like inflammatory conditions when overexpressed in rodents (21Taurog J.D. Maika S.D. Satumtira N. Dorris M.L. McLean I.L. Yanagisawa H. Sayad A. Stagg A.J. Fox G.M. O'Brien A.L. Rehman M. Zhou M. Weiner A.L. Splawski J.B. Richardson J.A. Hammer R.E. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 169: 209-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 22Khare S.D. Luthra H.S. David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain these findings, but as yet the mechanism is unclear. Whereas arthritogenic peptide presentation has been suspected for some time, there is limited support for this hypothesis (23Parham P. Immunol. Rev. 1996; 154: 137-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and in instances where autoreactivity has been found, it is not clear whether this is either specific for, or initiated by, HLA-B27 (24Fiorillo M.T. Maragno M. Butler R. Dupuis M.L. Sorrentino R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 25Hermann E., Yu, D.T.Y. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.-H. Fleischer B. Lancet. 1993; 342: 646-650Abstract PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In HLA-B27 transgenic mice, spontaneous arthritis develops in the absence of β2m (22Khare S.D. Luthra H.S. David C.S. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1153-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), indicating that cell surface expression of “classical,” trimeric HLA-B27 HC·peptide·β2m complexes is not required. Interestingly, the same spontaneous arthritis phenotype has been reported in the absence of HLA-B27, in either β2m or TAP-deficient mice with a mixed genetic background (26Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Witte D.P. Taurog J.D. Roopenian D.C. Colbert R.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2290-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). These studies raise the possibility that class I HC misfolding in general, and intracellular sequelae might be a critical component of the disease mechanism, perhaps through the generation of ER stress (27Colbert R.A. Mol. Med. Today. 2000; 6: 224-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Along these lines, effects of HLA-B27 expression in monocytes and epithelial cells that cannot be explained by its function as an antigen presenting molecule have been described (28Laitio P. Virtala M. Salmi M. Pelliniemi L.J., Yu, D.T. Granfors K. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1331-1338Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 29Virtala M. Kirveskari J. Granfors K. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2436-4242Crossref Google Scholar, 30Ikawa T. Ikeda M. Yamaguchi A. Tsai W.C. Tamura N. Seta N. Trucksess M. Raybourne R.B. Yu D.T.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Other ideas focusing on T cell recognition of dimers as aberrant structures have also been proposed (31Edwards J.C.W. Bowness P. Archer J.R. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 256-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 32Boyle L.H. Goodall J.C. Opat S.S. Gaston J.S.H. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 2619-2624Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These observations raise several questions, in particular whether HLA-B27 dimerization occurs in cells with an intact antigen presentation pathway and is related to events occurring in the ER. The results presented here indicate that aberrant disulfide-linked HLA-B27 HC include both “folded” and “unfolded” structures based on differential recognition by W6/32 and HC10. Dimerization of HC in the ER requires Cys67 as well as other B pocket residues that contribute to their prolonged retention. Our studies emphasize abnormalities in the folding of HLA-B27 that may be unique to this allele, and could be involved in the pathogenesis of spondyloarthropathies. B27.A23 and B27.E45M were constructed from a genomic clone of HLA-B*2705 by site-directed mutagenesis (Altered Sites, Promega, Madison, WI). B27.A23 has three amino acid substitutions: H9F (F for H at position 9), T24A, and E45M. B27.C67A was kindly provided by Joel Taurog, and was also produced from genomic HLA-B*2705. B27.A2B contains six amino acid substitutions (H9F, T24A, E45M, I66K, C67V, and K70H) and has been described previously (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.-G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar, 14Colbert R.A. Rowland-Jones S.L. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The tapasin cDNA was also made by reverse transcriptase-PCR using oligonucleotides designed from the published sequence (33Ortmann B. Copeman J. Lehner P.J. Sadasivan B. Herberg J.A. Grandea A.G. Riddell S.R. Tampe R. Spies T. Trowsdale J. Cresswell P. Science. 1997; 277: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and is the allele with Thr at position 240 of the mature protein (34Copeman J. Bangia N. Cross J.C. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HMy2.C1R (C1R) are HLA-A negative and -B35 low human B-lymphoblastoid cells (35Zemmour J. Little A.-M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar), and 0.174 X CEMR (T2) are T-B lymphoblastoid hybrid cells that are missing a large region of the MHC, including the genes encoding TAP1 and TAP2 (36Salter R.D. Howell D.M. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1985; 21: 235-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). T2 synthesize HC for HLA-A2, -B5, and -Cw1. T5-1 is a B cell line expressing HLA-A1, -A2, -B8, -B27, and -Cw4 (37Pious D. Soderland C. Gladstone P. Immunogenetics. 1977; 4: 437-448Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 721.220 (.220) are HLA class I- and tapasin deficient, although they express one C allele and low levels of a truncated tapasin molecule (34Copeman J. Bangia N. Cross J.C. Cresswell P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HF and BL are B-lymphoblastoid cell lines. HF express HLA-A2, -A3, -B7, -B27, and BL express -B8 and -B27, but HLA-A alleles have not been determined. Various C1R and T2 cell lines expressing HLA-B27 mutants and/or TAP1/TAP2 were produced by co-electroporation of plasmid DNA with pSV2Neo followed by antibiotic (geneticin) selection as described previously (14Colbert R.A. Rowland-Jones S.L. McMichael A.J. Frelinger J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6879-6883Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). C1R.B7, C1R.B8, and C1R.B53 were kindly provided by Charles Lutz (University of Iowa), Tom Spies (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center), and Peter Cresswell (Yale University), respectively. Cells were grown in R-10 (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin). Antibiotic-resistant transfectants were maintained in Geneticin (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) at 0.5 mg of activity/ml and/or hygromycin (Calbiochem) at 0.5 mg/ml. Freshly isolated splenocytes obtained from HLA-B27 transgenic and nontransgenic β2m-deficient C57BL/6 mice (26Kingsbury D.J. Mear J.P. Witte D.P. Taurog J.D. Roopenian D.C. Colbert R.A. Arthritis Rheum. 2000; 43: 2290-2296Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were used for immunoprecipitation studies. W6/32 recognizes a conformation-dependent epitope on HLA class I molecules that is considered dependent on β2m and peptide binding (38Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.J. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Zeigler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar). ME.1 recognizes primarily HLA-B27, -B7, and -Bw22, and is also conformation dependent (39Ellis S.A. Taylor C. McMichael A.J. Hum. Immunol. 1982; 5: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). HC10 recognizes free (unfolded) B and C allele HC (40Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar); 5H7 recognizes a conformational α3 domain epitope with broad class I specificity (41Smith D.M. Bluestone J.A. Jeyarajah D.R. Newberg M.H. Engelhard V.H. Thistlethwaite J.R.J. Woodle E.S. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1054-1067PubMed Google Scholar). 3B10.7 is a rat monoclonal antibody with broad specificity for human class I alleles and is not conformation dependent (10Hughes E.A. Hammond C. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1896-1901Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 42Lutz P.M. Cresswell P. Immunogenetics. 1987; 25: 228-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MARB4 recognizes a subset of HLA-B27 molecules, some of which contain “long” peptides (43Urban R.G. Chicz R.M. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Rehm A. Kenter M.J.H. Uytde-Haag F.G.C.M. Ploegh H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells (2 × 107/time point) were preincubated in Met/Cys-deficient R-10 media for 1 h at 37 °C, pulse-labeled with 2 mCi of [35S]Met/Cys (Easytag, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and then chased in a 10-fold excess of media containing 2 mm Met/Cys. The length of pulses for various experiments is indicated in the figure legends. At the end of each time point, cells were harvested by centrifugation after the addition of 5 volumes of ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (PLB; 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 5 mm iodoacetamide, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mm N α-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma)) for 20 min on ice. Post-lysis nuclei were removed with a 10,000 × g spin for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. Cells were rinsed in ice-cold PBS (pH 7.2), then resuspended at 5 × 107 per ml. To 800 μl of cell suspension was added 400 μl of freshly made Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) solution (1.5 mg/ml in PBS at pH 8.0). This solution was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with rocking. Unconjugated reagent was removed with several washes using ice-cold PBS, and the labeled cells were subsequently lysed and used for immunopreciptations. Immunoprecipitations were performed in the following manner unless otherwise stated. Cell lysates were pre-cleared with washed formalin-fixed Staphylococcus aureus(Sigma), and incubated with purified monoclonal antibody (15 μg per 2 × 107 cells in 0.5 ml) for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by the addition of Protein A-Sepharose (100 μl of a 50 mg/ml suspension in PLB) (Sigma) and another hour at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose pellets were washed consecutively with PLB containing 0.1% SDS and 1% bovine serum albumin, a 10-fold dilution of PLB supplemented to 80 mm NaCl, and PLB alone, and stored at −20 °C until electrophoresis. Proteins were eluted from immunoprecipitates by boiling for 5 min in 0.1% SDS (Bio-Rad), then digested overnight at 37 °C in the absence of reducing agents. For endoglycosidase H (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 2 milliunits in 75 mm sodium citrate (pH 5.5) were used; forN-glycanase (Glyko, Novata, CA), 10 milliunits in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) were used, and for mock, citrate buffer alone was used. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) and SDS-PAGE (10.5% gels) were performed as described previously (12Mear J.P. Schreiber K.L. Munz C. Zhu X. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.-G. Rowland-Jones S.L. Colbert R.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6665-6670PubMed Google Scholar). For reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE, samples were boiled for 5 min in an equal volume of 2 × sample buffer with or without dithiothreitol (200 mm), respectively, prior to electrophoresis. For phosphorimage analysis, gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 30 min, then dried. Dried gels were exposed to PhosphorImager plates for 72 h, and 35S-labeled proteins were visualized and quantitated using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Proteins were transferred from SDS-polyacrylamide gels to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) for 1 h at 500 mA in buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. Post-transfer, nonspecific binding was blocked with 1% casein (Sigma) in PBS overnight. Membranes were then incubated for 1 h with 3B10.7 at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. After washing, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated species-specific secondary antibody (Southern BioTechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL) was added for 1 h at a 1:1000 dilution. For detection of biotinylated proteins, alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin was used at a dilution of 1:3000. Proteins were visualized using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium for color development (Sigma). Mock immunoprecipitations were performed with primary antibody in PLB (no cells) followed by Protein A-Sepharose to identify bands arising from cross-reactivity between the alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and the primary antibody used for immunoprecipitation. Unless otherwise noted, material immunoprecipitated from 2 × 107 cells is represented in each lane. To determine whether HLA-B27 HC form aberrant disulfide bound complexes in cells with an intact class I assembly pathway, class I molecules were immunoprecipitated from C1R.B27, separated on SDS-PAGE under nonreducing and reducing conditions, and visualized by immunoblotting. High molecular weight (hMW) HC complexes are seen migrating at ∼90 kDa in addition to monomers at ∼45 kDa (Fig.1 A, NRed). The absence of the hMW bands in untransfected C1R and their elimination by sample reduction prior to electrophoresis (Fig. 1 A,red) indicates they are indeed HLA-B27 HC. These hMW complexes are also seen when cell lysates are applied immediately to SDS-PAGE, indicating that they are not an artifact of immunoprecipitation (data not shown). To prevent post-lysis disulfide bond formation which can occur with HLA class I molecules, particularly during prolonged purification protocols (44Cresswell P. Dawson J.R. J.

W6/32 and HC10 recognize largely distinct populations of HLA class I molecules (38Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.J. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Zeigler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 40Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar). W6/32 is conformation dependent, recognizing folded complexes containing peptide. In contrast, HC10 recognizes free HC not associated with β2m. Thus we refer to W6/32 and HC10-reactive HC as folded and unfolded, respectively, although the degree to which HC10-reactive HC are unfolded is not known (see “Discussion”). The heterogeneity of the hMW complexes recognized by HC10 in comparison to W6/32 (Fig. 1 A) together with sequential immunoprecipitations where W6/32-or HC10-reactive material remains after pre-clearing with the reciprocal antibody (Fig.1 B), reveals that these complexes also contain distinct groups of HLA-B27 molecules. 5H7, which recognizes a folded α3 epitope, does not react with the more heterogeneous HC10-reactive material (Fig. 1 A), raising the possibility that the α3 domain is not properly folded or may be blocked by another protein interacting with free HC. Based on the apparentM r (∼90,000) of the homogeneous band immunoprecipitated by W6/32 and 5H7, its disappearance with sample reduction, and the previous report of HLA-B27 dimerization in vitro (18Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar), we conclude that it is a HC-HC dimer linked by a disulfide bond. Consistent with this, purified W6/32-reactive material reveals only two protein bands (HC and β2m) following sample reduction (data not shown). However, we have not completely ruled out the possibility that the hMW complexes, particularly those recognized by HC10, might contain an additional protein (or proteins) (see “Discussion”). A small percentage of cell surface HLA-B27 complexes are recognized by the monoclonal antibody MARB4. When purified from whole cell lysates, these were found to contain peptides of a much broader size range than the canonical 8–11 residues, including peptides up to 33 amino acids in length (43Urban R.G. Chicz R.M. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Rehm A. Kenter M.J.H. Uytde-Haag F.G.C.M. Ploegh H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations with MARB4 reveal that this antibody recognizes dimers as well as monomers (Fig. 1 C). It is worth noting that the relative intensity of the 90-kDa band compared with the monomer is greater with MARB4 than for other monoclonal antibodies, suggesting that a higher proportion of MARB4-reactive molecules are dimers. The smaller quantity of HC immunoprecipitated with MARB4 (per cell equivalent) is consistent with the lower expression of MARB4-reactive molecules (43Urban R.G. Chicz R.M. Lane W.S. Strominger J.L. Rehm A. Kenter M.J.H. Uytde-Haag F.G.C.M. Ploegh H. Uchanska-Ziegler B. Ziegler A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) (and data not shown). The immunoreactive material in the mock lanes (no cell lysate) is a result of cross-reactivity with the rabbit anti-mouse IgG used to enhance immunoprecipitation. MARB4-reactive dimers can be immunoprecipitated without addition of this cross-linking antibody if more cells are used, whereas MARB4 immunoprecipitations of untransfected C1R reveal no dimer band (data not shown). Recognition of HLA-B27 dimers by MARB4 raises the possibility that some may contain long peptides, although this will need to be addressed experimentally. Taken together, these data indicate that the W6/32-reactive HLA-B27 HC dimers reported previously to form in the absence of β2m or peptide (18Allen R.L. O'Callaghan C.A. McMichael A.J. Bowness P. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 5045-5048PubMed Google Scholar) form in cells with an intact class I assembly pathway. Furthermore, there appears to be a distinct pool of dimers that are reactive with HC10 but not W6/32, and thus are unfolded or possibly misfolded. To assess the kinetics of HLA-B27 dimerization cells were pulsed with [35S]Met/Cys, then chased in media containing excess nonradioactive Met/Cys, and lysed in buffer containing Triton X-100 to dissociate HC from weakly interacting proteins including the peptide loading complex (46Ortmann B. Androlewicz M. Cresswell P. Nature. 1994; 368: 864-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). HC10-reactive dimers are present after a 30-min labeling period (0 h chase), and account for ∼30–40% of the total HC10-reactive HC (Fig.2 A) based on PhosphorImager quantitation (data not shown). It should be noted that this is a minimum estimate, as some of the HC monomer band in C1R.B27 derives from HLA-C (35Zemmour J. Little A.-M. Schendel D.J. Parham P. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 1941-1948PubMed Google Scholar), whereas this allele does not contribute to the dimer bands (Fig. 2 A, C1R lane). Dimers and monomers decay at approximately the same rate during the 4-h chase, and are initially sensitive to Endo H (Fig. 2 B). However, after longer chase periods (>6 h) Endo H-resistant HC10-reactive dimers can be detected (data not shown). There is a faint band migrating near the bottom of the hMW HC (4 h lane, bracket) that is not seen in untransfected C1R and remains after sample reduction (1.5 h lane, red). This band is not HC as it is not reactive with anti-HC antibody in immunoblots (Fig. 1 A). It has been tentatively identified as the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78. 2M. L. DeLay and R. A. Colbert, unpublished observations. The rapid formation and initial sensitivity of HC10-reactive HLA-B27 dimers to Endo H indicates they form in the ER shortly after HC synthesis. W6/32-reactive dimers were not detected during the time course shown in Fig. 2 A (data not shown), so cells were labeled and chased for a longer period to enhance detection. Dimers representing up to ∼10% of the total W6/32-precipitable HC were detected after a 12-h labeling period (Fig. 2 C) that decayed with kinetics similar to folded monomer HC. Folded dimers were found to be Endo H-resistant in immunoblotting experiments (Fig. 2 B), indicating they have been sialylated. Both folded and unfolded dimers can be l"

In patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma, differential display shows that aldo-keto reductase (AKR1C) transcripts are dramatically overexpressed. However, whether AKR1C isoforms contribute to the carcinogenic process and oxidize potent PAHtrans-dihydrodiols (proximate carcinogens) to reactive and redox active o-quinones is unknown; nor is it known whether these reactions occur in human lungs. We now show that four homogeneous human recombinant aldo-keto reductases (AKR1C1–AKR1C4) are regioselective and oxidize only the relevant non-K regiontrans-dihydrodiols. However, these enzymes are not stereo-selective, since they oxidized 100% of these racemic substrates. The highest utilization ratios (V max/K m ) were observed for some of the most potent proximate carcinogens known (e.g.7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol (DMBA-3,4-diol) and benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-diol). In vitro, DMBA-3,4-diol was oxidized by AKR1C4 to the highly reactive 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-dione (DMBA-3,4-dione), which was trapped in situ as its mono- and bis-thioether conjugates, which arise from the sequential 1,6- and 1,4-Michael addition of thiol nucleophiles. Human multiple tissue expression array analysis showed that AKR1C isoform transcripts were highly expressed in the human lung carcinoma cell line A549. Isoform-specific reverse transcriptase-PCR showed that AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3 transcripts were all expressed. Western blot analysis and functional assays confirmed high expression of AKR1C protein and enzyme activity in these lung cells. A549 cell lysates were found to convert DMBA-3,4-diol to the corresponding o-quinone. In trapping experiments, LC/MS analysis identified peaks in the cell lysates that corresponded to the synthetically prepared mono- and bis-thioether conjugates of DMBA-3,4-dione. This quinone is one of the most electrophilic and redox-active o-quinones produced by AKRs. Its unique ability to form bis-thioether conjugates parallels the formation of bis- and tris-glutathionyl conjugates of hydroquinone, which display end organ toxicity.

PAHs are metabolically activated to exert their deleterious effects. Three principal pathways have been proposed for PAH activation and are shown for the representative compound BP (Fig. 1). The first pathway involves the formation of radical cations catalyzed by P450 peroxidases (1Cavalieri E.L. Rogan E.G. Xenobiotica. 1995; 25: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Radical cations form N-7 guanine-depurinating DNA adducts, a process that can lead to G to T transversions in ras (2Chakravarti D. Pelling J.C. Cavalieri E.L. Rogan E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10422-10426Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 3Todorovic R. Ariese F. Devanesan P. Jankowiak R. Small G.J. Rogan E. Cavalieri E. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 941-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the second pathway, PAHs are activated by members of the CYP superfamily to form an arene oxide on the terminal benzo-ring; subsequent hydrolysis by epoxide hydrolase results in the formation of non-K region trans-dihydrodiols, which are potent proximate carcinogens (4Gelboin H.V. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1107-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). The trans-dihydrodiols can then undergo a secondary epoxidation to form bay region anti- orsyn-diol epoxides, which are potent mutagens and tumorigens (4Gelboin H.V. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 1107-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar). Preferential formation of N2-dGuo stable adducts can lead to G to T transversions via error-prone trans-lesional synthesis (5Zhang Y. Yuan F., Wu, X. Rechkoblit O. Taylor J-S. Geacintov N.E. Wang Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G to T transversions are common mutations observed in K-ras andp53 2The p53 mutations in lung cancer can be found on the World Wide Web at perso.curie.fr/Thierry.Soussi/p53_mutation_in_%20lung.html. in human lung cancer (6Rodenhuis S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 241-247PubMed Google Scholar). The third pathway involves dihydrodiol dehydrogenase(s), members of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily, which divert PAHtrans-dihydrodiols to the corresponding o-quinone (7Smithgall T.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6184-6191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Smithgall T.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M.

The NADP+-dependent oxidation of thetrans-dihydrodiol initially results in a ketol that spontaneously rearranges to form a catechol. The catechol is unstable and undergoes autoxidation in air. The first one-electron oxidation results in the formation of an o-semiquinone anion radical and hydrogen peroxide. The second one-electron oxidation produces the fully oxidized o-quinone and superoxide anion (Fig.1) (10Penning T.M. Ohnishi S.T. Ohnishi T. Harvey R.G. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1996; 9: 84-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The resultingo-quinones are highly reactive Michael acceptors, which can form stable and depurinating DNA adducts (11Shou M. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Carcinogenesis. 1993; 14: 475-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12McCoull K.D. Rindgen D. Blair I.A. Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Theseo-quinones can also undergo a two-electron nonenzymatic reduction to reform the catechol or a one-electron enzymatic reduction to reform the o-semiquinone anion radical (13Flowers-Geary L. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry (Life Science Advances). 1992; 11: 49-58Google Scholar, 14Flowers-Geary L. Bleczinski W. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1996; 99: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These events establish futile redox cycles in which the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) can be amplified multiple times. ROS can cause the formation of oxidatively damaged bases (15Frenkel K. Pharmacol. Ther. 1992; 53: 127-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) (e.g.8-oxo-dGuo). Formation of 8-oxo-dGuo can give straight-forward routes to G to T transversions and could account for these mutations in K-ras (6Rodenhuis S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1992; 3: 241-247PubMed Google Scholar) and p53 2 in human lung cancer. Since ROS are the causative agents in radiation-induced carcinogenesis, the pathway of PAH metabolism initiated by AKRs may also explain how PAH can act as complete carcinogens. Four human dihydrodiol dehydrogenases, AKR1C1 (DD1 or 20α(3α)-HSD), AKR1C2 (DD2 or bile acid-binding protein), AKR1C3 (DDx or type 2 3α-HSD), and AKR1C4 (DD4, chlordecone reductase or type 1 3α-HSD) have been cloned from human hepatoma cells, and the recombinant enzymes were previously shown to oxidize BP-7,8-diol to BP-7,8-dione (16Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, the ability of these human enzymes to oxidizetrans-dihydrodiols of potent carcinogenic PAH was not examined. Further, their importance in human lung cancer is not known. Recently, differential display has shown the overexpression of human AKR1C isoforms in non-small cell lung carcinoma. High expression was observed in 384 patients and was a prognostic indicator of poor disease outcome (17Hsu N-Y., Ho, H-C. Chow K-C. Lin T-Y. Shih C-S. Wang L-S. Tsai C-M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2727-2731PubMed Google Scholar). Because AKR1C1 is induced in ethacrynic acid-resistant human colon cells (18Ciaccio P.J. Jaiswal A.K. Tew K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15558-15562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was suggested that overexpression of AKR1C may predispose patients to resistance to cancer chemotherapeutic agents. However, AKR1C isoforms have not been shown to metabolize these drugs. In this study, our first goal was to determine the substrate specificity of all four human AKR1C isozymes toward a variety of PAHtrans-dihydrodiols including DMBA-3,4-diol, 5MC-7,8-diol, and B[g]C-11,12-diol. Each of thesetrans-dihydrodiols are precursors of diol-epoxides, which are potent rodent lung carcinogens (19Amin S. Desai D. Harvey R.G. Hecht S.S. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2813-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Amin S. Desai D., El- Bayoumy K. Rivenson A. Hecht S.S. Polycyclic Aromatic Compounds. 1994; 11: 365-371Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21Manan S. Storrer R.D. Prahalada S. Leander K.R. Kraynak A.R. Hammermeister C.L. Josyln D.J. Lediwth B.J. Vanzwieten M.J. Bradley M.O. Nichols W.W. Mol. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 6: 68-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Demonstration that thesetrans-dihydrodiols could be converted too-quinones would suggest that human AKRs contribute to the further activation of these proximate carcinogens. We demonstrate that DMBA-3,4-diol is enzymatically oxidized to DMBA-3,4-dione, which was trapped as its mono- and bis-thioether conjugates. Our second goal was to determine whether AKR1C isoforms are functionally active in lung cells. We used array analysis to identify the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 as a rich source of AKR1C isoforms and demonstrate that this cell line is also capable of converting DMBA-3,4-diol to DMBA-3,4-dione. The preferential oxidation of potent proximate carcinogenic trans-dihydrodiols by AKR1C isoforms in human lung cells suggests that the AKR pathway plays a role in PAH-induced lung carcinogenesis. The demonstration that the highly reactive DMBA-3,4-dione forms bis-thioether conjugates by sequential 1,6- and 1,4Michael addition raises the possibility that bis-conjugates may form with other cellular nucleophiles and that these may have unique end organ toxicity. Cell culture media and reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. NADP+ and NAD+nucleotide cofactors were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 1-Acenaphthenol was obtained from Sigma. All solvents were HPLC grade, and all other chemicals used were of the highest grade available. Recombinant human AKR1C1–AKR1C4 proteins were overexpressed inEscherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as previously described (16Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Their representative specific activities were as follows: AKR1C1, 2.1 μmol/min/mg; AKR1C2, 2.5 μmol/min/mg; AKR1C3, 2.8 μmol/min/mg; AKR1C4, 0.21 μmol/min/mg. Specific activities were measured using 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2.3 mm NAD+, and 1 mm 1-acenaphthenol (AKR1C1–3) or 75 μm androsterone (AKR1C4). NP-1,2-diol was synthesized by reducing naphthalene-1,2-dione with sodium borohydride in ethanol (22Platt K.L. Oesch F. J. Org. Chem. 1983; 48: 265-268Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar).

(±)-BP-7,8-diol was purchased from the National Cancer Institute, Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository at Chemsyn Science Laboratories (Lenexa, KS). DMBA-3,4-dione was synthesized as described (32Sukumaran K.B. Harvey R.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1979; 101: 1353-1354Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Note that all PAHs are potentially hazardous and should be handled in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines for the laboratory use of chemical carcinogens. The initial velocities of enzymatic oxidation of each trans-dihydrodiol substrate were determined spectrophotometrically using 2.3 mmNADP+ as cofactor in 1.0 ml of 50 mmAMPSO buffer, pH 9.0, at 25 °C. Thetrans-dihydrodiol substrates were dissolved in Me2SO, and the final concentration of organic solvent in the assay was 8%. Reactions were monitored by following the increase in absorbance of the reduced pyridine nucleotide at 340 nm on a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer. The specific activity for 1-acenaphthenol oxidation in the presence of 8% Me2SO was reduced by 50% for AKR1C1, 20% for AKR1C2, 22% for AKR1C3, and 65% for AKR1C4; therefore initial velocity data were corrected for the level of inhibition observed. Potassium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) containing 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol and 25 μm DMBA-3,4-dione in 8% Me2SO was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C with stirring. The reaction was terminated by extraction with ethyl acetate. Organic extracts were combined and dried over sodium sulfate, and the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was redissolved in acetonitrile and was analyzed by LC/MS. To characterize the product of DMBA-3,4-diol oxidation catalyzed by AKR1C4, incubations were conducted in 50-ml systems containing 25 μm DMBA-3,4-diol, 2.3 mm NADP+, 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol as trapping agents in the presence of 8% Me2SO. Following the addition of the purified enzyme (∼1 mg), the reaction was incubated for 20 h at 37 °C and then terminated by extraction of the reaction mixture with ethyl acetate (two 50-ml aliquots). The organic extracts were combined and dried over sodium sulfate, and the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting solid was redissolved in acetonitrile and was analyzed by LC/MS. MS and MS/MS of the reaction product was compared with that obtained for the synthetically prepared DMBA-3,4-dione thioether conjugates. Mass spectrometric data were acquired on a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoQuest, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Finnigan electrospray ionization source. The mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion mode. On-line chromatography was performed using a Waters Alliance 2690 HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). A YMC C18 ODS-AQ column was used at a flow rate of 0.9 ml/min. Solvent A was 5 mmammonium acetate in water containing 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid, and solvent B was 5 mm ammonium acetate in methanol containing 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid with the gradient conditions as follows: 30% B at 0 min, 30% B at 5 min, 100% B at 16 min, 100% B at 24 min, and 30% B at 26 min. The A549 human lung carcinoma cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC number CCL-185) and maintained in F-12K nutrient mixture (Kaighn's modification) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1%l-glutamate, and 1% OPI solution. HepG2 hepatoma cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin solution. H441 and H358 human bronchoalveolar cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamate, and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, whereas H358-AKR1C2 transfectants were grown in the same conditions as the parental cell line in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 to maintain selection. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2and were passaged every 4 days at 1:10 dilution. A dot blot containing poly(A)+ RNA from multiple human tissues (Human Multiple Expression Array; CLONTECH; catalog no. 7776-1) was hybridized to a randomly primed cDNA probe containing the entire open reading frame of AKR1C2 (XhoI/XbaI (∼1 kb)) fragment from pET16b-AKR1C2 (16Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6781-6790Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Random priming was achieved with radiolabeled [α-32P]dCTP, and a final specific activity greater than 109 cpm/μg of DNA was attained. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 6 h, and blots were washed with 2× standard saline citrate plus 1% SDS at 60 °C for 40 min. The blots were subjected to autoradiography at −70 °C. Cellular RNA was isolated using TRIZOL reagent. Total RNA (20 μg) was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred overnight to a Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene). Membranes were prehybridized in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH) at 65 °C for 30 min. After prehybridization, membranes were hybridized to 107 dpm of [α-32P]dCTP probe corresponding to the entire open reading frame of AKR1C2 cDNA that was labeled by random priming to a specific activity of 109 cpm/μg of DNA. Hybridization was performed at 65 °C for 6 h. After hybridization, the blot was subjected to two washes with 2× SSC plus 1% SDS at 60 °C for 20 min each. The blot was then exposed to x-ray film at −80 °C overnight. For purposes of normalization, the blot was stripped and reprobed with a 1-kb fragment of β-actin labeled by random priming as described above. Total RNA (1 μg) from A549 cells was reverse transcribed into cDNA and was subjected to 25 cycles of reverse transcription PCR amplification. The PCR program included denaturation at 95 °C for 2.5 min and then, for each cycle, a 30-s denaturation step at 95 °C, a 2.5-min annealing step at 60 °C, and a 7-min extension step at 72 °C. The AKR1C isoform-specific primers used have been reported elsewhere (33Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C-F. Lin H-K., Ma, H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). These amplimers yielded a PCR product of 500 bp, whereas the amplimers for GAPDH gave a product of 400 bp, which was used as a positive control. Confluent cells (1 × 107) were washed with 3 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and harvested by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 min. The cells were lysed by hypotonic shock in distilled water. The lysate was homogenized in a glass homogenizer and microcentrifuged for 5 min. Aliquots of the lysate were then added to 1.0-ml systems containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 2.3 mm NAD+, 1 mm1-acenaphthenol, and 4% acetonitrile. The enzyme reaction was monitored by following the change in pyridine nucleotide absorbance at 340 nm for 15 min at 25 °C. Isolated proteins from each cell line were boiled for 5 min and were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters. Filters were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-AKR1C9 antiserum (71536) at a 1:1000 dilution (34Smithgall T.E. Penning T.M. Biochem. J. 1988; 254: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunoblots were developed by incubation with the goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate using ECL Western blot detection reagent. To determine the preference of AKR1C enzymes to oxidize potent PAH trans-dihydrodiol proximate carcinogens, a structural series of diols ranging in ring number and arrangement from naphthalene-1,2-diol to benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-diol was examined as potential substrates. In this substrate series, it is the presence of a non-K region trans-dihydrodiol, a bay region, and ultimately a methylated bay region or fjord region that dictates carcinogenicity of the resultant diol-epoxide (Fig.3). Of the varioustrans-dihydrodiols examined, DMBA-3,4-diol and B[g]C-11,12-diol represent potent methylated bay region and fjord region proximate carcinogens, respectively (Fig. 2). Due to the limited solubility of PAH trans-dihydrodiols, direct determination of K m and V maxvalues were not possible. Instead, the initial velocity oftrans-dihydrodiol oxidation was measured at very low substrate concentrations relative to K m in the presence of saturating concentrations of NADP+. The Michaelis-Menten equation in this case simplifies tov/[S] =V max/K m , providing a direct estimation of utilization ratio. Specific activities and utilization ratios are reported for the various PAH trans-dihydrodiols examined with NADP+ as coenzyme at pH 9.0 (TableI).Table IOxidation of structurally diverse PAH trans-dihydrodiols by human AKR1CsPAHtrans-dihydrodiolAKR1C1AKR1C2AKR1C3AKR1C4Specific activity V max/K m 1-aV max/K m = nmol/min/mg/[S], where v/[S] =V max/K m , whereK m ≫ [S].Specific activity V max/K m 1-aV max/K m = nmol/min/mg/[S], where v/[S] =V max/K m , whereK m ≫ [S].Specific activity V max/K m 1-aV max/K m = nmol/min/mg/[S], where v/[S] =V max/K m , whereK m ≫ [S].Specific activity V max/K m 1-aV max/K m = nmol/min/mg/[S], where v/[S] =V max/K m , whereK m ≫ [S]. nmol/min/mg nmol/min/mg nmol/min/mg nmol/min/mgNaphthalene-1,2-diol2034.0701352.7088.50.173400.884Non-K region dihydrodiols Phenanthrene-1,2-diolND1-bND, not detectable.NDNDNDNDNDNDND Chrysene-1,2-diolNDND9.50.1905.50.11513.50.271 Benz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol5.10.2569.50.4759.70.48717.30.869 Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol3.60.1804.70.2350.440.0222.00.103Methylated derivatives 5-Methylchrysene-7,8-diol16.80.33638.50.77712.20.24447.60.952 7-Methylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol2.60.13026.01.32516.80.81425.41.268 12-Methylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diolNDNDNDNDNDNDNDND 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol4.00.20025.21.26610.680.5311005.000K-region dihydrodiol Benz[a]pyrene-4,5-diolNDNDNDNDNDNDNDNDFjord region dihydrodiols Benzo[c]phenanthrene-3,4-diolNDND5.750.1158.850.17711.00.222 Benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-diol6.00.1226.50.13331.00.6202204.46Enzymatic reactions were in 50 mm AMPSO (pH 9) with 2.3 mm NADP+.

In the case of naphthalene, which is a noncarcinogen, the following rank order of utilization ratios was observed for the oxidation of naphthalene-1,2-diol: AKR1C1 > AKR1C2 > AKR1C4 > AKR1C3. In the case of benzo[a]pyrene, a prominent tobacco carcinogen, the K region dihydrodiol, benzo[a]pyrene-4,5-diol, was not a substrate for any of the AKRs tested, whereas the non-K region dihydrodiol, BP-7,8-diol, was oxidized by all of the AKRs. In this instance, AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 gave the highest utilization ratios. By contrast, AKR1C1 gave modest utilization ratios for the oxidation of othertrans-dihydrodiols that contained more than two rings. The highest ratios were seen for 5-MC-7,8-diol, benz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol, and DMBA-3,4-diol. AKR1C2 oxidized PAH trans-dihydrodiols with much higher utilization ratios than AKR1C1. AKR1C2 oxidized the methylated derivatives more efficiently than their parent compounds (e.g. 7MBA-3,4-diol and DMBA-3,4-diol were oxidized with utilization ratios that were 3-fold higher than that observed for benz[a]anthracene-3,4-diol). 5MC-7,8-diol was oxidized with a utilization ratio that was 4-fold higher than that observed for chyrsene-1,2-diol. AKR1C3 also oxidized potent proximate carcinogentrans-dihydrodiols containing more than two rings with high utilization ratios. AKR1C3 displayed the highest utilization ratio for 7MBA-3,4-diol and B[g]C-11,12-diol, whereas DMBA-3,4-diol and 5MC-7,8-diol were also good substrates. AKR1C4 is a liver-specific AKR (33Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Jez J.M. Hung C-F. Lin H-K., Ma, H. Moore M. Palackal N. Ratnam K. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar) that displayed the highest utilization ratios among the 1C members for many of the PAHtrans-dihydrodiols tested. AKR1C4 had the highest utilization ratio for the most potent proximate carcinogens (e.g. DMBA-3,4-diol and the fjord region B[g]C-11,12-diol). Thus, a common trend observed across the human AKR1C isoforms was preferential oxidation oftrans-dihydrodiols of potent proximate carcinogens and, in particular, DMBA-3,4-diol and B[g]C-11,12-diol. To determine whether the AKR1C isoforms exhibit any stereochemical preference for the oxidation of the racemic PAH trans-dihydrodiols substrates, discontinuous HPLC-based enzyme assays were performed. This is an important consideration, since it is ultimately the (−)-R,R-trans-dihydrodiols that are metabolically formed. In these assays, the disappearance of PAH substrate over time was monitored in the presence of enzyme and cofactor. The nmol of trans-dihydrodiol consumed were calculated from appropriate standard curves, which related nmol of the authentic standard to peak area. Enzymatic reactions were conducted until no further change in peak area was observed. Data are shown for the AKR1C2- or AKR1C4-mediated oxidati"

Here, the molecular diversity of chemokines present in ovarian carcinoma was studied by purifying the proteins to homogeneity from ascitic fluid. Biologically active intact CCL2 and processed CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL18 isoforms were recovered. CCL7 and CCL20 were also purified, but their levels were 10-fold lower compared with CXCL8, CCL2, and CCL3 and even 100-fold lower than the amounts of CCL18 isolated. In ascitic fluids from patients with ovarian carcinoma (n = 12), significantly higher levels of CXCL8 and CCL18 (2.0 versus0.7 ng/ml (p = 0.01) and 120 versus 44 ng/ml (p = 0.0002), respectively) were detected compared with those in nonovarian carcinoma patients (n = 12). In contrast to CXCL8, CCL18 was not inducible in carcinoma cell lines. Immunostaining showed CCL18 expression in tumor-infiltrating cells with monocyte/macrophage morphology but not in the ovarian carcinoma cells. Our data demonstrate that biochemically heterogenous but biologically active forms of several chemokines are present at different concentrations in ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid. This points to a delicate balance of chemokines in epithelial ovarian cancer and to a potentially major role for CXCL8 and CCL18 in this tumor.

Standiford T.J. Huffnagle G.B. Colletti L.M. Lukacs N.W. Kunkel S.L. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3583-3586PubMed Google Scholar). This classification corresponds only in part with a biological division of chemokines in groups that selectively attract specific subtypes of leukocytes. For example, CC chemokines are capable to activate and chemoattract multiple leukocytic cell types. Alternative attempts were made to classify chemokines as inflammatory chemokines (i.e.inducible proteins that attract leukocytes to sites of inflammation) or constitutively released homeostatic chemokines that regulate leukocyte homing in the lymphoid system (2Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 254-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Besides their function in leukocyte migration, chemokines are involved in other normal or pathological processes, like hematopoiesis, angiogenesis, cancer growth, and metastasis (3Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar, 4Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). This indicates that our understanding of the exact role of a number of chemokines remains limited. As a consequence, a systematic chemokine and chemokine receptor nomenclature based on protein structure rather than on function has been introduced recently (3Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3246) Google Scholar), despite the fact that not all chemokines nor all their receptors have been identified. Indeed, for some recently cloned chemokines such as CCL18/pulmonary and activation-regulated chemokine (PARC)1 (5Hieshima K. Imai T. Baba M. Shoudai K. Ishizuka K. Nakagawa T. Tsuruta J. Takeya M. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1140-1149PubMed Google Scholar), the regulated production and function of the natural protein has not yet been investigated in detail, and its agonistic receptor remains unknown.Chemokines are produced by a variety of cell types including leukocytes and cancer cells (6Wang J.M. Deng X. Gong W. Su S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7Mantovani A. Vecchi A. Sozzani S. Sica A. Allavena P. Rollins B.J. Chemokines and Cancer. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 35-49Crossref Google Scholar). Tumor-derived chemokines are important for the characteristic recruitment of leukocytes, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and lymphocytes, to the tumor environment and hence contribute to the promotion of a specific host anti-tumor immune response. However, this natural cytotoxicity against tumor cells provoked by the leukocytic infiltrate is counteracted by several tumor-favoring processes mediated by chemokines. In fact, some chemotactic cytokines derived from cancer cells or tumor-associated leukocytes act as growth factors for tumor cells (6Wang J.M. Deng X. Gong W. Su S. J. Immunol. Methods. 1998; 220: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Other chemokines promote tumor growth and metastasis by attracting endothelial cells and by causing angiogenesis or by affecting the motility or the migration of cancer cells (4Gerard C. Rollins B.J. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 108-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 8Müller A. Homey B. Soto H., Ge, N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4410) Google Scholar). Metastasis is also indirectly and in a countercurrent way, enhanced by the chemokine-induced release of matrix-degrading enzymes by the infiltrating leukocytes such as TAM (9Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Rollins B.J. Chemokines and Cancer. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 51-69Crossref Google Scholar). In this manner, the “macrophage balance” hypothesis (10Mantovani A. Bottazzi B. Colotta F. Sozzani S. Ruco L. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 265-270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar) elegantly depicts how TAM possess the dual potential to promote or inhibit malignant cell growth and tumor progression.Ovarian carcinoma is an intriguing model for detailed investigation of the role of chemokines and tumor-associated leukocytes in neoplasia. Epithelial ovarian cancer is an important cause of death for women, since, in most of the cases, the tumor has already asymptomatically disseminated throughout the peritoneal cavity by the time that patients are diagnosed with the disease (11Negus R.P. Balkwill F.R. Rollins B.J. Chemokines and Cancer. Humana Press, Inc., Totowa, NJ1999: 193-205Crossref Google Scholar). The presence of TAM, lymphocytes, and dendritic cells has been demonstrated in the lymphoreticular infiltrate in ovarian carcinoma (12Negus R.P. Stamp G.W. Hadley J. Balkwill F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1723-1734PubMed Google Scholar, 13Melichar B. Savary C. Kudelka A.P. Verschraegen C. Kavanagh J.J. Edwards C.L. Platsoucas C.D. Freedman R.S. Clin.

In addition, mRNA for the chemokines CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), CXCL8/IL-8, and CCL3/macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1α) and, to a lesser extent, CCL4/MIP-1β and CCL5/RANTES were detected in sections of the malignant ovary tissue and in ovarian carcinoma cell lines (12Negus R.P.

Ovarian carcinoma is often accompanied by extensive ascites accumulation, and a number of cytokines have been detected in this peritoneal fluid (16Balkwill F.R. Eur.

Human ascitic fluid is a rich natural source allowing us to identify molecules that may have important functions in the tumor environment and to study their molecular diversity and biological activity at the protein level. This study reports for the first time the isolation of biologically active, posttranslationally modified chemokine isoforms from the ascitic fluid from patients with ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, we found unusually high levels of the chemokine CCL18/PARC (5Hieshima K. Imai T. Baba M. Shoudai K. Ishizuka K. Nakagawa T. Tsuruta J. Takeya M. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R.

Genomics. 1999; 56: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although CCL18/PARC was not produced by the tumor cells, its levels in ascitic fluids were significantly higher in patients with ovarian carcinoma compared with nonovarian carcinoma.DISCUSSIONThe appearance of ascitic fluid due to epithelial ovarian cancer has allowed researchers to study the role of cytokines in this disease (16Balkwill F.R. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5: 379-385PubMed Google Scholar, 17Radke J. Schmidt D. Böhme M. Schmidt U. Weise W. Morenz J. Geburtsh.

Cancer. 1998; 83: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In view of the accumulation of leukocytes in this peritoneal fluid, the presence of chemokines has also been investigated. Enhanced immunoreactivity for the prototypic CXC chemokine CXCL-8/IL-8 and CC chemokine CCL2/MCP-1 has been found in ascitic fluid from ovarian carcinoma patients (15Negus R.P. Stamp G.W. Relf M.G. Burke F. Malik S.T. Bernasconi S. Allavena P. Sozzani S. Mantovani A. Balkwill F.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2391-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 17Radke J. Schmidt D. Böhme M. Schmidt U. Weise W. Morenz J. Geburtsh. Frauenheilkd. 1996; 56: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The substantial volumes of ascites in the tumor environment allowed us to study for the first time the molecular heterogeneity of multiple chemokines present in this pathological fluid. We purified CCL2/MCP-1 and CXCL8/IL-8 isoforms from 850 ml of ascitic fluid from a patient with ovarian carcinoma through a standard four-step purification procedure using specific ELISAs as a screening method. Mass spectrometry, NH2-terminal sequence analysis, SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting revealed the presence of unglycosylated intact CCL2/MCP-1-(1–76). This natural CCL2/MCP-1 was clearly chemotactically active on monocytic THP-1 cells and could therefore contribute to the general recruitment and retention of TAM and lymphocytes in the malignant ovary tissue and the ascitic fluid. However, in a group of 24 patients, we were not able to demonstrate a statistically significant increase of the CCL2/MCP-1 concentrations in ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid compared with nonovarian carcinoma ascites. Once infiltrated in the ovarian carcinoma environment, TAM selectively displayed defective mRNA and surface expression of CC chemokine receptor-2, the unique receptor for CCL2/MCP-1 (31Sica A. Saccani A. Bottazzi B. Bernasconi S. Allavena P. Gaetano B. Fei F. LaRosa G. Scotton C. Balkwill F. Mantovani A. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As a consequence, TAM did not migrate anymore in response to CCL2/MCP-1. Very recently, CC chemokine receptor-1 was found to be the only CC chemokine receptor consistently expressed in the solid ovarian tumor by the infiltrating CD68+ macrophages and CD8+lymphocytes (32Scotton C. Milliken D. Wilson J. Raju S. Balkwill F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar).Further purification and NH2-terminal sequence analysis demonstrated the presence of two CXCL8/IL-8 isoforms in the purified ascitic fluid (i.e. CXCL8/IL-8-(6–77), the isoform that is predominantly produced by PBMC (27Van Damme J. Van Beeumen J. Conings R. Decock B. Billiau A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 181: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and CXCL8/IL-8-(5–77), an as yet undescribed isoform lacking four residues at its NH2terminus). A mixture of these two natural isoforms did still chemoattract neutrophilic granulocytes at about 1 ng/ml. This is in agreement with the fact that NH2-terminally truncated forms of CXCL8/IL-8 are more active than the intact form and with the reported chemotactic potency of a natural mixture of leukocyte-derived CXCL8/IL-8-(6–77) and CXCL8/IL-8-(8–77) isoforms (28Van den Steen P.E. Proost P. Wuyts A. Van Damme J. Opdenakker G. Blood. 2000; 96: 2673-2681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Proost P. Wuyts A. Conings R. Lenaerts J.-P. Billiau A. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10170-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, we found 3-fold higher CXCL8/IL-8 levels (p = 0.01) in ovarian carcinoma compared with nonovarian carcinoma ascites, in support of existing reports on significant CXCL8/IL-8 increases in the ascitic or cyst fluid of epithelial ovarian cancer patients (17Radke J. Schmidt D. Böhme M. Schmidt U. Weise W. Morenz J. Geburtsh. Frauenheilkd. 1996; 56: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,33Ivarsson K. Runesson E. Sundfeldt K. Haeger M. Hedin L. Janson P.O. Brännström M. Gynecol. Oncol. 1998; 71: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). With an average CXCL8/IL-8 concentration of 2.0 ng/ml measured in the crude ascitic fluids, the natural mixture of CXCL8/IL-8 isoforms is in theory able to chemoattract neutrophilic granulocytes to the ovarian carcinoma environment. However, the cellular infiltrate in ovarian carcinoma appears to contain only few neutrophils, mainly in the lumina of blood vessels (12Negus R.P. Stamp G.W. Hadley J. Balkwill F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1723-1734PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, if CXCL8/IL-8 is implicated in ovarian carcinoma, it is probably not predominant in the chemoattraction of neutrophils. Instead, CXCL8/IL-8 could promote angiogenesis or influence the motility of the ovarian epithelial tumor cells, expressing the CXCL8/IL-8 receptor CXCR1 (34Ivarsson K. Ekerydh A. Fyhr I.-M. Janson P.O. Brännström M. Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Scand. 2000; 79: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 35Venkatakrishnan G. Salgia R. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6868-6875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). As a contrast, out of 14 investigated chemokine receptors including CXCR1, only CXCR4 was expressed on ovarian cancer cells (19Scotton C.J. Wilson J.L. Milliken D. Stamp G. Balkwill F.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4961-4965PubMed Google Scholar). Until the present, it has remained unclear whether the expression of CXCL8/IL-8 by ovarian cancer cells is beneficial or detrimental for the tumor progression.In addition, we isolated a biologically active isoform of CCL3/MIP-1α missing four NH2-terminal amino acids from the same ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid, extending the reported presence of CCL3/MIP-1α mRNA in ovarian cancer biopsies (12Negus R.P. Stamp G.W. Hadley J. Balkwill F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1723-1734PubMed Google Scholar). Whether CCL3/MIP-1α could play a major role in ovarian cancer biology remains to be seen, since the CCL3/MIP-1α levels were lower than 2 ng/ml in the ascitic fluids from both ovarian carcinoma and nonovarian carcinoma patients. Two other CC chemokines not previously reported in relation to ovarian carcinoma (i.e. CCL7/MCP-3 and CCL20/LARC) were recovered, albeit in minor quantities, from ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid. CCL7/MCP-3 was originally isolated from osteosarcoma cells (36Van Damme J. Proost P. Lenaerts J.-P. Opdenakker G. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). CCL20/LARC mRNA was previously detected in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and in epithelial cells of the appendix and of inflamed tonsils (37Kleeff J. Kusama T. Rossi D.L. Ishiwata T. Maruyama H.

Med. 1998; 188: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1205) Google Scholar). In addition, CCL20/LARC protein was inducible in epidermal carcinoma cells (23Schutyser E. Struyf S. Menten P. Lenaerts J.-P. Conings R. Put W. Wuyts A. Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4470-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, we found that the CCL7/MCP-3 and CCL20/LARC concentrations in ascitic fluid accompanying epithelial ovarian cancer remained below 0.5 and 0.4 ng/ml, respectively.In contrast to CXCL8/IL-8, CCL2/MCP-1, CCL3/MIP-1α, CCL7/MCP-3, and CCL20/LARC, extremely high levels of CCL18/PARC were detected in the ascitic fluid from ovarian carcinoma patients (124 ng/ml). Furthermore, these levels were significantly more elevated than in nonovarian carcinoma patients (44 ng/ml; p = 0.0002). CCL18/PARC was only recently described as a T- and B-cell chemoattractant, structurally most homologous to CCL3/MIP-1α (5Hieshima K. Imai T. Baba M. Shoudai K. Ishizuka K. Nakagawa T. Tsuruta J.

Only recently, dendritic cells and macrophages have been demonstrated to produce CCL18/PARC (40Lindhout E. Vissers J.L.M. Hartgers F.C. Huijbens R.J.F. Scharenborg N.M. Figdor C.G. Adema G.J. J.

Immunol. 2001; 31: 3755-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the protein is inducible in monocyte/macrophages by IL-4 and staphylococcal enterotoxins and is significantly enhanced in septic and rheumatoid arthritis (47Schutyser E. Struyf S. Wuyts A. Put W. Geboes K. Grillet B. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2001; 31: 3755-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of authentic CCL18/PARC protein in human ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid was confirmed here by the isolation of substantial amounts of chemokine (1.5 μg from 50 ml), which occurred in two isoforms: intact CCL18/PARC-(1–69) and, to a lesser extent, truncated CCL18/PARC-(1–68) lacking the COOH-terminal alanine. These CCL18/PARC isoforms showed significant chemotactic activity on lymphocytes at about 1 ng/ml. The presence of significantly enhanced levels of biologically active CCL18/PARC in the ovarian carcinoma ascitic fluid could point to an important role for CCL18/PARC in the recruitment of lymphocytes to the ovarian carcinoma environment. In addition, CCL18/PARC might be involved in other processes involving tumor progression (e.g. as growth factor for the tumor cells or as a factor directly or indirectly influencing angiogenesis or metastasis). Indeed, the recent reports on the specific chemokine receptor expression in the ovarian carcinoma environment (19Scotton C.J. Wilson J.L. Milliken D. Stamp G. Balkwill F.R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4961-4965PubMed Google Scholar, 32Scotton C. Milliken D. Wilson J. Raju S. Balkwill F. Br. J. Cancer. 2001; 85: 891-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) could not take into account the yet unknown PARC receptor. The identification of a functional CCL18/PARC receptor and of a CCL18/PARC homologue in a laboratory animal would facilitate the search for other possible target cells and relevant functions of CCL18/PARC in ovarian carcinoma.With regard to the potential producer cells of CCL18/PARC, unstimulated ovarian carcinoma SW626 cells as well as stimulated ovarian and other carcinoma cell lines failed to secrete CCL18/PARC protein, although they were good cellular sources of CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL8/IL-8, and CCL20/LARC (Fig. 7; (23Schutyser E. Struyf S. Menten P. Lenaerts J.-P. Conings R. Put W. Wuyts A. Proost P. Van Damme J. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4470-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); data not shown). Thus, ovarian carcinoma cells can account for the presence of the relatively low levels of the inflammatory chemokines CXCL8/IL-8 (Fig. 7; (34Ivarsson K. Ekerydh A. Fyhr I.-M. Janson P.O. Brännström M. Acta Obstet. Gynecol. Scand. 2000; 79: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) and CCL2/MCP-1 (12Negus R.P. Stamp G.W. Hadley J. Balkwill F.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 1723-1734PubMed Google Scholar) but not for the unexpectedly high concentrations of CCL18/PARC, formerly classified as a homeostatic chemokine. The lack of CCL18/PARC expression by ovarian carcinoma cells was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of malignant ovarian tissue and of cells isolated from the ascitic fluid. The inflammatory mononuclear cells infiltrating the tumor environment were demonstrated to be the CCL18/PARC-producing cells. It is plausible that subsets of the ovarian carcinoma-infiltrating TAM and dendritic cells are a main source of ascitic CCL18/PARC. Indeed, CCL18/PARC is expressed by macrophages, mainly by alveolar macrophages in vivo and after activation of monocyte/macrophages with alternative macrophage mediators such as IL-4 and IL-10 in vitro (5Hieshima K. Imai T. Baba M. Shoudai K. Ishizuka K. Nakagawa T. Tsuruta J. Takeya M. Sakaki Y. Takatsuki K. Miura R. Opdenakker G. Van Damme J. Yoshie O. Nomiyama H. J.

These alternatively activated macrophages are presumed to be immunosuppressive, since they down-modulate Th1-mediated immunity and exert Th2-associated effector functions (48Goerdt S. Orfanos C.E. Immunity. 1999; 10: 137-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). In this context, IL-10-producing immunosuppressive TAM have been detected in the ascites from ovarian carcinoma patients (49Loercher A.E. Nash M.A. Kavanagh J.J. Platsoucas C.D. Freedman R.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6251-6260PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the elevated CCL18/PARC levels in ovarian carcinoma ascites may point to the presence of alternatively activated TAM in this tumor environment. CCL18/PARC could thus be involved in the immunosuppression of a host anti-tumor response by attracting T-lymphocytes to suppressive TAM. Furthermore"

The plethora of compounds, formed in later stages of this process, is summarily subsumed under the term “advanced glycation end products” (AGEs)1 (1Ledl F. Schleicher E. Angew. Chem. Int.

Whereas 3-DG 2is formed almost exclusively via the Amadori product, MG 3derives in vivo mainly from enzymatic or nonenzymatic degradation of triose phosphate intermediates (3Richard P.J. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4581-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 4Phillips S.A. Thornalley P.J. Eur. J.

Generation of GO4 requires an oxidation process and proceeds predominantly under physiological conditions via oxidative degradation of Amadori products (7Glomb M.A. Monnier V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10017-10026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) or lipid peroxidation (8Loidl-Stahlhofen A. Spiteller G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1211: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).A major consequence of the advanced Maillard reaction is the formation of covalently cross-linked proteins; the involvement of α-dicarbonyl compounds in this route may be considered as firmly established. Especially in long lived tissue proteins, the cross-links are supposed to be the most significant AGEs because they are likely responsible,e.g. for the decreased flexibility of collagen (9Reiser K.M. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 218: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and the high level of urea-insoluble proteins in human cataracts (10Nagaraj R.H. Sell D.R. Prabhakaram M.

They may thus contribute to pathophysiologies associated with aging and long term complications of diabetes and atherosclerosis. Although some cross-links have been isolated from tissues (11Sell D.R.

Compounds 9 and 10 are formed by the reaction of two lysine moieties with two molecules each of MG3 and GO 4, respectively, and they represent the quantitatively most important in vivo cross-links according to the literature data. Studies of Eble et al. (20Eble A.S. Thorpe S.R. Baynes J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9406-9412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicate, however, that the major cross-links are labile under conventional acid and alkaline hydrolysis conditions; the significance of the acid-stable compounds 9 and 10 might thus have been overestimated. This hypothesis is supported by model experiments that clearly show formation of 9 and10 to be a secondary process at low α-dicarbonyl levels (19Glomb M.A. Pfahler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41638-41647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 21Lederer M.O. Klaiber R.G. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2499-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar); the physiological concentration, e.g. in plasma of diabetics, is in the lower μm region for both MG3 and GO 4 (22Odani H.

The stable isotope-labeled compounds glucosepane5a-d-13C6, DOGDIC6a,b-13C6, MODIC7-13C3, and GODIC8-13C2 were synthesized independently to allow for an accurate quantification of these cross-links by LC-(ESI)MS. Reference material for MOLD 9 and GOLD 10 has also been prepared.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We have shown previously that the lysine-arginine cross-links DOGDIC6a,b, MODIC 7, and GODIC 8 are obtained in high yield from model reactions of proteins with 3-DG2, MG 3, and GO 4, respectively (21Lederer M.O.

Furthermore, we could recently prove formation of the bicyclic cross-link glucosepane 5a-d to proceed via the so far unknownN 6-(2,3-dihydroxy-5,6-dioxohexyl)-l-lysinate (1a,b) (24Biemel K.M. Conrad J. Lederer M.O. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2002; 41: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this dideoxyosone, the lysineN ε is bonded directly to C-1 of the original carbohydrate backbone; generation of 1a,b requires carbonyl shifts along the entire carbohydrate backbone.We now report on the identification and quantification of the cross-links 5–10 in human serum albumin (HSA) from healthy controls and diabetics as well as in the water-insoluble fraction of lens proteins from normoglycemic subjects. To guarantee accurate quantification by LC-(ESI)MS, 13C-labeled standards for5–8 were synthesized independently and their structures established unequivocally. Additionally, compounds 5–8 were tested for their stability under quasiphysiological conditions. A rationale is given for the finding that glucosepane 5a-drepresents the dominant in vivo cross-link.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsMilli-Q water (purified to 18 megohms·cm−2; Millipore, Eschborn, Germany) was used in the preparation of all solutions. HPLC grade methanol was employed for LC and LC-MS. For preparative HPLC, solvents were degassed by flushing with helium. Propionic acid, 2-propanol,Nα -t-Boc-l-lysine andNα -t-Boc-l-arginine, formaldehyde solution (∼37%), glyoxal solution (∼40%), and methylglyoxal solution (∼40%) were purchased from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany). n-Heptafluorobutyric acid was from Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), peptidase, and aminopeptidase M were from Sigma (Steinheim). d-Glucose and Pronase E were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany), andd-glucose-13C6 was from Dr. Glaser AG (Basel, Switzerland). For a PBS mixture giving solutions with pH 7.4, KH2PO4 (2.68 g, 20 mmol) and Na2HPO42H2O (14.30 g, 80 mmol) were mixed vigorously.Synthesis of Glucosepane5a-d-13C6, DOGDIC6a,b-13C6, MODIC7-13C3, and GODIC8-13C2Nα -t-Boc-l-lysine (1.52 g, 6.2 mmol),Nα -t-Boc-l-arginine (1.15 g, 4.2 mmol), andd-glucose-13C6 (363 mg, 1.95 mmol) were dissolved in 10 ml of water, and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 by adding solid NaHCO3 (synthesis of6a,b-13C6,7-13C3,8-13C2) or phosphate buffer (1.7 g, 10 mmol; synthesis of 5a-d-13C6). The mixtures were kept at 50 °C for 21 days and purified by preparative HPLC (column A, gradient A).

The pH was adjusted to 7 by slowly adding solid NaHCO3, the volume finally filled up to 4 ml, and the mixture subjected to preparative HPLC (column A, gradient B). Fractions with t R5.3 and 6.4 min from fraction I yielded, after lyophilization,5c-13C6·3 HCOOH (3.6 mg, 0.0063 mmol, 0.32%) and 5a-13C6·3 HCOOH (15.7 mg, 0.0274 mmol, 1.41%), respectively.

Aliquots were taken at regular intervals and subjected to LC-(ESI)MS analysis (gradient B, full scan mode). In a second experiment, ultrafiltered protein from an 8-week incubation of 100 mmglucose with 50 g/liter bovine serum albumin (BSA) was kept at pH 7.4, 37 °C in PBS for several weeks. Aliquots (0.5 ml) containing 2.5 mg of protein were taken at regular intervals, the protein cleaved enzymatically, and the hydrolysate analyzed by LC-(ESI)MS (gradient B, SIM mode).Type 1 Diabetics and Control SubjectsPermission to use blood from type 1 diabetic patients was obtained from the local ethics committee, and each patient was informed about the aims of the study. The patients were selected on the following criteria: age, ≤ 40 years; duration of diabetes, ≥ 2 years; normal triglyceride (75–150 mg/dl) and cholesterol (120–200 mg/dl) levels; no blood transfusion within the previous 3 months. The HbA1c values were supplied by the hospital laboratory; they were determined by ion exchange chromatography according to a standard protocol and range between 4.3 and 6.1% for normoglycemics. Controls were healthy, nondiabetic volunteers (age ≤ 40 years) from the Institute of Food Chemistry of the University of Hohenheim and from the Bürgerhospital.Water-insoluble Proteins from Human LensesThese were generously supplied by R. H. Nagaraj (Department of Ophthalmology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH). The samples were obtained from normoglycemic subjects (age 59–87 years) and comprised material with the following classifications: normal, type I + III cataract, and brunescent cataract.Isolation of HSAFresh blood (9 ml) from type 1 diabetics and nondiabetic individuals was collected into sterile tubes containing EDTA and centrifuged within 2 h (2,500 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). Trichloroacetic acid (2 ml, 20%) was added to the plasma (2 ml), and the suspension was mixed vigorously and kept for 15 min. Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifugation (2,500 ×g, 4 °C, 15 min). The pellet was taken up in phosphate buffer (3 ml, 0.1 m, pH 7.4) and centrifuged again. The proteins were suspended in the phosphate buffer (3 ml), transferred to an Amicon 8050 (Witten, Germany) stirred cell, diluted to 20 ml, and ultrafiltered (Millipore PM 10 filter discs, molecular mass cutoff, 10 kDa) with water (0.6 liter) by applying a pressure of 4.5 bar. The retained material was lyophilized and stored at –20 °C.Enzymatic Protein Hydrolysis and LC Clean-up of the Cross-linksAliquots of plasma proteins (3 mg) and water-insoluble lens proteins (1.5 mg), respectively, were hydrolyzed enzymatically according to the procedure of Glomb and Pfahler (19Glomb M.A. Pfahler C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41638-41647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), protocol C. A stock solution (10 μl) containing 4.5 mg/liter5a-d-13C6, 2.4 mg/liter6a,b-13C6, 2.4 mg/liter7-13C3, and 2.4 mg/liter8-13C2 was added at the outset of the digestion procedure. The hydrolysates were ultrafiltered by centrifugation (Millipore Ultrafree MC, molecular mass cutoff, 5 kDa) and the filtrates (1 ml) subjected to LC-(ESI)MS analysis (gradient B, SIM mode). The remaining solutions were diluted to 1.5 ml and subjected to preparative HPLC (column B, gradient C). The eluate within 3.5–10 min was collected, lyophilized, and the residue was dissolved in 150 μl of water and subjected to LC-(ESI)MS analysis (gradient B, SIM mode).Preparative HPLCThe preparative HPLC system consisted of a Kronlab (Sinsheim, Germany) KD200/100SS gradient pump system combined with a Knauer (Berlin, Germany) A0293 variable wavelength detector and a (A) Kronlab HPLC column (guard column 50 × 20 mm, column 250 × 20 mm, Nucleosil C18, 100 Å, 7 μm), (B) YMC HPLC column (YMC Europe; Schermbeck, Germany; 250 × 20 mm, YMC-Pack ODS A, 120 Å, 10 μm); injection volume, 1.5 ml; flow rate, 18 ml/min. The following gradients were applied: (A) ammonium formate buffer (10 mm, pH 4.0) and 30% MeOH at 0 min, 70% at 15 min, 100% at 16–21 min, and 30% at 24–30 min. (B) 0% MeOH at 0 min, 6% at 6–10 min, and 0% at 11–16 min. (C) 0% MeOH at 0 min, 5% at 6–10 min, 95% at 13–15 min, and 0% at 18–23 min. Detection was at 244 nm (5–8) or 230 nm (9, 10).LC-(ESI)MS AnalysesThese were run on an HP1100 (Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) HPLC system coupled to a Micromass (Manchester, UK) VG platform II quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray (ESI) interface. The HPLC system comprised an HP1100 autosampler, HP1100 gradient pump, HP1100 thermoregulator, and HP1100 diode array detector (DAD) module. The column was a YMC- Pack Pro C18, 120 Å, 5 μm, (guard column 10 × 4.6 mm, column 150 × 4.6 mm); column temperature 25 °C; flow rate 1.0 ml/min; injection volume 20 μl. The gradients were: (A) 10 mm ammonium formate buffer (pH 4.0) and 5% MeOH at 0 min, 95% at 30–40 min, and 5% at 45–50 min. (B) 10 mm n-heptafluorobutyric acid and 5% MeOH at 0 min; 50% at 25 min, 95% at 30–35 min, and 5% at 40–47 min. For acquisition in the SIM mode, postcolumn addition of propionic acid/2-propanol (3:1, v/v) in a 1:3 ratio with the HPLC mobile phase was performed with a Knauer WellChrom Maxi-Star K-1000 HPLC pump. The eluent was finally split 1:20 before being introduced into the ion source. MS parameters: ESI+, source temperature, 120 °C; capillary, 3.5 kV; HV lens, 0.5 kV; cone, 55 V. The MS system was operated either in full scan (m/z 200–1,000) or in SIM mode (cone, 65 V; span, 0.5 Da; dwell time, 0.2 s; monitoring masses at m/z 453.3, 447.3, 435.3, 429.3, 360.25, 357.25, 345.25, 343.25 or 341.25, and 327.25).NMR Spectroscopy1H and 13C spectra were recorded at 25 °C, in D2O, on a Bruker (Karlsruhe, Germany) ARX 500 spectrometer (500 and 126 MHz nominal frequency, respectively) and/or a Varian (Darmstadt, Germany) Unity-plus 300 instrument (300 and 75 MHz). The Unity-plus 300 was also used for the acquisition of1H,1H DQFCOSY, HSQC, and HMBC (Varian standard library) spectra.LyophilizationA Leybold-Heraeus (Köln, Germany) Lyovac GT 2 and a Labconco Centrivap Concentrator (Kansas City, MO) were applied.StatisticsThe significance was determined according to the Utest by Wilcoxon, Mann, and Whitney; p < 0.05 was considered to represent statistically significant differences.RESULTSSynthesis of 13C-Labeled Reference Material and Determination of the Cross-links by LC-(ESI)MS—As reported previously, the cross-links glucosepane 5a-d, DOGDIC6a,b, MODIC 7, and GODIC 8 (Fig. 2) are unstable under the conventional conditions for acid protein hydrolysis (110 °C, 24 h); this also holds for the pentose-derived structures pentosinane and DOPDIC (21Lederer M.O.

Presently, we examined the possibility that AMPK increases glucose transport through atypical protein kinase Cs (aPKCs) by activating proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (PYK2), ERK pathway components, and phospholipase D (PLD). In mice, treadmill exercise rapidly activated ERK and aPKCs in mouse vastus lateralis muscles.

Although there are a number of health benefits that accrue from exercise in diabetic subjects, a noteworthy effect of exercise is its ability to act like insulin and directly stimulate glucose transport in skeletal muscle. The mechanism for this insulin-like effect of exercise on glucose transport is only partly understood. Like insulin, exercise increases the translocation of Glut4 glucose transporters to the plasma membrane in skeletal muscle; however, these exercise-regulated glucose transporters may largely exist in functional pools different from those mobilized by insulin (1Cordere L. Kandror K.V. Vallega G. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27584-27588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Also, unlike insulin, exercise activates Glut4 translocation/glucose transport in skeletal muscle by a mechanism that does not involve the activation of phosphatidylinositol (PI)13-kinase (2Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Instead, exercise stimulates Glut4 translocation/glucose transport by a mechanism thought to be at least partly dependent upon ATP breakdown, leading to increases in 5′-AMP and activation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, AMPK (2Hayashi T. Hirshman M.F. Kurth E.J. Winder W.W. Goodyear L.J. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1369-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). Accordingly, investigators have used chemical substances, most notably, 5-amino-imidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-riboside (AICAR), which, after uptake and phosphorylation, acts like 5′-AMP to directly activate AMPK, or, to a lesser extent, dinitrophenol (DNP), which uncouples oxidative phosphorylation and thereby increases endogenous 5′-AMP levels to activate AMPK, as partial surrogates for exercise in stimulating Glut4 translocation/glucose transport in skeletal muscle preparations. Despite the apparent involvement of AMPK during exercise, there is little insight into intracellular signaling factors that operate distally to AMPK during exercise-stimulated glucose transport. In the case of insulin-stimulated glucose transport, there is now considerable evidence that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) isoforms (3Bandyopadhyay G. Standaert M.L. Zhao L.-M., Yu, B. Avignon A.

Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of aPKCs during exercise- or AICAR-stimulated glucose transport, to our knowledge, has not been examined. Differently from insulin, we have recently reported that several agonists, including high levels of extracellular glucose (13Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M.L. Quon M.J. Reed B.C.

This activation of aPKCs via PLD and ERK, moreover, occurs in the absence of activation of PI 3-kinase and PKB, and this activation of ERK is dependent on the apparently sequential activation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, proline-rich tyrosine kinase-2 (PYK2), GRB2, SOS, RAS, RAF, and MEK1 (13Bandyopadhyay G.

Inasmuch as exercise is also known to activate the ERK pathway (12Sherwood D.J. Dufresne S.D. Markuns J.F. Cheatham B. Moller D.E. Aronson D. Goodyear L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: E870-E878PubMed Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the ERK/PLD/aPKC pathway may serve as a distal or terminal effector during exercise- and AICAR-stimulated glucose transport. Indeed, as reported herein, exercise, AICAR, and DNP were found to activate ERK and aPKCs in rodent skeletal muscles and/or cultured L6 myotubes, and AICAR- and DNP-stimulated glucose transport in these preparations was found to be dependent upon the activation of the ERK pathway, PLD, and aPKCs. C57Bl/6J mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), housed in a transgenic barrier facility (12 h light/dark cycles), and fed rodent chow (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO) ad libitum. The mice were subjected to treadmill exercise (0.2 m/s, Exer 4/8 Treadmill, Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) and/or treated with bovine insulin (1 unit/kg of body weight; Sigma), which was injected intraperitoneally. At indicated times of exercise and/or insulin treatment, the mice were sacrificed by decapitation, and vastus lateralis skeletal muscles were rapidly excised, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −70 °C for subsequent analyses. All procedures in mice were approved by the Committee on Animal Research of the University of California, San Francisco. Extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were obtained from 200–225-g male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan Industries) and fed standard chow ad libitum. We chose to use the EDL rather than the soleus muscle, as AICAR acutely stimulates transport in the fast twitch EDL, but not in the slow twitch soleus muscle of the rat (15Balon T.W. Jasman A.P.

Precipitates were collected on Sepharose-AG beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and incubated for 8 min at 30 °C in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 μm Na3VO4, 100 μm Na4P2O7, 1 mm NaF, 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg of phosphatidylserine (Sigma), 50 μm[γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 5 mm MgCl2 and, as substrate, 40 μmserine analogue of the PKC-ε pseudosubstrate (BIOSOURCE), a preferred substrate for aPKCs.

Treadmill exercise in mice provoked rapid increases in aPKC activity in vastus lateralis skeletal muscles that were comparable, and, in part, additive, to those of maximally effective concentrations of insulin (Fig. 1). Similarly, treadmill exercise provoked rapid increases in ERK activity in mouse vastus lateralis muscles that were comparable in magnitude to those of insulin (Fig. 1). The studies in mice suggested that exercise, like glucose (13Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M.L. Quon M.J. Reed B.C. Dikic I. Farese R.V. J..Biol.

To examine aspects of this signaling pathway in more detail, we turned to a well established model for studies of exercise that are mediated by AMPK, viz. the use of AMPK activator, AICAR, in rat EDL muscles (15Balon T.W. Jasman A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1008-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, AICAR provoked increases in both 2-deoxyglucose uptake and aPKC activity in rat EDL muscles. These effects of AICAR on aPKCs and 2-deoxyglucose uptake were similar in magnitude to, or only slightly less than, those elicited by insulin during comparable incubations of rat EDL muscles (data not shown). The effects of AICAR on 2-deoxyglucose uptake and aPKC activity in EDL muscles were blocked by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, and by 1-butanol, which as a primary alcohol, inhibits the production of PA by PLD (Fig.2). These findings were consistent the possibility that AICAR-induced increases in glucose transport and aPKC activity were mediated through ERK and PLD in rat EDL muscles. Similarly, in keeping with the possibility that aPKCs operated downstream of ERK and PLD during AICAR action in rat EDL muscles, stimulatory effects of AICAR on aPKC activity, like effects on 2-deoxyglucose uptake, were inhibited by MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, and PLD inhibitor, 1-butanol (Fig. 2). Because a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, viz. PYK2, is required for effects of glucose (13Bandyopadhyay G. Sajan M.P. Kanoh Y. Standaert M.L. Quon M.J. Reed B.C. Dikic I. Farese R.V. J..Biol.

Although a role for DNA methylation in regulating histone acetylation has been established, it is not clear how and whether epigenetic histone markings influence DNA modifications in transcriptional silencing. We have previously shown that induction of histone acetylation by trichostatin A promotes demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA (Cervoni, N., and Szyf, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 40778–40787). The oncoprotein Set/TAF-Iβ is a subunit of the recently identified inhibitor of acetyltransferases complex that inhibits histone acetylation by binding to and masking histone acetyltransferase targets (Seo, S. B., McNamara, P., Heo, S., Turner, A., Lane, W. S., and Chakravarti, D. (2001) Cell 104, 119–130). We show here that the overexpression of Set/TAF-Iβ, whose expression is up-regulated in multiple tumor tissues, inhibits demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA resulting in gene silencing. Overexpression of a mutant Set/TAF-Iβ that does not inhibit histone acetylation is defective in inhibiting DNA demethylation. Taken together, these results are consistent with a novel regulatory role for Set/TAF-Iβ, integrating epigenetic states of histones and DNA in gene regulation and provide a new mechanism that can explain how hypermethylation of specific regions might come about by inhibition of demethylation in cancer cells. Histone hypoacetylation and DNA hypermethylation are hallmarks of gene silencing.

Cedar H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 2725-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms defining the relationship between histone hypoacetylation and DNA hypermethylation are not clear. While it is well accepted that DNA methylation can promote chromatin deacetylation and inactivation (4Razin A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4905-4908Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar), a number of studies suggest that chromatin status can also alter the pattern of DNA methylation. Genome wide demethylation was shown to be induced by n-butyrate, an inhibitor of histone acetylation (5Szyf M. Kaplan F. Mann V. Giloh H. Kedar E. Razin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8653-8656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tichostatin A (TSA),1 an inhibitor of histone deacetylase, was shown to induce selective loss of DNA methylation in Neurospora (6Selker E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9430-9435Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), and very recently disruption of histone methylation was shown to eliminate DNA methylation inNeurospora (7Tamaru H. Selker E.U. Nature. 2001; 414: 277-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that TSA can induce demethylation of ectopically methylated genes (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Hypermethylation of CpG islands has attracted considerable attention as a mechanism responsible for gene silencing during tumor suppression. It is clear that methylation of tumor suppressor genes cannot be explained by the increase in the general level of DNA methyltransferase activity observed in cancer cells. Significant effort has been therefore directed toward identification of factors that recruit DNA methyltransferases to specific promoters. In accordance with this hypothesis, a recent publication demonstrated that the oncogenic transcription factor PML-RAR fusion protein recruits DNMT1 to the retinoic acid βII promoter, resulting in methylation and silencing of this promoter (8Di Croce L. Raker V.A. Corsaro M. Fazi F. Fanelli M. Faretta M. Fuks F., Lo Coco F. Kouzarides T. Nervi C. Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Science. 2002; 295: 1079-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). An alternative potential mechanism of bringing about DNA hypermethylation is inhibition of demethylase activity. This possibility was not previously explored, since it has long been believed that the DNA methylation pattern is controlled exclusively by DNA methyltransferases and that the DNA methylation reaction is irreversible. Nevertheless, we have recently extracted DNA demethylase activity from human lung cancer cell line A549 (9Ramchandani S. Bhattacharya S.K. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6107-6112Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) and have shown that a human embryonal kidney cell line HEK293 possesses active demethylase activity (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The DNA methylation state of a gene in a living cell represents a steady state, and it is hard to determine whether it is a consequence of increased DNA methylation or reduced demethylation. Moreover, it is hard to determine whether demethylation of a gene in a proliferating cell is passive, resulting from inhibition of DNA methylation during DNA synthesis or an active true removal of a methyl group. We have therefore recently developed a transient transfection system that enables studying demethylase activity in cancer cells. A reporter CMV-GFP construct is methylated in vitro by a CpG methyltransferase mSssI and introduced into human transformed HEK293 cells. The plasmid is extracted 96 h after transfection, and its state of methylation is determined by either methylation sensitive restriction enzyme analysis or bisulfite mapping. Since we have demonstrated that this plasmid does not replicate in HEK cells (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), any change in DNA methylation must result from active demethylation. We have also shown that these constructs are notde novo methylated during the transient transfection period, and therefore the transient transfection assay measures exclusively active demethylation in the cell. This system could be utilized to measure the effects of specific proteins on active demethylation of specific sequences in living cells. Using this system we have recently shown that histone acetylation stimulates active demethylation of ectopically methylated reporter constructs. Although we have shown that TSA treatment could potentially stimulate demethylation, this effect is not universal, and it is clear that many methylated genes are neither demethylated nor activated following TSA treatment (10Cameron E.E. Bachman K.E. Myohanen S. Herman J.G. Baylin S.B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (1678) Google Scholar). We therefore reasoned that proteins that inhibit acetylation of histones in response to TSA might also inhibit DNA demethylation. Similar proteins might also inhibit corrective demethylation of spuriously methylated genes and lead to hypermethylation of certain sequences explaining the progressive methylation of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. Recently, experiments performed by Seo et al. (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) led to the discovery of a novel human cellular complex which inhibits the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of transcriptional coactivators p300/CBP and PCAF. This complex called INHAT (inhibitor of acetyltransferases) comprised of the myeloid leukemia-associated oncoprotein SET/TAF-Iβ, the template-activating factor TAF-I∂, and the nuclear phosphoprotein pp32 masks the effect of histone acetyltransferases by binding to histones, thereby inhibiting transcription and serving as a novel mechanism of transcriptional regulation (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). INHAT subunits were shown to individually inhibit histone acetylation. Since INHATs influence the state of histone acetylation (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), and since histone acetylation affects chromatin structure (11Chen H. Tini M. Evans R.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 12Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7652) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that INHATs could directly or indirectly modulate DNA methylation patterns by inhibiting DNA methylation and thus play a role in integrating the status of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and transcriptional silencing. Since Set/TAF-Iβ's association with leukemia suggests a fundamental cellular function perhaps related to neoplastic progression, we focused primarily on the Set/TAF-Iβ oncoprotein in this study. HEK293 cells were plated at a density of 8 × 104/well in a six-well tissue culture dish and transiently transfected with 80 ng of methylated CMV-GFP plasmid DNA alone or cotransfected with up to a maximum of 2 μg of INHAT plasmid DNA (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) per well, using the calcium phosphate precipitation method as described previously (13Rouleau J. Tanigawa G. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7368-7377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfections were performed in five individual wells and were repeated three times using different cultures of HEK293 cells. CMV-GFP plasmid was methylated in vitro by incubating 10 μg of plasmid DNA with 20 units of SssI CpG DNA methyltransferase (14Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glaser G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (New England Biolabs Inc.) in a buffer recommended by the manufacturer containing 160 μm S-adenosylmethionine, at 37 °C for 2 h. After repeating this procedure three times, full protection from HpaII digestion was observed. The assay was performed essentially as described previously (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) utilizing increasing concentrations of wild type Set/TAF-Iβ and mutant Set/TAF-Iβ proteins. In short, ∼1 pmol of baculovirus-expressed and purified p300 was incubated with (Fig. 1 A, lanes 2–4 and6–8) or without (Fig. 1, lanes 1 and5) increasing concentrations of purified wild type or mutant GST-Set/TAF-Iβ as indicated in the legend to Fig. 1 for 5 min at 40 °C before the addition of ∼1 μg of purified core histones and [14C]acetyl-CoA (1000 pmol/μl, Sigma) and incubation continued for an additional 30 min. HAT assays were performed in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate. Reaction products were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a phosphorimager (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). GST alone had no effect in the assay system. Bisulfite mapping was performed as described previously with minor modifications (15Clark S.J. Harrison J. Paul C.L. Frommer M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2990-2997Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). 5 μg of sodium bisulfite-treated DNA samples were subjected to PCR amplification using the first set of primers described below. PCR products were used as templates for subsequent PCR reactions utilizing nested primers. The PCR products of the second reaction were then subcloned using the Invitrogen TA cloning kit (we followed the manufacturer's protocol), and the clones were sequenced using the T7 sequencing kit (AmershamBiosciences; we followed the manufacturer's protocol, procedure C). The primers used for the enhanced green fluorescent protein (pEGFP-1) (CLONTECH) (GenBankTMaccession number U55761) were: GFP5′, 1,5′-gttattatggtgagtaaggg-3′; GFP5′ (nested), 5′-ggggtggtgtttattttgg-3′; GFP3′, 1,5′-tataactattataattatactcca-3′; GFP3′ (nested), 5′-cttataccccaaaatattacc-3′. CHIP assays (16Crane-Robinson C. Myers F.A. Hebbes T.R. Clayton A.L. Thorne A.W. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 304: 533-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were performed by following the Upstate Biotechnology CHIP assay kit protocol (catalog number 17-295). HEK293 cells were transfected with 80 ng of in vitro CMV-GFP plasmid, using the calcium phosphate method (see above). A final concentration of 0.3 μm TSA was added or not added to fresh medium 24 h after transfection. Formaldehyde was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 1%, 96 h post-transfection and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Chromatin was immunoprecipitated using either an anti-acetylated histone H3 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) as recommended by the manufacturer or the anti-Set/TAF-Iβ antibody (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar) or rabbit preimmune serum, as a control. One-tenth of the lysate was kept to quantitate the amount of DNA present in different samples before immunoprecipitation (input). PCR reactions on DNA purified from non-immunoprecipitated samples (input) and immunoprecipitated samples (Ac H, Set/TAF-Iβ, and Pre) were repeated exhaustively using varying amounts of template to ensure that results were within the linear range of the PCR. The following primers were used to amplify the GFP gene: GFP 5′, 5′-caagggcgaggagctgtt-3′; GFP 3′, 5′-cggccatgatatagacgttg3′. Total cell extracts were prepared using standard protocols and resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12.5%). After transferring to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and blocking the non-specific binding with 5% skim milk, GFP protein was detected using rabbit polyclonal IgG (Santa Cruz, sc-8334) at 1:500 dilution, followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma) at 1:5000, and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Set/TAF-Iβ protein was detected as described previously (17Nagata K. Saito S. Okuwaki M. Kawase H. Furuya A. Kusano A. Hanai N. Okuda A. Kikuchi A. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 240: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The matched tumor/normal expression assay membrane was hybridized using a32P-labeled Set/TAF-Iβ cDNA, according to the CLONTECH Laboratories Inc. Matched Tumor/Normal Expression Array User Manual (catalog number 7840-1). To obtain final expression values, each hybridization signal was quantified by densitometry and normalized against signal obtained by hybridization with a cDNA probe for ubiquitin. We utilized a previously described transient transfection-based assay system to study active demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA and the different parameters that might affect it. In prior studies we have shown thatin vitro methylated CMV-GFP reporter plasmid is actively demethylated 72–96 h following transfection into human embryonal kidney HEK293 cells and that this demethylation is dramatically enhanced when histone hyperacetylation is induced pharmacologically with TSA (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). If Set/TAF-Iβ functions by inhibiting histone acetylation, and also functionally interacts with methylated CMV-GFP, then overexpression of Set/TAF-Iβ should inhibit expression of CMV-GFP. To test this, Set/TAF-Iβ plasmid was cotranfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells, with in vitro methylated CMV-GFP plasmid, in the presence or absence of TSA (72 h), and harvested 96 h post-transfection. Cell extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against GFP protein (Fig. 1, B andC) or against the amino-terminal region of the Set/TAF-Iβ oncoprotein (which only recognizes the endogenous and wild type Set/TAF1β construct) (Fig. 1 D). GFP expression is significantly increased in the presence of TSA compared with no TSA treatment (Fig. 1 B) (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar); and in agreement with previous results (2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar), Fig. 1 A shows that while the wild type Set/TAF-Iβ inhibits p300-mediated histone acetylation in a dose-dependent manner, the mutant Set/TAF-Iβ 120–225, which lacks the previously determined HAT inhibitory domain (INHAT domain) and histone binding domain, fails to inhibit histone acetylation (Fig. 1 A and Ref. 2Seo S.B. McNamara P. Heo S. Turner A. Lane W.S. Chakravarti D. Cell. 2001; 104: 119-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Cotransfection with Set/TAF-Iβ (Fig. 1, B and C), but not the mutant Set/TAF-Iβ 120–225 plasmid (Fig. 1 C), attenuated GFP expression to a level that is only slightly above the basal value obtained in the absence of TSA (Fig. 1 B), in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, C andD), establishing a role for the INHAT activity of Set/TAF-Iβ in regulating GFP expression. Since different subunits of the INHAT complex inhibited expression of CMV-GFP, we determined their effect on DNA demethylation induced by TSA (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from HEK293 cells cotransfected with methylated GFP DNA and Set/TAF-Iβ, pp32, or Set/TAF-Iβ 120–225 mutant and was treated with 0.3 μm TSA for 72 h. A map of the analyzed GFP gene is presented in Fig. 2 A. DNA was first linearized with the EcoRI restriction enzyme, followed by digestion with MspI (which cleaves the sequence CCGG) orHpaII (which cleaves the sequence CCGG only when it is not methylated). The results of this experiment demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitor (TSA) treatment alone results in nearly complete demethylation (90%) as indicated by the detection of a fully demethylated HpaII-digested fragment (529 kb) as shown previously (Fig. 2 B, lane 3 and graph bar 1) (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Remarkably, addition of individual INHAT subunits Set/TAF-Iβ and pp32, which block histone acetylation, inhibit demethylation of the reporter gene, as indicated by the 9-fold reduction in the relative abundance of the HpaII-digested fragment with Set/TAF1β (Fig. 2 B, compare lane 3 with lanes 6 and 9, and graph bar 2 versus bar 1). The Set/TAF-Iβ 120–225 mutant, which does not inhibit histone acetylation, had a minimal effect (2-fold) on blocking DNA demethylation (Fig. 2 B, compare lane 12 with lane 6, and graph bar 3). There is a dose-response relationship between demethylation and inhibition of histone acetylation. The relative abundance of the fully demethylated 0.529-kb HpaII fragment was reduced from 95% (with TSA alone) to nearly undetectable levels (6%) with increasing doses of Set/TAF-Iβ (Fig. 2 C, lanes 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, andgraph open circles), but not with the Set/TAF-Iβ 120–225 mutant (Fig. 2 C, lanes 21, 24,27, 30, and graph closed squares). In summary, these experiments demonstrate that INHAT subunits inhibit demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA in a dose-dependent manner. Set/TAF-Iβ might inhibit demethylation of CMV-GFP DNA indirectly by inducing other activities required for demethylation or they might act directly on CMV-GFP by binding to its chromatin and preventing its acetylation and, as a consequence, its demethylation. If Set/TAF-Iβ acts on histones associated with the target DNA, then CMV-GFP DNA associated with Set/TAF-Iβ should remain hypermethylated, whereas DNAs that escaped Set/TAF-Iβ binding should be associated with acetylated histones and hypomethylated (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). To address this issue we used the CHIP assay with anti-acetyl-histone H3 and anti-Set/TAF-Iβ antibodies on cells cotransfected with methylated GFP and 1 μg of Set/TAF-Iβ (a concentration of Set/TAF-Iβ that results in partial inhibition of demethylation as shown in Fig.2 C) and treated with TSA (Fig.3). The results presented in Fig.3 A show that the CMV-GFP gene sequence was immunoprecipitated with both the anti-acetylhistone H3 and anti-Set/TAF-Iβ antibodies but not with preimmune rabbit serum. GFP plasmid DNAs isolated from both acetylhistone H3 and Set/TAF-Iβ-immunoprecipitated samples were then subjected to bisulfite mapping to determine their respective methylation patterns (Fig. 3 B). GFP DNA isolated before immunoprecipitation (Input) was partially demethylated as anticipated (Fig.2 C). All DNAs immunoprecipitated with acetylhistone H3 antibody displayed almost complete demethylation (Fig. 3, Band C). Remarkably, however, DNAs immunoprecipitated with anti-Set/TAF-Iβ antibodies appeared completely hypermethylated except for one demethylated clone. This result shows that Set/TAF-Iβ associates with methylated transfected CMV-GFP chromatin and facilitates the maintenance of the methylated status. To test the hypothesis that the level of expression of INHATs might vary under pathological conditions where aberrations in chromatin acetylation and DNA methylation are commonly observed, we used a cDNA expression array (AtlasTM) containing mRNA from various tumors and their respective non-tumor tissues (Fig. 4). The membrane was hybridized with full-length 32P-labeled Set/TAF-Iβ oncoprotein cDNA and quantified by densitometry. From the multiple samples assayed for each tissue type, an increased expression of Set/TAF-Iβ in certain tumor tissues relative to normal tissues was observed (Fig.4, A–F). The tissue averages from uterus, colon, stomach, and rectum displayed a 2-fold or greater increase in Set/TAF-Iβ expression in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues (Fig.4 G). This paper demonstrates that a chromatin-modifying protein can determine the state of methylation of certain ectopically methylated sequences by inhibiting DNA demethylation. There are several possibilities by which INHAT subunits may regulate DNA methylation. First Set/TAF-Iβ, by virtue of its ability to inhibit histone acetylation, maintains target DNAs in hypoacetylated form. Since histone hyperacetylation is necessary for DNA demethylation of ectopically methylated DNA (1Cervoni N. Szyf M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40778-40787Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), Set/TAF-Iβ-targeted DNAs remain hypermethylated. Second, the histone binding and HAT inhibitory functions of Set/TAF-Iβ are not necessary for its role in the maintenance of DNA hypermethylation. However, the greatly reduced ability of the Set/TAF-Iβ mutant (defective in histone binding and INHAT functions) to protect methylated DNA as compared with the wild type Set/TAF-Iβ eliminates this possibility. Third, INHAT functions by directly recognizing methylated DNAs and protecting them from being targeted by DNA demethylases, which is supported by the fact that the Set/TAF-Iβ mutant still retains a minor ability to inhibit demethylation. Finally INHAT may function by both binding to methylated DNAs and preventing histone acetylation. While the last two remain formal possibilities and are testable, based on our results we suggest a model depicted in Fig. 5 directly linking HAT-inhibitory property, INHAT, in the establishment of an inverse relationship between histone acetylation and DNA methylation in gene silencing. Based on our previous results and the results shown here, we propose that the balance of demethylase and INHATs in cells may therefore determine the final DNA methylation pattern. Histone hypoacetylation due to an elevation in the cellular concentration of factors such as INHATs (Fig. 4 G) may prevent access of demethylases to chromatin, therefore preserving the existing ectopic hypermethylation. This paper identifies for the first time a potential mechanism of inhibition of active demethylation and further supports our previous hypothesis that cancer cells bear a level of demethylase activity that demethylates ectopically methylated sequences. Further extensive experiments are obviously required to test whether such a mechanism participates in precipitating the hypermethylated state of specific tumor suppressor genes. An obvious question that has to be addressed is how could inhibitors of demethylation cause hypermethylation of normally unmethylated genes such as tumor suppressors. We would like to speculate that spurious methylation events do occur during normal replication and that they are normally removed from transcribed genes that are associated with hyperacetylated histones by demethylase(s). Interaction of proteins such as Set/TAF-Iβ with histones associated with a gene lead to inhibition of acetylation, and as a consequence corrective demethylation is inhibited. This can lead to progressive hypermethylation of a gene. In summary, this paper demonstrates that a protein that inhibits histone acetylation also blocks demethylation as well as expression of ectopically methylated DNA. This is to our knowledge the first example of a class of proteins shown to affect a methylation pattern by inhibiting demethylation. These data redirect our understanding of how DNA methylation patterns are generated, maintained, and pathologically altered in cancer and provide novel potential targets for regulation of aberrant methylation patterns, such as those found in tumors or transformed cells. While our experiments suggest that Set/TAF-Iβ could potentially affect DNA methylation states by inhibiting demethylation, further experiments will be necessary to demonstrate that hypermethylation of specific tumor suppressor genes involves interaction with proteins like Set/TAF-Iβ. We are currently searching for endogenous genes targeted by INHATs, to test our model and confirm the results of our transient system. Other important questions that have to be resolved are what are the mechanisms responsible for up-regulation of Set/TAF-Iβ during tumorigenesis and what may target Set/TAF-Iβ to certain genes and not others? Nevertheless, our data illustrates some of the first principles integrating the process of demethylation, histone hypoacetylation, and DNA hypermethylation in the establishment of silent chromatin loci."

FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The polypeptide sequences of members of this family are made up of three related domains of about 100 amino acids repeated in tandem, each probably being folded into twotrans-membrane α-helices connected by an extensive hydrophilic loop. The repeats in the various family members are all related, and various sequence features are conserved (1Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). So far 14 mitochondrial carriers have been identified and sequenced from yeast and animals (see Ref. 3Fiermonte F. Palmieri L. Todisco S. Agrimi G. Palmieri F. Walker J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19289-19294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar and references therein). The functions of many other family members found in genomic sequences are unknown. In plants, many transport activities observed in mitochondria and/or in liposomes reconstituted with more or less purified protein fractions await to be associated with specific protein sequences (for a review see Ref. 4Laloi M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 918-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These include the transport of specific dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates, which is required in several metabolic processes such as primary amino acid synthesis (e.g. nitrate/ammonium assimilation), export of reducing equivalents (e.g. for photorespiration), fatty acid metabolism (e.g. lipid mobilization and fatty acid elongation), gluconeogenesis, and isoprenoid biosynthesis (5Wiskich J.T.

Indeed, cDNAs encoding the adenine nucleotide carrier, the uncoupling protein, and the phosphate carrier have been isolated from various plants based on the high homology with their orthologs in other organisms (15Baker A. Leaver C.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 5857-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Laloi M. Klein M. Riesmeier J.W. Muller-Rober B. Fleury C. Bouillaud F. Ricquier D.

The latter two carriers have been identified also from their transport properties upon expression in Escherichia coli and reconstitution into liposomes (18Borecky J. Maia I.G. Costa A.D. Jezek P.

Finally, a malate translocator from Panicum miliaceum has been overexpressed, reconstituted, and inferred to be the plant ortholog of the bovine oxoglutarate/malate carrier, although the identity between them is low (32%) (20Taniguchi M. Sugiyama T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Taniguchi M. Sugiyama T. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this paper, the identification and characterization of the plant mitochondrial dicarboxylate-tricarboxylate carrier (DTC)1 is described. It is based on the identification of a cDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana and four cDNAs from Nicotiana tabacumencoding proteins related to the bovine oxoglutarate-malate carrier (22Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). These proteins have the characteristic features of the mitochondrial carrier family and are 83–84% identical in their sequences. They were overexpressed in bacteria, purified, and reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles, where they transport dicarboxylates (such as oxoglutarate, oxaloacetate, malate, and succinate) and tricarboxylates (such as citrate, isocitrate,cis-aconitate, and trans-aconitate) by a counter exchange mechanism. From their transport properties and phylogenetic analysis, it is concluded that these proteins are isoforms/orthologs of a novel mitochondrial transporter named DTC. A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia), N. tabacum cv.xanthi, Nicotiana tomentosiformis, andNicotiana sylvestris were grown in a greenhouse under long day conditions (16 h of light/8 h of dark).

All of the radiolabeled probes were generated by random priming with the T7 Quick-primeTMkit (Amersham Biosciences) and [32P]dCTP (AmershamBiosciences). The membranes were autoradiographed at −70 °C for several days with an intensifying screen. The coding sequences of NtDTC1, NtDTC2,NtDTC3, and AtDTC were amplified from the respective cDNAs by PCR. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide primers were synthesized corresponding to the extremities of the DTC coding sequences with additional NdeI and EcoRI sites, respectively. PCR products were cloned asNdeI/EcoRI fragments into the pMW7 expression vector. The resulting constructs were used to transform E. coli C0214(DE3) cells, and recombinant DTC proteins were overproduced as inclusion bodies at 37 °C as described before (28Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. Del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J. Walker J.E. Saheki T. Satrústegui J. Palmieri F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5060-5069Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Inclusion bodies were purified on a sucrose density gradient (22Fiermonte G. Walker J.E. Palmieri F. Biochem.

DTC proteins were solubilized in 2.5% (w/v) sarkosyl, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and a small insoluble residue was removed by centrifugation at 258,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The recombinant proteins in sarkosyl were reconstituted into liposomes in the presence of substrates, as described previously (29Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). 1.43 mg/ml of soybean asolectin (Fluka) was included in the reconstitution mixture for optimal transport activity. External substrate was removed from proteoliposomes on Sephadex G-75 columns. Transport at 25 °C was started by adding [14C]oxoglutarate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), [14C]malate, or [14C]citrate (AmershamBiosciences) to the proteoliposomes and terminated after 20 s by the addition of 30 mm pyridoxal 5′-phosphate and 10 mm bathophenanthroline (the “inhibitor-stop” method) (29Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 349-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In controls, the inhibitors were added with the labeled substrate. The transport measurements were carried out at the same internal and external pH values of 6.0 (except where otherwise indicated). External radioactivity was removed from quenched samples on Sephadex G-75, and the internal radioactivity was measured (29Palmieri F. Indiveri C. Bisaccia F. Iacobazzi V.

K+ diffusion potentials were generated using valinomycin and K+ gradients. In these experiments the reconstitution mixture contained 0.71 mg/ml of cardiolipin (Sigma) besides soybean asolectin. Recombinant NtDTC2 protein with an MHHHHHHTM N-terminal extension was produced in E. coliBL21(DE3) cells, purified as described in Ref. 23Lancien M. Ferrario-Mery S. Roux Y. Masclaux-Daubresse C.

Submitochondrial fractions of potato tubers were prepared as described in (30Remy R. Ambard-Bretteville F. Colas des Francs C. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 528-532Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue dye. The yield of the purified recombinant proteins per liter of bacterial culture was estimated by laser densitometry (28Palmieri L. Pardo B. Lasorsa F.M. Del Arco A. Kobayashi K. Iijima M. Runswick M.J.

With all DTCs the efficiency of reconstitution (i.e. the share of successfully incorporated protein) varied between 18 and 23% of the protein added to the reconstitution mixture in all experiments. Protein transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes and immunodetection were performed as described in Ref. 24Gálvez S. Hodges M. Decottignies P. Bismuth E. Lancien M. Sangwan R.S. Dubois F.

Palmieri F. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) was used to search data bases for homologous plant sequences. In this way anA. thaliana EST (GenBankTM accession numberZ26469), named AtDTC, was identified. Sequencing showed that it contained a 897-bp open reading frame, encoding a polypeptide of 298 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31.9 kDa.AtDTC was used to screen a N. tabacum cDNA library, and four different cDNAs were identified (namedNtDTC1 to NtDTC4). They were classed into two groups containing NtDTC1 with NtDTC2 andNtDTC3 with NtDTC4. Analysis of NtDTC1 showed an 894-bp open reading frame that encoded a 297-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 31.7 kDa. TheNtDTC2 cDNA was not complete, lacking six nucleotides after the start codon as well as a 5′-untranslated region. There was 99% amino acid identity between NtDTC1 andNtDTC2. In the second group, NtDTC3 gave a 903-bp open reading frame that encoded a 300-amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 32.1 kDa. NtDTC4 was not a complete cDNA, containing only a 682-bp coding region. There was 98% amino acid identity between NtDTC3 andNtDTC4. When the two groups of tobacco DTCs were compared, an amino acid identity of 91% was found. NtDTC1/2 andNtDTC3 exhibited 84 and 83% identity with AtDTC, respectively. Both AtDTC and the NtDTCs exhibit the hydrophobic profile, the tripartite structure, and the sequence motifs that are characteristic of the mitochondrial carrier family (1Palmieri F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 346: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). An analysis of the Arabidopsis nucleotide sequence data base showed the presence of a single AtDTC gene located on chromosome V (GenBankTM accession numberAF296838). The restriction enzymes EcoRI, BamHI, and HindIII, which do not have recognition sites within this gene, were used to digest A. thaliana genomic DNA. These digests produced a single fragment that hybridized with theAtDTC probe (Fig.1 A), thus confirming that theArabidopsis genome contains a single copy of theAtDTC gene. The four NtDTCs were isolated fromN. tabacum, an amphidiploid species derived from ancestors that are closely related to the present-day species N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis. Therefore, Southern analyses were performed using genomic DNA from N. tabacum,N. sylvestris, and N. tomentosiformis. A number of hybridizing bands were detected in the different tobacco genomes when using a nonspecific NtDTC probe, thus confirming that several distinct genes encode DTC in tobacco (Fig. 1 B). Indeed, it appeared that N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis contained at least two DTC genes, whereas theN. tabacum pattern was the sum of these two genomes. Southern blotting with a specific NtDTC4 probe and PCR analyses carried out on genomic DNA using gene-specific oligonucleotide primers revealed that NtDTC2/3 and NtDTC1/4 were encoded by the N. sylvestris and N. tomentosiformis genomes, respectively (data not shown). Amino acid sequence comparisons revealed that AtDTC and the NtDTCs showed the highest degree of similarity with other plant proteins. For example, NtDTC1 exhibited 94% identity with a putative potato oxoglutarate-malate carrier (GenBankTM accession number X99853) and 81% identity with the millet malate transporter (20Taniguchi M. Sugiyama T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 30: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Among mitochondrial transporters from other organisms, the tobacco DTCs showed the highest homology with the mitochondrial oxoglutarate-malate carriers sharing 41–42% identical amino acids with this carrier from bovine (22Fiermonte G.

DNA Sequence. 1994; 5: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), andCaenorhabditis elegans (GenBankTM accession number P90992). A phylogenetic analysis carried out usingAtDTC, NtDTC1–4, and the sequences of four groups of mitochondrial transporters (i.e. the oxoglutarate-malate carrier (OGC), dicarboxylate (DIC), and tricarboxylate (CTP) carriers, and the uncoupling (UCP) proteins) revealed that AtDTC and the NtDTCs were more closely related to the OGC group (Fig.2). However, DTCs and OGCs form two clearly distinct clusters. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of two distinct DTC subgroups in tobacco (made up of the homologous DTC proteins from each of the two N. tabacum genomes) that appear to have originated from a recent gene duplication event. The expression of DTC in A. thaliana and N. tabacum was examined in different tissues by Northern blot analysis. The presence of DTC transcripts was found in all plant tissues examined, although at different levels (Fig. 3). InArabidopsis, the flower bud showed the highest DTC transcript levels, whereas the root had the lowest (Fig.3 A). In N. tabacum DTC expression in flower bud and root appeared to be comparable; the highest transcript levels were detected in sepal, petal, male, and female tissues, whereas somewhat lower amounts were found in leaf and stem (Fig. 3 B). Although we were unable to distinguish between the different tobacco DTCs with the probe used in Fig. 3, reverse transcription-PCR experiments using gene-specific primers indicated that each tobacco DTC gene was expressed in the different organs/tissues analyzed (data not shown). Organic acids produced in the mitochondria are required for ammonium assimilation via the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway located in the plastids (33Gálvez S. Lancien M. Hodges M. Trends Plant Sci. 1999; 4: 484-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Previous work has shown a coordinated expression of certain genes (NAD-dependent isocitric dehydrogenase, nitrate reductase, and glutamine synthetase) when nitrate is supplied to nitrogen-starved tobacco plants (23Lancien M. Ferrario-Mery S. Roux Y. Masclaux-Daubresse C. Hirel B. Gadal P. Hodges M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to investigate whether DTC expression varied under the same conditions. The effect of nitrate supply to tobacco plants that were nitrogen-starved for 4 days was investigated in roots (Fig. 4 A) and deveined leaves (Fig. 4 B) by Northern blot analysis as described in Ref. 23Lancien M. Ferrario-Mery S. Roux Y. Masclaux-Daubresse C. Hirel B. Gadal P. Hodges M. Plant Physiol. 1999; 120: 717-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. In both tissues, nitrate resupply led to an increase inNtDTC mRNA steady-state levels (Fig. 4). To study whether the DTC protein is located in the membranes of plant mitochondria, a His6-tagged NtDTC2 protein was purified by affinity chromatography (Fig. 5,lane 1) and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits. The antibodies recognized the recombinant DTC protein as shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 5, lane 5). DTC could not be detected in crude tobacco leaf extracts (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and6). In contrast, a prominent immunoreactive band of about 32 kDa was observed using purified mitochondria from potato tubers. To examine the submitochondrial location of DTC, integral membrane proteins were separated from soluble and peripheral proteins of potato mitochondria by carbonate treatment (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and4, respectively). The 32-kDa band was found only in the membrane fraction (Fig. 5, lanes 3 and 7). Therefore, DTC is an integral mitochondrial membrane protein. The antiserum cross-reacted with another protein of about 60 kDa. However, this protein is not related to DTC because it was still recognized when the immunoreaction was carried out in the presence of soluble recombinant NtDTC2 (not shown). To study their functional properties,NtDTC1–3 and AtDTC proteins were expressed at high levels in E. coli C0214 (DE3). They accumulated as inclusion bodies and were purified by centrifugation and washing with a yield of 80–100 mg of purified protein/liter of bacterial culture. Neither protein was detected in bacteria harvested immediately before induction of expression or in control (with only vector) cells harvested after induction (not shown). The identity of the expressed proteins was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing and Western blotting. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with the recombinant DTC proteins from tobacco and A. thaliana catalyzed an active counterexchange of external [14C]oxoglutarate for internal oxoglutarate (Table I). No activity was detected with DTC proteins that had been boiled before incorporation into liposomes. Similarly, no oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange was detected by reconstitution of sarkosyl-solubilized material from bacterial cells either lacking the DTC expression vector or harvested immediately before induction of expression. Furthermore, no uptake was observed of external [14C]oxoglutarate into liposomes that did not contain internal oxoglutarate, indicating that reconstituted DTCs do not catalyze unidirectional transport (uniport).Table IDependence on internal substrate of the transport properties of proteoliposomes reconstituted with bacterially expressed NtDTC1, NtDTC3, or the AtDTCInternal substrate[14C]Oxoglutarate uptake NtDTC1 NtDTC3 AtDTC mmol/min/g proteinNone (Cl−present)0.040.010.02Oxoglutarate4.120.251.18Oxoadipate1.470.030.58l-Malate5.050.221.63Succinate3.420.271.26Maleate4.960.371.29Fumarate0.060.010.02Oxaloacetate3.750.301.99Malonate5.050.281.93Citrate3.080.181.07l-Isocitrate2.390.100.33 cis-Aconitate2.370.110.65 trans-Aconitate3.950.150.73Phosphoenolpyruvate0.030.000.03Sulfate2.450.080.46Phosphate0.010.020.04Pyruvate0.040.000.01Glutamate0.130.000.02Proteoliposomes were preloaded internally with various substrates (concentration, 20 mm).

Transport was started by the external addition of 0.1 mm [14C]oxoglutarate and terminated after 20 s. Similar results were obtained in four independent experiments. The substrate specificity of the tobacco and A. thalianareconstituted proteins was investigated in detail by measuring the uptake of [14C]oxoglutarate into proteoliposomes that had been preloaded with potential substrates. As shown in Table I, the highest activities were detected in the presence of internal 2-oxoglutarate, malate, maleate, oxaloacetate, succinate, or malonate. Interestingly, citrate, isocitrate, cis-aconitate,trans-aconitate, and sulfate were exchanged for external 2-oxoglutarate, although to a slightly lower extent than the dicarboxylates. No significant exchange was detected with internal fumarate, phosphoenolpyruvate, phosphate, pyruvate, glutamate (TableI), aspartate, glutamine, carnitine, ornithine, or ADP (not shown). Similar results were obtained with NtDTC2 (data not shown). The ability of nonradioactive substrates (at a concentration of 4 mm) to inhibit the uptake of 0.2 mm[14C]oxoglutarate into proteoliposomes containing 20 mm oxoglutarate and reconstituted with the DTC proteins was also examined. The oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange was inhibited by the external addition of 2-oxoglutarate, malate, maleate oxaloacetate, succinate, malonate, citrate, isocitrate,cis-aconitate, and trans-aconitate (70–95% inhibition) and, to a lesser extent (35–40%), by oxoadipate. Sulfate, a potential DTC substrate (Table I), had a very low inhibitory effect (<20%), indicating that the reconstituted DTC proteins have a very low affinity for sulfate, at least at the external surface of the proteoliposomes. Phosphoenolpyruvate, fumarate, phosphate, pyruvate, glutamate, ornithine, carnitine, and ADP had a very limited inhibitory effect, if any. Therefore, the substrate specificity of the plant DTC proteins appears to be broader than that of known oxoglutarate-malate carriers, because DTC accepts both dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates. The [14C]oxoglutarate/oxoglutarate exchange in proteoliposomes reconstituted with the tobacco and A. thaliana DTC proteins was inhibited strongly (61–98%) by organic mercurials, such as mersalyl (0.1 mm) andp-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate (0.1 mm), and by bathophenanthroline (1 mm) (inhibitors of several mitochondrial carriers). The impermeable dicarboxylate butylmalonate (2 mm), an inhibitor of the dicarboxylate and oxoglutarate/malate carriers (34Palmieri F. Prezioso G. Quagliariello E. Klingenberg M. Eur. J.

In contrast,N-ethylmaleimide (1 mm), α-cyanocinnamate (0.1 mm), and carboxylatractyloside (0.02 mm), known inhibitors of the phosphate, pyruvate, and ADP/ATP carriers, respectively, had no effect on the activities of the reconstituted DTC protein"

https://openalex.org/W1914212739,"SU6668 is a small molecule inhibitor of the angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinases Flk-1/KDR, PDGFRbeta, and FGFR1. In mice, SU6668 treatment resulted in regression or growth arrest of all large established human tumor xenografts examined associated with loss of tumor cellularity. The events underlying loss of tumor cellularity were elucidated in detail in several tumor models. SU6668 treatment induced apoptosis in tumor microvessels within 6 h of the initiation of treatment. Dose-dependent decreases in tumor microvessel density were observed within 3 days of the first treatment. These changes were accompanied by decreased tumor cell proliferation and increased tumor cell apoptosis. Rapid increases in VEGF transcript levels were seen, consistent with the induction of tumor hypoxia. Using Western blot analyses, we determined that these in vivo antiangiogenic and proapoptotic effects of SU6668 occur at doses comparable to those required to inhibit Flk-1/KDR and PDGFRbeta phosphorylation in tumors. Potent, dose-dependent inhibition of Flk-1/KDR activity in vivo was independently demonstrated using vascular permeability as a readout. These data demonstrate that SU6668-induced inhibition of angiogenic receptor tyrosine kinase activity in vivo is associated with rapid vessel killing in tumors, leading to broad and potent antitumor effects."

However, the molecular mechanisms of tissue factor gene expression triggered by CD40 ligand (CD40L) in this cell type remain unknown. We demonstrate here that the tissue factor promoter region −278 bp to +121 bp contains the CD40L-responsive elements, consisting of activator protein 1 (AP-1)±, nuclear factor (NF) κB-, and Egr-1-binding sites. Mutations of either the AP-1- or NF-κB-binding sites markedly reduced the CD40L-dependent promoter activation. The AP-1 and NF-κB sites displayed constitutive and CD40L-enhanceable DNA binding activity, respectively. Of note, mutation of the Egr-1-binding sites, previously not associated with CD40 signaling, impaired activation of the tissue factor promoter. Accordingly, CD40L strongly induced Egr-1 protein expression and DNA binding activity to all three bindings sites. In contrast to CD40L, other established inducers of tissue factor in endothelial cells, interleukin-1β or tumor necrosis factor α, did not increase the expression of Egr-1. In conclusion, induction of tissue factor gene expression in human endothelial cells by CD40L involves AP-1 and NF-κB as well as Egr-1, a pathway previously not implicated in CD40 signaling and distinct from that employed by certain other proinflammatory cytokines.

For well over a century pathologists have recognized that altered endothelial coagulant potential contributes to thrombotic diathesis. Understanding the molecular details of endothelial coagulability has emerged recently. Expression of procoagulants on the surface of endothelial cells (EC),1 the cell type at the blood interface, has attracted particular attention in this regard. Tissue factor (TF), a 47-kDa membrane-bound glycoprotein, serves as a key initiator of blood coagulation. Of note, EC express little or no TF constitutively in vitro and in vivo. However, levels of this procoagulant increase markedly in the endothelium of the diseased vasculature (3Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Brand K. Ruf W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar).Despite its potential pathophysiologic role, knowledge regarding the regulation of TF gene activity in EC remains incomplete. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), vascular endothelial growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induce the expression of this procoagulant in EC (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmuller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transcriptional regulation of TF expression in different cell types appears to involve distinct signaling pathways (6Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Functional studies of the human TF promoter in various cell types, including EC, identified two promoter regions implicated in TF gene expression. The first region, termed the LPS-response element (LRE), contains two activator protein-1 (AP-1)- and one nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-like binding sites. The LRE mediates inducibility of the TF promoter in response to proinflammatory stimuli (e.g. IL-1β and TNFα), LPS, and PMA (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Oeth P.A.

The second region, the serum-response region (SRR), contains three Egr-1-binding sites. This region mediates the induction of TF gene expression via Egr-1 in response to serum, PMA, shear stress, low density lipoprotein, hypoxia, vascular endothelial growth factor, and LPS (5Mechtcheriakova D.

Thus, the molecular pathways employed to activate the TF gene appear to depend on the stimulus applied, e.g. proinflammatory cytokines appear not to signal via the Egr-1-binding sites located in the SRR.Recently, we and others have identified the immunomodulatory dyad CD40/CD40L as a novel regulator of TF protein and activity in various cell types, including EC, in vitro and in vivo(15Mach F.

Further supporting the potential role of CD40L in the modulation of the thrombotic balance of EC, CD40 ligation diminishes the expression of thrombomodulin by this cell type, the “anticoagulant” receptor for thrombin (16Miller D.L.

Moreover, in human and experimental atheroma, the expression of CD40L correlates and co-localizes with that of TF in vivo (19Schönbeck U. Mach F. Sukhova G.K. Herman M. Graber P. Kehry M.R. Libby P.

The CD40 signaling mechanisms mediating TF expression in this cell type, however, remain unknown. Therefore, the present study characterized thecis-acting regulatory elements, which mediate the CD40L-induced TF promoter activity in EC.DISCUSSIONVarious lines of evidence support a role for CD40 signaling in regulating the thrombotic balance in blood vessels (15Mach F.

Circulation. 1999; 100: 1215-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the molecular pathways of CD40L-induced TF expression have remained unknown. We demonstrate here that optimal induction of TF expression in human EC requires not only binding activity of AP-1 and NF-κB family members but also of Egr-1, a transcription factor previously not associated with CD40 signaling and not employed by other established mediators of TF expression, namely IL-1β and TNFα (Fig.7).Promoter-reporter gene studies employing 5′-deletion constructs localized CD40L-sensitive elements to a region downstream of −278 bp in the human TF promoter. This region contains the recognized LRE as well as the SRR containing the main regulatory cis-elements for TF gene expression (AP-1 and NF-κB as well as Egr-1-binding sites, respectively) (6Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Notably, induction of TF promoter activity by proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNFα, utilizes binding sites located in the LRE (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whereas those in the SRR are employed by mediators, such as serum, shear stress, hypoxia, and vascular endothelial growth factor (5Mechtcheriakova D.

Of further interest, heretofore only PMA and LPS have been reported to utilize both elements, LRE and SRR, to induce TF gene expression (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Notably, the constitutive binding of c-Jun and JunD to the AP-1 sites of the TF promoter was not affected by CD40L, whereas CD40 ligation markedly enhanced the binding of c-Rel/p65 proteins to the NF-κB site (Fig. 3). The constitutive binding of c-Jun and JunD proteins to the AP-1 sites agrees with the basal TF promoter activity. Nevertheless, CD40L-induced phosphorylation of bound c-Jun by the stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (26Karmann K. Hughes C.C. Schechner J. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. Proc. Natl.

The CD40L-dependent activation of NF-κB binding to the TF promoter most likely depends on the inactivation of IκBα via IKK as demonstrated for other cytokines in various cell types, including EC (28Bennett B.L. Lacson R.G. Chen C.C. Cruz R. Wheeler J.S. Kletzien R.F. Tomasselli A.G. Heinrikson R.L. Manning A.M. J. Biol.

The requirement for members of both the AP-1 and NF-κB/Rel transcription factor family to maximally induce the TF promoter by CD40L might indicate the necessity of cooperative binding of c-Jun/JunD to the AP-1 sites and c-Rel/p65 to the NF-κB site, both located closely in the LRE of the TF promoter. This hypothesis gains support from recent studies that demonstrated interaction of c-Jun as well as JunD with p65 exhibiting enhanced functional DNA binding activity (30Stein B.

Bernuau D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5132-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, modifying the spacing between the AP-1 sites and the NF-κB site in the LRE by insertion of additional base pairs abolished induction of the TF promoter by LPS in monocytes (32Oeth P. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar).We further tested whether CD40L, besides PMA and LPS, might utilize binding sites in both elements, LRE and SRR, for optimal induction of TF gene expression, indicating that CD40 signaling differs from that of previously studied proinflammatory mediators, e.g. IL-1β and TNFα. In contrast to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β or TNFα, CD40L suprisingly induced Egr-1 protein expression and DNA binding activity in EC, notably to a degree similar to that achieved by PMA. Although a recent report suggested the activation of Egr-1 by TNFα in EC (33Mechtcheriakova D. Schabbauer G. Lucerna M. Clauss M., De Martin R. Binder B.R. Hofer E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), lack of Egr-1 inducibility via TNFα in this cell type reported here is in accordance with the previous report of Pendurthi et al. (25Pendurthi U.R. Williams J.T. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Notably, all three Egr-1-binding sites located downstream of the LRE in the human TF promoter appear to function in CD40L-mediated TF expression.Therefore, optimal induction of the TF promoter by CD40L in EC probably requires not only interaction with the transcription factors of the AP-1 and c-Rel/NF-κB families but also Egr-1. The finding that members of all three transcription factor families participate in the induction of TF expression agrees with recent observations in LPS-stimulated monocytic cells (14Guha M. O'Connell M.A. Pawlinski R. Hollis A. McGovern P. Yan S.F. Stern D. Mackman N. Blood. 2001; 98: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar).The present findings indicate that CD40 ligation on EC results in broader activation of intracellular signaling pathways targeting the TF gene than the “classical” cytokines IL-1β and TNFα. This finding may further help to understand why CD40L activates certain genes (e.g. caspase-1 (ICE) andstromelysin-3) (21Schönbeck U. Mach F. Sukhova G.K. Atkinson E. Levesque E. Herman M. Graber P.

Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of CD40L signaling pathways might provide new therapeutic options to prevent thrombotic complications in inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis. Thrombosis, resulting in complete or partial vessel occlusion, plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis and thromboembolism (1Fuster V. Badimon I. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 242-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar, 2Fuster V. Badimon L. Badimon J.J. Chesebro J.H. N. Engl. J. Med. 1992; 326: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (1393) Google Scholar). Intravascular coagulation also complicates conditions such as septic shock. For well over a century pathologists have recognized that altered endothelial coagulant potential contributes to thrombotic diathesis. Understanding the molecular details of endothelial coagulability has emerged recently. Expression of procoagulants on the surface of endothelial cells (EC),1 the cell type at the blood interface, has attracted particular attention in this regard. Tissue factor (TF), a 47-kDa membrane-bound glycoprotein, serves as a key initiator of blood coagulation. Of note, EC express little or no TF constitutively in vitro and in vivo. However, levels of this procoagulant increase markedly in the endothelium of the diseased vasculature (3Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Brand K. Ruf W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1991; 66: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Despite its potential pathophysiologic role, knowledge regarding the regulation of TF gene activity in EC remains incomplete. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), vascular endothelial growth factor, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induce the expression of this procoagulant in EC (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 5Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmuller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the transcriptional regulation of TF expression in different cell types appears to involve distinct signaling pathways (6Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Functional studies of the human TF promoter in various cell types, including EC, identified two promoter regions implicated in TF gene expression. The first region, termed the LPS-response element (LRE), contains two activator protein-1 (AP-1)- and one nuclear factor κB (NF-κB)-like binding sites. The LRE mediates inducibility of the TF promoter in response to proinflammatory stimuli (e.g. IL-1β and TNFα), LPS, and PMA (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 612-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 7Mackman N. Brand K. Edgington T.S. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 1517-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 8Oeth P.A. Parry G.C. Kunsch C. Nantermet P. Rosen C.A. Mackman N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3772-3781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The second region, the serum-response region (SRR), contains three Egr-1-binding sites. This region mediates the induction of TF gene expression via Egr-1 in response to serum, PMA, shear stress, low density lipoprotein, hypoxia, vascular endothelial growth factor, and LPS (5Mechtcheriakova D.

Thus, the molecular pathways employed to activate the TF gene appear to depend on the stimulus applied, e.g. proinflammatory cytokines appear not to signal via the Egr-1-binding sites located in the SRR. Recently, we and others have identified the immunomodulatory dyad CD40/CD40L as a novel regulator of TF protein and activity in various cell types, including EC, in vitro and in vivo(15Mach F.

Further supporting the potential role of CD40L in the modulation of the thrombotic balance of EC, CD40 ligation diminishes the expression of thrombomodulin by this cell type, the “anticoagulant” receptor for thrombin (16Miller D.L. Yaron R. Yellin M.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 17Slupsky J.R. Kalbas M. Willuweit A. Henn V. Kroczek R.A. Muller-Berghaus G. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 1008-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Moreover, in human and experimental atheroma, the expression of CD40L correlates and co-localizes with that of TF in vivo (19Schönbeck U. Mach F. Sukhova G.K. Herman M. Graber P. Kehry M.R. Libby P.

Although many cell types can express TF, EC occupy a central position in the homeostasis of blood coagulation as they provide the contact surface of the tissue with coagulation factors containing blood. The CD40 signaling mechanisms mediating TF expression in this cell type, however, remain unknown. Therefore, the present study characterized thecis-acting regulatory elements, which mediate the CD40L-induced TF promoter activity in EC. DISCUSSIONVarious lines of evidence support a role for CD40 signaling in regulating the thrombotic balance in blood vessels (15Mach F. Schönbeck U. Bonnefoy J.Y. Pober J.S. Libby P.

We demonstrate here that optimal induction of TF expression in human EC requires not only binding activity of AP-1 and NF-κB family members but also of Egr-1, a transcription factor previously not associated with CD40 signaling and not employed by other established mediators of TF expression, namely IL-1β and TNFα (Fig.7).Promoter-reporter gene studies employing 5′-deletion constructs localized CD40L-sensitive elements to a region downstream of −278 bp in the human TF promoter. This region contains the recognized LRE as well as the SRR containing the main regulatory cis-elements for TF gene expression (AP-1 and NF-κB as well as Egr-1-binding sites, respectively) (6Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Notably, induction of TF promoter activity by proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNFα, utilizes binding sites located in the LRE (4Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Notably, the constitutive binding of c-Jun and JunD to the AP-1 sites of the TF promoter was not affected by CD40L, whereas CD40 ligation markedly enhanced the binding of c-Rel/p65 proteins to the NF-κB site (Fig. 3). The constitutive binding of c-Jun and JunD proteins to the AP-1 sites agrees with the basal TF promoter activity. Nevertheless, CD40L-induced phosphorylation of bound c-Jun by the stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (26Karmann K. Hughes C.C. Schechner J. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. Proc. Natl.

Promoter reporter gene studies demonstrated the involvement of AP-1- and NF-κB-binding sites in CD40L-mediated TF expression, in common with other proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β and TNFα (6Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Notably, the constitutive binding of c-Jun and JunD to the AP-1 sites of the TF promoter was not affected by CD40L, whereas CD40 ligation markedly enhanced the binding of c-Rel/p65 proteins to the NF-κB site (Fig. 3). The constitutive binding of c-Jun and JunD proteins to the AP-1 sites agrees with the basal TF promoter activity. Nevertheless, CD40L-induced phosphorylation of bound c-Jun by the stress-activated protein kinase c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (26Karmann K. Hughes C.C. Schechner J. Fanslow W.C. Pober J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4342-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) might contribute to increased transcriptional activity of c-Jun (27Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). The CD40L-dependent activation of NF-κB binding to the TF promoter most likely depends on the inactivation of IκBα via IKK as demonstrated for other cytokines in various cell types, including EC (28Bennett B.L. Lacson R.G. Chen C.C. Cruz R. Wheeler J.S. Kletzien R.F. Tomasselli A.G. Heinrikson R.L. Manning A.M. J. Biol.

The requirement for members of both the AP-1 and NF-κB/Rel transcription factor family to maximally induce the TF promoter by CD40L might indicate the necessity of cooperative binding of c-Jun/JunD to the AP-1 sites and c-Rel/p65 to the NF-κB site, both located closely in the LRE of the TF promoter. This hypothesis gains support from recent studies that demonstrated interaction of c-Jun as well as JunD with p65 exhibiting enhanced functional DNA binding activity (30Stein B. Baldwin A.S., Jr. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C. Angel P. Herrlich P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3879-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar,31Rahmani M. Peron P. Weitzman J. Bakiri L. Lardeux B. Bernuau D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5132-5142Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In addition, modifying the spacing between the AP-1 sites and the NF-κB site in the LRE by insertion of additional base pairs abolished induction of the TF promoter by LPS in monocytes (32Oeth P. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We further tested whether CD40L, besides PMA and LPS, might utilize binding sites in both elements, LRE and SRR, for optimal induction of TF gene expression, indicating that CD40 signaling differs from that of previously studied proinflammatory mediators, e.g. IL-1β and TNFα. In contrast to the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β or TNFα, CD40L suprisingly induced Egr-1 protein expression and DNA binding activity in EC, notably to a degree similar to that achieved by PMA. Although a recent report suggested the activation of Egr-1 by TNFα in EC (33Mechtcheriakova D. Schabbauer G. Lucerna M. Clauss M., De Martin R. Binder B.R. Hofer E. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), lack of Egr-1 inducibility via TNFα in this cell type reported here is in accordance with the previous report of Pendurthi et al. (25Pendurthi U.R. Williams J.T. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Notably, all three Egr-1-binding sites located downstream of the LRE in the human TF promoter appear to function in CD40L-mediated TF expression. Therefore, optimal induction of the TF promoter by CD40L in EC probably requires not only interaction with the transcription factors of the AP-1 and c-Rel/NF-κB families but also Egr-1. The finding that members of all three transcription factor families participate in the induction of TF expression agrees with recent observations in LPS-stimulated monocytic cells (14Guha M. O'Connell M.A. Pawlinski R. Hollis A. McGovern P. Yan S.F. Stern D. Mackman N. Blood. 2001; 98: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The present findings indicate that CD40 ligation on EC results in broader activation of intracellular signaling pathways targeting the TF gene than the “classical” cytokines IL-1β and TNFα. This finding may further help to understand why CD40L activates certain genes (e.g. caspase-1 (ICE) andstromelysin-3) (21Schönbeck U. Mach F. Sukhova G.K. Atkinson E. Levesque E. Herman M. Graber P.

The present results provide new insight into the transcriptional regulation of endothelial TF expression following CD40 ligation and illustrate a role for Egr-1 activation in the regulation of the thrombogenic potential of endothelial cells by CD40L. Thus, pharmacologic inhibition of CD40L signaling pathways might provide new therapeutic options to prevent thrombotic complications in inflammatory processes such as atherosclerosis.

https://openalex.org/W2011053169,"Endostatin is an anti-angiogenic factor that inhibits endothelial cell (EC) migration and induces EC apoptosis. Because nitric oxide (NO) plays a key role in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis, we hypothesized that endostatin interferes with the activation of the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Human recombinant endostatin significantly reduced VEGF-induced NO-release, which suggests that endostatin inhibits eNOS activation. Because the activation of eNOS by VEGF is associated with the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177, we investigated whether endostatin interferes with phosphorylation of eNOS. Endostatin reduced VEGF-induced phosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177, whereas Akt phosphorylation was not affected. Coinciding with the inhibition of eNOS phosphorylation, endostatin completely blocked VEGF-induced EC migration. The NO-donor SNAP reversed the inhibitory effect of endostatin on EC migration. In addition, endostatin significantly inhibited VEGF-induced tube formation, whereas endostatin did not affect tube formation induced by NO. Finally, a non-dephosphorylatable constitutive active eNOS construct (S1177D), but not constitutive active Akt, abolished the inhibitory effect of endostatin on EC migration. Endostatin activated PP2A, which is known to directly dephosphorylate eNOS at Ser1177. Inhibition of PP2A prevented the inhibitory effect of endostatin. Thus, endostatin inhibits VEGF-induced EC migration and angiogenesis upstream of NO-synthesis via dephosphorylation of eNOS at Ser1177."

CLIC1 is widely distributed, being present in most tissues and cells that have been thus far examined. Immunofluorescence studies of CLIC1-transfected CHO1 cells indicate that it dominantly localizes to the nucleoplasm and nuclear membrane as well as the cytoplasm (1Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). However, it has also been visualized within small intracytoplasmic organelles, presumably lysosomes, endosomes, or secretory vesicles (1Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K.

In normal untransfected CHO cells, this translocation of CLIC1 to the plasma membrane occurs in a cell cycle-dependent manner (8Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R., Ru, Q.M. Warton K. Musgrove E. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 529: 541-551Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Native CLIC1 channel activity is routinely found only on the plasma membrane of cells in the act of dividing or cells that have just divided (7Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K.

Breit S.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 529: 541-551Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, when cells are transfected with CLIC1, this normal distribution pattern is disrupted, and CLIC1 Cl− conductance can be detected on the surface of all cells (7Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 8Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R., Ru, Q.M. Warton K. Musgrove E. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 529: 541-551Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This suggested a role for CLIC1 in the cell cycle. This view is further reinforced by the observations that CLIC1 blockers increase the percentage of CHO cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (8Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R., Ru, Q.M. Warton K. Musgrove E. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 529: 541-551Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). CLIC1 is quite unusual for an ion channel: it is small with only a single putative transmembrane region; it is largely a soluble intracellular protein with only small amounts of protein being found on membranes; and the structure of its soluble form does not resemble that of an ion channel. We have recently determined the high resolution, x-ray crystallographic structure of the soluble form of CLIC1 (9Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Maantizz M. Tonini R. Qiu M, R. Warton K. Bauskin A.R., Wu, W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol.

The protein is monomeric, structurally homologous to the GST superfamily and has a redox-active site resembling glutaredoxin. Integration of CLIC1 into a membrane is likely to require a major structural rearrangement, probably of the N-domain. Despite its unusual properties, we and others have previously provided strong data identifying it as an ion channel (1Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R.

To further investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of CLIC1 and to better understand its regulation, we describe a series of biochemical, biophysical, and electrophysiological studies performed using soluble, Escherichia coli-derived, recombinant CLIC1. We demonstrate that the isolated protein is able to form functional ion channels in an artificial lipid bilayer and that these channels have essentially identical electrophysiological characteristics to those seen in cell membranes. Channel formation involves at least two stages: the initial formation of a small conductance slow kinetics (SCSK) channel followed by the appearance of a high conductance fast kinetics (HCFK) channel, where the latter corresponds to the in vivochannel. Our results indicate that the HCFK channel probably results from the assembly of four SCSK conductances. Finally, we demonstrate that the association of CLIC1 with lipids and ion channel formation in bilayers are pH-dependent. A recombinant GST-CLIC1 fusion protein was expressed in E. coli using the pGEX-4T-1 vector system and purified as described previously (1Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion protein was immobilized on glutathioneS-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), where it was cleaved with biotin-labeled thrombin (Novagen). The thrombin was removed with a streptavidin-agarose affinity matrix, and CLIC1 was further purified by gel filtration on a Superdex G75 column (AmershamBiosciences), where it ran as a monomer. We performed patch clamp electrophysiology on inside-out patches of a CLIC1-expressing CHO cell line using standard methods as reported previously (7Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Single-channel recordings from lipid bilayers were obtained using the tip-dip method (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, patch clamp pipettes (Garner Glass 7052) were made using a P97 Sutter Instruments puller (Novato, CA), coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and fire-polished to a tip diameter of 1–1.5 μm and 5–7 megaohm resistance. The same solution was used both in the bath and in the pipette (140 mm KCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 6). We varied pH by addition of HCl or KOH. As soon as the pipette tip reached the bath solution, a phospholipid monolayer (phosphatidylcholine, Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Birmingham, AL) was spread on the surface. The electrode was repeatedly passed through the surface of the solution until the pipette resistance rose above 5 gigaohms. Purified recombinant CLIC1 protein (2 μg/ml) was then added to the bath. An Axopatch 1D amplifier and pClamp 7 (both from Axon Instruments, Novato, CA) were used to record and analyze single-channel currents. Current recordings were digitized at 5 kHz and filtered at 800 Hz. Purified,E. coli-derived recombinant CLIC1 was diluted 30-fold from stock solutions of about 5 mg/ml into 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer at either pH 7.0 or pH 6.0 and left at room temperature for 1 h prior to analysis. Far-UV CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Neslab RTE-111 temperature controller. CD data were collected over the wavelength range of 195–260 nm and with a resolution of 0.5 nm, a bandwidth of 1 nm, and a response time of 1 s. Final spectra were the sum of three scans accumulated at a speed of 20 nm·min−1 and were baseline-corrected. Fluorescence data were collected on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B luminescence spectrophotometer using 0.5-cm path length cells and 10-nm slit widths. The temperature was maintained at 25 °C using a Bio-Rad E4850 refrigerated recirculator water bath. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm (to specifically excite tryptophan fluorescence), and the emission was monitored from 320 to 380 nm. Liposome synthesis was based on a method from Hase et al. (13Hase C., Le Dain A.C. Martinac B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18329-18334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) modified as follows: phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) and cholesterol (Sigma) were dissolved in chloroform (Ajax Chemicals) at 100 and 10 mg/ml, respectively, and then combined to give a final 9:1 phosphatidylcholine:cholesterol ratio (18 mg of phosphatidylcholine + 2 mg of cholesterol). The lipid mixture was then coated in layers onto the sides of a glass test tube by rotating the tube under a stream of nitrogen. The lipids were dried overnight under vacuum and then resuspended by vortexing in 1 ml of HK buffer (140 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted with HCl). The lipid suspension was sonicated with glass beads in a Branson 3200 water bath sonicator until it became translucent (∼5–10 min), which is indicative of small, unilamellar liposomes having been formed. To measure association of CLIC1 with liposomes, 1.8 μg of purified recombinant CLIC1 was incubated with 150 μl of liposomes for periods between 10 min and 4 h. In experiments to check the effect of decreased pH, CLIC1 was combined with liposomes, and the pH was then adjusted with HCl. Liposomes were then purified on a discontinuous Ficoll density gradient as follows: liposomes were adjusted to 40% Ficoll and 1 ml of final volume with HK buffer and layered at the bottom of the gradient beneath 3 ml of 30% Ficoll and a 0% Ficoll buffer-only top layer that filled the remainder of the centrifuge tube. The gradient was centrifuged for 2 h at 20,000 rpm in an SW41 swing-bucket rotor at 5 °C. The unincorporated protein was collected from the 40% Ficoll fraction remaining at the bottom of the gradient, and the liposomes were collected from the 30% Ficoll/0% Ficoll interface. The collected liposome fractions were concentrated to a 50-μl volume using a RediVac, being careful not to dry the samples completely, and resuspended in 350 μl of SDS (3 g of SDS/100 ml of H2O). 30 μl of each sample was mixed with 10 μl of reducing 6× Laemmli sample buffer with 20% β-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and immediately electrophoresed on a 10% polyacrylamide gel. CLIC1 was detected by Western blotting as described previously (1Valenzuela S.M. Martin D.K. Por S.B. Robbins J.M. Warton K. Bootcov M.R. Schofield P.R. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12575-12582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Despite its small size and aqueous solubility, CLIC1 can be readily observed to form Cl− channels in tip-dip bilayer experiments. Fig. 1shows two examples of single-channel recordings obtained at two different pipette potentials (12Coronado R. Morrissette J. Sukhareva M. Vaughan D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1485-C1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Suarez-Isla B.A. Wan K. Lindstrom J. Montal M. Biochem. 1983; 22: 2319-2323Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Comparable results were obtained regardless of the potential used. Channel recordings always showed the same sequence of events. After bilayer formation on the electrode tip and addition of protein to the external solution, there was a variable time period of null events. Channel activity then started with a few long openings that, during the progression of the experiment, became more consistent in number. In 80% of successful experiments, multiple events turned into one or two larger size channels (as seen in Fig. 1, on the right of the traces) in which not only does the amplitude of each individual current step increase, but also the open and close kinetics turn into fast transitions (flickering). The analysis of such current recordings is very complicated because even superficial observations indicate that we are dealing with two different ionic conductances. The initial portion of a typical current trace shows the predominance of a small conductance channel with slow kinetics, which we call SCSK. These SCSK events show multiple current levels or steps. During a typical experiment, these SCSK events disappear, and they are replaced by a high conductance channel with fast kinetics, which we call HCFK. We have analyzed the SCSK pathway separately from the HCFK ionic pathway. Fig. 2 shows a detailed analysis of the SCSK channel seen in tip-dip experiments. Both inward and outward current recordings obtained at ±80 mV in the patch pipette are plotted on the left of the figure. In the center column, we show current amplitude histograms collected over three consecutive seconds of recording. The i/V relationships depicted on theright were plotted using the histogram peak with the highest current from each experiment. The conductances obtained by linear regression were 7.7 ± 0.95, 13.8 ± 1.1, 21.2 ± 1.6, and 30.5 ± 2.2 pS, respectively. For each individual current level, the mean open and close times were calculated. The average mean open time result of 250 ± 34 ms and mean close time result of 160 ± 42 ms were not statistically different between different current levels. Openings of SCSK channel are prominent in tip-dip experiments but can also be found in current recordings from the plasma membranes of CHO cells that have been transfected to express CLIC1 (called CHO-CLIC1). In Fig. 3, we show several examples of single-channel recordings in equimolar 140 mm KCl obtained in tip-dip configuration (left) and in inside-out patches from CHO-CLIC1 (right). In inside-out current traces, smaller current levels are only occasionally evident as part of the single-channel kinetics. Observing native channels, the SCSK type of openings (as judged by their amplitude) show both fast and slow kinetics. This is probably due to the fact that channel subunits are assembled to form a HCFK channel, and current substates are sporadic events occurring randomly. In tip-dip experiments, SCSK openings are produced by proteins that have not yet assembled into a higher order HCFK channel. The recordings presented on the right side of Fig. 3 were chosen from a 22-min continuous recording. By contrast, tip-dip channel current traces clearly showed many small current transitions and (rarely) simultaneous multiple openings or closings in the initial portion of an experiment. However, as soon as the activity of the HCFK channel appears in the tip-dip experiment, SCSK current openings became sporadic, and their frequency of appearance was then comparable with those in inside-out patch experiments. We note that the conductance of the SCSK channel is 30.5 pS when four current levels are present. This is almost identical to the conductance of the HCFK channel reported previously (9Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Maantizz M. Tonini R. Qiu M, R. Warton K. Bauskin A.R., Wu, W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) in both the tip-dip experiments (31.2 ± 1.5 pS) and the recordings of CLIC1 from CHO-transfected cells (29.6 ± 1.9 pS). In light of these results, we have reason to believe that in the tip-dip experiments, the activity of HCFK channel represents the main conductive state of the fully reconstituted CLIC1 channel, and the SCSK pathway is due to substates of the same channel visible only during the channel assembly process. To explore the main channel characteristics, we will then consider only the openings of HCFK channels. Accordingly, Fig. 4 shows a series of shorter single-channel current recordings obtained in equimolar 140 mm KCl at different patch-pipette potentials. They produced the current/voltages relationship shown on the right of the Fig. 4. The mean single-channel conductance for the HCFK was 31 ± 1.8 pS (n = 5). It is critical to our understanding of CLIC1 to determine whether its electrophysiological characteristics in lipid bilayers are similar or identical to those in cell membranes. Analysis of the CLIC1 HCFK pathway in lipid bilayers indicates a conductance value of 30.5 pS. In our recent experiments (9Harrop S.J. DeMaere M.Z. Fairlie W.D. Reztsova T. Valenzuela S.M. Maantizz M. Tonini R. Qiu M, R. Warton K. Bauskin A.R., Wu, W.M. Pankhurst S. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Curmi P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44993-45000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), both tip-dip HCFK pathway and inside-out recordings of CLIC1 from CHO-transfected cells (CHO-CLIC1) showed conductances of 31.2 ± 1.5 pS and 29.6 ± 1.9 pS, respectively. This indicates that CLIC1 has essentially identical conductance characteristics on the cell membrane as in lipid bilayers. To further compare the characteristics of this ion channel in tip-dip bilayer and in CHO-CLIC1 membranes, we analyzed the kinetic characteristics of HCFK single-channel recordings in the two preparations. Fig. 5 depicts open probability (P o) and open- and closed-time histograms (the example is at V p = −40 mV) for HCFK single channels in both experimental configurations.P o was very similar in the two models (0.478 ± 0.035 for inside-out and 0.532 ± 0.026 for tip-dip) and remained constant over a wide range of membrane potentials (Fig. 5, left). From the histograms on the rightof Fig. 5, we calculated average open (τopen) and closed (τclosed) times of the channel. These properties are virtually identical regardless of whether CLIC1 is functionally expressed in artificial bilayers or when CLIC1 is transfected in CHO cells. In the experiments shown in Fig.6 a, we applied a ±100-mV voltage ramp to artificial bilayers in which only one HCFK CLIC1 channel was active. Using this voltage ramp protocol, a slight rectification of the channel at high potentials is sometimes evident (11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the same voltage protocol, we compared the Cl−dependence of CLIC1 conductance in the inside-out configuration obtained from CHO-CLIC1 (b), which we have reported previously (7Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with that produced using the recombinant protein in lipid bilayers (c). The channel conductance in artificial membranes drops to 13 ± 2.3 pS (n = 5) in 20 mm external Cl− with a reversal potential of −60 mV. This is in good agreement with that which we have reported for CHO-CLIC1 (7Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Also clearly evident is the shift in current reversal potential in Fig. 6, b and c, as compared with Fig. 6 a. Channel openings are seen in Fig. 6, band c, at the 0 mV holding potential before and after the ramp. By contrast, in Fig. 6 a, in equimolar Cl−conditions, no ionic current is flowing during these recording segments. The outward channel openings in Fig. 6, b andc, demonstrate a negative shift of the current reversal potential. The CLIC1 ion channel, when expressed in CHO cells, is inhibited by IAA94 and A9C but not DIDS (7Tonini R. Ferroni A. Valenzuela S.M. Warton K. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. Mazzanti M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We wanted to determine whether CLIC1 in artificial bilayers exhibited the same characteristics. We found that CLIC1 channels in bilayers have an identical inhibitor profile. Since the blocking action of A9C is irreversible, we confined subsequent studies to the use of IAA94. Fig. 7 (top) shows the effect of increasing IAA94 concentration during perfusion of a tip-dip patch containing only one functional HCFK Cl− channel clamped at −60 mV. Increasing the concentration from 1 to 50 μmresults in a dose-dependent decrease in the channel open probability. In the dose/response graph (Fig. 7, bottom), the normalized channel open probability, P o, is plotted against the IAA94 concentration. This indicates a maximum effect at concentrations between 50 and 100 μm with a Hill coefficient of 1.4 and an IC50 of 25 μm(n = 4). All these data are in good agreement with our own data from outside-out experiments performed on CHO cells (8Valenzuela S.M. Mazzanti M. Tonini R., Ru, Q.M. Warton K. Musgrove E. Campbell T.J. Breit S.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2001; 529: 541-551Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and with the bilayer experiments reported by Tulk et al.(11Tulk B.M. Schlesinger P.H. Kapadia S.A. Edwards J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26986-26993Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a number of experiments (for example, Fig.8), many SCSK current sublevels were observed without the formation of the HCFK channel. We found that blockade of these higher order SCSK substates required concentrations of IAA94 from 5 to 10 times higher than those for the unitary HCFK conductance (above 300 μm). To determine whether ion channel formation in artificial membranes was pH-dependent, we added recombinant CLIC1 to the bath solution at various pH levels and then monitored the time to detect the first event. In Fig.9, we show three examples of this procedure with the pipette potential held at −50 mV. In all three cases, the initial ion channel activity appears as SCSK channels, as described previously in the legend for Fig. 1. However, as the pH decreases, there is a decrement of the time to observe the first opening. In addition, the probability of observing a 30-pS channel (HCFK) was higher at low pH. In Fig.10, we have plotted both the average time before the appearance of the first conductance (A), usually an SCSK channel, and the probability of forming a complete HCFK channel (B). The plot on the left of Fig. 10clearly suggests the existence of a threshold between pH 6 and 6.5 in which the channel changes drastically its ability to insert into the artificial membrane. The time needed to observe a functional SCSK ion channel is almost tripled as the pH of the bath solution increased from pH range 5–6 to range 6.5–7. Probably as a consequence, the histogram plot on the right shows that the formation of HCFK channels has a higher probability at low pH. However, all attempts to determine whether pH is also involved in the transition of single functional SCSK units to form a HCFK channel in the membrane have failed. A simple explanation of our observations could be that low pH increases the probability of protein insertion into the lipid membrane, increasing the concentration of CLIC1 in the bilayer. This, in turn, favors the aggregation of channel SCSK subunits into a HCFK channel. We have no data at the moment to show a direct influence of the change in the pH of the solution on multimer formation in the membrane.Figure 10CLIC1 single-channel activityversus pH. As shown in A, the time of the first functional insertion in the lipid bilayer increases markedly as the solution pH goes from a range of 5–5.5 to one of 6.5–7.B, probability of CLIC1 protein forming a 30-pS high current fast kinetics HCFK channel. The histogram shows a higher occurrence of channel aggregates at lower pH. However, it is impossible to distinguish whether the pH is responsible for this phenomenon or whether the higher number of sublevels observed at low pH contributes by itself to increase the probability of 30-pS channel formation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To observe the interaction of CLIC1 with artificial lipid bilayers, purified recombinant CLIC1 was incubated with liposomes for between 10 min and 4 h.

Elevation of glucose leads to increases in cytosolic [Ca2+] i and biphasic release of insulin from both a readily releasable and a storage pool of β-granules. The effect of elevated [Ca2+] i on phosphorylation of isolated β-granule membrane proteins was evaluated, and the phosphorylation of four proteins was found to be altered by [Ca2+] i . One (a 18/20-kDa doublet) was a Ca2+-dependent increase in phosphorylation, and, surprisingly, three others (138, 42, and 36 kDa) were Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylations. The 138-kDa β-granule phosphoprotein was found to be kinesin heavy chain (KHC). At low levels of [Ca2+] i KHC was phosphorylated by casein kinase 2, but KHC was rapidly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2B β (PP2Bβ) as [Ca2+] i increased. Inhibitors of PP2B specifically reduced the second, microtubule-dependent, phase of insulin secretion, suggesting that dephosphorylation of KHC was required for transport of β-granules from the storage pool to replenish the readily releasable pool of β-granules. This is distinct from synaptic vesicle exocytosis, because neurotransmitter release from synaptosomes did not require a Ca2+-dependent KHC dephosphorylation. These results suggest a novel mechanism for regulating KHC function and β-granule transport in β-cells that is mediated by casein kinase 2 and PP2B.

It has been presumed that increased cytosolic [Ca2+] i in β-cells is the major secondary signal that stimulates distal exocytotic secretory events (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). However, the means by which increased cytosolic [Ca2+] i induces β-granule transport from an intracellular storage pool to be docked at a pre-exocytotic site against the plasma membrane and then to promote β-granule membrane/plasma membrane fusion for the final exocytotic event are poorly understood. Moreover, regulatory factors besides cytosolic [Ca2+] i , as well as certain facilitating proteins, are necessary to instigate glucose-regulated insulin exocytosis (2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).Recently, there have been insights into the mechanism of insulin exocytosis, largely guided by advances in understanding mechanisms of synaptic vesicle exocytosis (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar, 4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, there is currently no convincing indication as to how secondary coupling signals such as [Ca2+] i , influenced by changes in nutrient metabolism, communicate with the β-cell's exocytotic apparatus to promote insulin release. Hence, questions remain as to how insulin exocytosis is actually controlled. This is a complex issue because there are several stages to insulin exocytosis, all of which contain potential regulatory sites to control insulin release (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This study focuses on the mechanism by which transport of β-granules from an intracellular storage pool to a readily releasable pool of granules at the β-cell plasma membrane might be controlled.Previous work suggested that β-granules are transported along microtubules, likely driven by ATP-dependent motors such as kinesin (5Balczon R. Overstreet K.A. Zinkowski R.P. Haynes A. Appel M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many members of the kinesin superfamily are found in mammalian cells (7Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 50-58Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Brady S.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), including conventional kinesin, a heterotetramer consisting of two kinesin heavy chains (KHC)1 and two light chains (KLC). The head domain contains the ATPase and microtubule binding activity, whereas the tail portion of kinesin contains vesicle (or cargo) binding domains (8Brady S.T.

Regulation of conventional kinesin activity is likely to depend on cell type and isoforms of kinesin present, but may be mediated by interaction between subunits (10Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Mol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that kinesin is a phosphoproteinin vivo suggests that phosphorylation of specific residues on kinesin by specific kinases is likely to be important for regulating some aspects of kinesin function, just as the predominant regulation of myosins and dyneins is through phosphorylation (23King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 24Barylko B. Binns D.D. Albanesi J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The key will be to identify specific kinases and phosphatases important for regulation of a given kinesin-dependent process in vivo.Several protein kinases have been implicated in stimulus-coupling mechanisms for glucose-induced insulin release (25Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55S: 54-65Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In particular, activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase-2 correlates with glucose-induced insulin exocytosis, most likely in response to nutrient-induced rises in β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+] i (26Easom R.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, certain protein kinase C isoforms appear to be involved in nutrient-regulated insulin exocytosis, presumably as a result of nutrient-induced rises in both cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA and [Ca2+] i (2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Deeney J.T. Cunningham B.A. Chheda S. Bokvist K. Juntti-Berggren L. Lam K. Korchak H.M. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18154-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, protein kinase A is important for the potentiation of nutrient-induced insulin release by incretins such as glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (28Fehmann H.-C. Göke R. Göke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To counterbalance protein kinase activities, phosphoprotein phosphatases must also play a role in the nutrient-mediated regulation of insulin release in β-cells, even though this has not been extensively investigated. Regardless, there is little information about the appropriate protein kinase/phosphatase substrates relevant to the insulin exocytosis mechanism, nor is there much known about how the phosphorylation state of such protein substrates could control insulin release.In this study, we present evidence that kinesin heavy chains in β-granules are phosphorylated under basal condition in β-cells by casein kinase-2 (CK2), and dephosphorylated by phosphoprotein-2B (PP2B, also known as calcineurin) in a Ca2+-dependent manner under conditions that stimulate insulin secretion. This represents a suitable “exocytotic phosphoprotein substrate” downstream of a rise in [Ca2+] i not previously documented in β-cells. This study highlights a novel regulatory aspect of the insulin exocytotic mechanism, whereby activation of Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation of kinesin controls sustained β-granule transport.DISCUSSIONKinesin is known to be present in β-cells (5Balczon R. Overstreet K.A. Zinkowski R.P. Haynes A. Appel M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and suppression of kinesin expression by antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion (6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kinesin plays a role in attaching granules to microtubulin and as an ATP-dependent motor driving β-granules along microtubules toward the plasma membrane (6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it should be considered that β-granule transport is tightly controlled in the β-cell to appropriately replenish the ready releasable pool of β-granules at the plasma membrane lost by glucose-induced exocytosis (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As such, it is probable that kinesin is regulated in the β-cell under the influence of glucose. However, it is unclear how kinesin activity is controlled in β-cells. Kinesin regulation, in part, appears to be characteristic of the cell type and/or kinesin isoform present, and possibly by its phosphorylation state and/or associated proteins (10–22). In this study, immunoblot analysis could not detect KLC associated with the KHC on β-granules (data not shown), and as such it was thought that kinesin activity was more likely regulated by KHC phosphorylation.Although phosphorylation of β-granule proteins was demonstrated previously and proposed to play a role in insulin secretion (50Brocklehurst K.W. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 533-539Crossref Google Scholar, 51Penn E.J. Brocklehurst K.W. Sopwith A.M. Hales C.N. Hutton J.C. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the identity of relevant phosphoprotein substrates is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intrinsic Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of β-granule proteins had not been examined. Anin vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the phosphorylation state of at least four β-granule proteins was regulated in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, increased [Ca2+] caused dephosphorylation of three of these proteins, suggesting an important role for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PP2B (also known as calcineurin) in control of insulin exocytosis. The identity of the p18/p20, p36, and p42 β-granule phosphoproteins remains unknown, but immunological and pharmacological data identified p138 as KHC. Further analysis indicated that β-granule KHC was phosphorylated by CK2 and confirmed it to dephosphorylated in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner by PP2Bβ. Moreover, all three components (CK2, PP2B β-isoform, and KHC) were enriched in β-granule fractions. Calmodulin was previously shown to be associated with β-granules in pancreatic β-cells (52Kajio H. Olszewski S. Rosner P. Donelan M. Geoghegan K. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as required for Ca2+-dependent PP2B activation (53Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Thus, relevant kinase and phosphatase activities were present in the same β-cell intracellular compartment as their KHC substrate. Significantly, this effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KHC was not seen in synaptosomes, suggesting that this may be a mechanism specific to secretory cells with large microtubule-associated storage pools.Glucose is the most physiologically relevant nutrient controlling insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (1Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Elevated extracellular glucose levels result in increased glucose metabolism in β-cells, leading to a rise in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio that then causes closure of KATP channels, depolarization, then opening of voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+-channels and a subsequent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] i (1Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rise in [Ca2+] i is an important contributing factor to triggering both insulin release (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar) and β-granule transport (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is therefore proposed that at basal glucose concentrations, cytosolic [Ca2+] i is relatively low, PP2B will be comparatively inactive, and KHC phosphorylation by constitutively active CK2 is high. As a consequence, kinesin activity and β-granule transport would be low. In contrast, cytosolic [Ca2+] i is markedly increased at stimulatory glucose concentrations (2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar), so that PP2B would be activated and β-granule KHC dephosphorylated. As a result, kinesin ATP-dependent motor activity is activated and β-granule transport along microtubules triggered (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such a scenario is supported by our observations that the KHC phosphorylation state in pancreatic β-cells is inversely proportional to glucose-induced stimulation of insulin secretion (Figs. 8 and 10) and that only the second phase of the biphasic insulin secretory response to a stimulatory glucose concentration was significantly affected.The first phase of release represents the ready releasable pool of β-granules already docked at the β-cell plasma membrane and does not require additional movement along microtubules. In contrast, the second phase requires mobilization of β-granules from a storage pool to replenish the readily releasable pool of β-granules in addition to β-granule docking and the final stages of stimulated exocytosis (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Disruption of microtubules in islet β-cells preferentially inhibits this second phase of insulin release, indicating that microtubules are required for β-granule transport during this stage (54Montague W. Howell S.L. Green I.C. Biochem. J. 1975; 148: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 55Boyd A.E. Bolton W.E. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, specific inhibition of PP2B in pancreatic islet β-cells by AdV-CAIN or cypermethrin significantly inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion (Figs. 9 and 10). In perifusion studies it was found that the second phase, but not the first phase, of glucose-induced insulin secretion was inhibited, consistent with a regulatory role for PP2B in control of β-granule transport. This implies that dephosphorylation of KHC triggers kinesin-based transport of β-granules along microtubules. Blocking KHC dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP2B prevents mobilization of β-granules and reduces the total amount of insulin available for release. Interestingly, prolonged treatment with cyclosporin A or FK506 (which are also inhibitors of PP2B (Ref. 53Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar)) was found to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion (56Herold K.C. Nagamatsu S. Buse J.B. Kulsakdinun P. Steiner D.F. Transplantation. 1993; 55: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 57Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Use of cyclosporin A/FK506 as an immunosuppressant in islet transplantation therapy for diabetes was unsuccessful, because it is detrimental for β-cell function and insulin secretion (58Kenyon N.S. Ranuncoli A. Masetti M. Chatzipetrou M. Ricordi C. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This adverse effect of cyclosporin A/FK506 on insulin release is likely the result of PP2B inhibition that in turn prevents kinesin-mediated β-granule transport and lowers the β-granule pool docked at the plasma membrane available for exocytosis. However, it should be noted that inhibition of PP2B does not completely block glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets, indicating that this is not the only Ca2+-dependent component in insulin secretion. Other Ca2+-regulated β-granule proteins are likely to play a role in Ca2+-induced exocytosis from β-cells, although their identity and precise functions have yet to be defined (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).In summary, the data in this study imply that KHC was not actively transporting β-granules in β-cells when phosphorylated by CK2 in a basal state. However, a nutrient-induced increase in β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+] i leads to Ca2+/calmodulin-induced activation of PP2B, which dephosphorylates KHC, activating kinesin motor activity and enhancing microtubule-based β-granule transport This PP2Bβ-mediated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent dephosphorylation of KHC represents a first insight into a connection between generation of key secondary coupling signal (i.e. a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] i ) and a component of the mechanism of insulin exocytosis (i.e.increased kinesin/microtubule based β-granule motility) (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, a previously unsuspected role for PP2B/calcineurin is revealed in control of insulin secretion. Early events in glucose-induced insulin release involve generation of a series of signals derived from glucose metabolism that alter ion-channel fluxes and lead to a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] i (1Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It has been presumed that increased cytosolic [Ca2+] i in β-cells is the major secondary signal that stimulates distal exocytotic secretory events (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar). However, the means by which increased cytosolic [Ca2+] i induces β-granule transport from an intracellular storage pool to be docked at a pre-exocytotic site against the plasma membrane and then to promote β-granule membrane/plasma membrane fusion for the final exocytotic event are poorly understood. Moreover, regulatory factors besides cytosolic [Ca2+] i , as well as certain facilitating proteins, are necessary to instigate glucose-regulated insulin exocytosis (2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, there have been insights into the mechanism of insulin exocytosis, largely guided by advances in understanding mechanisms of synaptic vesicle exocytosis (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar, 4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, there is currently no convincing indication as to how secondary coupling signals such as [Ca2+] i , influenced by changes in nutrient metabolism, communicate with the β-cell's exocytotic apparatus to promote insulin release. Hence, questions remain as to how insulin exocytosis is actually controlled. This is a complex issue because there are several stages to insulin exocytosis, all of which contain potential regulatory sites to control insulin release (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This study focuses on the mechanism by which transport of β-granules from an intracellular storage pool to a readily releasable pool of granules at the β-cell plasma membrane might be controlled. Previous work suggested that β-granules are transported along microtubules, likely driven by ATP-dependent motors such as kinesin (5Balczon R. Overstreet K.A. Zinkowski R.P. Haynes A. Appel M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Many members of the kinesin superfamily are found in mammalian cells (7Woehlke G. Schliwa M. Nat. Rev. 2000; 1: 50-58Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Brady S.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), including conventional kinesin, a heterotetramer consisting of two kinesin heavy chains (KHC)1 and two light chains (KLC). The head domain contains the ATPase and microtubule binding activity, whereas the tail portion of kinesin contains vesicle (or cargo) binding domains (8Brady S.T. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 9Hirokawa N. Science. 1998; 279: 519-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). Regulation of conventional kinesin activity is likely to depend on cell type and isoforms of kinesin present, but may be mediated by interaction between subunits (10Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Mol.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but the functional consequences of this phosphorylation are uncertain. Effects on vesicle binding, ATPase activity, and microtubule binding have been reported (10Stenoien D.L. Brady S.T. Mol. Biol.

Neurochem. 1993; 60: 2265-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar,18Lee K.D. Hollenbeck P.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 281-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that kinesin is a phosphoproteinin vivo suggests that phosphorylation of specific residues on kinesin by specific kinases is likely to be important for regulating some aspects of kinesin function, just as the predominant regulation of myosins and dyneins is through phosphorylation (23King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 24Barylko B. Binns D.D. Albanesi J.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The key will be to identify specific kinases and phosphatases important for regulation of a given kinesin-dependent process in vivo. Several protein kinases have been implicated in stimulus-coupling mechanisms for glucose-induced insulin release (25Ashcroft F.M. Proks P. Smith P.A. Ammala C. Bokvist K. Rorsman P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55S: 54-65Crossref Scopus (243) Google Scholar). In particular, activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase-2 correlates with glucose-induced insulin exocytosis, most likely in response to nutrient-induced rises in β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+] i (26Easom R.A. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In addition, certain protein kinase C isoforms appear to be involved in nutrient-regulated insulin exocytosis, presumably as a result of nutrient-induced rises in both cytosolic long chain acyl-CoA and [Ca2+] i (2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Deeney J.T. Cunningham B.A. Chheda S. Bokvist K. Juntti-Berggren L. Lam K. Korchak H.M. Corkey B.E. Berggren P.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18154-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, protein kinase A is important for the potentiation of nutrient-induced insulin release by incretins such as glucagon-like peptide 1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (28Fehmann H.-C. Göke R. Göke B. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 390-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). To counterbalance protein kinase activities, phosphoprotein phosphatases must also play a role in the nutrient-mediated regulation of insulin release in β-cells, even though this has not been extensively investigated. Regardless, there is little information about the appropriate protein kinase/phosphatase substrates relevant to the insulin exocytosis mechanism, nor is there much known about how the phosphorylation state of such protein substrates could control insulin release. In this study, we present evidence that kinesin heavy chains in β-granules are phosphorylated under basal condition in β-cells by casein kinase-2 (CK2), and dephosphorylated by phosphoprotein-2B (PP2B, also known as calcineurin) in a Ca2+-dependent manner under conditions that stimulate insulin secretion. This represents a suitable “exocytotic phosphoprotein substrate” downstream of a rise in [Ca2+] i not previously documented in β-cells. This study highlights a novel regulatory aspect of the insulin exocytotic mechanism, whereby activation of Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation of kinesin controls sustained β-granule transport. DISCUSSIONKinesin is known to be present in β-cells (5Balczon R. Overstreet K.A. Zinkowski R.P. Haynes A. Appel M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and suppression of kinesin expression by antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion (6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kinesin plays a role in attaching granules to microtubulin and as an ATP-dependent motor driving β-granules along microtubules toward the plasma membrane (6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it should be considered that β-granule transport is tightly controlled in the β-cell to appropriately replenish the ready releasable pool of β-granules at the plasma membrane lost by glucose-induced exocytosis (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As such, it is probable that kinesin is regulated in the β-cell under the influence of glucose. However, it is unclear how kinesin activity is controlled in β-cells. Kinesin regulation, in part, appears to be characteristic of the cell type and/or kinesin isoform present, and possibly by its phosphorylation state and/or associated proteins (10–22). In this study, immunoblot analysis could not detect KLC associated with the KHC on β-granules (data not shown), and as such it was thought that kinesin activity was more likely regulated by KHC phosphorylation.Although phosphorylation of β-granule proteins was demonstrated previously and proposed to play a role in insulin secretion (50Brocklehurst K.W. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 533-539Crossref Google Scholar, 51Penn E.J. Brocklehurst K.W. Sopwith A.M. Hales C.N. Hutton J.C. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the identity of relevant phosphoprotein substrates is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intrinsic Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of β-granule proteins had not been examined. Anin vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the phosphorylation state of at least four β-granule proteins was regulated in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, increased [Ca2+] caused dephosphorylation of three of these proteins, suggesting an important role for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PP2B (also known as calcineurin) in control of insulin exocytosis. The identity of the p18/p20, p36, and p42 β-granule phosphoproteins remains unknown, but immunological and pharmacological data identified p138 as KHC. Further analysis indicated that β-granule KHC was phosphorylated by CK2 and confirmed it to dephosphorylated in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner by PP2Bβ. Moreover, all three components (CK2, PP2B β-isoform, and KHC) were enriched in β-granule fractions. Calmodulin was previously shown to be associated with β-granules in pancreatic β-cells (52Kajio H. Olszewski S. Rosner P. Donelan M. Geoghegan K. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as required for Ca2+-dependent PP2B activation (53Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Thus, relevant kinase and phosphatase activities were present in the same β-cell intracellular compartment as their KHC substrate. Significantly, this effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KHC was not seen in synaptosomes, suggesting that this may be a mechanism specific to secretory cells with large microtubule-associated storage pools.Glucose is the most physiologically relevant nutrient controlling insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (1Prentki M.

Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Elevated extracellular glucose levels result in increased glucose metabolism in β-cells, leading to a rise in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio that then causes closure of KATP channels, depolarization, then opening of voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+-channels and a subsequent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] i (1Prentki M.

Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rise in [Ca2+] i is an important contributing factor to triggering both insulin release (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar) and β-granule transport (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar).

As a result, kinesin ATP-dependent motor activity is activated and β-granule transport along microtubules triggered (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev.

However, a nutrient-induced increase in β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+] i leads to Ca2+/calmodulin-induced activation of PP2B, which dephosphorylates KHC, activating kinesin motor activity and enhancing microtubule-based β-granule transport This PP2Bβ-mediated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent dephosphorylation of KHC represents a first insight into a connection between generation of key secondary coupling signal (i.e. a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] i ) and a component of the mechanism of insulin exocytosis (i.e.increased kinesin/microtubule based β-granule motility) (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, a previously unsuspected role for PP2B/calcineurin is revealed in control of insulin secretion. Kinesin is known to be present in β-cells (5Balczon R. Overstreet K.A. Zinkowski R.P. Haynes A. Appel M. Endocrinology. 1992; 131: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and suppression of kinesin expression by antisense oligonucleotide treatment reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion (6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Kinesin plays a role in attaching granules to microtubulin and as an ATP-dependent motor driving β-granules along microtubules toward the plasma membrane (6Meng Y.X. Wilson G.W. Avery M.C. Varden C.H. Balczon R. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1979-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, it should be considered that β-granule transport is tightly controlled in the β-cell to appropriately replenish the ready releasable pool of β-granules at the plasma membrane lost by glucose-induced exocytosis (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As such, it is probable that kinesin is regulated in the β-cell under the influence of glucose. However, it is unclear how kinesin activity is controlled in β-cells. Kinesin regulation, in part, appears to be characteristic of the cell type and/or kinesin isoform present, and possibly by its phosphorylation state and/or associated proteins (10–22). In this study, immunoblot analysis could not detect KLC associated with the KHC on β-granules (data not shown), and as such it was thought that kinesin activity was more likely regulated by KHC phosphorylation. Although phosphorylation of β-granule proteins was demonstrated previously and proposed to play a role in insulin secretion (50Brocklehurst K.W. Hutton J.C. Biochem. J. 1983; 216: 533-539Crossref Google Scholar, 51Penn E.J. Brocklehurst K.W. Sopwith A.M. Hales C.N. Hutton J.C. FEBS Lett. 1982; 139: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), the identity of relevant phosphoprotein substrates is largely unknown. Furthermore, the intrinsic Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation of β-granule proteins had not been examined. Anin vitro phosphorylation assay revealed that the phosphorylation state of at least four β-granule proteins was regulated in a Ca2+-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, increased [Ca2+] caused dephosphorylation of three of these proteins, suggesting an important role for the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent PP2B (also known as calcineurin) in control of insulin exocytosis. The identity of the p18/p20, p36, and p42 β-granule phosphoproteins remains unknown, but immunological and pharmacological data identified p138 as KHC. Further analysis indicated that β-granule KHC was phosphorylated by CK2 and confirmed it to dephosphorylated in a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent manner by PP2Bβ. Moreover, all three components (CK2, PP2B β-isoform, and KHC) were enriched in β-granule fractions. Calmodulin was previously shown to be associated with β-granules in pancreatic β-cells (52Kajio H. Olszewski S. Rosner P. Donelan M. Geoghegan K. Rhodes C.J. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 2029-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as required for Ca2+-dependent PP2B activation (53Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar). Thus, relevant kinase and phosphatase activities were present in the same β-cell intracellular compartment as their KHC substrate. Significantly, this effect of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of KHC was not seen in synaptosomes, suggesting that this may be a mechanism specific to secretory cells with large microtubule-associated storage pools. Glucose is the most physiologically relevant nutrient controlling insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells (1Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Elevated extracellular glucose levels result in increased glucose metabolism in β-cells, leading to a rise in the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio that then causes closure of KATP channels, depolarization, then opening of voltage-sensitive L-type Ca2+-channels and a subsequent increase in cytosolic [Ca2+] i (1Prentki M. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 134: 272-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The rise in [Ca2+] i is an important contributing factor to triggering both insulin release (3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar) and β-granule transport (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is therefore proposed that at basal glucose concentrations, cytosolic [Ca2+] i is relatively low, PP2B will be comparatively inactive, and KHC phosphorylation by constitutively active CK2 is high. As a consequence, kinesin activity and β-granule transport would be low. In contrast, cytosolic [Ca2+] i is markedly increased at stimulatory glucose concentrations (2Deeney J.T. Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 3Wollheim C.B. Lang J. Regazzi R. Diabetes Rev. 1996; 4: 276-297Google Scholar), so that PP2B would be activated and β-granule KHC dephosphorylated. As a result, kinesin ATP-dependent motor activity is activated and β-granule transport along microtubules triggered (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Such a scenario is supported by our observations that the KHC phosphorylation state in pancreatic β-cells is inversely proportional to glucose-induced stimulation of insulin secretion (Figs. 8 and 10) and that only the second phase of the biphasic insulin secretory response to a stimulatory glucose concentration was significantly affected. The first phase of release represents the ready releasable pool of β-granules already docked at the β-cell plasma membrane and does not require additional movement along microtubules. In contrast, the second phase requires mobilization of β-granules from a storage pool to replenish the readily releasable pool of β-granules in addition to β-granule docking and the final stages of stimulated exocytosis (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Disruption of microtubules in islet β-cells preferentially inhibits this second phase of insulin release, indicating that microtubules are required for β-granule transport during this stage (54Montague W. Howell S.L. Green I.C. Biochem. J. 1975; 148: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 55Boyd A.E. Bolton W.E. Brinkley B.R. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 92: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, specific inhibition of PP2B in pancreatic islet β-cells by AdV-CAIN or cypermethrin significantly inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion (Figs. 9 and 10). In perifusion studies it was found that the second phase, but not the first phase, of glucose-induced insulin secretion was inhibited, consistent with a regulatory role for PP2B in control of β-granule transport. This implies that dephosphorylation of KHC triggers kinesin-based transport of β-granules along microtubules. Blocking KHC dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP2B prevents mobilization of β-granules and reduces the total amount of insulin available for release. Interestingly, prolonged treatment with cyclosporin A or FK506 (which are also inhibitors of PP2B (Ref. 53Rusnak F. Mertz P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1483-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar)) was found to inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion (56Herold K.C. Nagamatsu S. Buse J.B. Kulsakdinun P. Steiner D.F. Transplantation. 1993; 55: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 57Robertson R.P. Diabetes. 1986; 35: 1016-1019Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Use of cyclosporin A/FK506 as an immunosuppressant in islet transplantation therapy for diabetes was unsuccessful, because it is detrimental for β-cell function and insulin secretion (58Kenyon N.S. Ranuncoli A. Masetti M. Chatzipetrou M. Ricordi C. Diabetes Metab. Rev. 1998; 14: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This adverse effect of cyclosporin A/FK506 on insulin release is likely the result of PP2B inhibition that in turn prevents kinesin-mediated β-granule transport and lowers the β-granule pool docked at the plasma membrane available for exocytosis. However, it should be noted that inhibition of PP2B does not completely block glucose-induced insulin secretion from isolated islets, indicating that this is not the only Ca2+-dependent component in insulin secretion. Other Ca2+-regulated β-granule proteins are likely to play a role in Ca2+-induced exocytosis from β-cells, although their identity and precise functions have yet to be defined (4Easom R.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In summary, the data in this study imply that KHC was not actively transporting β-granules in β-cells when phosphorylated by CK2 in a basal state. However, a nutrient-induced increase in β-cell cytosolic [Ca2+] i leads to Ca2+/calmodulin-induced activation of PP2B, which dephosphorylates KHC, activating kinesin motor activity and enhancing microtubule-based β-granule transport This PP2Bβ-mediated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent dephosphorylation of KHC represents a first insight into a connection between generation of key secondary coupling signal (i.e. a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+] i ) and a component of the mechanism of insulin exocytosis (i.e.increased kinesin/microtubule based β-granule motility) (4Easom R.A.

https://openalex.org/W2142663085,"Oxidative stress can impair proteasome function, both of which are features of neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of proteasome function leads to protein accumulation and cell death. We discovered recently the formation of highly reactive g-ketoaldehydes, isoketals (IsoKs), and neuroketals (NeuroKs) as products of the isoprostane and neuroprostane pathways of free radical-induced lipid peroxidation that are analogous to cyclooxygenase-derived levuglandins (LGs). Because aldehydes that are much less reactive than IsoKs have been shown to inhibit proteasome function, we explored the ability of the proteasome to degrade IsoK-adducted proteins/peptides and the effect of IsoK and IsoK-adducted proteins/peptides on proteasome function. Adduction of IsoK to model proteasome substrates significantly reduced their rate of degradation by the 20S proteasome. The ability of IsoK to inhibit proteasome function directly was observed only at very high concentrations. However, at much lower concentrations, an IsoK-adducted protein (ovalbumin) and peptide (Ab1-40) significantly inhibited chymotrypsin-like activity of the 20S proteasome. Moreover, incubation of IsoK with P19 neuroglial cultures dose-dependently inhibited proteasome activity (IC50 = 330 nM) and induced cell death (LC50 = 670 nM). These findings suggest that IsoKs/NeuroKs/LGs can inhibit proteasome activity and, if overproduced, may have relevance to the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1983947718,"Globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease) is characterized by the accumulation of a toxic metabolite, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), which is a substrate for the deficient enzyme (galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase). This study underscores the possible role of psychosine in the effect of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) -derived NO in the pathophysiology of this demyelinating disease. For the first time, we provide evidence of the expression of iNOS in CNS of Krabbe patient and show that the iNOS-expressing cells in the CNS were astrocytes. Psychosine potentiated the LPS-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) in primary rat astrocytes and regulated the cytokine-mediated production of NO in C6 glioma and primary rat astrocyte. Psychosine induced cytokine-mediated nuclear translocation of AP-1 and C/EBP by potentiating the expression of Fra-1 and C/EBP-delta proteins. This suggests that psychosine maintained or sustained the cytokine-primed expression of iNOS by further potentiating the nuclear translocation of AP-1 and C/EBP without modulating the cytokine-mediated transcription activity of NF-kappaB. This study hypothesizes that accumulated psychosine leads to production of cytokines and iNOS expression. The ensuing excessive production of NO and ONOO- may play a role in pathogenesis of Krabbe disease."
https://openalex.org/W2148616262,"The orexigenic neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) plays a central role in the hypothalamic control of food intake and energy balance. NPY also exerts an inhibition of the gonadotrope axis that could be important in the response to poor metabolic conditions. In contrast, leptin provides an anorexigenic signal to centrally control the body needs in energy. Moreover, leptin contributes to preserve adequate reproductive functions by stimulating the activity of the gonadotrope axis. It is of interest that hypothalamic NPY represents a primary target of leptin actions. To evaluate the importance of the NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors in the downstream pathways modulated by leptin and controlling energy metabolism as well as the activity of the gonadotrope axis, we studied the effects of leptin administration on food intake and reproductive functions in mice deficient for the expression of either the Y1 or the Y5 receptor. Furthermore, the role of the Y1 receptor in leptin resistance was determined in leptin-deficient ob/ob mice bearing a null mutation in the NPY Y1 locus. Results point to a crucial role for the NPY Y1 receptor in mediating the NPY pathways situated downstream of leptin actions and controlling food intake, the onset of puberty, and the maintenance of reproductive functions."

We now demonstrate that GLP-2, in a cycloheximide-insensitive manner, enhanced survival in baby hamster kidney cells stably transfected with the rat GLP-2R; reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c efflux; and attenuated the caspase-dependent cleavage of Akt, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and β-catenin following inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) by LY294002. The prosurvival effects of GLP-2 on LY294002-induced cell death were independent of Akt, p90Rsk, or p70 S6 kinase activation; were mimicked by forskolin; and were abrogated by inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA) activity. GLP-2 inhibited activation of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) through phosphorylation at Ser21 in GSK-3α and at Ser9 in GSK-3β in a PI3K-independent, PKA-dependent manner. GLP-2 reduced LY294002-induced mitochondrial association of endogenous Bad and Bax and stimulated phosphorylation of a transfected Bad fusion protein at Ser155 in a PI3K-independent, but H89-sensitive manner, a modification known to suppress Bad pro-apoptotic activity.

The majority of these actions are rapid, occur within minutes following activation of distinct hormone-specific G protein-coupled receptors, and serve to modulate the intake and assimilation of energy in both the fasting and postprandial states. The proglucagon gene is expressed in both the endocrine pancreas and intestine and, following tissue-specific processing of proglucagon, gives rise to multiple peptides, including glucagon in the endocrine pancreas and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),1 and glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) in the intestine (1Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Glucagon acts to maintain energy homeostasis through the hepatic control of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis and serves as the primary counter-regulatory hormone that opposes insulin action and thereby prevents hypoglycemia (2Gerich J. Langlois M. Noacco C. Karam J. Forsham P. Science. 1973; 182: 171-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In contrast, GLP-1 enhances the disposal of ingested nutrients via inhibition of glucagon secretion and stimulation of insulin secretion from the islet β cell. The acute metabolic actions of GLP-2 are less well understood; however, exogenous administration of GLP-2 inhibits gastric acid secretion and gastric motility, reduces intestinal permeability, and enhances intestinal hexose transport in rodentsin vivo (3Drucker D.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The most striking consequence of GLP-2 action is expansion of the small bowel mucosal epithelium. GLP-2 administration stimulates crypt cell proliferation, increases crypt and villus height, and augments mucosal surface area in both rats and mice (4Drucker D.J. Ehrlich P. Asa S.L. Brubaker P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7911-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar, 5Drucker D.J. Shi Q. Crivici A. Sumner-Smith M. Tavares W. Hill M. Deforest L. Cooper S. Brubaker P.L. Nat. Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 673-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, GLP-1 also exerts trophic effects in the endocrine pancreas, including stimulation of islet ductal neogenesis and β cell proliferation in normal rodentsin vivo and in β cell lines in vitro (6Xu G. Stoffers D.A. Habener J.F. Bonner-Weir S. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 2270-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar, 7Stoffers D.A. Kieffer T.J. Hussain M.A. Drucker D.J. Egan J.M. Bonner-Weir S. Habener J.F. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 741-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). These actions of GLP-1 and GLP-2 are preserved in experimental models of diabetes and intestinal disease, respectively; hence, activation of glucagon-like peptide receptor signaling pathways leads to enhanced cell proliferation in both normal and injured tissues in vivo. More recent data suggest that the glucagon-like peptides exert direct cytoprotective effects via inhibition of apoptosis either directly in target cells expressing their cognate receptors or indirectly via liberation of as yet unidentified survival factors. GLP-1 inhibits apoptosis in islet β cells or in heterologous baby hamster kidney (BHK) fibroblasts expressing a transfected GLP-1 receptor (8Bregenholt, S., Moldrup, A., Knudsen, L.

GLP-2 administration to rodents with experimental intestinal injury markedly attenuates mucosal damage and significantly reduces the extent of apoptosis in both the crypt and enterocyte compartments (10Boushey R.P.

As enriched populations of intestinal cells or cell lines that express the endogenous GLP-2 receptor (GLP-2R) have not yet been isolated and characterized in vitro, we established a cellular model for analysis of GLP-2R signal transduction in vitro. BHK fibroblasts stably transfected with the rat GLP-2R exhibit dose-dependent cAMP accumulation in response to GLP-2 administration (12Yusta B. Somwar R. Wang F. Munroe D. Grinstein S. Klip A. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30459-30467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Remarkably, induction of apoptosis in BHK-rGLP-2R cells with cycloheximide is markedly attenuated by GLP-2, in association with reduced mitochondrial cytochrome c efflux to the cytosol and diminished cleavage and activation of both initiator and effector caspases (13Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To understand the mechanisms stimulated by GLP-2R activation that couple cAMP accumulation to inhibition of cell death, we examined signaling molecules that represent potential anti-apoptotic targets following activation of the G protein-coupled GLP-2R. Tissue culture medium, serum, and G418 were from Invitrogen. Cycloheximide, forskolin, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), protease inhibitor mixture (P-2714), and phosphatase inhibitor mixture I were purchased from Sigma. Recombinant human [Gly2]GLP-2 (hereafter abbreviated GLP-2) was a kind gift from NPS Allelix Inc. (Mississauga, Canada). Recombinant human insulin was from Lilly. The pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone and the kinase inhibitors H89 and LY294002 were obtained from Calbiochem. All electrophoresis reagents were purchased from Bio-Rad. The expression vector MtR(AB) (16Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was a gift from G. S. McKnight. BHK fibroblasts containing the stably integrated pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) directing expression of the rat GLP-2R (BHK-rGLP-2R cells) were propagated as described previously (12Yusta B. Somwar R.

When used for experiments, cells were plated in culture medium lacking G418. Upon reaching 70–80% confluence, the cultures were maintained for 15–17 h in serum-depleted medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% calf serum) prior to apoptosis induction by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 in the same medium in the presence or absence of the indicated peptides or drugs for the indicated periods of time. Wortmannin, another widely used PI3K inhibitor, was as effective as LY294002 for transiently preventing serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, a marker of PI3K activation. However, unlike LY294002, the inhibition of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation by wortmannin (even at 1 μm) was not sustained and disappeared almost completely after 5–6 h of treatment. Consistent with these findings, cell viability was reduced only by ∼25% in the presence of wortmannin (data not shown); hence, wortmannin was not used in further experiments. GLP-2 and insulin were dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, forskolin, PMA, H89, and LY294002 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Control cultures were subjected to the same manipulations as treated cells, but in the absence of the drugs. Dimethyl sulfoxide final concentration was identical in every culture irrespective of the particular treatment group. The number of viable cells remaining following apoptosis induction was assessed by measuring the bioreduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt at 490 nm using the CellTiter 96 aqueous assay (Promega, Madison, WI). Following induction of apoptosis as indicated above, adherent cells were scrapped off the culture dishes, combined with detached cells floating in the medium, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in phosphate-buffered saline) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (both at 1:100 dilution), 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were cleared at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, boiled for 5 min with sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol, and stored at −70 °C until used. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. 30–40 μg of cell lysate were separated by discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electrotransferred onto Hybond-C nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using standard procedures. The resulting blot was blocked with 5% skim milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and next incubated with a designed primary antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at room temperature. Proteins were detected with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and an enhanced chemiluminescence commercial kit (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to p90Rsk phosphorylated at Ser380; Akt phosphorylated at Ser473 or Thr308; p70 S6 kinase phosphorylated at Thr389; p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylated at Thr202 and Tyr204; GSK-3α/β phosphorylated at Ser21 and Ser9, respectively; and GSK-3β phosphorylated at Ser9 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA) were used at 1:1000 dilution to detect the catalytically active forms of the kinases. Primary antibodies reactive to phospho-Bad Ser112, phospho-Bad Ser155, Akt, Bad, Bax, and IκBα (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase antibody (BD PharMingen) was used at 1:4000 dilution. Anti-cytochrome c antibody (BIOSOURCE, International, Camarillo, CA) was used at 1 μg/ml. Anti-porin 31HL/VDAC antibody (Calbiochem) was used at 2 μg/ml. Antibodies against β-catenin (BD PharMingen) were used at 1:500 dilution, and antibodies against actin (Sigma) were used at 1:5000 dilution. The anti-actin and anti-IκBα polyclonal antibodies were utilized to monitor loading and transfer conditions. Densitometry was performed on blots exposed on Biomax MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet 3p scanner and NIH Image software. Transfection of BHK-rGLP-2R cells was done in 60-mm dishes using Lipofectin reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the cell survival assay, cultures were transfected with 1 μg of a Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression plasmid plus 3 μg of pBluescript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) carrier DNA or with the β-galactosidase reporter plasmid plus 3 μg of MtR(AB) expression vector. After transfection, cultures were maintained in serum-depleted medium for 15–17 h and then incubated with LY294002 in the presence or absence of the indicated drugs. Adherent cells were collected, and β-galactosidase activity was determined as described previously (13Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The loss of β-galactosidase activity in these assays reflects cell death and elimination of the transfected cells (14Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M.B. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). For assessment of the site-specific phosphorylation of Bad in response to different agonists, cells were transfected with 1.4 μg of the pEBG-mBad expression plasmid (Cell Signaling Technology) and carrier DNA for a total of 4 μg. Following transfection, cells were incubated for 24 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and for 18–20 h in serum-depleted medium. Cultures were treated with the indicated drugs and then prepared for immunoblot analysis as described above. Membrane fractions enriched in mitochondrial or cytosolic fractions were prepared by differential centrifugation as previously described (13Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined before preparing the samples for immunoblot analysis as specified above. For assessment of statistical significance, data were analyzed using analysis of variance, and group comparisons were done using Bonferroni's multiple comparison post-test. To ascertain the importance of PI3K-dependent signaling for GLP-2-mediated cell survival, we examined the effect of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 on viability in BHK-rGLP-2R cells. Incubation with LY294002 alone induced a marked reduction in cell viability, whereas co-administration of GLP-2 in the presence of LY294002 for 6.5 h significantly increased cell survival (Fig.1 A). The inhibitory effect of GLP-2 on LY294002-induced cell death was mimicked by forskolin (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that cAMP plays a role in the protective effect of GLP-2. We have previously shown that cycloheximide at concentrations that inhibit translation by >95% induces cell death and the biochemical and morphological changes of apoptosis in BHK-rGLP-2R cells (13Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The combined administration of both LY294002 and cycloheximide markedly reduced cell viability to ∼12%, clearly below that observed with either agent alone (Fig. 1 A). However, treatment of cells with either GLP-2 or forskolin significantly reduced cell death induced by these agents (Fig. 1 A), indicating that de novo protein synthesis is not required for the inhibitory effect of GLP-2 or forskolin on LY294002-induced cell death. To determine the time period required for coupling of GLP-2R activation to a reduction in LY294002-associated cell death, separate groups of cells were pretreated with LY294002, following which either GLP-2 or forskolin was added at various time points prior to analysis of cell viability 7.3 h after addition of LY294002 as shown in Fig.1 B. Both GLP-2 and forskolin significantly enhanced cell viability at all time points examined (Fig. 1 B). The effectiveness of LY294002 for sustained inhibition of PI3K in BHK-rGLP-2R cells during the 6–7-h time frame utilized for the viability experiments was assessed by examining the phosphorylation of the protein kinase Akt, a downstream target of PI3K signaling (15Chan T.O. Rittenhouse S.E. Tsichlis P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 965-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). As PI3K-dependent phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473 is necessary and sufficient for the activation of Akt, we used phosphorylation site-specific antibodies to detect catalytically active Akt as a marker of PI3K activation in vitro. Western blot analysis of serum-starved BHK-rGLP-2R cells re-treated with fetal bovine serum demonstrated a robust Akt Ser473 phosphorylation from 5 to 360 min following exposure to serum (Fig. 1 C). In contrast, co-administration of LY294002 completely abrogated the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt Ser473 during the entire time course of the experiment (Fig. 1 C). These results illustrate the efficacy of LY294002 as an inhibitor of PI3K/Akt signaling in BHK-rGLP-2R cells. The relative specificity of LY294002 was confirmed by demonstrating preserved serum-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in BHK-rGLP-2R cells in the presence or absence of LY294002 (Fig. 1 C). Following treatment with LY294002, BHK-rGLP-2R cells exhibited morphological features typically associated with cell apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, and detachment as well as cell fragmentation into apoptotic bodies (Ref. 13Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar and data not shown). To ascertain whether reduced LY294002-associated cell viability is associated with biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis, we assessed mitochondrial release of apoptogenic cytochrome c and, separately, caspase activation by monitoring the cleavage of characteristic effector caspase substrates in the presence and absence of LY294002. Cells treated with LY294002 alone exhibited reduced levels of total Akt and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and β-catenin (Fig. 2, A andB), and these effects were prevented by the pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone (Fig.2 A). In contrast, cells treated with LY294002 and either GLP-2 or forskolin exhibited preserved levels of Akt and reduced cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and β-catenin (Fig.2 B). LY294002 treatment of BHK-rGLP-2R cells was also associated with an increase in the levels of cytosolic cytochromec that was reduced by GLP-2 or forskolin (Fig.2 C). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that GLP-2 enhances cell survival and reduces mitochondrial cytochromec efflux, caspase activation, and the subsequent cleavage of downstream targets of executioner caspases in a PI3K- and Akt-independent manner. Engagement of the GLP-1 and GLP-2 receptors leads to increased adenylate cyclase activity, increased levels of intracellular cAMP, and activation of protein kinase A (PKA) (1Drucker D.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In the setting of cycloheximide-induced apoptosis, GLP-2 reduces caspase activation and enhances cell survival in a PKA-independent manner (13Yusta B. Boushey R.P. Drucker D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35345-35352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the LY294002-mediated reduction in BHK-rGLP-2R cell viability was not reversed by GLP-2 or forskolin in the presence of the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 3). A transient transfection death assay was used to verify the PKA dependence of the GLP-2 effect on cell survival in the presence of LY294002. Cells were cotransfected with the Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid alone or in combination with MtR(AB), a vector encoding a dominant-negative regulatory subunit of PKA (16Clegg C.H. Correll L.A. Cadd G.G. McKnight G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13111-13119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and then exposed to LY294002 with or without GLP-2 or forskolin. The amount of β-galactosidase activity detected in intact adherent cells provides a readout for the number of viable transfected cells, whereas a decrease in reporter gene activity indicates cell death (14Memon S.A. Petrak D. Moreno M.B. Zacharchuk C.M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 180: 15-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In contrast to the levels of β-galactosidase activity detected in GLP-2-treated cells co-incubated with LY294002, cotransfection with MtR(AB) completely eliminated the GLP-2- or forskolin-stimulated enhancement of β-galactosidase activity in BHK-rGLP-2R cells exposed to LY294002 (Fig. 3), providing complementary evidence that PKA activity is required for the protective effect of GLP-2 and forskolin on LY294002-induced cell death. These results implied that the GLP-2- and forskolin-mediated rescue of BHK-rGLP-2R cells from LY294002-induced apoptosis required PKA activity, but was likely independent of Akt activation, as LY294002 is a potent and long-lasting inhibitor of PI3K and Akt activation under the experimental conditions used for our studies (see Fig.1 C). However, cAMP and PKA have been shown to induce a PI3K-independent activation of Akt that is dependent on Thr308 phosphorylation, but not Ser473phosphorylation (17Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 18Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that PKA might transduce GLP-2-mediated survival in BHK-rGLP-2R cells via regulation of Akt. To address whether GLP-2 activates Akt in BHK-rGLP-2R cells, we incubated cells with GLP-2 or forskolin for 5–60 min, following which the phosphorylation state of Akt was assessed by Western blotting using phosphorylation-specific antisera directed against Ser473and Thr308. Whereas insulin treatment of BHK-rGLP-2R cells rapidly induced Akt phosphorylation within 15 min, no phosphorylation of Akt at the two critical residues that activate the kinase was detected following treatment with forskolin or GLP-2 (Fig.4). When the same experiments were performed in the presence of LY294002, the levels of phosphorylated Akt were markedly reduced, and no evidence for either GLP-2- or forskolin-induced Akt phosphorylation was observed (data not shown). These observations suggest that Akt does not mediate the survival effects of cAMP/PKA in LY294002-treated BHK-rGLP-2R cells. As p70 S6 kinase is a downstream effector of PI3K and may potentially regulate changes in cell proliferation or apoptosis (19Harada H. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Terada N. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9666-9670Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), we examined whether GLP-2 activates p70 S6 kinase in the presence or absence of LY294002 using anti-phospho-p70 S6 kinase Thr389 antibody, as the activity of p70 S6 kinase in vivo most closely correlates with the phosphorylation state of Thr389 (20Weng Q.P. Kozlowski M. Belham C. Zhang A. Comb M.J. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16621-16629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although insulin activated Thr389 phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase in BHK-rGLP-2R cells, no increase in Thr389phosphorylation was detected following exposure of cells to forskolin or GLP-2 (Fig. 5). Furthermore, LY294002 completely abolished p70 S6 kinase Thr389 phosphorylation in the presence or absence of GLP-2 or forskolin (data not shown). Similarly, we next examined whether GLP-2 might exert its effects on cell survival via activation of p90Rsk, a ribosomal kinase that exerts anti-apoptotic effects on downstream effectors such as Bad (21Bertolotto C. Maulon L. Filippa N. Baier G. Auberger P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37246-37250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 22Bonni A. Brunet A. West A.E. Datta S.R. Takasu M.A. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1358-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Although phorbol esters stimulated phosphorylation of p90Rsk at Ser380, which is critical for the activation of this kinase (23Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), GLP-2 or forskolin had no effect on p90Rsk Ser380 phosphorylation in the presence (data not shown) or absence (Fig. 5) of LY294002. To determine the mechanisms underlying the reduced cell survival in LY294002-treated BHK-rGLP-2R cells and to identify candidate GLP-2-responsive molecules that control cell survival, we examined the phosphorylation state of GSK-3, a downstream target of both the PI3K/Akt (24Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar) and cAMP/PKA (25Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C., Jr. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, activation of Akt and PKA in response to a variety of physiological stimuli has been demonstrated to rapidly phosphorylate GSK-3 at Ser21 in GSK-3α and at Ser9 in GSK-3β, resulting in inhibition of GSK-3 kinase activity and promotion of survival (24Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar, 25Fang X., Yu, S.X., Lu, Y. Bast R.C., Jr. Woodgett J.R. Mills G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Incubation of BHK-rGLP-2R cells with LY294002 produced a rapid reduction in the levels of Akt Ser473 phosphorylation, which was mirrored by a comparably rapid reduction in the levels of catalytically inactive GSK-3α and GSK-3β phosphorylated at Ser21 and Ser9, respectively (Fig.6). Stimulation of BHK-rGLP-2R cells with GLP-2 and, to a greater extent, with forskolin increased the levels of phosphorylated GSK-3α and GSK-3β at Ser21 and Ser9, respectively (Fig. 7,A and C). The ability of GLP-2 and forskolin to augment levels of catalytically inactive phosphorylated GSK-3 was reversed by H89 (Fig. 7, B and C), implicating an essential role for PKA as a downstream effector connecting GLP-2R signaling to GSK-3 phosphorylation independently of PI3K/Akt, p90Rsk, and p70 S6 kinase.Figure 7GLP-2 and forskolin induce phosphorylation of GSK-3 in a PI3K-independent, PKA-dependent manner in BHK-rGLP-2R cells. Serum-starved cultures were incubated for 45 min with LY294002 (A) or LY294002 + H89 (B) before stimulation by GLP-2 and forskolin for the indicated times. Extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis was performed to monitor GSK-3 phosphorylation. Anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β Ser21/9 (P(S21/S9)GSK-3α/β) antibody was used to detect GSK-3α phosphorylation at Ser21. GSK-3β phosphorylation was examined using anti-phospho-GSK-3β Ser9 (P(S9)GSK-3β) antibody, which demonstrated higher sensitivity than anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β Ser21/9 antibody for the β isoform of GSK-3. Loading and transfer conditions were verified by reprobing the blots with anti-actin polyclonal antibody. Shown"
https://openalex.org/W2069732826,"The beta-thymosins constitute a family of highly conserved and extremely water-soluble 5 kDa polypeptides. Thymosin beta4 is the most abundant member; it is expressed in most cell types and is regarded as the main intracellular G-actin sequestering peptide. There is increasing evidence for extracellular functions of thymosin beta4. For example, thymosin beta4 increases the rate of attachment and spreading of endothelial cells on matrix components and stimulates the migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Here we show that thymosin beta4 can be cross-linked to proteins such as fibrin and collagen by tissue transglutaminase. Thymosin beta4 is not cross-linked to many other proteins and its cross-linking to fibrin is competed by another family member, thymosin beta10. After activation of human platelets with thrombin, thymosin beta4 is released and cross-linked to fibrin in a time- and calcium-dependent manner. We suggest that thymosin beta4 cross-linking is mediated by factor XIIIa, a transglutaminase that is coreleased from stimulated platelets. This provides a mechanism to increase the local concentration of thymosin beta4 near sites of clots and tissue damage, where it may contribute to wound healing, angiogenesis and inflammatory responses."

We have recently shown that C/EBPα function is also impaired in acute myeloid leukemias. However, how the transcriptional activity of C/EBPα is regulated both in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis is not fully understood. The current study demonstrates that activated Ras enhances the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter and a minimal promoter containing only C/EBP DNA binding sites. Ras signaling activates C/EBPα via the transactivation domain because it enhances the transactivation function of a fusion protein containing a Gal4 DNA binding domain and the C/EBPα transactivation domain and does not change C/EBPα DNA binding. Ras acts on serine 248 of the C/EBPα transactivation domain, because it does not enhance the transactivation function of a C/EBPα serine 248 to alanine point mutant. Interestingly, serine 248 of C/EBPα is a protein kinase C (PKC) consensus site, and a PKC inhibitor blocks the activation of C/EBPα by Ras. Ras signaling leads to phosphorylation of C/EBPαin vivo. Finally, mutation of serine 248 to alanine obviates the ability of C/EBPα to induce granulocytic differentiation.

These studies point to the crucial role of C/EBPα in both normal myeloid differentiation and leukemogenesis. However, how the transcriptional activity of C/EBPα is regulated both in normal myelopoiesis as well as in leukemogenesis is not fully understood. The Ras family of proteins are GTP-dependent molecular switches that are essential for cell growth and differentiation (12McCormick F. Mol. Reprod.

Ras exerts its effect on cell growth mainly via ETS (14Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar) and AP-1 (15Johnson R. Spiegelman B.

For example, cells with a null mutation in the c-jun gene and expressing oncogenic Ras lack many characteristics of Ras transformation (15Johnson R. Spiegelman B. Hanahan D. Wisdom R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4504-4511Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), and dominant negative mutants of ETS-1, ETS-2, or PU.1 containing only the DNA binding domain inhibit Ras activation of transcription and revert Ras-transformed cells (14Wasylyk C. Maira S.M. Sobieszczuk P. Wasylyk B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3665-3673PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, Ras has been demonstrated to play an important role in myeloid differentiation. Macrophage differentiation and macrophage-colony-stimulating factor-dependent survival are altered in transgenic mice that express dominant suppressors of Ras signaling (16Jin D.I. Jameson S.B. Reddy M.A. Schenkman D. Ostrowski M.C. Mol. Cell.

Because Ras signaling and the transcription factor C/EBPα both play important roles in myeloid differentiation, we hypothesized that Ras might be involved in the activation of C/EBPα. Here we demonstrate data that suggest a model where Ras signaling phosphorylates C/EBPα on serine 248 of the transactivation domain, resulting in an enhancement of the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate the G-CSF1 receptor promoter, which contributes to the induction of granulocytic differentiation. Human kidney 293T cells and human kidney 293E1A cells (kindly provided by John Blenis, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone). 32D cl3 cells were maintained in phenol-red free Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1 ng/ml interleukin-3 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), and penicillin-streptomycin. ϕCRE cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% heat-inactivated calf serum and penicillin-streptomycin. pBabePuro-C/EBPα(S248A)-ER was introduced into ϕCRE cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and a pool of resistant cells was isolated using 2 μg/ml puromycin. 32D cl3 cells were co-cultured in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene with ϕCRE-S248A cells that had been irradiated. After 48 h, the 32D cl3 cells were placed in 96-well dishes with 2 μg/ml puromycin, and individual subclones were isolated. Estradiol was employed at 1 μm. Morphology was assessed by Wright's-Giemsa staining of cytospins. pBabePuro-C/EBPα(S48A)-ER was constructed by ligating an MluI/NcoI segment containing the mutant serine in place of the identical fragment in pBabePuro-C/EBPαWT-ER. Total cellular extracts were subjected to Western blotting using antiserum recognizing human ERα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA) or murine actin (Sigma). The human G-CSF receptor promoter ranging from bp −74 to +67 with respect to the major transcription start site (20Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned in the firefly luciferase vector pXP2 (21Nordeen S.K. Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). pTK driven by 2 C/EBP sites (p(C/EBP)2TK) is a dimer of the C/EBP site from the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter from bp −57 to bp −37 with respect to the major transcription start site (20Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G.

Biotechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458PubMed Google Scholar). As an internal control plasmid for co-transfection assays, the pRL-null construct driving a Renilla luciferase gene (Promega, Madison, WI) was used as described before (22Behre G. Whitmarsh A.J.

The expression plasmids pMSV-C/EBPα (rat), various deletions mutants of C/EBPα in pMSV, pMSV-C/EBPβ, pMSV-C/EBPδ, GAL4-C/EBPα area 1–9, GAL4-C/EBPα area 1–3, and GAL4-C/EBPα area 4–9, and a minimal promoter with GAL4 DNA binding sites were described previously (25Friedman A.D.

A serine to alanine point mutation at serine 248 of rat C/EBPα was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. 293T cells or 293E1A cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Firefly luciferase activities from the constructs pG-CSFR, pXP2, pGal4-DBD, pTK, and p(C/EBP)2TK andRenilla luciferase activity from the internal control plasmid pRL-null were determined 24 h after the initiation of the transfection protocols using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized to theRenilla luciferase values of pRL-null. Results are given as the means ± S.E. of at least six independent experiments. The DNA concentrations of the reporter constructs and expression plasmids used for LipofectAMINE Plus transfections were 0.1 μg of pG-CSFR, pXP2, pGal4-DBD, pTK, and p(C/EBP)2TK, 0.01 μg of the internal control plasmid pRL-null, 0.1 μg of the expression plasmids for C/EBPα and C/EBPα mutants and for Ras(L61); the same concentrations of the empty expression vectors were used as controls, respectively. In the transfections without cotransfection of Ras, the empty vector pMT3 was included instead of pMT3-Ras. pRL-null was chosen as the internal control plasmid, because it was not transactivated by Ras in 293T cells (22Behre G. Whitmarsh A.J. Coghlan M.P. Hoang T. Carpenter C.L. Zhang D.-E. Davis R.J. Tenen D.G. J. Biol.

As a positive control for C/EBPα binding, a double-stranded C/EBPα probe from the human G-CSF receptor promoter (bp −57 to −37 with respect to the major transcription start site, as described before in Fig. 9 of Ref. 20Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; OligoA (AAG GTG TTG CAA TCC CCA GC) and OligoB (GCT GGG GAT TGC AAC ACC TT)) was labeled with Klenow polymerase and [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated with 0.1 μg/μl double-stranded poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) with 1 μl ofin vitro translated C/EBPα. In some experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of the C/EBP probe was added as specific unlabeled competitor. C/EBPα antibody (14AA) was used for gel supershift (Cat #SC61 X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect changes in the phosphorylation pattern of C/EBPα upon stimulation with activated Ras in vivo, 0.5 μg of pcDNA3-C/EBPα or pcDNA3-C/EBPαS248A either with or without 0.25 μg of activated Ras(L61), was transfected into 293T cells using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen). 3 h after transfection, cells were starved in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After 18 h, cells were placed into serum-free and phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) for 30 min before they were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate (2.5 mCi/ml). After 4 h, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and supplemented with aprotinin, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin as protease inhibitors (Sigma) and sodium pyrophosphate, sodium fluoride, and sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma). In parallel plates, 0.3 μg of the G-CSF receptor promoter was co-transfected in 293T cells, and luciferase activities were determined to ensure that Ras signaling enhances the transactivation function of C/EBPα in the particular experiment used in in vivo labeling and subsequent phosphopeptide mapping. C/EBPα was isolated by immunoprecipitation from the lysates using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against C/EBPα (Santa Cruz), washed four times with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad) for phosphopeptide mapping. After transfer, the C/EBPα protein bands was excised. To determine the phosphorylated protein residues of C/EBPα, C/EBPα protein bands were digested with 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin (Worthington) and endoproteinase Glu-C (V8 protease) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and processed for phosphopeptide mapping as described previously (29Boyle W.J. Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). 24 h after the start of transfection, cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with anti-C/EBPα antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or β-tubulin antibody as an internal control (catalog #1111876; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 60 min and then with protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences) for 45 min. Signals were detected with ECL Western blotting detection reagents (AmershamBiosciences). In parallel plates, the G-CSF receptor promoter construct was co-transfected, and luciferase activities were determined to ensure that Ras enhances the transactivation function of C/EBPα in the particular experiment used for Western blot analysis of C/EBPα expression and that the transfection efficacy was the same (less than 10% difference between plates) in the particular experiment. Differences in protein expression were quantitated by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). C/EBPα antibody (14AA, SC61) was used for Western blot and immunoprecipitation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Because Ras and the regulation of the G-CSF receptor by C/EBPα are both important for myeloid development, we asked whether activated Ras enhances the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate the G-CSF receptor promoter. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid containing the human G-CSF receptor promoter (20Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene along with expression plasmids for C/EBPα and Ras, and reporter gene expression was determined 24 h post-transfection. Transfection of a Ras expression construct significantly enhanced the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate the G-CSF receptor promoter (Fig.1 A). The same effect was demonstrated in myeloid U937 cells as well (Fig. 1 D). Western blot analysis for C/EBPα expression demonstrated that activated Ras did not change the expression level of cotransfected C/EBPα (Fig. 1 B). Thus, Ras signaling directly acts on the transactivation capacity of C/EBPα. The cooperation of activated Ras with C/EBPα is therefore important for G-CSF receptor promoter activity. We next asked the questions of (a) whether the binding of C/EBPα to DNA was necessary for its activation by Ras and (b) whether a C/EBPα binding site alone was sufficient for the Ras-enhanced C/EBPα activation. We observed enhanced C/EBPα transactivation mediated by activated Ras using a reporter construct containing two C/EBPα binding sites cloned upstream of a minimal TK promoter (p(C/EBP)TK) (Fig. 1 C). In control experiments, no effect of Ras on C/EBPα activity was observed when the minimal TK promoter without C/EBPα binding sites was used (Fig. 1 C). These data indicate that C/EBPα binding to DNA is necessary for its activation by Ras signaling and that C/EBPα binding sites are sufficient to mediate this effect. Interestingly, the activation of C/EBPα by Ras was specific for C/EBPα, because C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ were not activated functionally by Ras signaling in this assay (Fig. 1 C). To map the domain of C/EBPα activated by Ras signaling, we used a minimal promoter with GAL4 DNA binding sites and the expression plasmids GAL4-C/EBPα area 1–9, GAL4-C/EBPα area 1–3, and GAL4-C/EBPα area 4–9 using the previously described nomenclature (25Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1416-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) to refer to the areas of the C/EBPα transactivation domain (Fig. 2,A and B). Ras signaling activated a fusion protein containing the GAL4-DNA binding domain and the transactivation domains of C/EBPα (areas 1–9). Areas 1–3 of C/EBPα were not activated by Ras, whereas areas 4–9 were still activated by Ras. These data indicate that Ras signaling might act on areas 4–9 of the transactivation domain of C/EBPα. To further elucidate the mechanism by which Ras augments the transcriptional activity of C/EBPα, we performed experiments to determine whether the activation of C/EBPα by Ras was partly due to an increase of C/EBPα DNA binding. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using a bp −57 to −37 G-CSF receptor promoter fragment containing its C/EBPα binding site (20Smith L.T. Hohaus S. Gonzalez D.A. Dziennis S.E. Tenen D.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 1234-1247Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A positive control,in vitro translated C/EBPα, specifically bound to this probe as expected (Fig. 2 C). Nuclear extracts from 293T cells transfected with the expression plasmid of C/EBPα with or without cotransfection of Ras bound to the oligo as well, and most importantly, Ras signaling did not change the DNA binding of C/EBPα. To rule out different C/EBPα protein contents of the nuclear extracts used, we performed a Western blot analysis for C/EBPα expression (Fig. 2 D), which showed equal loading of C/EBPα. These results indicate that binding of C/EBPα to the G-CSF receptor promoter DNA is not enhanced by Ras signaling. To further localize the site of C/EBPα activated by Ras signaling and to fine-map this site, we used various deletion mutants of C/EBPα (Fig. 3,A and B). C/EBPαΔ4–9 was minimally activated, and C/EBPαΔ9 was not activated by Ras. All other mutants were activated at least 2-fold by Ras. These studies demonstrate that Ras acts on area 9 of C/EBPα. Because Ras acts on area 9 of the transactivation domain of C/EBPα, we focused on this area for generating C/EBPα point mutants. Area 9 of C/EBPα is depicted in detail in Fig.4 B. There is only one potential phosphorylation consensus site in area 9, at serine 248. We generated a point mutant of C/EBPα at serine 248 by mutation to alanine (C/EBPαS248A). C/EBPα wild type and C/EBPαS248A both transactivated the G-CSF receptor promoter 20-fold. Although Ras signaling enhanced wild type C/EBPα transactivation capacity from 20- to 60-fold, Ras only enhanced the transactivation capacity of the S248A mutant of C/EBPα from 20- to 29-fold (Fig. 3 C). These results suggest that Ras signaling might act on serine 248 of the C/EBPα transactivation domain to enhance C/EBPα transcriptional activity. Because serine 248 is a potential PKC consensus site (Fig. 4 B), we asked whether a PKC inhibitor (staurosporine at 20 nm final concentration) could block the activation of C/EBPα by Ras signaling. In fact, pretreatment of 293T cells with staurosporine abolished the activation of C/EBPα by Ras signaling (Fig. 4 A). These results support the hypothesis that the PKC pathway could be involved in the Ras-mediated activation of C/EBPα. Because our data suggest that Ras activates C/EBPα via phosphorylation on serine 248, we wanted to prove that Ras signaling in fact phosphorylates C/EBPα on serine 248 in vivo. 293T cells were transfected with p(C/EBP)2TK and with the expression plasmids for C/EBPα or C/EBPαS248A and/or activated Ras. Phosphopeptide mapping of cells transfected with C/EBPα, C/EBPαS248A, C/EBPα plus Ras, and C/EBPαS248A plus Ras was performed. Ras signaling (Fig.5 C) enhanced a phosphorylation spot in the C/EBPα pattern (Fig. 5 A) that was not visible in C/EBPαS248A (Fig. 5 B) or C/EBPαS248A plus cotransfected Ras (Fig. 5 D). Thus, we conclude that Ras signaling phosphorylates C/EBPα on serine 248 in vivo. To determine the biological importance of serine 248, we linked C/EBPα(S248A) to the human estradiol receptor (ERα) ligand binding domain and isolated 32D cl3 cell lines expressing this protein. Two subclones with protein expression as high as that we previously achieved for C/EBPαWT-ER were obtained (Fig. 6 A). In 32D-C/EBPα(S248A)-ER-1 cells, the full-length species reproducibly migrated faster than that found for clone 2 cells or for cells expressing the wild type protein. Smaller species, likely representing degradation products, and a larger species (Fig. 6 A,arrow), likely representing a dimer formed via the leucine zipper, also ran faster than comparable bands in the other lanes. Perhaps this difference in migration represents altered phosphorylation at serine 248 or at another residue. It is not clear why this faster migration was only seen with one subclone but may represent heterogeneity in the 32D cl3 cells themselves. To assess induction of differentiation by C/EBPα(S248A)-ER, each of the cell lines was placed in estradiol. Morphologically, after 3 days, the majority of 32D-C/EBPα(WT)-ER cells had differentiated to neutrophils (Fig. 6 B, left panels), whereas little morphologic change was seen with 32D-C/EBPα(S248A)-ER-1 cells and clone 2 developed primary granules without nuclear maturation (Fig6 B, middle and right panels). To further assess differentiation, RNAs prepared daily from cultures exposed to estradiol were subjected to Northern blotting for MPO, LF, and β-actin (Fig. 6 C). As reported previously, C/EBPαWT-ER rapidly induced MPO and induced LF after 48 h. In contrast, in 32D-C/EBPα(S248A)-ER-1 cells, neither MPO nor LF were induced, and in clone 2 cells, MPO was induced in a delayed fashion and LF was not induced. Mutation of serine 248 to alanine did not prevent the growth inhibitory properties of C/EBPαWT-ER in 32D cl3 cells (data not shown). Because Ras signaling and the transcription factor C/EBPα play important roles in myeloid differentiation, we hypothesized that Ras might be involved in the activation of C/EBPα. Here we demonstrate that Ras signaling phosphorylates C/EBPα on serine 248 of the transactivation domain, resulting in an enhancement of its transactivation capacity. These data link the Ras pathway, which is involved in myelopoiesis (30Crespo P. Leon J. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1613-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and acute myeloid leukemia (31Schaich M. Ritter M. Illmer T. Lisske P. Thiede C. Schakel U. Mohr B. Ehninger G. Neubauer A. Br. J. Haematol. 2001; 112: 300-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 32Zuber J. Tchernitsa O.I. Hinzmann B. Schmitz A.C. Grips M. Hellriegel M. Sers C. Rosenthal A. Schafer R. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 144-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), to the differentiation-inducing C/EBPα pathway. Thus, activated Ras enhances the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate the G-CSF receptor promoter and a minimal TK promoter containing C/EBP DNA binding sites from 10- to 40-fold (Fig. 1). The major role of phosphorylation sites in the activation and deactivation of C/EBP family members has already been described by other groups. Ford et al. (33Ford A.M. Bennett C.A. Healy L.E. Towatari M. Greaves M.F. Enver T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) suggest that C/EBPα exists in multiple phosphorylated forms in the nucleus of both multipotential and granulocytic-committed cells (33Ford A.M. Bennett C.A. Healy L.E. Towatari M. Greaves M.F. Enver T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10838-10843Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that C/EBPβ is expressed in both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms in blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (34Iida H. Towatari M. Iida M. Tanimoto M. Kodera Y. Ford A.M. Saito H. Int. J. Hematol. 2000; 71: 153-158PubMed Google Scholar). In terms of C/EBPβ, a regulation by the Ras signal transduction pathway and Ras-induced phosphorylation of C/EBPβ on threonine-235 is already known (35Nakajima T. Kinoshita S. Sasagawa T. Sasaki K. Naruto M. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2207-2211Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2 have been reported to mediate interferon-γ responsiveness of C/EBPβ (36Hu J. Roy S.K. Shapiro P.S. Rodig S.R. Reddy S.P. Platanias L.C. Schreiber R.D. Kalvakolanu D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Regarding C/EBPα, Mahoney et al. (37Mahoney C.W. Shuman J. McKnight S.L. Chen H.C. Huang K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19396-19403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that phosphorylation of C/EBPα in vitro by protein kinase C attenuates its site-selective DNA binding . Subsequently, Pan et al. (38Pan Z. Hetherington C.J. Zhang D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23242-23248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) could identify a specific increase in DNA binding and the expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ during U937 monocytic cell differentiation and related this to the transforming growth factor β-signaling pathway. Our data do not relate the effect of Ras signaling to the DNA binding domain or DNA binding capacity of C/EBPα. Ras signaling acts on the C/EBPα transactivation domain, because it enhances 4-fold the transactivation function of a fusion protein containing a Gal4 DNA binding domain and the C/EBPα transactivation domain (Fig. 2 A) and does not change the C/EBPα DNA binding capacity (Fig. 2 C). In fact, Ras acts on serine 248 of the C/EBPα transactivation domain, because it does not enhance the 10-fold transactivation exhibited by a C/EBPα mutant with a deletion of area 9 (Fig. 3 A) or a serine 248 to alanine point mutant in area 9 (Fig. 3 C). Thus, we conclude that the Ras pathway acts on the transactivation functions of C/EBPα via serine 248. Ross et al. (39Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar) report on other important phosphorylation sites in the transactivation domain of C/EBPα. Thus, GSK3 kinase phosphorylates C/EBPα on threonines 222 and 226 (39Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Wnt signaling maintains preadipocytes in an undifferentiated state and the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPα and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ are not expressed. When Wnt signaling in preadipocytes is prevented by overexpression of axin or dominant-negative TCF4, these cells differentiate into adipocytes (40Ross S.E. Hemati N. Longo K.A. Bennett C.N. Lucas P.C. Erickson R.L. MacDougald O.A. Science. 2000; 289: 950-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Our data in 293T cells point to serine 248 as the major Ras-dependent phosphorylation site of C/EBPα. Serine 248 of C/EBPα is a PKC consensus site, and a PKC inhibitor blocks the activation of C/EBPα by Ras (Fig.4 A). However, staurosporine is not completely specific for PKC. Therefore, we have not excluded other kinases as responsible for the activation of C/EBPα by Ras. The serine to alanine mutant of C/EBPα did not completely eliminate the activation of C/EBPα by Ras (Fig. 3 C), whereas deletion of region 9 did (Fig. 3 A). Perhaps a transcriptional co-activator binds optimally to C/EBPα when serine 248 is phosphorylated (Fig. 5 E) but can still bind weakly to the S248A mutant. In this model the effect of Ras on C/EBPα transactivation is at least partly indirect via a co-activator. This model is supported by the ability of Ras to induce basal activity of p(C/EBP)TK; on the other hand, our observation that Ras increases phosphorylation of a C/EBPα peptide but not of the same peptide from C/EBPαS248A suggests a more direct effect on C/EBPα by Ras (Fig.5 E). It is also possible that phosphorylation of serine 230 (39Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Hemati N. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) might account for additional effects of Ras on C/EBPα. However, we could not observe any loss of enhancement of transactivation capacity of C/EBPα by Ras signaling using the serine 230 to alanine mutant of C/EBPα (data not shown; the mutants were kindly provided by Dr. MacDougald, Ann Arbor, MI). However, the very likely additional Ras-dependent phosphorylation sites in C/EBPα besides serine 248 (Fig. 5, A–D) still need to be mapped and to be tested functionally. Our current studies to identify interacting proteins of C/EBPα using proteomics techniques (two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry) might also contribute to answering the question of whether the effect of Ras signaling on serine 248 of C/EBPα requires a co-activator binding to serine 248 or not. Mutation of serine 248 to alanine had marked biologic consequences in 32D cl3 cells, obviating the ability of C/EBPα to induce differentiation (Fig. 6). Whether this represents a defect in Ras-dependent phosphorylation of this serine and consequent alteration of trans-activating properties in myeloid cells or whether it represents a more indirect effect in which a Ras-dependent pathway interacts with serine 248 or with another site in C/EBPα affected by mutation of serine 248 to alanine remains to be determined. Further studies need to address the biological significance of serine 248 of C/EBPα by testing the serine to alanine 248 C/EBPα mutant in biological assays of C/EBPα function such as in rescue assays in C/EBPα knock-out mice. Of note, G-CSF, but not interleukin-3, signals cooperate with C/EBPα to induce myeloid genes in Ba/F3 lymphoid cells (41Wang W. Wang X. Ward AC Touw I.P. Friedman A.D. Leukemia (Baltimore). 2001; 15: 779-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Because impairment of C/EBPα function can contribute to the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (10Pabst T.

In summary, our data suggest that Ras signaling phosphorylates C/EBPα on serine 248 of the transactivation domain, resulting in an enhancement of the ability of C/EBPα to transactivate the G-CSF receptor promoter. Furthermore, our data suggest a model where Ras signaling enhances the activity of C/EBPα to induce granulocytic differentiation by phosphorylation of serine 248."

The enzyme is composed of two separately purifiable proteins, the iron (Fe) protein and the molybdenum-iron (MoFe)1 protein. The Fe Protein is a 60-kDa dimer of two identical subunits encoded by thenifH gene. The two subunits are bridged by a [4Fe-4S] cluster, and each subunit has a binding site for MgATP. The more complicated MoFe protein is a 230-kDa α2β2tetramer with the α and β subunits encoded by the nifDand nifK genes, respectively. The MoFe protein contains two different types of metal clusters, the [8Fe-7S] cluster (P-cluster) bridged between each αβ subunit pair and the [Mo-7Fe-9S-homocitrate] cluster (FeMoco) located within each α subunits. Substrate reduction by the enzyme requires both component proteins, with the Fe protein serving as a specific reductant of the MoFe protein, which in turn provides the site of substrate reduction. To carry out the catalytic function of nitrogenase, the reduced Fe protein first binds two molecules of MgATP and undergoes a conformational change before forming a complex with the MoFe protein. Then, coupled with MgATP hydrolysis, electrons are transferred from the Fe protein to the P-clusters of the MoFe protein within the complex. This process is followed by the dissociation and re-reduction of the oxidized Fe protein and the dissociation of MgADP from the MoFe protein. Finally, the electrons are believed to be transferred from the P-cluster to the FeMoco, where substrate reduction occurs. FeMoco-deficient, but P-cluster containing MoFe proteins have proved to be useful for the study of two major aspects of the nitrogenase research, the maturation of MoFe protein (7Robinson A.C.

Shah V.K. Biofactors. 1988; 1: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar). This maturation process most likely occurs in a series of steps. Initially the FeMoco site is inaccessible to FeMoco insertion (7Robinson A.C. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14327-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Robinson A.C.

Chem. 1991; 266: 10654-10657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The conversion to another form with the FeMoco site accessible for FeMoco insertion involves at least the Fe protein, GroEL, MgATP, and γ (9Tal S. Chun T.W. Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 98: 5521-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All required components for this conversion are availablein vivo in nifB deletion strains. Therefore, this step has already occurred and the FeMoco-deficient MoFe protein that accumulates in this strain (ΔnifB MoFe protein) has the FeMoco site in an open conformation and can be directly activated with isolated FeMoco (9Tal S. Chun T.W. Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10654-10657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the conversion to an accessible FeMoco binding site cannot occur in the absence of Fe protein, which is the case in the nifH deletion strain. Consequently, MoFe proteins produced by nifH deletion strains (ΔnifH MoFe protein) of A. vinelandii, such as DJ54, have the FeMoco site in a closed conformation (7Robinson A.C. Dean D.R. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14327-14332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Robinson A.C. Chun T.W., Li, J.-G. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

Earlier studies suggested that the ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins are different in not only the conformations of their FeMoco binding sites but also their P-cluster features (10Gavini N., Ma, L. Watt G. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The exact function and redox properties of the P-cluster have been the focus of discussion for a long time (2Burgess B.K. Lowe D.J. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 2983-3011Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Which oxidation states of the P-cluster are required in the process of electron transfer from the Fe protein to the FeMoco of the MoFe protein still remain controversial, and several possibilities have been suggested. Some favor the theory that involves two-electron oxidized POX states or at least states more oxidized than PN, the dithionite-reduced state of the P-cluster (36Peters J.W. Stowell M.H.B. Soltis S.M. Finnegan M.G. Johnson M.K. Rees D.C. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 37Lowe D.J. Fisher K. Thorneley R.N.F. Biochem.

A comparative study of the ΔnifB and ΔnifH MoFe proteins can be used to address this problem as well as many other remaining questions about the function and assembly of the P-cluster. However, the instability of these FeMoco-deficient MoFe proteins and the loss of protein activity during the time-consuming purification procedure prevented reasonable protein yields for subsequent experiments. Recently, an efficient one step purification of a His-tag version of the ΔnifB MoFe protein has been reported that allowed the isolation of a sufficient amount of protein for further studies (21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Here we report a detailed catalytic and biophysical characterization of ΔnifH MoFe protein using the same expression and purification strategies for this mutant protein. Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals and reagents were obtained from Fisher, Baxter Scientific, or Sigma. A. vinelandiiΔnifH mutant strain DJ1165, expressing a FeMoco-deficient His-tag MoFe protein (ΔnifH MoFe protein), was constructed by transforming competent cells of A. vinelandii DJ1141 with plasmid pDB115, which contained the nifH gene with a deletion within its coding sequence. The successful transformation ofA. vinelandii strain DJ1141 by pDB115 was confirmed by the inability of the transformed cells to grow without a source for nitrogen fixation. The resulting A. vinelandii DJ1165 contains an in-frame deletion within the nifH gene, extending from codon 158 to 200. The construction of plasmid pDB115 (38Jacobson M.R. Cash V.L. Weiss M.C.

The FeMoco-deficient His-tag MoFe protein expressed byA. vinelandii DJ1143 is designated as ΔnifBMoFe protein, and the construction of A. vinelandii DJ1143 has been reported in details previously (21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A. vinelandii mutant strains DJ1165, DJ1143, CA12 (ΔnifHDK), and wild type were grown in 180-liter batches in a 200-liter New Brunswick fermentor on Burke's minimal medium supplemented with 2 mm ammonium acetate. The growth rate was measured by cell density at 436 nm using a Spectronic 20 Genesys (Spectronic Instruments, Rochester, NY). After the consumption of the ammonia, the cells were de-repressed for 3 h followed by harvesting using a flow-through centrifugal harvester (Cepa). The cell paste was washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and kept on dry ice until needed. Published methods were used for the purification of wild-type Fe protein (39Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol.

All spectroscopic samples were prepared in a vacuum atmosphere dry box with an oxygen level of less than 4 ppm. Unless noted otherwise, all samples were in 25 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm Na2S2O4. MoFe protein samples were oxidized by the addition of excess of indigo disulfonate (IDS) and incubated for 30 min. Subsequently, indigo disulfonate was removed by a single passage over an anion-exchange column as described elsewhere (41Bursey E.H. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29678-29685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Ti(III) citrate and the Ti(III) citrate-reduced samples were prepared according to published methods (42Angove H.C. Yoo S.J. Burgess B.K. Münck E. J. Am. Chem.

Samples were either used as they were or they were concentrated in a Centricon-30 (Amicon) concentrator in anaerobic centrifuge tubes outside the dry box. For UV-visible absorption experiments samples were prepared in anaerobic cuvettes that were previously blanked. Spectra were recorded on an HP 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. All perpendicular and parallel mode EPR spectra were recorded using a Bruker ESP 300 Ez spectrophotometer interfaced with an Oxford Instruments ESR-9002 liquid helium continuous flow cryostat. All spectra were recorded at 10 K using a microwave power of 50 mW, a gain of 5 × 104, a modulation frequency of 100 kHz, and a modulation amplitude of 5 G. The microwave frequencies of 9.62 and 9.39 GHz were used for the perpendicular (10 scans)- and parallel (20 scans)-mode EPR spectra, respectively. All nitrogenase activity assays (8.7-ml vials) were carried out as described previously (40Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The products H2 and C2H4 were analyzed as published elsewhere (44Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ammonium was determined by a high performance liquid chromatography fluorescence method (45Corbin J.L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1984; 47: 1027-1030Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphate was analyzed as described elsewhere (46Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1952; 66: 325-400Google Scholar). Molybdenum (47Clark L.J. Axley J.H. Anal. Biochem. 1955; 27: 2000Google Scholar) and iron (48Van de Bogart M. Beinert H. Anal. Biochem. 1967; 20: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) were determined as published elsewhere. The iron-chelating assays were performed as described elsewhere (43Angove H.C. Yoo S.J. Münck E. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26330-26337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) using a Fe protein concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. The assays designed to reconstitute pure ΔnifH MoFe protein contained 25 mmTris·HCl (pH 8.0), 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.85 mm ATP, 1.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 11 units of creatine kinase, 20 mm Na2S2O4, 1.5 mg wild-type Fe protein, 1 mg of pure ΔnifH MoFe protein, and up to 50 mg of crude extract of A. vinelandii CA12 (nifHDK) in a 1.0-ml total volume. The insertion was started by the addition of isolated FeMoco inN-methylformamide. The samples were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the enzyme activity of 0.1 ml of the insertion mixture was subsequently determined as described previously (40Burgess B.K. Jacobs D.B. Stiefel E.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 614: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The product of each assay was then analyzed as published elsewhere (44Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21179-21186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using the previously described method (21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), up to 200 mg of His-tag ΔnifH MoFe protein/200 g of cells of A. vinelandii DJ1165 was purified after one step. This is a 10-fold yield increase compared with that of the conventional purification procedure (10Gavini N., Ma, L. Watt G. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was essential for subsequent extensive catalytic and biophysical characterization of this protein. Fig. 1 shows that the purified His-tag ΔnifH MoFe is an α2β2tetramer, as was described of the non-His-tag version of the ΔnifH MoFe protein from the A. vinelandiistrain DJ54 (10Gavini N., Ma, L. Watt G. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). It has been reported that FeMoco-deficient MoFe protein in DJ54 crude extracts ran well above the position of wild-type MoFe protein on native gels. This was interpreted as a result of loose association of this mutant protein with another protein that was subsequently lost during the long purification procedure (9Tal S. Chun T.W. Gavini N. Burgess B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10654-10657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Gavini N., Ma, L. Watt G. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, even with our fast purification procedure, we were not able to detect any protein, which was associated with the purified His-tag ΔnifH MoFe protein (Fig. 1, lane 6). It is worth mentioning that there is a significant difference between the subunit composition of the His-tag and non-His-tag versions of the ΔnifB MoFe proteins of A. vinelandii. In contrast to the α2β2γ2hexamer of ΔnifB MoFe protein of A. vinelandiiUW45 (16Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 3515-3522Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the α2β2 tetrameric His-tag ΔnifB MoFe protein of A. vinelandii DJ1143 does not contain an additional γ subunit (Ref. 21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar and Fig. 1, lane 4). Interestingly, although γ, not regulated by nifgenes, is believed to mediate the insertion of the FeMoco into the FeMoco-deficient MoFe protein (15Homer M.J. Dean D.R. Roberts G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24745-24752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the His-tag ΔnifB MoFe protein was found to be almost fully reconstituted after the addition of isolated FeMoco in N-methylformamide and was therefore considered catalytically active (21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The ΔnifBMoFe protein produced by Klebsiella pneumoniae also exists as an α2β2γ2 hexamer (12Hawkes T.R. Smith B.E. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 13Homer M.J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 24007-24016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the additional γ subunit of this organism has been identified as the nifY gene product (13Homer M.J. Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4907-4910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14White T.C. Harris G.S. Orme-Johnson W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24007-24016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein NifY is also present in A. vinelandii, although it was known to be different from γ. Both NifY and γ are expressed at very low levels in A. vinelandii (21Christiansen J. Goodwin P.J. Lanzilotta W.N. Seefeldt L.C. Dean D.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A large quantity purification and characterization of NifY and γ will be required to address the remaining questions about the exact function of γ and protein interactions involving γ during nitrogenase biosynthesis. TableI shows that isolated His-tag ΔnifH MoFe protein contains 18.6 mol of Fe/mol of protein and no detectable molybdenum. The analysis of isolated His-tag ΔnifB MoFe protein reveals a metal content almost identical to that of His-tag ΔnifH MoFe. The iron content of both mutant proteins, which is around 60% that of wild-type MoFe protein, and the absence of molybdenum in both matches previously described results of presumably P-cluster-containing but FeMoco-deficient MoFe proteins (10Gavini N., Ma, L. Watt G. Burgess B.K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Paustian T.D. Shah V.K. Roberts G.P.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12611-12623Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The FeMoco deficiency of His-tag ΔnifH and ΔnifB MoFe protein is confirmed by the absence of the well characterized S = 3/2 EPR signal, which arises from the FeMoco center of wild-type MoFe protein (Fig. 2, trace 1).Table IMetal contents of purified MoFe proteinsMetalMoFe proteinWild typeΔnifBΔnifH mol metal/mol protein% mol metal/mol protein% mol metal/mol protein%Mo2.2 ± 0.2100>0.1>0.1Fe32.0 ± 1.510018.1 ± 1.95718.6 ± 2.258 Open table in a new tab Despite the presumably identical cofactor content, ΔnifHMoFe and ΔnifB MoFe protein are clearly distinguishable by color.

Activation of the enzyme is achieved by binding of NO to the prosthetic heme group of the enzyme and the initiation of conformational changes. So far, the rate of NO dissociation of the purified enzyme has only been determined spectrophotometrically, whereas the respective deactivation,i.e. the decline in enzymatic activity, has only been determined in cytosolic fractions and intact cells. Here, we report on the deactivation of purified NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase determined after addition of the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin or dilution. The deactivation rate corresponded to a half-life of the NO/guanylyl cyclase complex of ∼4 s, which is in good agreement with the spectrophotometrically measured NO dissociation rate of the enzyme. The deactivation rate of the enzyme determined in platelets yielded a much shorter half-life indicating either partial damage of the enzyme during the purification procedure or the existence of endogenous deactivation accelerating factors. YC-1, a component causing sensitization of guanylyl cyclase toward NO, inhibited deactivation of guanylyl cyclase, resulting in an extremely prolonged half-life of the NO/guanylyl cyclase complex of more than 10 min. The deactivation of an ATP-utilizing guanylyl cyclase mutant was almost unaffected by YC-1, indicating the existence of a special structure within the catalytic domain required for YC-1 binding or for the transduction of the YC-1 effect. In contrast to the wild type enzyme, YC-1 did not increase NO sensitivity of this mutant, clearly establishing inhibition of deactivation as the underlying mechanism of the NO sensitizer YC-1.

Murad F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1987; 39: 163-196PubMed Google Scholar, 2Moncada S. Rees D.D. Schulz R. Palmer R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cirino G. Casini A. Napoli C. J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 1999; 34: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Most of the effects of NO are mediated by the stimulation of the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC),1 the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of cGMP. The subsequent increase in cGMP leads to the activation of cGMP effector proteins like cGMP-activated protein kinases, cGMP-gated Ca2+ channels and cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases. NO-sensitive GC is a heterodimeric enzyme consisting of an α and β subunit (5Koesling D. Friebe A. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 41-65Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although four enzyme subunits (α1, α2, β1, β2) have been identified so far, only the α1β1 and α2β1 heterodimers have been shown to exist as catalytically active NO sensitive isoforms in vivo (6Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits contains the homologous cyclase catalytic domain. With two different cyclase catalytic domains the GTP-converting catalytic region of GC appears to be related to the ATP-converting catalytic region of the adenylyl cyclase (AC). The crystal structure of the catalytic center of AC has been resolved (7Zhang G. Liu Y. Ruoho A.E. Hurley J.H. Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Tesmer J.J. Sunahara R.K. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1907-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In AC, the homologous cyclase catalytic domains C1 and C2 corresponding to the α and β subunits of NO-sensitive GC, respectively, are arranged in a “head-to-tail”-like orientation with two pseudosymmetric regions within the interface between the C2 and C1 domains. One of these regions comprises the binding site for the substrate ATP. The other region, which has probably evolved from a former ATP binding site, binds forskolin, the activator of ACs. The NO-sensitive GC contains one prosthetic heme group that acts as the acceptor site for NO (9Craven P.A. DeRubertis F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 8433-8443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ignarro L.J. Wood K.S. Wolin M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The heme group reveals an absorption maximum at 430 nm, the Soret band, indicative of a five-coordinated ferrous heme with a histidine as the axial ligand at the fifth coordinating position. NO binds to the sixth coordination position of the heme iron and leads to the rupture of the histidine-to-iron bond yielding a five-coordinated nitrosyl-heme complex with an absorbance maximum at 398 nm. The opening of the histidine-to-iron bond probably initiates a conformational change resulting in up to 200-fold activation of the enzyme. This mechanism of activation is supported by the finding that protoporphyrin IX, the iron-free precursor of heme, stimulates GC independently of NO (10Ignarro L.J. Wood K.S. Wolin M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2870-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Conceivably, protoporphyrin IX, a heme lacking iron, mimics the structure of the NO-heme complex in which the iron is moved out of the plane of the porphyrin ring. On the other hand, breakage of the histidine-to-iron bond is required but does not appear to be sufficient for activation, as a mutant without the proximal histidine and, accordingly, without the histidine-to-iron bond did not show an increased catalytic rate (13Foerster J. Harteneck C. Malkewitz J. Schultz G. Koesling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 240: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Apart from NO, the substance YC-1 has been shown to activate GC ∼10-fold and to sensitize the enzyme toward NO and CO (14Friebe A. Schultz G. Koesling D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6863-6868Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Inhibition of NO dissociation has been proposed as the underlying mechanism of sensitization (15Friebe A. Koesling D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Whereas a relatively precise concept about the NO-mediated activation of GC exists, little is known about the deactivation of the enzyme. Apparently, the rate of NO dissociation from the heme moiety is one of the fundamental parameters for deactivation of the enzyme in biological systems. From other hemoproteins, it is known that NO dissociation from heme moieties is in general rather slow in the range of minutes or even hours, which in the case of GC would raise the problem of a slow deactivation of the enzyme within a signal transduction cascade. The NO dissociation rate of GC has been determined spectrophotometrically after the addition of the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin (oxyHb). Our analysis of the NO dissociation rate of the purified enzyme yielded a half-life of the NO-GC complex of ∼2 min (16Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar); within the same experimental setting, the substrate MgGTP accelerated NO dissociation to a half-life of ∼5 s (17Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A different spectrophotometric study showed a dissociation rate corresponding to a half-life of ∼3 min but no increase in the NO dissociation rate upon the addition of MgGTP (18Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In addition to the spectrophotometrically determined NO dissociation, the decline of NO-stimulated cGMP-forming activity has been monitored after the addition of an NO scavenger, which is referred to as the deactivation of NO-sensitive GC throughout the manuscript. Margulis and Sitaramayya (19Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) reported a deactivation half-life of GC in cytosolic preparations after NO removal of ∼4 s at 37 °C. On the other hand, an in vivo study performed in intact cerebellar cells showed a very fast deactivation with a half-life of 0.2 s upon addition of the NO scavenger hemoglobin (20Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 9: 4287-4292Google Scholar). In this study, we determined the deactivation rate of the NO-sensitive GC by monitoring enzymatic activity after removal of NO. The rate of deactivation of the purified enzyme corresponded to a half-life of the NO-GC complex of ∼4 s, which is in good agreement with the spectrophotometrically determined NO dissociation rate. YC-1, a substance known to sensitize GC toward NO, slowed down deactivation of GC dramatically (120-fold) resulting in a half-life of ∼10 min. In contrast, deactivation of an ATP-utilizing GC mutant was unaffected by YC-1. The NO sensitivity of the mutant was not altered by YC-1 emphasizing the concept of an inhibition of NO dissociation as the underlying mechanism of YC-1-induced sensitization of GC. Site-directed mutagenesis of the respective amino acids in the α1 and β1 subunits (α1R594Q, β1E473K, β1C541D) was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) using the instructions of the manufacturer. The sequences of both subunits of the cAMP-forming mutant were verified by sequencing. GC was purified from the bovine lung as described (11Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.D. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Schultz G. Bohme E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of the ATP-utilizing mutant from Sf9 cells was performed as described previously (6Russwurm M. Behrends S. Harteneck C. Koesling D. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (21Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Oxyhemoglobin was prepared from bovine methemoglobin dissolved in 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4, by reduction with sodium dithionite. Subsequently, the reduced hemoglobin was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences), and the concentration of oxyhemoglobin was determined photometrically. Purified GC (7–11 μg) was preincubated with DEA-NO (50 μm, Alexis) for 3 min at 37 °C in 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mmglutathione, and 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4. After 2 min 45 s, a minute amount of GTP (40–50 nmol) with MgCl2 (400 nmol) or MnCl2 (250 nmol) was added to ensure maximal catalytic rates at the start of the deactivation. The amount of nucleotide applied was adjusted to the amount of enzyme used so that the substrate remaining at the start of the deactivation was less than 10% of the radioactive substrate. The deactivation was initiated by a 10- (MnCl2) or 100-fold (MgCl2) dilution of the preincubated sample with a solution containing 50 μm oxyHb and substrate mixture with 1 mmcGMP, 0.25 mm [α-32P]GTP (∼10 kBq), 3 mm MgCl2 or 3 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm glutathione, and 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4. At the time points indicated, aliquots were withdrawn, and reactions were stopped by ZnCO3 precipitation; the amount of accumulated [32P]cGMP was measured as described (22Schultz G. Bohme E. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. IV. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, Basel1984: 379-389Google Scholar). In the experiments measuring the deactivation of the WT enzyme in the presence of 200 μm YC-1 (Alexis, Lot L02905), the amount of enzyme was reduced (0.1 μg),d,l-dithiothreitol was used instead of glutathione, and the amount of GTP and MgCl2 during the preincubation was reduced (10 nmol GTP, 60 nmol MgCl2). The deactivation was initiated by a 100-fold dilution of the preincubated sample with a solution containing 50 μm oxyHb and substrate mixture with 1 mm cGMP, 0.25 mm[α-32P]GTP (∼10 kBq), 3 mmMgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm d,l-dithiothreitol, and 50 mmtriethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4. At the time points indicated, aliquots were withdrawn, and reactions were stopped by ZnCO3precipitation; the amount of accumulated [32P]cGMP was measured as described (22Schultz G. Bohme E. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. IV. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, Basel1984: 379-389Google Scholar). Deactivation of the NO-sensitive cAMP-forming mutant (2.2 μg) in the absence and presence of 200 μm YC-1 was determined the same way as for the WT enzyme except that cAMP and [α-32P]ATP were used instead of cGMP and [α-32P]GTP, respectively (7.5 nmol of ATP and 45 nmol of MgCl2 added after 2 min 45 s). For the determination of deactivation with GTP analogs GTPγS (Sigma-Aldrich) and GMP-PNP (Sigma-Aldrich) purified GC (0.075 μg) was preincubated with DEA-NO (50 μm, Alexis) for 3 min at 37 °C in 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mmglutathione, and 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4. The deactivation was initiated by a 100-fold dilution of the preincubated sample with a solution containing 50 μm oxyHb and the substrate mixture with 0.25 mm GTPγS or GMP-PNP, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm glutathione, and 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4. At 3, 6, 9, 15, 30, and 60 s, aliquots were withdrawn, and reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold ethanol to a final concentration of 67%. For determination of cGMP, radioimmunoassay was carried out as described (23Friebe A. Mullershausen F. Smolenski A. Walter U. Schultz G. Koesling D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed three times in hexaplicate under identical conditions. For measurement of restimulation, GC was preincubated with 3 μm DEA-NO in 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm glutathione, and 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4 for 1 min, 1 mm cGMP, 0.5 mm[α-32P]GTP (∼10 kBq), 3 mmMgCl2, were added at 0 s, and aliquots were withdrawn and reactions were stopped by ZnCO3 precipitation at the time points indicated. After 120 s, 10 μm oxyHb was added, and aliquots were stopped at the time points indicated. After 240 s, the enzyme was restimulated by addition of 1 mmDEA-NO, and aliquots were stopped at the time points indicated. Purified GC (2.2 μg) was preincubated with DEA-NO (5 μm) for 3 min at 37 °C in 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mm d,l-dithiothreitol, and 50 mmtriethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4. After 2 min 45 s, a minute amount of GTP (13 nmol) and MgCl2 (65 nmol) were added. The deactivation reaction was started by a 100-fold dilution of the preincubated sample with substrate mixture as described above. At the time points indicated, aliquots were withdrawn, and the amount of accumulated [32P]cGMP was determined. The deactivation experiments were performed with different enzyme preparations and yielded similar results. All data shown are means ± S.D. of 5–7 experiments performed with one enzyme preparation. As cGMP accumulation rather than the actual GC activity was measured during deactivation, actual activity was calculated by fitting the integral shown in Equation 1,accumulated_cGMP(t)=−ln(2)−1×t1/2×(maximal_activity−basal_activity)×e−ln(2)·tt1/2−1+t×basal_activityEquation 1 of an exponential decline in actual activity,actual_activity(t)=(maximal_activity−basal_activity)×e−ln(2)·tt1/2+basal_activityEquation 2 to the measured cGMP accumulation using Microsoft Excel Solver with t 12, maximal_activity, and basal_activity as variables. The decline in actual activity is shown in the figures beneath the respective cGMP accumulation curves. Enzymatic activity of the purified mutant (0.04 μg) and the wild type GC (0.08 μg) in the presence and absence of 200 μm YC-1 was determined by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 mm cAMP, 0.5 mm[α-32P]ATP (∼10 kBq) or 1 mm cGMP, 0.5 mm [α-32P]GTP (∼10 kBq), respectively, and 3 mm MgCl2, 3 mm d,l-dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm triethanolamine/HCl, pH 7.4, in a total volume of 100 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of the DEA-NO concentrations as indicated and transfer of the tubes to 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by ZnCO3 precipitation; determination of the enzyme-formed cyclic nucleotides was performed as previously described (22Schultz G. Bohme E. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. IV. Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, Basel1984: 379-389Google Scholar). YC-1 was dissolved in Me2SO; the final concentration of Me2SO in the samples did not exceed 2%, which does not affect GC activity. Results are means ± S.D. of three independent experiments performed in duplicates. 16 ml of venous blood from healthy volunteers were drawn into 4 ml of ACD (85 mm trisodium citrate, 65 mm citric acid, 100 mm glucose), and platelets were prepared as described previously (23Friebe A. Mullershausen F. Smolenski A. Walter U. Schultz G. Koesling D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and resuspended in platelet buffer (5 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.55 mm NaH2PO4, 7 mmNaHCO3, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, pH 7.4). Aliquots (90 μl) of the platelet suspension containing 1.5 × 108platelets/ml were equilibrated at 37 °C for 10 min in the presence of sildenafil and EHNA (100 μm, respectively). After equilibration, 10 μl of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) were added yielding a final concentration of 100 μm. Two seconds after addition of GSNO, 100 μl of buffer containing 100 μm GSNO (as control) or 100 μm oxyHb (for deactivation experiments), were added. Reactions were terminated by addition of 0.3 mmtrichloroacetic acid after 1, 2, and 4 s, followed by centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). Supernatants were extracted twice with 5 volumes of water-saturated diethyl ether, and the aqueous phase was dried under nitrogen at 70 °C. For determination of cGMP, radioimmunoassay was carried out as described (23Friebe A. Mullershausen F. Smolenski A. Walter U. Schultz G. Koesling D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed five times in triplicate under identical conditions. As yet, NO dissociation of purified NO-sensitive GC has only been determined by spectrophotometric analysis (16Kharitonov V.G. Sharma V.S. Magde D. Koesling D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6814-6818Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 17Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

The resulting deactivation of the enzyme assessed by the decline in enzymatic activity has only been measured in cytosolic fractions and intact cells (19Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 9: 4287-4292Google Scholar). In the present study, we have quantified the deactivation of the NO-stimulated purified enzyme (Fig.1 C) by measuring catalytic activity of the enzyme after the addition of the NO scavenger oxyHb. Briefly, GC was preincubated with DEA-NO for 3 min, the substrate GTP and oxyHb were added, and aliquots were stopped after 3, 6, 9, 15, 30, and 60 s. The results of such an experiment are presented in Fig.1; the accumulated cGMP at the different time points is shown in Fig.1 A. The graph in Fig. 1 B calculated to fit cGMP accumulation at these time points as described under “Materials and Methods” shows the decline in cGMP-forming activity over time yielding a half-life of ∼4 s. After deactivation, the enzyme could be restimulated by the addition of excess NO as shown in Fig.1 D. To rule out any inhibitory effect of oxyHb on the enzyme, we used a different experimental setting in which the preincubated NO-GC complex was diluted 100-fold to lower the DEA-NO concentration from 5 μm to 50 nm, i.e. from above to below the EC50 under the conditions applied. The resulting cGMP accumulation at different time points is shown in Fig.2 A; Fig. 2 B shows the calculated enzyme activities indicating a half-life of the GC-NO complex of ∼3 s. The appropriate control experiment for the whole set of deactivation experiments is shown in Fig. 2 C. Here, the NO-preincubated enzyme was diluted, and additional maximally activating NO was added. Maximal activity was observed already after 3 s and remained constant for the measured 60 s demonstrating that the enzyme was not affected by the dilution performed in the experiments shown in Fig. 2, A and B. More importantly, the results showed that NO-stimulated cGMP formation started without a measurable delay allowing us to monitor deactivation by measuring enzyme activity with short incubations. In spectrophotometric experiments, we have previously shown that GTP increases the NO dissociation rate by ∼50-fold. The data suggested that catalysis may have an effect on the deactivation. On the other hand, because of the heterodimeric structure of GC and the antiparallel orientation of the subunits, a second non-catalytic GTP binding site might exist and mediate the GTP effect on NO dissociation. Instead of MgGTP, GC is able to utilize MnGTP and with this substrate exhibits maximal NO-stimulated catalytic rates that are reduced to ∼50% of those determined for MgGTP. The deactivation of GC using MnGTP as substrate is shown in Fig. 3 and yielded a half-life of ∼8 s. Next, we studied the deactivation of GC in the presence of the GTP analogs GTPγS and GMP-PNP. Both analogs were quantitatively converted to cGMP as detected by cGMP radioimmunoassay; the catalytic rates being reduced to about one-third (GTPγS) and one-tenth (GMP-PNP) of the cGMP-forming rates observed for the substrate GTP. The finding that the GTP analogs could substitute for the substrate allowed us to measure the deactivation of NO-stimulated GC with GTPγS and GMP-PNP by following the decline of enzyme activity as described above. The resulting half-lives (3–4 s, not shown) determined with either GTPγS or GMP-PNP were in the range of the half-life observed for MgGTP showing that fast deactivation of GC does occur at drastically reduced cGMP-forming rates. From the crystal structure of AC, three amino acids have been shown to be responsible for nucleotide specificity, and substitution of the corresponding amino acids of GC with the respective counterparts of AC resulted in a GC conversion of ATP to cAMP (24Sunahara R.K. Beuve A. Tesmer J.J. Sprang S.R. Garbers D.L. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16332-16338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). To further elucidate a role of the catalytic center within the fast deactivation process, we studied the deactivation of the ATP-utilizing GC mutant. The ATP-utilizing GC mutant was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified to apparent homogeneity with an immunoaffinity purification procedure (11Humbert P. Niroomand F. Fischer G. Mayer B. Koesling D. Hinsch K.D. Gausepohl H. Frank R. Schultz G. Bohme E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 190: 273-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The purified enzyme showed the appropriate molecular masses of the α1 and β1 subunits on SDS gels (Fig.4 A). The ATP-utilizing mutant featured maximal NO-stimulated cAMP-forming rates comparable with those of the cGMP-forming WT enzyme. Determination of the mutant deactivation half-life yielded a value of ∼15 s (Fig. 4, B andC), which is slower than that of the WT enzyme although markedly faster than the dissociation of the WT enzyme measured spectrophotometrically in the absence of GTP. These experiments suggest that the ATP present is able to substitute for GTP in the deactivation process either by binding to the catalytic or to a putative non-catalytic site. In the experiments described above we monitored the deactivation of the purified enzyme. A much faster deactivation of the NO-stimulated GC in intact cerebellar cells with a half-life of 0.2 s has been reported (20Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 9: 4287-4292Google Scholar). Therefore we measured deactivation of the enzyme in the intact cellular environment and performed the respective deactivation experiments in human platelets. The deactivation measured was clearly faster than that of the purified enzyme; however, the method applied was not sensitive enough to allow an exact quantification of the rate of deactivation (data not shown). The GC activator YC-1 has been shown to sensitize the enzyme toward NO, and an inhibition of the deactivation has been proposed as the underlying mechanism. Therefore, we performed the deactivation experiment with the purified enzyme in the presence of YC-1. YC-1 slowed down the deactivation tremendously (120-fold) resulting in a half-life of the NO-GC complex of ∼10 min (Fig.5, A and B). Fig.5 C depicts the YC-1-induced shift of the NO concentration response curve by one order of magnitude to the left. This NO-sensitizing effect may very well be explained by the pronounced inhibition of GC deactivation by YC-1. Next, we measured the deactivation of the ATP-utilizing mutant in the presence of YC-1 to find out whether the mutant deactivation rate was slowed down by YC-1 as in the WT enzyme. Much to our surprise, the deactivation was decelerated only modestly by YC-1 (Fig.6, A and B). Because the YC-1 effect on deactivation of the mutant was almost vanished compared with the one observed in the WT enzyme, the mutant represented an ideal tool to elucidate whether the YC-1 induced sensitization of the WT enzyme toward NO occurs independently of the effect on deactivation. We obtained NO concentration response curves for the ATP-utilizing mutant in the presence and absence of YC-1. As can be seen in Fig. 6 C, the EC50 for NO of the mutant was not shifted by YC-1. These results indicate that the YC-1-induced inhibition of the deactivation accounts for the observed sensitizing effect of YC-1 in the WT enzyme. From other heme-containing proteins it is known that NO dissociation is fairly slow in the range of minutes to hours. As a much faster dissociation rate of NO from a five-coordinated ferrous hemoprotein was unimaginable, mechanisms other than simple dissociation being responsible for the deactivation of NO-sensitive GC have been proposed (25Dierks E.A. Burstyn J.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 351: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Yet, it appears that NO-sensitive GC features the fastest NO dissociation rate ever reported for ferrous hemoproteins although the reported half-lives, 5 s versus 3 min, determined spectrophotometrically for the purified enzyme varied considerably (17Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 18Brandish P.E. Buechler W. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16898-16907Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Here, we assessed NO dissociation by measuring the resulting deactivation of the enzyme; by monitoring enzymatic activity of purified NO-sensitive GC after the addition of an NO scavenger or after dilution of NO we found a half-life of ∼4 s. This is in agreement with the data obtained in our spectral study on the purified enzyme in the presence of GTP (17Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and another study performed in cytosolic fractions after the addition of oxyHb (19Margulis A. Sitaramayya A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1034-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). GTP has been shown to increase NO dissociation in spectrophotometric experiments (17Kharitonov V.G. Russwurm M. Magde D. Sharma V.S. Koesling D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GTP induced a change in resonance Raman spectrum of the NO-GC complex (26Tomita T. Ogura T. Tsuyama S. Imai Y. Kitagawa T. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10155-10160Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In principle, the increase in dissociation caused by GTP may indicate that GTP bound to the catalytic center is required for fast NO dissociation. On the other hand, MgGTP might mediate its effects on NO dissociation by a second non-catalytic MgGTP binding site. The pseudosymmetric counterpart of the catalytic site, which in AC binds forskolin, appeared as a tempting candidate for such a binding site. To find out whether the MgGTP effect on NO dissociation is mediated by the GTP-converting center or by a putative second non-catalytic site, we used a mutant with a changed substrate specificity utilizing ATP instead of GTP. The dissociation rate of this mutant yielded a half-life of ∼15 s, which is slower than the half-life of the WT enzyme. However, the difference is moderate; therefore, it cannot be decided whether ATP is able to substitute for GTP on the catalytic or the putative non-catalytic nucleotide binding site thereby accelerating NO dissociation. In a recent study, a considerably faster deactivation of NO-sensitive GC in intact cells upon the addition of oxyHb was reported with a half-life of 0.2 s (20Bellamy T.C. Garthwaite J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 9: 4287-4292Google Scholar). In our analogous experiments performed in platelets, deactivation was markedly faster than with the purified enzyme and compatible with the results obtained in granular cerebellar cells. Thus, although a possible impairment during the course of the purification of the enzyme cannot be ruled out, the differences in deactivation of the purified enzyme and of the enzyme in intact cells suggest the existence of deactivation accelerating factors in intact cells. The synthetic substance YC-1 that sensitizes GC toward NO has been suggested to affect deactivation of the enzyme (15Friebe A. Koesling D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the YC-1 effect on the deactivation of NO-sensitive GC. This new GC sensitizer led to a dramatic inhibition of the deactivation yielding a ∼120-fold prolonged half-life of the GC-NO complex. Surprisingly, the deactivation of the ATP-utilizing mutant was almost unaffected by YC-1. In a recent report, the N-terminal heme-binding region of the α subunit has been proposed to be responsible for YC-1 binding (27Stasch J.P. Becker E.M. Alonso-Alija C. Apeler H. Dembowsky K. Feurer A. Gerzer R. Minuth T. Perzborn E. Pleiss U. Schroder H. Schroeder W. Stahl E. Steinke W. Straub A. Schramm M. Nature. 2001; 410: 212-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). However, only three amino acids within the catalytic domains were changed in the YC-1-insensitive ATP-utilizing mutant. Therefore, substitution of these amino acids either prevents the transduction of the YC-1 effect or the respective amino acids in the catalytic domain are directly or indirectly involved in YC-1-binding. The fact that NO sensitivity of the ATP-utilizing mutant was unaffected by YC-1 clearly establishes the inhibition of deactivation of GC as the underlying mechanism for the YC-1-induced sensitization. In summary, the slow deactivation of NO-sensitive GC observed in the presence of YC-1 and the extremely fast deactivation of the enzyme observed in intact cells suggest that NO dissociation and the subsequent deactivation can be altered physiologically and pharmacologically. A change in the rate of deactivation of the enzyme would alter the amplitude and duration of the cGMP response induced by a given NO concentration thereby adapting the state of NO sensitivity of certain tissues to special physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Further experiments have to elucidate whether the opposite effects on the deactivation of NO-sensitive GC are mediated by a common site affecting NO dissociation from the heme group of the enzyme.

Here we report that in the rat testis, a functional cADPR Ca2+ release system is essential for the contractile response of peritubular smooth muscle cells (PSMC) to endothelin (ET). We previously showed that this potent smooth muscle agonist elicits intracellular Ca2+ release in PSMC and seminiferous tubule contraction via activation of ETA and ETB receptors. ETB-R induces the mobilization of a thapsigargin-sensitive but IP3-independent intracellular Ca2+ pool. Stimulation of permeabilized PSMC with cADPR was found to elicit large Ca2+ releases blocked by either a selective antagonist of cADPR or a RyR blocker, but not by heparin. Western blotting and confocal fluorescence microscopy indicated the specific expression of type 2 RyR in perinuclear localization. ET was found to stimulate the activity of ADP-ribosyl cyclase. Microinjection of the selective cADPR antagonist 8NH2-cADPR completely abolished subsequent stimulation of Ca2+ signaling via ETA and ETB receptors. cADPR therefore appears to have an obligatory role for ETA-R and ETB-R-mediated calcium signaling in PSMC. However, ETB-R seem to be coupled exclusively to cADPR whereas ETA-R activation may be linked to IP3 and cADPR signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1981439819,"To understand the role of creatine kinase (CK) in cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, CK-deficient mice (CK-/-) were studied in vitro and in vivo. In skinned fibers, the kinetics of caffeine-induced release of Ca2+ was markedly slowed in CK-/- mice with a partial restoration when glycolytic substrates were added. These abnormalities were almost compensated for at the cellular level: the responses of Ca2+ transient and cell shortening to an increased pacing rate from 1 Hz to 4 Hz were normal with a normal post-rest potentiation of shortening. However, the post-rest potentiation of the Ca2+ transient was absent and the cellular contractile response to isoprenaline was decreased in CK-/- mice. In vivo, echocardiographically determined cardiac function was normal at rest but the response to isoprenaline was blunted in CK-/- mice. Previously described compensatory pathways (glycolytic pathway and closer sarcoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria interactions) allow a quasi-normal SR function in isolated cells and a normal basal in vivo ventricular function, but are not sufficient to cope with a large and rapid increase in energy demand produced by beta-adrenergic stimulation. This shows the specific role of CK in excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle that cannot be compensated for by other pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2042491008,"The mechanism responsible for the toxic effects of methylmercury (MeHg), an important environmental pollutant, is poorly understood. We have identified a gene, CDC34, that confers resistance to MeHg in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by screening a yeast genomic DNA library. CDC34 encodes a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, Cdc34, which is involved in ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis. Overexpression of Cdc34 results in significant resistance to MeHg both in yeast and human cells, and it increases the cellular level of ubiquitinated proteins. The ubiquitin-conjugating activity of Cdc34 is essential for the Cdc34-mediated resistance to MeHg, and the protective effect of the overexpression of Cdc34 is depressed by inhibition of proteasome activity. Our results support the hypothesis that MeHg induces the cellular accumulation of a certain protein(s) that causes cell damage and that this protein(s) is degraded after its ubiquitination in proteasomes."

We examined agonist-dependent VPAC1 receptor signaling, phosphorylation, desensitization, and sequestration in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Agonist stimulation of cells overexpressing this receptor led to a dose-dependent increase in cAMP that peaked within 5–10 min and was completely desensitized after 20 min.

Mutt V. Nature. 1970; 225: 863-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Said S.I. Mutt V. Science. 1970; 169: 1217-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 3Dockray G.J. Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide and Related Peptides. 1st Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). The type-1 VIP (VPAC1) receptor is a member of a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), designated as class II. These receptors share a significant degree of sequence homology within the family (>50%), but are distinct from members of the larger rhodopsin/adrenergic receptor family (class I) (4Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GPCRs are membrane proteins characterized by seven transmembrane-spanning domains and are named for their functional interaction with heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). Agonist-activated GPCRs transduce extracellular signals into intracellular events through activation of G protein-regulated second messenger pathways or ion channels. Agonist activation of GPCRs also leads to the competing process whereby uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein results in attenuation, or desensitization, of signaling events (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An important process in the desensitization of GPCRs is the phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors, followed by receptor internalization and, finally, eventual recycling to the plasma membrane as competent receptors (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) contribute to desensitization of GPCRs by phosphorylating agonist-activated receptors (6Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Second messenger-dependent protein kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, can also phosphorylate GPCRs and dampen signaling; however, these processes are independent of receptor occupancy. GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation promotes subsequent binding of arrestin proteins. Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that bind GRK-phosphorylated receptors to prevent G protein coupling, thereby quenching intracellular signaling, and that target GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits for internalization/sequestration, dephosphorylation and recycling (7Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating these various processes are critical to the normal function of GPCRs.We have previously demonstrated that the secretin receptor, also a class II GPCR, is regulated differently from many class I receptors (8Walker J.K.L.

Like the β2AR (class I), phosphorylation and desensitization of the secretin receptor was promoted by GRKs (9Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K.L. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, unlike the β2AR, sequestration of secretin receptors was not increased by GRK overexpression nor was sequestration inhibited by a dominant negative (V53D) β-arrestin mutant (8Walker J.K.L.

Instead, second messenger-dependent phosphorylation was important for sequestration of the secretin receptor, whereas GRKs and β-arrestin are critical to the internalization of the β2AR (class I) (8Walker J.K.L.

Moreover, we determined that human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells express an endogenous VPAC1 receptor and used this receptor to demonstrate GRK specificity that was not evident in overexpressed systems. These findings suggest that the VPAC1 receptor is regulated by agonist-stimulated, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation, β-arrestin translocation, and dynamin-dependent receptor internalization likely via clathrin-coated pits.DISCUSSIONAlthough class II GPCRs are abundant and involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes, information on their regulation lags that known for the larger class I rhodopsin/adrenergic family of receptors. Study of GPCRs has relied on overexpressed heterologous cell systems that provide a controlled manner to investigate various aspects of receptor signal regulation. However, in some cases the overexpressed cell system may obscure molecular determinants involved in specific receptor regulation. For example, overexpression of a receptor not normally found in a specific cell type may not recapitulate receptor regulation in vivo. Similarly, receptor overexpression may alter endogenous regulatory proteins and either increase or decrease the phosphorylation of the receptor under study. Therefore, study of cell systems with endogenous receptor expression may provide the opportunity to ask specific questions not possible in the heterologous system.Using the VPAC1R, we have investigated its regulation by overexpression in HEK 293 cells and by studying an endogenously expressed receptor. Placement of the FLAG epitope at the N terminus of VPAC1R did not significantly alter receptor binding or signaling properties, providing a useful tool in the study of VPAC1 receptor regulation. Prior investigators have noted diminished agonist binding to the VPAC1 with mutation of the N terminus (25Gaudin P. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Couvineau A. Gaudin P. Maoret J.J. Rouyer-Fessard C. Nicole P. Laburthe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 246-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We placed the epitope at the amino terminus of the processed portion of the mature receptor to minimize interactions with sites important for agonist binding. The VPAC1R, like all class II receptors, is coupled to Gs and activates adenylyl cyclase, and appears to follow the paradigm of regulation established for class I GPCRs (27Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation, arrestin translocation, and consequent receptor internalization, regulates the VPAC1 receptor. By immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate agonist-dependent VPAC1 phosphor- ylation with a EC50 of 1.1 nm. Our receptor immunoprecipitation revealed a broad band of ∼70 kDa, similar to that seen by Fabre et al. (28Fabre C. el Battari A. Karamanos Y. Couvineau A. Salomon R. Laburthe M. Marvaldi J. Pichon J. Luis J. Peptides. 1993; 14: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation occurs by either GRKs or second messenger-dependent kinases. The VPAC1receptor, when overexpressed, is rather promiscuous with respect to phosphorylation. Like many GPCRs, the VPAC1 is phosphorylated and desensitized by GRKs 2, 3, and 5. However, when studied in an endogenously expressed fashion, GRKs 5 and 6, but not GRK 4, desensitize it preferentially. It is notable that, although GRK 4 can phosphorylate VPAC1 receptor, when both proteins are overexpressed, GRK 4 appears incapable of functionally desensitizing the endogenously expressed VPAC1 receptor. This is in marked contrast to the regulation of the related secretin receptor, where both GRK 4 and GRK 6 appear incapable of phosphorylating or desensitizing this receptor (9Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K.L. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, VPAC1 receptor is among the relatively few receptors that have been shown to be regulated by GRK 6 (27Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar).Phosphorylation and desensitization of the human VIP type 2 (VPAC2) receptor has been demonstrated in response to agonist (29McDonald T.P. Dinnis D.M. Morrison C.F. Harmar A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In that study the authors demonstrated that the VPAC2 receptor is desensitized and phosphorylated by a kinase sensitive to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (29McDonald T.P. Dinnis D.M. Morrison C.F. Harmar A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These authors postulated a role for GRK-dependent receptor phosphorylation; however, the role of GRKs in the phosphorylation and desensitization of the VPAC2 receptor has not been reported. In this paper we have demonstrated that each member of the GRK family can phosphorylate the VPAC1 receptor. However, overexpression of the VPAC1 receptor produced a significant amount of basal phosphorylation, and this may make studies on GRK-specific receptor phosphorylation less sensitive when tested in heterologous cell systems. HEK 293 cells possess an endogenous, and previously uncharacterized, VIP-type receptor. The presence of an endogenously expressing receptor provided a means to study the regulation of the VPAC1 receptor at lower, and consistently reproducible, levels of expression. Using RT-PCR we identified this receptor to be the VPAC1 receptor. Overexpression of GPCRs has been known to produce agonist-independent receptor phosphorylation, and this may be because of activation of mechanisms responsible for receptor regulation. Using the endogenous VPAC1 receptor, we demonstrated GRK specificity by dose-dependent GRK expression and cAMP accumulation. The novelty of our study resides in the utility of the endogenous receptor to determine GRK specificity that would not have been evident in the classical approach using immunoprecipitation of overexpressed receptors from cells overexpressing individual GRKs. Additionally, in this case, the lack of GRK inhibitors precludes studying specificity by kinase inhibition. We had attempted to show secretin receptor GRK specificity by titrating GRK expression but were not successful. In those studies any amount of receptor overexpression resulted in an inability to produce graduated GRK expression. Furthermore, the lack of an endogenous receptor precluded the determination of receptor regulation similar to that obtained here for the VIP receptor.Receptor phosphorylation causes β-arrestin translocation to many GPCRs (30Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and β-arrestin was originally characterized as a desensitization protein (31Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the role of β-arrestin in the regulation of the VPAC1 by demonstrating profound and swift translocation of β-arrestin-GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, when β-arrestin 1 or 2 were overexpressed in HEK 293 cells expressing only the endogenous receptor, either β-arrestin caused only a minor decrease in cAMP accumulation. This lack of effect on receptor signal termination is distinct from the effect of β-arrestin on GRK phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptors (22Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the role of β-arrestin in VIP receptor trafficking, as it has recently been proposed that β-arrestin serves to target GPCRs to endocytic pathways (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar).We have demonstrated a role for β-arrestin in the regulation of VPAC1 receptor regulation by co-localization of the receptor with arrestin using confocal microscopy and receptor-arrestin complex formation using immunoprecipitation. Clearly, β-arrestin forms a complex with the VPAC1 receptor and this complex is transported into the cell during receptor endocytosis. This internalization of the receptor-arrestin complex may play a role in subsequent receptor signaling and appears to be maintained for some time during endocytic vesicle trafficking.The molecular determinants for GPCR internalization include β-arrestin and dynamin, which act to promote GPCR targeting to clathrin-coated pit-dependent endocytosis (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, recent studies on the secretin receptor and the angiotensin II type 1A receptor suggest that all GPCRs may not manifest the same dependence on these components of receptor internalization (8Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S.

Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells overexpressing the VPAC1 receptor, agonist stimulation causes receptor internalization in a prompt manner. Receptor internalization appears to occur via endocytic vesicles. Internalization of the VPAC1 receptor is altered by overexpression of the dynamin GTPase-deficient mutant (K44A), but not by overexpression of the wild-type dynamin protein. This supports a dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated pit path for VPAC1 receptor internalization and supports a role for clathrin-dependent receptor trafficking that was not apparent in studies on the secretin receptor.Another significant difference between the VPAC1R and the secretin receptor is the result obtained using the dominant-negative inhibitor of dynamin. Secretin receptor internalization was not effected by overexpression of K44A dynamin. Similarly, the muscarinic (M2) and angiotensin type 1A receptors internalize in the face of overexpression of this impaired dynamin protein. This finding has been used to support the hypothesis that certain GPCRs may use a dynamin-independent mechanism for receptor trafficking. However, our data on VPAC1R internalization support a recent observation on the muscarinic and angiotensin type 1A receptors that, under appropriate conditions, the M2 and angiotensin type 1A receptors sequester in a dynamin-dependent manner and, once activated, these GPCRs are targeted to clathrin-coated pits that are pinched off at the plasma membrane by dynamin (32Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).The VPAC1 receptor, as a member of a distinct class of GPCRs, is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by specific GRKs and internalized via clathrin-coated pits. Unlike the secretin receptor and many other GPCRs, the VPAC1 receptor is phosphorylated and desensitized by GRK 6, information that would not have been clear by limited study in the overexpressed cell system. The utility of an endogenously expressing receptor provides a novel mechanism to pursue information on GPCR regulation. Study of endogenously expressing proteins is likely to yield results that more closely recapitulate regulation in vivo. Therefore, it appears VPAC1 receptor regulation follows a paradigm similar to that of the superfamily of class I GPCRs. The neuromodulator vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)1 is a potent vasodilator and has been shown to participate in regulating gastrointestinal motility, enzyme secretion, and blood flow (1Said S.I. Mutt V. Nature. 1970; 225: 863-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 2Said S.I. Mutt V. Science. 1970; 169: 1217-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar, 3Dockray G.J. Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide and Related Peptides. 1st Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). The type-1 VIP (VPAC1) receptor is a member of a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), designated as class II. These receptors share a significant degree of sequence homology within the family (>50%), but are distinct from members of the larger rhodopsin/adrenergic receptor family (class I) (4Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 131-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). GPCRs are membrane proteins characterized by seven transmembrane-spanning domains and are named for their functional interaction with heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins). Agonist-activated GPCRs transduce extracellular signals into intracellular events through activation of G protein-regulated second messenger pathways or ion channels. Agonist activation of GPCRs also leads to the competing process whereby uncoupling of the receptor from its G protein results in attenuation, or desensitization, of signaling events (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). An important process in the desensitization of GPCRs is the phosphorylation of agonist-occupied receptors, followed by receptor internalization and, finally, eventual recycling to the plasma membrane as competent receptors (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) contribute to desensitization of GPCRs by phosphorylating agonist-activated receptors (6Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 319-351PubMed Google Scholar). Second messenger-dependent protein kinases, such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, can also phosphorylate GPCRs and dampen signaling; however, these processes are independent of receptor occupancy. GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation promotes subsequent binding of arrestin proteins. Arrestins are cytosolic proteins that bind GRK-phosphorylated receptors to prevent G protein coupling, thereby quenching intracellular signaling, and that target GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits for internalization/sequestration, dephosphorylation and recycling (7Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 42: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating these various processes are critical to the normal function of GPCRs. We have previously demonstrated that the secretin receptor, also a class II GPCR, is regulated differently from many class I receptors (8Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,9Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K.L. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Like the β2AR (class I), phosphorylation and desensitization of the secretin receptor was promoted by GRKs (9Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K.L. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar); however, unlike the β2AR, sequestration of secretin receptors was not increased by GRK overexpression nor was sequestration inhibited by a dominant negative (V53D) β-arrestin mutant (8Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Instead, second messenger-dependent phosphorylation was important for sequestration of the secretin receptor, whereas GRKs and β-arrestin are critical to the internalization of the β2AR (class I) (8Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Ferguson S.S. Downey 3rd, W.E. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In this paper we probe the roles of receptor phosphorylation by GRKs and β-arrestin recruitment in the regulation of VPAC1receptor signaling, desensitization, and sequestration. Moreover, we determined that human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells express an endogenous VPAC1 receptor and used this receptor to demonstrate GRK specificity that was not evident in overexpressed systems. These findings suggest that the VPAC1 receptor is regulated by agonist-stimulated, GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation, β-arrestin translocation, and dynamin-dependent receptor internalization likely via clathrin-coated pits. DISCUSSIONAlthough class II GPCRs are abundant and involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological processes, information on their regulation lags that known for the larger class I rhodopsin/adrenergic family of receptors. Study of GPCRs has relied on overexpressed heterologous cell systems that provide a controlled manner to investigate various aspects of receptor signal regulation. However, in some cases the overexpressed cell system may obscure molecular determinants involved in specific receptor regulation. For example, overexpression of a receptor not normally found in a specific cell type may not recapitulate receptor regulation in vivo. Similarly, receptor overexpression may alter endogenous regulatory proteins and either increase or decrease the phosphorylation of the receptor under study. Therefore, study of cell systems with endogenous receptor expression may provide the opportunity to ask specific questions not possible in the heterologous system.Using the VPAC1R, we have investigated its regulation by overexpression in HEK 293 cells and by studying an endogenously expressed receptor.

The VPAC1R, like all class II receptors, is coupled to Gs and activates adenylyl cyclase, and appears to follow the paradigm of regulation established for class I GPCRs (27Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). In this paper we demonstrate that agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation, arrestin translocation, and consequent receptor internalization, regulates the VPAC1 receptor. By immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate agonist-dependent VPAC1 phosphor- ylation with a EC50 of 1.1 nm. Our receptor immunoprecipitation revealed a broad band of ∼70 kDa, similar to that seen by Fabre et al. (28Fabre C. el Battari A. Karamanos Y. Couvineau A. Salomon R. Laburthe M. Marvaldi J. Pichon J. Luis J. Peptides. 1993; 14: 483-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation occurs by either GRKs or second messenger-dependent kinases. The VPAC1receptor, when overexpressed, is rather promiscuous with respect to phosphorylation. Like many GPCRs, the VPAC1 is phosphorylated and desensitized by GRKs 2, 3, and 5. However, when studied in an endogenously expressed fashion, GRKs 5 and 6, but not GRK 4, desensitize it preferentially. It is notable that, although GRK 4 can phosphorylate VPAC1 receptor, when both proteins are overexpressed, GRK 4 appears incapable of functionally desensitizing the endogenously expressed VPAC1 receptor. This is in marked contrast to the regulation of the related secretin receptor, where both GRK 4 and GRK 6 appear incapable of phosphorylating or desensitizing this receptor (9Shetzline M.A. Premont R.T. Walker J.K.L. Vigna S.R. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6756-6762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Thus, VPAC1 receptor is among the relatively few receptors that have been shown to be regulated by GRK 6 (27Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1059) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and desensitization of the human VIP type 2 (VPAC2) receptor has been demonstrated in response to agonist (29McDonald T.P. Dinnis D.M. Morrison C.F. Harmar A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In that study the authors demonstrated that the VPAC2 receptor is desensitized and phosphorylated by a kinase sensitive to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide (29McDonald T.P. Dinnis D.M. Morrison C.F. Harmar A.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 64-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These authors postulated a role for GRK-dependent receptor phosphorylation; however, the role of GRKs in the phosphorylation and desensitization of the VPAC2 receptor has not been reported. In this paper we have demonstrated that each member of the GRK family can phosphorylate the VPAC1 receptor. However, overexpression of the VPAC1 receptor produced a significant amount of basal phosphorylation, and this may make studies on GRK-specific receptor phosphorylation less sensitive when tested in heterologous cell systems. HEK 293 cells possess an endogenous, and previously uncharacterized, VIP-type receptor. The presence of an endogenously expressing receptor provided a means to study the regulation of the VPAC1 receptor at lower, and consistently reproducible, levels of expression. Using RT-PCR we identified this receptor to be the VPAC1 receptor. Overexpression of GPCRs has been known to produce agonist-independent receptor phosphorylation, and this may be because of activation of mechanisms responsible for receptor regulation. Using the endogenous VPAC1 receptor, we demonstrated GRK specificity by dose-dependent GRK expression and cAMP accumulation. The novelty of our study resides in the utility of the endogenous receptor to determine GRK specificity that would not have been evident in the classical approach using immunoprecipitation of overexpressed receptors from cells overexpressing individual GRKs. Additionally, in this case, the lack of GRK inhibitors precludes studying specificity by kinase inhibition. We had attempted to show secretin receptor GRK specificity by titrating GRK expression but were not successful. In those studies any amount of receptor overexpression resulted in an inability to produce graduated GRK expression. Furthermore, the lack of an endogenous receptor precluded the determination of receptor regulation similar to that obtained here for the VIP receptor. Receptor phosphorylation causes β-arrestin translocation to many GPCRs (30Zhang J. Barak L.S. Anborgh P.H. Laporte S.A. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10999-11006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and β-arrestin was originally characterized as a desensitization protein (31Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the role of β-arrestin in the regulation of the VPAC1 by demonstrating profound and swift translocation of β-arrestin-GFP from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Interestingly, when β-arrestin 1 or 2 were overexpressed in HEK 293 cells expressing only the endogenous receptor, either β-arrestin caused only a minor decrease in cAMP accumulation. This lack of effect on receptor signal termination is distinct from the effect of β-arrestin on GRK phosphorylated β2-adrenergic receptors (22Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar). This prompted us to investigate the role of β-arrestin in VIP receptor trafficking, as it has recently been proposed that β-arrestin serves to target GPCRs to endocytic pathways (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated a role for β-arrestin in the regulation of VPAC1 receptor regulation by co-localization of the receptor with arrestin using confocal microscopy and receptor-arrestin complex formation using immunoprecipitation. Clearly, β-arrestin forms a complex with the VPAC1 receptor and this complex is transported into the cell during receptor endocytosis. This internalization of the receptor-arrestin complex may play a role in subsequent receptor signaling and appears to be maintained for some time during endocytic vesicle trafficking. The molecular determinants for GPCR internalization include β-arrestin and dynamin, which act to promote GPCR targeting to clathrin-coated pit-dependent endocytosis (5Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, recent studies on the secretin receptor and the angiotensin II type 1A receptor suggest that all GPCRs may not manifest the same dependence on these components of receptor internalization (8Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S.

Lefkowitz R.J. Premont R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In HEK 293 cells overexpressing the VPAC1 receptor, agonist stimulation causes receptor internalization in a prompt manner. Receptor internalization appears to occur via endocytic vesicles. Internalization of the VPAC1 receptor is altered by overexpression of the dynamin GTPase-deficient mutant (K44A), but not by overexpression of the wild-type dynamin protein. This supports a dynamin-dependent clathrin-coated pit path for VPAC1 receptor internalization and supports a role for clathrin-dependent receptor trafficking that was not apparent in studies on the secretin receptor. Another significant difference between the VPAC1R and the secretin receptor is the result obtained using the dominant-negative inhibitor of dynamin. Secretin receptor internalization was not effected by overexpression of K44A dynamin. Similarly, the muscarinic (M2) and angiotensin type 1A receptors internalize in the face of overexpression of this impaired dynamin protein. This finding has been used to support the hypothesis that certain GPCRs may use a dynamin-independent mechanism for receptor trafficking. However, our data on VPAC1R internalization support a recent observation on the muscarinic and angiotensin type 1A receptors that, under appropriate conditions, the M2 and angiotensin type 1A receptors sequester in a dynamin-dependent manner and, once activated, these GPCRs are targeted to clathrin-coated pits that are pinched off at the plasma membrane by dynamin (32Werbonat Y. Kleutges N. Jakobs K.H. van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21969-21974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The VPAC1 receptor, as a member of a distinct class of GPCRs, is phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner by specific GRKs and internalized via clathrin-coated pits. Unlike the secretin receptor and many other GPCRs, the VPAC1 receptor is phosphorylated and desensitized by GRK 6, information that would not have been clear by limited study in the overexpressed cell system. The utility of an endogenously expressing receptor provides a novel mechanism to pursue information on GPCR regulation. Study of endogenously expressing proteins is likely to yield results that more closely recapitulate regulation in vivo. Therefore, it appears VPAC1 receptor regulation follows a paradigm similar to that of the superfamily of class I GPCRs.

However, the mechanisms for these effects are not well understood. Therefore, cell culture experiments with BEAS-2B human airway epithelial cells were conducted to test the hypothesis that exposure to non-cytotoxic levels of Ni3S2 induces expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8). Exposure to Ni3S2 for 48 h was required to significantly increase IL-8 protein levels. Transcriptional stimulation of IL-8 mRNA levels preceded the increase in protein. Transient exposure to soluble nickel sulfate failed to increase IL-8 mRNA. Transfection with truncated IL-8 promoter constructs linked to the luciferase gene demonstrated that nickel-induced IL-8 transcription required −272 bp of the promoter relative to the transcriptional start site. A −133-bp construct, containing cytokine and hypoxia-sensitive AP-1, NF-IL6, and NF-κB sites, was insufficient for induction by nickel. Transfection with a dominant negative AP-1 construct or mutation of the AP-1, GATA, or C/EBP sites in the −272-bp IL-8 promoter construct blocked induction by nickel. Inhibiting ERK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, but not p38 kinase, diacylglycerol kinase, or hypoxia-inducible factor-1α, attenuated nickel induction of IL-8.

At the cellular level, nickel stimulates signaling cascades in airway epithelium that increase expression of the profibrotic gene, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and genes involved in hypoxic responses (3Andrew A.S.

These genes may contribute to the fibrotic process and may be common to the variety of pulmonary diseases elicited by nickel. In addition, HIF-independent pathways for nickel-induced transcription are not well described and could contribute to pleiotropic profibrotic and inflammatory effects observed in nickel-related lung diseases. The CXC chemokine interleukin 8 (IL-8) is markedly up-regulated in pulmonary fibrosis (6Keane M.P. Arenberg D.A. Lynch J.P. Whyte R.I. Iannettoni M.D. Burdick M.D. Wilke C.A. Morris S.B. Glass M.C.

Although this suggests that IL-8 expression is sensitive to nickel exposure, enhanced IL-8 mRNA and protein levels were not detected in human airway cells exposed to soluble nickel sulfate for 2 h (14Carter J.D.

In addition to potential cell-type-specific responses to nickel, different nickel species vary greatly in their kinetics and toxicity (2Kelleher P. Pacheco K. Newman L.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Oller A.R. Costa M. Oberdorster G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The lung rapidly clears water-soluble nickel salts, but insoluble particulate forms of nickel can be retained with biological half-lives of up to 3 years (2Kelleher P. Pacheco K. Newman L.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Particulate Ni3S2 is one of the most toxic nickel species with respect to fibrosis and carcinogenesis (15Oller A.R. Costa M. Oberdorster G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), yet little is known of its effects on cytokine release. The IL-8 promoter is found between −1481 and +44 bp of the transcriptional start site and contains multiple potential regulatory transcription factor binding sites, including glucocorticoids receptor, AP-1, AP-3, C/EBP, octamer motif binding proteins, NF-IL6, and NF-κB (11Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Jaffe H.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19611-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc.

Cytokine and inflammatory mediators, such as TNF, IL-1, or endotoxin, require a minimal promoter region of −130 bp, which contains essential AP-1, NF-IL6, and NF-κB sites, to fully stimulate transcription (16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Glucocorticoids and octamer binding proteins suppress IL-8 by either binding to their own DNA cis elements or preventing the binding of NF-κB (18Mukaida N. Morita M. Ishikawa Y. Rice N. Okamoto S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The portions of the IL-8 promoter required for induction by nickel have not been previously investigated. Ni3S2, in contrast to soluble nickel, could be retained in lung cells for a sufficient time to exacerbate the development of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in exposed individuals (15Oller A.R. Costa M. Oberdorster G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The current experiments were designed to examine the time course for IL-8 expression by human airway epithelial cells exposed to Ni3S2, and to determine whether this expression required retention of the particles by the cells. The results indicate that Ni3S2 causes prolonged transcriptional activation of the IL-8 gene by stimulating cell signaling cascades. In contrast, short exposures to soluble nickel do not induce IL-8 expression. Activation of the IL-8 gene by nickel is unique in that it does not require elements in the proximal promoter that are stimulated by other inflammatory mediators. Human bronchial epithelial cells (Beas-2B, ATCC, Rockville, MD) were grown to post-confluence in 6- or 12-well plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY) on 1 mg of fibronectin, 0.33 mg of Vitrogen 100 (Collaborative Research), and 0.1 mg of BSA in 100 ml of LHC-8 medium (Biofluids), as previously described (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar, 4Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L616-L623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Andrew A.S. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 168: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The cultures were maintained in LHC-9 medium (Biofluids Inc., Rockville, MD) at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air. Respirable size particulate nickel was prepared by applying Ni3S2 particles (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) to a water column and allowing the larger particles to settle out. Particle size was measured during settling using a particle counter (Coulter Corp., Miami, FL). Particles of less than 2.5 μm in diameter were decanted, concentrated by centrifugation, and sterilized by baking at 200 °C for 18 h. This preparation gives the same quantitative and qualitative responses as a standard preparation of nickel subsulfide obtained from the Nickel Producers Environmental Research Association (a kind gift from Dr. Andrea Oller). Nickel(II) sulfate hexahydrate (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI) was used to prepare soluble nickel solutions. Previous studies demonstrated by clonogenic survival assays that addition of 2.34 μg of Ni3S2/cm2 of nickel subsulfide were not toxic to this cell model (5Andrew A.S. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 168: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This amount of Ni3S2 is roughly equivalent to 90 μm soluble NiSO4. However, direct comparisons of concentration are not possible due to the inability of Ni3S2 particles to remain in suspension above the cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (10 ng/ml) was used as a positive control to induce IL-8 expression. Kinase inhibitors (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and antioxidants (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) were added 30 min prior to adding Ni3S2. The effect of nickel on secreted IL-8 protein levels was determined using the Quantikine IL-8 Immunoassay (R&D Biosystems, Minneapolis, MN). Briefly, conditioned medium was removed from treated cells and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm to remove insoluble debris. Protease inhibitors were added, and medium was incubated at 25 °C for 1 h in microtiter wells pre-coated with antibodies specific to IL-8. Western analysis for HIF-1α protein levels was performed using a polyclonal antibody to HIF-1α (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), essentially as described previously (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA). Total cellular RNA was harvested using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed with 0.5 μg of the resulting RNA, as described previously (5Andrew A.S. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl.

Specific primers for IL-8 (forward 5′-atgacttccaagctggccgtggct; reverse 5′-tctcagccctcttcaaaaacttctc) and β-actin (forward 5′-gggacctgaccgactactc-3′; reverse 5′-gggcgatgatcttgatcttc-3) were synthesized in the Molecular Biology Core at Dartmouth. PCR products were either visualized in agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide or quantified using the double-strand DNA fluorescent dye Picogreen (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) at 430-nm emission/525-nm absorption. Densitometry was performed on ethidium bromide-stained gels using IMAGE (National Institutes of Health). IL-8 mRNA expression was normalized to the housekeeping gene β-actin by determining the ratio of the IL-8 to β-actin band density or Picogreen fluorescence. Seventy percent confluent cells were transfected with IL-8 promoter constructs, normal and dominant-negative c-Jun expression plasmids, and enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD), as previously described (3Andrew A.S.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3993-4000PubMed Google Scholar), were a kind gift from Dr. Naofumi Mukaida (Kanazawa University, Japan). The following site-directed mutants of the −272-luc IL-8 promoter plasmid were prepared by PCR: AP-1 (bp −126 to −120) from TGACTCA to TatCTCA; GATA (bp −248 to −245) from GATA to GgTA; and C/EBP (bp −246 to −233) from TAATTCACCAAATT to TAATTCtCtAAAaa. Empty cytomegalovirus, c-Jun, and TAM67 plasmids were obtained from Dr. Michael Birrer (National Institutes of Health, Rockville, MD) and EGFP-N2 plasmid was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Transfection efficiency in each well was assessed by measuring EGFP fluorescence using a fluorescent plate reader (PE Biosystems (Foster City, CA), excitation of 485 nm, emission of 508 nm). Transfection efficiency of BEAS-2B cells was estimated to be ∼20–30%. Cells were harvested in 80 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 4 mm EGTA, 15 mm MgSO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol). The lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g at 4 °C for 5 min. Luciferase activity was determined using 50 μl of supernatant and 150 μl of fresh assay buffer (25 mm glycylglycine, 15 mm potassium phosphate, 15 mm MgSO4, 4 mm EDTA, 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a Dynatech Microlite ML 2250 luminometer by injecting 50 μl of 400 μm luciferin. HIF-1α phosphorothioate antisense and sense oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Molecular Biology Core at Dartmouth according to sequences published by Caniggia et al. (23Caniggia I. Mostachfi H. Winter J. Gassmann M. Lye S.J. Kuliszewski M. Post M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 577-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 μm sense or antisense oligonucleotides prior to nickel treatment. Nickel-induced HIF protein levels were suppressed for greater than 56 h after a single dose of antisense (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar). Statistical analysis was performed on data pooled from duplicate or triplicate determinations in two to three separate experiments to yield a total n = 6. Significant differences between treatment groups and controls were determined using one-way analysis of variance. The means of groups were compared using the Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. All statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism, version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as means ± S.D. or as percentage of control. The time course for IL-8 release from untreated BEAS-2B cells was compared with cells treated with Ni3S2 to determine whether the metal can induce an inflammatory response in airway epithelial cells. Secreted protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at 24-h intervals following addition of Ni3S2. As shown in Fig.1, more than 24 h of nickel exposure was required before significant increases in IL-8 expression occurred. These data suggest that particulate nickel stimulates a latent, but prolonged inflammatory phenotypic change in the BEAS-2B cells. Previous reports indicate that nickel induces a profibrotic phenotype by stimulating transcription of specific genes (5Andrew A.S. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 168: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). To determine whether the observed increases in IL-8 protein were also due to induction of mRNA levels, total RNA was isolated from control cells or cells exposed to nickel subsulfide for up to 48 h. The data in Fig. 2 demonstrate that nickel stimulates a progressive increase in IL-8 mRNA levels, which was significantly greater than control by 24 h. These levels continued to rise between 24 and 48 h and were consistent with the time course for nickel stimulation of IL-8 protein. IL-8 can be regulated at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level depending on the cell type and inducing agent used (16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Mukaida N. Harada A. Yasumoto K. Matsushima K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 36: 773-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of nickel IL-8 message stability, cells were exposed to nickel or PMA (10 nm) for 24 h prior to the addition of the transcriptional blocker, actinomycin D (5 μg/ml). Total RNA was isolated over a 7-h period following actinomycin D addition to determine the rate of message degradation. There was no significant difference in the rate of IL-8 mRNA degradation (Fig. 3) indicating that the increased mRNA levels observed in Fig. 2 were not due to increased message stability. To determine whether nickel induces transcription of IL-8, BEAS-2B cells were transiently transfected with full-length or truncated portions of the IL-8 gene promoter linked to a luciferase reporter. The data in Fig.4A were consistent with transcriptional activation of the promoter within 48 h of exposing the cells to Ni3S2. The proximal −272 bp contained the minimal nickel-responsive region of the promoter that provided maximal stimulation of luciferase activity. This −272 bp construct was more responsive than the full-length construct, consistent with loss of potential repressive elements, as previously reported for cytokine induction of the promoter (11Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Jaffe H.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19611-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Mukaida N. Harada A. Yasumoto K. Matsushima K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 36: 773-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The construct containing −161 bp also responded to Ni3S2 with a significant increase in luciferase expression. Truncation by another 28-bp eliminated significant responses. These results differ greatly from reports defining the −133 bp construct as the minimal promoter for cytokine-induced IL-8 expression (11Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Jaffe H.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19611-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 17Mukaida N. Harada A. Yasumoto K. Matsushima K. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 36: 773-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The data in Fig.4 B demonstrated that the time course for nickel-stimulated expression of the −272 bp construct was consistent with the time course for increased endogenous IL-8 mRNA. This suggested that nickel stimulated the gene at the level of transcription. It is also important to note that the luciferase activity was progressively increased following exposure to Ni3S2. This contrasts with induction by TNF, which required only the −133-bp portion of the −272 construct (11Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Jaffe H.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19611-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1994; 56: 554-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) and declined after 24 h. PCR site-directed mutagenesis of the −272 IL-8 promoter construct was performed to determine which unique cis elements were required for induction by nickel. Of several putative cis elements, the adjacent GATA and C/EBP sites at −248 to −245 and −246 to −233, respectively, appeared to be the most relevant sites to lung inflammation and pathophysiology. Mutation of either of these sites abolished induction of luciferase activity by nickel but not by TNF (Fig. 5). Disrupting the C/EBP site enhanced control and TNF-induced activity indicating that this site may be somewhat repressive. As discussed below, mutating the AP-1 site at −126 to −120 bp reduced both basal and nickel-induced activity indicating that cooperativity between proteins binding at this site and the proximal elements may be needed for full activation of the promoter by nickel. Ni3S2 is reported to be more toxic to the lung due to its uptake into the cells and increased persistence relative to soluble forms of nickel (2Kelleher P. Pacheco K. Newman L.S. Environ. Health Perspect. 2000; 108: 685-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 15Oller A.R. Costa M. Oberdorster G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1997; 143: 152-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that uptake and sustained exposure to Ni3S2were required for inducing transcription, the effects of short exposures to Ni3S2 and soluble nickel sulfate on HIF-1α protein and IL-8 mRNA levels were compared. In this paradigm, cells were treated with either form of the metal for 30 min before the cultures were rinsed and the medium was replaced. Despite repeated rinsing, microscopic examination demonstrated that Ni3S2 particles remained associated with the cells (data not shown). After a 24-h incubation period, total protein was collected for Western analysis of HIF-1α protein levels and total RNA was collected to measure IL-8 mRNA levels. As seen in Fig.6 A, short term exposure to Ni3S2 but not nickel sulfate effectively increased HIF-1α protein levels, relative to control. Short term Ni3S2, but not NiSO4, also increased IL-8 mRNA levels (Fig. 6 B). Continuous exposure of the cells to either form of nickel over the 24-h period increased IL-8 mRNA levels; although NiSO4 was less effective (Fig. 6 B). These data indicated that prolonged exposure to nickel or slow dissolution of the particles was required for full induction of IL-8. Nickel mimics hypoxia to induce profibrotic changes in BEAS-2B cell PAI-1 expression (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar, 5Andrew A.S. Barchowsky A. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2000; 168: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Hypoxia is capable of inducing IL-8 levels, although this induction required activation of the −133-bp region of the IL-8 promoter (24Xu L. Xie K. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5822-5829PubMed Google Scholar). Nickel-induced HIF-1α levels and PAI-1 expression are attenuated by inhibiting diacylglycerol kinase (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar). Therefore, the effect of the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitor, R-59949, on nickel-induced IL-8 expression was examine to establish whether induction of PAI-1 and IL-8 share similar HIF-dependent pathways. Under conditions where nickel-induced HIF protein stabilization was completely blocked (Fig.7 A), R-59949 had little or no effect on nickel-induced IL-8 expression (Fig. 7 B). The HIF independence of transcriptional activation of IL-8 by nickel was further demonstrated by the experiments presented in Fig. 7 Cwhere luciferase activity was compared in cells transfected with the −272-luciferase construct and then stimulated with nickel in the absence or presence of a HIF-1α antisense oligonucleotide. This antisense sequence is highly effective in preventing nickel from inducing PAI-1 expression (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar). However, neither the antisense nor the sense control affected luciferase activity in nickel-treated cells (Fig. 7 C). These data confirm that IL-8 expression in nickel-exposed cells is independent of the hypoxia response, despite the fact that nickel is capable of mimicking hypoxia by increasing HIF-1α stability. In certain cell types, including pulmonary epithelial cell lines, AP-1 is essential for induction of the IL-8 promoter stimulated by IL-1, TNF-α, and human T-cell lymphotrophic virus 1 (11Nakamura H. Yoshimura K. Jaffe H.A. Crystal R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19611-19617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mukaida N. Okamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Matsushima K. J. Leukoc.

Nickel-induced transcription of PAI-1 in BEAS-2B cells also requires AP-1 activity (4Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L616-L623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the data in Fig. 5 indicate that the AP-1 site is necessary for stimulation of the IL-8 promoter by nickel. Therefore, a dominant negative AP-1 construct, TAM67, was used to test the hypothesis that AP-1 is required for transcriptional activation of IL-8 by nickel. RT-PCR for IL-8 mRNA from cells transfected with the TAM67 construct with and without nickel treatment indicated that some basal AP-1 activity is necessary for the induction of IL-8 by nickel (Fig. 8). Overexpression of c-Jun did not induce IL-8 mRNA (Fig. 8). These data and the data in Figs.4 A and 5 indicate that the AP-1 site at −126 to −120 bp of the promoter is necessary but not sufficient for induction of IL-8 by nickel. Nickel-induced transcription of PAI-1 is dependent on the activation of upstream signaling cascades (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar). The role of these pathways in mediating nickel stimulation of IL-8 is unknown. Therefore, cells were pre-treated with specific inhibitors of the ERK (U0126), PI3K (wortmannin), p38 MAPK (SB20358), or diacylglycerol kinase (R-59949) for 30 min prior to a 24-h exposure to Ni3S2. Inhibition of ERK or PI3K significantly attenuated but did not eliminate IL-8 induction by nickel (Fig.9). However, consistent with previous observations for PAI-1 induction (3Andrew A.S. Klei L.R. Barchowsky A. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: L607-L615Google Scholar), there was no effect of inhibiting p38 kinase on nickel-stimulated IL-8 expression (Fig. 9). The role of IL-8 in inflammatory responses to inhaled toxicants and lung injury has been extensively studied. In contrast, much less is known of the cellular and molecular events that regulate IL-8 expression induced by"

Biphasic (early, 10 min; and delayed, 120 min) ERK1/2 activation by H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, was observed in cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. We investigated the hypothesis that the delayed activation of ERK1/2 depends on a factor secreted by oxidative stress (FSO). The delayed activation was inhibited by calphostin C, a protein kinase C inhibitor. Conditioned medium (CM) obtained from cells stimulated with H2O2 induced rapid and monophasic ERK1/2 activation, which was not inhibited by calphostin C. In contrast, calphostin C-pretreated CM did not activate ERK1/2. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was one of the candidate FSOs activating ERK1/2. The existence of MIF in CM, the recombinant MIF-stimulated ERK1/2 rapid activation, and anti-MIF neutralizing antibody-induced inhibition of the delayed activation implied that MIF could be the FSO. Pretreatment of cardiomyocytes with a mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor did not suppress the MIF secretion, although it prevented the ERK1/2 activation by H2O2. These results indicate that MIF is secreted from cardiomyocytes as a result of oxidative stress and activates ERK1/2 through a MEK1/2-dependent mechanism, although the secretion is not regulated by ERK1/2 but by protein kinase C.

Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ERK1/2 acts as a modulator of many aspects of cellular function and is acutely stimulated by growth and differentiation factors, including oxidative stress in pathways mediated by receptor tyrosine kinase, G protein-coupled receptors, or cytokine receptors (11Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the number and nature of the mechanisms leading to activation of ERK1/2 evoked by oxidative stress, that is, redox-sensitive regulation in cardiomyocytes, are poorly understood at present. Some reports have shown that ERK1/2 is activated biphasically not only by basic fibroblast growth factor and nerve growth factor but also by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and ROS generators such as LY83583 in vascular smooth muscle cells (12Meloche S.

The mechanism of late phase activation of ERK1/2 by oxidative stress has not been well examined, although early phase activation of ERK1/2 by oxidative stress has been well studied (15Aikawa R.

One of the possible mechanisms of the late-phase activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2 is autocrine and paracrine secretion of the factors activating ERK1/2 (14Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G Liao D.F. Yan C.

Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), initially identified as a soluble factor derived from activated T lymphocytes, is a cytokine that plays a critical role in several inflammatory conditions by regulating the activation of macrophages and T cells (16David J.R.

However, after cloning of the MIF cDNA, previously unrecognized endocrine and enzymatic functions of MIF were revealed. It also acts as a proinflammatory cytokine produced by macrophages in response to a variety of inflammatory stimuli and as a factor stimulating cell growth in many cell types (18Calandra T.

The responses of cardiovascular systems to MIF have not been reported except for mRNA and protein expression of MIF in the atherosclerotic region in a hypercholesterolemic model of rabbit vessels (22Lin S.G., Yu, X.Y.

Recently, increased serum concentrations of MIF have been reported in patients with acute myocardial infarction in which reperfusion injury may be involved (23Yu C. Lau C. Lai K.W. Huang X. Chen W. Lan H.Y. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 774-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that cardiomyocytes could secrete factors increasing ERK1/2 activity in response to ROS and that MIF could be an important secreted ROS-induced factor in cardiomyocytes. To explore this hypothesis, we used cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rat to examine whether H2O2 induced MIF secretion in cardiomyocytes and to investigate the mechanism and the relationship between MIF and H2O2-induced ERK1/2 activation. Reagents for tissue culture were obtained from Invitrogen. Polyclonal antibodies against phosphospecific and total ERK1/2 and phosphospecific and total MEK1 or 1/2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). PD98059, geldanamycin, and calphostin C were purchased from Calbiochem. Rat recombinant MIF was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as described previously (24Nishihira J. Kuriyama T. Sakai M. Nishi S. Ohki S. Hikichi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1247: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A polyclonal anti-rat MIF antibody was generated by immunizing New Zealand White rabbits with recombinant rat MIF as reported previously (25Nishio Y. Mianami A. Kato H. Kaneda K. Nishihira J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1453: 74-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1–2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat ventricles by an enzymatic method as described previously (26Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Singer H.A. Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1308-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Hunt R.A. Bhat G.J. Baker K.M. Hypertension. 1999; 34: 603-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 28Fukuzawa J. Booz G.W.

Twenty-four hours after isolation, serum-containing medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 with a serum substitute as described previously (29Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Baker K.M. Hypertension. 1996; 28: 635-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours before experiments, cells were given the same medium without the serum substitute. Using these methods, cultures that contained 90–95% myocytes were obtained (26Booz G.W. Dostal D.E. Singer H.A. Baker K.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: C1308-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were lysed after each stimulation with a buffer as described previously (30Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lysed samples were subjected to Tris-glycine-SDS-PAGE (8–10%). After separation by electrophoresis, samples were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using each indicated antibody (30Bhat G.J. Thekkumkara T.J. Thomas W.G. Conrad K.M. Baker K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31443-31449Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signals were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For detection of MIF, the samples were subjected to Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE as described previously (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). In each experiment, three independent analyses were performed to confirm the reproducibility. Conditioned medium was collected and concentrated according to a method described elsewhere (14Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G Liao D.F. Yan C. Haendeler J. Suh Y.A. Lambeth J.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution (NaCl 130 mm, KCl 5 mm, CaCl2 1.5 mm, MgCl2 1 mm, HEPES 20 mm, pH 7.4) and were equilibrated for 24 h. H2O2 (1 mm) was added to the Hanks' balanced salt solution pretreated with/or without calphostin C (1 μm) or PD98059 (50 μm) or control medium from the cells unstimulated with H2O2, were collected and centrifuged to remove the debris at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The conditioned medium pretreated with or without calphostin C or PD98059 and the control medium were concentrated 100-fold by using a CentriprepTM centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The concentration (degradation) of the exogenously added H2O2 in the medium with or without cells was measured with a Bioxytech H2O2-560TM (Oxis International Inc., Portland, OR) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Exposure of cardiomyocytes to H2O2 (1 mm) stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (activation) with a peak at 10 min. The ERK1/2 activity returned to the base-line level at 45–60 min. After returning to the base line, a second peak of ERK1/2 activation appeared at 120 min (Fig.1 A). The concentration of H2O2 that was added exogenously to the medium decreased exponentially and returned to the basal (zero) level within 90 min after the exogenous administration (Fig. 1 B). Concentration dependences of H2O2 in the early and late phases of ERK1/2 activation occurred in different manners (Fig. 1 C). To evaluate whether H2O2-induced ERK1/2 activation was mediated via an ROS-dependent or -independent mechanism, cells were treated with the antioxidant reagent, catalase (3000 units/ml) before exposure to H2O2 (1 mm). Catalase inhibited both the early and late phases of ERK1/2 activation in response to H2O2 (Fig. 1 D). To assess the upstream mechanism of H2O2-induced ERK1/2 activation, cardiomyocytes were pretreated with reagents that inhibit MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), Raf-1, or protein kinase C (PKC) before exposure to H2O2. The addition of PD98059 (50 μm), an inhibitor of MEK, decreased both the early and late phases of ERK1/2 activation in response to H2O2 (Fig.2 A). The activity of MEK1/2 was also up-regulated biphasically by H2O2administration into cultured medium as was that of ERK1/2 (Fig.2 B). Geldanamycin (2 μm), which can bind to HSP-90 and disrupts the Raf-1-HSP90 multimolecular complex leading to destabilization of Raf-1 (32Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen R. Trepei J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), also inhibited both peaks (Fig.2 C). However, calphostin C (1 μm), a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, diminished only the delayed activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2 (Fig. 2 D). Conditioned medium obtained from the cells exposed to 1 mmH2O2 (CM+) stimulated ERK1/2 activation rapidly and monophasically (Fig.3 A), whereas H2O2-unstimulated control medium (CM−) did not stimulate ERK1/2 activation (Fig.3 B). The conditioned medium was fractionated on a molecular weight basis using a commercially available filter device. Adding each fraction to the medium stimulated ERK1/2 activation in cardiomyocytes. CM10–30, CM50, and CM30–50, to a lesser extent, could stimulate ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3 C). In contrast to the H2O2-stimulated cells, catalase did not inhibit ERK1/2 activation in cells stimulated with CM+ (Fig.3 D). Calphostin C-pretreated conditioned medium obtained from the cells stimulated with H2O2 (1 mm) showed suppressed ERK1/2 activation (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the conditioned medium-stimulated rapid and monophasic activation of ERK1/2 was not inhibited by pretreatment with calphostin C (1 μm) (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4Secretion of H2O2-induced factor by a calphostin C-dependent mechanism and regulation of the secreted factor-induced ERK1/2 activation by a calphostin C-independent mechanism. A, medium derived from the cultured cardiomyocytes preincubated with calphostin C (1 μm) for 30 min followed by H2O2 (1 mm) for 120 min was collected and concentrated (CMcalphostin) as described under “Materials and Methods.” The concentrated medium was applied to the cells for the indicated times. The cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-phosphospecific ERK1/2 (upper panel) and anti-ERK (lower panel) antibodies. B, 30 min after calphostin C incubation, neonatal cultured cardiomyocytes were exposed to the conditioned medium derived from cells stimulated with H2O2 (1 mm) for 120 min (CM +), and the ERK1/2 activation was assessed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MIF in the conditioned medium was detected by Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, whereas no MIF was detectable in the control medium or mock-stimulated medium (Fig.5 A). To confirm the effect of ERK1/2 on MIF secretion induced by H2O2, PD98059 (50 μm)-pretreated conditioned medium was analyzed. PD98059 did not inhibit H2O2-induced MIF secretion from cardiomyocytes. However, protein kinase C inhibition by calphostin C (1 μm) inhibited H2O2-induced MIF secretion. MIF concentration in the conditioned medium increased from 90 min after H2O2 stimulation (Fig.5 B). By contrast, MIF was not secreted in the calphostin C-pretreated conditioned medium. To determine whether the H2O2-induced MIF secretion was controlled via a regulatory or constitutive mechanism (33Sadoshima J. Izumo S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), the changes in the MIF concentration in cells stimulated with H2O2 (1 mm) were determined by using whole cell lysate. Intracellular MIF contents were decreased at 90 and 120 min after stimulation (Fig. 5 C). Cells stimulated with a high concentration of recombinant MIF showed rapid and monophasic activation of ERK1/2-like conditioned medium-stimulated cells (Fig.6 A). We also determined the effect of an anti-MIF antibody on H2O2-induced ERK activation. Anti-MIF antibody (1:1000) pretreatment inhibited the late phase activation of ERK1/2, whereas pretreatment of the cells with preimmune serum did not decrease the H2O2-induced late phase activation (Fig.6 B). In each ERK1/2 activation stimulated with the conditioned medium fractionated by the centrifugal filtration system, CM30–50-induced ERK1/2 activation was completely inhibited by the anti-MIF antibody, and the one stimulated with CM10–30 was partially inhibited (Fig. 3 C). The MAPK signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in the mediation of cellular responses to a variety of signaling molecules. ERK1/2 regulates cell growth, embryonic development, cell survival (9Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5036) Google Scholar), and cell differentiation in different cell types through the stimulation of specific gene expression. The signaling pathway for ERK1/2 activation includes intracellular calcium, heterotrimeric G proteins, protein kinase C, JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathways, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. in cardiomyocytes the Src/Ras/Raf-1 cascade has also been reported as a pathway for the redox-sensitive regulation of ERK1/2 in the early phase (15Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that exogenously supplied H2O2 (1 mm) caused biphasic activation of ERK1/2, which was inhibited by catalase, an antioxidant reagent, in cultured cardiomyocytes from neonatal rats. The mechanism of this phenomenon was inferred to be ROS-dependent. Pharmacological blockade of the Raf-1/MEK cascade activation suppressed the activation in both phases. On the other hand, inhibition of the PKC pathway by calphostin C blocked only the late-phase activation of ERK1/2 in response to H2O2. It was obvious that stimulation by regeneration of H2O2 could be excluded as a mechanism for the late phase activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2. The concentration of the exogenously applied H2O2in the medium decreased exponentially in the presence of the cells (Fig. 1 B). The phenomenon of biphasic ERK1/2 activation in various cells has already been reported. Like H2O2, basic fibroblast growth factor, nerve growth factor, and ROS generators such as LY83583 were reported to stimulate the biphasic ERK1/2 activation (12Meloche S. Seuwen K. Pages G. Pouyssegur J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 845-854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13York R.D. Yao H. Dillon T. Ellig C.L. Eckert S.P. McCleskey E.W. Stork P.J. Nature. 1998; 392: 622-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 14Jin Z.G. Melaragno M.G Liao D.F. Yan C. Haendeler J. Suh Y.A. Lambeth J.D. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The Ras/Raf/MEK cascade is known as an ERK1/2 activation system. In the present study, Raf-1 and MEK were shown to be upper signaling cascades for both phases of the ERK1/2 activation. Because geldanamycin, which was used as an inhibitor of Raf-1 in the present experiments, could function as an inhibitor of HSP-90 (32Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen R. Trepei J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), biphasic activation of ERK1/2 with H2O2 could also be explained by an HSP-90-related mechanism. Further examination will be needed to confirm whether the phenomenon is HSP-90-dependent. We have demonstrated that the late phase activation of ERK1/2 is PKC-dependent. Although PKC is also known as a Raf-1 stimulator followed by ERK1/2 activation, the early phase activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2 was not mediated through this cascade in the present experiments. This indicated that the mechanisms of H2O2-induced ERK1/2 activation were different in the early and late phases. This finding was supported by the differences in H2O2 concentration dependence of ERK1/2 activation between the early and late phases. PKC plays important roles in many cellular responses in various types of cells. These responses include contraction, migration, hypertrophy, proliferation, apoptosis, and secretion (34Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, lung surfactant phospholipid from alveolar type II cells is secreted via a conventional type PKC (PKC-α and -β)-dependent mechanism (35Linke M, J. Burton F.M. Fiedeldey D.T. Rice W.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L171-L177PubMed Google Scholar). Considering these reports, we hypothesized that the mechanism of the PKC-dependent late phase activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2 could be explained by a factor secreted by oxidative stress (FSO). To examine this hypothesis, we examined the effect of conditioned medium derived from the cells stimulated with H2O2 (1 mm) for 120 min on ERK1/2 activation in cardiomyocytes. As demonstrated in Fig. 3, concentrated control medium obtained from the cells unstimulated with H2O2 did not activate ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes. In contrast, the concentrated conditioned medium rapidly and monophasically activated the ERK1/2. These facts confirmed the hypothesis that a secreted factor plays a key role in the H2O2-induced late phase activation of ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes. Catalase, which abrogated H2O2-induced ERK activation, did not inhibit the rapid and monophasic activation of ERK1/2 induced by conditioned medium. This suggested that the mechanism of the conditioned medium-induced ERK1/2 activation was independent of ROS. The decay of H2O2 shown in Fig. 1 indicated that the mechanism of the residual H2O2 in the medium was excluded for the rapid and monophasic activation of ERK1/2 by conditioned medium. Conditioned medium pretreated with calphostin C did not activate ERK1/2 in cardiomyocytes, as demonstrated in Fig. 4. This, along with the result that the late phase activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2 was PKC-dependent, indicated that the mechanism of the oxidative stress-induced secretion was PKC-dependent. In the present study, we demonstrated that the ERK1/2 activation in conditioned medium could be fractionated into various molecular weight ranges and that each fraction induced ERK1/2 activation to some extent. This indicated that some secreted factors were responsible for the late phase activation. By means of a literature search (36Koong A.C. Denko N.C. Hudson K.M. Schindler C. Swiersz L. Koch C. Evans S. Ibrahim H., Le, Q.T. Terris D.J. Giaccia A.J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 883-887PubMed Google Scholar), we examined which growth factors or cytokines were activated by oxidative stress, including ischemia and hypoxia, and stimulated ERK1/2 activation. Considering the molecular weight, MIF could be one of the candidate molecules that activate ERK1/2. The molecular weight of MIF is 13,000; it forms oligomers, especially trimers, as confirmed by crystal structure analysis (37Sugimoto H. Suzuki M. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nishihira J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 389: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 38Sun H. Bernhagen J. Bucala R. Lolis E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1996; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and cross-linking studies (40Bendrat K., Al- Abed Y. Callaway D.J.I. Peng T. Calandra T. Metz C.N. Bucala R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15363-15370Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,41Mischke R. Kleemann R. Brunner H. Bernhagen J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It has been reported to stimulate ERK1/2 in fibroblasts via a protein kinase A-dependent pathway (42Mitchel R.A. Metz C.M. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). MIF was originally described as a T-cell-derived cytokine that inhibits macrophage migration in vitro and promotes macrophage accumulation in the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction (16David J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 56: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 17Bloom B.R. Bennett B. Science. 1966; 153: 80-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1274) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6, we observed that neutralizing antibodies against MIF partially inhibited the late phase activation of ERK1/2 by H2O2 and that recombinant MIF induced ERK1/2 activation in a manner similar to the ERK1/2 activation induced by conditioned medium. The medium fraction of CM30–50 (containing major parts of the MIF trimer)-induced ERK1/2 activation was completely inhibited and that of CM10–30 (containing a possible MIF monomer or dimer) was partially inhibited by the anti-MIF antibody. These results suggested that MIF can act as a monomer or oligomer and that some other factors, induced by H2O2 and increased ERK1/2 activation, existed in the CM10–30. These results indicated that MIF, either alone or with one or more other factors, could be the FSO. Factors secreted in response to oxidative stress mediate production of the oxidative stress-induced growth factor in several cell types (43Sano M. Fukuda K. Sato T. Kawaguchi H. Suematsu M. Matsuda S. Koyasu S. Matsui H. Yamauchi-Takihara K. Harada M. Saito Y. Ogawa S. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Although different growth factors are involved depending on the type of tissue as well as the type of oxidative stress, it is obvious that responses in an autocrine/paracrine manner could be a common mechanism utilized in oxidative stress-induced signal transduction. MIF mRNA expression in cardiomyocytes was up-regulated 6 h after H2O2 stimulation (44Takahashi M. Nishihira J. Shimpo M. Mizue Y. Ikeda U. Shimada K. Cardiovasc. Res. 2001; 52: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), and the concentration of MIF in the cardiomyocytes decreased after H2O2stimulation. It is likely that myocytes utilize the regulated type (preformed MIF within cells) but not the constitutive type of secretion for oxidative stress-induced MIF secretion, like atrial natriuretic factor secretion in response to endothelin (45Irons C.E. Sei C.A. Glembotski C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H282-H285Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that oxidative stress causes secretion of preformed MIF, although an oxidative stress-induced increase in MIF production is likely to occur at a later stage. Several possibilities could be considered for the mechanism of MIF secretion induced by oxidative stress. First, oxidative stress activates signaling pathways such as that of PKC, Ca2+, and small G protein (Rab), which may in turn stimulate growth factor secretion. The present work suggests this PKC-dependent explanation. Second, oxidative stress causes an alteration in myocyte sarcolemmal permeability, which indicates release of intracellular growth factors. Pacing-induced basic fibroblast growth factor release from adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes accounts for this mechanism (46Kaye D. Pemental D. Prasad S. Maki T. Berger H.J. McNeil P.L. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Although the plasma MIF level increases in patients with acute myocardial infarction, it does not increase in patients with other ischemic conditions such as unstable angina pectoris (23Yu C. Lau C. Lai K.W. Huang X. Chen W. Lan H.Y. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 774-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These data suggest that MIF is secreted from necrotic cardiomyocytes. Thus, these possibilities will have to be examined. Next, the question arises as to whether linkage between the early phase and late phase activation of ERK1/2 exists. PKC is known to stimulate Raf-1 followed by ERK1/2 in some types of cells (47Barrie A.P. Clohessy A.M. Buensuceso C.S. Rogers M.V. Allen J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19666-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), indicating that PKC signaling could be the upper signaling cascade for each phase of ERK1/2 activation. As shown in Fig. 4, a PKC inhibitor, calphostin C, inhibited neither conditioned medium-induced (that is, FSO-induced) ERK1/2 activation nor H2O2-induced early phase activation of ERK1/2, indicating that PKC was not the upper signaling cascade for either early or late phase ERK activation evoked by H2O2. A similar result for the early phase activation of ERK1/2 was reported previously (15Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Because we used calphostin C, known as a pan-specific PKC inhibitor, in the present study as well as in a previous one (15Aikawa R. Komuro I. Yamazaki T. Zou Y. Kudoh S. Tanaka M. Shiojima I. Hiroi Y. Yazaki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1813-1821Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), additional experiments using isotype-selective PKC inhibitor such as Go-6983 will be needed to determine which PKC isozymes contribute to the H2O2-induced MIF secretion. PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK, and geldanamycin, an inhibitor of Raf-1, had inhibitory effects on H2O2-induced ERK1/2 activation in both phases as demonstrated in Fig. 2, indicating that the Raf-1/MEK pathway was the upper signaling cascade for ERK1/2 activation in both phases. On the other hand, ERK1/2 did not play a major role in MIF secretion, which had been suggested by the finding that H2O2-stimulated conditioned medium pretreated with PD98059 did not affect the secretion of MIF from cardiomyocytes, as shown in Fig. 5. These data indicate that the early phase activation of ERK1/2 by oxidative stress is not required for the late phase activation of ERK1/2. For the secretion of MIF, PKC plays a key role. The present study indicated a novel role for MIF in the mediation of the oxidative stress-induced signaling cascade up-regulation in cardiomyocytes. In summary, we have demonstrated that oxidative stress activates ERK1/2 biphasically in cardiomyocytes. A PKC-dependent mechanism contributes to the late phase activation of ERK1/2 by oxidative stress. Secretion of MIF from cardiomyocytes themselves, induced by oxidative stress, plays a key role in late phase activation of ERK1/2 through a MEK-dependent mechanism, although its secretion is not regulated by the MEK-ERK1/2 signaling cascade but by PKC. These phenomena provide important insights into the cellular response to oxidative stress. We thank M. Yashima for excellent technical assistance and the members of the First Department of Medicine, Asahikawa Medical College, for helpful discussions."

Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and we have cloned a subgroup of this family, the class F receptor, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell (SREC), from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library (6Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). SREC mediates the binding and degradation of acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL in endothelial cells. The primary structure of the molecule has no significant homology to other types of scavenger receptors. SREC has several characteristic domain structures, including an N-terminal extracellular domain with seven epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like cysteine pattern signatures and an unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (391 amino acids) composed of a Ser/Pro-rich region followed by a Gly-rich region. SREC is expressed at high levels in endothelial cells but not in smooth muscle cells.Regulation of gene expression at the transcription level is mediated by the interaction of trans-acting factors with cis-acting DNA sequences in genes (8Manitis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of the SREC gene has not been clarified. Therefore, identification of basal and regulatory DNA elements in the 5′-flanking region of the human SREC gene will provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of this gene. In this paper, we report the isolation and functional analysis of the promoter of the human SREC gene. To examine the regulation of the human SREC gene promoter, chimeric constructs containing serial deletions of the 5′-flanking region of the human SREC gene ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were prepared and transfected into HUVEC. We have identified the region that plays an important role in determining the basal promoter activity of the gene. This region contained an inverted repeat (IR) sequence with a triple nucleotide spacer (IR-3) and Sp1 motif. Employing a one-hybrid system, we cloned a novel transcription factor, endothelial zinc finger protein-2 (EZF-2), that bound to the 5′-flanking region, IR-3 motif of the SREC gene from a HUVEC cDNA library. Co-transfection of the SREC promoter and Sp1 or EZF-2 expression plasmids in HUVEC revealed that EZF-2 but not Sp1 increased SREC promoter activity. On the other hand, the mutation of either the Sp1 motif or IR-3 motif resulted in a decrease in promoter activity. It was also found that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α inhibited SREC promoter activity. Our results suggest that whereas Sp1 is the major nuclear protein bound to the regulatory region of the SREC promoter and can regulate the gene expression, EZF-2, a novel transcription factor, is also a major regulator of the promoter activity.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized the human gene encoding SREC. The gene is ∼12 kb in length and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. Only a single SREC transcription start site was identified in cultured HUVEC using RLM-RACE. Alternatively, spliced SREC variants were identified by cloning of full-length cDNA clones from a human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. The sizes of the cDNAs were all ∼3.5 kb and could not be distinguished by Northern blot analysis. Among them, two encode soluble forms of SREC, and we have observed that SREC-2 was indeed expressed in HUVEC (data not shown). Although the expression of these alternatively spliced forms of SREC in other tissues is not known, it is conceivable that such soluble receptors may modulate the pathophysiological function of membrane-bound receptor through interaction with its ligand (22Schleiffenbaum B.

We have defined the basal promoter activity within the 5′-flanking region of the human SREC gene, a fragment extending from −108 to −98, that, when deleted, reduced the activity of a luciferase reporter construct to the background level in transient transfection assays. A consensus binding site for the transcription factor Sp1 was present 78 bp upstream of the transcription start site. Sp1, which is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues, is believed to regulate cell type-specific expression of genes such as KDR/flk-1 in HUVEC (18Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Hsieh C.M. Yoshizumi M. Lee M.E. Haber E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23111-23118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These results suggest that elements within this region, which have proximal potential binding sites for Sp1, are critical for endothelial cell-specific expression of SREC and that these elements are likely to serve as the core promoter of this TATA-less gene.To define DNA-protein interactions in this region and determine the proteins binding to the SREC promoter, we performed in vitroDNase I footprinting assays. A densely protected nucleoprotein complex was formed on the nucleotide sequence from −108 to −65 bp in the presence of HUVEC nuclear extract but not of control and CASM (Fig. 5), suggesting that this region is critical for the transcriptional regulation of the SREC gene. Furthermore, we have cloned a novel transcription factor, EZF-2, that bound to this critical region, by employing a one-hybrid system. The domain structure and the amino acid sequence of EZF-2 are similar to those of several zinc finger transcription factors such as Krüppel-like ZNF191 (26Han Z.G. Zhang Q.H., Ye, M. Kan L.X., Gu, B.W., He, K.L. Shi S.L. Zhou J., Fu, G. Mao M. Chen S.J, Yu, L. Chen Z. J. Biol.

The leucine-rich region/SCAN domain has been shown to be able to mediate homo- and hetero-oligomerization (27Sander T.L. Haas A.L. Peterson M.J. Morris J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12857-12867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The C2H2 zinc finger is composed of two short β-strands followed by an α-helix and the conserved cysteines and histidines that coordinate with a zinc ion. Since many members of the C2H2 zinc finger gene family regulate differentiation processes and genetic mutation in some zinc finger genes has been associated with specific human diseases (28Mitchell P.J. Tjijan R. Science. 1989; 245: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar, 29Evans R. Hollenberg S.M. Cell. 1988; 52: 1-3Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), it is interesting to elucidate the role of this novel transcription factor. Further work is required.Recombinant Sp1 had essentially the same binding activity as HUVEC nuclear extract (Fig. 5), suggesting that the major binding protein in HUVEC nuclear extract was attributable to Sp1. On the other hand, recombinant EZF-2 was found to bind to the sequence between −122 and −88, immediately upstream of the Sp1 binding site. Overexpression of EZF-2 increased SREC promoter activity by nearly 2.5-fold in HUVEC, while expression of Sp1 alone showed no significant effect on basal SREC promoter activity in HUVEC. On the other hand, mutation analysis of reporter constructs revealed that the intact Sp1 and IR-3 motifs were required for the maximal expression of the SREC gene. These results suggested that Sp1 and EZF-2 can induce SREC gene expression independently. It is conceivable that in the overexpression experiments, Sp1 had little effect because of the high and saturation level of endogenous Sp1 expression in HUVEC. The precise mechanism of the endothelial cell-specific expression of the SREC gene remains to be elucidated.Employing the 5′-flanking region of SREC, the regulation of SREC expression in HUVEC in vitro by various stimuli was determined at the transcriptional level. Among them, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α inhibited promoter activity. A parallel decrease in DiI-acetylated LDL uptake was observed after treatment with these stimuli (data not shown). These results suggested the possibility that cytokines regulated the expression level of SREC and thus modified the inflammatory process. Pathophysiological implications of these regulations should be elucidated by analyzing the biological function of SREC.In summary, we have characterized the human SREC gene promoter in detail and found that a novel transcription factor, EZF-2, regulated the gene expression. The gene expression was regulated by several cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1α, and IL-1β, suggesting that SREC plays a role in the course of inflammation. Since several investigators have reported that the stimulation of scavenger receptors in endothelial cells induces the expression of proteins related to vascular functions, the elucidation of the underlying mechanism for SREC gene regulation will provide new insight into the pathological function of the SREC. Scavenger receptors mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified lipoproteins, such as acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL)1 and oxidized LDL, and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The scavenger receptor gene family is composed of a series of unlinked genes that encode membrane proteins that bind multiple ligands (1Krieger M. Stern D.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 645-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 2Platt N. Gordon S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 649-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 3Herz J. Strickland D.K. J.

Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), and we have cloned a subgroup of this family, the class F receptor, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cell (SREC), from a human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) cDNA library (6Greaves D.R. Gough P.J. Gordon S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). SREC mediates the binding and degradation of acetylated LDL and oxidized LDL in endothelial cells. The primary structure of the molecule has no significant homology to other types of scavenger receptors. SREC has several characteristic domain structures, including an N-terminal extracellular domain with seven epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like cysteine pattern signatures and an unusually long C-terminal cytoplasmic domain (391 amino acids) composed of a Ser/Pro-rich region followed by a Gly-rich region. SREC is expressed at high levels in endothelial cells but not in smooth muscle cells. Regulation of gene expression at the transcription level is mediated by the interaction of trans-acting factors with cis-acting DNA sequences in genes (8Manitis T. Goodbourn S. Fischer J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1237-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of the SREC gene has not been clarified. Therefore, identification of basal and regulatory DNA elements in the 5′-flanking region of the human SREC gene will provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of this gene. In this paper, we report the isolation and functional analysis of the promoter of the human SREC gene. To examine the regulation of the human SREC gene promoter, chimeric constructs containing serial deletions of the 5′-flanking region of the human SREC gene ligated to the luciferase reporter gene were prepared and transfected into HUVEC. We have identified the region that plays an important role in determining the basal promoter activity of the gene. This region contained an inverted repeat (IR) sequence with a triple nucleotide spacer (IR-3) and Sp1 motif. Employing a one-hybrid system, we cloned a novel transcription factor, endothelial zinc finger protein-2 (EZF-2), that bound to the 5′-flanking region, IR-3 motif of the SREC gene from a HUVEC cDNA library. Co-transfection of the SREC promoter and Sp1 or EZF-2 expression plasmids in HUVEC revealed that EZF-2 but not Sp1 increased SREC promoter activity. On the other hand, the mutation of either the Sp1 motif or IR-3 motif resulted in a decrease in promoter activity. It was also found that inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α inhibited SREC promoter activity. Our results suggest that whereas Sp1 is the major nuclear protein bound to the regulatory region of the SREC promoter and can regulate the gene expression, EZF-2, a novel transcription factor, is also a major regulator of the promoter activity. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have characterized the human gene encoding SREC. The gene is ∼12 kb in length and contains 11 exons and 10 introns. Only a single SREC transcription start site was identified in cultured HUVEC using RLM-RACE. Alternatively, spliced SREC variants were identified by cloning of full-length cDNA clones from a human peripheral blood leukocyte cDNA library. The sizes of the cDNAs were all ∼3.5 kb and could not be distinguished by Northern blot analysis. Among them, two encode soluble forms of SREC, and we have observed that SREC-2 was indeed expressed in HUVEC (data not shown). Although the expression of these alternatively spliced forms of SREC in other tissues is not known, it is conceivable that such soluble receptors may modulate the pathophysiological function of membrane-bound receptor through interaction with its ligand (22Schleiffenbaum B.

https://openalex.org/W2086736525,"Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation induces various cellular responses by activating many UV-responsive enzymes including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Various G protein-coupled receptor agonists also activate MAPKs, but it is not known whether or not G proteins also mediate the UV-induced activation of MAPKs. Therefore, this study was undertaken to determine whether the G protein betagamma-subunit (Gbetagamma) mediates the UV-induced activation of p38 and JNK. Gbetagamma overexpression in COS-1 cells amplified the UV-induced activation of p38 but reduced JNK activation. The overexpression of the C-terminal region of beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (betaARKct) decreased the UV-induced activation of p38 but increased JNK activation. Gbeta(1)gamma(2) expression increased MKK3/6 phosphorylation with a concomitant decrease in MKK4 phosphorylation, which contrasts with betaARKct expression. Gbeta(1)gamma(2) or betaARKct expression resulted in corresponding changes in the transcriptional activity of CHOP and c-Jun. Treatment with a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, or the expression of a kinase-inactive p38 increased the UV-induced JNK activation. Expression of the constitutively active MKK6 decreased the UV-induced JNK activation. In summary, although the endogenous Gbetagamma was found to mediate about half of the UV-induced activation of p38, it was found that exogenous Gbetagamma mediates the bi-directional regulation of UV-induced p38 and JNK activation, and that this bi-directional regulation results from the inhibition of JNK activation by the p38 activated via Gbetagamma in the COS-1 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2059285544,"Small-diameter sensory neurones found in the rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) include cells sensitive to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), which express the inhibitory peptide somatostatin (SOM). Here we addressed the functional relationship between GDNF and sensory neurone-derived SOM. Topical application of GDNF through the rat isolated dorsal horn of the spinal cord promoted activity-induced release of SOM from central terminals of sensory neurones. Once released by sensory neurones, SOM is known to act, at least in part, by opposing the action of Substance P (SP) in neurogenic inflammation. Therefore, we evaluated GDNF ability to modulate two well-documented effects of peripherally and centrally administered SP. Local application of GDNF in the mouse air pouch reduced SP-induced leukocyte migration. This effect of GDNF was mimicked by the SOM analog octreotide (OCT) and required intact SOM neuronal pools. Intrathecal injection of GDNF activated rat lumbar dorsal horn neurones and inhibited intrathecal SP-induced thermal hypersensitivity. This effect of GDNF was reversed by the SOM antagonist c-SOM and mimicked by OCT. In conclusion we propose GDNF regulation of neuronal SOM release as a novel mechanism that, if explored, may lead to new therapeutic strategies based on local release of somatostatin."
https://openalex.org/W2009088425,"The classical concept of antibody binding is defined as an exclusive and high-affinity interaction with one epitope. The emerging reality about antibody combing sites, however, is that some can bind unrelated determinants. The studies presented here define this quality as epitope recognition promiscuity by analyzing the capacity of monoclonal human autoantibodies to bind sets of overlapping peptides duplicating the complete structures of T cell receptor (TCR) alpha and beta chains and immunoglobulin lambda chain. We assessed the binding of these monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to a set of homologous peptides corresponding to the CDR1 segments of human Vbeta gene products, a major epitope used in the selection of the antibodies. We present data on the binding characteristics of four human mAbs selected for the ability to bind TCR epitopes. These mAbs are IgM molecules with VH and VL sequences in germline configuration, but have diverse VH CDR3 regions. These studies aim to characterize the property of epitope promiscuity and show that the relationship between the binding site and its epitope is a complex interaction and unpredictable from antigen sequence alone. Our results support the conclusion that epitope recognition promiscuity is a genuine feature of antibody and TCR recognition."
