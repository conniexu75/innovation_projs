To understand why only a subset of tumors respond to ICB, patients with hormone receptor-positive or triple-negative breast cancer were treated with anti-PD1 before surgery. Paired pre- versus on-treatment biopsies from treatment-naive patients receiving anti-PD1 (n = 29) or patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy before anti-PD1 (n = 11) were subjected to single-cell transcriptome, T cell receptor and proteome profiling. One-third of tumors contained PD1-expressing T cells, which clonally expanded upon anti-PD1 treatment, irrespective of tumor subtype. Expansion mainly involved CD8+ T cells with pronounced expression of cytotoxic-activity (PRF1, GZMB), immune-cell homing (CXCL13) and exhaustion markers (HAVCR2, LAG3), and CD4+ T cells characterized by expression of T-helper-1 (IFNG) and follicular-helper (BCL6, CXCR5) markers. In pre-treatment biopsies, the relative frequency of immunoregulatory dendritic cells (PD-L1+), specific macrophage phenotypes (CCR2+ or MMP9+) and cancer cells exhibiting major histocompatibility complex class I/II expression correlated positively with T cell expansion. Conversely, undifferentiated pre-effector/memory T cells (TCF7+, GZMK+) or inhibitory macrophages (CX3CR1+, C3+) were inversely correlated with T cell expansion. Collectively, our data identify various immunophenotypes and associated gene sets that are positively or negatively correlated with T cell expansion following anti-PD1 treatment. We shed light on the heterogeneity in treatment response to anti-PD1 in breast cancer."

https://openalex.org/W3157602736,"Selective neurodegeneration is a critical causal factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the mechanisms that lead some neurons to perish, whereas others remain resilient, are unknown. We sought potential drivers of this selective vulnerability using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and discovered that ApoE expression level is a substantial driver of neuronal variability. Strikingly, neuronal expression of ApoE-which has a robust genetic linkage to AD-correlated strongly, on a cell-by-cell basis, with immune response pathways in neurons in the brains of wild-type mice, human ApoE knock-in mice and humans with or without AD. Elimination or over-expression of neuronal ApoE revealed a causal relationship among ApoE expression, neuronal MHC-I expression, tau pathology and neurodegeneration. Functional reduction of MHC-I ameliorated tau pathology in ApoE4-expressing primary neurons and in mouse hippocampi expressing pathological tau. These findings suggest a mechanism linking neuronal ApoE expression to MHC-I expression and, subsequently, to tau pathology and selective neurodegeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3157584621,"A key driver of patients' well-being and clinical trials for Parkinson's disease (PD) is the course that the disease takes over time (progression and prognosis). To assess how genetic variation influences the progression of PD over time to dementia, a major determinant for quality of life, we performed a longitudinal genome-wide survival study of 11.2 million variants in 3,821 patients with PD over 31,053 visits. We discover RIMS2 as a progression locus and confirm this in a replicate population (hazard ratio (HR) = 4.77, P = 2.78 × 10-11), identify suggestive evidence for TMEM108 (HR = 2.86, P = 2.09 × 10-8) and WWOX (HR = 2.12, P = 2.37 × 10-8) as progression loci, and confirm associations for GBA (HR = 1.93, P = 0.0002) and APOE (HR = 1.48, P = 0.001). Polygenic progression scores exhibit a substantial aggregate association with dementia risk, while polygenic susceptibility scores are not predictive. This study identifies a novel synaptic locus and polygenic score for cognitive disease progression in PD and proposes diverging genetic architectures of progression and susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W3158485198,"The present article provides a detailed analysis of the Darcy Forchheimer flow of hybrid nanoliquid past an exponentially extending curved surface. In the porous space, the viscous fluid is expressed by Darcy-Forchheimer. The cylindrical shaped carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) and Fe 3 O 4 (iron oxide) are used to synthesize hybrid nanofluid. At first, the appropriate similarity transformation is used to convert the modeled nonlinear coupled partial differential equations into nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations. Then the resulting highly nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations are analytically solved by the utilization of the “Homotopy analysis method” (HAM) method. The influence of sundry flow factors on velocity, temperature, and concentration profile are sketched and briefly discussed. The enhancement in both volume fraction parameter and curvature parameter k results in raises of the velocity profile. The uses of both Fe 3 O 4 and CNTs nanoparticles are expressively improving the thermophysical properties of the base fluid. Apart from this, the numerical values of some physical quantities such as skin friction coefficients, local Nusselt number, and Sherwood number for the variation of the values of pertinent parameters are displayed in tabular forms. The obtained results show that the hybrid nanofluid enhances the heat transfer rate 2.21%, 2.1%, and 2.3% using the MWCNTs, SWCNTs, and Fe 3 O 4 nanomaterials."

In this study, we introduce ai-corona , a radiologist-assistant deep learning framework for COVID-19 infection diagnosis using chest CT scans. Our framework incorporates an EfficientNetB3-based feature extractor. We employed three datasets; the CC-CCII set, the MasihDaneshvari Hospital (MDH) cohort, and the MosMedData cohort. Overall, these datasets constitute 7184 scans from 5693 subjects and include the COVID-19, non-COVID abnormal (NCA), common pneumonia (CP), non-pneumonia, and Normal classes. We evaluate ai-corona on test sets from the CC-CCII set, MDH cohort, and the entirety of the MosMedData cohort, for which it gained AUC scores of 0.997, 0.989, and 0.954, respectively. Our results indicates ai-corona outperforms all the alternative models. Lastly, our framework’s diagnosis capabilities were evaluated as assistant to several experts. Accordingly, We observed an increase in both speed and accuracy of expert diagnosis when incorporating ai-corona ’s assistance."
https://openalex.org/W3159899980,"The central dogma of biology does not allow for the study of glycans using DNA sequencing. We report a liquid glycan array (LiGA) platform comprising a library of DNA ‘barcoded’ M13 virions that display 30–1,500 copies of glycans per phage. A LiGA is synthesized by acylation of the phage pVIII protein with a dibenzocyclooctyne, followed by ligation of azido-modified glycans. Pulldown of the LiGA with lectins followed by deep sequencing of the barcodes in the bound phage decodes the optimal structure and density of the recognized glycans. The LiGA is target agnostic and can measure the glycan-binding profile of lectins, such as CD22, on cells in vitro and immune cells in a live mouse. From a mixture of multivalent glycan probes, LiGAs identify the glycoconjugates with optimal avidity necessary for binding to lectins on living cells in vitro and in vivo. Liquid glycan arrays (LiGAs), presented on M13 bacteriophage surface proteins through bioorthogonal chemistry, link surface glycans to genetic barcodes in phage DNA, enabling lectin–glycan interaction profiling by DNA sequencing."
https://openalex.org/W3124631467,"Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a potentially fatal condition characterized by granulomatous lesions with characteristic clonal mononuclear phagocytes (MNPs) harboring activating somatic mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway genes, most notably BRAFV600E. We recently discovered that the BRAFV600E mutation can also affect multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) in multisystem LCH disease. How the BRAFV600E mutation in HPCs leads to LCH is not known. Here we show that enforced expression of the BRAFV600E mutation in early mouse and human multipotent HPCs induced a senescence program that led to HPC growth arrest, apoptosis resistance and a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). SASP, in turn, promoted HPC skewing toward the MNP lineage, leading to the accumulation of senescent MNPs in tissue and the formation of LCH lesions. Accordingly, elimination of senescent cells using INK-ATTAC transgenic mice, as well as pharmacologic blockade of SASP, improved LCH disease in mice. These results identify senescent cells as a new target for the treatment of LCH."
https://openalex.org/W3157217858,"Radiomics-the high throughput extraction of quantitative features from medical images and their correlation with clinical and biological endpoints- is the subject of active and extensive research. Although the field shows promise, the generalizability of radiomic signatures is affected significantly by differences in scan acquisition and reconstruction settings. Previous studies reported on the sensitivity of radiomic features (RFs) to test-retest variability, inter-observer segmentation variability, and intra-scanner variability. A framework involving robust radiomics analysis and the application of a post-reconstruction feature harmonization method using ComBat was recently proposed to address these challenges. In this study, we investigated the reproducibility of RFs across different scanners and scanning parameters using this framework. We analysed thirteen scans of a ten-layer phantom that were acquired differently. Each layer was subdivided into sixteen regions of interest (ROIs), and the scans were compared in a pairwise manner, resulting in seventy-eight different scenarios. Ninety-one RFs were extracted from each ROI. As hypothesized, we demonstrate that the reproducibility of a given RF is not a constant but is dependent on the heterogeneity found in the data under analysis. The number (%) of reproducible RFs varied across the pairwise scenarios investigated, having a wide range between 8 (8.8%) and 78 (85.7%) RFs. Furthermore, in contrast to what has been previously reported, and as hypothesized in the robust radiomics analysis framework, our results demonstrate that ComBat cannot be applied to all RFs but rather on a percentage of those-the ""ComBatable"" RFs-which differed depending on the data being harmonized. The number (%) of reproducible RFs following ComBat harmonization varied across the pairwise scenarios investigated, ranging from 14 (15.4%) to 80 (87.9%) RFs, and was found to depend on the heterogeneity in the data. We conclude that the standardization of image acquisition protocols remains the cornerstone for improving the reproducibility of RFs, and the generalizability of the signatures developed. Our proposed approach helps identify the reproducible RFs across different datasets."
https://openalex.org/W3157044858,"The biological roles of DNA methylation have been elucidated by profiling methods based on whole-genome or reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing, but these approaches do not efficiently survey the vast numbers of non-coding regulatory elements in mammalian genomes. Here we present an extended-representation bisulfite sequencing (XRBS) method for targeted profiling of DNA methylation. Our design strikes a balance between expanding coverage of regulatory elements and reproducibly enriching informative CpG dinucleotides in promoters, enhancers and CTCF binding sites. Barcoded DNA fragments are pooled before bisulfite conversion, allowing multiplex processing and technical consistency in low-input samples. Application of XRBS to single leukemia cells enabled us to evaluate genetic copy number variations and methylation variability across individual cells. Our analysis highlights heterochromatic H3K9me3 regions as having the highest cell-to-cell variability in their methylation, likely reflecting inherent epigenetic instability of these late-replicating regions, compounded by differences in cell cycle stages among sampled cells. DNA methylation is efficiently profiled in non-coding regulatory sequences in single cells."
https://openalex.org/W3158593171,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dysfunction in aging and obesity has been related to chronic unresolved inflammation, which could be mediated by an impaired production of specialized proresolving lipid mediators (SPMs), such as Lipoxins-LXs, Resolvins-Rvs, Protectins-PDs, and Maresins-MaRs. Our aim was to characterize the changes in BAT SPMs signatures and their association with BAT dysfunction during aging, especially under obesogenic conditions, and their modulation by a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich diet. Lipidomic, functional, and molecular studies were performed in BAT of 2- and 18-month-old lean (CT) female mice and in 18-month-old diet-induced obese (DIO) mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD), or a DHA-enriched HFD. Aging downregulated Prdm16 and UCP1 levels, especially in DIO mice, while DHA partially restored them. Arachidonic acid (AA)-derived LXs and DHA-derived MaRs and PDs were the most abundant SPMs in BAT of young CT mice. Interestingly, the sum of LXs and of PDs were significantly lower in aged DIO mice compared to young CT mice. Some of the SPMs most significantly reduced in obese-aged mice included LXB4, MaR2, 4S,14S-diHDHA, 10S,17S-diHDHA (a.k.a. PDX), and RvD6. In contrast, DHA increased DHA-derived SPMs, without modifying LXs. However, MicroPET studies showed that DHA was not able to counteract the impaired cold exposure response in BAT of obese-aged mice. Our data suggest that a defective SPMs production could underlie the decrease of BAT activity observed in obese-aged mice, and highlight the relevance to further characterize the physiological role and therapeutic potential of specific SPMs on BAT development and function."
https://openalex.org/W3158295035,"Objective This study aimed to investigate the risk of Alzheimer’s disease among patients with age-related macular degeneration and its association with confounding comorbidities. Method This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study. By accessing data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan, we identified 10,578 patients aged 50–100 years who were newly diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration between 2000 and 2012 and 10,578 non- age-related macular degeneration individuals. The comorbidities assessed were osteoporosis, diabetes, cirrhosis, cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results Patients with age-related macular degeneration had a 1.23-fold increased risk of their condition advancing to Alzheimer’s disease (aHR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.04–1.46). The younger patients were diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration, the more likely patients got Alzheimer’s disease (50–64 age group: aHR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.04–3.73; 65–79 age group: aHR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.02–1.58; 80–100 age group: aHR = 1.06, 95% CI = 0.78–1.45). In addition, there were significantly higher risks of Alzheimer’s disease for patients with cirrhosis (aHR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.09–2.06) in the age-related macular degeneration cohort than in the non-age-related macular degeneration cohort. Conclusion Patients with age-related macular degeneration may exhibit a higher risk of Alzheimer’s disease than people without age-related macular degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3158378493,"In several developing countries, studies on antimicrobial resistance among bacteria from food animals are rare mostly because of under-resourced laboratories. The objective of this study was to develop and field-test a low cost protocol to estimate the isolate- and sample-level prevalence of resistance to critically important antibiotics among Escherichia coli and Salmonella isolated from dairy cattle feces. Using a predesigned protocol, fecal samples were collected to isolate non-type-specific E . coli and Salmonella using selective media without antibiotic supplements. Besides, samples were screened for E . coli and Salmonella isolates not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins and quinolones using selective media supplemented with cefotaxime (1.0 μg/mL) and ciprofloxacine (0.5 μg/mL), respectively. All bacterial isolates were further tested for antibiotic susceptibility using disk diffusion. Bacterial isolates not susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins were tested for extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) phenotype using the combination disk test. Molecular methods were performed on selected bacterial isolates to identify and distinguish genetic determinants associated with the observed phenotypes. Among 85 non-type-specific E . coli isolated from MacConkey agar without antibiotics, the isolate-level prevalence of resistance to tetracycline was the highest (8.2%). Among 37 E . coli recovered from MacConkey agar with cefotaxime, 56.8% were resistant ceftriaxone. Among 22 E . coli isolates recovered from MacConkey agar with ciprofloxacin, 77.3% and 54.5% were resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, respectively. Sixteen Salmonella were isolated and only one demonstrated any resistance (i.e., single resistance to streptomycin). Among E . coli isolates not susceptible to ceftriaxone, an AmpC phenotype was more common than an ESBL phenotype (29 versus 10 isolates, respectively). Whole genome sequencing showed that phenotypic profiles of antibiotic resistance detected were generally substantiated by genotypic profiles. The tested protocol is suited to detecting and estimating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food animal feces in resource-limited laboratories in the developing world."
https://openalex.org/W3159934423,"Objective We assessed the prevalence of, and factors associated with, heated tobacco product (HTP) use and analysed the association between HTP use and quitting combustible cigarettes (CCs) in Korean adults. Methods We conducted an online survey with 7,000 adults (males, 2,300; females, 4,700; ages 20–69) out of 70,000 age-, sex- and provincial-distribution-matched individuals based on 2018 national population statistics. Females were oversampled because the prevalence of tobacco product use is very low among women in Korea. Chi-square tests were used for bivariate analyses, and odds ratios were assessed after adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Results The prevalence of current CC, electronic cigarette (EC), and HTP use was 24.8% (males, 40.4%; females, 9.3%), 6.8% (males, 10.1%; females, 3.4%), and 10.2% (males, 16.2%; females, 4.3%), respectively. Among the 574 current HTP users, 77 (13.4%) were HTP-only users and &gt;80% were either dual users of HTP and CC/EC, or triple users of HTP, EC, and CC. Among the current CC users, the odds of having attempted to quit CCs in the past year were greater among EC-only users (aOR 2.92; 95% CI 1.81–4.69) and dual users of HTPs and ECs (aOR 8.42; 95% CI 4.85–14.62) than among non-HTP and non-EC users. Among 2,121 ever CC smokers, the likelihood of being a former CC smoker was 0.19 (95% CI 0.15–0.24) for HTP users, 0.29 (95% CI 0.20–0.42) for EC users, and 0.03 (95% CI 0.01–0.06) for users of both HTPs and ECs compared with non-HTP and non-EC users. Conclusion EC-only use and dual use of HTPs and ECs were associated with increased attempts to quit CCs; however, HTP and EC use was associated with lower odds of CC smoking abstinence."

https://openalex.org/W3158418884,"Tuberculosis (TB) presents a global threat in the world and the lung is the frequent site of metastatic focus. A previous study demonstrated that TB might increase primary lung cancer risk by two-fold for more than 20 years after the TB diagnosis. However, no large-scale study has evaluated the risk of TB and secondary lung cancer. Thus, we evaluated the risk of secondary lung cancer in patients with or without tuberculosis (TB) using a nationwide population-based dataset.In a cohort study of 1,936,512 individuals, we selected 6934 patients among patients with primary cancer and TB infection, based on the International Classification of Disease (ICD-p-CM) codes 010-011 from 2000 to 2015. The control cohort comprised 13,868 randomly selected, propensity-matched patients (by age, gender, and index date) without TB exposure. Using this adjusted date, a possible association between TB and the risk of developing secondary lung cancer was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model.During the follow-up period, secondary lung cancer was diagnosed in 761 (10.97%) patients with TB and 1263 (9.11%) patients without TB. After adjusting for covariates, the risk of secondary lung cancer was 1.67 times greater among primary cancer in the cohort with TB than in the cohort without TB. Stratification revealed that every comorbidity (including diabetes, hypertension, cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, cardiovascular accident, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) significantly increased the risk of secondary lung cancer when comparing the TB cohort with the non-TB cohort. Moreover, the primary cancer types (including head and neck, colorectal cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, breast, kidney, and thyroid cancer) had a more significant risk of becoming secondary lung cancer.A significant association exists between TB and the subsequent risk for metastasis among primary cancers and comorbidities. Therefore, TB patients should be evaluated for the subsequent risk of secondary lung cancer."

By collecting the blood lipid profiles among adult residents of Shenmu City in Shaanxi Province, China, we aim to assess and elucidate the prevalence and risk factors of dyslipidemia in this city.Stratified multistage sampling was used to survey 4,598 permanent adult residents in five areas of Shenmu (2 communities in the county seat, 2 in the southern area and 2 in the northern area) from September 2019 to December 2019. Questionnaire surveys and physical examinations were conducted. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 26.0.The average level of total cholesterol (TC) is 4.47mmol/L, that of triglyceride (TG) 1.32mmol/L, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) 1.27mmol/L, apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) 1.44g/L, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) 2.7mmol/L and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) 0.97g/L. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (HTC), hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), low high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) is 22.4%, 33.3%, 14.5%, and 5.81%, respectively, and the overall prevalence of dyslipidemia is 48.27%. Furthermore, blood lipid levels and prevalence of dyslipidemia vary by region, age, gender, occupation and educational level. Nine risk factors of dyslipidemia were identified, which are living in county seat or northern industrial area, increasing age, male, overweight or obesity, abdominal obesity, smoking, hypertension, abnormal glucose metabolism (pre-diabetes or diabetes) and hyperuricemia.The blood lipid levels and dyslipidemia prevalence of adults in Shenmu City are higher comparing to national averages of China.

https://openalex.org/W3157316531,"Background Portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) is a frequent complication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which leads to classification as advanced stage disease (regardless of the degree of PVTT) according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Classification. For such patients, systemic therapy is the standard of care. However, in clinical reality, many patients with PVTT undergo different treatments, such as resection, transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT), or best supportive care (BSC). Here we examined whether patients benefited from such alternative therapies, according to the extent of PVTT. Methods This analysis included therapy-naïve patients with HCC and PVTT treated between January 2005 and December 2016. PVTT was classified according to the Liver Cancer study group of Japan as follows: Vp1 = segmental PV invasion; Vp2 = right anterior or posterior PV; Vp3 = right or left PV; Vp4 = main trunk. Overall survival (OS) was analyzed for each treatment subgroup considering the extent of PVTT. We performed Cox regression analysis with adjustment for possible confounders. To further attenuate selection bias, we applied propensity score weighting using the inverse probability of treatment weights. Results A total of 278 treatment-naïve patients with HCC and PVTT were included for analysis. The median observed OS in months for each treatment modality (resection, TACE/SIRT, sorafenib, BSC, respectively) was 32.4, 8.1, N/A, and 1.7 for Vp1; 10.7, 6.9, 5.5, and 1.2 for Vp2; 6.6, 7.5, 2.9, and 0.6 for Vp3; and 8.0, 3.6, 5.3, and 0.7 for Vp4. Thus, the median OS in the resection group in case of segmental PVTT (Vp1) was significantly longer compared to any other treatment group (all p values &lt;0.01). Conclusions Treatment strategy for HCC with PVTT should not be limited to systemic therapy in general. The extent of PVTT should be considered when deciding on treatment alternatives. In patients with segmental PVTT (Vp1), resection should be evaluated."

Here we report the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the heme lyase CcmF, a 643-amino acid integral membrane protein, from Thermus thermophilus. CcmF contains a heme b cofactor at the bottom of a large cavity that opens toward the extracellular side to receive heme groups from the heme chaperone CcmE for cytochrome maturation. A surface groove on CcmF may guide the extended apoprotein to heme attachment at or near a loop containing the functionally essential WXWD motif, which is situated above the putative cofactor binding pocket.

We identified six key themes: 1) NOK had an accurate, positive understanding of the Last Gift clinical study; 2) NOK felt the study was conducted ethically; 3) Perceived benefits for NOK included support navigating the dying/grieving process and personal growth; 4) Perceived drawbacks included increased sadness, emotional stress, conflicted wishes between NOK and study participants, and concerns around potential invasiveness of study procedures at the EOL; 5) NOK expressed pride in loved ones' altruism; and 6) NOK provided suggestions to improve the Last Gift study, including better communication between staff and themselves. These findings provide a framework for ethical implementation of future EOL HIV cure-related research involving NOK."
https://openalex.org/W3158287886,"It is already known that there are many factors responsible for the successful grafting process in plants, including light intensity. However, the influence of the spectrum of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on this process has almost never been tested. During the pre-grafting process tomato seedlings grew for 30 days under 100 μmol m -2 s -1 of mixed LEDs (red 70%+ blue 30%). During the post-grafting period, seedlings grew for 20 days under the same light intensity but the lightening source was either red LED, mixed LEDs (red 70% + blue 30%), blue LED or white fluorescent lamps. This was done to determine which light source(s) could better improve seedling quality and increase grafting success. Our results showed that application of red and blue light mixture (R7:B3) caused significant increase in total leaf area, dry weight (total, shoot and root), total chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio, soluble protein and sugar content. Moreover, this light treatment maintained better photosynthetic performance i.e. more effective quantum yield of PSII photochemistry Y(II), better photochemical quenching (qP), and higher electron transport rate (ETR). This can be partially explained by the observed upregulation of gene expression levels of PsaA and PsbA and the parallel protein expression levels. This in turn could lead to better functioning of the photosynthetic apparatus of tomato seedlings and then to faster production of photoassimilate ready to be translocated to various tissues and organs, including those most in need, i.e., involved in the formation of the graft union."
https://openalex.org/W3158637517,"Nephrocystin (NPHP1) is a ciliary transition zone protein and its ablation causes nephronophthisis (NPHP) with partially penetrant retinal dystrophy. However, the precise requirements of NPHP1 in photoreceptors are not well understood. Here, we characterize retinal degeneration in a mouse model of NPHP1 and show that NPHP1 is required to prevent infiltration of inner segment plasma membrane proteins into the outer segment during the photoreceptor maturation. We demonstrate that Nphp1 gene-trap mutant mice, which were previously described as null, are likely hypomorphs due to the production of a small quantity of functional mRNAs derived from nonsense-associated altered splicing and skipping of two exons including the one harboring the gene-trap. In homozygous mutant animals, inner segment plasma membrane proteins such as syntaxin-3 (STX3), synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), and interphotoreceptor matrix proteoglycan 2 (IMPG2) accumulate in the outer segment when outer segments are actively elongating. This phenotype, however, is spontaneously ameliorated after the outer segment elongation is completed. Consistent with this, some photoreceptor cell loss (~30%) occurs during the photoreceptor maturation period but it stops afterward. We further show that Nphp1 genetically interacts with Cep290 , another NPHP gene, and that a reduction of Cep290 gene dose results in retinal degeneration that continues until adulthood in Nphp1 mutant mice. These findings demonstrate that NPHP1 is required for the confinement of inner segment plasma membrane proteins during the outer segment development, but its requirement diminishes as photoreceptors mature. Our study also suggests that additional mutations in other NPHP genes may influence the penetrance of retinopathy in human NPHP1 patients."
https://openalex.org/W3157083786,"Lockdown curbs the COVID-19 epidemics but at huge costs. Public debates question its impact compared to reliance on individual responsibility. We study how rationally chosen self-protective behavior impacts the spread of the epidemics and interacts with policies. We first assess the value of lockdown in terms of mortality compared to a counterfactual scenario that incorporates self-protection efforts; and second, assess how individual behavior modify the epidemic dynamics when public regulations change. We couple an SLIAR model, that includes asymptomatic transmission, with utility maximization: Individuals trade off economic and wellbeing costs from physical distancing with a lower infection risk. Physical distancing effort depends on risk aversion, perceptions of the epidemics and average distancing effort in the population. Rational distancing effort is computed as a Nash Equilibrium. Equilibrium effort differs markedly from constant, stochastic or proportional contacts reduction. It adjusts to daily incidence of hospitalization in a way that creates a slightly decreasing plateau in epidemic prevalence. Calibration on French data shows that a business-as-usual benchmark yields an overestimation of the number of deaths by a factor of 10 compared to benchmarks with equilibrium efforts. However, lockdown saves nearly twice as many lives as individual efforts alone. Public policies post-lockdown have a limited impact as they partly crowd out individual efforts.

However, little is known about motivations and barriers to wearing face coverings in the context of COVID-19 prevention, particularly among communities of color who are at an increased risk of serious illness from the disease. The purpose of this study was to identify common motivations and barriers to face covering use, as well as explore perceptions of messages encouraging the use of face coverings among a racially and ethnically diverse sample. A survey was distributed electronically to North Carolina (NC) residents through NC Department of Health and Human Services listservs in July 2020. Participants self-categorized as Latino/a (33.5%), Black (39.1%), or white or another race (27.5%). The most commonly endorsed motivations for wearing face coverings were to avoid spreading COVID-19 (77%), as well as to protect people who are vulnerable (76%) and one's community (72%). Being uncomfortable (40%) was the most commonly endorsed barrier. Messages that included a clear request (ex. please wear a face covering) and a direct benefit (ex. keep community safe) were more commonly endorsed than those that did not. Commonly endorsed motivations, behaviors, and messages differed by race and ethnicity. Increased attention to message content, message structure, and access to information and resources may aid local officials in increasing consistent use of face coverings."
https://openalex.org/W3159207328,"Self-paced treadmills are being used more frequently to study humans walking with their self-selected gaits on a range of slopes. There are multiple options to purchase a treadmill with a built-in controller, or implement a custom written self-paced controller, which raises questions about how self-paced controller affect treadmill speed and gait biomechanics on multiple slopes. This study investigated how different self-paced treadmill controller sensitivities affected gait parameters and variability on decline, level, and incline slopes. We hypothesized that increasing self-paced controller sensitivity would increase gait variability on each slope. We also hypothesized that detrended variability could help mitigate differences in variability that arise from differences in speed fluctuations created by the self-paced controllers. Ten young adults walked on a self-paced treadmill using three controller sensitivities (low, medium, and high) and fixed speeds at three slopes (decline, -10°; level, 0°; incline, +10°). Within each slope, average walking speeds and spatiotemporal gait parameters were similar regardless of self-paced controller sensitivity. With higher controller sensitivities on each slope, speed fluctuations, speed variance, and step length variance increased whereas step frequency variance and step width variance were unaffected. Detrended variance was not affected by controller sensitivity suggesting that detrending variability helps mitigate differences associated with treadmill speed fluctuations. Speed-trend step length variances, however, increased with more sensitive controllers. Further, detrended step length variances were similar for self-paced and fixed speed walking, whereas self-paced walking included substantial speed-trend step length variance not present in fixed speed walking. In addition, regardless of the self-paced controller, subjects walked fastest on the level slope with the longest steps, narrowest steps, and least variance. Overall, our findings suggest that separating gait variability into speed-trend and detrended variability could be beneficial for interpreting gait variability among multiple self-paced treadmill studies and when comparing self-paced walking with fixed speed walking."
https://openalex.org/W3157199198,"Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes plays important roles in the regulating plant development. However, Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes are rarely reported in maize, especially response to gibberellin (GA). In present study, 27 Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes were identified in the maize and they were classified into seven subfamilies (I-VII) based on phylogenetic analysis. This result was also further confirmed by their gene structure and conserved motif characteristics. And gibberellin-dioxygenases genes only occurred segmental duplication that occurs most frequently in plants. Furthermore, the gibberellin-dioxygenases genes showed different tissue expression pattern in different tissues and most of the gibberellin-dioxygenases genes showed tissue specific expression. Moreover, almost all the gibberellin-dioxygenases genes were significantly elevated in response to GA except for ZmGA2ox2 and ZmGA20ox10 of 15 gibberellin-dioxygenases genes normally expressed in leaves while 10 and 11 gibberellin-dioxygenases genes showed up and down regulated under GA treatment than that under normal condition in leaf sheath. In addition, we found that ZmGA2ox1 , ZmGA2ox4 , ZmGA20ox7 , ZmGA3ox1 and ZmGA3ox3 might be potential genes for regulating balance of GAs which play essential roles in plant development. These findings will increase our understanding of Gibberellin-dioxygenases gene family in response to GA and will provide a solid base for further functional characterization of Gibberellin-dioxygenases genes in maize."
https://openalex.org/W3157486338,"Purpose Agonistic β2-adrenergic receptor autoantibodies (β2-agAAb) have been observed in sera of patients with ocular hypertension and open-angle glaucoma (OAG). They target the β2-receptors on trabecular meshwork, ciliary body and pericytes (Junemann et al. 2018; Hohberger et al. 2019). In addition to their influence on the intraocular pressure, an association to retinal microcirculation is discussed. This study aimed to investigate foveal avascular zone (FAZ) characteristics by en face OCT angiography (OCT-A) in glaucoma suspects and its relationship to β2-agAAb status in patients with OAG. Material and methods Thirty-four patients (28 OAG, 6 glaucoma suspects) underwent standardized, clinical examination including sensory testing as white-on-white perimetry (Octopus G1, mean defect, MD) and structural measures as retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness, neuroretinal rim width (BMO-MRW), retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) thickness, and inner nuclear layer (INL) thickness with high-resolution OCT. FAZ characteristics were measured by OCT-A scans of superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP), and deep capillary plexus (DCP). FAZ-R was calculated (area FAZ (SVP)/area FAZ (ICP)). Using cardiomyocyte bioassays we analysed serum samples for the presence of β2-agAAb. Results (I) Total mean FAZ area [mm 2 ]: 0.34±0.16 (SVP), 0.24±0.12 (ICP), and 0.49±0.24 (DCP); mean FAZ-R 1.58±0.94. No correlation was seen for FAZ-R with MD, RNFL, BMO-MRW, RGCL thickness and INL thickness (p&gt;0.05). (II) ß2-agAAb have been observed in 91% patients and showed no correlation with MD, RNFL, BMO-MRW, RGCL thickness and INL thickness (p&gt;0.05). (III) FAZ-R correlated significantly with the β2-agAAb-induced increase of the beat rate of cardiomyocyte (p = 0.028). Conclusion FAZ characteristics did not correlate with any glaucoma associated functional and morphometric follow-up parameter in the present cohort. However, level of β2-agAAb showed a significantly correlation with FAZ-ratio. We conclude that β2-agAAb might be a novel biomarker in glaucoma pathogenesis showing association to FAZ-ratio with OCT-A."
https://openalex.org/W3158984887,"ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters are a class of superfamily transmembrane proteins that are commonly observed in natural organisms. The ABCC (ATP-binding cassette C subfamily) protein belongs to a subfamily of the ABC protein family and is a multidrug resistance-associated transporter that localizes to the tonoplast and plays a significant role in pathogenic microbial responses, heavy metal regulation, secondary metabolite transport, and plant growth. Recent studies have shown that the ABCC protein is also involved in the transport of anthocyanins/proanthocyanidins (PAs). To clarify the types and numbers of ABCC genes involved in PA transport in Gossypium hirsutum , the phylogenetic evolution, physical location, and structure of ABCC genes were classified by bioinformatic methods in the upland cotton genome, and the expression levels of these genes were analyzed at different developmental stages of the cotton fiber. The results showed that 42 ABCC genes were initially identified in the whole genome of upland cotton; they were designated GhABCC1-42 . The gene structure and phylogenetic analysis showed that the closely related ABCC genes were structurally identical. The analysis of chromosomal localization demonstrated that there were no ABCC gene s on the chromosomes of AD/At2, AD/At5, AD/At6, AD/At10, AD/At12, AD/At13, AD/Dt2, AD/Dt6, AD/Dt10, and AD/Dt13. Outside the genes, there were ABCC genes on other chromosomes, and gene clusters appeared on the two chromosomes AD/At11 and AD/Dt8. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that some ABCC proteins in G . hirsutum were clustered with those of Arabidopsis thaliana , Vitis vinifera and Zea mays , which are known to function in anthocyanin/PA transport. The protein structure prediction indicated that the GhABCC protein structure is similar to the AtABCC protein in A . thaliana , and most of these proteins have a transmembrane domain. At the same time, a quantitative RT-PCR analysis of 42 ABCC genes at different developmental stages of brown cotton fiber showed that the relative expression levels of GhABCC24 , GhABCC27 , GhABCC28 , GhABCC29 and GhABCC33 were consistent with the trend of PA accumulation, which may play a role in PA transport. These results provide a theoretical basis for further analysis of the function of the cotton ABCC genes and their role in the transport of PA."
https://openalex.org/W3159206453,"With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, vehicle detection in aerial images plays an important role in different applications. Comparing with general object detection problems, vehicle detection in aerial images is still a challenging research topic since it is plagued by various unique factors, e.g. different camera angle, small vehicle size and complex background. In this paper, a Feature Fusion Deep-Projection Convolution Neural Network is proposed to enhance the ability to detect small vehicles in aerial images. The backbone of the proposed framework utilizes a novel residual block named stepwise res-block to explore high-level semantic features as well as conserve low-level detail features at the same time. A specially designed feature fusion module is adopted in the proposed framework to further balance the features obtained from different levels of the backbone. A deep-projection deconvolution module is used to minimize the impact of the information contamination introduced by down-sampling/up-sampling processes. The proposed framework has been evaluated by UCAS-AOD, VEDAI, and DOTA datasets. According to the evaluation results, the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art vehicle detection algorithms for aerial images."
https://openalex.org/W3158973523,"While the neural circuits mediating normal, adaptive defensive behaviors have been extensively studied, substantially less is currently known about the network mechanisms by which aberrant, pathological anxiety is encoded in the brain. Here we investigate in mice how deletion of Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), an inhibitory synapse-specific adhesion protein that has been associated with pathological anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, alters the communication between key brain regions involved in mediating defensive behaviors. To this end, we performed multi-site simultaneous local field potential (LFP) recordings from the basolateral amygdala (BLA), centromedial amygdala (CeM), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and ventral hippocampus (vHPC) in an open field paradigm. We found that LFP power in the vHPC was profoundly increased and was accompanied by an abnormal modulation of the synchrony of theta frequency oscillations particularly in the vHPC-mPFC-BLA circuit. Moreover, deletion of Nlgn2 increased beta and gamma frequency synchrony across the network, and this increase was associated with increased center avoidance. Local deletion of Nlgn2 in the vHPC and BLA revealed that they encode distinct aspects of this avoidance phenotype, with vHPC linked to immobility and BLA linked to a reduction in exploratory activity. Together, our data demonstrate that alterations in long-range functional connectivity link synaptic inhibition to abnormal defensive behaviors, and that both exaggerated activation of normal defensive circuits and recruitment of fundamentally distinct mechanisms contribute to this phenotype. Nlgn2 knockout mice therefore represent a highly relevant model to study the role of inhibitory synaptic transmission in the circuits underlying anxiety disorders."
https://openalex.org/W3157046488,"The enrichment of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood provides a minimally invasive method for biomarker discovery in cancer. Longitudinal interrogation allows monitoring or prediction of therapy response, detection of minimal residual disease or progression, and determination of prognosis. Despite inherent phenotypic heterogeneity and differences in cell surface marker expression, most CTC isolation technologies typically use positive selection. This necessitates the optimization of marker-independent CTC methods, enabling the capture of heterogenous CTCs. The aim of this report is to compare a size-dependent and a marker-dependent CTC-isolation method, using spiked esophageal cells in healthy donor blood and blood from patients diagnosed with esophageal adenocarcinoma.Using esophageal cancer cell lines (OE19 and OE33) spiked into blood of a healthy donor, we investigated tumor cell isolation by Parsortix post cell fixation, immunostaining and transfer to a glass slide, and benchmarked its performance against the CellSearch system. Additionally, we performed DEPArray cell sorting to infer the feasibility to select and isolate cells of interest, aiming towards downstream single-cell molecular characterization in future studies. Finally, we measured CTC prevalence by Parsortix in venous blood samples from patients with various esophageal adenocarcinoma tumor stages.OE19 and OE33 cells were spiked in healthy donor blood and subsequently processed using CellSearch (n = 16) or Parsortix (n = 16). Upon tumor cell enrichment and enumeration, the recovery rate ranged from 76.3 ± 23.2% to 21.3 ± 9.2% for CellSearch and Parsortix, respectively. Parsortix-enriched and stained cell fractions were successfully transferred to the DEPArray instrument with preservation of cell morphology, allowing isolation of cells of interest. Finally, despite low CTC prevalence and abundance, Parsortix detected traditional CTCs (i.e. cytokeratin+/CD45-) in 8/29 (27.6%) of patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, of whom 50% had early stage (I-II) disease.We refined an epitope-independent isolation workflow to study CTCs in patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma. CTC recovery using Parsortix was substantially lower compared to CellSearch when focusing on the traditional CTC phenotype with CD45-negative and cytokeratin-positive staining characteristics. Future research could determine if this method allows downstream molecular interrogation of CTCs to infer new prognostic and predictive biomarkers on a single-cell level."
https://openalex.org/W3158442486,"Doxorubicin resistance is a major challenge in the successful treatment of canine diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (cDLBCL). In the present study, MethylCap-seq and RNA-seq were performed to characterize the genome-wide DNA methylation and differential gene expression patterns respectively in CLBL-1 8.0, a doxorubicin-resistant cDLBCL cell line, and in CLBL-1 as control, to investigate the underlying mechanisms of doxorubicin resistance in cDLBCL. A total of 20289 hypermethylated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected. Among these, 1339 hypermethylated DMRs were in promoter regions, of which 24 genes showed an inverse correlation between methylation and gene expression. These 24 genes were involved in cell migration, according to gene ontology (GO) analysis. Also, 12855 hypermethylated DMRs were in gene-body regions. Among these, 353 genes showed a positive correlation between methylation and gene expression. Functional analysis of these 353 genes highlighted that TGF-β and lysosome-mediated signal pathways are significantly associated with the drug resistance of CLBL-1. The tumorigenic role of TGF-β signaling pathway in CLBL-1 8.0 was further validated by treating the cells with a TGF-β inhibitor(s) to show the increased chemo-sensitivity and intracellular doxorubicin accumulation, as well as decreased p-glycoprotein expression. In summary, the present study performed an integrative analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression in CLBL-1 8.0 and CLBL-1. The candidate genes and pathways identified in this study hold potential promise for overcoming doxorubicin resistance in cDLBCL."
https://openalex.org/W3158729873,"Morphological and physiological characteristics of phytoplankton cells are highly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and, in turn, influence the dynamics of phytoplankton populations and communities. To cope with environmental change, trait variability and phenotypic plasticity may play an important role. Since global change comprises simultaneous changes in abiotic parameters, we assessed the impact of multiple drivers on functional traits of the diatom Thalassiosira (Conticribra) weissflogii by manipulating concurrently temperature, pCO 2 , and dissolved nitrogen:phosphorus (N:P) ratio. We tested three scenarios: ambient (ambient temperature and atmospheric pCO 2 ; 16 N:P ratio), moderate future scenario (+1.5°C and 800 ppm CO 2 ; 25 N:P ratio), and more severe future scenario (+3°C and 1000 ppm CO 2 ; 25 N:P ratio). We applied flow cytometry to measure on single-cell levels to investigate trait variability and phenotypic plasticity within one strain of diatoms. Growth rates differed significantly between the treatments and were strongly correlated with cell size and cellular chlorophyll a content. We observed a negative correlation of growth rate with chlorophyll a variability among single strain populations and a negative correlation with the phenotypic plasticity of cell size, i.e. when growth rates were higher, the cell size cell-to-cell variability within cultures was lower. Additionally, the phenotypic plasticity in cell size was lower under the global change scenarios. Overall, our study shows that multiple traits are interlinked and driven by growth rate and that this interconnection may partly be shaped by environmental factors."

Differential expression of >300 miRs was examined using the MIHS-3001ZE-miScript miRNA PCR Array Human miFinder 384HC. Expression levels of miRs were normalized using the global Ct mean of expressed miR and compared between groups. Data analysis was performed using GeneGlobe data analysis software. Ratios of over and under-expressed miRs were calculated and compared between groups using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.Both umbilical cord plasma and umbilical cord tissue revealed several miRs with differential expression with little overlap between the two specimen types. The most overexpressed miR in plasma of EOS patients was miR-211-5p and the most overexpressed in EOS cord tissue was miR-223-5p. ROC curves comparing the ratios of over and under-expressed miRs for EOS patients and controls resulted in an area under the curve of 0.787 for cord plasma (miR-211-5p/miR-142-3p) and 0.988 for umbilical cord tissue (miR-223-5p/miR-22-3p), indicating good discrimination.miRs show differential expression in EOS versus non-infected controls and presumed sepsis. A ratio of over and under-expressed miRs can provide a potentially sensitive and specific diagnostic test for EOS."
https://openalex.org/W3159695621,"Species have evolved unique mechanisms to combat the effects of oxidative stress inside cells. A particularly devastating consequence of an unhindered oxidation of membrane lipids in the presence of iron results in cell death, known as ferroptosis. Hallmarks of ferroptosis, including peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, are conserved among animals and plants, however, early divergence of an ancestral mammalian GPX4 (mGPX4) has complicated our understanding of mechanistic similarities between species. To this end, we performed a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis and identified that orthologous Arabidopsis GPXs (AtGPXs) are more highly related to mGPX4 than mGPX4 is to other mammalian GPXs. This high degree of conservation suggested that experimental substitution may be possible. We, therefore, ectopically expressed AtGPX1-8 in ferroptosis-sensitive mouse fibroblasts. This substitution experiment revealed highest protection against ferroptosis induction by AtGPX5, as well as moderate protection by AtGPX2, −7, and −8. Further analysis of these cells revealed substantial abatement of lipid peroxidation in response to pharmacological challenge. The results suggest that the presence of ancestral GPX4 resulted in later functional divergence and specialization of GPXs in plants. The results also challenge a strict requirement for selenocysteine activity and suggest thioredoxin as a potent parallel antioxidant system in both plants and mammals."

We evaluated the impact of age on remission induction therapy for AML.We retrospectively analyzed 3,011 adult AML patients identified from a nationwide database between January 2007 and December 2011.Three hundred twenty-nine (10.9%) acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 2,682 (89.1%) non-APL patients were analyzed. The median age was 51 years and 55% of patients were male. Six hundred twenty-three patients (21%) were at favorable risk, 1522 (51%) were at intermediate risk, and 743 (25%) were at poor risk. As the age increased, the proportion of those at favorable risk and who received induction chemotherapy decreased. After induction therapy, complete response (CR) was achieved in 81.5% (243/298) of APL and 62.4% (1,409/2,258) of non-APL patients; these rates decreased as the age increased, with an obvious decrement in those older than 60 years. The median overall survival of non-APL patients was 18.7 months, while that of APL patients was not reached, with a 75% five-year survival rate.Age impacts both the biology and clinical outcomes of AML patients. Further studies should confirm the role of induction remission chemotherapy by age group."
https://openalex.org/W3159169557,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ homeostasis relies on an appropriate balance between efflux- and influx-channel activity responding to dynamic changes of intracellular Ca2+ levels. Dysregulation of this complex signaling network has been shown to contribute to neuronal and photoreceptor death in neuro- and retinal degenerative diseases, respectively. In mice with cone cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) channel deficiency, a model of achromatopsia/cone dystrophy, cones display early-onset ER stress-associated apoptosis and protein mislocalization. Cones in these mice also show reduced cytosolic Ca2+ level and subsequent elevation in the ER Ca2+ -efflux-channel activity, specifically the inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3 R1), and deletion of IP3 R1 results in preservation of cones. This work investigated how preservation of ER Ca2+ stores leads to cone protection. We examined the effects of cone specific deletion of IP3 R1 on ER stress responses/cone death, protein localization, and ER proteostasis/ER-associated degradation. We demonstrated that deletion of IP3 R1 improves trafficking of cone-specific proteins M-/S-opsin and phosphodiesterase 6C to cone outer segments and reduces localization to cone inner segments. Consistent with the improved protein localization, deletion of IP3 R1 results in increased ER retrotranslocation protein expression, reduced proteasome subunit expression, reduced ER stress/cone death, and reduced retinal remodeling. We also observed the enhanced ER retrotranslocation in mice that have been treated with a chemical chaperone, supporting the connection between improved ER retrotranslocation/proteostasis and alleviation of ER stress. Findings from this work demonstrate the importance of ER Ca2+ stores in ER proteostasis and protein trafficking/localization in photoreceptors, strengthen the link between dysregulation of ER Ca2+ homeostasis and ER stress/cone degeneration, and support an involvement of improved ER proteostasis in ER Ca2+ preservation-induced cone protection; thereby identifying IP3 R1 as a critical mediator of ER stress and protein mislocalization and as a potential target to preserve cones in CNG channel deficiency."

Only 10% of all cases are familial form, the remaining 90% are sporadic form with unknown genetic background. The etiology of sporadic AD is still not fully understood. Pathogenesis and pathobiology of this disease are limited due to the limited number of experimental models. We used primary culture of fibroblasts derived from patients diagnosed with sporadic form of AD for investigation of dynamic properties of mitochondria, including fission-fusion process and localization of mitochondria within the cell. We observed differences in mitochondrial network organization with decreased mitochondrial transport velocity, and a drop in the frequency of fusion-fission events. These studies show how mitochondrial dynamics adapt to the conditions of long-term mitochondrial stress that prevails in cells of sporadic form of AD."

There is evidence that private sector TB treatment has substandard treatment follow-up, which could be improved using VOT. However, acceptability of VOT in the private sector has not yet been evaluated.We conducted a cross-sectional survey employing a theoretical framework for healthcare intervention acceptability to measure private provider perceptions of VOT across seven constructs in three cities of Viet Nam: Ha Noi, Ho Chi Minh City, and Hai Phong. We investigated the differences in private providers' attitudes and perceptions of VOT using mixed ordinal models to test for significant differences in responses between groups of providers stratified by their willingness to use VOT.A total of 79 private providers completed the survey. Sixty-two providers (75%) indicated they would use VOT if given the opportunity. Between private providers who would and would not use VOT, there were statistically significant differences (p≤0.001) in the providers' beliefs that VOT would help identify side effects faster and in their confidence to monitor treatment and provide differentiated care with VOT. There were also significant differences in providers' beliefs that VOT would save them time and money, address problems faced by their patients, benefit their practice and patients, and be relevant for all their patients.Private providers who completed the survey have positive views towards using VOT and specific subpopulations acknowledge the value of integrating VOT into their practice.

https://openalex.org/W3157416637,"The gas emission rate of boreholes is one of the most important indices for coal and gas outburst prediction. In this work, instantaneous gas emission velocity and environmental effects on borehole gas emission were studied. Through theoretical analysis, the mechanism of crack propagation in the coal borehole was clarified, and the effect of soft and hard coal on gas desorption and gas emission. The results of numerical simulations also indicated that the initial gas emission has a function relationship to the drilling distance and the physical characteristics of the coal seam. A novel dynamic testing technology was proposed to obtain gas emission velocity. Laboratory experiments under adsorption and desorption of CO2 and N2 were performed using coal samples from Xuehu, Fenghui, Weishe, and Wuzhong coal mines. The data of initial gas emission under different coal samples were recorded, and the fitting curves were obtained. The results show a positive correlation between initial gas emission and drilling depth. However, abnormal would occur when the drill pipe enters the soft stratification, and the maximum value of the initial gas emission of the abnormal part is 3.8 times the normal value, which indicates a high degree of sensibility to soft stratification. The results were revealed the dynamic gas emission law of boreholes."
https://openalex.org/W3158164496,"Scholars have only just begun to examine elements of young adolescents' social ecologies that explain naturalistic variation in trait mindfulness and its development over time. We argue that trait mindfulness develops as a function of chronically encountered ecologies that are likely to foster or thwart the repeated enactment of mindful states over time. Using data from 4,593 fourth and seventh grade students (50% female; MageG4 = 9.02; 71% English first language) from 32 public school districts in British Columbia (BC), Canada, we examined links from peer belonging, connectedness with adults at home, and peer victimization to mindfulness over time. Variable-centered analyses indicated that young adolescents with lower victimization in fourth grade reported higher mindfulness in seventh grade, and that cross-sectionally within seventh grade victimization, peer belonging, and connectedness with adults at home were each associated with mindfulness. Contrary to our hypothesis, connectedness with adults at home moderated the longitudinal association between victimization and mindfulness such that the negative association was stronger among young adolescents with high (vs. low) levels of connectedness with adults at home. Person-centered analysis of the fourth graders' data confirmed our variable-centered findings, yielding four latent classes of social ecology whose mindfulness levels in seventh grade largely tracked with their victimization levels (from highest to lowest mindfulness): (1) flourishing relationships, (2) unvictimized but weak relationships with adults, (3) moderately victimized but strong relationships, and (4) victimized but strong relationships. Overall, our findings contribute to a growing body of evidence indicating that trait mindfulness may develop as a function of ecologically normative experiences in young adolescents' everyday lives."
https://openalex.org/W3158487872,"Within the classical eye-blink conditioning, Purkinje cells within the cerebellum are known to suppress their tonic firing rates for a well defined time period in response to the conditional stimulus after training. The temporal profile of the drop in tonic firing rate, i.e., the onset and the duration, depend upon the time interval between the onsets of the conditional and unconditional training stimuli. Direct stimulation of parallel fibers and climbing fiber by electrodes was found to be sufficient to reproduce the same characteristic drop in the firing rate of the Purkinje cell. In addition, the specific metabotropic glutamate-based receptor type 7 (mGluR7) was found responsible for the initiation of the response, suggesting an intrinsic mechanism within the Purkinje cell for the temporal learning. In an attempt to look for a mechanism for time-encoding memory formation within individual Purkinje cells, we propose a biochemical mechanism based on recent experimental findings. The proposed mechanism tries to answer key aspects of the ""Coding problem"" of Neuroscience by focusing on the Purkinje cell's ability to encode time intervals through training. According to the proposed mechanism, the time memory is encoded within the dynamics of a set of proteins-mGluR7, G-protein, G-protein coupled Inward Rectifier Potassium ion channel, Protein Kinase A, Protein Phosphatase 1 and other associated biomolecules-which self-organize themselves into a protein complex. The intrinsic dynamics of these protein complexes can differ and thus can encode different time durations. Based on their amount and their collective dynamics within individual synapses, the Purkinje cell is able to suppress its own tonic firing rate for a specific time interval. The time memory is encoded within the effective dynamics of the biochemical reactions and altering these dynamics means storing a different time memory. The proposed mechanism is verified by both a minimal and a more comprehensive mathematical model of the conditional response behavior of the Purkinje cell and corresponding dynamical simulations of the involved biomolecules, yielding testable experimental predictions."
https://openalex.org/W3159529829,"DNA polymerases play essential functions in replication fork progression and genome maintenance. DNA lesions and drug-induced replication stress result in up-regulation and re-localization of specialized DNA polymerases η and κ. Although oncogene activation significantly alters DNA replication dynamics, causing replication stress and genome instability, little is known about DNA polymerase expression and regulation in response to oncogene activation. Here, we investigated the consequences of mutant H-RAS G12V overexpression on the regulation of DNA polymerases in h-TERT immortalized and SV40-transformed human cells. Focusing on DNA polymerases associated with the replication fork, we demonstrate that DNA polymerases are depleted in a temporal manner in response to H-RAS G12V overexpression. The polymerases targeted for depletion, as cells display markers of senescence, include the Pol α catalytic subunit (POLA1), Pol δ catalytic and p68 subunits (POLD1 and POLD3), Pol η, and Pol κ. Both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms mediate this response. Pol η (POLH) depletion is sufficient to induce a senescence-like growth arrest in human foreskin fibroblast BJ5a cells, and is associated with decreased Pol α expression. Using an SV-40 transformed cell model, we observed cell cycle checkpoint signaling differences in cells with H-RasG12V-induced polymerase depletion, as compared to Pol η-deficient cells. Our findings contribute to our understanding of cellular events following oncogene activation and cellular transformation."

Results Intention of pregnant women to use institutional delivery service was 74.3% (CI; 70.71%, 77.6%). In the multivariable logistic regression; those who had 1–3 and 4 &amp;above antenatal care 2.85(1.41, 5.75) and 3.14(1.16, 8.45) respectively, those who had past experience of institutional delivery (AOR = 3.39, 95%CI: 1.72, 6.71), parity of 1–3 and 4 &amp; above % (AOR = 0.37, 0.19, 0.71) and (AOR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.12, 0.55) respectively, rural residence (AOR = 0.51, 95%CI: 0.27, 0.96), favorable attitude (AOR = 2.93, 95%CI: 1.56, 5.50), favorable perceived behavioral control (AOR = 2.60, 95%CI: 1.44, 4.69) were factors significantly associated with intention to use institutional delivery service. Conclusion and recommendation Majority of the pregnant women were intended to deliver in the institution. Good Knowledge on institutional delivery, antenatal care visit, past experience of institutional delivery, rural residence, parity, attitude and perceived behavioral control were identified factors significantly associated with intention to use institutional delivery service. So, strengthening awareness creation and behavioral change communication programs are required at all levels of health system to raise intention of residents towards institutional delivery."
https://openalex.org/W3158068652,"This article focuses on the relationship between church population and sustainability. We carried out the study on a sample of Presbyterian churches in South Korea, and implemented dynamic optimization of the church population based on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. In particular, System Dynamics (SD) and Agent-Based Model (ABM) simulations are performed for a prototype model with key parameters that contribute to church growth. Potential parameters reflecting sustainability for churches trigger dramatic growth in church populations. We categorized five dimensions of sustainability with various multi-dimensional indicators in order to measure the level of sustainability, and we obtained the values of the indicators by analyzing a number of news articles searched with a text mining technique. As time-dependent values of sustainability are imposed on the generic SD model for church population dynamics as sustainable potential parameters, the optimized result reproduces specific features for the church population. We discuss the roles of key parameters for sustainable church growth, and the contributions of the churches to sustainability."
https://openalex.org/W3157057723,"The number of older individuals relocating from their homes to old age homes is increasing in Nepal. This study was conducted to assess the reasons why older people chose to move to old age homes, the status and forms of abuse they experienced, and the risk factors associated with their abuse before moving to old age homes.This study was a cross sectional study conducted among older adults currently residing in all the old age homes of Pokhara Lekhnath Metropolitan City. Complete enumeration of the respondents was done and data was collected consecutively, using a semi-structured interview schedule, from all older adults aged 60 years and above who had been living in the homes for at least a month. The total sample size was 109. The collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression was used as an inferential statistics to determine the predictors of abuse.A majority of the respondents (56.0%) came to old age homes on their own volition, 24.7% reported that they came to the homes because they were physically weak and they had no one to care for them at their residence, while 11% reported that they were forcefully sent by their caregivers. Out of total respondents, 60.6% reported that they experienced some form of abuse before they came to the old age home: most frequent was caregiver neglect (34.9%) and verbal abuse (34.9%), while few experienced financial abuse (2.8%). Women were at a higher risk of abuse than men (p<0.05, OR = 4.430, CI = 1.695-11.577) prior to their transfer to old age homes.A majority of the older adults who transferred to old age homes in Pokhara Lekhnath Metropolitan city had been earlier abused by their caregivers, mainly through neglect and verbal abuse, and women were at a higher risk for abuse than men."
https://openalex.org/W3157190231,"The present study aimed to compare the predictive acuity of latent class regression (LCR) modelling with: standard generalised linear modelling (GLM); and GLMs that include the membership of subgroups/classes (identified through prior latent class analysis; LCA) as alternative or additional candidate predictors. Using real world demographic and clinical data from 1,802 heart failure patients enrolled in the UK-HEART2 cohort, the study found that univariable GLMs using LCA-generated subgroup/class membership as the sole candidate predictor of survival were inferior to standard multivariable GLMs using the same four covariates as those used in the LCA. The inclusion of the LCA subgroup/class membership together with these four covariates as candidate predictors in a multivariable GLM showed no improvement in predictive acuity. In contrast, LCR modelling resulted in a 18–22% improvement in predictive acuity and provided a range of alternative models from which it would be possible to balance predictive acuity against entropy to select models that were optimally suited to improve the efficient allocation of clinical resources to address the differential risk of the outcome (in this instance, survival). These findings provide proof-of-principle that LCR modelling can improve the predictive acuity of GLMs and enhance the clinical utility of their predictions. These improvements warrant further attention and exploration, including the use of alternative techniques (including machine learning algorithms) that are also capable of generating latent class structure while determining outcome predictions, particularly for use with large and routinely collected clinical datasets, and with binary, count and continuous variables."
https://openalex.org/W3157565336,"Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a well-established sensors in the recent ionosphere research. By comparing with classical meteorological equipments, the GNSS application can obtain more reliable and precious ionospheric total electron content (TEC) result. However, the most used GNSS ionospheric tomography technique is sensitive to a priori information due to the sparse and non-uniform distribution of GNSS stations. In this paper, we propose an improved method based on adaptive Laplacian smoothing and algebraic reconstruction technique (ALS-ART). Compared with traditional constant constraints, this method is less dependent on a priori information and adaptive smoothing constraints is closer to the actual situation. Tomography experiments using simulated data show that reconstruction accuracy of ionospheric electron density using ALS-ART method is significantly improved. We also use the method to do the analysis of real observation data and compare the tomography results with ionosonde observation data. The results demonstrate the superiority and reliability of the proposed method compared to traditional constant constraints method which will further improve the capability of obtaining precious ionosphere TEC by using GNSS."
