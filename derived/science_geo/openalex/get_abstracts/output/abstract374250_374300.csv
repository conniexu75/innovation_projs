https://openalex.org/W2030920549,"Recent studies have shown that puberty starts at younger ages than previously. It has been hypothesized that the increasing prevalence of childhood obesity is contributing to this trend. The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between prepubertal body mass index (BMI) and pubertal timing, as assessed by age at onset of pubertal growth spurt (OGS) and at peak height velocity (PHV), and the secular trend of pubertal timing given the prepubertal BMI.Annual measurements of height and weight were available in all children born from 1930 to 1969 who attended primary school in the Copenhagen municipality; 156,835 children fulfilled the criteria for determining age at OGS and PHV. The effect of prepubertal BMI at age seven on these markers of pubertal development within and between birth cohorts was analyzed. BMI at seven years was significantly inversely associated with age at OGS and PHV. Dividing the children into five levels of prepubertal BMI, we found a similar secular trend toward earlier maturation in all BMI groups.The heavier both boys and girls were at age seven, the earlier they entered puberty. Irrespective of level of BMI at age seven, there was a downward trend in the age at attaining puberty in both boys and girls, which suggests that the obesity epidemic is not solely responsible for the trend."
https://openalex.org/W2039482967,"SIRT1 (Sirtuin type 1), a mammalian orthologue of yeast SIR2 (silent information regulator 2), has been shown to mediate a variety of calorie restriction (CR)-induced physiological events, such as cell fate regulation via deacetylation of the substrate proteins. However, whether SIRT1 deacetylates activator protein-1 (AP-1) to influence its transcriptional activity and target gene expression is still unknown. Here we demonstrate that SIRT1 directly interacts with the basic leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun, the major components of AP-1, by which SIRT1 suppressed the transcriptional activity of AP-1. This process requires the deacetylase activity of SIRT1. Notably, SIRT1 reduced the expression of COX-2, a typical AP-1 target gene, and decreased prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production of peritoneal macrophages (pMΦs). pMΦs with SIRT1 overexpression displayed improved phagocytosis and tumoricidal functions, which are associated with depressed PGE2. Furthermore, SIRT1 protein level was up-regulated in CR mouse pMΦs, whereas elevated SIRT1 decreased COX-2 expression and improved PGE2-related macrophage functions that were reversed following inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase activity. Thus, our results indicate that SIRT1 may be a mediator of CR-induced macrophage regulation, and its deacetylase activity contributes to the inhibition of AP-1 transcriptional activity and COX-2 expression leading to amelioration of macrophage function.

In response to growth factors, cytokines, oxidative stress, or pharmacological stimuli, such as phorbol 12-myrisatate 13-acetate (PMA), AP-1 binds to the promoters of target genes to modulate their expression, which is in turn involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and inflammation (1.Eferl R.

Fos and Jun belong to the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, which preferentially binds to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element sites and to the cAMP response element with slightly lower affinity (2.Angel P.

The transcriptional activity of AP-1 is regulated by the post-translational modification, including acetylation (5.Vries R.G. Prudenziati M. Zwartjes C. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A.

The expression and activity of COX-2 are induced by various stimuli such as PMA, inflammatory factors (lipopolysaccharide), growth factors, and cytokines. COX-2 expression is increased in cells from aged animals, whereas calorie restriction (CR), a regimen extending the life span of organisms and maintaining many physiological processes in a youthful state, suppresses the age-related COX-2 increase (12.Kim Y.J.

SIRT1, the mammalian orthologue of Sir2, is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase of numerous substrates. SIRT1 has been shown to mediate a variety of physiological events such as cell fate regulation, increased metabolic rate, and higher oxygen consumption by deacetylation of the substrate targets. For example, SIRT1 deacetylates p53 protein at lysine 382 and represses its transcriptional function to protect cells from apoptosis (13.Guarente L. Picard F. Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Deacetylation of FOXO3 and FOXO4 by SIRT1 switches cells from apoptosis to cell cycle arrest under stress (14.Motta M.C. Divecha N. Lemieux M. Kamel C. Chen D. Gu W. Bultsma Y. McBurney M.

SIRT1 deacetylates liver X-activated receptors and positively regulates its activity, promoting cholesterol efflux from cells (16.Li X. Zhang S. Blander G. Tse J.G. Krieger M. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 91-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). In macrophage cell line MonoMac6, SIRT1 has been reported to inhibit proinflammatory mediator release including interleukin-8 and tumor necrosis factor-α through deacetylating RelA/p65 subunit and inhibiting NF-κB (17.Yang S.R.

Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In mammals, CR up-regulates expression of SIRT1 in a variety of tissues including kidney, liver, and fat, and SIRT1 transgenic mice display some phenotypes similar to mice on a calorie-restricted diet (18.Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 19.Bordone L.

SIRT1 is implicated in CR-induced physiological events such as cell survival and senescence effects by regulating its substrates of SIRT1, such as p53 and FOXOs (20.Rogina B. Helfand S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 15998-16003Crossref PubMed Scopus (1054) Google Scholar). CR has also been reported to influence macrophage functions (21.Stapleton P.P. Fujita J. Murphy E.M. Naama H.A.

Fernandes G. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2523-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that SIRT1 may decrease AP-1 activity and COX-2 expression to modulate macrophage function and that up-regulation of SIRT1 in macrophages may mimic the beneficial effect of CR on macrophages. In this report, we identified the direct interaction between SIRT1 and the bZIP domain of c-Fos/c-Jun and found that the deacetylase activity of SIRT1 is required for repression of AP-1 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, SIRT1 inhibited COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in macrophages, resulting in improved macrophage phagocytosis and tumoricidal functions. Finally, our results demonstrated that SIRT1 expression is increased in macrophages from CR mice, leading to decreased COX-2 expression and PGE2 production, and improves PGE2-related macrophage functions.DISCUSSIONSIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase that catalyzes the removal of acetyl groups from a number of histone or non-histone targets, belonging to class III deacetylase (30.Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar, 31.Imai S. Armstrong C.M. Kaeberlein M. Guarente L. Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). The non-histone substrates of SIRT1 include a variety of important transcription factors and some transcription co-factors, such as p53, FOXOs, and PGC-1α (13.Guarente L. Picard F. Cell. 2005; 120: 473-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 32.Gasser S.M. Cockell M.M. Gene. 2001; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The downstream effects of target deacetylation include changes in cellular metabolism, cell survival, and senescence. The biological functions of SIRT1 are thought to be mediated by its deacetylase activity (33.Brooks C.L. Gu W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 123-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In the present study we found that SIRT1 decreased c-Fos/c-Jun acetylation induced by p300 and inhibited the transcriptional activity of AP-1. Moreover, RSV, which mimics the effect of SIRT1 (34.Borra M.T. Smith B.C. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 17187-17195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar, 35.Howitz K.T. Bitterman K.J. Cohen H.Y. Lamming D.W. Lavu S. Wood J.G. Zipkin R.E. Chung P. Kisielewski A. Zhang L.L. Scherer B. Sinclair D.A. Nature. 2003; 425: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (3115) Google Scholar), decreased AP-1 transcriptional activity synergistically with SIRT1. Sirtuin inhibitor (36.Grubisha O. Smith B.C. Denu J.M. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4607-4616Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) Sirtinol, however, abolished the inhibitory effect of SIRT1 on AP-1 transcription. Furthermore, we found that SIRT1 inhibited AP-1 DNA binding to the COX-2 promoter in accordance with the previous report that acetylation modification is crucial for the DNA binding activity of transcriptional factors (6.Luo J. Li M. Tang Y. Laszkowska M. Roeder R.G. Gu W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, our experiments also identified the specific AP-1-binding regions of SIRT1, namely the C terminus and the catalytic domain. The inhibitory effects on AP-1 transcriptional activity of constructs containing both domains were similar to full-length SIRT1. The C terminus of SIRT1 itself could bind AP-1, although it alone did not suppress AP-1 luciferase activity, implicating that the catalytic domain is necessary for the SIRT1-mediated inhibitory effects on AP-1. Taken together, these results indicate that SIRT1 deacetylase activity plays important roles in inducing AP-1 transcriptional inhibition.For AP-1, the conserved bZIP domain is crucial for transcriptional regulation because it is responsible not only for dimerization and DNA binding but also for the interaction between the bZIP domain and other transcriptional factors or co-regulators. Earlier studies have shown that the basic region of c-Fos and c-Jun is involved in the interaction with general transcriptional factors, including TFIIE and TFIIF (37.Martin M.L. Lieberman P.M. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bZIP domain has also been shown to interact with TATA-binding protein association factor-1 (38.Lively T.N. Nguyen T.N. Galasinski S.K. Goodrich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26257-26265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and the multiprotein bridging factor 1 (3.Miotto B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 5969-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). More recently, two groups reported binding between c-Jun and SIRT1 (39.Dey S. Bakthavatchalu V. Tseng M.T. Wu P. Florence R. Grulke E.A. Yokel R. Dhar S.K. Yang H.S. Chen Y. St Clair D.K. Carcinogenesis. 2008; 29: 1920-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 40.Gao Z. Ye J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 376: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In line with these observations and extended to c-Fos, we found that SIRT1 directly interacted with the bZIP domain of both c-Fos and c-Jun, resulting in a reduction in the p300-induced acetylation of c-Fos and c-Jun. c-Jun has been reported to be acetylated by CBP/p300 at 271 lysine residues within the basic region of bZIP domain (5.Vries R.G. Prudenziati M. Zwartjes C. Verlaan M. Kalkhoven E. Zantema A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6095-6103Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), which promoted us to investigate the relationships between the acetylation status of the basic region and SIRT1-mediated transcriptional inhibition. Surprisingly, none of the lysine mutants within the basic region of c-Jun affected AP-1 transcriptional activity in our experiments (data not shown). Recent reports showed that the N terminus of SIRT1, which lacks the deacetylase activity, was sufficient to stimulate the methyltransferase activity of SUV39H1. It may be because the N terminus of SIRT1 could alter conformation of SUV39H1 by direct interaction (41.Vaquero A. Scher M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Serrano L. Reinberg D. Nature. 2007; 450: 440-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Indeed, SIRT1 can utilize a noncatalytic mechanism to protect neuron survival (42.Pfister J.A. Ma C. Morrison B.E. D'Mello S.R. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3: e4090Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Further studies are needed to elucidate whether the binding of SIRT1 to bZIP domain of c-Fos and c-Jun participates in AP-1 transcriptional regulation in a deacetylase-independent manner.CR decreases AP-1 DNA binding in mouse epidermis (43.Przybyszewski J. Yaktine A.L. Duysen E. Blackwood D. Wang W. Au A. Birt D.F. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and attenuates the aging-related AP-1 activation (23.Castello L. Froio T. Cavallini G. Biasi F. Sapino A. Leonarduzzi G. Bergamini E. Poli G. Chiarpotto E. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1863-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 44.Kim H.J. Jung K.J. Seo A.Y. Choi J.S. Yu B.P. Chung H.C. Age. 2002; 25: 123-130Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Numerous studies have linked the beneficial effects of mammalian CR with increased cellular SIRT1 expression (18.Cohen H.Y. Miller C. Bitterman K.J. Wall N.R. Hekking B. Kessler B. Howitz K.T. Gorospe M. de Cabo R. Sinclair D.A. Science. 2004; 305: 390-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar, 26.Picard F. Kurtev M. Chung N.

Our results proved that overexpression of SIRT1 suppressed AP-1 activity, which seems to explain AP-1 inhibition by CR. Furthermore, CR has also been shown to decrease COX-2 expression (12.Kim Y.J. Kim H.J. No J.K. Chung H.Y. Fernandes G. Life Sci. 2006; 78: 2523-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and plasma PGE2 levels (45.Kalani R. Judge S. Carter C. Pahor M. Leeuwenburgh C. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2006; 61: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Excessive PGE2 destroys the macrophage-induced cytotoxicity of tumor cells (11.Yamada H. Kuroda E. Matsumoto S. Matsumoto T. Yamada T. Yamashita U. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2002; 128: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and the phagocytosis activity of macrophages (7.Serezani C.H. Chung J.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). In the present study, macrophages with adenovirus-mediated SIRT1 overexpression displayed similar effects on COX-2 expression, PGE2 production, and macrophage functions, compared with CR mice macrophages where higher endogenous SIRT1 was expressed. Because CR has been reported to broadly suppress carcinogenesis and counteract aging-related chronic inflammatory diseases, such as neural degeneration diseases and atherosclerosis (23.Castello L. Froio T. Cavallini G. Biasi F. Sapino A. Leonarduzzi G. Bergamini E. Poli G. Chiarpotto E. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 1863-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 24.Birt D.F. Pelling J.C. White L.T.

Genet. 2000; 25: 294-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar), the up-regulated SIRT1 in macrophages may represent a novel mechanism whereby CR is beneficial.Sirtinol or knockdown of SIRT1 by RNAi similarly promoted AP-1 functions with promoting AP-1 transcriptional activity and COX-2 expression. Moreover, Sirtinol also abolished the CR-induced suppression of PGE2 production and improvement of macrophage functions, which implicate a potential role for deacetylase activity in the modulation of macrophage functions.In summary, SIRT1 interacts with the bZIP domain of c-Fos/c-Jun and inhibits AP-1 transcriptional activity. The deacetylase activity of SIRT1 contributes to the decreased AP-1 transcriptional activity, reduced COX-2 expression, decreased PGE2 production, and improved PGE2-related macrophage phagocytosis and tumoricidal functions. Furthermore, SIRT1 may mediate CR-induced amelioration of macrophage functions through its deacetylase activity. These findings suggest that reinforcing SIRT1 activity in macrophages may be an effective strategy to prevent inflammatory diseases.

SIRT1, the mammalian orthologue of Sir2, is a NAD+-dependent deacetylase of numerous substrates. SIRT1 has been shown to mediate a variety of physiological events such as cell fate regulation, increased metabolic rate, and higher oxygen consumption by deacetylation of the substrate targets. For example, SIRT1 deacetylates p53 protein at lysine 382 and represses its transcriptional function to protect cells from apoptosis (13.Guarente L. Picard F.

https://openalex.org/W2129422864,"β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a transmembrane aspartyl protease with a lumenal active site that sheds the ectodomains of membrane proteins through juxtamembrane proteolysis. BACE1 has been studied principally for its role in Alzheimer's disease as the β-secretase responsible for generating the amyloid-β protein. Emerging evidence from mouse models has identified the importance of BACE1 in myelination and cognitive performance. However, the substrates that BACE1 processes to regulate these functions are unknown, and to date only a few β-secretase substrates have been identified through candidate-based studies. Using an unbiased approach to substrate identification, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis of two human epithelial cell lines stably expressing BACE1 and identified 68 putative β-secretase substrates, a number of which we validated in a cell culture system. The vast majority were of type I transmembrane topology, although one was type II and three were GPI-linked proteins. Intriguingly, a preponderance of these proteins are involved in contact-dependent intercellular communication or serve as receptors and have recognized roles in the nervous system and other organs. No consistent sequence motif predicting BACE1 cleavage was identified in substrates versus non-substrates. These findings expand our understanding of the proteins and cellular processes that BACE1 may regulate, and suggest possible mechanisms of toxicity arising from chronic BACE1 inhibition."

In this study, MRPL10 (mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10) was identified as the major acetylated protein in the mitochondrial ribosome. Ribosome-associated SIRT3 was found to be responsible for deacetylation of MRPL10 in an NAD+-dependent manner. We mapped the acetylated Lys residues by tandem mass spectrometry and determined the role of these residues in acetylation of MRPL10 by site-directed mutagenesis. Furthermore, we observed that the increased acetylation of MRPL10 led to an increase in translational activity of mitochondrial ribosomes in Sirt3−/− mice. In a similar manner, ectopic expression and knockdown of SIRT3 in C2C12 cells resulted in the suppression and enhancement of mitochondrial protein synthesis, respectively. Our findings constitute the first evidence for the regulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis by the reversible acetylation of the mitochondrial ribosome and characterize MRPL10 as a novel substrate of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase, SIRT3.

Thus, SIRT3 and SIRT4 modulate mitochondrial function in response to its [NADH]/[NAD+] ratio by regulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes.In addition to metabolic enzymes, nucleus-encoded subunits of the electron transport chain complexes were found to be acetylated (1.Kim S.C.

In fact, Complex I subunit NDUFA9 is a SIRT3 substrate, and acetylation/deacetylation of Complex I is proposed to regulate and maintain basal ATP levels in mammalian mitochondria (16.Ahn B.H.

The synthesis of these proteins is carried out by mitochondrial ribosomes within this organelle.

Using various biochemical and proteomics techniques, we also show that SIRT3 interacts with the mitochondrial ribosome. We propose that mitochondrial protein synthesis is regulated by reversible acetylation of MRPL10 and that the NAD+-dependent SIRT3 stimulates deacetylation of MRPL10, consequently regulating protein synthesis in mammalian mitochondria."

To elucidate the mechanisms of strain responsiveness in bone cells, we investigated in vitro the responses of primary mouse osteoblasts and UMR-106 osteoblast-like cells to a single period of dynamic strain. This stimulates a cascade of events, including activation of insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-mediated phosphorylation of AKT, inhibition of GSK-3β, increased activation of β-catenin, and associated lymphoid-enhancing factor/T cell factor-mediated transcription. Initiation of this pathway does not involve the Wnt/LRP5/Frizzled receptor and does not culminate in increased IGF transcription. The effect of strain on IGF-IR is mimicked by exogenous des-(1–3)IGF-I and is blocked by the IGF-IR inhibitor H1356. Inhibition of strain-related prostanoid and nitric oxide production inhibits strain-related (and basal) AKT activity, but their separate ectopic administration does not mimic it. Strain-related IGF-IR activation of AKT requires estrogen receptor α (ERα) with which IGF-1R physically associates. The ER blocker ICI 182,780 increases the concentration of des-(1–3)IGF-I necessary to activate this cascade, whereas estrogen inhibits both basal AKT activity and its activation by des-(1–3)IGF-I. These data suggest an initial cascade of strain-related events in osteoblasts in which strain activates IGF-IR, in association with ERα, so initiating phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-dependent activation of β-catenin and altered lymphoid-enhancing factor/T cell factor transcription. This cascade requires prostanoid/nitric oxide production and is independent of Wnt/LRP5.

IntroductionThe strains that bones experience during everyday mechanical loading are generally accepted as providing the functional stimulus by which they adjust their mass and architecture to withstand these loads without gross fracture or undue accumulation of microdamage. The cells responsible for the initial transduction of strain-related information are the osteoblasts and osteocytes that are in close physical association with the tissue subjected to strain. A number of signaling pathways are activated in the first few minutes following an episode of strain. These include the following: fluxes in calcium (1.Klein-Nulend J. van der Plas A. Semeins C.M.

A contributor to more than one stage in a number of these post-strain cascades is ERα (22.Lee K.C. Jessop H. Suswillo R. Zaman G. Lanyon L.E. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 182: 193-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 23.Lee K. Jessop H. Suswillo R. Zaman G. Lanyon L. Nature. 2003; 424: 389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Jessop H.L.

ERα is required for strain-related production of NO (24.Jessop H.L. Suswillo R.F. Rawlinson S.C. Zaman G. Lee K. Das-Gupta V. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner.

Exposure of bone cells to strain activates ERK1/2 in a manner requiring ERα (25.Aguirre J.I. Plotkin L.I. Gortazar A.R. Millan M.M. O'Brien C.A. Manolagas S.C. Bellido T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25501-25508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In turn, ERK1/2 activated by strain results in the phosphorylation of ERα (2.Jessop H.L. Rawlinson S.C. Pitsillides A.A. Lanyon L.E. Bone. 2002; 31: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and subsequent activation of estrogen-response elements.Although the nature of the facilitatory role of ERα in these strain-related processes in bone cells is unclear, its practical significance is likely to be high in the light of the crucial role played by estrogen in the etiology of post-menopausal osteoporosis in women and age-related bone loss in men (23.Lee K. Jessop H. Suswillo R. Zaman G. Lanyon L. Nature. 2003; 424: 389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Lanyon L. Armstrong V. Ong D. Zaman G. Price J. J. Endocrinol. 2004; 182: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To establish the scope of ERα in the adaptive responses of bone cells to strain, we therefore investigated its relationship with insulin-like growth factor (IGF), another important mediator of the strain-related responses of bone cells. IGF-I and II both play a significant role in the regulation of bone mass. During fetal and juvenile development, IGF-I production by the liver, acting under the control of growth hormone, is one of the chief determinants of bone growth. Individuals lacking growth hormone, IGF-I, or IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) exhibit reduced stature (27.Bikle D. Majumdar S. Laib A. Powell-Braxton L. Rosen C. Beamer W. Nauman E. Leary C. Halloran B. J.

However, in the normal adult, the major functional determinant of bone mass is adaptive (re)modeling controlled by functional loading. This process is associated with local autocrine/paracrine production of IGF (30.Raab-Cullen D.M. Thiede M.A. Petersen D.N. Kimmel D.B. Recker R.R. Calcif.

Zaman G. Mohan S. Baylink D.J. Lanyon L.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 593-602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as is the case in neuronal cells (36.Topalli I. Etgen A.M.

Although these data strongly suggest a role for cross-talk between IGF-I and ERα signaling in the propagation of adaptive bone (re)modeling, the precise molecular mechanism responsible and the downstream targets remain undetermined. One pathway capable of being activated by IGFs that could act as a downstream effector for ERα and IGF interaction in osteoblasts is the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein-kinase B pathway (PI3K/AKT).PI3K is activated by numerous receptor tyrosine kinases, including the IGF-I receptor, and is responsible for activating the serine/threonine kinase AKT, which plays a significant role in maintaining proliferation and promoting cell survival (39.Manning B.D.

These findings implicate AKT in interacting with three of the key contributors to the strain response, namely IGF, canonical Wnt signaling via β-catenin, and ERα.That the activation state of AKT should correlate well with anabolic or catabolic activity of bone should not be surprising because AKT controls these processes in many cell types (39.Manning B.D. Cantley L.C. Cell. 2007; 129: 1261-1274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). What is important in the context of mechanically adaptive response of bones is how the activity of AKT is controlled and how AKT targets respond to facilitate the anabolic and catabolic (re)modeling activity, which results in alterations in bone mass and adjustments in bone architecture.In this study, we report that a single episode of mechanical strain stimulates the activation of β-catenin in the absence of increased Wnt/LRP5/Frizzled receptor signaling. This pathway involves IGF-dependent activation of IGF-IR that stimulates PI3K-mediated activation of AKT. AKT in turn generates inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3β resulting in activation of β-catenin and stimulation of Lef/TCF-mediated transcription. This pathway requires NO/PG signaling. Mechanical strain primes ERα via an unidentified mechanism (possibly involving its translocation to the membrane) to interact physically with IGF-IR. This interaction lowers the threshold levels of IGF-I necessary to stimulate IGF-IR activation. The relationship between the deficiency of ERα in patients with osteoporosis and in ERKO mice and their attenuated response to loading may in part be explained by a failure of prevailing IGF levels to activate IGF-1R in the absence of sufficient ERα.DISCUSSIONThe data presented here demonstrate that when osteoblast-like cells, either primary cultures of normal mouse long bone-derived osteoblasts or those of the UMR-106 cell line, experience even a single short period of dynamic strain capable of stimulating proliferation in vitro, and new bone formation in vivo, there is rapid PI3K-mediated activation of AKT, AKT-mediated inhibition of GSK-3β, and increased levels of active nuclear β-catenin. These strain-related changes, which are accompanied by consequent increased Lef/TCF-dependent transcription, do not involve the Wnt/LRP5/Frizzled receptor. The activation of AKT by strain appears to proceed via a mechanism that involves IGF-IR. The ectopic addition of des-(1–3)IGF-I mimics strain-related activation of AKT followed by inhibition of GSK-3β, activation of β-catenin, and its translocation to the nucleus. Of potentially critical importance to the etiology of post-menopausal osteoporosis, IGF-IR-mediated activation of AKT by both strain and IGF involves ERα, which physically associates with IGF-IR. Inhibition of ERα by the selective ER modulator ICI 182,780 increases the concentration of des-(1–3)IGF-I necessary to stimulate IGF-IR-mediated activation of AKT. Interestingly, in this context estradiol inhibits ERα-related activation of IGF-IR because it reduces basal and des-(1–3)IGF-I-dependent phosphorylation of AKT. This suggestion that in osteoblastic cells estradiol competes for ERα with IGF1R may have profound consequences for strain-related control of bone (re)modeling when ERα is in short supply.It has long been recognized that one of the early responses of osteoblasts to strain is increased production of prostaglandins and nitric oxide. We show here that neither of these added exogenously mimics strain-related activation of the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin axis. However, blocking the production of NO or PGs, or inhibition of PG receptor signaling, reduces both basal and strain-related activation of IGF-IR and AKT with no change in the levels of IGF-I transcription.Strain-related Increases in β-Catenin and Lef/TCF Activity in Osteoblast-like Cells Are Dependent on AKT Activation but Do Not Involve the Wnt/LRP5/Frizzled ReceptorWe previously reported that a single period of dynamic strain was sufficient to increase levels of active β-catenin in the nucleus of osteoblast-like cells and to elevate Lef/TCF-dependent transcription (14.Armstrong V.J.

Here, we show that the Lrp5/6 inhibitor Dickkopf 1 was able to block Wnt1-dependent, but not strain-dependent, activation of Lef/TCF signaling. This suggests that Lef/TCF activation during the early phase of the strain response is independent of Wnts, thus agreeing with the findings of Case et al. (45.Case N. Ma M. Sen B. Xie Z. Gross T.S. Rubin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 29196-29205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) who demonstrated that the addition of recombinant Dickkopf 1 was unable to block the increased expression of the Lef/TCF target gene following stretching.Low AKT activity in osteoblasts correlates broadly with lower bone mass, higher levels of osteoblast apoptosis (42.Kawamura N.

Zylstra C.R. Liu J. Cichowski R. Faugere M.C. Bouxsein M.L. Wan C. Williams B.O. Clemens T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.. 2007; 104: 2259-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This suggests that AKT activity corresponds to the anabolic status of the bone. Given the central role of AKT in regulating cell growth, proliferation, and apoptosis in virtually every cell type in the body, it is not unexpected that AKT should be a central regulator of these parameters in bone.The importance of AKT in the adaptive response of bones to loading lies first in the mechanism of its specific, strain-related activation and second in the function of its downstream targets.

In terms of the temporal kinetics of the strain response, it may be that early activation of β-catenin by AKT and prolonged activation by Wnts maintain an “umbrella” of β-catenin signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2013470723,"Background Intramyocellular lipid accumulation is strongly related to insulin resistance in humans, and we have shown that high glucose concentration induced de novo lipogenesis and insulin resistance in murin muscle cells. Alterations in Wnt signaling impact the balance between myogenic and adipogenic programs in myoblasts, partly due to the decrease of Wnt10b protein. As recent studies point towards a role for Wnt signaling in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that activation of Wnt signaling could play a crucial role in muscle insulin sensitivity. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we demonstrate that SREBP-1c and Wnt10b display inverse expression patterns during muscle ontogenesis and regeneration, as well as during satellite cells differentiation. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway was reactivated in contracting myotubes using siRNA mediated SREBP-1 knockdown, Wnt10b over-expression or inhibition of GSK-3β, whereas Wnt signaling was inhibited in myoblasts through silencing of Wnt10b. SREBP-1 knockdown was sufficient to induce Wnt10b protein expression in contracting myotubes and to activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Conversely, silencing Wnt10b in myoblasts induced SREBP-1c protein expression, suggesting a reciprocal regulation. Stimulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway i) drastically decreased SREBP-1c protein and intramyocellular lipid deposition in myotubes; ii) increased basal glucose transport in both insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant myotubes through a differential activation of Akt and AMPK pathways; iii) restored insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant myotubes. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in skeletal muscle cells improved insulin sensitivity by i) decreasing intramyocellular lipid deposition through downregulation of SREBP-1c; ii) increasing insulin effects through a differential activation of the Akt/PKB and AMPK pathways; iii) inhibiting the MAPK pathway. A crosstalk between these pathways and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in skeletal muscle opens the exciting possibility that organ-selective modulation of Wnt signaling might become an attractive therapeutic target in regenerative medicine and to treat obese and diabetic populations."
https://openalex.org/W1972346050,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are predicted to regulate approximately 30% of all human genes; however, only a few miRNAs have been assigned their targets and specific functions. Here we demonstrate that miR-24, a ubiquitously expressed miRNA, has an anti-proliferative effect independent of p53 function. Cell lines with differential p53 status were used as a model to study the effects of miR-24 on cell proliferation, cell cycle control, gene regulation and cellular transformation. Overexpression of miR-24 in six different cell lines, independent of p53 function, inhibited cell proliferation and resulted in G2/S cell cycle arrest. MiR-24 over expression in cells with wt-p53 upregulated TP53 and p21 protein; however, in p53-null cells miR-24 still induced cell cycle arrest without the involvement of p21. We show that miR-24 regulates p53-independent cellular proliferation by regulating an S-phase enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) a target of the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (MTX). Of interest, we found that a miR-24 target site polymorphism in DHFR 3' UTR that results in loss of miR-24-function and high DHFR levels in the cell imparts a growth advantage to immortalized cells and induces neoplastic transformation. Of clinical significance, we found that miR-24 is deregulated in human colorectal cancer tumors and a subset of tumors has reduced levels of miR-24. A novel function for miR-24 as a p53-independent cell cycle inhibitory miRNA is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1987905487,"Little is known about reproductive health in severely obese women. In this study, we present associations between different levels of severe obesity and a wide range of health outcomes in the mother and child.From the Danish National Birth Cohort, we obtained self-reported information about prepregnant body mass index (BMI) for 2451 severely obese women and 2450 randomly selected women from the remaining cohort who served as a comparison group. Information about maternal and infant outcomes was also self-reported or came from registers. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between different levels of severe obesity and reproductive outcomes.Subfecundity was more frequent in severely obese women, and during pregnancy, they had an excess risk of urinary tract infections, gestational diabetes, preeclampsia and other hypertensive disorders which increased with severity of obesity. They tended to have a higher risk of both pre- and post-term birth, and risk of cesarean and instrumental deliveries increased across obesity categories. After birth, severely obese women more often failed to initiate or sustain breastfeeding. Risk of weight retention 1.5 years after birth was similar to that of other women, but after adjustment for gestational weight gain, the risk was increased, especially in women in the lowest obesity category. In infants, increasing maternal obesity was associated with decreased risk of a low birth weight and increased risk of a high birth weight. Estimates for ponderal index showed the same pattern indicating an increasing risk of neonatal fatness with severity of obesity. Infant obesity measured one year after birth was also increased in children of severely obese mothers.Severe obesity is correlated with a substantial disease burden in reproductive health. Although the causal mechanisms remain elusive, these findings are useful for making predictions and planning health care at the individual level."
https://openalex.org/W2059036742,"Lupus nephritis is characterized by deposition of chromatin fragment-IgG complexes in the mesangial matrix and glomerular basement membranes (GBM). The latter defines end-stage disease. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPALS: In the present study we determined the impact of antibodies to dsDNA, renal Dnase1 and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) mRNA levels and enzyme activities on early and late events in murine lupus nephritis. The major focus was to analyse if these factors were interrelated, and if changes in their expression explain basic processes accounting for lupus nephritis.Early phases of nephritis were associated with chromatin-IgG complex deposition in the mesangial matrix. A striking observation was that this event correlated with appearance of anti-dsDNA antibodies and mild or clinically silent nephritis. These events preceded down-regulation of renal Dnase1. Later, renal Dnase1 mRNA level and enzyme activity were reduced, while MMP2 mRNA level and enzyme activity increased. Reduced levels of renal Dnase1 were associated in time with deficient fragmentation of chromatin from dead cells. Large fragments were retained and accumulated in GBM. Also, since chromatin fragments are prone to stimulate Toll-like receptors in e.g. dendritic cells, this may in fact explain increased expression of MMPs.These scenarios may explain the basis for deposition of chromatin-IgG complexes in glomeruli in early and late stages of nephritis, loss of glomerular integrity and finally renal failure."
https://openalex.org/W2026982042,"Steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related lipid transfer (START) domains, found in 15 mammalian proteins termed StarD1-StarD15, are lipid-binding domains implicated in the intracellular lipid transport systems. In the present study, we analyzed the lipid ligand and function of StarD7. We found two variable forms of mammalian StarD7, termed StarD7-I and StarD7-II. Unlike StarD7-II, StarD7-I contained a mitochondrial-targeting sequence in its N terminus. Overexpressed StarD7-I tagged with V5/His in HEPA-1 cells was mainly observed in the mitochondria of cells prepared at low cellular density, but it was distributed in the cytoplasm of high density cells. StarD7-II was constantly distributed in the cytoplasm at any cellular density. Endogenous StarD7 in HEPA-1 cells and rat liver was also distributed in both the cytoplasm and the mitochondria. A protease K protection assay indicated that the mitochondrial StarD7 was associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. The purified recombinant StarD7 specifically catalyzed the transfer of PC between lipid vesicles in vitro. Furthermore, the intracellular transport of fluorescent PC that was exogenously incorporated into the mitochondria was increased in cells that overexpressed StarD7-I. These results suggest that StarD7 facilitates the delivery of PC to mitochondria in non-vesicular system."
https://openalex.org/W2039703131,"Chromalveolates are a diverse group of protists that include many ecologically and medically relevant organisms such as diatoms and apicomplexan parasites. They possess plastids generally surrounded by four membranes, which evolved by engulfment of a red alga. Today, most plastid proteins must be imported, but many aspects of protein import into complex plastids are still cryptic. In particular, how proteins cross the third outermost membrane has remained unexplained. We identified a protein in the third outermost membrane of the diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum with properties comparable to those of the Omp85 family. We demonstrate that the targeting route of P. tricornutum Omp85 parallels that of the translocation channel of the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts, Toc75. In addition, the electrophysiological properties are similar to those of the Omp85 proteins involved in protein translocation. This supports the hypothesis that P. tricornutum Omp85 is involved in precursor protein translocation, which would close a gap in the fundamental understanding of the evolutionary origin and function of protein import in secondary plastids."
https://openalex.org/W1987158482,"Severe malarial anemia is the most common syndrome of severe malaria in endemic areas. The pathophysiology of chronic malaria is characterised by a striking degree of abnormal development of erythroid precursors (dyserythropoiesis) and an inadequate erythropoietic response in spite of elevated levels of erythropoietin. The cause of dyserythropoiesis is unclear although it has been suggested that bone-marrow macrophages release cytokines, chemokines or lipo-peroxides after exposure to hemozoin, a crystalloid form of undigested heme moieties from malarial infected erythrocytes, and so inhibit erythropoiesis. However, we have previously shown that hemozoin may directly inhibit erythroid development in vitro and the levels of hemozoin in plasma from patients with malarial anemia and hemozoin within the bone marrow was associated with reduced reticulocyte response. We hypothesized that macrophages may reduce, not enhance, the inhibitory effect of hemozoin on erythropoiesis. In an in vitro model of erythropoiesis, we now show that inhibition of erythroid cell development by hemozoin isolated from P. falciparum is characterised by delayed expression of the erythroid markers and increased apoptosis of progenitor cells. Crucially, macrophages appear to protect erythroid cells from hemozoin, consistent with a direct contribution of hemozoin to the depression of reticulocyte output from the bone marrow in children with malarial anemia. Moreover, hemozoin isolated from P. falciparum in vitro inhibits erythroid development independently of inflammatory mediators by inducing apoptotic pathways that not only involve activation of caspase 8 and cleavage of caspase 3 but also loss of mitochondrial potential. Taken together these data are consistent with a direct effect of hemozoin in inducing apoptosis in developing erythroid cells in malarial anemia. Accumulation of hemozoin in the bone marrow could therefore result in inadequate reticulocytosis in children that have adequate levels of circulating erythropoietin."

Although it has long been suggested that specific transporters are involved in their intestinal absorption and uptake in other tissues, none of their molecular entities have been identified in mammals to date.

When transiently expressed in HEK293 cells, rSNBT1 could transport uracil most efficiently. The transport of uracil mediated by rSNBT1 was sodium-dependent and saturable with a Michaelis constant of 21.2 μm. Thymine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were also transported, but adenine was not.

The present study provides novel insights into the specific transport and metabolism of nucleobases and their analogs for therapeutic use. Nucleosides are essential components of DNA and RNA, the genomic memory devices, and also play pivotal roles as energy sources and in signal transductions (1.Zöllner N. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 1982; 41: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 2.Burnstock G. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 659-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). In mammals, nucleosides can be synthesized via the de novo pathway from small precursor molecules, such as aspartate, glutamine, glycine, and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate, and via the salvage pathway from nucleobases. In the salvage pathway, the supply of nucleobases mainly occurs from extracellular sources, typically those produced by digestion of dietary nucleic acids in the intestinal lumen. There also occurs redistribution of nucleosides/nucleobases via bloodstream from the tissues that are highly active in de novo synthesizing and/or degrading nucleosides. Therefore, carrier-mediated transport systems are needed for the efficient trafficking across cellular membranes of nucleosides and nucleobases, which are hydrophilic and hence can little permeate otherwise (3.Plagemann P.G. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 405-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 4.de Koning H. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The transporters involved in the cellular uptake of nucleosides have been well characterized in mammals, including humans (5.Gray J.H. Owen R.P. Giacomini K.M.

There are two families of transporters, which are sodium-coupled concentrative nucleoside transporters (CNT1/SLC28A1, CNT2/SLC28A2, and CNT3/SLC28A3) and equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT1/SLC29A1 and ENT2/SLC29A2). All the members of these transporter families transport nucleosides preferentially, playing roles in maintaining their extracellular and intracellular levels coordinately. In particular, CNT1, which transports pyrimidine nucleosides more preferentially than purine nucleosides, is highly expressed in the epithelial tissues such as small intestine, kidney, and liver (8.Huang Q.Q.

It is also known that CNT1 is localized at the apical membrane of intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting its physiological and pharmacological roles in the absorption of nucleosides and their analogs in the small intestine. However, transporters specific for nucleobases have not been identified in mammals, although their presence has long been postulated (3.Plagemann P.G. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys.

Our earlier study using the everted sacs of the rat small intestine demonstrated that the uptake transport of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), 2The abbreviations used are: 5-FU5-fluorouracilrSNBT1rat SNBT1hSNBT1human SNBT1SVCTsodium-dependent ascorbate transporterCNTconcentrative nucleoside transporterENTequilibrative nucleoside transporterNATnucleobase-ascorbate transporterGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinBBMVbrush border membrane vesicleHEKhuman embryonic kidneyMDCKMadin-Darby canine kidneyPBSphosphate-buffered salineRTreverse transcriptionwtwwet tissue weight. a uracil analog used for cancer chemotherapy, occurs in a saturable and sodium-dependent manner and is inhibited by uracil and thymine, but not by their nucleosides, suggesting the involvement of a sodium-dependent transporter specific for nucleobases (16.Yuasa H. Matsuhisa E. Watanabe J. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1996; 19: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Such sodium-dependent transport has also been reported for 5-FU in the rat small intestine by another study using excised tissue rings (12.Bronk J.R. Hastewell J.G. J. Physiol. 1987; 382: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and for hypoxanthine in the calf small intestine by a study using brush border membrane vesicles (17.Theisinger A. Grenacher B. Scharrer E. J. Comp. Physiol. B. 2003; 173: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that sodium-dependent transporters specific for nucleobases are present in the small intestine and, possibly, also in other tissues. In analogy to the situation of nucleosides, equilibrative transporters would also exist for nucleobases (3.Plagemann P.G. Wohlhueter R.M. Woffendin C. Biochim. Biophys.

Although no nucleobase transporter has been identified in mammals, several nucleobase transporters have been identified and well characterized in lower organisms, such as bacteria (18.Andersen P.S.

Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). They have been categorized into three families of nucleobase-ascorbate transporter (NAT), microbial purine-related transporter, and plant purine-related transporter, based on their molecular and functional characteristics (4.de Koning H. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 17: 75-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). According to bioinformatic analysis, mammals have only one such family of transporters. That is the SLC23 family, of which the members are homologous to NATs (27.Takanaga H. Mackenzie B. Hediger M.A. Pflugers Arch. 2004; 447: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28.Gournas C. Papageorgiou I. Diallinas G. Mol. Biosyst. 2008; 4: 404-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). SLC23 family has four members and includes SVCT1/SLC23A1 and SVCT2/SLC23A2, which are well characterized as sodium-dependent ascorbate transporters (SVCTs) and interestingly do not have any transport activity for nucleobases (29.Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F. Hediger M.A. Nature. 1999; 399: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). SLC23A3 is an orphan transporter with unknown function. This putative transporter, which was cloned before the discoveries of SVCT1/SLC23A1 and SVCT2/SLC23A2, has been reported not to accept nucleobases or ascorbate as substrates (30.Guimarães M.J. Bazan J.F. Zlotnik A. Wiles M.V. Grimaldi J.C. Lee F McClanahan T. Development. 1995; 121: 3335-3346PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Faaland C.A. Race J.E. Ricken G. Warner F.J. Williams W.J. Holtzman E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1442: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Another member of the family has been bioinformatically identified and referred to as SLC23A4. The scarce appearance of its expressed sequence tag in humans in the GenBankTM data base may indicate its only poor or insignificant expression in humans and, in fact, its functional characterization as a solute carrier has not been achieved so far. We, however, found by data base search that SLC23A4 may be expressed in rats. This finding prompted us to clone rat Slc23a4 and examine its possible role as a nucleobase transporter. Here we describe our successful attempt to clone Slc23a4 from the rat small intestine and characterize it as a sodium-dependent transporter specific for some nucleobases, typically, uracil, thymine, guanine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine. We also assessed its physiological role by examining its activity in the rat small intestine. Because this transporter is the first one of that kind, we herein refer to it as sodium-dependent nucleobase transporter 1 (SNBT1). It is also notable that this transporter, rat SNBT1 (rSNBT1)/Slc23a4, is the first nucleobase transporter identified in mammals. Furthermore, it was found that the gene orthologous to the rSNBT1 gene is genetically defective in humans, suggesting a possibility that its function may have been evolutionarily lost in humans and, possibly, also in other higher primates. [3H]Uracil (42.8 Ci/mmol), [3H]adenine (25.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]hypoxanthine (27.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]thymidine (20.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]thymine (65.0 Ci/mmol), [3H]uridine (14.7 Ci/mmol), and [3H]xanthine (12.8 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA), [14C]inulin (1.9 mCi/g) and [14C]guanine (55 mCi/mmol) were from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO), and [14C]ascorbate (8.5 mCi/mmol) and [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Uracil and nitrobenzylthioinosine were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan), and phlorizin, papaverine, and dipyridamole were from Sigma-Aldrich. Culture medium was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals, and fetal bovine serum was from Invitrogen. Restriction enzymes were obtained from Toyobo (Osaka, Japan). All other reagents were of analytical grade and commercially obtained. HEK293 cells and MDCKII cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. We conducted a BLAST search of rat nucleotide collection in the GenBank data base, using the amino acid sequence of UpaA, a uracil permease in Aspergillus nidulans, as a query, and identified two cDNA sequences that encode hypothetical proteins with unknown function, XM_231601 and XM_001067886, which had been predicted by computational analysis of the rat genome. However, they seemed to lack the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, respectively, in the deduced amino acid sequences. We therefore deduced the cDNA sequence of a putative open reading frame that has start and stop codons by aligning them. Thus, deduced cDNA, which was identified to be of rat Slc23a4 and in the present study designated to be rSNBT1 to represent its function as a sodium-dependent nucleobase transporter, was cloned by reverse transcription (RT) and subsequent PCR from total RNA prepared from the small intestine of male Wistar rats by a guanidine isothiocyanate extraction method (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63232) Google Scholar). In brief, an RT reaction was carried out to obtain cDNA mixture, using 1 μg of the total RNA, an oligo(dT) primer, and ReverTra Ace (Toyobo) as a reverse transcriptase. The coding region of rSNBT1 cDNA was amplified by PCR using KOD plus polymerase (Toyobo) and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-TCC AGT TGC CAT GAA CTC TG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAC TGT GTG TTC ACC ACG GTA-3′. PCR was performed using the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min; 33 cycles of 1) 94 °C for 20 s, 2) 56 °C for 20 s, and 3) 72 °C for 2 min. The second PCR was performed using the PCR product as a template and a forward primer containing a XhoI restriction site (underlined), 5′-ATT CTC GAG CTA TGA ACT CTG CAG TCT GCA-3′, and a reverse primer containing an XbaI restriction site (underlined), 5′-GGT CTA GAG TTT TGC ATT TTG CAG GC-3′. Then the amplified product was introduced at the XhoI and XbaI sites into a mammalian expression vector, pCI-neo (Promega, Madison, WI). The sequence of the amplified cDNA product was determined with an automated sequencer (ABI PRISM 3100; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The plasmid for green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged rSNBT1 (GFP-rSNBT1) was generated by transferring the coding region of rSNBT1 into pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech) at the XhoI and XbaI sites. The tissue distribution of rSNBT1 transcripts in the rat was examined by Northern blots of total RNA samples, as described previously (33.Ohta K.Y. Inoue K. Hayashi Y. Yuasa H. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 1868-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), using rSNBT1-specific cDNA probe. The 28 S rRNA was stained with ethidium bromide and used as a reference. Total RNA isolated from various rat tissues was used for cDNA synthesis. PCR reactions for rSNBT1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as a reference to confirm the reverse transcription reaction from the cDNAs were performed using TaqDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Japan, Tokyo, Japan) and the following primers: forward primer for rSNBT1, 5′-CCC CTG ACC CAA AGC TAC C-3′; reverse primer for rSNBT1, 5′-AAC ATG CCT CCA ATC ACG G-3′; forward primer for GAPDH, 5′-CCA TCA CCA TCT TCC AGG AG-3′; reverse primer for GAPDH, 5′-CCT GCT TCA CCA CCT TCT TG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles (rSNBT1) or 30 cycles (GAPDH) of 1) 94 °C for 20 s, 2) 60 °C for 20 s, and 3) 72 °C for 40 s. The human genomic DNA was isolated from HEK293 cells by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The purified genomic DNA and cDNAs from human small intestine total RNA (BioChain, Hayward, CA) were subjected to PCR using KOD FX DNA polymerase (Toyobo). The primers were as described above for GAPDH and as follows for hSNBT1: forward primer, 5′-ATG GTC ACT TCC TGT GTC CGG-3′; reverse primer, 5′-GAG ATC CCC ACG GCA GTG ATG-3′. PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles (hSNBT1) or 30 cycles (GAPDH) of 1) 94 °C for 20 s, 2) 60 °C for 20 s, and 3) 68 °C for 6 min (hSNBT1 from genomic DNA), 60 s (hSNBT1 from cDNAs), or 30 s (GAPDH). PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel. HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid carrying rSNBT1 cDNA by using HilyMax (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) as a transfection reagent, as described in our previous report (34.Yamamoto S. Inoue K. Ohta K.Y. Fukatsu R. Maeda J.Y. Yoshida Y. Yuasa H. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Transport assays were conducted as described in the same report. In brief, cells in each well of 24-well plates were preincubated for 5 min in 1.5 ml of substrate-free uptake buffer consisting of 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.4 mm KH2PO4, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 25 mm glucose, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and then transport assays were started by replacing the substrate-free uptake buffer with one containing a radiolabeled substrate (0.25 ml). All the procedures were conducted at 37 °C. Assays were stopped by the addition of ice-cold substrate-free uptake buffer (2 ml), and the cells were washed twice with 2 ml of the same buffer. The cells were solubilized, and the associated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting, using Clear-sol I (Nakarai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) as a scintillation fluid for the evaluation of uptake. Cellular protein content was determined by the method of Lowry et al. (35.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The specific uptake of each substrate by rSNBT1 was estimated by subtracting the uptake in mock cells, which were transfected with empty pCI-neo vector, from that in rSNBT1-transfected cells. MDCKII cells were transfected with the plasmid carrying the cDNA of GFP-rSNBT1, using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) as a transfection reagent, and Geneticin-resistant clones were selected as described previously (36.Nakai Y. Inoue K. Abe N. Hatakeyama M. Ohta K.Y. Otagiri M. Hayashi Y. Yuasa H. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 322: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The expression of GFP-rSNBT1 was confirmed by fluorescence from GFP-rSNBT1 and transport of [3H]uracil. To examine the localization of GFP-rSNBT1, MDCKII cells stably expressing GFP-rSNBT1 were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 cells on a polycarbonate membrane insert of Transwell and grown to confluence for 5 days. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were incubated for 10 min at room temperature with 1 μm 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole in PBS to stain the nuclei. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then mounted on a glass slide in 9:1 glycerol/PBS. GFP-rSNBT1 and 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole-stained nuclei were visualized by using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Everted tissue sacs were prepared from the small intestine of male Wistar rats, weighing ∼300 g and not fasted, and uptake experiments were conducted, as reported previously (37.Inoue K. Nakai Y. Ueda S. Kamigaso S. Ohta K.Y. Hatakeyama M. Hayashi Y. Otagiri M. Yuasa H. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2008; 294: G660-G668Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In brief, the everted sacs (2 cm in length) were preincubated for 5 min in substrate-free uptake buffer, that is Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate buffer (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 25 mm NaHCO3) supplemented with 20 mm HEPES and oxygenated with 95% O2, 5% CO2 gas (pH 7.4), and then placed in uptake buffer containing [3H]uracil and [14C]inulin as a non-absorbable marker for the initiation of incubation for uptake. All the incubations were carried out at a temperature of 37 °C and a shaking rate of 100 strokes/min. Uptake was terminated by rinsing the everted sacs briefly with ice-cold saline, and the uptake into the tissue was evaluated by determining the radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting after solubilization of the tissue sample, using 1 ml of Soluene-350 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as a tissue solubilizer and 5 ml of Clear-sol I as a scintillation fluid. The experiments were conducted with the approval of the Animal Experiment Ethics Committee of Nagoya City University Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences. The saturable transport of each substrate, uracil and xanthine, by rSNBT1 was analyzed by assuming Michaelis-Menten type carrier-mediated transport represented by the following equation: v = Vmax × s/(Km + s). The maximum transport rate (Vmax) and the Michaelis constant (Km) were estimated by fitting this equation to the experimental profile of the uptake rate (v) versus the substrate concentration (s), using a non-linear least-squares regression analysis program, WinNonlin (Pharsight Corp., Mountain View, CA) and the reciprocal of variance as the weight. Stoichiometric coupling between Na+ and uracil was analyzed by using the following Hill equation: v = Vmax,s × [Na+]n/(KNan + [Na+]n). The Hill coefficient (n) was estimated together with the maximum transport rate of uracil at its specified concentration (Vmax,s) and the Na+ concentration that gives half-Vmax,s (KNa) by fitting this equation to the experimental profile of v versus the Na+ concentration in the extracellular medium ([Na+]). The v in the presence of an inhibitor can be expressed as follows: v = v0/(1 + i/IC50). The half-inhibition concentration (IC50) was estimated by fitting this equation to the experimental profile of v versus the inhibitor concentration (i), with v in the absence of inhibitors (v0) fixed at the observed value. In the analysis of uracil transport in the rat small intestine, v was converted to the uptake clearance (CLup) by dividing by s, and the clearance of passive transport by simple diffusion (CLm,d) was added as an additional parameter to be estimated to account for a non-saturable transport component as follows: CLup = Vmax/(Km + s) + CLm,d. A plot of CLupversus logarithmic concentration was used to handle uptake data as it was more suitable for a wider concentration range that was needed in the data analysis.

The uptake rates (pmol/min/mg of protein) for unity, which were evaluated in mock cells, were 0.0546 for adenine, 21.5 for guanine, 0.163 for hypoxanthine, 0.0370 for xanthine, 0.0172 for thymine, 0.00740 for uracil, 0.257 for thymidine, 0.170 for uridine, and 19.8 for ascorbate.

https://openalex.org/W2132496832,"Recent work indicates that allelic incompatibility in the mouse PRDM9 (Meisetz) gene can cause hybrid male sterility, contributing to genetic isolation and potentially speciation. The only phenotype of mouse PRDM9 knockouts is a meiosis I block that causes sterility in both sexes. The PRDM9 gene encodes a protein with histone H3(K4) trimethyltransferase activity, a KRAB domain, and a DNA-binding domain consisting of multiple tandem C2H2 zinc finger (ZF) domains. We have analyzed human coding polymorphism and interspecies evolutionary changes in the PRDM9 gene. The ZF domains of PRDM9 are evolving very rapidly, with compelling evidence of positive selection in primates. Positively selected amino acids are predominantly those known to make nucleotide specific contacts in C2H2 zinc fingers. These results suggest that PRDM9 is subject to recurrent selection to change DNA-binding specificity. The human PRDM9 protein is highly polymorphic in its ZF domains and nearly all polymorphisms affect the same nucleotide contact residues that are subject to positive selection. ZF domain nucleotide sequences are strongly homogenized within species, indicating that interfinger recombination contributes to their evolution. PRDM9 has previously been assumed to be a transcription factor required to induce meiosis specific genes, a role that is inconsistent with its molecular evolution. We suggest instead that PRDM9 is involved in some aspect of centromere segregation conflict and that rapidly evolving centromeric DNA drives changes in PRDM9 DNA-binding domains."
https://openalex.org/W2128053182,"Leucocyte activating chemokines such as CCL2, CCL3, and CXCL8 together with proinflammatory IFNgamma, TNFalpha and downmodulatory IL10 play a central role in the restriction of M. tuberculosis infections, but is unclear whether these markers are indicative of tuberculosis disease severity.We investigated live M. tuberculosis- and M. bovis BCG-induced peripheral blood mononuclear cell responses in patients with tuberculosis (TB) and healthy endemic controls (ECs, n = 36). TB patients comprised pulmonary (PTB, n = 34) and extrapulmonary groups, subdivided into those with less severe localized extrapulmonary TB (L-ETB, n = 16) or severe disseminated ETB (D-ETB, n = 16). Secretion of CCL2, IFNgamma, IL10 and CCL3, and mRNA expression of CCL2, TNFalpha, CCL3 and CXCL8 were determined.M. tuberculosis- and BCG-induced CCL2 secretion was significantly increased in both PTB and D-ETB (p<0.05, p<0.01) as compared with L-ETB patients. CCL2 secretion in response to M. tuberculosis was significantly greater than to BCG in the PTB and D-ETB groups. M. tuberculosis-induced CCL2 mRNA transcription was greater in PTB than L-ETB (p = 0.023), while CCL2 was reduced in L-ETB as compared with D-ETB (p = 0.005) patients. M. tuberculosis-induced IFNgamma was greater in L-ETB than PTB (p = 0.04), while BCG-induced IFNgamma was greater in L-ETB as compared with D-ETB patients (p = 0.036). TNFalpha mRNA expression was raised in PTB as compared with L-ETB group in response to M. tuberculosis (p = 0.02) and BCG (p = 0.03). Mycobacterium-induced CCL3 and CXCL8 was comparable between TB groups.The increased CCL2 and TNFalpha in PTB patients may support effective leucocyte recruitment and M. tuberculosis localization. CCL2 alone is associated with severity of TB, possibly due to increased systemic inflammation found in severe disseminated TB or due to increased monocyte infiltration to lung parenchyma in pulmonary disease."
https://openalex.org/W2149156550,"To estimate the frequency, molecular epidemiological and clinical associations of infection with the newly described species C variants of human rhinoviruses (HRV), 3243 diagnostic respiratory samples referred for diagnostic testing in Edinburgh were screened using a VP4-encoding region-based selective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HRV-C along with parallel PCR testing for 13 other respiratory viruses. HRV-C was the third most frequently detected behind respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and adenovirus, with 141 infection episodes detected among 1885 subjects over 13 months (7.5%). Infections predominantly targeted the very young (median age 6–12 months; 80% of infections in those <2 years), occurred throughout the year but with peak incidence in early winter months. HRV-C was detected significantly more frequently among subjects with lower (LRT) and upper respiratory tract (URT) disease than controls without respiratory symptoms; HRV-C mono-infections were the second most frequently detected virus (behind RSV) in both disease presentations (6.9% and 7.8% of all cases respectively). HRV variants were classified by VP4/VP2 sequencing into 39 genotypically defined types, increasing the current total worldwide to 60. Through sequence comparisons of the 5′untranslated region (5′UTR), the majority grouped with species A (n = 96; 68%, described as HRV-Ca), the remainder forming a phylogenetically distinct 5′UTR group (HRV-Cc). Multiple and bidirectional recombination events between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants and with HRV species A represents the most parsimonious explanation for their interspersed phylogeny relationships in the VP4/VP2-encoding region. No difference in age distribution, seasonality or disease associations was identified between HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc variants. HRV-C-infected subjects showed markedly reduced detection frequencies of RSV and other respiratory viruses, providing evidence for a major interfering effect of HRV-C on susceptibility to other respiratory virus infections. HRV-C's disease associations, its prevalence and evidence for interfering effects on other respiratory viruses mandates incorporation of rhinoviruses into future diagnostic virology screening."
https://openalex.org/W2032735655,"Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite belonging to the phylum Apicomplexa. Parasites in this phylum utilize a unique process of motility termed gliding, which is dependent on parasite actin filaments. Surprisingly, 98% of parasite actin is maintained as G-actin, suggesting that filaments are rapidly assembled and turned over. Little is known about the regulated disassembly of filaments in the Apicomplexa. In higher eukaryotes, the related actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) and cofilin proteins are essential regulators of actin filament turnover. ADF is one of the few actin-binding proteins conserved in apicomplexan parasites. In this study we examined the mechanism by which T. gondii ADF (TgADF) regulates actin filament turnover. Unlike other members of the ADF/cofilin (AC) family, apicomplexan ADFs lack key F-actin binding sites. Surprisingly, this promotes their enhanced disassembly of actin filaments. Restoration of the C-terminal F-actin binding site to TgADF stabilized its interaction with filaments but reduced its net filament disassembly activity. Analysis of severing activity revealed that TgADF is a weak severing protein, requiring much higher concentrations than typical AC proteins. Investigation of TgADF interaction with T. gondii actin (TgACT) revealed that TgADF disassembled short TgACT oligomers. Kinetic and steady-state polymerization assays demonstrated that TgADF has strong monomer-sequestering activity, inhibiting TgACT polymerization at very low concentrations. Collectively these data indicate that TgADF promoted the efficient turnover of actin filaments via weak severing of filaments and strong sequestering of monomers. This suggests a dual role for TgADF in maintaining high G-actin concentrations and effecting rapid filament turnover."

NHERF1 is held in an autoinhibited state through intramolecular interactions between PDZ2 and the CT domain that also includes a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif (-SNL). We have determined the structures of the isolated and tandem PDZ2CT domains by high resolution NMR using small angle x-ray scattering as constraints. The PDZ2CT structure shows weak intramolecular interactions between the largely disordered CT domain and the PDZ ligand binding site. The structure reveals a novel helix-turn-helix subdomain that is allosterically coupled to the putative PDZ2 domain by a network of hydrophobic interactions. This helical subdomain increases both the stability and the binding affinity of the extended PDZ structure. Using NMR and small angle neutron scattering for joint structure refinement, we demonstrate the release of intramolecular domain-domain interactions in PDZ2CT upon binding to ezrin. Based on the structural information, we show that human disease-causing mutations in PDZ2, R153Q and E225K, have significantly reduced protein stability.

https://openalex.org/W2070127940,"Background Protein aggregation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease. However, direct real-time imaging of protein aggregation, including oligomerization and fibrillization, has never been achieved. Here we demonstrate the preparation of fluorescent semiconductor nanocrystal (quantum dot; QD)-labeled amyloid-β peptide (QDAβ) and its advanced applications. Methodology/Principal Findings The QDAβ construct retained Aβ oligomer-forming ability, and the sizes of these oligomers could be estimated from the relative fluorescence intensities of the imaged spots. Both QDAβ coaggregation with intact Aβ42 and insertion into fibrils were detected by fluorescence microscopy. The coaggregation process was observed by real-time 3D imaging using slit-scanning confocal microscopy, which showed a typical sigmoid curve with 1.5 h in the lag-time and 12 h until saturation. Inhibition of coaggregation using an anti-Aβ antibody can be observed as 3D images on a microscopic scale. Microglia ingested monomeric QDAβ more significantly than oligomeric QDAβ, and the ingested QDAβ was mainly accumulated in the lysosome. Conclusions/Significance These data demonstrate that QDAβ is a novel nanoprobe for studying Aβ oligomerization and fibrillization in multiple modalities and may be applicable for high-throughput drug screening systems."
https://openalex.org/W2088632182,"The cortical actin cytoskeleton beneath the plasma membrane represents a physical barrier that vaccinia virus has to overcome during its exit from an infected cell. Previous observations using overexpression and pharmacological approaches suggest that vaccinia enhances its release by modulating the cortical actin cytoskeleton by inhibiting RhoA signalling using the viral protein F11. We have now examined the role of F11 and its ability to interact with RhoA to inhibit its downstream signalling in the spread of vaccinia infection both in vitro and in vivo. Live cell imaging over 48 hours reveals that loss of F11 or its ability to bind RhoA dramatically reduces the rate of cell-to-cell spread of the virus in a cell monolayer. Cells infected with the ΔF11L virus also maintained their cell-to-cell contacts, and did not undergo virus-induced motility as observed during wild-type infections. The ΔF11L virus is also attenuated in intranasal mouse models of infection, as it is impaired in its ability to spread from the initial sites of infection to the lungs and spleen. Loss of the ability of F11 to bind RhoA also reduces viral spread in vivo. Our results clearly establish that viral-mediated inibition of RhoA signalling can enhance the spread of infection not only in cell monolayers, but also in vivo."

Walker G.C. Siede W. Wood R.D. Schultz R.A. Ellenberger T. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. 2nd Ed. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.2006Google Scholar). NER can be grouped into two pathways: global genomic repair (GGR), which refers to repair throughout the genome, and transcription coupled repair (TCR), which refers to a repair mechanism that is dedicated to the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes (2.Hanawalt P.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 8949-8956Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rad7, Rad16 (3.Verhage R. Zeeman A.M. de Groot N. Gleig F. Bang D.D. van de Putte P.

Elc1 has been shown to be a component of a ubiquitin ligase that contains Rad7 and Rad16, and is responsible for regulating the levels of Rad4 protein in response to UV damage (6.Gillette T.G. Yu S.

The mechanistic details of TCR are relatively well understood in Escherichia coli.

However, TCR in yeast is not solely dependent on Rad26, as a substantial extent of TCR still occurs in cells lacking Rad26 (22.Li S. Smerdon M.J.

Mutations in the SPT4 and SPT5 genes in yeast were originally isolated as suppressors of the Ty insertion mutations that interfere with adjacent gene transcription (27.Winston F. Chaleff D.T. Valent B. Fink G.R. Genetics. 1984; 107: 179-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the Ty sequence is inserted in the upstream region of a gene, the transcription signal directs transcription from the Ty promoter and interferes with normal transcription of the adjacent gene. A mutation in SPT4 or SPT5 attenuates the aberrant transcription, restoring transcription from the normal site. The SPT4 gene is dispensable (28.Malone E.A. Fassler J.S. Winston F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the SPT5 gene is essential (29.Swanson M.S. Malone E.A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) for cell viability. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that Spt4 and Spt5 form a complex, which physically interacts with Pol II (30.Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Yeast cells lacking Spt4 show reduced efficiency of Pol II elongation through GC-rich DNA sequences and a general decrease in Pol II processivity (31.Mason P.B. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 831-840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 32.Rondón A.G. García-Rubio M. González-Barrera S. Aguilera A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). These proteins are conserved eukaryotic transcription-elongation factors and are generally required for normal development and viral gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes (33.Winston F. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS1006)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the Spt4-Spt5 complex, which is also called DRB sensitivity inducing factor, and represses transcription elongation at the early elongation-recessive elongation transition (34.Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H.

Phosphorylation of the C-terminal repeat region of Spt5 plays a key role in converting the complex from a repressor to a positive regulator of transcription (36.Yamada T. Yamaguchi Y. Inukai N. Okamoto S. Mura T. Handa H. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 227-237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 37.Zhu W. Wada T. Okabe S. Taneda T. Yamaguchi Y. Handa H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 4064-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was shown that deletion of spt4 alleviates the requirement of Rad26 for TCR in yeast, indicating that Spt4 suppresses Rad26-independent TCR (38.Jansen L.E. den Dulk H. Brouns R.M. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Brouwer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6498-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Until now, whether and/or how Spt5 is involved in the suppression is unclear. Like the spt4 deletion, an Spt5 point mutation, spt5–194, results in the Spt− phenotype (i.e. unable to suppress Ty insertion mutations) and is sensitive to the nucleotide depletion drug 6-azauracil, indicating that spt4 deletion and spt5–194 mutation may cause similar deficiencies in transcription elongation (30.Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 39.Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, spt5–194 combined with an spt4 mutation leads to synthetic lethality (39.Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, unlike spt4Δ, the spt5–194 mutation does not suppress UV sensitivity of rad16Δ rad26Δ cells (38.Jansen L.E. den Dulk H. Brouns R.M. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Brouwer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6498-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This observation led to the proposition that, unlike Spt4, Spt5 may not play a role in suppressing Rad26-independent TCR or that, despite the shared phenotypes with spt4Δ, the specific spt5–194 mutation may not lead to a defect in the suppression. In this paper, we present evidence that Spt4 indirectly suppresses Rad26-independent TCR by protecting Spt5 from degradation and stabilizing the interaction of Spt5 with Pol II. We further found that the C-terminal repeat (CTR) domain of Spt5, which contains 15 copies of a 6-amino acid sequence that can be phosphorylated by the Bur kinase, plays an important role in suppressing Rad26-independent TCR. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Wild type yeast strain BJ5465 (MATa ura3–52 trp1 leu2Δ1 his3Δ200 pep4::HIS3 prb1Δ1.6R can1) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). URA3, LEU2, and KanMX were used to replace the gene to be deleted. In some cases, the URA3 gene that had replaced a gene was further knocked-out as described previously (22.Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar).

Open table in a new tab A plasmid overexpressing 3xFLAG-tagged Spt5 under control of the GAL10 promoter was created using vector pESC-URA (Fig. 2A). Two consecutive FLAG sequences were inserted in-frame downstream of the FLAG sequence (downstream of the GAL10 promoter) present in the original pESC-URA vector to create a vector encoding 3xFLAG. The SPT5 gene coding sequence was amplified by PCR and inserted in-frame downstream of the 3xFLAG sequence to create plasmid pGAL-SPT5 (Fig. 2A). A single-copy centromeric plasmid with the URA3 gene as a selection marker and encoding the wild type Spt5 protein was created by using the plasmid pRS416 (41.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length of the SPT5 gene encompassing the 5′ promoter, the coding region, and the 3′ terminator was amplified by PCR and inserted between BamHI and EagI sites of pRS416 to create plasmid pRS416-SPT5. A single-copy centromeric plasmid with the LEU2 gene as a selection marker and encoding the full-length or truncated Spt5 proteins were created by using plasmid pRS415 (Fig. 4, A and B) (41.Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The promoter, full-length or truncated coding sequences, and the terminator of the SPT5 gene, and the 3 consecutive Myc sequences (3xMyc) were amplified by PCR and ligated into pRS415 to create plasmids expressing the full-length or CTR-deleted Spt5 (Fig. 4B). Yeast cells were transformed with plasmid pRS416-SPT5 and the genomic SPT5 gene was then deleted using a standard procedure as described above. The specific deletion of the genomic SPT5 gene was confirmed by PCR using primer pairs specific for the genomic SPT5 gene and the plasmid-borne SPT5 gene. pRS415-based plasmids encoding the full-length or truncated Spt5 were transformed into the yeast cells whose genomic SPT5 gene had been deleted and complemented with pRS416-SPT5. The transformed cells were cultured in medium containing uracil but not leucine to select the LEU2 plasmids and allow the loss of the URA3 plasmid. A centromeric plasmid generally has a loss rate of 1% per generation and shows virtually no segregation bias (42.Lundblad V. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2004: 13.4.1-13.4.10Google Scholar). The cultures were then spotted onto plates containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA), which is toxic to cells with a functional URA3 gene (43.Boeke J.D. LaCroute F. Fink G.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1984; 197: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1712) Google Scholar), to select for cells that had lost plasmid pRS416-SPT5. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose (SD) or 2% galactose (SG, for Spt5 overexpression) to late log phase (A600 ≈ 1.0), irradiated with 80 J/m2 of 254 nm UV and incubated in YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract and 2% glucose) or YPG medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract and 2% galactose) in the dark at 30 °C. At different times of the repair incubation, aliquots were removed and the genomic DNA was isolated using a hot SDS procedure as described previously (22.Li S. Smerdon M.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5921-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The gene fragments of interest were 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]dATP using a procedure described previously (44.Li S. Waters R. Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17: 1549-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 45.Li S. Waters R. Smerdon M.J. Methods. 2000; 22: 170-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼1 μg of total genomic DNA was digested with restriction enzyme(s) to release the fragments of interest and incised at CPD sites with an excess amount of T4 endonuclease V (Epicentre). Excess copies of biotinylated oligonucleotides, which are complementary to the 3′-end of the fragments to be labeled, were mixed with the sample. The mixture was heated at 95 °C for 5 min to denature the DNA and then cooled to an annealing temperature of around 50 °C. The annealed fragments were attached to streptavidin magnetic beads (Invitrogen), labeled with [α-32P]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and resolved on sequencing gels. The gels were exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Bio-Rad). The signal intensities at gel bands corresponding to CPD sites were quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Yeast cells were cultured at 30 °C in minimal medium containing 2% glucose or galactose (to induce a gene under the control of the GAL10 promoter) to late log phase and harvested. For measuring cellular levels of proteins of interest, whole cell extracts were prepared using a trichloroacetic acid method (46.Chen X. Ruggiero C. Li S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4617-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The harvested cells from a 5-ml culture were resuspended in 300 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid and broken by vertexing them with acid-washed glass beads. The proteins in the lysates were pelleted by centrifugation, washed with ice-cold 80% acetone, and dissolved in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer (47.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). To examine the effect of Spt4 on Spt5 degradation, spt4Δ and SPT4+ cells expressing 3xFLAG-tagged Spt5 were cultured to late log phase. Cycloheximide (CHX), a potent protein synthesis inhibitor (48.Schindler D. Davies J. Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 12: 17-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was added to the cultures to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml to completely stop protein synthesis (46.Chen X. Ruggiero C. Li S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4617-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). At different times following the addition of CHX, cells were harvested and whole cell extracts were prepared using the trichloroacetic acid method as described above. For immunoprecipitation, the harvested cells from a 25-ml culture were washed with and resupended in 0.5 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.4 mm Na4VO3, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) (46.Chen X. Ruggiero C. Li S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 4617-4625Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The cells were broken with acid-washed glass beads, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Fifty μl of the lysate was saved as an “input.” The remaining lysate was added with 15 μg of anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma), anti-Myc (Sigma), 8WG16 (Neoclone), or H14 (Covance) antibodies, which recognize FLAG tag peptide, Myc tag peptide, the hypophosphorylated and hyperphosphorylated C-terminal heptapeptide repeats of Rpb1, respectively (49.Palancade B. Bensaude O. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 3859-3870Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight with gentle rotation. Protein A- or G-coated agarose beads (Sigma) were added to the mixture and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h with gentle rotation. The beads were washed twice with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl and twice with immunoprecipitation buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer. Pol II complex was immunoprecipitated from yeast cells using antibody H14 as described above. Protein A- or G-coated agarose beads attached with the immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 100 μl of dephosphorylation reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-35, 1 mm MnCl2). Four hundred units of λ protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs) were added to the sample. Following 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE gel loading buffer was added to the sample. Proteins were eluted from the beads by boiling for 5 min. Proteins in whole cell extracts, immunoprecipitation inputs, immunoprecipitated samples, or phosphatase-treated samples were resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P; Millipore). Rpb1 was probed with 8WG16 or H14 antibodies. 3xFLAG- and 3xMyc-tagged proteins were probed with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-Myc antibody (Sigma), respectively. Blots were incubated with SuperSignal® West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate (Pierce), and the protein bands were detected using a chemiluminescence scanner (Fluorchem 8800, Alpha Innotech). Band intensities were quantified using AlphaEaseFC 4.0 software. Yeast cells were cultured to late log phase under the same conditions as those used for NER analysis. Total RNA was isolated using a hot acidic phenol method, as described (50.Collart M.A. Oliviero S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York2004: 13.12.1-13.12.5Google Scholar). The RNA was fractionated on formaldehyde-agarose gels (47.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar), transferred onto Hybond-N+ membranes (GE Healthcare), and hybridized with radioactive probes generated using the Prime-It® II Random Primer Labeling Kit (Stratagene). Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in minimal medium to saturation, and sequential 10-fold dilutions were made. The diluted samples were spotted onto YPD plates. When the spots had dried, the plates were irradiated with different doses of 254 nm UV light. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 3–7 days in the dark prior to being photographed. It has been shown that Spt4 partially suppresses Rad26-independent TCR, as deletion of SPT4 reinstates TCR in rad26Δ cells (38.Jansen L.E. den Dulk H. Brouns R.M. de Ruijter M. Brandsma J.A. Brouwer J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6498-6507Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Spt4 forms a complex with Spt5 in yeast (30.Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 39.Swanson M.S. Winston F. Genetics. 1992; 132: 325-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and human cells (34.Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Ferdous A. Imai T. Hirose S. Sugimoto S. Yano K. Hartzog G.A. Winston F. Buratowski S. Handa H. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 343-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). In yeast, the SPT4 gene is dispensable (28.Malone E.A. Fassler J.S. Winston F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 237: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas the SPT5 gene is essential for cell viability (29.Swanson M.S. Malone E.A. Winston F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3009-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). We wondered if Spt4 suppresses Rad26-independent TCR directly or through or together with Spt5. To this end, we first examined if Spt4 affects the cellular level of Spt5. Three consecutive FLAG sequences (3xFLAG) were tagged to the coding sequence of the genomic SPT5 gene in different yeast mutants. The 3xFLAG tag did not cause any noticeable deficiency to the cells (not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, the cellular level of Spt5 in spt4Δ cells was about ⅓ of that in SPT4+ cells, regardless of the presence of the GGR factor Rad7 or the TCR factor Rad26. However, the SPT5 mRNA levels were similar between spt4Δ and SPT4+ cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that the lower cellular level of Spt5 in spt4Δ cells was not caused by a decreased transcription of the SPT5 gene. For an unknown reason, SPT5 mRNA levels were somewhat higher in rad7Δ cells than in RAD7+ cells (Fig. 1B, compare first and second lanes with the third to sixth lanes). We then tested whether Spt5 was degraded faster in spt4Δ cells. The level of Spt5 barely changed in SPT4+ cells during an 8-h incubation after protein synthesis was completely suppressed by the addition of the protein synthesis inhibitor CHX (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, the Spt5 level decreased dramatically in spt4Δ cells under the same incubation conditions (Fig. 1, C and D). These results indicate that Spt4 protects Spt5 from degradation. To test whether overexpression of Spt5 in spt4Δ cells could compensate for the absence of Spt4, we created a multicopy (with 2-μm replication origin) plasmid (pGAL-SPT5) expressing the 3xFLAG-tagged Spt5 under the control of the galactose inducible GAL10 promoter (Fig. 2A). The plasmid was transformed into different yeast mutant strains. Upon galactose induction, the plasmid-encoded 3xFLAG-tagged Spt5 was expressed at cellular levels that were 3–6 times of those of the genomically encoded 3xFLAG-tagged Spt5 (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6). It has been shown that the Spt4-Spt5 complex is associated with Pol II (30.Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 357-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The elongation form of Pol II is hyperphosphorylated at serines 2 and 5 of the C-terminal heptapeptide repeats (Y1S2P3T4S5P6S7) of Rpb1, whereas the non"
https://openalex.org/W2074391996,"A small fraction of dietary protein survives enzymatic degradation and is absorbed in potentially antigenic form. This can trigger inflammatory responses in patients with celiac disease or food allergies, but typically induces systemic immunological tolerance (oral tolerance). At present it is not clear how dietary antigens are absorbed. Most food staples, including those with common antigens such as peanuts, eggs, and milk, contain long-chain triglycerides (LCT), which stimulate mesenteric lymph flux and postprandial transport of chylomicrons through mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and blood. Most dietary antigens, like ovalbumin (OVA), are emulsifiers, predicting affinity for chylomicrons. We hypothesized that chylomicron formation promotes intestinal absorption and systemic dissemination of dietary antigens.Absorption of OVA into MLN and blood was significantly enhanced when OVA was gavaged into fasted mice together with LCT compared with medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), which do not stimulate chylomicron formation. The effect of LCT was blocked by the addition of an inhibitor of chylomicron secretion, Pluronic L-81. Adoptively transferred OVA-specific DO11.10 T-cells proliferated more extensively in peripheral lymph nodes when OVA was gavaged with LCT than with MCT or LCT plus Pluronic L-81, suggesting that dietary OVA is systemically disseminated. Most dietary OVA in plasma was associated with chylomicrons, suggesting that these particles mediate systemic antigen dissemination. Intestinal-epithelial CaCo-2 cells secreted more cell-associated, exogenous OVA when stimulated with oleic-acid than with butyric acid, and the secreted OVA appeared to be associated with chylomicrons.Postprandial chylomicron formation profoundly affects absorption and systemic dissemination of dietary antigens. The fat content of a meal may affect immune responses to dietary antigens by modulating antigen absorption and transport."

We previously identified PfUCHL3, a deubiquitinating enzyme, and here we characterize its activity and changes in active site architecture upon binding to ubiquitin. We find strong evidence that PfUCHL3 is essential to parasite survival. The crystal structures of both PfUCHL3 alone and in complex with the ubiquitin-based suicide substrate UbVME suggest a rather rigid active site crossover loop that likely plays a role in restricting the size of ubiquitin adduct substrates.

The regulation of protein function, localization, or degradation involves the action of specific hydrolases targeting ubiquitin (Ub) 4The abbreviations used are: UbubiquitinNEDD8neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8UCHubiquitin C-terminal hydrolaseDUBdeubiquitinating enzymeVMEvinyl methyl esterVSvinyl sulfoneHAhemagglutininNEMN-ethylmaleimideUBLubiquitin-like proteinPfP. falciparumAMC7-amido-4-methylcoumarinBicineN,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycineUbVMEUb-vinyl methyl esterBis-Tris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolMDmolecular dynamics. and ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) such as Nedd8. For ubiquitin, this family of hydrolases is collectively referred to as deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). Although intracellular apicomplexan parasites require their own self-encoded UBLs for survival, they may also encode agents capable of hijacking host UBL machinery. Although both viruses and bacteria lack the complete Ub machinery of their own, they do encode Ub ligases and proteins with de-ubiquitinating activity, which may be used for interaction with their host, as well as for host-targeted, immune evasion (1.Isaacson M.K. Ploegh H.L. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although there is little direct evidence that the livelihood of eukaryotic parasites is dependent on UBLs, it is axiomatic that they use Ub and other Ub-like modifiers to regulate their physiology. Studies have reported a lethal effect on malaria parasites following treatment with proteasome inhibitors (2.Featherstone C. Mol. Med. Today. 1997; 3: 367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Lindenthal C. Weich N. Chia Y.S. Heussler V. Klinkert M.Q. Parasitology. 2005; 131: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, parasitic UBL-regulating enzymes present interesting candidates for biological manipulation. Components of the Ub cascade have been successfully targeted in the treatment of cancer (4.Sun Y. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 623-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar); although these components have orthologs in parasitic pathogens, they show only moderate identity to their host counterparts, which makes them potential drug targets for apicomplexan-caused diseases such as malaria and toxoplasmosis. Indeed, the susceptibility of Plasmodium to the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and artesunate has been linked to mutations mapping to a DUB locus in the mouse malaria model Plasmodium chabaudi (5.Hunt P.

Furthermore, Ub-conjugating enzymes are up-regulated in the death response of Plasmodium parasites as induced by treatment with antifolates (6.Ganesan K. Ponmee N. Jiang L. Fowble J.W. White J.

Profiling by activity-based UBL probes has facilitated the identification of DUBs, deNeddylases and desumoylating enzymes in a variety of organisms (7.Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Misaghi S. Comeaux C.A.

Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 142-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). PfUCHL3, the Plasmodium ortholog of mammalian UCHL3, was identified as part of such a screen in P. falciparum (10.Frickel E.M. Quesada V. Muething L. Gubbels M.J. Spooner E. Ploegh H. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Endpoint reactions with mammalian-derived UBL probes identified PfUCHL3 as a dual deNeddylase/DUB, consistent with the activity of its mammalian ortholog. Interestingly, a search by sequence homology for known deNeddylases fails to identify orthologs in Plasmodium, with the notable exception of UCHL3. That other non-orthologous enzymes function to remove Nedd8 from target proteins in Plasmodium is plausible (7.Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Misaghi S. Comeaux C.A. Catic A. Spooner E. Duraisingh M.T. Ploegh H.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), but PfUCHL3 may well play a larger and more central role in parasite physiology. Here we characterize PfUCHL3 activity and changes in architecture upon Ub binding. We find strong evidence that PfUCHL3 is essential for parasite survival. To elucidate the structural basis for its dual Ub and Nedd8 specificity, we determined the crystal structures of PfUCHL3 free and in complex with the Ub-based suicide substrate UbVME. Molecular dynamics simulations of the determined structures and a model of the PfUCHL3-PfNedd8 complex identified shared key interactions between Ub/PfNedd8 and PfUCHL3, explaining the dual specificity of this enzyme. Distinct differences in the Ub binding site between PfUCHL3 and its human counterpart suggest that the parasitic DUB can be selectively targeted by inhibitors. Probes were generated as described in a previous study (8.Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). P. falciparum FLAG-Nedd8 could not be expressed in soluble form. Four mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange kit, Stratagene) to exchange hydrophobic residues to glutamines, namely F24Q, M28Q, M54Q, and V62Q. Subsequently, FLAG-PfNedd8-VME was generated as previously described (8.Borodovsky A. Ovaa H. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Ploegh H.L. Kessler B.M. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Briefly, PfFLAGNedd8 was cloned into the pTYB4 vector (New England Biolabs) and expressed as a fusion with a C-terminal intein and chitin binding domains in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL competent cells (Stratagene) and induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Fusions were purified using chitin beads (New England Biolabs), eluted by forcing intein excision with β-mercaptoethane sulfonic acid and subsequently modified in the presence of N-hydroxysuccinimide and glycine-vinyl methyl ester (VME) to yield active probes. PfUCHL3 was previously cloned into pcDNA (10.Frickel E.M. Quesada V. Muething L. Gubbels M.J. Spooner E. Ploegh H. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In vitro coupled transcription/translation was performed in the presence of [35S]cysteine-methionine and reacted with PfFLAGNedd8-VME, HAUb-VME, or MmNedd8-vinyl sulfone (VS) for 2 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of N-ethyl maleimide (NEM). Polypeptides and complexes were visualized by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography as previously described (10.Frickel E.M. Quesada V. Muething L. Gubbels M.J. Spooner E. Ploegh H. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The 3D7 strain of P. falciparum was obtained from the WEHI (Melbourne, Australia), and the 3D7-attB strain was obtained from the Fidock laboratory at Columbia University (New York). Both were maintained in in vitro culture as previously described (23.Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites were cultured in human O+ erythrocytes at 4% hematocrit in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 25 mm HEPES (EMD Biosciences), sodium bicarbonate (Sigma), 50 mg/liter hypoxanthine (Sigma), and 0.5% Albumax II (Invitrogen). The PfUCHL3 wild-type gene was amplified by PCR from P. falciparum cDNA and subcloned into a pUML vector as a fusion with a C-terminal triple HA tag under control of the P. falciparum calmodulin promoter. To generate transgenic parasite strains, sorbitol-synchronized ring-stage parasites at 5–10% parasitemia were transfected with ∼100 plasmids/cell by electroporation. Positive transfectants were selected by treatment with 2.5 nm WR99210 (24.Fidock D.A. Wellems T.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 10931-10936Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 25.Triglia T. Wang P. Sims P.F. Hyde J.E. Cowman A.F. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3807-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The presence of the episome in this strain was maintained by continuous culture on 2.5 nm WR99210. Genomic DNA was harvested from synchronous, late-stage parasite cultures using the QIAamp DNA Mini Isolation Kit (Qiagen). For the PfUCHL3wt-3HA transfection, the presence of episome in recovered parasites was assessed by Southern blot using standard procedures. The Southern probe was a PCR product corresponding to the entire cDNA sequence of PfUCHL3 and was generated with the same primers used for cloning the PfUCHL3 coding sequence. Expression and reactivity of the modified enzyme were verified by Western blot. Mixed stage parasites were lysed using 1% Nonidet P-40 in the presence of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and lysate (40 μg of protein) was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the presence or absence of Ub-VME and subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE. Polypeptides were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes that were probed with 3F10-HRP (Roche Applied Science) to visualize HA-reactive proteins by chemiluminescence. PfUCHL3 expression was determined by the appearance of an HA-reactive band of the expected mass and enzyme reactivity by the shift of this band by 9 kDa to reflect covalent modification by Ub-VME. HsUCHL3 was generated as previously described (18.Popp M.W. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 3593-3602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). PfUCHL3 was cloned into the pET28(a)+ vector in frame with an N-terminal His6 tag. BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL-competent cells were transformed with plasmid DNA, and protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. Initial purification was done on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen), and the His tag was removed by thrombin cleavage using thrombin-agarose following the manufacturer's specifications (CleanCleave Kit, Novagen). Further purification was done by size-exclusion chromatography (S75 10/30, GE Healthcare) run with 25 mm Tris/HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. Fractions with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa that corresponds to monomeric PfUCHL3 were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and subsequently used in crystallization trials. Ub-AMC (Ub C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin) and Nedd8-AMC hydrolysis assays were performed as described previously (26.Schlieker C. Weihofen W.A. Frijns E. Kattenhorn L.M. Gaudet R. Ploegh H.L. Mol Cell. 2007; 25: 677-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, the hydrolysis was performed in reaction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol (pH 7.5)) supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Pierce). PfUCHL3 and HsUCHL3 concentrations were determined by Bradford test using bovine serum albumin as a standard. NedP1, Ub-AMC, and Nedd8-AMC were purchased from Boston Biochem. Crystals of free PfUCHL3 grew from sitting drops at 4 °C in conditions containing 100 mm Bicine, 25% polyethylene glycol 2000, 15% glycerol, 300 mm MgCl2, pH 9.0, as thin plates with maximal dimensions of 0.3 × 0.2 × 0.03 mm3. For cryoprotection, crystals were incubated in reservoir solution supplemented with glycerol in increments of 5% from 5 to 20% (v/v) prior to flash cryo-cooling crystals in liquid N2. To prepare the covalent complex, PfUCHL3 was reacted with a molar excess of Ub-vinyl methyl ester (UbVME) at room temperature for 2 h. The complex was separated from unliganded PfUCHL3 by anion-exchange chromatography on Mono Q resin (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted by applying a 10–300 mm NaCl gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. Fractions containing PfUCHL3-UbVME were concentrated to 10 mg/ml and used in crystallization trials. Crystals of the complex grew at 20 °C from a condition containing 100 mm Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, 200 mm NaCl, 25% polyethylene glycol 3350 to maximal dimensions of 0.05 × 0.05 × 0.1 mm3. Crystals were soaked in crystallization solution supplemented with 20% glycerol (v/v) prior to flash cryo-cooling in liquid N2. X-ray diffraction data of PfUCHL3-UbVME crystals were collected at 100 K at NE-CAT beamline ID24-C at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne IL, and processed with HKL2000 (27.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of PfUCHL3-UbVME was determined by molecular replacement with PHASER (28.Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) using the components of the HsUCHL3-UbVME structure as search models (Protein Data Bank code 1xd3). The model was built in coot (29.Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar) and refined with REFMAC5 (30.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). A 2.42 Å resolution data set from a free PfUCHL3 crystal was collected in house at 100 K using a MicroMax-007 rotating anode generator and R-AxisIV++ detector (Rigaku/MCS Inc). Data were processed with HKL2000. The structure of PfUCHL3 in complex with UbVME was used as a search model in PHASER and the structure refined with REFMAC5 (30.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Model quality was assessed using WHAT_CHECK (31.Hooft R.W. Vriend G. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), showing that all ϕ, ψ are within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot for the complex structure of PfUCHL3-UbVME and few are within generously allowed regions for the structure of free PfUCHL3.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsFree PfUCHL3PfUCHL3-UbVMECrystallographic dataSpace groupC2P21212Unit cell parameters (Å)168.3, 45.0, 99.5134.3, 75.3, 85.6β Angle (°)121.8Resolution range (Å)28.2–2.4220.0–2.30Observed reflections68,483223,276Unique reflections24,49438,252Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses refer to the outer resolution shell.99.0 (96.2)99.1 (97.6)I/σ(I)11.1 (2.3)14.4 (2.1)Rsym (%)bRsym = (|Ihkl − 〈I〉|)/(Ihkl), where Ihkl is the observed intensity and 〈I〉 is the average intensity obtained from multiple observations of symmetry-related reflections.7.5 (48.9)9.3 (45.1)Rr.i.m.

Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39017) Google Scholar) was used to build three systems containing free PfUCHL3 (Protein Data Bank code 2we6), PfUCHL3-Ub (Protein Data Bank code 2wdt) with the VME moiety replaced by the natural Gly-76, and a model of PfUCHL3-PfNedd8 based on the Ub crystal structure (Protein Data Bank code 1ubq) built using SwissModel (33.Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6040) Google Scholar). All three systems were solvated in water with sodium and chloride ions randomly placed for cell neutralization. The resulting free PfUCHL3, PfUCHL3-Ub, and PfUCHL3-Nedd8 systems contained a total of 65840 atoms (121 ions), 76041 (134 ions), and 73278 (132 ions), respectively. Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg residues were assumed to be charged throughout, while the protonation states of His residues were chosen to favor the formation of evident hydrogen bonds. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using NAMD 2.6 (34.Phillips J.C. Braun R. Wang W. Gumbart J. Tajkhorshid E. Villa E. Chipot C. Skeel R.D. Kalé L. Schulten K. J. Comput Chem. 2005; 26: 1781-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (13232) Google Scholar), the CHARMM22 force field for proteins with the CMAP correction (35.MacKerell J. AD Brooks B. Brooks I.I. CL Nilsson L. Roux B. Won Y. Karplus M. Encyclopedia of computational chemistry. 1998; 1: 271-277Google Scholar), and the TIP3P model for water (36.Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926Crossref Scopus (30176) Google Scholar). A uniform integration 2-fs time step was assumed for all types of interactions throughout all simulations. A 12-Å cutoff was applied with a switching function starting at 10 Å for van der Waals interactions, and the particle-mesh-Ewald method (with grid point density at least 1 Å−3) was used to compute long range electrostatic forces without cutoff (37.Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15781) Google Scholar), with a grid point density of at least 1 Å−3. Langevin dynamics were used to maintain a constant temperature of 310 K, with the damping coefficient set to 0.1 ps−1 for all heavy atoms. Coordinates of all atoms of the system were saved every picosecond for later analysis. Overall structural changes of the proteins were monitored with VMD by computing r.m.s.d. values of Cα atoms over the entire trajectories, using the crystallographic structure (or starting homology model in the case of the PfNedd8 complex) as a reference point. Previous work demonstrated that PfUCHL3 could react with Ub and Nedd8 probes, but not a small ubiquitin-like modifier probe (10.Frickel E.M. Quesada V. Muething L. Gubbels M.J. Spooner E. Ploegh H. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The probes used to identify PfUCHL3 were derived from the mouse Ub and Nedd8 sequences and have been characterized extensively (11.Hemelaar J. Borodovsky A. Kessler B.M. Reverter D. Cook J. Kolli N. Gan-Erdene T. Wilkinson K.D. Gill G. Lima C.D. Ploegh H.L. Ovaa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 84-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Briefly, these probes consist of the UBL equipped with an electrophilic warhead on the C-terminus, capable of forming a covalent bond with the active site cysteine of target enzymes. Mouse and Plasmodium Ub are virtually identical, differing in only a single amino acid (E16D). The Nedd8 sequences, however, share only 52% amino acid identity (Fig. 1A). Because mammalian Nedd8 is actually more similar to Ub than to PfNedd8 by sequence comparison (12.Ponder E.L. Bogyo M. Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1943-1952Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it was important to verify that PfUCHL3 reactivity toward PfNedd8 was real. To demonstrate that PfUCHL3 functions as a true deNeddylase in Plasmodium parasites, an electrophilic probe was generated in the form of a vinyl methyl ester added to the C-terminus of N-terminally FLAG tagged PfNedd8. To increase solubility, four amino acids predicted to contribute to hydrophobic surface patches and located on the side opposite to the predicted PfUCHL3 binding site were changed to glutamines (Fig. 1, A and B). The resulting probe was reacted with in vitro translated PfUCHL3 yielding an NEM-sensitive 10-kDa shift in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 1C). This shift is the result of covalent attachment of the electrophilic PfNedd8 probe to PfUCHL3, thus establishing activity of the enzyme toward PfNedd8. Of note, previous work demonstrates that the probe indeed targets the PfUCHL3 active site cysteine (10.Frickel E.M. Quesada V. Muething L. Gubbels M.J. Spooner E. Ploegh H. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). As further evidence, we observed similar shifts in electrophoretic mobility using probes derived from known substrates of PfUCHL3, including mammalian Nedd8 (MmN8-VS) and Ub (HAUb-VME). Whereas the PfNedd8 and Ub probes were used at saturating concentrations, the MmNedd8-VS concentration was suboptimal, leading to incomplete conversion of enzyme to the covalent adduct. Because the in vitro experiment shown in Fig. 1C measures an endpoint reaction, the real-time kinetics of PfUCHL3 were also measured to ensure that UBL recognition and cleavage occur at a physiologically relevant rate. We first determined the steady-state kinetic parameters of PfUCHL3 for the hydrolysis of Ub-AMC (7-acetoxy-4-methyl coumarin) to Km = 301 nm and kcat = 3.2 s−1 for PfUCHL3, which are similar to those obtained for the human isoform (Km = 162 nm and kcat = 2.9 s−1, data not shown). Pf-UCHL3-mediated Nedd8-AMC hydrolysis was assessed and compared with that of HsUCHL3, an efficient DUB and deNeddylase (13.Wada H. Kito K. Caskey L.S. Yeh E.T. Kamitani T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 688-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and NedP1, previously shown to be an efficient deNeddylase but not a DUB (14.Shen L.N. Liu H. Dong C. Xirodimas D. Naismith J.H. Hay R.T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1341-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, D and E). AMC hydrolysis time frames and efficiencies of PfUCHL3 were comparable to the positive controls for both Ub-AMC and Nedd8-AMC, thereby demonstrating that PfUCHL3 is truly bi-specific. To assess whether disruption of functional PfUCHL3 expression has an effect on parasite viability, a catalytically dead form of the enzyme was transfected into parasites in parallel with wild type. PfUCHL3 was N-terminally tagged with HA, and this fusion was subsequently used as template to generate a cysteine to alanine substitution in the catalytic triad by site-directed mutagenesis. As previously demonstrated (10.Frickel E.M. Quesada V. Muething L. Gubbels M.J. Spooner E. Ploegh H. Artavanis-Tsakonas K. Cell Microbiol. 2007; 9: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), this exchange renders the enzyme entirely inactive. HA-PfUCHL3wt and HA-PfUCHL3(C92A) were transfected into 3D7 parasites in parallel on three separate occasions. In each case, the HA-PfUCHL3wt parasites grew and expressed functional HA-PfUCHL3 (Fig. 2, A and B), whereas the mutants did not. These results suggest that the inactive enzyme is having a dominant negative effect on the endogenous wild-type isoform and leads to the conclusion that this enzyme is likely essential to parasite survival. To further probe the interaction of PfUCHL3 with its UBL substrates, structural studies were undertaken. The crystal structure of HsUCHL3 has been determined both in its free form (15.Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N. Cook W.J. Wilkinson K.D. Hill C.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3787-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) as well as in complex with Ub (16.Misaghi S. Galardy P.J. Meester W.J. Ovaa H. Ploegh H.L. Gaudet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1512-1520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), both of which served as references for PfUCHL3. An amino acid sequence alignment of the human and P. falciparum enzymes, which are 30% identical, is shown in Fig. 3A. The crystal structure of the PfUCHL3-UbVME complex (Fig. 4A) was determined by molecular replacement using the components of the structure of human UCHL3 bound to UbVME (Protein Data Bank code 1xd3) as search models. The structure was refined to a resolution of 2.3 Å and a final Rwork value of 18.8% (Rfree 23.5%). The refined PfUCHL3 structure was in turn used as a search model in molecular replacement to determine the 2.42-Å resolution structure of free PfUCHL3 (Fig. 3C; Rwork 21.8% and Rfree 25.1%). See Table 1 for data collection and refinement statistics. Continuous electron density was observed for all Ub residues, whereas, for both UbVME-bound and free PfUCHL3, the four N-terminal residues and residues 58–78, corresponding to helix 3 in HsUCHL3, lack interpretable density and are therefore disordered. Like its human ortholog, the PfUCHL3 structure is composed of a helix-β-helix sandwich that features a central six-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices (Fig. 4, A and B). The C terminus of UbVME binds a narrow groove lined by the catalytic triad residues Cys-92, His-164, and Asp-179. The UbVME C-terminal tail is also covered by the PfUCHL3 crossover loop (Fig. 4A). Electron density for the active site shows the catalytic cysteine, located at the N terminus of central helix 4, participating in a 1.7 Å thioether bond with the VME moiety that replaces the C-terminal Gly-76 of wild-type Ub (Fig. 5B). In addition to the interactions between the Ub C terminus and active site residues, conserved residues Tyr-35 and Leu-41 of PfUCHL3 that precede helix 2 cover a hydrophobic surface patch on the Ub β-sheet. Finally, the first β-hairpin loop of Ub, with residues Leu-8 and Thr-9 (both are conserved in Nedd8 but in no other UBL), is accommodated by a narrow hydrophobic pocket lined by Helix 7 and the loop preceding Helix 1, a signature interaction motif between UCH family proteases and Ub (Fig. 4). As expected, a DALI data base search identified the closest structural neighbors of PfUCHL3 as human UCHL3 and UCHL1 and yeast UCH (Yuh-1). The sequence identities of these enzymes exceed 28% and superimpositions of at least 190 Cα atoms yielded root mean squared deviation (r.m.s.d.) values below 2.2 Å. The structural similarities of PfUCHL3, HsUCHL3, and Yuh-1 suggest a shared mode of Ub recognition (Fig. 4, A and B, and data not shown). However, the free forms of the respective enzymes each exhibit distinct features. For instance, helix 6′ and the following crossover loop region are disordered in free HsUCHL3 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, the groove that accommodates the C-terminal stretch of Ub is partly occluded by a loop requiring major conformational changes upon binding of Ub or Nedd8 (15.Johnston S.C. Larsen C.N."

To assess functions and potential disease phenotypes of type XXVII collagen, we examined its roles in zebrafish embryonic and post-embryonic development.We identified two type XXVII collagen genes in zebrafish, col27a1a and col27a1b. Both col27a1a and col27a1b were expressed in notochord and cartilage in the embryo and early larva. To determine sites of type XXVII collagen function, col27a1a and col27a1b were knocked down using morpholino antisense oligonucleotides. Knockdown of col27a1a singly or in conjunction with col27a1b resulted in curvature of the notochord at early stages and formation of scoliotic curves as well as dysmorphic vertebrae at later stages. These defects were accompanied by abnormal distributions of cells and protein localization in the notochord, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy, as well as delayed vertebral mineralization as detected histologically.Together, our findings indicate a key role for type XXVII collagen in notochord morphogenesis and axial skeletogenesis and suggest a possible human disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2051227809,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are pluripotent cells able to grow indefinitely in culture and to differentiate into all cell types of embryos upon specific stimuli. Molecular mechanisms controlling the unique characteristics of ESCs are still largely unknown. We identified Dies1 (Differentiation of ESCs 1), an unpublished gene, that encodes a type I membrane protein. ESCs stably transfected with Dies1 small hairpin RNAs failed to properly differentiate toward neural and cardiac cell fate upon appropriate stimuli and continued to express markers of undifferentiated cells, such as the membrane-associated alkaline phosphatase, and transcription factors, like Oct3/4 and Nanog, when grown under conditions promoting differentiation. Our results demonstrated that Dies1 is required for BMP4/Smad1 signaling cascade; in undifferentiated ESCs Dies1 knockdown did not affect the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor downstream targets, whereas it resulted in a strong decrease of BMP4 signaling, as demonstrated by the decrease of Id1, -2, and -3 mRNAs, the decreased activity of Id1 gene promoter, and the reduced phospho-Smad1 levels. Dies1 knockdown had no effect in murine ESCs when the expression of the BMP4 receptor Alk3 was suppressed. The phenotype induced by Dies1 suppression in ESCs is due to the indirect activation of the Nodal/Activin pathway, which is a consequence of the BMP4 pathway inhibition and is sufficient to support the mESC undifferentiated state in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor."
https://openalex.org/W2068041918,"Hop stunt was a mysterious disorder that first emerged in the 1940s in commercial hops in Japan. To investigate the origin of this disorder, we infected hops with natural Hop stunt viroid (HpSVd) isolates derived from four host species (hop, grapevine, plum and citrus), which except for hop represent possible sources of the ancestral viroid. These plants were maintained for 15 years, then analyzed the HpSVd variants present. Here we show that the variant originally found in cultivated grapevines gave rise to various combinations of mutations at positions 25, 26, 54, 193, and 281. However, upon prolonged infection, these variants underwent convergent evolution resulting in a limited number of adapted mutants. Some of them showed nucleotide sequences identical to those currently responsible for hop stunt epidemics in commercial hops in Japan, China, and the United States. Therefore, these results indicate that we have successfully reproduced the original process by which a natural HpSVd variant naturally introduced into cultivated hops was able to mutate into the HpSVd variants that are currently present in commercial hops. Furthermore, and importantly, we have identified cultivated grapevines as a symptomless reservoir in which HSVd can evolve and be transmitted to hop crops to cause epidemics."
https://openalex.org/W2056095387,"In cystic fibrosis (CF), the most frequent mutant variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), F508del-CFTR protein, is misfolded and retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We previously showed that the unfolded protein response (UPR) may be triggered in CF. Since prolonged UPR activation leads to apoptosis via the calcium-calpain-caspase-12-caspase-3 cascade and because apoptosis is altered in CF, our aim was to compare the ER stress-induced apoptosis pathway between wild type (Wt) and F508del-CFTR expressing cells. Here we show that the calcium-calpain-caspase-12-caspase-3 cascade is altered in F508del-CFTR expressing cells. We propose that this alteration is involved in the altered apoptosis triggering observed in CF."
https://openalex.org/W1976687244,"Background Fractalkine/CX3CL1, a surface chemokine, binds to CX3CR1 expressed by different lymphocyte subsets. Since CX3CL1 has been detected in the germinal centres of secondary lymphoid tissue, in this study we have investigated CX3CR1 expression and function in human naïve, germinal centre and memory B cells isolated from tonsil or peripheral blood. Methodology/Principal Findings We demonstrate unambiguously that highly purified human B cells from tonsil and peripheral blood expressed CX3CR1 at mRNA and protein levels as assessed by quantitative PCR, flow cytometry and competition binding assays. In particular, naïve, germinal centre and memory B cells expressed CX3CR1 but only germinal centre B cells were attracted by soluble CX3CL1 in a transwell assay. CX3CL1 signalling in germinal centre B cells involved PI3K, Erk1/2, p38, and Src phosphorylation, as assessed by Western blot experiments. CX3CR1+ germinal centre B cells were devoid of centroblasts and enriched for centrocytes that migrated to soluble CX3CL1. ELISA assay showed that soluble CX3CL1 was secreted constitutively by follicular dendritic cells and T follicular helper cells, two cell populations homing in the germinal centre light zone as centrocytes. At variance with that observed in humans, soluble CX3CL1 did not attract spleen B cells from wild type mice. OVA immunized CX3CR1−/− or CX3CL1−/− mice showed significantly decreased specific IgG production compared to wild type mice. Conclusion/Significance We propose a model whereby human follicular dendritic cells and T follicular helper cells release in the light zone of germinal centre soluble CX3CL1 that attracts centrocytes. The functional implications of these results warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W1964909656,"Background Signaling through MEK→ERK1/2 and PI3 kinases is implicated in many aspects of cell physiology, including the survival of oxidant exposure. Oxidants play a role in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes, many of which rely on transport in and out of the nucleus. However, how oxidative stress impacts nuclear trafficking is not well defined. Methodology/Principal Findings To better understand the effect of stress on nucleocytoplasmic trafficking, we exposed cells to the oxidant diethyl maleate. This treatment activated MEK→ERK1/2 as well as PI3 kinase→Akt cascades and triggered the inhibition of classical nuclear import. To define the molecular mechanisms that regulate nuclear transport, we examined whether MEK and PI3 kinase signaling affected the localization of key transport factors. Using recently developed tools for image acquisition and analysis, the subcellular distributions of importin-α, CAS, and nucleoporins Nup153 and Nup88 were quantified in different cellular compartments. These studies identified specific profiles for the localization of transport factors in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and at the nuclear envelope. Our results demonstrate that MEK and PI3 kinase signaling as well as oxidative stress control nuclear trafficking and the localization of transport components. Furthermore, stress not only induced changes in transport factor distribution, but also upregulated post-translational modification of transport factors. Our results are consistent with the idea that the phosphorylation of importin-α, CAS, Nup153, and Nup88, and the O-GlcNAc modification of Nup153 increase when cells are exposed to oxidant. Conclusions/Significance Our studies defined the complex regulation of classical nuclear import and identified key transport factors that are targeted by stress, MEK, and PI3 kinase signaling."

Blocking myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation with small molecule inhibitors alters the shape, adhesion, and migration of many types of smooth muscle and cancer cells. Dephosphorylation is mediated by myosin phosphatase (MP), a complex that consists of a catalytic subunit (protein phosphatase 1c, PP1c), a large subunit (myosin phosphatase targeting subunit, MYPT), and a small subunit of unknown function. MYPT functions by targeting PP1c onto its substrate, phosphorylated myosin II. Using RNA interference, we show here that stability of PP1c β and MYPT1 is interdependent; knocking down one of the subunits decreases the expression level of the other. Associated changes in cell shape also occur, characterized by flattening and spreading accompanied by increased cortical actin, and cell numbers decrease secondary to apoptosis. Of the three highly conserved isoforms of PP1c, we show that MYPT1 binding is restricted to PP1c β, and, using chimeric analysis and site-directed mutations, that the central region of PP1c β confers the isoform-specific binding. This finding was unexpected because the MP crystal structure has been solved and was reported to identify the variable, C-terminal domain of PP1c β as being the region key for isoform-specific interaction with MYPT1.

Phosphorylation of smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin II is implicated in many physiological phenomena, including smooth muscle contraction, cell motility, and cytokinesis.

Increases in the levels of cytosolic [Ca2+]i initiate smooth muscle contraction by triggering binding of calmodulin to myosin light chain kinase, which then phosphorylates myosin light chain, increasing cross-bridge cycling and the rate of tension development (2.Dimopoulos G.J.

Conversely, smooth muscle relaxation occurs via dephosphorylation of myosin light chain by MP. myosin phosphatase myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 protein phosphatase 1 Chinese hamster ovary small hairpin RNA green fluorescent protein co-immunoprecipitation. MP directs cell migration by increasing contractile forces through regulating both myosin phosphorylation and actin assembly (3.Xia D. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Knockdown of myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (MYPT1), one of the components of the MP complex, increases F-actin stress fibers and the number of focal adhesions (3.Xia D. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Contractile force exerted from the focal adhesion sites (cell bottom) is regulated by several kinases including Rho kinase. Less is known about how the cortical contractile force is regulated, although we suggested recently that it may in part be through the action of phospholipase D2, which inhibits MP-regulated myosin II-driven changes in cell shape during spreading (4.Du G. Frohman M.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2009; 20: 200-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MP undertakes other roles, including inhibiting apoptosis by dephosphorylating the histone deacetylase protein HDAC7, facilitating its nuclear localization and repression of Nur77, a proapoptotic gene (5.Parra M. Mahmoudi T. Verdin E. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MP also blocks oncogenic signaling cascades through the dephosphorylation of other target proteins, such as merlin, which regulates the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway (6.Jin H. Sperka T. Herrlich P. Morrison H. Nature. 2006; 442: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 7.Jung J.R. Kim H. Jeun S.S. Lee J.Y. Koh E.J. Ji C. Mol. Cells. 2005; 20: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar), and an MP inhibitor, CPI-17, has been shown to drive tumorigenic transformation (6.Jin H. Sperka T. Herrlich P. Morrison H. Nature. 2006; 442: 576-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Consistent with these reports, MP is up-regulated in some cancer cell lines, and its knockdown using RNA interference decreases the cancer cell viability (8.Schlabach M.R. Luo J. Solimini N.L. Hu G. Xu Q. Li M.Z. Zhao Z. Smogorzewska A. Sowa M.E. Ang X.L. Westbrook T.F. Liang A.C. Chang K. Hackett J.A. Harper J.W. Hannon G.J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2008; 319: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), suggesting it as a potential target for cancer therapeutics. MP is composed of a complex of three proteins: a catalytic subunit (protein phosphatase 1c, PP1c), a large subunit (MYPT), and a 20-kDa small subunit (M20) of unknown function (Fig. 1A). By altering the phosphatase active site, the interaction with MYTP confers myosin specificity to PP1c. The main isoform in smooth muscle, MYPT1, complexes with only one of the three isoforms of PP1c, specifically PP1c β (1.Ito M. Nakano T. Erdodi F. Hartshorne D.J. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2004; 259: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 9.Eto M. Kirkbride J.A. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2005; 62: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), despite the extensive similarity it has to the α and γ isoforms throughout most of the protein. A crystal structure of the complex between PP1c β and residues 1–299 of MYPT1 has been solved (10.Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), from which it was predicted that MYPT1 makes contact with the central region of PP1c β via the MYPT1 N-terminal arm (amino acids 1–34) and an RVXF motif (amino acids 35–38), and with the C terminus of PP1c β (amino acids Tyr305 and Tyr307) via the second group of ankyrin repeats in MYPT1. Because the PP1c isoforms differ most dramatically in the N-terminal 45 amino acid residues and in the C terminus (amino acids 302–328, with the rest of the protein sequences being more than 95% identical), the report also predicted that the PP1c β interaction with MYPT1 through the PP1c β C-terminal domain (e.g. residues Tyr305 and Tyr307) would constitute the basis for the selective complex formation of the β-isoform with MYPT1. In this study, we sought to explore further the basis for the isoform specificity of PP1c β complex formation with MYPT1. Unexpectedly, chimeric and mutational studies revealed that the central region of PP1c β mediates the isoform-selective interaction. Moreover, the mutational series generated a mutant that exhibits “weakened” complex formation, setting the stage for a rationalized screening to identify potential chemotherapeutic agents that could target this component of the cytoskeletal infrastructure through destabilizing the interaction between PP1c β and MYPT1. PP1 chimeric expression plasmids were created using a PCR-based strategy with pQCXIP-GFP. The PP1c β (T197Q, S232A, N236H/R237K, G280A) and PP1c γ (Q198T, A233S, H237N/K238R, A281G) site-directed mutants were generated by substituting corresponding amino acids in pQCXIP-GFP-PP1c γ or -PP1c β using a PCR-based strategy. All mutation and fusion constructs were confirmed by sequencing. CHO cells were cultured in F-12 nutrient mixture (Ham's) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. MDA-MB-231, GP2-293, and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum. GP2-293 retroviral packaging cells were passaged into six 10-cm plates at a 1:7 ratio and transfected 24 h later with small hairpin RNA (shRNA) constructs plus vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). On the following day, the cells to be infected were passaged into a 6-well plate, and the next day, harvested virus was added (along with 2 μl of Polybrene (stock 6 mg/ml)). One day later, the cells were selected with puromycin. Cells cultured to near confluence in 60-mm tissue culture plates were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) as well as 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1 mm NaF. The lysates were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with primary antibodies recognizing c-Myc epitope (monoclonal, 1:1000, 9B11; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), green fluorescent protein (GFP) (polyclonal, 1:1000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA), MYPT1 (polyclonal, 1:10,000; Covance, Princeton, NJ), PP1α (monoclonal, 1:500; Sigma), PP1γ (polyclonal; Stratagene), PP1δ (β) (polyclonal, 1:500; Upstate, Lake Placid, NY), or α-tubulin (B-5-1-2, 1:1000; Sigma), followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 anti-rabbit (1:5000; Invitrogen) or IRDye 800 anti-mouse (1:5000; Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA). Fluorescent signals were detected with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LICOR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and quantitated using the instrumentation software. PP1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates prepared as above using anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody (M5546; Sigma) as described previously (11.Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S.S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In brief, the lysates were passed through a 255/8-gauge needle five times and spun at 4 °C at 14,000 × g for 10 min. Anti-c-Myc was then added to the supernatants in fresh Eppendorf tubes and incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 1 h. A 50:50 slurry of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was then added to the supernatant, followed by another hour of incubation. The samples were then spun down at 14,000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatant was removed. The protein A-Sepharose was then washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lacking protease inhibitors, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled at 95 °C for 5 min. Western blotting was then performed as described above. CHO cells were imaged using a Nikon Eclipse TS100 light microscope and photographed using a Nikon Digital Sight camera. Images were analyzed using NIS-Elements F v2.30 imaging software. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells plated on coated coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. F-actin was visualized using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen) and imaged using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal microscope. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Protein sequence alignments were performed using the Network Protein Sequence Analysis: Multalin Alignment algorithm (12.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar). At least three independent experiments were performed, unless indicated otherwise in the figure legends. Statistical analyses were performed using two-tailed equal variance Student's test. p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We confirmed that MYPT1 interacts specifically with PP1c β using a co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) approach (Fig. 1B). HeLa cells were co-transfected with enhanced GFP-tagged PP1c α, β, or γ, and c-Myc epitope-tagged MYPT1 or MYPT1 F38A. Mutation of the Phe38 residue in MYPT1 to alanine has been reported to suffice to disrupt the interaction of MYPT1 with PP1c β (9.Eto M. Kirkbride J.A. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2005; 62: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Lanes 2–4 show samples in which only the GFP-tagged PP1c isoforms were expressed and subjected to co-IP using anti-c-Myc for the co-IP step and anti-GFP for the immunoblotting step; under these circumstances, the GFP-PP1c proteins were not nonspecifically pulled down. In contrast (lanes 6–8), co-expression of MYPT1 resulted in efficient co-IP of PP1c β, but not α or δ. Specificity of the co-IP was confirmed in lane 11, where it is shown that MYPT1 F38A was unable to co-immunoprecipitate PP1c β. Specificity and significance of the interaction were examined in CHO cells for the endogenous proteins using a shRNA approach (Fig. 2). shRNA-mediated knockdown of PP1c β using two different targeting sequences (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 3) resulted in decreased expression of MYPT1, implying that MYPT1 stability requires a successful complex formation that cannot be performed by other potential partners extant in the cells (for example, other PP1c isoforms). Similarly, shRNA-mediated knockdown of MYPT1 using any of four different targeting sequences resulted in decreased levels of PP1c β expression, implying that PP1c β stability analogously requires complex formation specifically with MYPT1. Similar to the previously reported consequences of knockdown of MYPT1 (3.Xia D. Stull J.T. Kamm K.E. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 506-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), we found that PP1c β knockdown had readily apparent effects on cellular morphology and potentially on viability. At time points at which MDA-MB-231 cells expressing control shRNA had become confluent, dishes with cells expressing either of the two PP1c β shRNAs were subconfluent and were remarkable for many floating, presumably dead cells (Fig. 2B, top panels). Quantitatively, adherent PP1c β shRNA-expressing cells were 35% as numerous as control shRNA-expressing cells (45 cells/field versus 120 cells/field, 10 fields counted for each condition, n = 3, p < 0.01). The PP1c β shRNA-expressing cells that remained adherent were larger and more flattened (middle panels; 10.5 flattened cells/field for the PP1c β shRNA-expressing cells versus 5.2 flattened cells/field for the control shRNA-expressing cells, p < 0.01) and were characterized by large numbers of thin, F-actin-rich membrane extensions (bottom panels). Quantitatively, control cells exhibited three membrane extensions/cell versus 16/cell for the PP1c β shRNA-expressing cells (p < 0.01). The α, β, and γ isoforms of PP1c exhibit variability in the N- and C-portions of the proteins but are highly similar over the central 85% of the protein (Fig. 3). Based on crystallographic studies, Terrak et al. (10.Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) reported that the isoform-specific interaction between MYTP1 and PP1c β is mediated by the C-terminal region of PP1c β. To confirm and extend this report using a direct approach, we thus generated chimeric PP1c proteins between PP1c β and PP1c γ as shown in Fig. 4 and then repeated the co-IP pulldown assay performed in Fig. 1. As before, co-IP of PP1c β and MYPT1 was readily detectable (Fig. 4, lane 3), in contrast to the attempted co-IP of PP1c β and MYPT1 F38A (lane 4), where no interaction was observed. Consistent with the N terminus being unimportant in this context, the β(γ)1 allele, which contained the first 121 amino acids of PP1c β and the middle and remainder of PP1c γ, did not co-IP with MYPT1 (lane 6), whereas the reciprocal mutant, γ(β)1, did (lane 8). Unexpectedly though, the β(γ)2 construct, which derived its C-terminal region from PP1c γ, did co-IP with MYPT1 (lane 10), whereas the reciprocal construct γ(β)2, did not (lane 12). These findings suggested that the isoform specificity of the interaction arose from the highly conserved central region of the protein (amino acids 121–303) rather than via the variable C terminus. This possibility was then examined by generating chimeric isoforms in which the central regions of the β and γ isoforms were swapped (Fig. 5). Confirming the earlier results, the βγβ isoform (in which the central region was derived from PP1c γ) did not co-IP with MYPT1 (lane 4), whereas the reciprocal γβγ chimeric protein did (lane 6), ruling out a significant role for amino acids Tyr305 and Tyr307 in the PP1c β C terminus.FIGURE 4The C terminus of PP1c β does not mediate the isoform specificity of interaction with MYPT1.A, structure of PP1 chimera constructs. Based on the alignment of the three human PP1c isoforms, two sets of chimera constructs were generated as shown for PP1c β and PP1c γ. In the first set, PP1c was divided in half, and the C-terminal halves of PP1c β and PP1c γ were exchanged. These constructs were denoted PP1c β(γ1) and PP1c γ(β1). For the second set of constructs, the extreme C termini (last 30 amino acids) of PP1c β and PP1c γ were exchanged. These constructs were denoted PP1c β(γ2) and PP1c γ(β2). B, HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with the GFP-tagged PP1c wild-type or chimeric plasmids and Myc-tagged wild-type or mutant MYPT1 as indicated. 48 h later, the cells were lysed, and Western blotting was performed against the corresponding proteins using the appropriate antibodies. Immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5The central region of PP1c β mediates isoform specificity of interaction with MYPT1. Chimeric constructs were generated and co-immunoprecipitated as shown and described in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) There are only six positions at which the amino acid sequences vary between PP1c β and PP1c γ in the central region (Fig. 3). We next used site-directed mutagenesis to examine their importance in the interaction. Mutation of Ser232 and Gly280 (and Gln213, not shown) to the corresponding amino acid in PP1c γ did not alter the efficiency of PP1c β and MYPT1 co-IP (Fig. 6, lanes 5 and 6). However, mutation of Thr197 to Gln almost completely eliminated the PP1c β-MYPT1 interaction (lane 4; residual interaction ∼4% of wild-type protein, n = 3 independent experiments). Conversely, substitution of the individual PP1c β amino acids into PP1c γ, including for Q198T, did not result in gain-of-interaction mutant alleles (lanes 10–12), ruling out a single determinative residue as being responsible for the isoform-specific interaction. We then generated multimutants for analysis (Fig. 7), which yield interesting but more complex outcomes. Adding the S232A mutation, which in itself had no apparent effect on the interaction, to T197Q, rescued much of the loss of interaction observed for T197Q (Fig. 7, lane 4; 25% of control co-IP, n = 3). The double mutant N236H/R237K (β2x) interacted well with MYPT1 (lane 5, 65% of control interaction, n = 3), but adding this change to the T179Q mutation did not result in rescue of the T179Q loss of interaction (lane 6), and the same lack of rescue was observed for addition of the G280A mutation to T179Q (lane 7). Given these results, it was thus unexpected that mutation of two amino acids in PP1c γ (H237N and K238R (γ2x)) to the corresponding residues in PP1c β resulted in a partial gain-of-interaction outcome (lane 9, 3% of control interaction, n = 3), and further conversion of the sequence toward PP1c β (for example, Q198T/γ2x) again resulted in loss of the interaction (lane 10). Taken together, these results again suggest the lack of a single residue controlling the interaction and suggest instead that the residues unique to PP1c β position residues potentially in common between the different isoforms to interact effectively with MYPT1. As described earlier, Terrak et al. (10.Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) reported that the isoform-specific interaction between MYTP1 and PP1c β is likely mediated by the C-terminal region of PP1c β, which is indicated by the arrow in Fig. 8A. In contrast, we show here that this region is nondeterminative for the specificity of the interaction and that the key residues instead lie far away in the structure, at or near Thr197 through Ser232. Intriguingly, this stretch of residues constitutes the interaction surface of PP1c with the N-terminal arm of MYPT1, a region in MYPT1 thought to be key in mediating the interaction with myosin. Furthermore, this region neighbors the hydrophobic pocket in PP1c β (amino acids 242–293) that interacts with the MYPT1 RVXF motif. Phe38 in this motif (Fig. 8B) is essential for MP complex formation because the interaction is disrupted when it is mutated to alanine (9.Eto M. Kirkbride J.A. Brautigan D.L. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2005; 62: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 10.Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Gly280 is adjacent to the Phe38 binding pocket and, although not part of the interaction surface, substitution of this residue with alanine would necessarily imply a structural perturbation of the pocket. Three of the five remaining residues that are not conserved between PP1c isoforms (Ser232, Asn236, and Thr197) appear to mediate the PP1c β-MYTP1 interaction directly. Ser232 and Thr197 make hydrophobic contacts with MYTP1 residues, whereas Asn236 hydrogen-bonds with MYTP1 side chains and backbone. The N236H and T197Q substitutions would result in obvious steric clashes with MYTP1 in the conformation observed in the crystal structure, and, consistently, the single T197Q mutation was able to disrupt the interaction severely. None of the residues, however, appears to be individually responsible for the specificity of the interaction, and this is consistent with their observed positions in the crystal structure. The results with the multiple mutants confirm that subtle alterations to the interaction surface, rather than the presence or absence of specific contacts, are responsible for modulating binding specificity. Thus, the effects of different individual mutations can be partially compensatory, and it is the global structural changes that result from them that appear to determine the specificity of the interaction. For instance, whereas the PP1c β N236 and R237 side chains are not essential to maintain the interaction, the reciprocal mutation (of PP1c γ His237 and Lys238 to Asn and Arg, respectively) generated a gain-of interaction outcome. In this study, we report the surprising finding that the isoform-specific interaction of PP1c β with MYPT1 is driven by interactions with just a few nonconserved residues in a central region of PP1c β that is otherwise 96% identical to PP1c γ, rather than by interactions with the nonconserved N and C termini. This finding is in contrast to the interpretation of a prior report on the co-crystal structure of PP1c β with MYPT1 (10.Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). However, our work also supports and extends other aspects of the published report by demonstrating that the region in PP1c β that confers the isoform specificity is one known already to interact with MYPT1, at its N terminus. The RVXF has become recognized as a key motif in the more than 100 proteins that interact with the PP1 superfamily (13.Hendrickx A. Beullens M. Ceulemans H. Den Abt T. Van Eynde A. Nicolaescu E. Lesage B. Bollen M. Chem. Biol. 2009; 16: 365-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, because the hydrophobic region in PP1c that binds the RVXF motif is identical in the three PP1c isoforms, isoform-specific interaction cannot be mediated by this component of the complex formation. The four key residues identified, Thr197, Ser232, Asn236, and Arg237, are similarly unique in PP1c β compared with PP1c α, which also does not interact with MYPT1. As described in the Introduction, MP undertakes diverse roles in transformation and growth and migration of cancer cells, and we illustrate the significance of this complex by showing changes in cell viability/adherence and morphology when PP1c β or MYPT1 is knocked down using shRNA. Small molecule compounds that target other components of the cytoskeleton as therapeutics have been developed, such as Taxol, which stabilizes the microtubule network, and having the ability to target MP could add depth in the clinical setting because Taxol is generally only effective initially, i.e. cancer cells eventually develop resistance to it. One approach would be to develop phosphatase inhibitors; however, it would be difficult to create a PP1c β-specific inhibitor, given its high degree of similarity to other PP1c isoforms, much less to the larger PP1 superfamily of phosphatases. Another approach would be to identify small molecule compounds capable of disrupting the specific interaction between PP1c β and MYPT1 using high throughput screens. Finding such compounds could be challenging using approaches based on the wild-type, full-strength PP1c β-MYPT1 interaction. It is possible, however, that lead compounds could readily be identified, based on the series of mutants we describe in this report, which exhibit weakened interactions. Screens and counterscreens could be designed to disrupt the interaction between MYPT1 and residues on PP1c β such as Thr197, Thr197/Ser232, and Asn236/Arg237, which exhibit 4%, 25%, and 75% of the MYPT1 interaction compared with wild-type PP1c β to identify lead compounds that could then be improved through combinatorial chemistry optimization.

https://openalex.org/W1993232879,"Genome sequences are annotated by computational prediction of coding sequences, followed by similarity searches such as BLAST, which provide a layer of possible functional information. While the existence of processes such as alternative splicing complicates matters for eukaryote genomes, the view of bacterial genomes as a linear series of closely spaced genes leads to the assumption that computational annotations that predict such arrangements completely describe the coding capacity of bacterial genomes. We undertook a proteomic study to identify proteins expressed by Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 from genes that were not predicted during the genome annotation. Mapping peptides to the Pf0-1 genome sequence identified sixteen non-annotated protein-coding regions, of which nine were antisense to predicted genes, six were intergenic, and one read in the same direction as an annotated gene but in a different frame. The expression of all but one of the newly discovered genes was verified by RT-PCR. Few clues as to the function of the new genes were gleaned from informatic analyses, but potential orthologs in other Pseudomonas genomes were identified for eight of the new genes.

Minicircles replicate after release from the network, and their progeny reattach. Remarkably, trypanosomes have six mitochondrial DNA helicases related to yeast PIF1 helicase. Here we report that one of the six, TbPIF1, functions in minicircle replication. RNA interference (RNAi) of TbPIF1 causes a growth defect and kinetoplast DNA loss. Minicircle replication intermediates decrease during RNAi, and there is an accumulation of multiply interlocked, covalently closed minicircle dimers (fraction U). In studying the significance of fraction U, we found that this species also accumulates during RNAi of mitochondrial topoisomerase II. These data indicate that one function of TbPIF1 is an involvement, together with topoisomerase II, in the segregation of minicircle progeny."
https://openalex.org/W2005207646,"Postsynaptic enrichment of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) depends on the activation of the muscle receptor tyrosine MuSK by neural agrin. Agrin-stimulation of MuSK is known to initiate an intracellular signaling cascade that leads to the clustering of AChRs in an actin polymerization-dependent manner, but the molecular steps which link MuSK activation to AChR aggregation remain incompletely defined.In this study we used biochemical, cell biological and molecular assays to investigate a possible role in AChR clustering of cortactin, a protein which is a tyrosine kinase substrate and a regulator of F-actin assembly and which has also been previously localized at AChR clustering sites. We report that cortactin was co-enriched at AChR clusters in situ with its target the Arp2/3 complex, which is a key stimulator of actin polymerization in cells. Cortactin was further preferentially tyrosine phosphorylated at AChR clustering sites and treatment of myotubes with agrin significantly enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin. Importantly, forced expression in myotubes of a tyrosine phosphorylation-defective cortactin mutant (but not wild-type cortactin) suppressed agrin-dependent AChR clustering, as did the reduction of endogenous cortactin levels using RNA interference, and introduction of the mutant cortactin into muscle cells potently inhibited synaptic AChR aggregation in response to innervation.Our results suggest a novel function of phosphorylation-dependent cortactin signaling downstream from agrin/MuSK in facilitating AChR clustering at the developing NMJ."
https://openalex.org/W2046196726,"The loss of photosynthesis has occurred often in eukaryotic evolution, even more than its acquisition, which occurred at least nine times independently and which generated the evolution of the supergroups Archaeplastida, Rhizaria, Chromalveolata and Excavata. This secondary loss of autotrophic capability is essential to explain the evolution of eukaryotes and the high diversity of protists, which has been severely underestimated until recently. However, the ecological and evolutionary scenarios behind this evolutionary ""step back"" are still largely unknown.Using a dynamic model of heterotrophic and mixotrophic flagellates and two types of prey, large bacteria and ultramicrobacteria, we examine the influence of DOC concentration, mixotroph's photosynthetic growth rate, and external limitations of photosynthesis on the coexistence of both types of flagellates. Our key premises are: large bacteria grow faster than small ones at high DOC concentrations, and vice versa; and heterotrophic flagellates are more efficient than the mixotrophs grazing small bacteria (both empirically supported). We show that differential efficiency in bacteria grazing, which strongly depends on cell size, is a key factor to explain the loss of photosynthesis in mixotrophs (which combine photosynthesis and bacterivory) leading to purely heterotrophic lineages. Further, we show in what conditions an heterotroph mutant can coexist, or even out-compete, its mixotrophic ancestor, suggesting that bacterivory and cell size reduction may have been major triggers for the diversification of eukaryotes.Our results suggest that, provided the mixotroph's photosynthetic advantage is not too large, the (small) heterotroph will also dominate in nutrient-poor environments and will readily invade a community of mixotrophs and bacteria, due to its higher efficiency exploiting the ultramicrobacteria. As carbon-limited conditions were presumably widespread throughout Earth history, such a scenario may explain the numerous transitions from phototrophy to mixotrophy and further to heterotrophy within virtually all major algal lineages. We challenge prevailing concepts that affiliated the evolution of phagotrophy with eutrophic or strongly light-limited environments only."

We therefore investigated signaling pathways involved in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-mediated increases in versican core protein and GAG chain synthesis in arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). PDGF treatment of ASMCs resulted in increased versican core protein synthesis and elongation of GAG chains attached to the versican core protein. The effects of PDGF on versican mRNA were blocked by inhibiting either protein kinase C (PKC) or the ERK pathways, whereas the GAG elongation effect of PDGF was blocked by PKC inhibition but not by ERK inhibition. Interestingly, blocking protein synthesis in the presence of cycloheximide abolished the PDGF effect, but not in the presence of xyloside, indicating that GAG synthesis that results from PKC activation is independent from de novo protein synthesis. PDGF also stimulated an increase in the chondroitin-6-sulfate to chondroitin-4-sulfate ratio of GAG chains on versican, and this effect was blocked by PKC inhibitors. These data show that PKC activation is sufficient to cause GAG chain elongation, but both PKC and ERK activation are required for versican mRNA core protein expression.

https://openalex.org/W2002393397,"The target of rapamycin (TOR) is a conserved eukaryotic Ser/Thr kinase that regulates cellular growth in response to the nutrient and energy state. TOR signaling plays an important role in the development of diseases such as cancer, obesity, and diabetes and in different redox-sensitive processes (hypoxia, apoptosis, and aging). Because TOR has been detected at different cellular membranes and in the nucleus, its localization may influence the specific signaling readout. To better understand how TOR can associate with different membranes, the lipid-binding properties of the redox-sensitive yeast TOR1 FATC domain (y1fatc) have been characterized by solution NMR spectroscopy. Binding studies with different lipids indicate that y1fatc interacts specifically with a membrane-mimetic environment but appears not to recognize a specific lipid headgroup. In both, the structures of oxidized and reduced micelle-bound y1fatc, residues Ile-2456 to Trp-2470 of the lipid-binding motif form a hydrophobic bulb that has a rim of charged residues. The diffusion constants for both micelle-bound states are consistent with the rotational correlation times from the analysis of the (15)N relaxation data. Based on the K(d) values, the oxidized form (K(d) approximately 0.31 mm) binds dodecyl phosphocholine micelles slightly tighter than the reduced form (K(d) approximately 1.86 mM). Binding studies with y1fatc in which one or both tryptophans (Trp-2466 and Trp-2470) were replaced by alanine suggest that these residues are important for the exact positioning in the membrane and that the other aromatic (His-2462, Tyr-2463, and Phe-2469) and aliphatic residues (Ile-2456, Leu-2459, Ile-2464, and Pro-2468) in the lipid-binding motif contribute significantly to the affinity."

As essential sensors to various cellular stress signals, receptor-interacting protein (RIP) family, a group of Ser/Thr protein kinases, consists of seven members, including the relatively well characterized RIP (or RIP1), RIP2 (RICK/CARDIAK), and RIP3 (RIPK3), that have been implicated in the regulation of cell survival and cell death (29.Meylan E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). RIP family members share a highly homologous amino-terminal serine-threonine kinase domain but possess distinctly different carboxyl termini (29.Meylan E. Tschopp J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 151-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that RIP1 is obligated to tumor necrosis factor receptor-1-mediated NF-κB activation and induces apoptosis and necrosis when overexpressed (30.Degterev A. Yuan J.

A large body of evidence suggests that RIP3 is also essentially involved in the tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 signaling pathway (33.Sun X. Lee J. Navas T. Baldwin D.T. Stewart T.A. Dixit V.M. J.

Moreover, in response to death receptor ligands, RIP3 can mediate both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptosis as well as NF-κB activation (38.Feng S. Yang Y. Mei Y. Ma L. Zhu D.E. Hoti N. Castanares M. Wu M. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2056-2067Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). However, this perception has been challenged by the fact that in RIP3-deficient cells or mice, tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-κB activation and cell apoptosis are intact (39.Newton K. Sun X. Dixit V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1464-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that assembly of the RIP1·RIP3 complex can switch cell death from programmed apoptosis to programmed necrosis in certain cell types (40.He S. Wang L. Miao L. Wang T. Du F. Zhao L.

Here we demonstrate that mitogenic stimulation markedly elevates RIP3 expression via a PI3K/Akt-dependent mechanism and that overexpression of RIP3 suppresses VSMC proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death by inhibiting the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. These findings suggest that RIP3 functions as an activation-dependent negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt axis, contributing to the maintenance of the normal growth rate of VSMCs and, thus, preventing vascular proliferative disorders.

All procedures involving experimental animals were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the committee for animal research of Peking University, China, or from the animal facility at NIA of the National Institutes of Health and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH publication no. 86-23, revised 1985). VSMCs from WKY thoracic aorta specimens were isolated using a standard enzymatic digestion technique, as described previously (43.Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). VSMCs were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) (the serum medium). VSMC synchronization was achieved by culturing cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% FBS for 48 h. Adenoviral infection was then implemented by adding an indicated titer of Adv-rRIP3, Adv-rRIP3-C, or Adv-GFP. Infection of cultured VSMCs was highly efficient, as evidenced by ∼100% GFP-positive cells for each adenoviral vector at 50 multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) for only 24 h. The growth curves of VSMCs were examined using cell counting. Cells were first underwent mitogenic quiescence by serum starvation and viral infection with Adv-GFP, AdvorRIP3-C, or Adv-rRIP3 at 100 m.o.i. for 24 h. The cell number under these experimental conditions was used as the base line. To examine the status of VSMC proliferation, the cells were subsequently stimulated with serum (10% FBS) or PDGF (10 ng/ml), and the cell number was counted daily to day 6 after infection (Fig. 3C). Each count was an average of three repeats, whereas each data point was the average of five experiments. VSMCs seeded in 96-well plates underwent mitogenic quiescence by serum starvation for 24 h. The cells were then infected with adenovirus for 24 h followed by serum (10% FBS) stimulation. Cell proliferation was assayed by the cleavage of the tetrazolium salt MTT. After cells were incubated with MTT for 4 h at 37 °C, the culture medium was removed, and the cells were solubilized in 200 μl of DMSO. The cleavage of the tetrazolium salt MTT was quantified spectrophotometrically at 490 nm with background subtraction at 630 nm, as described previously (43.Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Balloon dilation of the left common carotid artery of male WKY rats (350–400 g) was performed as previously described (43.Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2F embolectomy balloon catheter was inserted into the left common carotid artery via the external carotid artery. Then the inflated balloon was drawn gently toward the external carotid artery. After repeating this procedure three times, the catheter was then removed. The injured artery was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 30 μl of adenoviral vectors (5 × 109 plaque-forming units/ml) expressing GFP or rRIP3 for 20 min. Arteries were collected at indicated times and embedded in paraffin to prepare cross-sections. Subsequent morphological analyses were performed in a double-blinded manner. Immunostaining of sections from injured rat carotid arteries in the presence of Adv-RIP3 or Adv-GFP infection was performed with a rabbit anti-RIP3 antibody (1:250 dilution) following the manufacture's instructions at the indicated time points after balloon injury. The same sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin. To assess the possible effect of rRIP3 gene transfer on VSMC proliferation in vivo, a PCNA immunohistochemical assay was performed 1 week after injury in sections from injured rat carotid arteries infected with Adv-rRIP3 or Adv-GFP using mouse anti-PCNA monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilution) as previously described (43.Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Sections were also counterstained with hematoxylin. The PCNA-positive cells were determined by cell counts under light microscopy using a computer-based Image-Pro Morphometric System by two independent observers in a double-blind manner. To quantitate the expression of rRIP3 in response to proliferative stimuli, synchronized VSMCs were stimulated by PDGF (10 ng/ml) or Ang II (10−7m) in 0.2% FBS-containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were collected at the indicated time points, and RNA isolation and reverse transcription were performed. Real time quantitative PCR was then performed using the DNA Engine Opticon system (MJ Research) in combination with SYBR Green dye (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (43.Chen K.H. Guo X. Ma D. Guo Y. Li Q. Yang D. Li P. Qiu X. Wen S. Xiao R.P. Tang J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 872-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The primers for rRIP3 were 5′-CTTGAACCCTTCGCTACTGC-3′ and 5′-CGAGGACCCCAAAACTGTAA-3′ as forward and the reverse, respectively. The relative mRNA level of RIP3 was normalized by 18 S levels. Real time PCR data were the average of three independent experiments, whereas each experiment was in triplicate. Proteins were prepared from cultured VSMCs or arteries. For Western blot analysis, proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and incubated overnight with an antibody reacting with rRIP3, β-actin, phosphorylated Akt, or total Akt in 4 °C overnight. The membrane was washed and then incubated with secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase in 5% nonfat milk in TBS-T buffer for 1–2 h. Detection was carried out using a chemiluminescence detection kit (Cell Signaling Technology). Cellular DNA fragmentation was quantified by the Cell Death ELISA (Roche Applied Science), which measures cytoplasmic DNA-histone complexes generated during apoptotic DNA fragmentation, following the manufacturer's instruction. 2 × 104 control or infected VSMCs were used for each test. DNA fragmentation was also assayed by DNA laddering as described (44.Herrmann M. Lorenz H.M. Voll R. Grünke M. Woith W. Kalden J.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5506-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.5 μg of DNA was loaded in each lane, size-fractioned on a 1.5% agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer, and then stained with ethidium bromide (Invitrogen). VSMCs were synchronized and infected with adenoviral vectors for 48 h and subsequently stimulated by serum to proliferate as described above. After adding serum for 18 h, the cells were harvested and fixed overnight with 70% ethanol at −20 °C. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing RNase (100 μg/ml), incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, stained for 10 min at room temperature with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml), and analyzed with a FACScan (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer. A total of 104 cells were counted for each sample, whereas a Double Discriminator Module was used only to detect single cell. Each experiment was repeated four times. Apoptotic cells in uninfected or Adv-rRIP3-infected arteries were detected in situ by TUNEL staining (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To quantify apoptotic cell death, the numbers of apoptotic cells were counted in five different slides that were evenly distributed in the vessel segment. For a gene silencing assay, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) comprising a 19-base pair stem and a 4-base pair loop structure were designed against a unique region of rat RIP3 and subcloned into the pAd/BLOCK-iTTM-DEST vector (Invitrogen). The sequences of rRIP3 siRNA are 5′-CACCGCATCAAGTTGAGGAAGTACGAATACTTCCTCAACTTGATGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAAGCATCAAGTTGAGGAAGTATTCGTACTTCCTCAACTTGATGC-3′ (antisense). The sequences of the scramble siRNA are 5′-CACCGCCTTAGGTTGGTCGAGAAACGAATTTCTCGACCAACCTAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAACCTTAGGTTGGTCGAGAAATTCGTTTCTCGACCAACCTAAGG-3′ (antisense). Adenoviral vector expressing RIP3 siRNA or the scramble siRNA were generated in HEK293 cells using the BLOCK-iT Adenoviral RNAi Expression System according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). The efficiency of gene knockdown was detected by Western blotting and functional studies at 72 h after adenoviral siRNA transfection. All data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. Comparisons among groups were analyzed by 1-way analysis of variance. A Student's t test was used for differences between two groups. Differences were considered statistically significant at a value of p < 0.05. Using differential display techniques, we cloned a cDNA that was highly expressed in primary cultured rat VSMCs subjected to homocysteine (1.0 mm for 24 h), known as an independent risky factor for atherosclerosis (45.Guthikonda S. Haynes W.G. Curr. Opin. Cardiol. 1999; 14: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and weakly expressed in untreated VSMCs. Using cDNA library screening and a 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends reaction, we cloned the full-length cDNA (GenBankTM no. NM_139342) consisting of 2015 bp before a poly(A) tail and encoding 478 amino acids (supplemental Fig. S1A). Sequence analysis revealed that the cloned cDNA shares a high sequence homology with human RIP3 (hRIP3) and mouse RIP3 (mRIP3) (supplemental Fig. S1B). Thus, we named this gene as rat RIP3 (rRIP3). Mitogenic stimuli, including various growth factors and neurohormones, play a central role in the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative disorders. To investigate the potential function of rRIP3 in vascular biology and pathophysiology, we examined rRIP3 gene expression in response to a prototypical growth factor, PDGF-BB, or a clinically relevant neurohormone, Ang II, in primary cultured WKY rat VSMCs. Both PDGF (10 ng/ml) and Ang II (100 nm) markedly elevated rRIP3 gene expression in a time-dependent manner, with their peak effects at 4 and 6 h after the treatment, respectively (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows the concentration dependence of PDGF-induced rRIP3 gene expression. Treatment of VSMCs with either PDGF (10 ng/ml) or Ang II (100 nm) also elevated rRIP3 protein level in a time-dependent manner with the maximal increase of 6.7- and 2.9-fold over base line 6 h after treatment, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D). It has been widely accepted that binding of PDGF and Ang II to their respective receptors actives multiple downstream signaling events, including PI3K- and MAPK-mediated signaling pathways. To determine whether PI3K signaling is required for these mitogenic stimuli-induced up-regulation of rRIP3, we treated cells with mechanistically different PI3K inhibitors, either LY294002 or wortmannin. Pretreatment of cells with LY294002 (10 μm) fully abolished a PDGF- or Ang II-mediated increase in rRIP3 mRNA level (Fig. 2A) and markedly blunted PDGF-induced elevation in rRIP3 protein abundance without altering its basal level (Fig. 2B). Likewise, wortmannin (50 nm) also attenuated a PDGF-induced increase in rRIP3 protein level (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that PI3K activation is essentially involved in both mitogenic stimuli mediated rRIP3 up-regulation in primary cultured VSMCs. Next, we determined whether activation of the PI3K signaling pathway per se is sufficient to elevate rRIP3 expression in VSMCs. Adenoviral gene transfer of a constitutively active PI3K mutant (Adv-CA-PI3K at 100 m.o.i.) clearly increases phosphorylation of Akt (Fig. 2D), a key downstream protein kinase of PI3K (Fig. 2D), indicating enhanced activation of PI3K-Akt signaling. Importantly, enhanced PI3K-Akt signaling augmented rRIP3 expression at both mRNA (Fig. 2C) and protein levels (Fig. 2D), whereas inhibition of Akt activity with a specific inhibitor (46.Hu Y. Qiao L. Wang S. Rong S.B. Meuillet E.J. Berggren M. Gallegos A. Powis G. Kozikowski A.P. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) significantly attenuated PDGF- and Ang II-induced up-regulation of rRIP3 (Fig. 2, E and F). Although both mitogenic agents increased ERK1/2 activation in VSMCs, inhibition of ERK1/2 with PD98059 did not alter the effects of either PDGF or Ang II on rRIP3 expression (data not shown). We next examined the potential functional consequence of rRIP3 up-regulation in cultured VSMCs and explored the underlying mechanism. Adenoviral gene transfer of rRIP3 led to a titer-dependent overexpression of rRIP3 in cultured VSMCs (Fig. 3A). For instance, infection of cells with Adv-rRIP3 at a 1"
https://openalex.org/W2069939995,"In higher eukaryotic cells, DNA molecules are present as chromatin fibers, complexes of DNA with various types of proteins; chromatin fibers are highly condensed in metaphase chromosomes during mitosis. Although the formation of the metaphase chromosome structure is essential for the equal segregation of replicated chromosomal DNA into the daughter cells, the mechanism involved in the organization of metaphase chromosomes is poorly understood. To identify proteins involved in the formation and/or maintenance of metaphase chromosomes, we examined proteins that dissociated from isolated human metaphase chromosomes by 0.4 m NaCl treatment; this treatment led to significant chromosome decondensation, but the structure retained the core histones. One of the proteins identified, HP1-BP74 (heterochromatin protein 1-binding protein 74), composed of 553 amino acid residues, was further characterized. HP1-BP74 middle region (BP74Md), composed of 178 amino acid residues (Lys(97)-Lys(274)), formed a chromatosome-like structure with reconstituted mononucleosomes and protected the linker DNA from micrococcal nuclease digestion by approximately 25 bp. The solution structure determined by NMR revealed that the globular domain (Met(153)-Thr(237)) located within BP74Md possesses a structure similar to that of the globular domain of linker histones, which underlies its nucleosome binding properties. Moreover, we confirmed that BP74Md and full-length HP1-BP74 directly binds to HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) and identified the exact sites responsible for this interaction. Thus, we discovered that HP1-BP74 directly binds to HP1, and its middle region associates with linker DNA at the entry/exit site of nucleosomal DNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2074374302,"Apolipoprotein CII (apoCII) is a necessary activator for lipoprotein lipase (LPL). We had identified four residues (Tyr-63, Ile-66, Asp-69, and Gln-70), presumably contained in an alpha-helix, as a potential binding site for LPL. We have now used structure prediction, mutagenesis, and functional assays to explore the functional role of the secondary structure in this part of apoCII. First, mutants were generated by replacements with proline residues to disturb the helical structure. Activation by mutant G65P was reduced by 30%, whereas mutant S54P retained activation ability. Mutants V71P and L72P should be located outside the LPL-binding site, but V71P was totally inactive, whereas activation by L72P was reduced by 65%. Insertion of alanine after Tyr-63, changing the position of the putative LPL-binding site in relation to the hydrophobic face of the alpha-helix, also severely impeded the activation ability, and a double mutant (Y63A/I66A) was completely inactive. Next, to investigate the importance of conserved hydrophobic residues in the C-terminal end of apoCII, Phe-67, Val-71, Leu-72, and Leu-75 were exchanged for polar residues. Only F67S showed dramatic loss of function. Finally, fragment 39-62, previously claimed to activate LPL, was found to be completely inactive. Our data support the view that the helical structure close to the C-terminal end of apoCII is important for activation of LPL, probably by placing residues 63, 66, 69, and 70 in an optimal steric position. The structural requirements for the hydrophobic face on the back side of this helix and further out toward the C terminus were less stringent."
https://openalex.org/W1972653078,"Many studies assume stock prices follow a random process known as geometric Brownian motion. Although approximately correct, this model fails to explain the frequent occurrence of extreme price movements, such as stock market crashes. Using a large collection of data from three different stock markets, we present evidence that a modification to the random model -- adding a slow, but significant, fluctuation to the standard deviation of the process -- accurately explains the probability of different-sized price changes, including the relative high frequency of extreme movements. Furthermore, we show that this process is similar across stocks so that their price fluctuations can be characterized by a single curve. Because the behavior of price fluctuations is rooted in the characteristics of volatility, we expect our results to bring increased interest to stochastic volatility models, and especially to those that can produce the properties of volatility reported here."
https://openalex.org/W2083547767,"The basic concept of conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAD) as oncolytic agents is that progenies generated from each round of infection will disperse, infect and kill new cancer cells. However, CRAD has only inhibited, but not eradicated tumor growth in xenograft tumor therapy, and CRAD therapy has had only marginal clinical benefit to cancer patients. Here, we found that CRAD propagation and cancer cell survival co-existed for long periods of time when infection was initiated at low multiplicity of infection (MOI), and cancer cell killing was inefficient and slow compared to the assumed cell killing effect upon infection at high MOI. Excessive production of fiber molecules from initial CRAD infection of only 1 to 2% cancer cells and their release prior to the viral particle itself caused a tropism-specific receptor masking in both infected and non-infected bystander cells. Consequently, the non-infected bystander cells were inefficiently bound and infected by CRAD progenies. Further, fiber overproduction with concomitant restriction of adenovirus spread was observed in xenograft cancer therapy models. Besides the CAR-binding Ad4, Ad5, and Ad37, infection with CD46-binding Ad35 and Ad11 also caused receptor masking. Fiber overproduction and its resulting receptor masking thus play a key role in limiting CRAD functionality, but potentially promote adenovirus and host cell co-existence. These findings also give important clues for understanding mechanisms underlying the natural infection course of various adenoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2158639663,"Rhodopsin is an extensively studied member of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although rhodopsin shares many features with the other GPCRs, it exhibits unique features as a photoreceptor molecule. A hallmark in the molecular structure of rhodopsin is the covalently bound chromophore that regulates the activity of the receptor acting as an agonist or inverse agonist. Here we show the pivotal role of the covalent bond between the retinal chromophore and the lysine residue at position 296 in the activation pathway of bovine rhodopsin, by use of a rhodopsin mutant K296G reconstituted with retinylidene Schiff bases. Our results show that photoreceptive functions of rhodopsin, such as regiospecific photoisomerization of the ligand, and its quantum yield were not affected by the absence of the covalent bond, whereas the activation mechanism triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal was severely affected. Furthermore, our results show that an active state similar to the Meta-II intermediate of wild-type rhodopsin did not form in the bleaching process of this mutant, although it exhibited relatively weak G protein activity after light irradiation because of an increased basal activity of the receptor. We propose that the covalent bond is required for transmitting structural changes from the photoisomerized agonist to the receptor and that the covalent bond forcibly keeps the low affinity agonist in the receptor, resulting in a more efficient G protein activation."
https://openalex.org/W2077467050,"Background Osmotic Response Element-Binding Protein (OREBP), also known as TonEBP or NFAT5, is a unique transcription factor. It is hitherto the only known mammalian transcription factor that regulates hypertonic stress-induced gene transcription. In addition, unlike other monomeric members of the NFAT family, OREBP exists as a homodimer and it is the only transcription factor known to bind naked DNA targets by complete encirclement in vitro. Nevertheless, how OREBP interacts with target DNA, also known as ORE/TonE, and how it elicits gene transcription in vivo, remains unknown. Methodology Using hypertonic induction of the aldose reductase (AR) gene activation as a model, we showed that OREs contained dynamic nucleosomes. Hypertonic stress induced a rapid and reversible loss of nucleosome(s) around the OREs. The loss of nucleosome(s) was found to be initiated by an OREBP-independent mechanism, but was significantly potentiated in the presence of OREBP. Furthermore, hypertonic induction of AR gene was associated with an OREBP-dependent hyperacetylation of histones that spanned the 5′ upstream sequences and at least some exons of the gene. Nevertheless, nucleosome loss was not regulated by the acetylation status of histone. Significance Our findings offer novel insights into the mechanism of OREBP-dependent transcriptional regulation and provide a basis for understanding how histone eviction and transcription factor recruitment are coupled."
https://openalex.org/W2025629959,"The acceptability and feasibility of provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) in many settings across Asia with concentrated HIV epidemics is not known. A pilot study of the PITC policy undertaken within the public health care systems in two districts in India offered the opportunity to understand patient's perspectives on the process of referral for HIV testing and linking to HIV treatment and care.We conducted a cross-sectional study of randomly selected TB patients registered by the TB control program between July and November 2007 in two districts in south India. Trained interviewers met patients shortly after TB diagnosis and administered a structured questionnaire. Patients were assessed regarding their experience with HIV status assessment, referral for counseling and testing, and for HIV-infected patients the counseling itself and subsequent referral for HIV treatment and care.Of the 568 interviewed TB patients, 455 (80%) reported being referred for HIV testing after they presented to the health facility for investigations or treatment for TB. Over half the respondents reported having to travel long distances and incurred financial difficulties in reaching the Integrated Counselling and Testing Centre (ICTC) and two-thirds had to make more than two visits. Only 48% reported having been counseled before the test. Of the 110 HIV-infected patients interviewed, (including 43 with previously-known positive HIV status and 67 detected by PITC), 89 (81%) reported being referred for anti-retroviral treatment (ART); 82 patients reached the ART centre but only 44 had been initiated on ART.This study provides the first evidence from India that routine, provider-initiated voluntary HIV testing of TB patients is acceptable, feasible and can be achieved with very high efficiency under programmatic conditions. While PITC is useful in identifying new HIV-infected patients so that they can be successfully linked to ART, the convenience and proximity of testing centres, quality of HIV counseling, and efficiency of ART services need attention."
https://openalex.org/W2131601043,"Background Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) is characterized by fever, rash, hypotension, constitutional symptoms, and multi-organ involvement and is caused by Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins such as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B (SEB). SEB binds to the MHC-IIα chain and is recognized by the TCRβ chain of the Vβ8 TCR+ T cells. The binding of SEB to Vβ chain results in rapid activation of T cells and production of inflammatory cytokines, such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2), Interferon-γ and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α which mediate TSS. Although IL2 was originally identified as the T cell growth factor and was proposed to contribute to T cell differentiation, its role in TSS remains unexplored. Methodology/Principal Findings Mice were injected with D-Gal (25 mg/mouse). One hour after D-Galactosamine (D-Gal) injection each mouse was injected with SEB (20 µg/mouse. Mice were then observed for 72 hrs and death was recorded at different times. We tested Interleukin-12, IFNγ, and IL-2 deficient mice (IL-2−/−), but only the IL-2 deficient mice were resistant to SEB induced toxic shock syndrome. More importantly reconstitution of IL-2 in IL-2 deficient mice restored the shock. Interestingly, SEB induced IL-2 production from T cells was dependent on p38MAPK activation in macrophages as inhibition of it in macrophages significantly inhibited IL-2 production from T cells. Conclusion This study shows the importance of IL -2 in TSS which has not been previously explored and it also shows that regulating macrophages function can regulate T cells and TSS."
https://openalex.org/W2166579519,"The proximal promoter regions of heat-shock genes harbor a remarkable number of P transposable element (TE) insertions relative to both positive and negative control proximal promoter regions in natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We have screened the sequenced genomes of 12 species of Drosophila to test whether this pattern is unique to these populations. In the 12 species' genomes, transposable element insertions are no more abundant in promoter regions of single-copy heat-shock genes than in promoters with similar or dissimilar architecture. Also, insertions appear randomly distributed across the promoter region, whereas insertions clustered near the transcription start site in promoters of single-copy heat-shock genes in D. melanogaster natural populations. Hsp70 promoters exhibit more TE insertions per promoter than all other genesets in the 12 species, similarly to in natural populations of D. melanogaster. Insertions in the Hsp70 promoter region, however, cluster away from the transcription start site in the 12 species, but near it in natural populations of D. melanogaster. These results suggest that D. melanogaster heat-shock promoters are unique in terms of their interaction with transposable elements, and confirm that Hsp70 promoters are distinctive in TE insertions across Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W1978400606,"Recent studies have shown evidence for the coevolution of functionally-related genes. This coevolution is a result of constraints to maintain functional relationships between interacting proteins. The studies have focused on the correlation in gene tree branch lengths of proteins that are directly interacting with each other. We here hypothesize that the correlation in branch lengths is not limited only to proteins that directly interact, but also to proteins that operate within the same pathway. Using generalized linear models as a basis of identifying correlation, we attempted to predict the gene ontology (GO) terms of a gene based on its gene tree branch lengths. We applied our method to a dataset consisting of proteins from ten prokaryotic species. We found that the degree of accuracy to which we could predict the function of the proteins from their gene tree varied substantially with different GO terms. In particular, our model could accurately predict genes involved in translation and certain ribosomal activities with the area of the receiver-operator curve of up to 92%. Further analysis showed that the similarity between the trees of genes labeled with similar GO terms was not limited to genes that physically interacted, but also extended to genes functioning within the same pathway. We discuss the relevance of our findings as it relates to the use of phylogenetic methods in comparative genomics."
https://openalex.org/W2161363335,"Background In one group of gene mutations that cause photoreceptor degeneration in human patients, guanylyl cyclase is overactive in the dark. The ensuing excess opening of cGMP-gated cation channels causes intracellular calcium to rise to toxic levels. The Y99C mutation in guanylate cyclase-activating protein 1 (GCAP1) has been shown to act this way. We determined whether prolonged light exposure, which lowers cGMP levels through activation of phototransduction, might protect photoreceptors in a line of transgenic mice carrying the GCAP1-Y99C. Methodology/Principal Findings We reared cohorts of GCAP1-Y99C transgenic mice under standard cyclic, constant dark and constant light conditions. Mouse eyes were analyzed by histology and by immunofluorescence for GFAP upregulation, a non-specific marker for photoreceptor degeneration. Full-field electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded to assess retinal function. Consistent with our hypothesis, constant darkness accelerated disease, while continuous lighting arrested photoreceptor degeneration. Conclusions/Significance In contrast to most forms of retinal degeneration, which are exacerbated by increased exposure to ambient light, a subset with mutations that cause overly active guanylyl cyclase and high intracellular calcium benefitted from prolonged light exposure. These findings may have therapeutic implications for patients with these types of genetic defects."
