https://openalex.org/W2071290167,"Simultaneous recordings were made from large ensembles of hippocampal ""place cells"" in three rats during spatial behavioral tasks and in slow-wave sleep preceding and following these behaviors. Cells that fired together when the animal occupied particular locations in the environment exhibited an increased tendency to fire together during subsequent sleep, in comparison to sleep episodes preceding the behavioral tasks. Cells that were inactive during behavior, or that were active but had non-overlapping spatial firing, did not show this increase. This effect, which declined gradually during each post-behavior sleep session, may result from synaptic modification during waking experience. Information acquired during active behavior is thus re-expressed in hippocampal circuits during sleep, as postulated by some theories of memory consolidation."
https://openalex.org/W1991435932,"To learn about the carboxy-terminal extent of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) composition of senile plaques (SPs) in the brain affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD), we employed two end-specific monoclonal antibodies as immunocytochemical probes: one is specific for A beta 40, the carboxyl terminus of A beta 1-40, while the other is specific for A beta 42(43). In the AD cortex, all SPs that were labeled with an authentic antibody were A beta 42(43) positive, while only one-third of which, on the average, were A beta 40 positive. There was a strong correlation between A beta 40 positivity and mature plaques. Two familial AD cortices with the mutation of beta-amyloid protein precursor 717 (beta APP717) (Val to Ile) showed a remarkable predominance of A beta 42(43)-positive, A beta 40-negative plaques. Diffuse plaques, representing the earliest stage of A beta deposition, were exclusively positive for A beta 42(43), but completely negative for A beta 40."
https://openalex.org/W2011894996,"Several paradigms of perceptual learning suggest that practice can trigger long-term, experience-dependent changes in the adult visual system of humans. As shown here, performance of a basic visual discrimination task improved after a normal night's sleep. Selective disruption of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep resulted in no performance gain during a comparable sleep interval, although non-REM slow-wave sleep disruption did not affect improvement. On the other hand, deprivation of REM sleep had no detrimental effects on the performance of a similar, but previously learned, task. These results indicate that a process of human memory consolidation, active during sleep, is strongly dependent on REM sleep."
https://openalex.org/W2010745090,"Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a proinflammatory cytokine that specifically attracts and activates human neutrophils. A murine gene with a high degree of homology to the two known human IL-8 receptors was cloned and then deleted from the mouse genome by homologous recombination in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These mice, although outwardly healthy, had lymphadenopathy, resulting from an increase in B cells, and splenomegaly, resulting from an increase in metamyelocytes, band, and mature neutrophils. Thus, this receptor may participate in the expansion and development of neutrophils and B cells. This receptor was the major mediator of neutrophil migration to sites of inflammation and may provide a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory disease."
https://openalex.org/W2051921179,"Cellulose is the major polysaccharide of plants where it plays a predominantly structural role. A variety of highly specialized microorganisms have evolved to produce enzymes that either synergistically or in complexes can carry out the complete hydrolysis of cellulose. The structure of the major cellobiohydrolase, CBHI, of the potent cellulolytic fungus Trichoderma reesei has been determined and refined to 1.8 angstrom resolution. The molecule contains a 40 angstrom long active site tunnel that may account for many of the previously poorly understood macroscopic properties of the enzyme and its interaction with solid cellulose. The active site residues were identified by solving the structure of the enzyme complexed with an oligosaccharide, o-iodobenzyl-1-thio-beta-cellobioside. The three-dimensional structure is very similar to a family of bacterial beta-glucanases with the main-chain topology of the plant legume lectins."
https://openalex.org/W2011844193,"Repeat tracts of guanine bases found in DNA and RNA can form tetraplex structures in the presence of a variety of monovalent cations. Evidence suggests that guanine tetraplexes assume important functions within chromosomal telomeres, immunoglobulin switch regions, and the human immunodeficiency virus genome. The structure of a parallel-stranded tetraplex formed by the hexanucleotide d(TG4T) and stabilized by sodium cations was determined by x-ray crystallography to 1.2 angstroms resolution. Sharply resolved sodium cations were found between and within planes of hydrogen-bonded guanine quartets, and an ordered groove hydration was observed. Distinct intra- and intermolecular stacking arrangements were adopted by the guanine quartets. Thymine bases were exclusively involved in making extensive lattice contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2024891861,"Rho and Rac, two members of the Ras superfamily of guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins, regulate a variety of signal transduction pathways in eukaryotic cells. Upon stimulation of phagocytic cells, Rac enhances the activity of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced) (NADPH) oxidase, resulting in the production of superoxide radicals. Activation of the NADPH oxidase requires the assembly of a multimolecular complex at the plasma membrane consisting of two integral membrane proteins, gp91phox and p21phox, and two cytosolic proteins, p67phox and p47phox. Rac1 interacted directly with p67phox in a GTP-dependent manner. Modified forms of Rac with mutations in the effector site did not stimulate oxidase activity or bind to p67phox. Thus, p67phox appears to be the Rac effector protein in the NADPH oxidase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1988184428,"How the intention to act results in movement is a fundamental question of brain organization. Recent work has shown that this operation involves the cooperative interaction of large neuronal populations. A population vector method, by transforming neuronal activity to the spatial domain, was used to visualize the motor cortical representation of the hand's trajectory made by rhesus monkeys as they drew spirals. Hand path was accurately reflected by a series of population vectors calculated throughout the task. A psychophysical rule relating speed to curvature, the ""power law,"" was found in this cortical representation. The relative timing between each population vector and the corresponding portion of the movement was variable. The population vectors only preceded the movement in a predictive manner in portions of the spiral where the radius of curvature was greater than 6 centimeters. These results show that the movement trajectory is an important determinant of motor cortical activity and that this aspect of motor cortical activity may contribute only to discrete portions of the drawing movement."
https://openalex.org/W1971180899,"During the cell cycle, DNA is replicated and segregated equally into two daughter cells. The DNA damage checkpoint ensures that DNA damage is repaired before mitosis is attempted. Genetic studies of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have identified two genes, rad24 and rad25, that are required for this checkpoint. These genes encode 14-3-3 protein homologs that together provide a function that is essential for cell proliferation. In addition, S. pombe rad24 null mutants, and to a lesser extent rad25 null mutants, enter mitosis prematurely, which indicates that 14-3-3 proteins have a role in determining the timing of mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2062852790,"A family of neural RNA-binding proteins has recently been described in both vertebrates and invertebrates. We have identified a new member of this family, the Drosophila musashi (msi) locus, which is required for development of adult external sensory organs (sensilla). In contrast with wild-type sensilla, which contain two outer support cells, the msi mutation typically results in the appearance of extra outer support cells. The msi putative RNA-binding protein is localized to the nucleus and appears to be expressed in all cells in each sensillum and predominantly in neurons during embryogenesis. We propose that the msi protein regulates sensillum development by controlling the expression of target genes at the posttranscriptional level."
https://openalex.org/W2088408030,"NGF and the other neurotrophins all bind to the low affinity NGF receptor (LNGFR). Although early studies suggested that the LNGFR was absolutely required for the formation of a functional neurotrophin receptor, current evidence indicates that the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, in the absence of the LNGFR, can directly bind to and mediate responses to the neurotrophins. Here we describe a functional approach, in fibroblasts, designed to assay for the ability of the LNGFR to potentiate Trk-mediated responses to the neurotrophins. We report that although collaboration between the LNGFR and the Trks could be detected in this system, a truncated form of the LNGFR displayed a much more dramatic ability to interact functionally with each of the Trks, potentiating masked autocrine loops as well as responses to limiting amounts of exogenously provided neurotrophins."
https://openalex.org/W2044833738,"Apical dendrites constitute a prominent feature of the microcircuitry in the neocortex, yet their function is poorly understood. Using fura-2 imaging of layer 5 pyramidal neurons from slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we have investigated the Ca2+ influx into dendrites under intracellular, antidromic, synaptic, and receptor-agonist stimulation. We find three spatial patterns of Ca2+ accumulations: an apical band in the apical dendrite approximately 500 microns from the soma, an accumulation restricted to the basal dendrites, soma, and proximal apical dendrite, and a combination of both of these. We show that the apical band can be activated antidromically and synaptically and that, under blocked Na+ and K+ conductances, it generates Ca2+ spikes. Thus, the apical band may serve as a dendritic trigger zone for regenerative Ca2+ spikes or as a current amplifier for distal synaptic events. Our results suggest that the distal apical dendrite should be considered a separate functional compartment from the rest of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1974410953,"Members of the TGFβ superfamily of secreted signaling molecules regulate growth and cellular patterning during development and interact with specific type I and type II membrane receptors possessing a cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinase domain. We describe two members of the type I receptor family in Drosophila and demonstrate that they are encoded by the genes saxophone (sax) and thick veins (tkv). Further, we show that mutations that abolish sax or tkv activity cause phenotypes similar to partial or complete loss of activity, respectively, of the TGFβ homolog decapentaplegic (dpp). We propose that specification of distinct cell fates in response to different concentrations of dpp may be achieved combinatorially by the sax and tkv receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1968883761,"The zebrafish is rapidly becoming a popular model system for the study of vertebrate development because it is ideal for both embryological studies and genetic analysis. To determine if a retroviral vector pseudotyped with the envelope glycoprotein of the vesicular stomatitis virus could infect zebrafish embryos, and in particular, the cells destined to become the germ line, a pseudotyped virus was injected into blastula-stage zebrafish embryos. Fifty-one embryos were allowed to develop and eight transmitted proviral DNA to their progeny. Founders were mosaic, but as expected, transgenic F1's transmitted proviral DNA in a Mendelian fashion to the F2 progeny. Transgenic F1 fish inherited a single integrated provirus, and a single founder could transmit more than one viral integration to its progeny. These results demonstrate that this pantropic pseudotyped vector, originally developed for human gene therapy, will make the use of retroviral vectors in zebrafish possible."
https://openalex.org/W1968957805,"Neurally released agrin is thought to cluster acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and other synaptic proteins in the postsynaptic membrane during synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction. We have examined the binding of nerve and muscle agrins, which have dramatically different abilities to cluster AChRs, to the membrane proteins of Torpedo electric organ and C2 myotubes. Both bound with approximately nanomolar affinity to a single component identified as α-dystroglycan: agrin binding was blocked by antibodies to α-dystroglycan, and agrin bound to purified α-dystroglycan. Dystroglycan was altered in two genetic variants of C2 muscle cells that fail to form spontaneous clusters of AChRs and that show a diminished response to agrin. Antibodies that blocked α-dystroglycan binding, however, failed to block the clustering of AChRs by neural agrin. Although α-dystroglycan is the major agrin-binding protein in Torpedo and myotube membranes, its physiological role is unclear."
https://openalex.org/W2057591552,"Drosophila sequences at chromosomal positions 25D (Brk25D) and 43E (Brk43E) are similar to the TGF beta type I receptor serine/threonine kinases and are expressed broadly during embryogenesis. Brk25D binds dpp protein and bone morphogenetic protein 2 with high affinity. Mutations affecting Brk25D map to the gene thick veins and block the expression of two decapentaplegic-responsive (dpp-responsive) genes, dpp and labial, in the embryonic midgut. Defects in Brk25D receptor function combined with reduced expression of dpp ligand produce mutant phenotypes in the embryo and adult. Brk43E is the product of the gene saxophone, which also interacts with dpp. We conclude that dpp signaling in vivo is mediated by at least two receptors, Brk25D and Brk43E."
https://openalex.org/W1970855422,"Frequently, DNA in vivo is organized into loops that are partially underwound and consequently form interwound helical supercoils. Methods from polymer statistical mechanics are used to show how the competition between entropy (thermal fluctuations) and elastic energy determines supercoil radius and pitch, in good agreement with recent experiments and simulations. Supercoil reorganization by means of slithering (reptation) of the DNA along the supercoil is argued to be a slow process. Extension of supercoiled DNA by an applied force shows a number of unexpected features, including coexistence of interwound and helical states."
https://openalex.org/W2169366310,"The expansion of CTG repeats in DNA occurs in or near genes involved in several human diseases, including myotonic dystrophy and Huntington's disease. Nucleosomes, the basic structural element of chromosomes, consist of 146 base pairs of DNA coiled about an octamer of histone proteins and mediate general transcriptional repression. Electron microscopy was used to examine in vitro the nucleosome assembly of DNA containing repeating CTG triplets. The efficiency of nucleosome formation increased with expanded triplet blocks, suggesting that such blocks may repress transcription through the creation of stable nucleosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1968839115,"Macrocyclic polyketides have been subjects of great interest in synthetic and biosynthetic chemistry because of their structural complexity and medicinal activities. With expression of the entire 6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase (DEBS) (10,283 amino acids) in a heterologous host, substantial quantities of 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6dEB), the aglycone of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin, and 8,8a-deoxyoleandolide, a 14-membered lactone ring identical to 6dEB except for a methyl group side chain in place of an ethyl unit, were synthesized in Streptomyces coelicolor. The biosynthetic strategy utilizes a genetic approach that facilitates rapid structural manipulation of DEBS or other modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), including those found in actinomycetes with poorly developed genetic methods. From a technological viewpoint, this approach should allow the rational design of biosynthetic products and may eventually lead to the generation of diverse polyketide libraries by means of combinatorial cloning of naturally occurring and mutant PKS modules."
https://openalex.org/W2001567144,"The distribution of the metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluR2 and mGluR3 was immunohistochemically examined in the rat cerebellar cortex at both light and electron microscope levels. An antibody was raised against a fusion protein containing a C-terminal portion of mGluR2. On immunoblot, the antibody reacted with both mGluR2 and mGluR3 in rat brain. mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity was expressed in cell bodies, dendrites, and axon terminals of Golgi cells, as well as in presumed glial processes. Golgi axon terminals with mGluR2/3 immunoreactivity were often encountered in the vicinity of glutamatergic mossy fiber terminals. The results suggest that transmitter glutamate may exert control influences upon Golgi cells not only through dendritic mGluR2/3, but also through axonal mGluR2/3."
https://openalex.org/W2041484652,"Human feet and toes provide a mechanism for changing the gear ratio of the ankle extensor muscles during a running step. A variable gear ratio could enhance muscle performance during constant-speed running by applying a more effective prestretch during landing, while maintaining the muscles near the high-efficiency or high-power portion of the force-velocity curve during takeoff. Furthermore, during acceleration, variable gearing may allow muscle contractile properties to remain optimized despite rapid changes in running speed. Forceplate and kinematic analyses of running steps show low gear ratios at touchdown that increase throughout the contact phase."
https://openalex.org/W2053266196,"To carry out its transformation function, the middle tumor antigen (MT) of murine polyomavirus associates with a number of cellular proteins involved in regulation of cell proliferation, including pp60c-Src, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein phosphatase 2A, Src homologous and collagen protein and growth factor receptor-binding protein 2. Here, two additional MT-associated proteins were identified as members of the 14-3-3 family of proteins. Yeast homologs of 14-3-3 proteins have recently been shown to play a role in the timing of mitosis. Thus, regulation of 14-3-3 protein function by MT may contribute to the development of neoplasia."
https://openalex.org/W2011189824,"Rab5a is a small GTPase that regulates fusion of endocytic vesicles to early endosomes. We investigated whether Rab5a is involved in early endocytic traffic in both the axonal and the somatodendritic domains of polarized neurons. Using immunofluorescence, endogenous Rab5a was detected in axons and dendrites. Its localization in axons strongly overlapped that of the synaptic vesicle protein synaptophysin. Indeed, Rab5a co-immunoisolated with synaptophysin-containing vesicles, and antibodies against Rab5a labeled synaptic vesicle-like structures in nerve terminals. The functional association of Rab5a with dendritic and axonal early endosomes was assayed by electron microscopy after overexpression of wild-type and mutant Rab5a in cultured hippocampal neurons. This induced the formation of abnormal endosomes in both the somatodendritic and the axonal domains. These results show a role for Rab5a in axonal and dendritic endocytosis, and the presence of Rab5a on synaptic vesicles indicates that the axonal endosomes participate in the biogenesis of these vesicles."

https://openalex.org/W2023596283,"The helical path of the DNA in filamentous bacteriophage Pf1 was deduced from different kinds of existing structural information, including results from x-ray fiber diffraction. The DNA has the same pitch, 16 angstroms, as the surrounding helix of protein subunits; the rise and rotation per nucleotides are 6.1 angstroms and 132 degrees, respectively; and the phosphates are 2.5 angstroms from the axis. The DNA in Pf1 is, therefore, the most extended and twisted DNA structure known. On the basis of the DNA structure and extensive additional information about the protein, a model of the virion is proposed. In the model, the DNA bases reach out, into the protein, and the lysine and arginine side chains reach in, between the DNA bases, to stabilize the paraxial phosphate charges; the conformation of the protein subunit is a combination of alpha and 3(10) helices."
https://openalex.org/W2039867424,"Although we now have extensive knowledge about the GABAA receptor subunits determining benzodiazepine modulation of channel function, little is known about subunits influencing other modulatory sites on the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex. We have identified a developmental change in subunit composition of the GABAA receptor in cultured cerebellar granule neurons that eliminates benzodiazepine-mediated enhancement of GABA responses and alters modulation by a substituted gamma-butyrolactone. Based on data from sequential PCR experiments, we mimicked the functional properties of early and mature receptors with heterologous expression of specific subunit combinations. This report describes one of the most extensive cell- and site-specific developmental changes for an ion channel seen to date."
https://openalex.org/W1971388369,"Previously, a tissue-specific fate map was compiled for the gastrula stage of the zebrafish embryo, indicating that development subsequent to this stage follows a reproducible pattern. Here it is shown that each early zebrafish blastomere normally contributes to a subset of the gastrula and thus gives rise to a limited array of tissues. However, the final contribution that any early blastomere makes to the fate map in the gastrula cannot be predicted because of variability in both the position of the future dorsoventral axis with respect to the early cleavage blastomeres and the scattering of daughter cells as the gastrula is formed. Therefore, early cell divisions of the zebrafish embryo cannot reproducibly segregate determinants of tissue fates."

https://openalex.org/W1582584373,"CD4 cross-linking by antibodies or its natural ligands triggers a tyrosine kinase activity that is one of the necessary steps in the mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-induced syncytium formation and full Th-cell activation. In this study we mapped a part of the dimerization site of human CD4 to amino acids 87-98 using a bivalent CD4 immunoadhesin and a series of overlapping 12-mer peptides of the D1 domain. The dimerization site we found is part of the complementary determining region (CDR) 3-like region of CD4. Using the three-dimensional structure of other immunoglobulin dimers as a basis, a molecular modeling study was performed to dimerize the D1 domains of CD4. Both the peptide binding studies and molecular modeling studies independently led to the conclusion that the CDR3-like region is part of the CD4 dimerization site. The suggested dimerization of CD4 through its CDR3-like region explains the important role that has been ascribed to this region in Th-cell activation and HIV-1-mediated fusion. Based on this model of the CD4 dimer and published results of different mutational analysis studies, a model was proposed for the complex of the CD4 dimer with two MHC-II molecules. The CD4 dimer allows tight binding to a large surface of MHC-II and the complex of CD4 and MHC-II reconciles mutational analysis studies that were previously incompatible. Moreover, the complex suggests how CD4 can dimerize through ligand binding."
https://openalex.org/W2070914387,"With 90 mM Ba2+, the main Ca2+ current in frog sympathetic neurons peaks near +30 mV and is blocked by ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CgTx). It is modulated by norepinephrine (NE) in a voltage-dependent manner via a membrane-delimited mechanism. Surprisingly, a different current dominates at more negative voltages (−30 to +10 mV). That novel current is not sensitive to selective blockers of L- or N-type channels (respectively, dihydropyridines or ω-CgTx) and is inhibited weakly if at all by NE. It is selectively inactivated at −40 mV and is selectively blocked by Ni2+, whereas Cd2+ is slightly more potent against the main current. The novel current is associated with a 19 pS channel (0.6 pA at 0 mV). This channel may have been misidentified as the single-channel correlate of the whole-cell N-type Ca2+ current in some previous studies."

https://openalex.org/W2005765265,"We have investigated the role of intracellular cytoplasmic sequences in the assembly of the mouse muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) transiently expressed in COS cells. A chimeric protein in which the region from M1 to M4 of the alpha subunit was replaced by the corresponding region in the beta subunit was unable to support AChR assembly when substituted for the alpha subunit; a chimeric alpha subunit containing only the long cytoplasmic loop from the beta subunit was likewise inactive. Systematic mutation of short segments of the loop identified a sequence of 17 amino acids near the C-terminal end of the loop for which the beta sequence could not be substituted. Each of the inactive chimeric and mutated alpha subunits bound alpha-bungarotoxin when expressed alone and formed a heterodimer when expressed with the delta subunit. An alpha subunit truncated after M1 formed both an alpha delta heterodimer and an alpha delta beta heterotrimer, demonstrating that the cytoplasmic loop is dispensable for the early steps of assembly. A sequence in the long cytoplasmic loop of the alpha subunit thus appears to play a role in a late step of AChR assembly."

https://openalex.org/W1960160624,"Abstract The gene encoding UDP-GlcNAc:dolichol phosphate N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate transferase (GPT), the enzyme that initiates the pathway for the biosynthesis of asparagine-linked glycoproteins, was isolated and characterized. Southern blot analyses demonstrated a single copy gene for GPT. The gene spans about 7.5 kilobase pairs of DNA and is divided into 9 exons by 8 introns. All the introns are found in the coding region, and most of them occur in segments separating the putative membrane-spanning domains. The exon/intron organization of the gene also correlates with the presence of several highly conserved regions of potential functional importance among yeast, leishmania, hamster, and mouse enzymes. Primer extension and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses suggested the presence of several potential transcription start sites, with the closest one being approximately 200 base pairs upstream from the translation initiation codon. The 5'-flanking region lacks a typical TATA box, but is high in GC content and contains two putative Sp1 binding sites (GC boxes), consistent with promoters described for housekeeping genes. The 3'-end reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis indicated that the first of the two polyadenylation sites was used predominantly, in agreement with a approximately 2.0-kilobase pair GPT message seen on Northern blots of RNA from a wide variety of mouse tissues. This is the first report of cloning of a gene for an enzyme of the dolichol cycle in higher eukaryotes. A novel finding of this study is the observation of a G-->A change between the genomic sequence and nucleotide 280 in the cDNA. This could have important implications as an RNA editing mechanism for regulating the expression of the gene and therefore, protein N-glycosylation. A previous study (11) had shown that the activity of GPT was developmentally regulated in mouse mammary gland, with possible involvement by the hormone prolactin. The availability of the GPT gene with its promoter should facilitate future studies on delineating the mechanism for the hormonal regulation of GPT."
